MERCEDES SL500 TAKES THE HIGH ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's one of the best privileges of wealth, the Mercedes-Benz
SL500, a showy bauble most likely spotted on Scottsdale Road or in
the front row of nightclub parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes, like the well-equipped Sport version, serving as
a companion for an interesting romp over a mountain road.
</P>
<P>
   The SL500 is one of the broadest statements of disposable
wealth, serving notice to the world that you have arrived. Or, if
you prefer to swim even farther upstream, there's the 12-cylinder
SL600 for a cool $45,000 more.
</P>
<P>
   SL500 shoppers should rejoice that Mercedes has dropped the
price a full 11 percent under last year's V-8 model, which comes to
a $10,000 reduction. Or about one Chrysler Neon.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of which, under the new dynamics of the Chrysler-Benz
megamerger, the SL might be going up against one of its own, the
awesome V-10 Dodge Viper sports car. And if you count the Viper and
Mercedes' hot C43, the merged company will have sporting cars
powered by V-6, V-8, V-10 and V-12 engines.
</P>
<P>
   The SL500 is not exactly a sports car, though it has more than
four decades of sporting history behind it, going back to the
glorious 300SL Gullwings and roadsters, raced in the '50s by such
stars as Stirling Moss.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Mercedes' image machine is more of a heavy cruiser among
fast GTs, endowed with enough style and panache to make performance
something of a secondary issue.
</P>
<P>
   Our test car was set up with the Sport package, basically a
$5,000 package of performance tires and wheels plus aerodynamics
additions. The aero add-ons do little more than make the Benz look
more rakish, but the huge 18-inch rims and low-profile Z-rated
tires seem to have a major effect on the roadster's ride and
handling.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, they give the heavy car a much sportier edge. In a
fast drive on Arizona 89A over Mingus Mountain and back again, the
SL soared through the many hairpin curves with an excellent feeling
of balance and steering precision.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with an SL that I drove over the same route a couple
years back, the new car felt more poised and responsive, and not
nearly as encumbered by its 2-ton heft.
</P>
<P>
   The slick silver roadster had a noticeably firmer ride than
``normal'' SL500s, undoubtedly the result of the low-profile tires.
</P>
<P>
   Derrieres more used to luxury rides might find the bumps and
rumbles objectionable, but I thought the stiffness made the car
feel more edgy and ready to run.
</P>
<P>
   The mountain grades were no match for the strong V-8, which
roars in an aggressive race-car timbre when pushed into the upper
revs. This is a sweet engine, with lots of torque throughout its
range.
</P>
<P>
   The five-speed automatic, which adjusts electronically to
accommodate driver's inputs from sedate to aggressive, and even
road grades, performs flawlessly, mating well with the flexible
engine power.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes' customary ``gated'' shifter makes it easier to shift
manually, which is helpful when downshifting for curves, but it
seems a shame there's no stick shift available for this car.
</P>
<P>
   The test SL was equipped with Mercedes' Electronic Stability
System, or ESP, that can sense skidding and apply the brake to any
one of the wheels to restore control. It's designed to keep drivers
from getting in too much over their heads, though some drivers
might find it an unwelcome intrusion.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto for the traction-control system, which senses rear-wheel
spin, then brakes or cuts back engine power to restore traction.
Although appreciated in snow or other slippery conditions, this
system also can intrude, feeling like someone suddenly dropping the
anchor.
</P>
<P>
   The car also was equipped with a special brake-assist system
that actually shortens stopping distance, particularly in a
panic-stop situation. On initial input, though, the brake pedal
feels weird, as if the brakes might not grab. They do, of course,
and work very well, but that fleeting panic is disconcerting.
</P>
<P>
   Other safety systems include twin roll bars that pop up behind
the seats if the car senses an impending flip, and a sensor in the
passenger seat that turns off the right-side airbag unless somebody
weighing 26 pounds or more is sitting there. Also, a special baby
car seat can be purchased that automatically shuts off the
passenger side air bag when it's belted into place.
</P>
<P>
   The interior of the SL is attractive, solid and functional, in
usual Benz fashion, with an overall feel of refinement and
sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   One complaint, and it's a common one for Mercedes: The leather
seats are just too flat and hard, becoming decidedly uncomfortable
after a couple of hours. These seats do break in nicely after a
while, but it would be nice if they started out comfortable, too.
</P>
<P>
   One more thing. The front apron for the aerodynamics package
turns out to be unacceptably fragile. After just 4,000 miles, the
test car's apron already had suffered two incidents of cracks and
damaged supporting structures from minor encounters with curbs,
each of which required repairs at a dealership.
</P>
<P>
   The test car came equipped with an attractive hardtop, one of
three tops available for the SL, including a fabric top that
disappears into the trunk with a touch of a button and a new
tinted-glass hardtop that allows an unobstructed skyward view.
</P>
<P>
   One problem with the hardtop: It didn't allow me the opportunity
to travel in the open air, the best way to appreciate an SL.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the SL500 is prohibitively expensive for most people, but
it does serve as a technological tour de force for Mercedes-Benz
even while upholding the German marque's sporting tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Solid and well-built, it can last for decades, as most of them
have, while holding its value and eventually becoming collectors'
items. &QL;

NEW LAKERS ARE ALL SMILES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Tony Battie is a man in search of a new name
tag.
</P>
<P>
   The player dubbed ``El Busto'' in Denver arrived in Los Angeles
on Friday to receive a purple-and-gold jersey and a new start on
his NBA career. A fresh label should accompany his fresh start.
</P>
<P>
   ``El Smile-o'' might be more appropriate now. Maybe ``Sir
Grin-a-lot.'' Battie could hardly contain his relief and joy at
becoming a Laker, flashing a gap-toothed grin often during his
introduction to the media at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been praying, not for a trade, but for something
positive to happen to me.... I guess my prayers were answered,''
said Battie, dealt from the 11-win Nuggets to the 61-win Lakers on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The second-year forward, a No. 5 pick in 1997, and rookie point
guard Tyronn Lue were acquired Wednesday night in the trade that
sent Nick Van Exel to Denver. Battie and Lue passed their physical
exams Friday morning, then took part in the meet-the-media session,
along with draft picks Sam Jacobson and Ruben Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are high on all four prospects _ ``We think we've
added some tremendous players here,'' executive Jerry West said _
and the foursome was thrilled to join a championship contender.
None more so than Battie, who got the fateful phone call shortly
after the draft ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``My phone rang. It was Denver saying they'd traded me to the
Lakers, and I've been awake ever since,'' Battie said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-11 forward was highly regarded coming out of Texas
Tech but had difficulty fulfilling expectations on the undermanned
Nuggets. Commentator and now general manager Dan Issel gave him the
bust label, and the fans turned as well as Battie and the Nuggets
underachieved their way to the worst record in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   Having given up an All-Star to get Battie, the Lakers have
expectations too. But he doesn't have to carry the team here _
Shaquille O'Neal and Eddie Jones take care of that _ and Battie
might be able to relax a little in his second NBA campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a comfort zone there, I think,'' he said. ``The
picture has already been put together, and I'm just a piece of the
puzzle. I'll just contribute any way I can.''
</P>
<P>
   That could mean spotting O'Neal at center or even starting at
power forward depending on how he performs and on what other
changes the Lakers make before the season begins.
</P>
<P>
   Lue figures to be the primary backup to Derek Fisher at point
guard unless Kobe Bryant becomes a passer in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dream come true,'' Lue said. ``Right now I'm still
shocked that I'm even in the NBA, and to get a chance to play for a
great organization like the L.A. Lakers, that's another big step.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson hopes to find time at off guard behind Jones, assuming
Bryant increases his minutes at small forward. And Patterson, an
energetic and athletic defender, could bolster the Lakers' small
forward ranks if Rick Fox doesn't return.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson already has the Lakers mindset down pat.
</P>
<P>
   ``With me, Eddie and Kobe out on the floor at the same time,
they better watch out,'' he said. ``There's gonna be some
Showtime.''

Bullpen offers no relief for Astros
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
CLEVELAND _ The sweet smell of Colon combined with the stench of
their own bullpen created an aroma that has become all too familiar
for the Astros on this road trip.
</P>
<P>
   For the third consecutive day, the Astros failed to sniff out a
victory. And Mike Magnante was again the fall guy in Friday night's
4-2 loss to the Cleveland Indians at Jacobs Field.
</P>
<P>
   Indians rookie Bartolo Colon vaporized the Astros with his
warp-speed fastball, and his teammates made a one-run Astros lead
disappear. The three-game losing streak ties the Astros' longest
slide of the season.
</P>
<P>
   They hadn't dropped three in a row since April 12-15 against Los
Angeles and Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Astros, the second-place Cubs (six losses in
a row) are struggling, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't the way we wanted to open this series,'' said Pete
Schourek, who started for the Astros on Friday. ``After losing
those two games in Colorado, we didn't need to drop this one. We
have to come out and get it going tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians, who have won six in a row, average 5.7 runs a game
and are theoretically vulnerable on nights when they score only
four. But four turned out to be more than enough with Colon on the
mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagine most teams that face a guy like that are going to
struggle to score runs,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said. ``He
throws the ball harder than anyone else, and he doesn't walk
anyone. He's pretty impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Astros' offense wasn't exactly clicking on all
cylinders even before Colon slammed the brakes on them. The Astros
are hitting just .220 in the first three games of the trip _ 53
points below their season average.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of firepower but haven't really shown it
lately,'' said Astros shortstop Ricky Gutierrez, who struck out to
end a classic 20-pitch confrontation against Colon in the eighth
inning. ``We're not getting enough guys on base to put pressure on
the other pitcher. We know our offense is better than what we've
been showing. We just have to forget about this one and try to
break out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Magnante (3-3) would love to forget Friday's turn of events. In
fact, he might not be opposed to wiping the first half of the
season out of his memory.
</P>
<P>
   This latest rough outing escalated his ERA to 6.37; at this
point, he doesn't look much like the pitcher who was 3-1 with a
2.27 ERA for the Astros in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's certainly not the pitcher he was last season, but I'm not
going to give up on him,'' Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros held a 2-1 lead until the Indians scored three times
off Reggie Harris and Magnante in a decisive seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   Shawon Dunston started the rally with a one-out single off
Harris and moved to second on a throwing error by Gutierrez. After
Manny Ramirez hit into a fielder's choice, Dierker called on
Magnante because two of the Indians' next three hitters were
lefthanded.
</P>
<P>
   Magnante walked both lefties he faced and served up an RBI
double to righthanded-hitting Sandy Alomar between the two free
passes.
</P>
<P>
   After jumping ahead 1-2 in the count to Mark Whiten, Magnante
couldn't finish the job. Whiten's two-run single to left gave the
Indians all the runs Colon and two relievers would need.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a base open on both of the walks, and I didn't want to
give in,'' said Magnante, who has walked nine in his last 16
innings. ``I thought I made some good pitches; they (the hitters)
just didn't go after them. I was ahead of every batter every time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whiten didn't crush that ball, but he got enough of it to hit
it where we weren't.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros scored only in the second inning, when Craig Biggio
drove home Gutierrez with an RBI single and Brad Ausmus scored as
Bill Spiers hit into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   The bullpen sabotaged a gritty effort by Schourek, who held the
Indians to one run before reaching his pitch limit after five
innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians loaded the bases against Schourek with no outs in
the first inning and seemed poised to bust the game open early. But
Schourek got two strikeouts and a line drive to the infield to
escape.
</P>
<P>
   Schourek, who threw 102 pitches, allowed five runners to reach
scoring position. Omar Vizquel was the only Indian who scored
during his watch, coming home on Ramirez's ground ball to
shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pete did a great job of holding those guys down,'' Dierker
said. ``But because of his elbow (offseason surgery), we're still
keeping his pitches at around 100.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept us in there. When we hold this team to four runs, we
have to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros couldn't get anything going against Colon after the
third inning. The rookie retired 16 of the final 18 batters he
faced with perhaps the best combination of velocity and command
this side of the Chicago Cubs' Kerry Wood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't do much on offense, but that's because that kid
ain't easy to hit,'' said Astros right fielder Derek Bell, whose
career-best 14-game hitting streak came to an end. ``There really
wasn't anything we could do except tip our hats to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Colon (8-4) held the Astros to five hits and struck out seven in
eight innings before relievers Paul Assenmacher and Mike Jackson
finished off the Astros. Jackson retired the meat of the order _
Bell, Jeff Bagwell and Moises Alou _ for his 17th save.

<TEXT>
<P>
   To learn more about the state of relations between the United
States and China, look at a few of the things that are not
happening during President Clinton's nine-day trip to China.
</P>
<P>
   Though he has an official delegation of 1,000 people, not one
represents an American company. Some U.S. companies will sign
contracts during the visit, but Clinton does not plan to attend
that ceremony. The president considered stopping by a new General
Motors Corp. auto factory in Shanghai, but decided against it.
</P>
<P>
   None of that means business has fallen off the U.S.-China
agenda. In fact, Clinton may be downplaying commercial links
precisely because they have become such a dominant bilateral issue:
The political scandal made up of China's business ambitions,
high-tech exports and campaign contributions has dogged him at
home.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, the fact that the president's trip focuses on
diplomatic strategy, culture and tourism instead of commerce is a
sign that business ties have in some ways outgrown the
contract-by-contract nurturing required during the 1980s or the
early 1990s, when many visiting American dignitaries traveled with
planes full of chief executives seeking high-level contacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is not exactly virgin territory for American business,''
said Robert Kapp, president of the U.S.-China Business Council.
``They are there in force. It is not as though they need the
president to let them in on the best kept secret in world trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1980s, when the Occidental Petroleum Corp., the
former American Motors and a handful of other pioneers first
planted stakes in China, China investment has gone from adventurous
to ordinary. More than half of the Fortune 500 companies have
operations there, and smaller companies are also active, down to
entrepreneurs whose only business is in China.
</P>
<P>
   In the early part of this decade, many companies set up
factories in China to manufacture goods for export or began
aggressively marketing their products in China, a spree that shows
few signs of letting up despite China's slowing economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, American companies had two-way trade with China
valued at about $75 billion. They have invested a cumulative $36
billion, eight times as much as they had committed when George Bush
visited China in 1989, the last American president to make the
trip. Among Asian countries, only Japan has a bigger business
relationship with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Like the broader relationship, the state of commercial ties has
long been described in absolutes. Chinese government officials are
seen as either friends or foes of business. The Chinese market is
called a salvation for some companies and a sinkhole for others.
</P>
<P>
   But after two decades of investing, hyperbole has given way to
sober assessments of the pluses and minuses of doing business in
what many call the world's most challenging emerging market. SOme
American companies have been runaway successes; others have proven
dismal failures. Most big companies say they are there for the long
term and are prepared to take their lumps along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Eastman Kodak Co. is a good example. The company struggled for
years to distribute its film in China, while many local companies
sell lower-grade products and enjoy government protection. But
earlier this year, Beijing approved Kodak's longstanding request to
buy out three Chinese competitors, to open two factories and to put
its bright yellow boxes on store shelves nationwide. Kodak has
announced plans to invest $1 billion over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took us several years to get the deal we wanted. You have
to have patience and the willingness to stick it out,'' said David
Swift, president of Kodak's China operation. ``But since we got the
license, everything has been superb.''
</P>
<P>
   Kodak claims to sell more film in China than any other company,
domestic or foreign. Moreover, China has become Kodak's No. 3
worldwide market, behind the United States and Germany and ahead of
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Massive advertising has helped many American brands gain ground
in China. Four out of five Chinese consumers surveyed by the Gallup
Organization knew Coca-Cola, more than recognized any other foreign
brand name. Procter &AMP; Gamble Co.'s Head and Shoulders shampoo and
Chrysler Corp.'s Jeep sport-utility vehicle, made in China by the
American companies, were also in the top five.
</P>
<P>
   Profits have followed, though not as reliably as some investors
might have hoped. Figures are hard to track, as many U.S.
multinationals decline to break out sales and profits by country.
But the evidence suggests that businesses can operate profitably in
China provided they do what they would need to do anywhere else:
Develop good business plans, make products people can afford to buy
and beat the competition.
</P>
<P>
   One survey conducted by A.T. Kearney, a Chicago-based consulting
firm, asked the bosses of 70 multinationals how their ventures in
China were performing. They responded that 2 out of 5 of their
China ventures _ many have more than one _ were operating in the
black.
</P>
<P>
   They said they expected the rest to break even within three
years of their start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   China's Finance Ministry has reported similar results. A survey
completed last year found that 40 percent of foreign businesses
earned profits in 1996. The rest broke even or ran losses. Given
the huge volume of investments in the mid-1990s, which funded tens
of thousands of new ventures along China's eastern coast, some
analysts say they are surprised that so many can operate
profitably.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone finds it easy,'' said Rich Miskewicz,
Kearney's managing director for greater China. ``But they are
sticking it out and many are reaching profitability within the time
frame they planned, sometimes even faster.''
</P>
<P>
   But for every success story there is at least one bitter memory.
</P>
<P>
   Ameritech Corp., the Chicago-based Baby Bell, sought to get into
the business of providing cellular phone service in China,
investing $20 million in a venture there. But last year the company
pulled out, citing persistent regulatory obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   Caterpillar Inc., the heavy equipment maker, gave up on a
troubled joint venture with a Shanghai company, saying it had badly
overestimated the market in China for diesel engines. It remains
committed to China however, with several other factories there.
</P>
<P>
   Whirlpool Corp. opened four factories in China to make household
appliances in the mid-1990s, but closed two last year. The company
said the local competitors proved tougher than anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Among other persistent complaints, businesses say China has a
weak legal system that does not enforce contracts reliably.
</P>
<P>
   American companies lose billions of dollars a year there because
Chinese companies make illegal copies of Prozac, Windows 95,
``Titanic,'' and many famous drugs, software, movies and music that
carry American trademarks and copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some areas where American companies have shown
themselves to be fierce competitors elsewhere in the world are
effectively off-limits to foreign investors in China. Retail and
distribution, banking and transportation are a few industries where
bans or restrictions make it difficult to invest.
</P>
<P>
   American officials complain that such barriers help China run a
$50 billion trade surplus with the United States, second only to
Japan's, creating political waves in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all investors in China face some political risk, both
in China and at home, though many have learned to keep their heads
down when tensions rise. Some companies expanded through the
political repression during and after the Tiananmen Square protests
of 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Those that have withdrawn have sometimes regretted it. Levi
Strauss &AMP; Co. closed up shop in 1994, saying Beijing's violations
of human rights made it an unfit place to invest. The company
returned this spring, saying it wanted to ``untie its hands'' and
resume doing business in one of the world's biggest market for
jeans. &QL;

   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ Beyond the chalk lines that arrow into lush
green outfields, beyond the packed dirt and the pristine white
bases, beyond the dugouts and the scoreboards that chart wins and
losses, and beyond the thousands of baseball players who have
lashed away at pitched balls, there is a grander Elysian field: it
is, simply, the idea and meaning of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Every June for the last decade, a gaggle of academics
historians, anthropologists, linguists and sociologists gather at
this shrine to the game of summer to talk baseball, not as it is
played but what it means, how it shapes a culture, how it
conditions language, how it touches the soul. They come, these
scholars, in baseball hats clamped over bald pates or white hair,
and polo shirts stretched over bellies more intimate with beer than
situps, to ruminate on the game of which Walt Whitman wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``Well it's our game; that's the chief fact in connection with
it: America's game; it has the snap, go, fling of the American
atmosphere; it belongs as much to our institutions, fits into them
as significantly as our Constitution's laws; is just as important
in the sum total of our historic life.''
</P>
<P>
   Philosophizing about baseball has not, of course, remained the
preserve of academia; indeed, from political pundits like George
Will to Canadian novelist W.P. Kinsella, the stadium of rumination
remains vast. But for scholars, particularly scholars who may once
have dreamed of walking onto the field of a major league ball park,
the game and its place in American life is rich in both symbolism
and meaning; it is for many, despite its many problems, an axis on
which the American experience turns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of what is written about baseball is very narrow,'' said
Peter Rutkoff, a professor of history at Kenyon College in the
small Ohio town of Gambier, ``or baseball nuts writing for baseball
nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We say right up front,'' chimed in Alvin Hall, now a dean and
historian at the Union Institute in Cincinnati and founder of the
yearly symposium, ``that we're not interested in baseball as
baseball, but baseball as part of American culture. Baseball is
regarded as a quintessential American sport. So to understand
American culture, you have to understand baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet because these scholars claim they come here not so much to
praise baseball, there was at first a grumble of skepticism from
the guardians of the Hall of Fame about a group of (nearly all) men
who didn't care so much about scores and earned run averages or who
was the best shortstop of the 1950s. Why should the Hall, where
greatness is arrayed on bronze plaques in a nave of marble and
bleached wood, admit philosophers and linguists and historians into
its embrace, it was said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' said Hall, ``I think we demonstrated to them the
educational function of a meeting like this. And the museum at the
Hall is the broader base of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the symposium, which is sponsored by the Hall of Fame and
the State University of New York at Oneonta and whih draws between
70 and 120 scholars each year, is as much a part of Cooperstown's
summer rituals as the All-Star Game is to major league ball.
</P>
<P>
   Over three days in mid-June, the scholars, who hailed from both
coasts and much in between, surveyed the landscape of American
culture and the role of baseball, from issues of sexuality to
notions of leadership theory, from unionization to melancholy in
American life.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the outfield of ideas and reflection about baseball
seems to be without fences. Part of the Americanizing ritual
smoldering just below the surface of baseball, Thomas Altherr, a
historian at Metropolitan State College in Denver, told his
colleagues, is the pervasive sexuality that surrounds the game.
</P>
<P>
   From the reckless and relentless womanizing of many players to
condoms carrying the image of Ted Williams (the last batter to hit
over .400), even to ancient baseball-like fertility rituals.
</P>
<P>
   How ancient? ``In Mesopotamia, on the first of May, young women
underwent a puberty ritual in which they batted a rock across a
field and ran around it to ensure fertility,'' Altherr said, ``In
an additional rite, the women circled a path of four bases, each
corresponding symbolically to their own infancy, childhood,
adulthood and finally full womanhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet as Altherr pointed out, in the 19th century, baseball was
shrouded in a culture of prudishness, so much so that Ladies Days
were held so that women in the stands could provide a calming
effect on frenzied male fans. That, of course, has given way, he
said, to endless braggadocio of sexual prowess among ball players,
beginning most notably, and perhaps most appropriately, with Babe
Ruth, arguably the greatest batter of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Where this evolution of attitudes will lead, Altherr says, is
uncertain. ``Will baseball be more sexualized?'' he asked. ``How
long will it be before we have Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders? So far,
thank goodness, there's nothing like that glitzy sexuality.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanton Green, a bearded anthropologist from Pittsburgh's
Clarion University, argued that baseball, as an Americanizing
ritual, is a very important part of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the chronicle of immigrants to this country,'' Green
suggested, ``baseball has been very much a mirror of the rise and
assimilation of ethnic groups, from early Irish to the most recent
arrivals, the Japanese. The transition from Jackie Robinson to Nomo
_'' a celebrated but now troubled Japanese pitcher ``_ is a fairly
interesting reminder of this country's immigration pattern. Now,
Latin American and Asian ball players are the new immigrants.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The consequence,'' he said, ``is that the next generation of
baseball will be more global than we're used to.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Green said there is a second, and ultimately more troubling
question, however, and that is whether the game will cease to
remain a lynchpin between generations, a vehicle by which the
elements of American culture are passed from grandfather to father
to son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball has played a role in transforming children, at least
boys, into adults,'' he explained. ``Now, that's less true.
Baseball is not so much part of that initiation anymore.
Generations are cut off more. As Margaret Meade has pointed out,
the generation gap is really a culture gap, a gap in passing on
culture from one generation to the next.''
</P>
<P>
   In part, Green argued, this is because baseball has itself
changed and, as a result, what it means to children, mostly boys,
today is different from the meaning and role in children's lives in
previous generations.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, he suggested, it has become very difficult to
identify individual players with individual teams simply because
ball players move relatively easily from one team to the next. On
the other, the presentation of baseball has been transformed from
one where the game itself remained the centerpiece to a spectacle
of gifts, flashing scoreboards, dancing grounds keepers. ``Kids
want to go to the game for whatever trinket they're getting, not
for the baseball,'' he said, somewhat ruefully. ``Baseball was part
of my initiation. That's not so true anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   If this is so, he asked, it is an open question whether baseball
will continue to remain central to the Americanizing experience of
earlier immigrant generations.
</P>
<P>
   For some at the symposium, baseball touches the most profound
emotional level of existence. ``While the game displays a
significant physical beauty and radiates a spiritual
transcendence,'' said George Grella, a professor of English at the
University of Rochester, ``it also expresses the parallel
paradoxical quality of sadness.''
</P>
<P>
   Although such cultural observations veer dangerously toward the
mawkish (or worse, the pompous), a decided risk when people unleash
their rhetorical powers on the game of baseball, Grella and others
strove to cement their arguments with evidence.
</P>
<P>
   And for Grella, the stuff of sadness is voluminous, from the
solitary positioning of fielders to the wreckers' ball at Ebbets
Field. As Carl Yastrzemski, the great Boston Red Sox outfielder and
first-baseman who was the last man to win the Triple Crown, said:
``I loved the game. I loved the competition. But I never had any
fun. I never enjoyed it. All hard work, all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   In an essay he called ``The Melancholy of Baseball,'' Grella
suggested to his fellow scholars and baseball fans that the
ambiguity of the game echoes the voices of mainstream culture. ``If
baseball celebrates youth,'' he said, ``it also reminds us of
mortality; if a game can last forever, it is also an ephemeral
endeavor; it usually inspires lyric poetry, but also lends itself
to the elegiac mode. . . . it instructs us in two crucial American
concepts, the loneliness of space and the sadness of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It creates an immense green field, a gorgeous vista invoking
the pastoral, the agricultural, even the peaceable kingdom, but it
hints that the lush green garden may also be a vale of tears.
Baseball is the saddest game.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so sad, though, that the scholars refrained from crowding
around Clete Boyer, a former Yankee great, who graced the occasion
with his presence. And not so melancholy that a game of Town Ball,
an early 19th-century precursor of the modern game, played by
competing squads of slow-moving academics, ended in a redemptive
tie, 21-21.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's two sides to this conference,'' laughed Kenyon's
Rutkoff, a gangly man whose eyes glitter at the sight of a bat and
ball. ``There's the academics. But there's also the little kid
worshipping their heroes.''

SECT AGAIN MOVES INTO EMPTY APACHE JUNCTION HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT FLANNERY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only two weeks after being evicted from government-owned houses
in Mesa, defiant members of a religious sect this week took over a
privately owned Apache Junction house that had been left vacant by
its owner for renovations.
</P>
<P>
   Sect members, who had occupied the private residence for two
days, agreed to leave peacefully Friday afternoon after Apache
Junction police and a federal investigator threatened to arrest the
couple for trespassing.
</P>
<P>
   ``How in the world can this even happen?'' an infuriated Mikel
Vander Molen said Friday after the illegal occupants packed a
pickup truck with belongings and left her home as police watched.
</P>
<P>
   Vander Molen bought the house from the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development. The sect, led by a prison convict,
has taken over at least seven Valley houses since early spring.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors say the sect members forced their way into Vander
Molen's house with a crowbar Wednesday night and began moving
furniture in. When neighbors called police to the scene, the sect
members flashed a copy of a bogus deed to the house.
</P>
<P>
   Police at that time took the deed at face value, but one member
of the sect was arrested on an unrelated warrant.
</P>
<P>
   Vander Molen bought the house from HUD in January. She had not
moved in yet because it was, until a few weeks ago, being
renovated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a violation of my rights _ it's harassment!'' Vander
Molen said. ``This is absolutely ludicrous.''
</P>
<P>
   With the help of friends and family, Vander Molen said she
planned to stay in the house with a loaded weapon until she can
move her possessions in and be certain nobody will try to take it
over again.
</P>
<P>
   Located in the heart of Apache Junction with a splendid view of
the Superstition Mountains, the house is at least the seventh in
the Phoenix area that members of Regency House Church have tried to
claim as their own.
</P>
<P>
   In every case, sect members identify a vacant government-owned
house, record phony ownership claims with the Maricopa or Pinal
County recorders' offices, then break in and move in.
</P>
<P>
   In Vander Molen's case, a phony deed was filed with the Pinal
County recorder on June 23, claiming the property belonged to
Regency House. The sect apparently was unaware that the house had
been bought months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The signature on the fake deed, ``Jason Corey Bullard,''
appeared to have been signed and initialed by another sect member,
James Smithart, acting on Bullard's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Smithart said he was representing Bullard on the matter, but
otherwise declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   The deed assigned the property to a sect member named Annette
Long, who police said was one of the two people sent packing
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Vander Molen's was the first house targeted by the sect that
belonged to a private homeowner. In all other cases, the houses
were in the hands of government agencies awaiting resale after
government-insured loans were foreclosed.
</P>
<P>
   While sect members voluntarily dropped their claims to two
houses when challenged, HUD had to seek eviction orders from the
Maricopa County Superior Court in four cases because Mesa police
considered the matter a legal dispute and would not force sect
members from the homes.
</P>
<P>
   Three eviction orders were carried out two weeks ago when sect
members were forced out by members of the Maricopa County Sheriff's
Office. A fourth eviction case involving a Mesa house now is
wending its way through court.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, HUD officials consider every incident a clear case
of trespassing.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, HUD delivered a letter to Mesa police asking the
department to arrest any sect member who set foot on HUD property
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   If they don't, ``it's going to continue to happen,'' Rebecca
Flanagan, HUD's deputy state coordinator, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Bullard, who uses the title ``reverend'' and claims to lead the
sect, is a convicted con man serving a lengthy fraud sentence at
the Arizona State Prison at Perryville. He claimed in interviews
and court records to be guided by God in claiming the houses in the
sect's name.
</P>
<P>
   Bullard appeared in shackles in Superior Court last Wednesday to
argue against his sect's eviction from a Mesa HUD house, saying the
sect had bought aging federal land patents on the property. A judge
is expected to rule in that case next week.
</P>
<P>
   A few days after that court appearance, Bullard's supporters
tried to occupy another vacant HUD house in Mesa. As they drilled
out the locks, neighbors say, police arrived to run them off and
sent away a moving van full of sect members' possessions.
</P>
<P>
   In Vander Molen's case, sect members moved in Wednesday and on
Thursday tried to transfer to their own names the telephone and
utilities that Vander Molen had hooked up at the house. Fortunately
for Vander Molen, the phone company called her Thursday to find out
whether she approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said `No, not at all, you've got the wrong place,' '' Vander
Molen said. But the phone company told her something shocking: the
call for the switch came from a phone line inside her new house.
</P>
<P>
   With that, Vander Molen raced over to find the sect's ``no
trespassing'' signs posted, the locks changed, sheets on some
windows and someone else's belongings inside. She couldn't confront
sect members because no one was home.

   Vander Molen, her companion and her brother returned Friday
morning. Again, nobody was home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to break back into her house, just to reoccupy it,''
said Tony Deblon, Vander Molen's companion. ``Possession is
nine-tenths of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   They sat inside until after noon, when sect members arrived and
Apache Junction police were called. The sect members told police
and Vander Molen that they had paid for the right to move in,
police and federal investigators are skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   Police are expected to follow up next week, HUD's Flanagan said,
and decide whether the person who broke into Vander Molen's home
Wednesday can be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, federal and county prosecutors will be briefed to
determine whether sect members can be prosecuted for other crimes
related to the filing of the bogus deeds, Flanagan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, this can happen to anyone now, it seems like,''
Flanagan said. &QL;

   UNDATED: Soviets tried again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think as an air force we have appreciated how much
that (the airlift) contributed to winning the Cold War,'' Brower
said.
</P>
<P>
   He credits Maj. Gen. William H. Tunner with getting the airlift
into a routine that was responsible for its success. Tunner oversaw
``the Hump,'' a wartime airlift of supplies to China from India and
Burma over the Himalayas. Keeping the Chinese supplied kept about a
million Japanese occupied, Brower said.
</P>
<P>
   When the Berlin airlift began, the U.S. Air Force had been an
independent branch of the military for a mere nine months. The
airlift demonstrated that air power alone could achieve a military
objective, Brower said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the systems put in place in the two airlifts still
affect air traffic, Brower said, including the aggressive use of
radar for en route air traffic control, separating planes by
altitude and time, and aggressive flight safety programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviets were blindsided by the airlift's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``The original perceptions were we would not be able to sustain
this for very long,'' Brower said. ``The Russians thought we
ultimately would give in, but I think that misunderstands the
American culture and our desire to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen said the Germans knew the importance of the airlift.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what time of the day or night, there would always be
people peering at the airplanes,'' he said. ``The Germans really
understood what was going on, and they really appreciated it.''
</P>
<P>
   The airlift allowed West Berliners to feel that freedom was
within their grasp, and they developed a strong sense of resistance
to Russian involvement and domination, Brower said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Allies had thrown in the towel in Berlin, he said, the
Germans might have reached a different kind of accommodation with
the Soviets. And the world would be a very different place today.

<P>
   BEIJING _ President Clinton was received by Chinese President
Jiang Zemin on Saturday in a military ceremony on Tiananmen Square,
the vast expanse through which modern Chinese history has flowed,
from the declaration of the communist state in 1949 to the crushing
of protest 40 years later.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton stood mute throughout, as is customary at such
arrival ceremonies. Clinton and Jiang then inspected army troops
and reviewed an honor guard on ground that human rights advocates
around the world consider stained with the blood of martyrs.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks later, Clinton referred to the site of the
student-led demonstrations that ended in terror and bloodshed on
June 3 and 4, 1989, when Chinese troops center mowed down hundreds
of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all of our agreements we still disagree about the meaning
of what happened then. I believe, and the American people believe,
that the use of force and the tragic loss of lives _ was wrong. I
believe, and the American people believe, that freedom of speech,
association, and religion are, as recognized by the U.N. Charter,
the right of people everywhere and should be protected by their
governments,'' Clinton said after his meeting with Jiang.
</P>
<P>
   He did not abandon the human rights issue, but went on to say:
``We have developed a relationship of openness and candor. When we
differ, as we do from time to time, we speak openly and candidly.
It is well known that the principal area of our difference in
recent years is over questions of human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of the joint news conference was harmonious and
the announcements of a series of agreements including a pledge to
redirect the nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles now aimed at each
other's cities.
</P>
<P>
   The step is largely symbolic, because such weapons can be
changed back in a matter of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang also agreed that China would ``actively study'' joining
the Missile Technology Control Regime, an international agreement
governing the sale of certain missiles and missile technology.
China has resisted the pact because missile exports are a key
money-maker for the military. No timetable was set for China's
actually joining the regime.
</P>
<P>
   The two countries also announced an agreement on a joint
statement on the nuclear arms race now under way in South Asia,
including pledges not to export to India or Pakistan any missiles,
missile equipment or materials capable of delivering nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement covers only medium- and long-range missiles,
however, not battlefield rockets or antitank weapons, a U.S.
official involved in the summit talks said.
</P>
<P>
   China has also agreed to permit inspections of Chinese sites
receiving high-technology equipment from the United States to
assure that it is being put to its intended use and not diverted
for military purposes.
</P>
<P>
   This provision has gained increased importance in recent weeks
with disclosures that China may have used commercial satellites for
military communications, and earlier revelations that computers
supposedly for industrial applications had been diverted to
military installations.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no concrete progress on a number of American human
rights concerns, including the treatment of Tibet and an accounting
for hundreds of political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. official said he was hopeful that signs of progress on
rights might come in the weeks and months after Clinton leaves
China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes things are not announced at the summit, but happen
afterward,'' this official said.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders also agreed to expand the Peace Corps presence here
and to work toward new cooperation on legal reforms, environmental
programs and a new clean energy project to reduce the emissions of
coal-burning power plants.
</P>
<P>
   The summit results amount to a ``pretty substantial package,''
the official said. But many of the military and nonproliferation
items were expected and represented at best incremental steps.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has defended his appearance before the Great Hall of the
People on the edge of Tiananmen Square as the expected behavior of
a state visitor to China.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stood stiffly as the People's Liberation Army band
played ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' and an evocative 21-gun
cannonade rang out across the square. The gunfire continued through
the playing of the Chinese national anthem, ``March of the
Volunteers.''
</P>
<P>
   As the two presidents finished reviewing the troops, they turned
and walked along a red carpet toward the steps of the Great Hall of
the People, smiling and chatting. In 13 minutes, the ceremony,
which stirred such memories and generated such controversy, was
over.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony came at the start of a one-day summit meeting that
has already been marred by the detention and harassment of several
Chinese political dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute forced Clinton and his senior aides into a defensive
crouch and threatened to undermine China's central goal of the
summit _ a portrait of a ``new China'' of greater economic and
personal freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's appearance on the square Saturday morning dramatized
China's struggle between memory and forgetting.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese leadership hopes to consign to history the events of
June 1989, when indelible images of blood-letting in the streets
and of a lone protester standing before a column of tanks were
broadcast around the world. The events are the subject of a
continuing dispute in China, even at high levels of the party.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the party's Central Committee, Zhao Ziyang, who
has been under house arrest since he was ousted as Communist Party
chief at the time of the Tiananmen incident, challenged the
nation's leaders to admit that the incident was reprehensible as
well as an immense political blunder.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, harshly criticized in the United States for lending his
prestige to Beijing's leaders by attending the ceremony, hopes that
his presence here will force the world to remember that bloody
night.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the White House sharply criticized Beijing for the
harassment of dissidents on the first day of Clinton's state visit,
calling the detentions ``thoroughly unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton did not take steps to impose any punishment or
withhold any favors in response.
</P>
<P>
   Using unusually harsh language, National Security Adviser Samuel
Berger said the Chinese internal security apparatus was ``doing
what comes naturally'' by harassing outspoken opponents of the
government who officials fear might embarrass Beijing during the
president's visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not debris to be swept up for a visitor,'' Berger
said at a briefing for reporters Friday in Xian, before the
presidential entourage flew to Beijing for the summit meeting. ``We
certainly will not accept this.''
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups reported that four dissidents were detained
in two Chinese cities and one removed from Xian in the hours before
Clinton's arrival Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   China demonstrated little concern about the detentions, denying
that anyone had actually been ``arrested'' and offering U.S.
diplomats no explanation for their actions. Chinese authorities
routinely round up dissidents and other potential troublemakers
before important events.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese authorities added to the friction Friday night by
impeding two Asian-American White House staff members who were
trying to load the president's luggage aboard Air Force One at
Xian's airport.
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Mike McCurry attributed the incident
to ``over-eager'' Chinese security officials who were not expecting
to find Asians in the presidential party.
</P>
<P>
   The incident was resolved in a few minutes and the stewards were
allowed to board the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Berger tried to explain Beijing's crackdown on dissidents as a
remnant of its police-state past, a preference for order over
political freedom. He said the repression was diminishing, if
slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is changing, but there are still forces that are pulling
the other direction, that are resisting,'' Berger said. ``I think
China's human rights record is terrible. I think China is an
authoritarian nation, as I've said before. I think there's been
some progress in human rights, but it has been not nearly enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the area of public dissent, they are still totally
unacceptable. I don't think this is directed at President Clinton.
The fact that it happens generally in connection with these kinds
of visits, it is not appropriate, it is not necessary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Clinton said he found reports of the
detentions ``disturbing,'' but gave no indication that he would
change his approach to China in response. ``I think it makes the
case, it makes it all the more important that we continue to work
with the Chinese and engage them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jendrzejczyk, director of Human Rights Watch Asia, said the
administration's unwillingness to respond with more than words was
a sign that the White House was ``desperate not to offend the
Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration is walking on eggshells, determined to
demonstrate that this visit represents a major breakthrough in
relations,'' Jendrzejczyk said. ``The Chinese are being tough. They
know their bottom line, and the administration seems willing to
accommodate them at any cost.''
</P>
<P>
   He called on the president to signal his displeasure by
withholding something the Chinese want, such as the planned visit
to the United States later this year by Prime Minister Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
   But Berger said the United States planned nothing beyond verbal
protests. He said it would be against U.S. interests to impose any
punishment or withhold any agreements as a result of the police
action. And he offered a partial excuse for the Chinese action,
saying it was not as severe as previous roundups of dissidents
before the arrival of important foreign visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their instinct _ the instinct of some at least _ is to let
their desire for order overwhelm their ability to permit
expression,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the White House was defending the Tiananmen Square
appearance and the overall value of the summit meeting to
U.S.-Chinese relations, there appeared to be little Chinese
movement on issues the United States considers central to the
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has been pressing for China to permit the live,
nationwide broadcast of Clinton's Monday speech, in which the
president is expected to deliver his strongest message on human
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing has resisted, and White House officials said Saturday
that it appeared the speech would be seen everywhere in the world
but China.
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, even the most ardent fans barely got a
glimpse of the ceremony. The central area of Tiananmen Square
itself was swept clean of any spectators, leaving only a retinue of
security guards and plainclothes officers. Chinese spectators were
kept on the north side of the square by the entrance to the
Forbidden City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't see anything,'' said Wang Jie, 32, a shoemaker.
``It would have been better to watch TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang's colleague Li Changping, said most Chinese have warm
feelings for Clinton and wanted to see him. ``We got up at 3 in the
morning to come here,'' said Li. ``We like Clinton a lot.''

HALF A CENTURY AGO, BERLIN AIRLIFT BEGAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEAN BUCHANAN  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Nobody thought it could be done. Not the Americans. Not
the British. Not the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   The task at hand: Deliver enough food, medicine and coal by
plane to keep 2.5 million people alive indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   The result was the Berlin Airlift, one of the great showdowns of
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 tons of goods were delivered on that first day, 50
years ago Friday. And the numbers grew steadily: 70,000 tons
delivered by the end of July 1948, 147,000 tons delivered that
October, 251,000 tons delivered in May 1949.
</P>
<P>
   A 32-cent commemorative postage stamp that marks the 50th
anniversary of the Berlin Airlift was to be issued Friday and on
sale nationwide starting Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It not only was a huge humanitarian effort,'' said retired Air
Force Col. Charles S. Allen of Leavenworth, Kan., an airlift pilot,
``it was the...first time they (Russians) really saw our resolve
that we were not going to let them drive us out of Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   It also established the fledgling Air Force as a vital part of
the U.S. defense system. And it changed the way Americans viewed
Germans, from the hated enemy to oppressed allies.
</P>
<P>
   When World War II ended, the United States, France, Britain and
Soviet Union carved Germany into four sectors. Although Berlin was
in the Soviet sector, the four powers were to share control of the
capital city.
</P>
<P>
   Military traffic on land, rail and water was supposed to be
allowed to move freely from the Allied sectors of Germany to
Berlin. The Allies also had access through three 20-mile-wide air
corridors.
</P>
<P>
   But the Soviets wanted the Allies out. They delayed or blocked
rail and road travel. They interfered in elections. They stripped
Berlin of valuables and sent them into the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   They also printed currency willy-nilly, resulting in rampant
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   When the Allies secretly planned a new currency, the Soviets
decided to starve them into submission. They blocked traffic by
land, by water and by rail into the Western sector of the city.
They cut off electricity except for two hours a day, between 11
p.m. and 1 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Allies, including U.S. President Harry S. Truman, were
determined to maintain their presence in Berlin. The commander of
the U.S. Air Force in Europe, Lt. Gen. Curtis LeMay, promised that
the Air Force could deliver.
</P>
<P>
   Planes were summoned from all over Europe, from Panama, Guam,
Japan and the United States. Within four days, British and American
planes were delivering more than 2 tons of goods daily. The effort
was dubbed Operation Vittles.
</P>
<P>
   Planes landed on the runway at Tempelhof in West Berlin every
eight minutes. At the airlift's peak, planes would land every three
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the Allies intended to sustain only the occupation
forces, said Col. John Brower, a professor at the Air War College
at Maxwell Air Force Base, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have difficulty saying no to someone in need,'' he
said. ``It was very difficult for us to turn that aside.''
</P>
<P>
   Pilots were pulled from behind desks to fly in the airlift. When
it became clear that more pilots were needed, a field duplicating
the conditions in Berlin was laid out in Great Falls, Mont. Fighter
pilots and pilots with no troop carrier or multi-engine experience
were sent to Great Falls for training, and then to Germany, said
Allen, 75.
</P>
<P>
   Ground crews were assembled and sent to Germany, too. The
airlift was hard on the planes, and the mechanics and crews
``worked like dogs'' to keep the planes operational, Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody was on a 24-hour-a-day schedule. The Allies were
trying to supply the Berliners with enough to eat, and soon they
would be needing lots of coal so they wouldn't freeze during the
winter. A proposal to drop coal in bags from the air was discarded
after the coal turned to dust in test runs.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the airlift assumed the characteristics of an
assembly line. Planes took off one after the other, day and night.
Pilots had only one opportunity to land in West Berlin. If they
missed their approach they had to take their cargo back to West
Germany. Otherwise, the traffic stacked up over Berlin and precious
time was lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was organized,'' recalled Allen, who joined the
airlift in April 1949. ``Planes were packed nose to tail. They'd
unload the first plane, the line would move up. When you stopped
and the door flew open, immediately there was a crew of German
unloaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Their goal was to be back in the air in 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh M. Tosone, 68, of Gladstone, Mo., was one of the people
working to keep the planes flying. He arrived in Germany in
September 1948.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just 18 years old, and I was convinced the Russians were
coming over the next hill,'' he said. ``They issued us rifles...but
to show what kind of confidence they had in us, they didn't give us
any bullets.''
</P>
<P>
   Tosone was stationed at Rhein-Main, one of the bases in the
American zone. The other was Wiesbaden.
</P>
<P>
   His squadron took engines from the planes used in the airlift to
Mobile, Ala., to be overhauled, and then flew them back to
Frankfurt to be reinstalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a lot of worldly ideas about what we were
doing,'' said Tosone, who later became a physicist and worked for
Boeing in Wichita, Kan., for 35 years. ``It was just a matter of
getting your job done every day...just keeping the airplanes going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure some of us thought it was a world-shaking effort, but
as a young person I just considered it a job.''
</P>
<P>
   It took nearly a year, but in the end, the Soviets conceded,
allowing rail, truck and ship traffic to resume to the western
sectors of the city. The airlift continued until September 1949 as
the Allies stockpiled supplies in case the Soviets tried again.

PLAN TO END OF CAR TAX PUTS KANSAS GOVERNOR, LEGISLATOR ON SAME
PAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Kansas tax-relief crusader Phill Kline can be excused
if he happens to be feeling a bit smug these days.
</P>
<P>
   When Gov. Bill Graves last week made scrapping the property tax
on cars by 2003 an early centerpiece of his re-election campaign,
the guv validated the Johnson County legislator's unrelenting
crusade to cut Kansas taxpayers an even break. It's been a long and
often lonely struggle for the Republican legislator from Shawnee,
but it's not politics alone that makes for strange bedfellows.
</P>
<P>
   Election year politics, it would seem, make for really weird
bedfellows _ at least in Kansas this year. Who would've thunk, for
instance, that the governor would have ever become as enthusiastic
a champion of tax relief as the House Taxation Committee chairman
with whom he has often been at odds on tax-cut initiatives?
</P>
<P>
   Kline was the House point man in the campaign to lighten the
onerous car-tax burden. Taxpayers in Johnson and Wyandotte counties
who had been in the habit of writing substantial checks for car
taxes in years past no doubt have noticed more recently how nice it
is to write smaller car-tax checks with each passing year. Now the
prospect of not writing any such checks is something that will make
taxpayers sit up and take notice anew.
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities are certainly something perceptive politicians
notice. Graves, it's safe to say, probably has been impressed with
how Virginia's new governor rode the promise of car-tax relief to
victory as a long-shot social conservative candidate last year.
Interestingly enough, Graves is facing a primary challenge from
former Republican Party Chairman David Miller, who also carries the
social conservative label.
</P>
<P>
   As the executive director of the Kansas Taxpayers Network, Karl
Peterjohn, recently pointed out, it's remarkable how far Graves has
come on this tax issue. Not only has the governor frequently
clashed with Kline over aggressive tax-cutting proposals, but
Democratic gubernatorial candidate Jim Slattery also was
characterized as fiscally irresponsible when he proposed modest
car-tax relief during his 1994 contest with Graves.
</P>
<P>
   Now Graves not only is calling for elimination of the property
tax on cars at an estimated revenue cost of $259 million over five
years, but is making noises about cutting other taxes.
</P>
<P>
   It probably wouldn't do, however, for Kline and his fellow
tax-relief crusaders to view this as Topeka's version of anybody
getting struck blind on the road to Damascus. Kline, et al, have
every reason to be gratified by the governor's willingness to
concede the need to return more of the burgeoning revenue windfall
to the taxpayers. However, it's a good bet there are no born-again
tax-cutters out there.
</P>
<P>
   Political leaders who have grown accustomed to perceiving tax
revenue as something needed more by government than by the people
paying the taxes are usually set in their ways. No matter how much
tax-cut talk is bandied about during the coming election campaign,
the only numbers that should matter are how much government
spending is increasing relative to real personal income growth.
</P>
<P>
   Any spending number that surpasses the gains of working folk is
unacceptable. Thus, it will be the never-ending challenge of Kline
and other champions of overburdened taxpayers to keep the scales
balanced between the state's fiscal interests and the economic
interests of taxpayers.

CAMPANIS IS EULOGIZED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE 
and MARC J. SPEARS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Al Campanis was remembered Wednesday as the
architect for a generation of Los Angeles Dodgers success and far
from the perception of a racially insensitive baseball executive
who was fired by the club in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers general manager Tom Lasorda eulogized Campanis, who died
last Sunday at 81 of complications from a heart attack, as ``the
smartest baseball man I ever knew, who did not see color in his
players. He never cared if you were black or white or Latin, just
if you could play.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda, who now has the position Campanis held from 1968 to
1987 before being forced to resign for unflattering comments about
African-American players on ABC's ``Nightline,'' addressed an
audience of about 300 in Fullerton, where both men lived.
</P>
<P>
   Pallbearers included broadcaster Vin Scully, Hall of Fame
pitcher Sandy Koufax and former Cincinnati and Detroit manager
Sparky Anderson, now an Angels broadcaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to sit for hours and talk about the '70s when the Reds
and Dodgers used to battle it out every year,'' Anderson said.
``Later, he would drive to Anaheim to visit and we would talk about
the game. Once he asked: `Is this all we know?' I told him, `Hey,
we aren't Harvard professors.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Schweppe, longtime Dodgers farm director, said the Columbia
University-educated Campanis often upset rival teams with his
unusual savvy of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was taken as arrogance by many people,'' Schweppe said.
``But it really was just the supreme confidence and intelligence of
a man who had an unusual knack for the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his many skills was player evaluation, learned from Hall
of Fame executive Branch Rickey in the mid-1940s and passed on to
Lasorda, who was elected into the Hall of Fame last year.
</P>
<P>
   It was Rickey who signed Jackie Robinson to become baseball's
first African-American player in 1947. Campanis and Robinson were
roommates the year before at the Dodgers' top minor-league club and
remained close friends until Robinson died in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad that Al will be remembered more for what he did that
one night on television than all his years in baseball,'' said
Koufax, who was signed by Campanis in 1955. ``Of all the things he
was, that is something he was not.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Russell, who played his entire career for Campanis, made
his first public appearance since last Sunday when he was fired as
the Dodgers' manager but refused to comment. Former Dodgers GM Fred
Claire was also in attendance, as was new Dodgers manager Glenn
Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   Former Dodgers owner Peter O'Malley, who fired Campanis in 1987,
was in Ireland and did not attend the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw talk: The Dodgers are reportedly interested in trading for
Cincinnati Reds closer Jeff Shaw, who picked up his 20th save
Friday _ more than the Dodgers have as a team.
</P>
<P>
   Reports are that Shaw would like to stay in Cincinnati since he
resides just an hour's drive north in Washington Court, Ohio. He
makes $650,000 this season, $2.8 million in each of the next three
seasons and could make more than $3 million in 2000 if he ranks in
the top three for the league's top reliever award.
</P>
<P>
   Etc: Right fielder Gary Sheffield sat out of the game because of
an upset stomach.... Catcher Charles Johnson was given the night
off.... Right-hander Darren Hall retired all four batters he faced
with one strikeout during a rehabilitation start for Single-A San
Bernardino at Lake Elsinore on Thursday night. Hall, on the
disabled list since April 8 with a torn rotator cuff, is 0-0 with a
3.00 ERA in six rehab starts. He may return to the Dodgers after
his next start.... Lance Parrish was named the manager at Double-A
San Antonio to replace Ron Roenicke, who accepted the managerial
position at Triple-A Albuquerque.

EDITORIAL: CHINA'S RUDE RECEPTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
(updates to incorporate Clinton' remarks)  (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, June 27:
</P>
<P>
   The ceremonial part of President Clinton's welcome may be fit
for an emperor, but other aspects of the Chinese government's
behavior have looked like calculated insults. By detaining several
democracy advocates during the president's stop in Xian and
imposing heavy surveillance on other democrats in Beijing, Chinese
leaders have seriously embarrassed Clinton. He must respond
personally, publicly and bluntly.
</P>
<P>
   As Beijing well knows, Clinton took considerable political risks
to go through with this trip. By making his presence a pretext for
picking up political activists, China's leaders demonstrated
indifference to his efforts on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton politely but clearly deplored the detentions before
leaving Xian on Friday. His national security adviser, Samuel
Berger, spoke more sharply, warning that ``people are not debris to
be swept up for a visitor.''
</P>
<P>
   But now, after China's disdainful rebuff of a diplomatic protest
from Ambassador James Sasser, Clinton must forcefully register his
unhappiness with his Chinese hosts over the incident. His remarks
about human rights and the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre earlier
Saturda morning were welcome. But he needs to say more about
China's current behavior as the political heart of the visit
unfolds in Beijing this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeping potential demonstrators away from international
visitors is a sadly familiar Chinese practice. But that repressive
tradition is not something a U.S. president can accept without
public protest when it is waved in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   President Jiang Zemin wanted Clinton to visit China this year as
a symbol of improving ties between Beijing and Washington. But real
improvement is retarded when China flaunts its methods of stifling
dissent during this visit.
</P>
<P>
   Responding strongly to these detentions is not simply about
damage control in Washington. It is an integral part of building a
healthier relationship with China, which should be Clinton's main
goal on this visit. Such a relationship cannot be built on the
premise that Beijing is free to deliver angry diatribes whenever it
feels offended but that Washington must always be deferentially
polite.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of double standard invites dangerous diplomatic
misunderstandings. It also builds resentment among the American
people, who are already uneasy over charges of Chinese interference
in the 1996 presidential campaign and lax U.S. supervision of
Chinese satellite contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's preference was to avoid any appearance of rudeness on
this trip. But Beijing's lack of courtesy compels him to raise his
voice.

ANGELS FALL TO PADRES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Anaheim Angels first baseman Cecil Fielder walked
into the visiting clubhouse at Qualcomm Stadium on Friday
afternoon, took a look at the uniform jerseys hanging in the locker
stalls and proclaimed: ``Oh man, they're tired.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego Padres promoted their game with the Angels on
Friday as ``Retro Night.'' Both wore uniforms from the 1978 season,
disco music played during batting practice and between innings, and
even a few Padres players got into it by wearing giant Afro wigs
before the game.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing uglier than the Padres' brown-and-yellow
jerseys was the way the Angels played in a 6-3 loss before 40,621.
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Jason Dickson (8-5) wasn't nearly as sharp as he
had been of late, his seven-game winning streak coming to an end.
But a more notable problem was the Angels defense.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Dave Hollins and second baseman Justin Baughman
made errors, and just as glaring were the mental errors made by
Hollins and Fielder in the Padres' decisive three-run sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Fielder let a sacrifice bunt attempt by Kevin Brown roll past
him, hoping it would go foul. It didn't, and Brown was safe at
first with a single.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the inning, the Padres had the bases loaded with one
out when Greg Vaughn hit a one-hopper to Hollins. Ed Giovanola
started the play on third base, but broke back to the bag thinking
Hollins might have caught the ball on the fly.
</P>
<P>
   Hollins, though, didn't throw home. He looked at first, then
eventually tagged out Tony Gwynn going from second to third,
allowing Giovanola to score.
</P>
<P>
   It was a far cry from the way the Angels had been playing. They
had won 21 of their previous 25 before Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Angels and Padres had winning records in 1978, both
teams would prefer to look ahead, not back. The Padres went into
Friday's game tied with Atlanta for the best record in the National
League, and the Angels are second only to the Yankees in the
American League.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of both teams would be getting ahead of themselves to start
dreaming of an I-5 World Series, but this would have to do for now.
</P>
<P>
   Brown had an Angel on his side in the early innings, but not one
from Anaheim. Brown had seven strikeouts through the first four
innings, all seven coming on called-third strikes by homeplate
umpire Angel Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Brown (9-3) finished with nine strikeouts in six innings to get
the win. After Dan Miceli walked two Angels on eight straight
pitches with one out in the eighth, Trevor Hoffman came on for his
24th save and 32nd straight dating to last year. Hoffman struck out
three in 12/3 scoreless innings.
</P>
<P>
   Through three innings, Brown was nearly perfect, yielding only a
first-inning single to Hollins. But in the fourth, Hollins got
things started with a double.
</P>
<P>
   After a walk to Jim Edmonds, Fielder hit one halfway to Anaheim.
One pitch after Brown brushed him back, Fielder hit his 13th home
run of the year into the second deck in left-center field for a 3-0
Angels lead. The distance was estimated at 443 feet.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 18th home run to reach the second deck in the
stadium's history, the eighth by a Padres opponent, and the first
opponent to do so since the Dodgers' Mike Piazza did it on Sept.
22, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres cut into the Angels lead quickly, however. Ken
Caminiti hit Dickson's first pitch in the bottom of the fourth
inning over the fence in left for is 11th homer of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the same inning extended by a Hollins throwing error at
third, Brown singled home Wally Joyner to cut the Angels' lead to
3-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres tied it in the fifth inning on Vaughn's two-out RBI
double, a drive that Edmonds got a glove on before crashing into
the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Also: Todd Greene has consulted with doctors, talked to manager
Terry Collins and general manager Bill Bavasi and finally he's made
up his mind.
</P>
<P>
   No surgery _ at least, not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Greene, who has what trainer Ned Bergert called ``internal
impingement caused by instability in the right shoulder,'' will
begin a rehabilitation program immediately and has set a target
date of Aug.1. If the shoulder doesn't show significant improvement
by then, Greene likely will have the surgery and still have enough
time to recover in time for spring training next season.
</P>
<P>
   But Greene, after visiting Drs. Lewis Yocum, Frank Jobe and
James Andrews, is convinced he can come back this season. Not as a
catcher, but to play first base, the outfield or DH.
</P>
<P>
   ``My intent is to help this team win games this year,'' Greene
said. ``However I can do that, I'm willing to do.''

PERKINS THINKING ONE MORE SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Sam Perkins moved slowly but with a bounce in his step
while walking into Garfield High School on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   And if the Sonic forward has his way, that is exactly how the
summer will go _ slowly, only with a basketball to bounce at the
end.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins, who turned 37 on June 14, is at a crossroads in his
14-year career. Conventional wisdom suggests that his age plus the
Sonics' youth movement might equal Perkins' retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, says Big Smooth.
</P>
<P>
   ``One more year is probably left in me to be an effective
player,'' Perkins said during a break from Friday's Seafirst
Jammin' Hoops Camp in Seattle's Central Area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still had fun (last season),'' Perkins said. ``If I don't
have fun, then it's time to go. But it's so irrational for me to
make a decision about retiring right now. More than likely I'll
probably come back and play.''
</P>
<P>
   But where will Perkins end up?
</P>
<P>
   Perkins becomes a free agent Wednesday. He made more than $3
million last season. The Sonics are not likely to pay that much for
a veteran on the down side of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins averaged 7.2 points per game last season but shot 41
percent _ the second lowest shooting percentage of his career. He
snared just three rebounds a game and appeared a step slow on
defense. But Perkins remains one of the league's better 3-point
shooters.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever he lands, it is likely Perkins will have to accept a
one-year contract for the league minimum _ roughly $500,000. Jerome
Kersey was in a similar situation last year when he signed with the
Sonics for $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's worth it, I can do that,'' Perkins said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Perkins wonders if the Sonics will offer him a contract
at all. They have expressed a strong desire to have a younger
roster.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, when free agency begins, so will an NBA lockout. Teams
will not be permitted to pursue any free agents without a
collective bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But Perkins planned to meet and greet new coach Paul Westphal on
Friday. Perkins figured he would leave with an idea of the team's
plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy Seattle,'' said Perkins, ``but I'm not going to be on
their door step. If I'm not in their plans, I'm not in their plans.
There are so many options for them and me to take into
consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   Perkins said he would prefer to play with an NBA contender. He
also will consider location and his role as a backup. Even though
it is widely believed that he is linked with ex-Sonic George Karl,
Perkins doesn't mind that Westphal was hired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised they fired George,'' Perkins said. ``It's
sad that we just didn't (win) together. That's the only down side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, Coach had his favorites. Among those were Nate
(McMillan) and Detlef (Schrempf). He had a married-with-children
relationship with Gary (Payton). . . . I just laughed with him
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Perkins chuckled after mentioning that he played against
Westphal his rookie season _ 1984-85.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he's a cool guy,'' Perkins said of Westphal.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins drew the same reaction from more than 1,600 kids he
interacted with at the basketball camp. Perkins, teammate Dale
Ellis, the the Seattle Reign's Kate Starbird and former NBA great
Bill Walton participated during the second day of the three-day
camp.
</P>
<P>
   The free program began in 1990 and will visit 24 cities this
summer. Seafirst uses NBA stars such as Perkins to stress the
importance of education and staying away from drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm moving slow because it's early in the morning,'' Perkins
said. ``I was up until 2 o'clock in the morning making plans (for
the summer events around Seattle). But it's cool. I'm having a good
summer.''

DODGERS BEAT PIRATES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARC J. SPEARS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There was no shocking news to report Friday in the
Los Angeles Dodgers' never-ending off-the-field soap opera. Nor was
there any lackluster play or blown lead that has been the norm
recently.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, the Dodgers quietly took care of business by
simply doing something they have dreamed of for some time _ playing
good, drama-free baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the rejuvenated pitching of Chan Ho Park, the Dodgers won
just their second game in their past seven outings with a 5-2
victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates in front of a sold-out
Fireworks Night crowd of 52,934 at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It was just last Sunday when Park endured the worst outing of
his major-league career that really got rolling in 1996. The
right-hander allowed 10 runs on eight hits in 51/3 innings during a
loss at Colorado that was also the last game for manager Bill
Russell and general manager Fred Claire.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Park's tough outing, new Dodgers pitching coach Charlie
Hough didn't try to make any drastic changes with him. Instead, the
former knuckleballer told the right-hander to relax, forget about
Colorado and stop putting ``Opening Day pressure'' on himself.
</P>
<P>
   In 62/3 innings, Park (6-5) did just that as he allowed two runs
on 10 hits, one walk and struck out four for the win. Park, who
threw 120 pitches, won for just the second time in his last eight
outings. He also allowed the fewest number of runs since giving up
one in his last win against Oakland on June 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't easy,'' Park said. ``It was good win for me, us and
pitching staff.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning, Park retired his first two batters before
hitting Jason Kendall with a pitch. Kevin Young followed with RBI
single that gave Pittsburgh a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the second, Park loaded the bases with no outs. However, a
fielder's choice, a groundout and a popout helped him survive the
ugly jam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chan Ho battled the whole game,'' Dodgers manager Glenn
Hoffman said. ``The second inning was key. He turned it up a notch
and kept us in the ballgame. The bullpen did a tremendous job
tonight and defense was the key. When we needed to make the big
plays, we did.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We just couldn't get the big hit,'' said Pirates manager Gene
Lamont. ``Especially in the second inning when we could of blown it
open.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers rookie Paul Konerko started the season sluggishly at the
plate, but recently he has been able to take some of the rust off
his bat. Such was evident when he had his sixth hit in his last 11
at-bats with a two-run home run over the left field fence off
Pittsburgh starter Esteban Loaiza in the second inning to give the
Dodgers a 2-1 advantage. The home run off the 1-0, no-out pitch was
Konerko's fourth of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way I hit,'' Konerko said. ``I go up there and
take balls and try to swing at good pitches. I'm just trying to do
my best.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman said: ``Konerko is coming along well. I have all the
confidence in the world in him. People don't remember that he is
still young, too. I'm very pleased with him.''
</P>
<P>
   With the scored tied in the fourth, Dodgers regained the lead
3-2 when Konerko scored on a one-out RBI single by fellow rookie
Adrian Beltre. In the fifth, the Dodgers pushed their advantage to
4-2 when Eric Young scored on a one-out sacrifice fly by Eric
Karros.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman showed confidence in Park by leaving him in to bat in
the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Park retired his first two batters in the seventh. But after
hitting the next batter and allowing a single, Park was lifted for
struggling reliever Scott Radinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Radinsky, who had blown five of his last six save opportunities,
was welcomed with boos and didn't help matters as he loaded the
bases by hitting pinch-hitter Mark Smith. Radinsky, however, struck
out Aramis Ramirez to ruin the Pirates' second chance of
capitalizing on a bases-loaded situation.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, catcher Tom Prince earned just his second RBI of
the season with a two-out RBI single that scored Trenidad Hubbard
and gave the Dodgers a 5-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Antonio Osuna finished the game by striking out Guillen
to earn just his fourth save of the season.

<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. _ As Frank Sinatra's widow watched in
horror, her longtime friend George Schlatter tried to fend off four
muggers who attacked them in their exclusive Beverly Hills
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The thugs ended up taking $17,000 in jewelry and cash from
Sinatra, her son, Robert Marx, and Schlatter and his wife, Jolene,

other TV shows proved to be too much for the two muggers, so their
two accomplices jumped in.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw a flying karate kick,'' Schlatter recalled in an
interview Friday. ``Fortunately, he needed some more lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grabbed his foot and twisted it and flipped him. Then his
friend came over and tried to kick me,'' he said. ``They both wound
up on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Schlatter was not injured in the attack, but acquaintances of
recently widowed Barbara Sinatra said she was shaken by the
incident. On Friday, a van from a lock-shop company drove into the
estate of the Sinatra home.
</P>
<P>
   Marx was hit on the head but not seriously injured, Schlatter
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very, very lucky,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Police were searching for the four men, who fled in a car they
believe to be a two-door, new black Honda with paper plates from
the Norm Reeves dealership. Detectives focused on trying to track
down the car, but the dealership said it was not missing any Hondas
and sells more than 1,000 a week.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the men were described as African-Americans in their
20s. Their heights ranged from 5 feet 6 inches to 6 feet, their
weights from 140 to 180 pounds. Three wore dark clothing, with two
wearing caps. The fourth man, who drove the getaway car, was not
described.
</P>
<P>
   One mugger left with a souvenir of the encounter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to have some explaining to do to someone in the
'hood about how he got that on his cheek,'' Schlatter said.
</P>
<P>
   No weapons were shown during the ordeal, according to police,
although Variety columnist Army Archerd reported the muggers
threatened to ``spray'' the four victims.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives declined to provide details about what was stolen.
Schlatter also would not comment, but he said the fight broke out
after the muggers demanded ``watches and jewelry.''
</P>
<P>
   It all began while the four friends were taking a twilight
stroll back to Sinatra's sprawling mansion on North Foothill Road
after eating dinner nearby at the Schlatters' home on Robert Lane.
</P>
<P>
   Just six blocks away, two robberies had occurred June 16 on
Sinatra's street. In one, the robbers took $200 worth of property
and fled, and in the second, $105 worth of belongings was stolen,
according to police crime reports.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the four said they were not worried about being mugged.
After all, they were in the tony Doheny Estates section of Beverly
Hills, one of the most affluent and famous cities in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Schlatter said he doesn't believe the thieves knew they were
targeting Frank Sinatra's wife and himself, a renowned producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very affluent area of Beverly Hills,'' Schlatter
said. ``We now have to live defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Detectives also believe it was a random attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have robberies from time to time,'' said Lt. Al
Munoz-Flores of the Beverly Hills Police Department. ``The trend
has been that our crime is going down.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said Beverly Hills averages 10 robberies a month, and
that the number fell 19 percent between 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Les Bronte also believes the attack was isolated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our crime rate is very low. But it should be low. We are a
safe community. I walk the streets at night and I don't even have a
dog,'' Bronte said.
</P>
<P>
   Though he expressed concern for the victims, the mayor to the
home of the rich and famous said the high-profile incident is not
cause for alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, FBI and state statistics show robberies within the
34,000-population Beverly Hills have declined from five years ago.
In 1997, there were 116 robberies reported, down by 22 incidents
from 1996. In 1993, there were 281 robberies in the city; 189 in
1994 and 196 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, a private security firm patrols the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors and city officials reacted with shock about the
muggings in the peaceful neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one saw anything. Not a thing. It's very odd,'' said Kathie
Durazo, a personal assistant to a couple that lives where the
muggings occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can she have been mugged?'' Sidney Katz asked in
disbelief. Katz said he walks on Doheny Road almost everyday for
exercise and has always felt safe. ``I'm surprised that it happened
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Schlatter said he plans to use the attack to help others. He
wants to make a video to teach people self-defense and ways to
avoid being accosted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This experience is happening to more and more people,'' he
said, ``so we do have to take this seriously. We do have to focus
on education.''

<P>
   BEIJING _ President Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin,
on live television, engaged in an extraordinary, and at times
heated, public debate Saturday over China's human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint appearance after a two-hour summit meeting, the two
presidents announced a sheaf of agreements, but offered sharply
different interpretations of the Tiananmen Square protests nine
years ago that ended in the deaths of hundreds of pro-democracy
demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that China was ``wrong'' to violently crush the
demonstrations and said that China's political and economic
development _ and its acceptance by the rest of the world _ were
threatened by an excessive search for internal order.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang retorted that Clinton was viewing events in China from the
luxury of America's wealth and long history of social stability.
</P>
<P>
   And he said of the Tiananmen ``disturbances'' of June 1989,
``the Chinese people have long drawn its own conclusion. Had the
Chinese government not taken the resolute measures, we could not
have enjoyed the stability we are enjoying today.''
</P>
<P>
   Jiang said that China is a socialist country with a different
political and social system than the United States. And he
pointedly noted, ``No country's human rights situation is
perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese president offered Clinton a chance to respond, which
he eagerly seized. Clinton said that he understood China's desire
for social stability because of centuries of upheaval, disruption
and anarchy. But he said that advanced societies accepted a
compromise between freedom and order.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a lot of personal freedom, some people may abuse
it,'' Clinton said. ``But if you are so afraid of personal freedom
because of the abuse, and if you limit personal freedom too much,
you pay an even greater price.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate followed a welcoming ceremony on Tiananmen Square,
the vast expanse through which modern Chinese history has flowed,
from the declaration of the communist state in 1949 to the crushing
of protest 40 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton defended his appearance before the Great Hall
of the People on the edge of Tiananmen Square as the expected
behavior of a state visitor to China, in his remarks later, the
president referred to the site of the 1989 student-led
demonstrations that ended in terror and bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all of our agreements we still disagree about the meaning
of what happened then. I believe, and the American people believe,
that the use of force and the tragic loss of lives _ was wrong. I
believe, and the American people believe, that freedom of speech,
association, and religion are, as recognized by the U.N. Charter,
the right of people everywhere and should be protected by their
governments,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   He did not abandon the human rights issue, but went on to say:
``We have developed a relationship of openness and candor. When we
differ, as we do from time to time, we speak openly and candidly.
It is well known that the principal area of our difference in
recent years is over questions of human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond human rights, much of the remainder of the joint news
conference in the Great Hall was devoted to the announcements of a
series of agreements including a pledge to redirect the
nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles now aimed at each other's cities.
</P>
<P>
   The step is largely symbolic, because such weapons can be
changed back in a matter of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang also agreed that China would ``actively study'' joining
the Missile Technology Control Regime, an international agreement
governing the sale of certain missiles and missile technology.
China has resisted the pact because missile exports are a key
money-maker for the military. No timetable was set for China's
actually joining the regime.
</P>
<P>
   The two countries also announced an agreement on a joint
statement on the nuclear arms race now under way in South Asia,
including pledges not to export to India or Pakistan any missiles,
missile equipment or materials capable of delivering nuclear
weapons. The agreement covers only medium- and long-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
   China has also agreed to permit inspections of Chinese sites
receiving high-technology equipment from the United States to
assure that it is being put to its intended use and not diverted
for military purposes.
</P>
<P>
   This provision has gained increased importance in recent weeks
with disclosures that China may have used commercial satellites for
military communications, and earlier revelations that computers
supposedly for industrial applications had been diverted to
military installations.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no concrete progress on a number of U.S. human
rights concerns, including the treatment of Tibet and an accounting
for hundreds of political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. official involved in the summit talks said he was hopeful
that signs of progress on rights might come in the weeks and months
after Clinton leaves China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes things are not announced at the summit, but happen
afterward,'' this official said.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders also agreed to expand the Peace Corps presence here
and to work toward new cooperation on legal reforms, environmental
programs and a new clean-energy project to reduce the emissions of
coal-burning power plants.
</P>
<P>
   The summit results amount to a ``pretty substantial package,''
the official said. But many of the military and nonproliferation
items were expected and represented at best incremental steps.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At Saturday morning's ceremonies Clinton stood stiffly as the
People's Liberation Army band played ``The Star-Spangled Banner''
and an evocative 21-gun cannonade rang out across the square. The
gunfire continued through the playing of the Chinese national
anthem, ``March of the Volunteers.''
</P>
<P>
   When the two presidents finished reviewing the troops, they
turned and walked along a red carpet toward the steps of the Great
Hall of the People, smiling and chatting. In 13 minutes, the
ceremony, which stirred such memories and generated such
controversy, was over.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony came at the start of a one-day summit meeting that
has already been marred by the detention and harassment of several
Chinese political dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute forced the president and his senior aides into a
defensive crouch and threatened to undermine China's central goal
of the summit _ a portrait of a ``new China'' of greater economic
and personal freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's appearance on the square this morning dramatized this
nation's struggle between memory and forgetting.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese leadership hopes to consign to history the events of
the spring of 1989, when indelible images of blood-letting in the
streets and of a lone protester standing before a column of tanks
were broadcast around the world. The events are the subject of a
continuing dispute in China, even at high levels of the party.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the party's Central Committee, Zhao Ziyang, who
has been under house arrest since he was ousted as Communist Party
chief at the time of Tiananmen, challenged the nation's leaders to
admit that the incident was reprehensible as well as an immense
political blunder.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, harshly criticized in the United States for lending his
prestige to Beijing's leaders by attending the ceremony, hopes that
his presence here will force the world to remember that bloody
night.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the White House sharply criticized Beijing for the
harassment of dissidents on the first day of Clinton's state visit,
calling the detentions ``thoroughly unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   But the president did not take steps to impose any punishment or
withhold any favors in response.
</P>
<P>
   Using unusually harsh language, National Security Adviser Samuel
Berger said the Chinese internal security apparatus was ``doing
what comes naturally'' by harassing outspoken opponents of the
government who officials fear might embarrass Beijing during the
president's visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not debris to be swept up for a visitor,'' Berger
said at a briefing for reporters Friday in Xian, before the
presidential entourage flew to Beijing for the summit meeting. ``We
certainly will not accept this.''
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups reported that four dissidents were detained
in two Chinese cities and one removed from Xian in the hours before
Clinton's arrival Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   China demonstrated little concern about the detentions, denying
that anyone had actually been ``arrested'' and offering U.S.
diplomats no explanation for their actions. Chinese authorities
routinely round up dissidents and other potential troublemakers
before important events.
</P>
<P>
   Berger tried to explain Beijing's crackdown on dissidents as a
remnant of its police-state past, a preference for order over
political freedom. He said the repression was diminishing, if
slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is changing, but there are still forces that are pulling
the other direction, that are resisting,'' Berger said. ``I think
China's human rights record is terrible. I think China is an
authoritarian nation, as I've said before. I think there's been
some progress in human rights, but it has been not nearly enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the area of public dissent, they are still totally
unacceptable. I don't think this is directed at President Clinton.
The fact that it happens generally in connection with these kinds
of visits, it is not appropriate, it is not necessary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Clinton said he found reports of the
detentions ``disturbing,'' but gave no indication that he would
change his approach to China in response. ``I think it makes the
case, it makes it all the more important that we continue to work
with the Chinese and engage them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jendrzejczyk, director of Human Rights Watch Asia, said the
administration's unwillingness to respond with more than words was
a sign that the White House was ``desperate not to offend the
Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House has been pressing for China to permit the live,
nationwide broadcast of Clinton's Monday speech, in which the
president is expected to deliver his strongest message on human
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing has resisted, and White House officials said Friday that
it appeared possible that the speech would be seen everywhere but
China.
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, at Saturday's ceremony, even the most ardent
fans barely got a glimpse of the ceremony. The central area of
Tiananmen Square itself was swept clean of any spectators, who were
kept on the north side of the square by the entrance to the
Forbidden City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't see anything,'' said Wang Jie, 32, a shoemaker.
``It would have been better to watch TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang's colleague, Li Changping, said most Chinese have warm
feelings for Clinton and wanted to see him. ``We got up at 3 in the
morning to come here,'' said Li. ``We like Clinton a lot.''

DODGERS BEAT PIRATES
</HEADLINE>

By MARC J. SPEARS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was no shocking news to report Friday in the Dodgers'
never-ending off-the-field soap opera. Nor was there any lackluster
play or blown lead that has been the norm recently.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, the Dodgers took care of business by simply doing
something they have dreamed of for some time. Playing good,
drama-free baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Behind a rejuvenated and gutsy pitching performance from Chan Ho
Park, the Dodgers won just their second game in their past seven
outings with a 5-2 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates in front of
a sellout fireworks night crowd of 52,934 at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, 4-1 against the Pirates this season, earned their
largest margin of victory since a 5-0 triumph at Colorado almost a
week-and-a-half ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was just last Sunday that Park endured the worst outing of
his major-league career that really got rolling in 1996. The
right-hander allowed 10 runs on eight hits in 51/3 innings during a
loss at Colorado, which was the last game for manager Bill Russell
and general manager Fred Claire.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Park's tough outing, new Dodgers pitching coach Charlie
Hough didn't try to make any drastic changes with his pupil.
Instead, the former knuckleballer told Park to relax, forget about
Colorado and stop putting ``Opening Day pressure'' on himself.
</P>
<P>
   In 62/3 innings, Park (6-5) did just that as he allowed two runs
on 10 hits, one walk and struck out four. Park, who threw 120
pitches, won for just the second time in his past eight outings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't easy,'' Park said. ``It was a good win for me, us
and the pitching staff.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first, Kevin Young hit a two-out RBI single off Park that
gave Pittsburgh a 1-0 lead. In the second, Park loaded the bases
with no outs. However, a fielder's choice, a groundout and a popout
by the Pirates helped him survive the jam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chan Ho battled the whole game,'' Dodgers manager Glenn
Hoffman said. ``The second inning was key. He turned it up a notch
and kept us in the ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We just couldn't get the big hit,' Pirates manager Gene Lamont
said. ``Especially in the second inning when we could've blown it
open.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Konerko got his sixth hit in his past 11 at-bats with a
two-run homer over the left-field fence off Pittsburgh starter
Esteban Loaiza (5-4) in the second inning. The 22-year-old rookie's
fourth home run of the season gave the Dodgers a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way I hit,'' said Konerko, 2 for 2 with two runs.
``I go up there and take balls and try to swing at good pitches.
I'm just trying to do my best.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman said: ``Konerko is coming along well. I have all the
confidence in the world in him. People don't remember that he is
still young, too.''
</P>
<P>
   With the scored tied in the fourth, Dodgers regained the lead
3-2 when Konerko scored on a one-out RBI single by fellow rookie
Adrian Beltre. In the fifth, the Dodgers pushed their advantage to
4-2 when Eric Young scored on a one-out sacrifice fly from Eric
Karros.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring the first two batters in the seventh, Park hit a
batter and gave up a single. Hoffman opted for struggling reliever
Scott Radinsky, who had blown five of his past six save
opportunities and was welcomed with boos.
</P>
<P>
   Radinsky didn't help matters as he loaded the bases by hitting
pinch-hitter Mark Smith. But the Simi Valley High graduate struck
out Aramis Ramirez to ruin the Pirates' second chance of
capitalizing on a bases-loaded situation.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, Tom Prince earned just his second RBI of the
season with a two-out RBI double that pushed the Dodgers ahead 5-2
lead. Reliever Antonio Osuna finished the game by striking out
Guillen to earn just his fourth save of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bullpen did a tremendous job tonight and defense was the
key,'' Hoffman said. ``When we needed to make the big plays, we
did.''

ANGELS FALL TO PADRES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Anaheim Angels first baseman Cecil Fielder walked
into the visiting clubhouse at Qualcomm Stadium on Friday
afternoon, took a look at the uniform jerseys hanging in the locker
stalls and proclaimed: ``Oh man, they're tired.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego Padres promoted their game with the Angels as
``Retro Night.'' Both teams wore uniforms from the 1978 season,
disco music played during batting practice and between innings, and
even a few Padres players wore giant Afro wigs before the game.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing uglier than the Padres' brown-and-mustard
yellow jerseys was the way the Angels played in a 6-3 loss before
40,621.
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Jason Dickson (8-5) wasn't nearly as sharp as he
had been of late, his seven-game winning streak coming to an end.
But a more notable problem was the Angels' defense.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Dave Hollins and second baseman Justin Baughman
made errors, and just as glaring were the mental errors made by
Hollins and Fielder in the Padres' decisive three-run sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to say in the month of June we have not played a game
like that, where we gave away runs,'' Angels manager Terry Collins
said. ``Jason pitched fine, we just didn't make plays and that's
what we've done all month.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fateful sixth inning, Fielder let a sacrifice bunt
attempt by Padres starting pitcher Kevin Brown roll past him,
hoping it would go foul. It didn't, and Brown was safe at first
with a single.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the ball hit something and kicked back,'' Fielder
said. ``It was going foul.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the inning, the Padres had the bases loaded with one
out when Greg Vaughn hit a one-hopper to Hollins. Ed Giovanola,
running at third base, broke back to the bag thinking Hollins
caught the ball on the fly.
</P>
<P>
   Hollins, though, didn't throw home. He hesitated, looked at
second, then eventually tagged out Tony Gwynn coming to third from
second, allowing Giovanola to score.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew he didn't catch it in the air, and he went to throw to
second but Tony was in the way,'' Collins said in defense of his
third baseman. ``It was too late to go to third for the double
play. It was one of those freaky things.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you face Kevin Brown, you can't give away too many runs.
</P>
<P>
   It was a far cry from the way the Angels had been playing. They
had won 21 of their previous 25 before Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Brown (9-3) struck out nine in seven innings and Trevor Hoffman
pitched 12/3 innings for his 24th save in 24 opportunities this
season, and 32nd in a row overall.
</P>
<P>
   Brown had an Angel on his side in the early innings, but not one
from Anaheim. Brown had seven strikeouts through the first four
innings, all seven coming on called-third strikes by homeplate
umpire Angel Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' only runs of the game came in the fourth inning when
Fielder hit one halfway to Anaheim. One pitch after Brown brushed
him back, Fielder hit his 13th home run of the year into the second
deck in left-center field for a 3-0 lead. The distance was
estimated at 443 feet.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 18th home run to reach the second deck in the
stadium's history, the eighth by a Padres opponent, and the first
opponent to do so since the Dodgers' Mike Piazza did it on Sept.
22, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Also:!off! Todd Greene has consulted with doctors, talked
to manager Terry Collins and general manager Bill Bavasi and
finally he's made up his mind.
</P>
<P>
   No surgery _ at least, not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Greene, who has what trainer Ned Bergert called ``internal
impingement caused by instability in the right shoulder,'' will
begin a rehabilitation program immediately and has set a target
date of Aug.1. If the shoulder doesn't show significant improvement
by then, Greene likely will have the surgery and still have enough
time to recover in time for spring training next season.
</P>
<P>
   But Greene, after visiting Drs. Lewis Yocum, Frank Jobe and
James Andrews, is convinced he can come back this season. Not as a
catcher, but to play first base, the outfield or DH.
</P>
<P>
   ``My intent is to help this team win games this year,'' Greene
said. ``However I can do that, I'm willing to do.'' &UR; !end! &LR;  &QL;

GRIFFEY HURTS HAMSTRING AFTER HITTING 31ST HOMER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Ken Griffey Jr., gave the Mariners a lead in the third
inning Friday night with his 31st home run. And he kept them ahead
in the sixth inning with a sensational catch in left-center.
</P>
<P>
   But the pain Griffey felt in the back of his left leg while
making the highlight-reel grab soon became another giveaway night
by the Mariner bullpen. Minutes after Griffey disappeared into the
dugout, a one-run lead became a four-run deficit and eventually a
13-8 loss to the expansion Arizona Diamondbacks before 47,902 fans
at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Devon White parked a bases-loaded homer off Bob Wells to cap a
five-run sixth inning and send the stumbling, bumbling Mariners to
their 14th loss in the past 20 games.
</P>
<P>
   And that's with Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they have him in the lineup Saturday night depends on
how quickly he recovers from what is believed to be torn scar
tissue near his hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might have caught a break,'' manager Lou Piniella said.
``At first, we thought he pulled the hamstring. But that might not
be the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Rick Griffin said he believes the scar tissue around the
muscle Griffey pulled last season might have been torn, and that
wouldn't be nearly as troublesome as a hamstring pull. ``But we'll
have to wait and see,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey experienced the discomfort when he chased down a
400-foot drive hit by Jay Bell in the Diamondbacks' decisive sixth
inning. Griffey stretched for the ball, grabbing it in the webbing
of his glove in deep left-center. It deprived Bell of an extra-base
hit that would have scored David Dellucci from first base with the
tying run.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a heckuva play. I didn't think he had a chance of
catching it,'' Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey made a strong throw back to the infield, but then walked
in, motioning for Griffin to meet him along the way.
</P>
<P>
   That became the focal point on a night Piniella threw a couple
of new wrinkles into the lineup. He moved first baseman David Segui
to left field and inserted designated hitter Edgar Martinez at
first base.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mariners lost their 10th game this season when scoring
at least seven runs.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Griffey's homer that capped a three-run third inning and
gave Seattle a 3-1 lead, Dan Wilson emerged from a prolonged
hitting slump with three hits, including a three-run homer in the
sixth that put the Mariners in front 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   Starter Bill Swift got to the sixth, but not impressively.
</P>
<P>
   The right-handed sinkerball specialist, who leads the staff with
seven wins, served up four of the Diamondbacks' team-record five
home runs. Olympia's Travis Lee homered in his first two at-bats,
driving in four runs, White hit the first of his two off Swift and
Andy Fox also knocked a Swift pitch into the seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was falling behind in the count and trying to throw too
hard,'' said Swift, who had given up just six homers in 722/3
previous innings. ``Pitches that were supposed to be down and away
were up and over the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for Greg McCarthy, who pitched a scoreless inning, none
of the pitchers Piniella used had much success against the top of
Arizona's lineup. Fox, White, Lee and Matt Williams went a
collective 10-for-17, scored nine runs, hit five home runs and
drove in 12 runs.
</P>
<P>
   As for the lineup changes, Segui had a quiet night in left field
in his first start at the position since May 25, 1995 when he was
with Montreal. He becomes the 56th player to play alongside Griffey
since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez had a busy night.
</P>
<P>
   He had six putouts, four assists and started two double plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Edgar really played a great game at first base,'' Piniella
said.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Rodriguez didn't have one of his best.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariner shortstop twice muffed throws from second baseman
Joey Cora that could have started inning-ending double plays. The
first one was especially costly, prolonging the third inning long
enough for Lee to deliver a three-run homer.

CLINTON AND JIANG DEBATE HUMAN RIGHTS, TIBET, TAIWAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ President Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin
turned a joint news conference Saturday into a dazzling debate
about Tiananmen Square, Taiwan and Tibet that was broadcast to
millions of Chinese TV viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials sought to portray the
cheerfully spirited debate as a historic breakthrough because it
signaled Jiang's willingness to allow his countrymen to hear
conflicting views on human rights and the 1989 Tiananmen Square
massacre.
</P>
<P>
   During their only scheduled working session of Clinton's
nine-day visit, the two leaders agreed to cease aiming long-range
missiles armed with nuclear weapons at each other's cities in a
largely symbolic gesture that could be reversed in a matter of
minutes by U.S. and Chinese military forces.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen of China's 18 long-range missiles are aimed at U.S.
cities. U.S. officials declined to specify how many of the nation's
6,000 warheads are aimed at targets in China.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders' 70 minutes of press conference ping pong came after
Clinton participated in the most controversial moment of his visit
thus far _ the welcoming ceremonies at Tiananmen Square where
Chinese authorities crushed a pro-democracy movement nine years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton received a thundering 21-gun salute on a plaza
overlooking Tiananmen Square, the 98-acre expanse in the heart of
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   In his first public remarks after the ceremony, Clinton urged
Chinese authorities to get ``on the right side of history'' by
apologizing for the crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe _ and the American people believe _ that the use of
force and the tragic loss of life was wrong,'' Clinton declared.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang calmly countered: ``Had the Chinese government not taken
the resolute measures then, we could not have enjoyed the stability
that we are enjoying today.''
</P>
<P>
   But the leaders' give-and-take went both ways.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang challenged Clinton to publicly proclaim what has been
promised only by lower-level U.S. officials: The U.S. commitment to
a so-called ``three ~~`No's' policy'' toward Taiwan, an island of
21.8 million people about 100 miles off the Chinese coast.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Three No's'' are: No independence for Taiwan, no U.N.
membership for Taiwan and no diplomatic maneuver that would offer
separate U.S. recognition to China and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing considers Taiwan to be part of China.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton declined to publicly offer Jiang the reassurances that
he sought. Clinton said that he had ``reaffirmed our long-standing
one-China policy'' during his private discussions. But Clinton left
it to National Security Adviser Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger to publicly
restate the U.S. commitment to shun separate recognition for
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is between a rock and a hard place on
the explosive issue. A federal law _ the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act
_ requires the United States to defend Taiwan against any armed
attack by Chinese forces as though Taiwan were an independent
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sent a U.S. Navy armada into the straits between Taiwan
and China in 1996 when Chinese forces aimed intimidating missile
tests toward Taiwan during the province's election.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. support for Taiwan remains a flash point in U.S. domestic
politics. The House voted 411 to 0 in early June for a measure
urging Clinton to call on Beijing to renounce the use of force
against Taiwan. Jiang vowed peaceful negotiations to absorb Taiwan
into China.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Jiang treated Chinese viewers to a diplomatic minuet
on the independent-minded province of Tibet and the return of the
region's exiled spiritual leader, Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang said that his government would welcome the return of the
Tibetan leader as long as the saffron robed leader ``can publicly
make the statement and a commitment that Tibet is an inalienable
part of China.'' Clinton endorsed the pre-condition and urged Jiang
to meet with the Tibetan leader.
</P>
<P>
   Both Clinton and Jiang seemed to relish their easy ability to
play off each other to make their points to audiences in both
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Citing their nations' ongoing dispute over human rights _
including Chinese authorities' arrest and release of at least three
political dissidents during Clinton's visit _ Clinton told viewers:
``You can see that neither one of us (is) shy about being strong
about how we believe about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Jiang injected that each leader is ``a strong defender'' of his
nation's interests, ``but despite that, we still can have very
friendly exchanges of views and discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Jiang politely agreed to disagree over the two
nations' conflicting policies on the use of nuclear weapons as they
agreed to detarget their missile arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has long rejected ruling out first use of
nuclear weapons. China pledges only to use its arsenal of nuclear
weapons in retaliation for a nuclear attack that has already taken
place.
</P>
<P>
   Without being asked, Jiang used the free-wheeling format to
reject allegations that the Chinese government funneled campaign
contributions to candidates in the 1996 U.S. federal elections in
an effort to win influence in the United States. The allegations
are ``sheer fabrications,'' Jiang said.

</P>
<P>
   Li Zhaoxing, China's ambassador to the United States, told White
House officials that the broadcast on state-run television may have
reached 500 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials surprised Clinton with the decision to
broadcast the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   President George Bush took part in a nationally televised
question-and-answer session during a visit here in February 1989.
But Chinese authorities declined to translate sensitive remarks
into Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials offered President Ronald Reagan the
opportunity to address the nation in a pre-taped address in 1984.
But the officials then aired only selected portions of Reagan's
address.

   CHINA-SUMMIT (Beijing) _ The U.S.-China summit ended Saturday
night with a formal state dinner after an extraordinary live
televised exchange between President Clinton and Chinese President
Jiang Zemin over human rights, Tibet and China's path to the
future. By John M. Broder.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-TV-BROADCAST (Beijing) _ What is perhaps most remarkable
about Saturday's exchange between President Clinton and President

human rights to Tibet, was broadcast live all over China, via China
Central Television-1, the government's main television station. By

</P>
<P>
   CHINA-ASSESS (Beijing) _ President Bill Clinton handed China's
leaders a gift simply by coming here, giving them global respect
despite the sharp criticism of his China policy back home.
Saturday, with the surprise decision to televise an extended news
conference and debate on human rights, China may have returned the
favor. By Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-REACT (Beijing) _ As evening fell on Yonganli Street, a

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some big health insurers are putting a new squeeze on
doctors, sharply cutting the fees they pay and imposing strict new
rules that physicians say can undermine patient care. Angry
doctors, in turn, are fighting back with lawsuits and complaints to
state regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Many traditional health plans and physician networks have for
several years been relatively generous to doctors, giving them
something close to the ``usual and customary fees'' in a community.
But payments are increasingly being based on the lowest available
fees, sometimes those found in bargain-rate managed-care plans. And
all-or-nothing contracts often require doctors to accept patients
in all of an insurer's plans, not just the higher-paying ones.
</P>
<P>
   If doctors balk at any restrictions, they can be blackballed
from plans, losing access to thousands of patients. And even though
insurers have the final say over whether a treatment is necessary,
many contracts now hold the doctors, not the health plans, liable
in malpractice suits over denial of care, which have soared lately.
On top of that, doctors must frequently give up the right to sue
the health plan if it refuses to pay for a service.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, doctors say, care can suffer as physicians become
more reluctant to fight health plans on behalf of their patients.
Also, thousands of patients have had to find new doctors after
their old ones were dropped from plans or resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most aggressive in clamping down, some doctors say, is
Aetna U.S. Healthcare, one of the United States' biggest health
insurers, with 13.7 million customers. Blue Cross plans in at least
seven states and some local units of United Healthcare and Cigna
Healthcare have also reduced fees and in many cases imposed harsher
rules.
</P>
<P>
   This is not, of course, the first time insurers have turned the
screws. Earlier rounds of cutting, as the nation moved to managed
care, involved limits on hospital stays and other treatments and
cuts in payments to doctors. In recent years, though, many
insurers, striving to persuade doctors to join their health
networks, held back on any further cuts and maintained fairly
attractive fees and generous terms for doctors and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   But insurers soon felt caught between big employers that
resisted rate increases and doctors and hospitals that joined
forces to strengthen their bargaining power. The latest cuts, along
with efforts to raise rates significantly for some employers, can
be seen as an effort to try to restore profits by regaining
control.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers also defend the fee cuts by saying their costs are
being forced up by new technologies, like surgery with tiny
instruments; by new drugs, like Viagra, and by aging patients with
more needs. And demands for treatment are growing, they say, based
on expectations inflated by advertising.
</P>
<P>
   And in some places, insurers have more leverage against doctors
because mergers among plans have increased the pressure on doctors
to participate in the surviving ones.
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association said it had reviewed 100
contracts in the last year and increasingly found provisions that
gave insurers the right to dictate fees and lower them at will
instead of working them out with doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna Inc. started to insist on tougher restrictions last year,
doctors said, adopting the approach of U.S. Healthcare, which Aetna
bought in 1996. They said Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in some
cities, including Philadelphia, Atlanta, San Francisco and
Providence, R.I., had also adopted many hard-hitting provisions,
departing from a long history of cooperation with doctors and
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Newton, an ophthalmologist in Manhattan said Aetna
had cut its payment for an initial eye exam last year to $78 from
$150. The payment for some follow-up exams dropped to $27 from $70.
Patients paid $10 a visit. He said the total did not even cover
overhead. Nevertheless, Aetna said it had contracts with 400
Manhattan ophthalmologists.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laura Popper, a New York pediatrician, left Oxford Health
Plans after the HMO cut fees sharply last year. The fee for a
well-baby visit was set at $47; her regular fee is $90. Dr. Popper
said she showed the Oxford contract to her lawyer, who said, ``Why
would any doctor sign this?'' Oxford did not respond to a request
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Patients are often unwitting victims, many doctors say. The
frustrations of doctors often come out, ``like it or not, in
negative feelings about members of that plan,'' said Marla Durban
Hirsch, a health-care lawyer who is editor of a newsletter for
managed-care negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   With new contracts that vastly increase the power of insurers,
``physicians are very reluctant to advocate on behalf of their
patients,'' said Dr. Lee McCormick, a family practitioner in
Pittsburgh, who is president of the Pennsylvania Medical Society.
They fear that ``if they argue too much,'' he said, ``they will get
a letter from the health plan that says, `Dear Doctor, we don't
need you any more.'''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, thousands of patients have been forced to find new
doctors after their old ones were dropped from their health plans
or resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, mergers are vastly increasing the bargaining power of
big insurers. In Dallas, for example, recent mergers, plus one in
the works, will eliminate four of the nine biggest health plans,
which cover 80 percent of the patients. And after a merger in
western Pennsylvania, Highmark Blue Cross and Blue Shield provides
coverage for more than 60 percent of the population of Pittsburgh
and 29 surrounding counties.
</P>
<P>
   Many doctors say they cannot reject contract terms for fear of
being dropped by plans that control hundreds of their patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physicians tell me they cannot negotiate with the insurer,''
said Dr. William Mahood, a gastroenterologist in Abington, Pa., and
a trustee of the American Medical Association. ``Some have told me
that when they considered dropping out'' of a low-paying
Philadelphia Blue Cross HMO, ``they were afraid to do that because
they would not be able to participate in the other Blue Cross
programs.''

</P>
<P>
   A few independent-minded groups, typically affiliated with a
strong local hospital system, have resigned from networks. They
pulled out of several Blue Cross plans and units of at least two
big national insurers, Aetna U.S. Healthcare and United Healthcare.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, the Healthsource unit of Cigna Healthcare
gave physicians six days' notice of cuts that averaged about 20
percent, said Dr. Robert Bilbro, a Raleigh internist. He said that
since Cigna bought Healthsource last year, it has become ``the
lowest-paying HMO in the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross companies in California, Georgia, Illinois, New
Jersey and Pennsylvania, among others, have lowered physician fees
in the last year. Rhode Island doctors are fighting a Blue Cross
demand for an arrangement that would lower fees to match the lowest
paid by any insurer in the state.
</P>
<P>
   In California, Blue Cross cut fees in four of the last five
years. Payment for a hip replacement, for example, dropped nearly
50 percent since 1994, to $2,380 from $4,602. The state medical
association filed a class action arguing that the reductions were
unfair and violated contracts. One big California hospital and
doctor group, Sutter Health, withdrew from the Blue Cross network
until the company reversed its latest rate reductions.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Coulter, a spokeswoman for California Blue Cross, made
no bones about the fee cuts. ``Of course we are pushing harder for
profit margins,'' she said. ``We have to have reserves to pay the
claims.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors also complained that some insurers had changed payment
systems and refused to give them new lists of payments. The Georgia
Medical Association argued in a complaint filed in state court that
Blue Cross and Blue Shield had violated Georgia contract law by
unilaterally changing the basis for calculating payments.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a discount from ``usual and customary fees,'' the
complaint said, payments are now based on what doctors actually
receive _ including low managed-care fees.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Blue Cross denied the contention and said the medical
association could not sue, because only individual doctors were
parties to the contract.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the New York state Legislature approved a
measure requiring insurers to disclose payment terms and the basis
on which they were developed.
</P>
<P>
   Medical associations in Florida and Texas complained to state
insurance officials when Aetna tried to impose its restrictive
contract.
</P>
<P>
   When doctors in Florida, Ohio and other states asked
professional societies for help, Aetna canceled meetings with state
and local medical associations, arguing that the groups were barred
by antitrust laws from even discussing the complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association seized the issue and publicized
the Aetna case, urging doctors to rebuff insurance-company demands.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna's chief executive, Richard Huber, responded with a letter
to the association's president, Dr. Thomas Reardon. Huber said the
company's limits on coverage were ``determined by the employers who
purchase our products.'' He added, ``Without these limitations, our
products would be unaffordable.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Brock, a senior vice president of the Baylor University
Medical System, said 1,100 doctors affiliated with Baylor had
declined to sign with Aetna. He said they objected to a requirement
that Baylor doctors join all Aetna plans and accept the same fees
in both HMOs and more loosely managed networks.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor, oddly enough, sits on both sides of the table. The
hospital-and-doctor system supports the doctors' revolt even though
it owns a minority slice of Aetna's Texas business. Aetna will have
more than 1.2 million subscribers in northern Texas after it
completes a purchase of NYLCare health plans from New York Life
Insurance Co.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Arthur Leibowitz, Aetna's chief medical officer, said the
doctors' complaints were just part of ``business discussions'' on
the way to ``successful'' contracts with 200,000 physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we unilaterally change a provision of a contract,''
Leibowitz said, ``if you don't like them, you can quit, or, better,
negotiate with us.''
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, several doctor groups in the Advocate Health System
broke off with United Healthcare in the last year, said Dr. Lee
Sacks, executive vice president of Advocate.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Illinois Blue Cross and Blue Shield cut fees
``significantly'' this spring in its preferred-provider networks,
Sacks said, the plans ``were still paying 15 percent to 20 percent
more than United.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kaveh Safavi, a United Healthcare vice president in Chicago,
said United ran on ``a fixed total budget,'' which is linked to
what employers pay. That means that the fee ``has to go down,'' he
said. ``It's not just a United Healthcare issue,'' he added.
``That's the medical system.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The U.S.-China summit meeting ended Saturday night
with a formal state dinner after an extraordinary live televised
exchange between President Clinton and Jiang Zemin, the Chinese
president, over human rights, Tibet and China's path to the future.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders announced a number of agreements, including a
pledge to retarget their ballistic missiles quickly so that neither
side is aiming nuclear weapons at the other.
</P>
<P>
   The two nations also announced modest progress toward China's
adherence to an international missile proliferation agreement and
steps toward China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   But the drama of the meeting came in a remarkable 70-minute news
conference, carried live on nationwide Chinese television, in which
the two presidents differed sharply on the nature of personal
freedom, the role of the state and the meaning of the Tiananmen
Square demonstrations that were violently suppressed by the Chinese
government in June 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Some U.S. officials expressed concern after Saturday's exchange
that the Chinese might not permit the broadcast of Clinton's speech
on Monday to students at Beijing University, the rhetorical
centerpiece of the president's nine-day visit to China. But they
said the president had made his point in unvarnished terms before a
potentially huge audience.
</P>
<P>
   However, because few Chinese knew that the news conference would
be televised live, it was not clear how many had actually seen it,
and there was no mention of the debate in later television or print
coverage of the trip in China.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting represented a significant evolution in the often
tense relationship between the two powers and was the first time a
foreign leader had squarely confronted the painful legacy of
Tiananmen Square on Chinese soil _ and on Chinese airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials were jubilant because the news conference allowed
Clinton to speak without filters to the Chinese people of American
concerns about China's human-rights record.
</P>
<P>
   It was also, in their view, a powerful response to critics in
the United States who said that Clinton should not have rewarded
the Chinese government with a high-profile summit meeting even as
its communist leaders continued to suppress political speech and
the free exercise of religion.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said that they did not signal to the Chinese in
advance of the news conference that Clinton planned to speak out
forcefully on the Tiananmen Square tragedy. They said they did not
want to force Jiang into a defensive posture, or, more important,
cause the Chinese to pull the plug on the live broadcast of the
event.
</P>
<P>
   The spirited exchange recalled earlier confrontations between
top U.S. officials and communist leaders, including the ``kitchen
debate'' between Richard Nixon, then vice president, and Nikita
Krushchev, and the summit meeting between Ronald Reagan and Mikhail
Gorbachev. It also echoed a similar debate on human rights when
Jiang was in Washington last October. But at Saturday's news
conference, the back and forth was more forceful and animated.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton flatly told the Chinese leader that his government had
been ``wrong'' to use force to end the peaceful demonstrations of
the spring of 1989 and that broad personal freedom and political
expression were the price of admission to the world community of
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all of our agreements, we still disagree about the meaning
of what happened then,'' Clinton said in his opening statement,
referring to the violent crackdown on Tiananmen Square the night of
June 3-4, 1989, that left hundreds of protesters dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe, and the American people believe, that the use of
force and the tragic loss of life was wrong,'' the president said
as a stone-faced Jiang looked on. ``I believe, and the American
people believe, that freedom of speech, association and religion
are, as recognized by the U.N. Charter, the right of people
everywhere and should be protected by their governments.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked by a reporter about Clinton's remarks on the lessons
of Tiananmen Square, Jiang appeared ready with an answer. He
defended the use of army tanks and rifles to end what he called the
``disturbances'' of 1989 as essential to maintaining order.
</P>
<P>
   He said the United States and China had different social
systems, ideologies, histories and cultures. ``So it's nothing
strange that we may have some difference of views over some
issues,'' Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With regard to the political disturbances in 1989, the Chinese
people have long drawn a historical conclusion,'' he went on,
becoming more emphatic in his expression and his gestures. ``I have
stated our position that with regard to the political disturbances
in 1989, had the Chinese government not taken the resolute
measures, then we could not have enjoyed the stability that we are
enjoying today.''
</P>
<P>
   He then offered Clinton an opportunity to reply, in what U.S.
officials called a generous political gesture that Clinton eagerly
seized.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that the U.S. system was based on a delicate
balance between personal liberty and central authority, with
liberty the paramount value.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the question for all societies going forward into the 21st
century is: Which is the better gamble?'' Clinton said. ``If you
have a lot of personal freedom, some people may abuse it. But if
you are so afraid of personal freedom because of the abuse, that
you limit people's freedom too much, then you pay, I believe, an
even greater price.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tibet, Clinton urged Jiang to initiate a direct dialogue with
the Dalai Lama, the mountain region's religious leader, in return
for recognition that Tibet is part of China. He also urged Jiang to
respect the ``unique cultural and religious heritage'' of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang replied that, as a communist and an atheist, he found it
``unfortunate'' that Tibet clung to what he called an anachronistic
theocracy.
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that religious freedom was protected in Tibet, as
elsewhere in China, and said that Beijing had invested millions of
dollars in the economic development of Tibet and restoration of
historic shrines.
</P>
<P>
   But he expressed bewilderment that many educated Americans and
Europeans believed in lamaism and blindly supported the Dalai
Lama's calls for greater autonomy.

 BEIJING: greater autonomy.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clinton, permitted the last word at the end of the lengthy news
conference, said: ``Let me say something that will perhaps be
unpopular with everyone. I have spent time with the Dalai Lama. I
believe him to be an honest man, and I believe if he had a
conversation with Jiang, they would like each other very much.''
The audience, both Chinese and American, laughed.
</P>
<P>
   At the state dinner in the Great Hall of the People, the leaders
wore business suits and Hillary Rodham Clinton wore a bright yellow
pantsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In toasting Clinton, Jiang noted that the relationship between
China and the United States had seen ``some twists and turns'' but
was nevertheless moving forward. He acknowledged differences on
some fundamental issues, but added, ``What is important is that the
common interests between the two sides far outweigh their
differences.''
</P>
<P>
   In his toast, Clinton said, ``We Americans appreciate the mutual
respect of our relationship _ a relationship based on cooperation,
candor and recognition of each other's values and traditions.'' He
concluded his toast with the traditional Chinese ``Gan bei!'' or
``Bottoms up!''
</P>
<P>
   The agreements announced Saturday offered no breakthroughs in
U.S.-China relations. Rather, they were incremental steps across a
broad range of issues that U.S. officials said demonstrated the
depth of a growing relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The two nations will work more closely on fighting disease and
environmental health problems, on combating drugs and on clean
energy programs. They will cooperate on legal reforms, including
training of judges and lawyers and the use of the legal system to
ensure the observance of human rights.

   They agreed to work together to reduce and eventually eliminate
the global use of anti-personnel land mines. And they pledged to
jointly press India and Pakistan to walk back from the nuclear
brink by halting all nuclear tests and joining the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this has been quite an extraordinary day in the
evolution of U.S.-China relations,'' said Sandy Berger, the White
House national security adviser. ``This is a summit that produced
substantial results that will make life more secure and improve
lives in other ways for the American people and for the Chinese
people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We also saw today a truly historic press conference that for
the first time witnessed the leader of the United States and the
leader of China discussing and debating a range of issues, but most
particularly human rights, to a live audience across China and the
United States,'' Berger said. ``A president of the United States
and a president of China not only speaking to themselves, not only
speaking to the press, but speaking to their own people and
speaking to each other's people.''

   LA-DEM-CONVEN (Los Angeles) _ Los Angeles is trying to lure the
Democratic National Convention to the city in 2000, but some
question whether L.A.'s strategy is powerful enough to win against
six other cities vying to play convention host. Boston Mayor Thomas
Menino is using gifts of coffee cakes and coffee table books,
arranged for fireworks to be set off inside his city's Fleet
Center, and made sure hockey great Bobby Orr offered the Democrats
drinks at a Red Sox game. The stakes are enormous. The winner will
host 30,000 guests who will generate an estimated $150million in
revenue. The 15,000 media members will give the host city's
attractions unparalleled publicity. By Rick Orlov.

CLINTON'S WORDS FIND WAY TO BEIJING'S ALLEYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: CHINA-SUMMIT, CHINA-TV-BROADCAST, CHINA-ASSESS,
CHINA-HILLARY) 
(lb) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ As evening fell on Yonganli Street, a crowded alleyway
of small shops on the east side of town, word was filtering from
one doorway to the next about what had been on television at noon:
In a nationally televised news conference, President Clinton had
come out and said that the Chinese government's use of military
force to suppress the 1989 Tiananmen demonstrations had been tragic
and wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it true?'' said Huang Shubin, who sat behind a desk of
messy papers at a machine repair shop, smoking a cigarette. ``A
friend called and said it was on TV, but I didn't know whether to
believe him.''
</P>
<P>
   Since there was no advance warning by the Chinese news
organizations about the broadcast, and since Clinton's frankest
comments were omitted from later news accounts, only people who
happened to be watching television at noon on a Saturday actually
saw Clinton make his comments. Yet with content like that, there
was no question about the word getting out.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other residents of Beijing, Huang was genuinely
surprised that the authorities allowed Clinton's remarks to be
broadcast on the air. Until now, references to the massacre by the
state-run news organizations have been rare, and have uniformly
supported the ``resolute measures'' taken in the 1989 crackdown, in
which hundreds of civilians are believed to have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   In ordinary conversation, though, people in Beijing speak quite
freely about politics. Several shopkeepers and customers here said
without hesitation that they agreed with Clinton's assessment. The
massacre may still be a potent political issue, but nine years have
passed, and some of the emotion that once swirled through any
discussion of the events of June 4, 1989, has inevitably
dissipated.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, the government's decision to allow the broadcast of
Clinton's comments, like so many other changes in policy here,
seems to reflect a situation where policy is catching up with the
reality already out on the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Openly talking about it, that's progress,'' said Jin Hongli,
who stopped to buy a magazine at an outdoor stall. ``People talk
about it among themselves all the time. The government should
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Like several other evening strollers and shoppers on Yonganli
Street, Jin said he thought it was unlikely that the government
would change its official position on the 1989 events. Reversing
the official verdict would be a major political event, with
potentially enormous consequences, and though such a reversal is
widely considered inevitable, predicting the timing is difficult.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A few doors down the alley, Li Hong expressed some displeasure
about Clinton's remarks as she waited to have her hair done in a
tiny beauty parlor. Ms. Li, like people in many countries, seemed
to resent hearing her government being reprimanded by a foreigner,
even if she agreed with what he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shouldn't say those things,'' said Ms. Li, a young woman
who described herself as an office worker. ``He's a guest in this
country. He should be a little more polite, and then when he gets
home he can say whatever he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Beijing, seasoned political activists immediately
saw the significance of letting Clinton debate President Jiang
Zemin freely on sensitive issues like the Beijing massacre and
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Live coverage of the press conference enables Chinese people
to better understand the different styles and different political
views of the two countries,'' said Xu Wenli, a veteran dissident
who spent 12 years in prison for publishing a non-official
newspaper during the Democracy Wall period in 1979. ``These remarks
have left a deep impression.''
</P>
<P>
   Xu said that Clinton's public voicing of concern, for the
detention of four dissidents in Xian just before his arrival, would
encourage the authorities to restrict such practices in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will make police in other places learn a lesson, if
encroachment on human rights happens during important international
exchanges,'' Xu said. ``It will become a major diplomatic issue.
The Chinese government should advise police to respect basic rights
of all people, including dissidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang Lingyun, whose son Wang Dan was exiled to the United States
in April, may not be a fully objective viewer, but she said that
she found Clinton's remarks more impressive than Jiang's.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my point of view, what Clinton said was much more
reasonable, at least on the issue of human rights,'' she told
Reuters.

   RIFLE, Colo. _ In this gateway to prime elk hunting country, the
motel is called the Remington, the minimall is called the
Winchester, each street sign carries a silhouette of a rifle and
the town history is titled ``Rifle Shots.''
</P>
<P>
   So in a town with a strong gun culture and where people are
keenly aware of the dangers that guns can pose, it was with alarm
and uneasiness that residents watched on their television sets in
recent months as teen-age boys, from rural towns just like Rifle,
showed up at schoolyard after schoolyard in scattered towns around
the nation, and turned their rifles on unsuspecting classmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what scares me,'' said Roland Klocker, president of the
local sportsmen's club, as shotguns boomed from a skeet range. ``It
could be here. It could be Rifle.'' Mystified by a gun culture gone
awry, he added, ``I just can't get into the heads of those kids.''
</P>
<P>
   In conversations at the town's firing range, gun shop, high
school and video store, residents revealed that they were wrestling
with the schoolyard shootings, an issue that is gripping rural
America this summer.
</P>
<P>
   At Rifle High School, which has 900 students, teachers have
discussed ways to identify potentially threatening students next
fall. In hunter education classes, instructors are tightening
standards, failing teen-agers who seem immature. Many people here
said they favored childproofing guns, either by locking them in
cabinets or by installing trigger locks.
</P>
<P>
   But the schoolyard violence has left the town deeply concerned,
looking for reasons for what has happened and seeking ways to keep
it from happening here.
</P>
<P>
   They offered explanations as diverse as a breakdown of
traditional hunting culture, a modern desensitization to the
consequences of violence and carelessness by adults who store
firearms in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its Western rawhide name, this town of 5,000 people has
a newly suburban overlay. Not far from Rifle, which lies in a
cottonwood valley surrounded by beige mesas dotted with pinyon and
greasewood, an abandoned oil camp has been reincarnated as the
state's largest retirement community.
</P>
<P>
   In the other direction, Aspen beckons with high-paying jobs,
luring migrants here from California. With Rifle's real-estate
values tripling in a decade, the pickup truck tribe shares Railroad
Avenue with families in sport utility vehicles. The hook and bullet
crowd coexists with the Rifle men's play group, an association of
stay-at-home dads.
</P>
<P>
   Although Rifle High School no longer automatically lets students
out for the start of the elk-hunting season, many teen-age boys who
move here feel the pull to go hunting. But hunting-safety
instructors here warn that an adult mentor, either a parent or a
friend, is essential for a teen-ager to learn how to responsibly
handle firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Occasionally, we get these kids, where the parents are
divorced, the mother doesn't hunt, but they want to be cool and
hunt because their peer group does this,'' said Sarah McKenney, a
hunter-safety instructor. ``They come in with weird strips shaved
off their heads, earrings, other body parts pierced. They don't
look like real outdoorsmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are going to be smart-mouthed and disrespectful, I'll
let them coast the whole weekend, then I tell them to come back
next year, when they grow up,'' said Ms. McKenney, who has taught
hunter safety to 1,000 students here in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Many people here place much of the fault for schoolyard
shootings on a breakdown in the rural traditions of teaching
children respect for life and responsibility in the handling of
firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that the tradition has been broken,'' said David
Ebeler, a 25-year-old who recently passed his hunter-safety course,
a requirement for all hunters in Colorado under 50. ``It's a
respect thing. You keep the guns locked up. It's always been that
way in my household, in my parents' household. You don't point it
at anything you don't want to kill.''
</P>
<P>
   At Timberline Sporting Goods, where wall racks were stocked with
everything from shotguns to muzzle loaders, owner Mike Homan blamed
a lack of discipline, at home and in the schools. ``There's no
punishment for doing something wrong _ it's timeout, Junior, go to
the corner,'' Homan grumbled. ``You can't spank a kid in public
anymore.'' Smacking his fist into his palm, he said, ``My old man
would have said `Time out' _ yeah, when you wake up.''
</P>
<P>
   Homan and others said that exposure to an avalanche of violence,
on television, in videos and in pop music lyrics, had desensitized
young people about the danger of firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the kids who come into here are into the violence,''
said Penny Rupp, manager of Sundown Video. ``Definitely violence.
All the blood and guts they can get.''
</P>
<P>
   And Jim Builteman, a hunting-safety instructor, said: ``Today,
if you have a grudge against somebody, death is an alternative.
Fifty years ago, when I was a kid, you got in a fist fight, you got
a bloody nose. And that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   Out at the firing range, Klocker, the club president, speculated
that many young people had no understanding of the consequences of
pulling a trigger. ``They see so many movies on TV where the good
guy shoots the bad guy; then, next week, the bad guy is back on TV
again, shooting away,'' he said, as a young marksman shattered an
orange clay skeet with a shotgun blast.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing his round, Carl Day, the 14-year-old marksman,
nodded in agreement. Referring to the high school shooters, Carl
said: ``Those kids were probably frustrated. They didn't know much
about guns, and what they can do.''
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, 30 years of hunter-safety classes have proved so
successful that state health department statistics indicate that
hunting may be safer than fishing. From 1993 to 1995, three people
were killed in hunting accidents, while nine people died in fishing
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hunting teaches young people respect for life,'' said Criss
Payne, a Marine Corps veteran who was shooting at the range with
his young children. ``When they go out and kill an animal, they
have to clean it themselves, they have to drag it out. They know,
without a shadow of a doubt, what a gun does when you pull the
trigger.''

COMPANIES REACT QUICKLY TO COURT'S SEXUAL HARASSMENT RULINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the Supreme Court creating a new national policy on sexual
harassment virtually overnight, many companies are moving quickly
to re-examine their rules, expecting to adopt tougher measures to
meet the court's standards.
</P>
<P>
   Most large corporations already have strong harassment policies,
but human resource experts said that if there was a weak link in
those programs it was usually that the companies did not repeatedly
communicate the policy to all employees or did not have effective
mechanisms set up for employees to report harassment without fear
of reprisals.
</P>
<P>
   Executives, lawyers and consultants specializing in human
resources predicted that medium-size and smaller companies would
have to do the most to strengthen their anti-harassment policies.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the Supreme Court's two far-reaching decisions on
Friday came quickly. Corporations from Nabisco to Lockheed-Martin
were set to review their policies, corporate executives and
advisers said, to make sure they heed the court's holding that
employers will face broader exposure for sexual harassment by
supervisors, especially if the employers do not have strong
anti-harassment programs.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bernstein, a lawyer in Newark, N.J., who advises RJ
Reynolds and Continental Airlines on employment matters, said: ``In
light of these opinions, I'm telling my clients that the Supreme
Court is saying that if you want to minimize your liability, if you
want to insulate yourself, then establish clear policies,
distribute them among you work force. Make sure you can establish
that your employees have received your policies and your complaint
procedures and that they know precisely who it is they're supposed
to complain to.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't limited to sexual harassment,'' Bernstein said.
``The same general principles apply to claims of homosexual
harassment, racial harassment and national-origin harassment. This
is the perfect opportunity for employers to seize the day and
educate employees to their policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepping into a field that had been marked by confusion, the
Supreme Court expanded potential liability for sexual harassment by
ruling that employers could be held liable when a supervisor
threatened to demote or take other action against an employee who
refused the supervisor's sexual demands, even when the threats were
not carried out.
</P>
<P>
   But the court's majority wrote in the pair of 7-2 decisions that
employers could generally avoid liability in such cases by showing
that they had strong anti-harassment programs. In particular, the
rulings suggested that employers make sure they communicate those
policies to all employees and set up effective mechanisms for
receiving and reviewing harassment complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours after the decisions were issued, corporate counsels
and employment lawyers were reading and rereading the opinions to
figure out exactly how to advise their companies and clients.
</P>
<P>
   With companies eager to avoid the large-scale sexual harassment
settlements agreed to by corporate giants like Smith Barney and
Mitsubishi, several employment experts predicted that the ruling
would drum up a lot of business for consultants who advise
companies on sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi agreed to pay $34 million to settle a sexual
harassment case brought by female workers at a factory in Illinois,
while Smith Barney, in a proposed settlement, agreed to pay several
hundred thousand dollars to female workers who said they had been
harassed and to spend $15 million on anti-discrimination and
anti-harassment training.
</P>
<P>
   Employment experts predicted that tens of thousands of human
resources officials and senior executives would soon begin
reassessing their policies to reduce their employers' chance of
liability in which plaintiffs often win hundreds of thousands and
even millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Water-cooler discussions about harassment will now shift to
boardroom discussions about harassment,'' said Susan Meisinger,
senior vice president for the Society for Human Resource
Management, an association of more than 100,000 personnel and
employee relations professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The math has changed a bit,'' she added. ``These two decisions
are the culmination of a public focus on the subject, and employers
have to anticipate the cumulative impact of this will be more
litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Robin Conrad, senior vice president for litigation at the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce, said: ``After these decisions we'll be telling
people there are things you can do to prevent this from happening
and to protect yourself in the process. Have a policy and
effectively communicate it. Promptly investigate complaints. And
take prompt corrective action.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the two cases decided Friday, a former lifeguard sued
the city of Boca Raton, Fla., complaining that two male supervisors
had created a sexually hostile atmosphere for years through
offensive touching and lewd remarks. Even though the city had a
formal anti-harassment policy, the court found the city liable,
noting that Boca Raton had failed to disseminate the policy to the
beach employees.
</P>
<P>
   The court also faulted Boca Raton for making no effort to keep
track of the supervisors' conduct and for not making clear that
employees could bypass the harassing supervisors if they wanted to
file complaints.
</P>
<P>
   In the other case, an employee of Burlington Industries sued the
company, saying she felt compelled to quit after a supervisor had
said he could make life harder or easier for her depending on
whether she did such things as wear shorter skirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most employers should be paying attention to this to be sure
they're not behind on this issue,'' said Angela DeSilva, chief
counsel for Duke Energy Corp. in Houston. ``They should go back and
analyze whether they have a policy and analyze whether they're
effectively disseminating the policy.''

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At some companies, executives voiced confidence that they had
tough anti-harassment policies that would help protect them against
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Sellinger, chief labor and chief litigation counsel at
Nabisco, said: ``You'll probably find that the larger companies are
in really good shape. The medium-sized and smaller companies that
don't have a good human resources staff are not going to be in good
shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, she said Nabisco executives would certainly review
the court's decisions to make sure the company heeded the criteria
set forth to avoid liability.
</P>
<P>
   In its rulings, the Supreme Court analyzed three situations and
types of sexual harassment. In one, often called quid pro quo
harassment, the supervisor takes an adverse action _ like
dismissal, failing to promote, reducing benefits or reassigning
with significantly reduced responsibilities _ against an employee
who refuses to submit to the supervisor's sexual demands. In such
cases, the court wrote, affirming a long-standing line of cases,
that the employer is automatically liable, even when it has a
strong anti-harassment policy in place.
</P>
<P>
   In the second situation, generally called a hostile work
environment case, there is a sexually hostile environment, marked
by severe or pervasive conduct.
</P>
<P>
   In the third situation, a supervisor threatens a tangible job
detriment, like a demotion, to someone who spurns the supervisor's
advances, but the threat goes unfulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled that in these two situations the employer could
be held liable for the harassment, but could escape liability by
proving that it had ``exercised reasonable care to prevent and
correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled further that employers could also avoid
liability by showing that the employee asserting harassment
``unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or
corrective opportunities provided by the employer.''
</P>
<P>
   Invoking such a defense, employers would argue that it would be
wrong to hold them liable because an employee was unreasonable in
failing to complain to higher-ups and thus did not give the
employer the chance to correct the untoward behavior.
</P>
<P>
   While corporate officials applauded the rulings because they
drew clear lines about what to do to avoid liability, plaintiffs
lawyers and women's groups also praised the decisions for holding
that employers faced liability for harassment by supervisors, even
when there was no tangible adverse job action.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Davis, legal director for the National Organization for
Women Legal Education and Defense Fund, said, ``It does a very
smart thing. It continues to make sure that employers bear the
burden rather than the individual if harm is done. But it creates
very strong incentives for employers to be very vigilant in dealing
with sexual harassment. It makes it clear that it's important for
companies to be very explicit in having a zero-tolerance policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The lifeguard who sued, Beth Ann Faragher, now a lawyer in
Denver, said in an interview, ``This was an argument about
principle and is a victory for working women because it tells their
employers they must take affirmative steps to prevent''
harassment. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pitfalls aplenty have lurked around every corner
during President Clinton's visit to China. Political pitfalls: What
to say about Tiananmen Square? Protocol pitfalls: How to overcome
the president's habitual tardiness, which would surely grate on
Chinese ideas of punctuality?
</P>
<P>
   By no means least dangerous were the potential dinner-table
pitfalls, like those that confronted the American guest of honor
Saturday night at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. The
formal banquet is a Chinese institution, and at its end lies an
inevitable and obligatory round of toasts with the sorghum-based
firewater known as maotai. It smells a lot like JP-4, the stuff
that powers the engines on Air Force One, and it is only slightly
more drinkable.
</P>
<P>
   But drink it visitors must, and it wouldn't do to gag in the
presence of one's host. Richard Nixon knocked maotais back with
Chou En-lai on his historic trip in 1972, and a decade later George
Bush, then vice president, did the same thing with Deng Xiaoping.
``Ganbei,'' the Chinese say _ bottoms up, more or less. They mean
the glass, not you.
</P>
<P>
   No sipping is allowed. An aide who went to Beijing with Nixon
recalls that the president and Zhou looked into each other's maotai
cups at the end of each toast to make sure the other had drained
every drop. A forerunner of the Reaganite doctrine of trust but
verify, no doubt.
</P>
<P>
   And all this comes at the end of a multicourse feed where you
are expected to sample every dish. When Bush returned to China as
president in 1989 _ a trip I covered _ his party was served boar's
penis soup, or so the menu translation said. I wondered if it
wasn't a linguistic mishap like ``leg of lamp,'' but boar's penis
soup is what everyone thought it was. We did our duty.
</P>
<P>
   So did the author Theodore H. White, when served suckling pig at
a banquet given by Zhou in Chungking during World War II, when both
were youngsters. White, a correspondent for Time and a Jew,
protested as politely as he could that he did not eat pork. Zhou,
master of every situation even as a junior official, gestured with
his chopsticks and said: ``Teddy, this is China. Look again _ see?
Look. It looks to you like pig. But in China this is not a pig.
This is a duck.'' The writer laughed, shrugged and tucked into his
pork-duck, crackling included.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, they don't care whether you eat all the food, but
they will not tolerate wussing out on vodka. Down the hatch in one
gulp, and once a bottle is opened, it is rude not to finish it
before calling it a night.
</P>
<P>
   I remember more vividly than I would like a dinner on my first
trip to Moscow. I must have been almost 30, with college and the
army behind me, so I should have known better. But I persuaded
myself that I could match some Russian friends glass for rapid
glass, and I very nearly jumped off the balcony of a restaurant
called Praga.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years later, I did a six-month stint in the Soviet
Union, as it was then, and I learned to pace myself. At a farewell
dinner, I paced myself so well, nibbling zakuski between gulps,
that I never even considered a jump.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't. I was out cold, KO'd humiliatingly short of
midnight.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   American presidents have displayed a lot more decorum than I
while exchanging many a toast with Russian leaders over the past
few decades. Some may have learned the old Russian trick of dumping
the contents of a vodka glass into a water glass (which works fine,
as long as they don't catch you, and as long as you don't forget
and take a gulp of ``water'').
</P>
<P>
   Only one president I know of, whose name is probably best
suppressed here, publicly displayed vodka's formidable capacity for
undermining politesse, commenting somewhat indecorously after six
or seven belts upon a female aide's physical attributes.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Nixon handled these things well. He coolly exchanged
vodka toasts with Leonid Brezhnev at his swimming pool at San
Clemente in 1973, with Hollywood stars illuminating the evening. A
wine lover, he also developed an effective if stingy method for
conserving his best stock. He instructed the waiter on the
presidential yacht Sequoia, or so it is said, to wrap bottles in a
white towel before pouring. The president got Chateau Margaux, and
so did his special guests; the others got something less grand from
California.
</P>
<P>
   According to his valet in the days when he was a pitchman for
General Electric, Ronald Reagan had a strategy for postspeech
pow-wows with the company's executives and clients: The valet mixed
water and white wine in a thermos, and when it came time to pour
out the martinis, Reagan was given his relatively benign potion
while the others got their loudmouth soup.
</P>
<P>
   What you really want for toasts, of course, is champagne. The
British usually give you Pol Roger Cuvee Winston Churchill on
august occasions, which strikes me as perfect.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it will never give you a head that jerks like a
jackhammer, or cause the distress to the constitution that the
Australians politely call a Technicolor yawn. Lots of other local
specialties will, especially if you're not used to them.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of a long career, I have had disquieting
encounters with Danish aquavit (caraway flavored and drunk with a
beer chaser); French marc (made from the pips and skins of grapes
left in the wine press); Vietnamese wine with a pickled snake in
the bottle; various sugar-cane concoctions in the Caribbean, and
fenny, an Indian bruiser made from cashew nuts. All taste a little
like petroleum distillates. One slug makes your knees knock, two
make you drool and three fell you like a redwood.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Unicum, a bitter, syrupy digestive in an
orb-shaped bottle that is said to cure hangovers. It is
manufactured by Peter Zwack, former Hungarian ambassador to
Washington, former member of Parliament and all-around good guy. It
hurts me to say so, but in my experience it is unmatched for sheer
yuckiness. I call it the dark destroyer, even to my friend's face.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the recent American courtship of Mongolia has proved at
least one thing: Tamer drinks can taste just as bad as stronger
stuff. Nomads there drink fermented mare's milk, and visiting
bigwigs are asked to do likewise.
</P>
<P>
   On a trip last year, Hillary Rodham Clinton compared the
beverage, called airak, to yogurt. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright didn't compare it to anything, but she sternly instructed
those traveling with her: If you don't want to drink it, ``you must
touch it to your lips as if tasting it.''
</P>
<P>
   And no wincing. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Suddenly, these are nervous times for prosperity fans. The stock
market has the jitters; after going straight up all winter it has
been stuck in place since April. The Asian economic boom, another
great engine of American prosperity, is over. And the nation's
economy shows signs of slowing.
</P>
<P>
   Is this the beginning of the end of the Soaring Nineties? Who
knows? There are plenty of economic seers in the land who,
convinced that Americans are more efficient and productive than
ever, see the good times rolling on.
</P>
<P>
   Even the less sanguine say this may be the seventh inning rather
than the ninth. But enough warning flags are up to invite
comparisons with the other great periods of prosperity in modern
history, and how they ended.
</P>
<P>
   What is striking is that each of them _ the Gilded Age in the
late 19th century, the Roaring Twenties, the Fabulous Fifties and
Sixties _ ended suddenly, and in each case the end came as a shock.
The same was true of the more ambiguous period of growth that ended
with the stock-market crash of 1987. The warning signs were there,
but they were overlooked or minimized or simply beyond anyone's
power to control.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you stood in 1928 and tried to imagine what the next decade
would be like, you would never have imagined the Great Depression,
and each period of prosperity has been like that,'' said Henry
Kaufman, the Wall Street economist and consultant.
</P>
<P>
   The Gilded Age, for example, ended with the financial panic of
1893. A weakening U.S. currency frightened foreign investors,
particularly the British, and they pulled out their money, helping
to start a four-year depression.
</P>
<P>
   The Roaring Twenties crashed with the stock market in 1929, and
the Great Depression followed.
</P>
<P>
   The Fifties and Sixties gave way to an unlikely combination of
inflation and stagnant economic growth in the 1970s that shook
American confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Another stock-market crash, in 1987, brought the decade of greed
to a humbling conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Or did it really end? The bounce-back in the 1990s, after a
brief recession, brings some historians to the conclusion that the
present decade is really an extension of the 1980s _ half a
generation of almost unbroken prosperity, particularly for
upper-income people.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is remarkable about this era of prosperity is how long it
has lasted and how entrenched the orthodoxy of free markets has
become over all these years,'' said Alan Brinkley, the Columbia
University historian. ``We are really back to an age in which the
reigning ideology is very close to laissez-faire, as it was in the
Gilded Age.''
</P>
<P>
   That is one comparison. There are others. Implicit in them is
the suggestion that the current era of prosperity can be prolonged
by avoiding the mistakes that ended those earlier booms. Let's see.
</P>
<P>
   The Gilded Age Dissolves in Panic
</P>
<P>
   The Gilded Age, which lasted roughly 20 years, was born in the
pell-mell economic growth after the Civil War. Railroads spread
across the country. Steel mills blossomed, and other industries
came into being. Their owners often turned to foreigners,
particularly the British, to finance the projects.
</P>
<P>
   Competition and overexpansion made these new industrialists
vulnerable to bankruptcy. That, in turn, made the lenders nervous.
And then a conflict over the value of the nation's currency finally
pushed the lenders to call in their loans, which brought on the
Panic of 1893.
</P>
<P>
   The value of currency has, in different ways, been a source of
trouble in nearly every period of prosperity. It is an issue in the
maneuvering to prevent today's prosperity from running off the
rails.
</P>
<P>
   When dollars are scarce, their value rises. Reflecting this
higher value, interest rates rise for borrowers, and prices drop
for goods and services. The money, in effect, is worth more than
what it buys.
</P>
<P>
   One way to limit the supply is to pull dollars out of
circulation, as the Federal Reserve Board sometimes does now.
Another is to tie the dollar to gold, the practice in the Gilded
Age, before there was a central bank.
</P>
<P>
   A government pledges to convert each dollar into a fixed amount
of gold. Since there was not that much gold available in the Gilded
Age, the government could not print that many dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every government in the late 19th century adjusted its
economy to the gold standard. In the United States, that galled
farmers. They were a big part of the population, and they were
desperate. Partly because of overproduction, prices for their crops
kept falling. They needed low-interest credit, plenty of it, to
keep going, and because of the gold standard they could not get it.
Nor could they inflate their prices.
</P>
<P>
   The money, in limited supply, grew in value faster than their
produce. Thousands of farmers lost their land.
</P>
<P>
   Their solution was silver, which was much more abundant than
gold. Under pressure from the populist farmers movement, Congress
in 1890 authorized the Treasury to issue dollars backed by silver
as well as gold. That greatly increased the money supply and made
credit available at lower rates. But the dollar lost value. A
``cheap'' silver dollar could be converted into just as much gold
as a dollar backed by gold.
</P>
<P>
   The currency, in effect, was devalued, particularly in the eyes
of lenders in Britain, a country on a pure gold standard. Nervous
already from various bankruptcies, they called in their dollar
loans and converted them into gold _ behaving much as American and
European lenders did last winter when they called in loans to South
Korea and converted them back to hard currencies when that
country's won fell in value.
</P>
<P>
   President Grover Cleveland got the silver act repealed within
months. But that did not lessen the concern that the dollar would
be devalued. And as gold reserves fell below $100 million in April
1893, the panic was on.
</P>
<P>
   The various players in this drama knew the potential
consequences of their actions, historians explain, but given the
passions and the political struggle, no one could stop the process.
</P>
<P>
   That is the great lesson from the Gilded Age: The forces that
unwind a prosperous era take on a life of their own. And that
remains an issue over a century later, particularly in a world that
still views a strong currency as a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   The United States returned firmly to a gold standard only after
the populist farmers' candidate, William Jennings Bryan, lost the
1896 presidential election to William McKinley. By then the
depression had almost run its course. And a surge in the supply of
gold, from new mines, brought relief to the farmers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Roaring Twenties End in Depression
</P>
<P>
   The crash of 1929, the bursting of one of those speculative
bubbles that have appeared periodically over the last three
centuries, was probably inevitable. The Great Depression, however,
might have been preventable. The 1987 crash demonstrated that the
damage resulting from a stock-market plunge can be limited. But
that was by no means clear in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   It was another decade of rapid expansion. New technologies
appeared. New industries came into being. There were huge
investments, eye-catching mergers and mass production of
automobiles, appliances and other goods. Most significant, millions
of Americans, for the first time, participated in the stock market.
The small investor had arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The financial markets, in fact, were growing too rapidly for
policy-makers to fully grasp what was happening and develop ways to
deal with the problems that would arise, notes Barry Eichengreen,
an economist at the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   The necessary safeguards _ deposit insurance, bank regulation,
stock trading rules, the Securities and Exchange Commission _ came
only in the 1930s. But they stand today as a safety net to mitigate
the damage from a market crash, and from the bankruptcies and bank
failures that accompany it.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve, formed in 1913, was also groping. The panic
of 1893 and another in 1907 had made the need for a central bank
obvious. But its role as a lender of last resort and as a supplier
of cheap credit in hard times would take years to develop. That
role was fully in place in 1987, on the day after the stock market
crash, when Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, lowered interest
rates and announced that the central bank stood ready to make
credit available to keep the stock market and its players solvent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Federal Reserve and its foreign counterparts were all
groping in the 1920's toward an understanding of what a lender of
last resort should do domestically,'' said Eichengreen, who is also
an adviser to the International Monetary Fund. Now after the global
financial crisis brought about by Asia's downfall, ``We are groping
toward trying to understand whether we need an international lender
of last resort and, if so, how it should operate,'' Eichengreen
added.
</P>
<P>
   There was another problem pulling at the Fed after the 1929
crash, a replay of a theme that had been so important in the Panic
of 1893. The Fed has been accused of responding to the crash by
raising interest rates, thus restricting credit and demand in the
teeth of the developing Depression _ such behavior being just the
opposite of what was needed.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact the Fed vacillated, lowering rates at times, and
deciding only in 1931 to push them up, said Charles Calomiris, an
economist at Columbia University's Graduate School of Business.
</P>
<P>
   What drove the Fed was England's decision to go off the gold
standard. By raising interest rates, the Fed, in effect, made the
dollar more valuable, which meant that dollar holders were less
likely to convert their dollars to gold and once again deplete the
nation's reserve.
</P>
<P>
   But the cost, once again, was a Depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commitment to the gold standard constrained how much the
Fed could worry about managing _ stimulating _ demand,'' Calomiris
said. That preference for a strong dollar may still be in play.
</P>
<P>
   The Postwar Years
</P>
<P>
   Never were two decades more prosperous in the United States than
the 1950s and 1960s. Consumer demand, unfulfilled in the Depression
and the war years, drove the economy. So did military spending. The
United States became the supplier to a rebuilding world. Mass
production and marketing made this the most productive era. As the
nation's workers turned out more, their incomes rose. So they spent
more, leaving the impression that the nation's output was
limitless. It was not.
</P>
<P>
   The costly Vietnam War and the Great Society programs strained
the system. Prices, responding to shortages, began to rise in the
late 1960s. The 1973 Arab embargo made oil prices shoot up,
increasing inflation. Japan, Germany and other countries re-entered
the marketplace, cutting into U.S. sales.
</P>
<P>
   That helped to reduce the rate at which the economy,
productivity and incomes grew. None has ever recovered its old
vigor, despite a considerable improvement in the last two years.
Instead, upper-income people have been the big beneficiaries in the
current era of prosperity. Corporate America, freed from many
government constraints, argues that it is stronger because of the
change. But whether the laissez-faire system that has emerged
strengthens the nation's hand for the next crisis is anyone's
guess.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese are under pressure to stimulate their economy by
issuing more yen. But that weakens the yen, which creates problems
for American and Asian exporters, straining these economies. What
we need, Calomiris said, is a coordinated action in which the
Federal Reserve agrees publicly to expand the American money
supply. The goal would be to offset the Japanese action and keep
currency values constant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greenspan could announce no interest rate increases for six
months,'' Calomiris said. ``That would be an example of the kind of
policy coordination that would be very effective.''
</P>
<P>
   And very uncharacteristic of the Federal Reserve.

SHOWING TRUST IN CLINTON, CHINESE ALLOWED RARE TELEVISED DEBATE  
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: CHINA-SUMMIT, CHINA-TV-BROADCAST, CHINA-REACT,
CHINA-HILLARY) 
(nk) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ President Clinton handed China's leaders a gift simply
by coming here, giving them global respect despite the sharp
criticism of his China policy back home.
</P>
<P>
   With Saturday's surprise decision to televise an extended news
conference and debate on human rights, China may have returned the
favor. The live telecast allowed Clinton to make forceful
statements on human rights and Tibet before a Chinese audience,
thereby addressing American criticism that he was appeasing a
repressive government even as he pressed forward with his strategy
of engaging the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Though the basic differences between the United States and China
are no secret here, it was highly unusual for the Chinese to see
anyone on television calling the 1989 killings on Tiananmen Square
wrong, or praising the integrity of the Dalai Lama. Chinese news
reports on touchy debates are invariably one-sided and brief _ as
was the television coverage Saturday night on the day's encounter.
</P>
<P>
   American officials were elated with the televised debate,
convinced it would help justify the president's complex policy of
engaging a country with fundamentally different views on freedom.
</P>
<P>
   National Security Adviser Sandy Berger gloated that the event
was a first, allowing open debate on topics censored in China's
official press. It was by no means clear how many Chinese saw the
press conference, since the fact that it would be broadcast live
was not advertised in advance. Word of the debate, however, was
spreading around Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the live broadcast, which must have been approved at the
highest levels, was a testament to the Chinese government's trust
in Clinton, who is viewed here as a great statesman, pursuing
America's long-term interests with China despite backbiting from
his political enemies.
</P>
<P>
   They had to know he might forcefully raise sensitive issues, but
also gambled that he would raise them, as he did, with a nod to
China's historical and cultural differences, and that the two
presidents would end the hour with smiles.
</P>
<P>
   Both leaders could turn Saturday's exchange to political
advantage. It provided an example of their largely shared vision of
a partnership in which common interests are pursued while
differences are acknowledged and debated, as they did in Washington
last October when Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited. In this
convenient formulation, the airing of differences becomes a sign of
strength in the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the statements Saturday also foretell discord and
disappointment. For inherent in Clinton's vision, and his ability
to sell it domestically, is the idea that by engaging China,
promoting investment and trade as well as educational and technical
ties, he will cause China to be more like the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Over time he might be right, but in the coming years, at least,
there is no guarantee that China's profound economic and social
changes will lead to Western-style political freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's broadcast signaled the security of Jiang and his
policies of economic reform and deeper ties with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this shows the Chinese leadership is very confident,''
said Liu Xuecheng, an expert on Chinese-American relations at the
China Center for International Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Far from shying away from debate, Jiang had clearly prepared for
the pointed exchanges. Though an American reporter first asked
about the detention of dissidents, it was no accident that a
Chinese news reporter asked him to explain China's human rights
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was it coincidental that he had prepared detailed notes on
the subject and that he volunteered to expound on China's Tibet
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think President Clinton is a strong defender of the American
interest, and I am a strong defender of the Chinese interest,''
Jiang said. ``But despite that, we still can have very friendly
exchanges of views and discussion. And I think that is democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Along similar lines, Shen Dingli, deputy director of American
Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, saw the debate as
positive. ``Both countries could uphold their positions on human
rights, but still be friendly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, too, said at the press conference that ``it is
important that whatever our disagreements over past actions, China
and the United States must go forward on the right side of history
for the future sake of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The initial days of his visit have in fact highlighted these
differences. The day he arrived, a hard-line culture chief in
modern, prosperous Shanghai blocked the travel to New York of a
historical opera, commissioned and paid for by Lincoln Center,
because it did not meet her ideas of cultural correctness.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit to Xian was preceded by the temporary detention
of a few local democracy campaigners _ a routine roundup for China,
but one that shocked the visitors.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``debate'' Saturday, Jiang gave not an inch. Dissidents
were jailed, he said, because they had violated the law _ and isn't
this what China's vaunted progress toward the ``rule of law'' is
all about? he seemed to ask.
</P>
<P>
   The use of combat troops to end the 1989 student demonstrations
in Tiananmen Square, killing hundreds in the process, could not
have been a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had the Chinese government not taken the resolute measures we
did then we could not have enjoyed the stability that we are
enjoying today,'' Jiang said, repeating an oft-used argument.
</P>
<P>
   On Tibet, Jiang sounded more conciliatory than another official
did on Friday when he all but called the Dalai Lama a murderer and
torturer. As Jiang put it, if only the Dalai Lama will acknowledge
that Tibet is part of China and that Taiwan is a province of China,
then ``the door to negotiation is open.''
</P>
<P>
   This formulation has actually been policy for some time.
However, despite the Dalai Lama's recent statements that he is
ready to talk about degrees of autonomy for Tibet, Chinese leaders
insist that his actions still betray a dedication to independence.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday afternoon Berger was asked whether China had made any
concessions on rights. He said, referring to the televised debate,
``The very fact that this happened is movement on the part of the
Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   Shen, the Shanghai scholar, made a similar point. ``We need to
view the achievements of this summit through the interactions,'' he
said, ``not what gets written on paper.'' &QL;

MRS. CLINTON MEETS WITH LEADERS OF CHINA'S WOMEN'S MOVEMENT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BEIJING _ Hillary Rodham Clinton met with some of the best and
brightest of Beijing's vibrant women's movement on Saturday,
discussing a wide range of sometimes sensitive issues from domestic
violence to unemployment to China's high rates of female suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton mostly sat back and listened as the panel of seven
Chinese women told of the multitude of problems women in this
country still face and of their work to solve them.
</P>
<P>
   Although many of the panelists have long been outspoken on
women's issues in front of small groups, such frank discussion in a
public international forum was unusual. And the light atmosphere
was in marked contrast to the tension surrounding the International
Women's Conference that Mrs. Clinton attended in Beijing in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The panelists included Xie Lihua, a journalist who has
championed the cause of China's rural women, and Liu Bohong of the
official All-China Women's Federation, who displayed the newly
published Chinese translation of the American women's medical work,
``Our Bodies, Ourselves'' (Touchstone, 1996).
</P>
<P>
   At the end, a clearly appreciative Mrs. Clinton said, ``I don't
think I've ever been in a more lively, energetic and informed
discussion than this one today.''
</P>
<P>
   The panelists described the many projects under way to improve
the status of women, but their remarks were filled with reminders
that deep-rooted cultural discrimination persists, particularly in
the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Xie likes to remind people that if you knock at a door in
rural China, women are likely to answer, ``Nobody's home,'' if
there are no men inside.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, she founded the magazine Rural Women Knowing
All to give women in the countryside a voice. At Saturday's forum,
she described how the magazine had published self-help articles on
reproductive health, set up programs for women who are migrant
workers in Beijing and helped organize small loans for women to
start cottage industries.
</P>
<P>
   But she and other panelists described with bittersweet smiles
the biases that such women's programs must overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Ge Youli of the U.N. Development Program in Beijing told of
organizing meetings in the countryside to explain loan programs for
women and having only husbands turn up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We say `Where are your wives?''' Ms. Ge said. ``They say, `At
home cooking, of course.''' She described how the men are then
instructed to play a game of what Americans call ``Telephone,''
where the first is given a message which is passed down a line of
10. By the end, she said, the message had changed. ``That's why
your wives should be here,'' she told them.
</P>
<P>
   But the panelists also told of poor rural women who with the
help of such loans had escaped dreary lives by setting up
prosperous businesses, such as tofu shops and pig farms, and of how
the traditional notion that ``only men are important'' was
changing.
</P>
<P>
   Another panelist, Chen Mingxia, a lawyer at the Chinese Academy
of Social Sciences, described work in educating women about their
legal rights. Although China has a fairly comprehensive women's
rights law on paper, discrimination against women is common in
areas like hiring and housing.
</P>
<P>
   At Beijing's prestigious universities there is a saying to
describe the hiring hierarchy on graduation: first men with a
Beijing residency permit, then men without a Beijing residency
permit, only then the women.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chen described how a rural legal aid center helped a woman
who wanted to divorce her abusive husband but had neither the money
nor the know-how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   The panelists excitedly described a wide range of ambitious
projects to improve the status of women, from efforts to improve
the high drop-out rate among rural girls to Ms. Liu's research on
images of women in the media. Some are conducted under the auspices
of the Chinese government and others by foreign organizations, like
the Ford Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most revealing about how far the discussion has come
since 1995 was the moment when Ms. Liu produced the bright
red-covered ``American Our Bodies, Ourselves,'' a translation
project that at times had been stalled by political debates about
what could and could not be said in China.
</P>
<P>
   No matter that the final product was missing the American
edition's sections on lesbianism and masturbation or that a number
of pictures were not reproduced. At last, the book was out. &QL;

LIVE DEBATE ON TV IS A RARITY FOR CHINESE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: CHINA-SUMMIT, CHINA-REACT, CHINA-ASSESS, CHINA-HILLARY) 
(lb) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ What is perhaps most remarkable about Saturday's
exchange between President Clinton and President Jiang Zemin is
that the debate, covering sensitive topics from human rights to
Tibet, was broadcast live all over China, via China Central
Television-1, the government's main television station.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a first,'' said a senior editor from the
station, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``We've never done
live coverage of a press conference between Chinese leaders and
leaders from another country before.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, live television coverage of important political events
is a relatively new development here. Last fall, when Jiang visited
the United States, all events were taped, edited and shown later.
Difficult discussions, like portions of the joint news conference
between the Chinese and American presidents in Washington, or
possibly embarrassing scenes, like Jiang swimming in Hawaii, were
edited out.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday, any Chinese citizen could have watched the two
presidents debate the merits of arresting dissidents and the 1989
crackdown on student-led demonstrators in Tiananmen Square. Any
citizen, that is, who happened to be tuned to CCTV-1 at midday on a
blisteringly hot summer Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   For although the news conference was broadcast live in its
entirety, it was never listed on television schedules or otherwise
advertised. And, hours after a lively debate in which both
presidents performed admirably, the conference effectively
disappeared _ replaced by an edited version for the evening news.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese television has just recently moved toward live coverage
of important political events _ although clearly with great
ambivalence. Aside from a brief period in the spring of 1989, when
press controls were eased and some episodes in the democracy
movement were broadcast live, only highly ceremonial events, like
treaty signings, or scripted speeches by Chinese leaders were shown
as they happened.
</P>
<P>
   State television produced 10 live broadcasts from the National
People's Congress session in March, including a somewhat
controversial news conference in which a Western reporter asked the
newly elected prime minister, Zhu Rongi, to comment on the
Tiananmen crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   But Zhu, after all, is a reliable party man. This time, who knew
what Clinton might say?
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, said the CCTV editor, the station's leaders decided
to go ahead with a broadcast. He said the decision was partly a
reflection of the government-controlled media's greater openness,
and partly an acknowledgment that it has become harder to conceal
news from Chinese citizens these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't hesitate to show it live even though we knew that
lots of sensitive topics could come up,'' the editor said. ``But if
we didn't do it there are other ways for people to get news, from
other stations or from the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was there for an hour. And then it was gone _ to the
disappointment of the many Chinese excited about the Clinton visit
who said they would have tuned in if only they had known.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The handling of the news conference followed what is becoming a
familiar pattern: sensitive moments from live broadcasts of the
National People's Congress, including some of Zhu's remarks and the
retirement of the popular foreign minister, Qian Qichen, were also
later relegated to the cutting-room floor.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, hours after the news conference, extensive reports
by the official New China News Agency omitted Clinton's statement
that the ``tragic loss of life'' in Tiananmen Square was ``wrong.''
Nor did they include an American reporter's question about the
detention of four dissidents in Xian and 2,000 other dissidents
reported to be in jail. They did, however, obliquely acknowledge
that Clinton has raised the issues of Tiananmen, Tibet and human
rights and gave Jiang's responses.
</P>
<P>
   The 7 p.m. news showed brief, bland segments of each president's
opening remarks, and a picture of the American reporter asking the
question on dissidents _ with the sound deleted. A 9 p.m. ``special
report'' carried a five-minute account of the state banquet this
evening, followed by a two-minute segment on trains.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the live broadcast, the CCTV anchor for what had
been scheduled as a 15-minute news conference but turned into a
major impromptu political debate, came up with a most fitting
epilogue:
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that to communicate with each other takes time,'' he
said, adding, ``Anyhow, face to face is better than back to back.''

COMMENTARY: ALL TRIPPED UP 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A friend of mine who knows Linda Tripp called to
see if I wanted to meet the Iago of Pentagon City.
</P>
<P>
   We could have dinner. Chat. Get to know each other in a relaxed
setting.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, dear readers, the prospect filled me with fear.
</P>
<P>
   Was Linda Tripp shopping for a new best girlfriend? And why me?
</P>
<P>
   When Kenneth Starr's whistleblower has her big moment before the
grand jury this week, she will chronicle her betrayal of her last
best girlfriend, who was horrified to find that Ms. Tripp had
secretly taped those desperate confidences about the Big Creep and
turned them over to the Little Creep.
</P>
<P>
   I imagined a rendezvous with Linda in a nocturnal alley with
cigarettes and fog and zither music. She would bring her wire; I
would bring my tape recorder.
</P>
<P>
   But I declined. The position of being Linda's girlfriend looked
too daunting. I knew she'd always be egging me on to do something
stupid _ sending a lovey-dovey tape to a man who couldn't care less
or treating Vernon Jordan like an employment agency.
</P>
<P>
   I decided it would be more prudent to keep up with her in the
media.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, the man who spent the most time proliferating gossip
about Ms. Tripp last week was the Rector of American Journalism,
James Fallows. The editor of U.S. News &AMP; World Report made the
rounds of the same TV talk shows he recently made a career of
deploring. He was flacking his magazine's account of more Monica
tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The noble, puritanical Fallows is now just another groveling,
pandering, sex-addled newsmagazine hack,'' laughed another
newsmagazine editor.
</P>
<P>
   The man who excoriated journalists for sinking into the muck of
scandals, rather than working with the government to solve public
policy problems, was now muck-sodden, hyping a story that featured
such revelations as: ``Tripp and Lewinsky discuss an incident in
which Lewinsky thought the president was becoming sexually aroused
when Lewinsky told him about her Defense Department trip to Bosnia
in July 1996.''
</P>
<P>
   (You know what it does to me when you say Sarajevo ...)
</P>
<P>
   Fallows tried to dignify his descent into tawdriness with some
high-minded fiddle-faddle. The story says its source ``had no
ideological or commercial motivation to favor the president, the
independent counsel, or any other party in the dispute.'' Surely
such a pure, disinterested, even-keeled leaker does not exist in
this city of vipers.
</P>
<P>
   He claimed his account of two hours of tape corrected the
distortions in Newsweek's edited transcript of 90 minutes. But
there are 20 hours of tape. And so there are still more than 16
hours of corrections to be made. Some scoop.
</P>
<P>
   At least Newsweek heard the tape, and gave readers a transcript.
We don't know what the U.S. News reporter was allowed to do. What
does ``reviewing the material'' mean? The reporter could not even
take notes as she ``reviewed.''
</P>
<P>
   Fallows said his story cast doubt on Starr's charge that the
president wanted to buy Monica's silence with a job, because on
these tapes Monica and Linda were talking about asking the
president for help two months before Monica was subpoenaed in the
Paula Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   But The New York Times and Newsweek reported long ago that
Monica had a job interview with then-U.N. delegate Bill Richardson,
arranged by the president's secretary in mid-October, two months
before Monica was subpoenaed in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   The big question persists: Where does a young, low-level
Pentagon employee making $30,000 a year get the gumption to demand
that the White House find her a job for $90,000 where she can do
``something easy'' _ as she says in the U.S. News article _ not
hard like media relations?
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. News story tries to support Clinton by suggesting the
press mistakenly characterized the tape Monica messengered to him
as erotic when it was romantic. On that cassette, the story says,
``She suggests that perhaps she and Clinton could have box dinners
and watch a movie, `tawk,' exchange a few hugs.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that the U.S. News material does not improve the
president's image. If anything, Monica seems even more egregiously
used.
</P>
<P>
   Brill. Fallows. On to next week's fetid buzz. &QL;

 &HT;    CLINTON TELEVISED TALK ON TIANANMEN IS BIGGEST CHINA
ACCOMPLISHMENT SO FAR
 &HT;    With CHINA-CLINTON-0628.
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ In Villa 18 of the Diaoyutai Guest House, President
Bill Clinton was still restless.
</P>
<P>
   It was late Friday night. Bothered by his allergies and
unsettled about his controversial rendezvous at Tiananmen Square
set for the next morning, the president was polishing a single
paragraph.
</P>
<P>
   He was trying to perfect what turned out to be the major
accomplishment since he arrived in China. Clinton hoped to say on
Chinese state television Saturday that Chinese leaders had been
wrong to brutalize pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square
nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to state it in a very respectful way to the Chinese
people,'' related White House spokesman Michael McCurry. ``He
wanted his words to have a maximum impact on the people of China.''
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, Clinton's emissaries had been pressing the Chinese
for assurances he would be allowed to talk on Chinese television.
They'd had favorable hints from the Chinese, but nothing was pinned
down.
</P>
<P>
   It was finally at 10:30 a.m. (China time) Saturday, two days
after his arrival in China, that the word finally came. McCurry
said that's when Clinton learned that his joint press conference
with China's President Jiang Zemin would be broadcast live on
nationwide Chinese television a half-hour later.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his late-night text polishing, Clinton was ready with
a polite introductory passage reciting Tiananmen's historical
importance for the last eight years. Sandwiched in the middle was
one stinging soundbite that criticized in no uncertain terms
China's bloody suppression of the 1989 pro-democracy movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all our agreements, we still disagree about the meaning of
what happened there,'' Clinton said. ``I believe, and the American
people believe, that the use of force and the tragic loss of life
was wrong. I believe, and the American people believe, that freedom
of speech, association and religion are, as recognized by U.N.
Charter, the right of people everywhere and should be protected by
their governments.''
</P>
<P>
   Jiang, seated next to Clinton on a gold-trimmed dias, had a
comeback ready.
</P>
<P>
   First the Chinese president quoted Dong Zhongshu, a philosopher
of the Han Dynasty more than 2000 years ago: ``Of all the living
things nurtured between heaven and the Earth, the most valuable is
human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he said the 1989 pro-democracy movement amounted to
``political disturbances'' that had to be dealt with through
``resolute measures.'' Otherwise, he said, ``we could not have
enjoyed the stability that we are enjoying today.''
</P>
<P>
   China's ambassador to Washington Li Zhaoxing told Clinton aides
that as many as 500 million Chinese heard the live Clinton-Jiang
press conference on TV and radio.
</P>
<P>
   White House National Security Adviser Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger,
summing up the day's achievements, said the chance to speak openly
about Tiananmen at a live press conference was ``truly historic''
and ``extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger was able to generate less enthusiastic words to describe
other achievements, though the traveling White House staff did pass
out a 14-page fact sheet entitled ``Achievements of the U.S.-China
Summit.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact sheet contained just one specific deal. It was a
one-sentence nuclear weapons ``detargeting'' agreement, by which
the U.S. and China promised at some unspecified time in the future
to stop pointing strategic nuclear missiles at each other's
territory.
</P>
<P>
   A long list of other topics proved too controversial for
solution, at least during the first day of summit talks:
</P>
<P>
   MISSILE EXPORTS: China, which has long supplied short-range
missiles to Pakistan, rebuffed the Clinton Administration's efforts
to shut off an arms supply relationship that China considers
strategically and commercially important. The White House said
China and the U.S. will continue missile export consultations later
in this year.
</P>
<P>
   TRADE TERMS: The two summit partners remained divided on terms
for China's entry into the World Trade Organization. China still
wants to be classified as a ``developing nation,'' which would
allow it to keep high tariff barriers on imports. The American side
insists that China is an advanced country that should lower the
trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was clearly progress made, but clearly it did not go far
enough,'' assessed White House National Economic Adviser Gene
Sperling.
</P>
<P>
   TIBET: Clinton publicly urged Jiang to ``resume a dialogue''
with the exiled Dalai Lama, in return for the Tibetan leader's
recognition ``that Tibet is a part of China.'' Jiang seemed to open
the door for direct talks with the Dalai Lama, but only if he first
declares that Tibet is an ``inalienable part of China'' and Taiwan
is a province of China.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao pitched icy water
over the prospects of Tibet talks in a strong critique of the Dalai
Lama.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has laid obstacles to the contacts between the two sides
and all this has shown the Dalai Lama has no sincerity in dialogue
with the central government,'' Zhu said. ``And the responsibility
for the failure of the dialogue between the two sides rests fully
with the Dalai Lama's side.''
</P>
<P>
   TAIWAN: At the press conference, Jiang remarked that the Taiwan
question is ``the most important and the most sensitive issue at
the core of China-U.S. relations.'' Clinton gave a notably brief
reply, saying he had reaffirmed America's ``long-standing one China
policy'' and had ``urged'' China to resolve the Taiwan issue
through ``cross-strait discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, Clinton's statement fell far short of the
full-scale reiteration of U.S.-Taiwan policy that Chinese diplomats
have been seeking for months.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for no apparent reason, the Chinese spokesman Zhu delivered
a surprisingly positive assessment of Clinton's Taiwan position,
saying Clinton had ``reiterated the relevant commitments'' on
Taiwan. The explanation may become evident on Monday, when Clinton
is expected to elaborate on Taiwan policy in a speech American
aides said Clinton may make a more elaborate Taiwan statement in a
speech Monday at Beijing University.

<P>
   BEIJING _ President Bill Clinton was headed to a
government-regulated Protestant church Sunday to worship and talk
about the free practice of religion, in what may be the most
personal remarks he will deliver during his sweep across China.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton already made blunt comments about China's human rights
practices on Saturday, during an exceptional televised news
conference in which he and China's President Jiang Zemin announced
their summit a success. Then they went on to engage in a polite
debate over the 1989 violent crushing of the Tiananmen Square
protests and other sensitive subjects.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday at the Chongwenmen church, not far from the seat of
state authority in the heart of Beijing, Clinton is to address the
congregation of 2,300 members. Afterward, he planned to talk to a
group of clergy, who in China face the prospect of being replaced
if they displease the government.
</P>
<P>
   Restriction of religious freedom has loosened in some Chinese
localities, but it remains one of the practices most criticized by
human rights activists.
</P>
<P>
   The week before Clinton left on this China visit, he met with
three American religious leaders who investigated religious
practices in China, including Tibet, last winter. The report they
released upon returning said conditions had improved in some
places, but that repression still existed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Clinton) is going to reflect about what they told him,''
White House spokesman Michael McCurry said Saturday. ``He's going
to talk about the importance we attach in the United States to the
freedom to worship.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself said last week that this speech is ``most likely
to be one that I will do virtually by myself and close to the
time'' of the event.
</P>
<P>
   The summit talks Saturday produced no breakthroughs on either
trade or limits on missile sales, which had been considered the two
most important issues to be addressed, but the leaders pronounced
the summit a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talks were positive, constructive and productive,'' Jiang
said at the summit's close.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our friendship may never be perfect -- no friendship is,''
Clinton said. ``But I hope it will last forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides agreeing to stop targeting missiles at each other's
territory, the presidents agreed to tighten controls on the export
of chemicals that can be used for weapons, called for establishing
a new compliance mechanism for the biological weapons convention
and committed their countries to ending the export and
``indiscriminate use'' of anti-personnel land mines.
</P>
<P>
   They also set up a number of exchange programs and cooperative
projects on the environment, health improvements and legal
training.
</P>
<P>
   The most remarkable development was that the news conference
televised live to an estimated half-billion Chinese at the close of
the formal talks.
</P>
<P>
   It not only showed Jiang discussing the ``extensive and in-depth
exchange of views'' between the two, but Clinton relating that he
reaffirmed America's ``one-China'' policy during the summit.
</P>
<P>
   National Security Adviser Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger called it ``a
truly historic press conference'' showing for the first time ``the
leader of the United States and the leader of China discussing and
debating a range of issues, but most particularly human rights, to
a live audience across China and the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Americans disagree with the use of force at
Tiananmen Square and suggested that China release some of the
prisoners arrested ``for offenses no longer on the books in
China.'' He referred to the sweeping law against
counter-revolutionary activities under which thousands of Chinese
were arrested over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang reiterated the Chinese stand that the aim of maintaining
order and stability was paramount.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the arrests of dissidents just prior to Clinton's
arrival -- acts that drew critical comments from Clinton and other
White House officials -- Jiang said an investigation ``shows that
there was never such a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The American side deemed that very response ``unacceptable'' on
Friday, but by Saturday was trying to paint the summit in a golden
glow, so simply ignored the fact that Chinese authorities still
appeared to be stonewalling the question.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese president also himself raised the charges in America
that the Chinese government had made illegal campaign contributions
to the Democratic National Committee, calling them ``absurd and
ridiculous'' and ``sheer fabrications.''
</P>
<P>
   ``China can never do such a thing,'' he said, ``and China never
interferes in other country's internal affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides being televised live, excerpts of the news conference
were shown on the main Chinese evening news show, which was mostly
devoted to the Clinton visit. The excerpts, however, did not
include the sensitive comments on human rights.
</P>
<P>
   The extensive state news coverage began with China's formal
welcoming of Clinton at the Great Hall of the People on the western
edge of Tiananmen Square, a ceremony some American members of
Congress had urged Clinton to skip. There followed a biographical
sketch of Clinton, then the news show ran through highlights of the
day. It even included interviews in the United States with
political and academic figures.
</P>
<P>
   A late-breaking addition to the news was a report on the state
banquet Jiang held for the Clintons in the cavernous hall that can
hold 5,000 diners.
</P>
<P>
   In one unexplained incident, a bus of journalists leaving the
dinner was suddenly stopped by a woman who had lain down in the
road. She appeared to be holding a piece of paper that she extended
up in the direction of the bus.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists on the bus said a man appeared next to her, and
immediately two green-shirted policemen roughly grabbed the pair
and dragged them out of the road and onto the sidewalk. The bus
driver refused requests to stop so the journalists could find out
what was happening.

<P>
   BEIJING _ Sunday evening in the candlelit sanctuary of Dong
Tang, a ``patriotic'' Catholic church, a four-year-old Chinese girl
in a frilly dress sang the memorized words of a hymn with as much
gusto as the adults around her.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 worshipers chanted alleluias, partook holy
communion and heard of miraculous events at the Sermon on the
Mount. Elderly men, young couples, three sweaty teens in baggy
pants -- basketball in tow -- filled two-thirds of the pews last
week.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese-language service looked much like a mass in America.
</P>
<P>
   But the priest could not mention Catholicism's most revered
living figure, Pope John Paul II, or even whisper a reference to an
issue central to the church worldwide: the stand against abortion.
</P>
<P>
   And fortunately for the four-year-old's mother, no hard-line
Chinese authorities were in Dong Tang (East Church) that night
looking for violators of government mandates, because it is
forbidden to spread religion to anyone under 18.
</P>
<P>
   China controls all Christian groups by forcing them to register
as social organizations, regulating what they preach and arresting
or detaining those who cross the government-drawn line of
acceptable religious practice. Both Protestants and Catholics must
be part of China's ``patriotic'' religious movement, which means
they cannot align with a foreign-based church.
</P>
<P>
   These are the kinds of restrictions advocates of human rights
hope President Bill Clinton's visit today to a Beijing Protestant
church will spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic Dong Peiying, 77, saw her religion outlawed and its
sanctuaries desecrated during the Cultural Revolution from
1966-1976. She welcomes any restoration of open religious practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite free for people to worship. There are many people
who believe in religion now. Usually there are no obstacles,'' said
the diminutive white-haired woman leaving the Dong Tang service,
around the corner from Beijing's Forbidden City.
</P>
<P>
   But she sighed when asked about her church's break with the
Vatican, which China's Communist government directed after the 1949
revolution in order to expel foreign influence from a potent social
force.
</P>
<P>
   Will China's Catholics ever return to Rome's fold?
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it is possible. We hope it is possible,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese think tank specialists speak of a possible breakthrough
in informal talks quietly going on between intermediaries for the
Vatican and the Chinese government. To facilitate the reported
compromise, the Vatican would end diplomatic recognition of Taiwan
and take an even trickier step of agreeing Rome would not appoint
archbishops in China.
</P>
<P>
   In back-channel talks in March, a Catholic emissary is said to
have cited as a possible precedent a centuries-old agreement with
French and German monarchs, in which the Vatican reportedly allowed
local authorities to select archbishops.
</P>
<P>
   Even could those conditions be met, the Holy See would face
repeated compromises in reuniting with the Chinese church under
current government controls.
</P>
<P>
   At least four million Chinese Catholics agree with parishioner
Dong that the constraints are not too onerous, and they worship in
the officially-sanctioned church, according to government figures.
Another 10 million Chinese participate in the Protestant churches
registered with the government.
</P>
<P>
   But 30 million or more are estimated to gather in underground
churches in defiance of government regulations, praying in
apartments or caves or fields.
</P>
<P>
   Local enforcement of the national policy is uneven. Some
unregistered churches remain fairly free from harassment, said Nina
Shea, director of the Center for Religious Freedom in Washington,
D.C. Other churches are not.
</P>
<P>
   This is the only underground movement in China. There is no
Solidarity, no samizat press,'' said Shea, referring to the labor
union that brought down Poland's Communist regime and the
underground publications that criticized Soviet life. ``The Chinese
have been terribly efficient in wiping out dissent.''
</P>
<P>
   And dissent, according to Western watchers, is exactly what the
Chinese government fears religion may foster -- especially with
today's increasing unemployment and economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally in China there have been religious sects that have
arisen, especially in the countryside, and gathered a lot of people
and eventually moved to political ends,'' said Brent Fulton,
managing director of the Institute for Chinese Studies at Wheaton
College in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   The most infamous example was the 1850-64 Taiping Rebellion, led
by a charismatic Chinese who declared himself a brother to Jesus,
called by God to save China from the oppression of the Qing
Dynasty's Manchu rulers.
</P>
<P>
   His militant evangelism attracted legions of followers who
mounted civil war and took over much of central China. Only with
the aid of French and British forces did the Manchus finally quell
the uprising.
</P>
<P>
   Today, religion with political overtones particularly is
targeted in Tibet, where authorities suspect the exiled Dalai Lama
wants to return to lead Buddhist followers to independence. Muslim
activists in mountainous Xinjiang Province on the western border
are likewise monitored.
</P>
<P>
   Even in mainstream ethnic Chinese areas, however, deviation from
accepted religious lines spells trouble. From across the country
come reports of religious leaders being arrested or detained,
popular shrines shut down and worship sites trashed.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials maintain the charges of religious persecution,
including those made in the latest U.S. State Department Human
Rights Report, are wrong and even fabricated.
</P>
<P>
   Like the previous reports, they simply pieced together hearsay
and distorted information and used this material as the basis for
their report,'' Ye Xiao Wen, director general of China's Religious
Affairs Bureau said at a news conference in Washington this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese citizens' freedom of religious belief is guaranteed
under the constitution of China,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when three prominent American clergymen toured China this
year to assess the status of religion, a key question concerned the
fate of 30 Chinese religious leaders believed detained for reasons
of faith.
</P>
<P>
   Wheaton College's Fulton, who was in the delegation, said
authorities did not deny religious figures have been imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   They practiced religion outside the official sphere and that's
why they were arrested. The official version is they were causing
trouble or getting into political affairs,'' he said.

 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Here's how China's personality for the last two
millennia has been shaped by religions:
</P>
<P>
   200 B.C.-200 A.D. _ Imperial Confucianism. The human-centered
philosophy of the Chinese thinker Confucius (551-479 BC), who
stressed duty to the state and to ``moral behavior according to
status,'' is adopted by Chinese imperial rulers as a state
religion.
</P>
<P>
   1st Century A.D. _ Buddhism. The teachings of The Buddha, who
probably lived in Nepal in the 7th century B.C., are imported from
India and spread rapidly, eclipsing state Confucianism during the
golden age of Chinese Buddhism in the 5th-9th centuries A.D.
</P>
<P>
   2d-6th Century A.D. _ Daoism. A native mystical philosophy,
rooted in the wise sayings attributed to a Chinese hermit named Lao
Zi, thrives as an alternative to rigid Confucianism. It stresses
contemplation and ``dropping out,'' in contrast to Confucianism's
codes of duty to state and family elders.
</P>
<P>
   8th-9th Centuries A.D. _ Islam. Arabian camel caravans on the
Silk Road introduce the Muslim religion, which takes hold in
present-day Xinjiang province of western China and other ethnic
minority regions.
</P>
<P>
   16th Century A.D. _ Roman Catholicism. Jesuit priests enter
China, reach the imperial Ming Dynasty court and introduce
Christianity among the inner-most elite. Catholic missionaries
begin underground parishes, even though missionary work is
forbidden by the emperors.
</P>
<P>
   1807 _ Protestantism. Nearly 150 years of increasingly open
Christian proselytizing among Chinese begins as the first
Protestant missionary arrives from Britain.
</P>
<P>
   1843 _ Americans arrive. China opens its borders to American
Protestant missionaries, who are allowed to operate churches and
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   1850-64 __ Taiping Rebellion. Firebrand Chinese mystic draws
ethnic minorities and Chinese to his quasi-Christian revolt against
the Qing Dynasty's oppressive domination. British and French forces
help the Qing defeat rebels, who had nearly toppled the empire.
</P>
<P>
   1898-1901 _ Boxer Rebellion. Devotees of folk religion and
martial arts rise up against foreign influences, attacking
Christian missionaries and their converts. A foreign army of 20,000
U.S., British, Russian, Japanese and French troops enters China to
quell the uprising. Western missionary work expands.
</P>
<P>
   1949 _ Communist Suppression. All missionaries are expelled as
Lenin's atheism becomes the state religion. Some Christian churches
are forced to convert into state-controlled ``patriotic'' churches.
The rest are banned.
</P>
<P>
   1950-1960 _ Tibet Shackled. The People's Liberation Army enters
Tibet and gradually suppresses Tibetan nationalist resistance. The
Tibetan Buddhist leader, the Dalai Lama, escapes to exile in India
in March 1959. Chinese troops destroy monasteries and temples.
About one tenth of Tibet's population starve due to failed Chinese
agricultural policies of the ``Great Leap Forward'' (1959-60).
</P>
<P>
   1966-67 _ Cultural Revolution. Mao's Red Guard radicals destroy
Christian churches and arrest Chinese clergymen of the
``patriotic'' churches. Some congregations go underground, others
disband.
</P>
<P>
   1980s-90s _ Christian revival. With restrictions lightened, some
churches re-appear. Others remain underground as China continues to
ban those Roman Catholic churches with ties to the Vatican, as well
as unregistered Protestant parishes.
</P>
<P>
   August 1996 _ New pressure. With international tension
heightened over Taiwan, communist officials warn against foreign
forces using religion as a ``breakthrough point'' to ``westernize''
China. They put younger, more loyal clergymen in charge of the
official ``patriotic'' churches.
</P>
<P>
   1996-97 _ ``Feudal Superstition'' campaign. Worried at the
spread of folk religions in rural provinces, China destroys more
than 15,000 unregistered temples, churches and tombs. The Religious
Affairs Bureau bans building temples and outdoor Buddhas, saying
these flourished in areas ``controlled by sorcerers, witches and
professional superstitionalists.''

COMMENTARY: A ONE-MAN FEUD 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A few years ago Mark Green, the city's public
advocate, said the Police Department could save several million
dollars by redeploying cops who were assigned to auto maintenance
and janitorial duties. Those types of services could be privatized,
Green said.
</P>
<P>
   As Mayor Rudolph Giuliani considers himself more of an expert on
police matters than even his own police commissioners, the
suggestion was not received warmly. The mayor said Green's proposal
was ``idiotic.''
</P>
<P>
   In January 1995, an investigation by the public advocate's
office found that homeless women and children were being denied
housing assistance for which they were eligible. When Green issued
a report on those findings, the mayor denounced it as a ``cheap
shot.'' In fact, the report was accurate and the problems
continued.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1995, Giuliani administration officials refused to let
Green hold a press conference at a senior citizens center in an
Upper East Side Housing project.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter for The Daily News wrote: ``That forced dozens of
senior citizens who had invited Green to the Stanley Isaacs Senior
Center to leave their breakfasts and shuffle out to the sidewalk to
hear him and Boston Mayor Tom Menino discuss federal policy.''
</P>
<P>
   For a variety of reasons _ the biggest being the persistent
criticism of the administration _ Giuliani cannot abide Green.
Mention Mark Green to the mayor and you are very likely to get a
snide reply. It's as if his mere existence were irritating, and his
presence as the city's No. 2 officeholder intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has been trying to dream up ways to nuke the public
advocate's office, and thus throw Green out of work, since the
beginning of his first term as mayor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 the mayor tried to cripple the office with a draconian
23 percent budget cut. Peter Vallone, the speaker of the City
Council and no fan of the public advocate's office himself, balked.
So did four former mayors, David Dinkins, Ed Koch, Abe Beame and
John Lindsay. They all criticized the attempt. Said Koch: ``It's
unfair to single out one office and to cut it in a huge way when
others were not cut at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The budget reduction eventually was reduced by half. Nothing,
however, could save Green's parking space at City Hall. After 13
parking tickets, he gave up on what he thought was his right to
park there.
</P>
<P>
   Now the mayor is mounting his biggest offensive yet against the
office of the public advocate. He hopes, through his Charter
Revision Commission, to abolish it.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Powers, a former deputy mayor under Giuliani and the
chairman of the commission, mouthed the mayor's sentiments in a
recent television interview. ``A lot of people have suggested that
we don't need a public advocate anymore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Green had no reason to be surprised, and he wasn't. At the first
mention of charter change he knew his office would be targeted. As
he put it, ``When I saw this train coming down the track, I said,
`OK, Rudy's going to go for it.' I know how this guy operates.''
</P>
<P>
   Green, a candidate in the Democratic U.S. Senate primary, said
he plans an all-out defense of the public advocate's office.
Describing the mayor's actions as ``personal, political and
retaliatory,'' he said, ``I've never heard of a situation where the
No. 1 officeholder tries to eliminate the No. 2 officeholder in
midterm.''
</P>
<P>
   Frederick A.O. Schwarz Jr., chairman of the Charter Commission
that led to the current city government structure, explained on
Friday why he and his colleagues established the office of the
public advocate, which was essentially a continuation of the old
City Council president's office.
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``With a strong mayor, which the City Charter creates,
it was particularly important to have a number of checks and
balances to that mayoral power. And we thought the public advocate
was and would be an important element of the checks on that
power.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The mayor is extremely strong and the bureaucracy of
the mayoralty is very strong, so you need to have as much sunlight
thrown on that as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, headstrong, belligerent and resentful of any checks on
his power, disagrees. &QL;

COMMENTARY: ALL TRIPPED UP 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A friend of mine who knows Linda Tripp called to
see if I wanted to meet the Iago of Pentagon City.
</P>
<P>
   We could have dinner. Chat. Get to know each other in a relaxed
setting.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, dear readers, the prospect filled me with fear.
</P>
<P>
   Was Linda Tripp shopping for a new best girlfriend? And why me?
</P>
<P>
   When Kenneth Starr's whistleblower has her big moment before the
grand jury this week, she will chronicle her betrayal of her last
best girlfriend, who was horrified to find that Ms. Tripp had
secretly taped those desperate confidences about the Big Creep and
turned them over to the Little Creep.
</P>
<P>
   I imagined a rendezvous with Linda in a nocturnal alley with
cigarettes and fog and zither music. She would bring her wire; I
would bring my tape recorder.
</P>
<P>
   But I declined. The position of being Linda's girlfriend looked
too daunting. I knew she'd always be egging me on to do something
stupid _ sending a lovey-dovey tape to a man who couldn't care less
or treating Vernon Jordan like an employment agency.
</P>
<P>
   I decided it would be more prudent to keep up with her in the
media.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, the man who spent the most time proliferating gossip
about Ms. Tripp last week was the Rector of American Journalism,
James Fallows. The editor of U.S. News &AMP; World Report made the
rounds of the same TV talk shows he recently made a career of
deploring. He was flacking his magazine's account of more Monica
tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The noble, puritanical Fallows is now just another groveling,
pandering, sex-addled newsmagazine hack,'' laughed another
newsmagazine editor.
</P>
<P>
   The man who excoriated journalists for sinking into the muck of
scandals, rather than working with the government to solve public
policy problems, was now muck-sodden, hyping a story that featured
such revelations as: ``Tripp and Lewinsky discuss an incident in
which Lewinsky thought the president was becoming sexually aroused
when Lewinsky told him about her Defense Department trip to Bosnia
in July 1996.''
</P>
<P>
   (You know what it does to me when you say Sarajevo ...)
</P>
<P>
   Fallows tried to dignify his descent into tawdriness with some
high-minded fiddle-faddle. The story says its source ``had no
ideological or commercial motivation to favor the president, the
independent counsel, or any other party in the dispute.'' Surely
such a pure, disinterested, even-keeled leaker does not exist in
this city of vipers.
</P>
<P>
   He claimed his account of two hours of tape corrected the
distortions in Newsweek's edited transcript of 90 minutes. But
there are 20 hours of tape. And so there are still more than 16
hours of corrections to be made. Some scoop.
</P>
<P>
   At least Newsweek heard the tape, and gave readers a transcript.
We don't know what the U.S. News reporter was allowed to do. What
does ``reviewing the material'' mean? The reporter could not even
take notes as she ``reviewed.''
</P>
<P>
   Fallows said his story cast doubt on Starr's charge that the
president wanted to buy Monica's silence with a job, because on
these tapes Monica and Linda were talking about asking the
president for help two months before Monica was subpoenaed in the
Paula Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   But The New York Times and Newsweek reported long ago that
Monica had a job interview with then-U.N. delegate Bill Richardson,
arranged by the president's secretary in mid-October, two months
before Monica was subpoenaed in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   The big question persists: Where does a young, low-level
Pentagon employee making $30,000 a year get the gumption to demand
that the White House find her a job for $90,000 where she can do
``something easy'' _ as she says in the U.S. News article _ not
hard like media relations?
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. News story tries to support Clinton by suggesting the
press mistakenly characterized the tape Monica messengered to him
as erotic when it was romantic. On that cassette, the story says,
``She suggests that perhaps she and Clinton could have box dinners
and watch a movie, `tawk,' exchange a few hugs.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that the U.S. News material does not improve the
president's image. If anything, Monica seems even more egregiously
used.
</P>
<P>
   Brill. Fallows. On to next week's fetid buzz. &QL;

WHITE HOUSE AND RENO AT ODDS ON PRIVILEGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a striking disagreement over the Lewinsky
matter, the White House and the Justice Department have taken
significantly different legal positions in a federal appeals case
that will be argued next week over whether President Clinton can
invoke the attorney-client privilege to sharply limit the
questioning of one of his closest aides.
</P>
<P>
   Legal briefs unsealed by the appeals court late on Friday
disclosed an unusual rift between Clinton's White House lawyers and
Attorney General Janet Reno over the testimony of one of the
president's closest aides, Bruce Lindsey, the deputy White House
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The briefs disclose that the positions staked out for oral
arguments on Monday present the appeals court with a highly unusual
situation. Three entities _ the office of the president, the
Department of Justice and the independent counsel _ each of which
purport to be the voice of the executive branch in the case, have
put forward three competing views on the law on attorney-client
privilege for all federal agencies and officials.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are seeking to question Lindsey about his
conversations with the president and other witnesses as part of the
five-month inquiry into whether anyone committed perjury or
obstruction of justice concerning Clinton's relationship with
Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, argues that government
lawyers cannot invoke the privilege in criminal inquiries,
particularly because federal employees have an obligation under the
law to report evidence of crimes to the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   The president maintains that he enjoys an absolute privilege
that protects all of his conversations with government lawyers from
being disclosed to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   A brief signed by Reno for the Justice Department takes a middle
ground. It contends that in criminal inquiries, the president's
attorney-client privilege is a qualified one that can be pierced by
a federal judge who finds that the evidence being sought is
essential to the inquiry and is not available elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The distinction between the two positions articulated by the
Clinton administration, although subtle, is critical for both the
White House and the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers assert that the president, not the courts,
should be the final arbiter of whether Clinton can keep
conversations he has had with government lawyers confidential.
White House lawyers maintain that a qualified privilege is no real
privilege at all because Clinton would never be certain whether his
consultations with his lawyers would be kept confidential.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very essence of the protection afforded by an absolute
privilege is its predictability _ a quality that is of peculiar
importance in the case now before the court,'' the White House
contended in its brief.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Clinton faced the possibility of an impeachment
proceeding as a result of the Lewinsky inquiry, it added: ``The
president, in his official capacity, must be entitled to consult
with his official counsel on matters bearing on his official
responsibilities _ and on the defense of his constitutional status
as head of the executive branch. If he cannot do so with the
assurance that his conversations will be protected, he will be
disabled from securing the candid, frank legal advice to which he
is entitled _ disabled at the very moment that, under our
constitutional scheme, the president is in the greatest need of
such advice.''
</P>
<P>
   But Reno has replied that the courts alone are in the neutral
position to adequately weigh the needs of an investigation and
justice against the president's interest in candid and confidential
advice.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In most disputes between two federal agencies about the use of
the attorney-client privilege, the attorney general intervenes and
decides whether the privilege should be invoked or waived.
Typically, the privilege is waived in such situations.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department normally represents the interests of the
president in legal proceedings that involve issues like
attorney-client privilege or executive privilege. But early in the
Lewinsky inquiry, Reno decided to remove the department from
representing the president in those matters, suggesting that it
would be a conflict of interest because she had recommended
referring the Lewinsky matter to Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Justice Department ultimately decided to
intervene in the case and file a friend of the court brief because
of the institutional interests it has in the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's experience indicates that it would be
rare for the attorney general to strike the balance against
obtaining evidence, ``given the compelling federal interest in the
investigation of criminal inquiry,'' the department's brief said.
</P>
<P>
   But it added that, in inquiries involving independent counsels,
the attorney general and the president were in no position to weigh
the merits of such claims of privilege and that the independent
counsel was in no position to consider the institutional concerns
of the office of the president in keeping certain matters
confidential.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal involves a decision last month by Judge Norma
Holloway Johnson of U.S. District Court that Clinton enjoys only a
qualified privilege that is outweighed by the needs of
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department brief generally supported that ruling,
although it said that Judge Johnson should have applied a
``heightened standard'' before she ultimately ruled against
Clinton. The standard proposed by the Justice Department is that
the material being sought should be found to be ``essential to the
justice of the case'' or ``demonstrably critical'' to the grand
jury's inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The brief filed by Starr has not been unsealed, but the Justice
Department and White House criticize each other's position in their
court papers.
</P>
<P>
   The White House brief, written by Neil Eggleston, a former White
House lawyer now in private practice, said that the Justice
Department ``confuses two analytically distinct questions, and
arrives at an incorrect result.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The department's proposed approach reaches a result
inconsistent with the unbroken common-law authorities holding the
privilege, once asserted, is absolute and not subject to
balancing,'' the White House brief said.

ASSEMBLY VOTE REALIGNS NORTHERN IRELAND LOYALTIES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By WARREN HOGE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ New alliances emerged Saturday in
the aftermath of Northern Ireland Assembly election, with the
British province's largest Catholic and Protestant parties turning
away from old divisions to unite in support of the fragile peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   The vote produced a clear endorsement of the new assembly, the
centerpiece of the peace settlement reached on April 10. But it
also laid bare a strong challenge from within the Protestant
movement to one of its key players, David Trimble, head of the
Ulster Unionist Party and the presumed speaker of the new body.
Many members of his party deserted him and voted for candidates
opposed to sharing power with Catholics in the new legislature.
</P>
<P>
   John Hume, leader of the moderate Catholic Social Democratic and
Labor Party, rushed in to try to shore up support for Trimble.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this election,'' he said, ``it is quite clear that David
Trimble and his party have done very, very well indeed. And when
you add up his votes and the SDLP vote and the votes of the parties
that are in favor of the agreement, it's very strong and very clear
and therefore the circumstances for working together now are
certainly a lot better than they looked, given the noise of the
`no' campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Alban Maginness, another Social Democratic and Labor Party
winner and the first Catholic ever to be lord mayor of Belfast,
appeared on a television panel with Trimble on Saturday morning and
said, ``We want to see a new type of politics in Northern Ireland,
the politics of cooperation, and I think the Ulster Unionists agree
with that type of approach.''
</P>
<P>
   With 92 of the 108 seats decided and the ballot count from
Thursday's election continuing into Saturday evening, the BBC
forecast a final total of 29 seats for Trimble's party; 25 for
Hume's; 21 for the anti-agreement Democratic Unionists of the Rev.
Ian Paisley; 18 for Sinn Fein, the Irish Republican Army's
political wing headed by Gerry Adams; six for the cross-community
Alliance Party; four for the UK Unionists of Robert McCartney, a
Paisley ally, and five for other, smaller parties.
</P>
<P>
   In the most critical measure of the new divide that seems to
have replaced the sectarian schism in Northern Irish politics, 80
of the winners were supporters of the peace accord and 28 were
opponents. That figure was two shy of the number Paisley and his
followers needed to carry out their threat to block steps in the
assembly called for in the peace accord, though it insured what
Trimble called ``a bumpy ride.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, the product of 26 months of negotiations in
Belfast, sets up a number of councils intended to balance opposing
desires: the Catholics' wishes to form a closer association with
the Republic of Ireland, and the Protestants' to remain part of
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-agreement campaign, led by the firebrand Paisley and
aided by dissidents within Trimble's party, made significant
inroads into Trimble's support.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Northern Ireland have written the obituary
notice of Trimbleism,'' Paisley exulted after the vote. ``I believe
it is the end of his leadership of anything in Northern Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams, whose party increased its vote total from past elections,
said that he ``appreciated David Trimble's difficulties'' and that
he thought the fracturing of the Unionist vote was ``regrettable.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Trimble's longtime refusal to speak to him, Adams,
who will now become a minister in the new Northern Ireland
government, sounded conciliatory. Trimble, he said, ``has a place
on this island, and it should be an honorable place and an honored
place, and he has to accept that I have to be treated on the basis
of equality.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the winners were men who once committed acts of sectarian
violence but have since become some of the most passionate backers
of a negotiated peace. They included Gerry Kelly, the man convicted
in an IRA bombing of a London court building that killed one person
and wounded 250.
</P>
<P>
   There were also the leaders of the Progressive Unionist Party:
Billy Hutchinson, a former Protestant paramilitary gunman with two
murder convictions, and David Ervine, who spent five years in jail
for possession of explosives.
</P>
<P>
   The first meeting of the assembly is to take place Wednesday in
the same conference hall where peace negotiations were held. The
principal order of business will be to select a first minister,
most likely Trimble, and his deputy, probably Hume.
</P>
<P>
   There will be discussion on whether the assembly should make its
permanent home in the neoclassical Stormont Palace, which housed
the old legislature famously described by its first speaker in 1922
as ``a Protestant Parliament for a Protestant people.'' Catholics
have long associated that body, and its limestone building full of
heroic Unionist paintings and statuary, with Protestant domination
of the province.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, the assembly adjourns until the fall. It is
expected to receive its powers to legislate early in the new year.
</P>
<P>
   Before then it will form cross-border groups to bring together
ministers from the new Northern Ireland government with their
counterparts in the government of Ireland in Dublin. It is this
process that the anti-agreement campaigners have vowed to
frustrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything in the assembly that is likely to lead us closer to
the Republic of Ireland, we will block, we will vote against and we
will endeavor to stop,'' pledged Gregory Campbell, Paisley's
lieutenant in Londonderry. &QL;

TRIPP TO TELL GRAND JURY OF TAPE RECORDINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They have heard her voice for months, but on
Tuesday morning, the 23 men and women serving on a federal grand
jury here will finally meet Linda Tripp. As the Pentagon employee
explains why she chose to betray a friend, the grand jurors will
have an opportunity to weigh her motives and credibility by looking
in her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   It was Mrs. Tripp's surreptitious taping of Monica Lewinsky's
conversations that began an independent counsel's investigation
into President Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, a one-time
White House intern. Now, Mrs. Tripp will tell the grand jury
whether she was seeking to protect the truth, as she has
maintained, or hoping to exploit a sensational tale to write a
tell-all book, as her critics have suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps as much as any single piece of evidence, Mrs. Tripp's
story _ and how the grand jury reacts to it _ could determine the
fate of the inquiry by Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel. Her
much-anticipated testimony comes at a critical moment in the
investigation, as Starr's office has been negotiating with Ms.
Lewinsky's new legal team on an immunity deal. If a deal falls
through, Ms. Lewinsky could soon face indictment and Mrs. Tripp
would become the star witness against her.
</P>
<P>
   That would make Mrs. Tripp's credibility and motives
particularly important and sure to come under fierce attack by Ms.
Lewinsky's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   In public statements, Mrs. Tripp has insisted that she recorded
some of her conversations with Ms. Lewinsky to corroborate the
truth about her friend's sexual relationship with the president in
case she was called to testify in the Paula Corbin Jones civil
lawsuit against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linda is ready to tell the truth about the facts as she knows
them,'' said Anthony Zaccagnini, Mrs. Tripp's lawyer. ``She is
anxious to get this over and behind her so that she can move on
with her life.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the grand jurors have formed their impressions of
Mrs. Tripp by listening to excerpts of nearly 20 hours of
conversations she secretly recorded last autumn with Ms. Lewinsky,
whom she befriended when the intern was transferred to the Pentagon
from the White House. According to lawyers familiar with the
inquiry, the grand jury has heard Mrs. Tripp urge Ms. Lewinsky to
tell the lawyers in the Jones sexual harassment case the truth
about her relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the grand jurors, the public has been privy to only a
handful of quotations from about four hours of Mrs. Tripp's tapes,
and those tend to cast her in a negative light. In snippets of
their conversations published in two weekly news magazines, Mrs.
Tripp is portrayed as having manipulated Ms. Lewinsky's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But the most important tape has not been heard outside the grand
jury room, nor has it been disclosed publicly. That is the
recording made by Starr's prosecutors of Mrs. Tripp's meeting with
Ms. Lewinsky on Jan. 13, four days before Clinton denied under oath
in the Jones lawsuit that he had ever had sexual relations with Ms.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   On that two-and-a-half-hour tape, made at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel
in Pentagon City, Va., a suburb of Washington, Ms. Lewinsky makes
statements ``damaging'' to Clinton and his longtime friend, Vernon
Jordan, according to two people who have listened to it.
</P>
<P>
   Over an afternoon snack of tea and cookies, Mrs. Tripp asks Ms.
Lewinsky to describe her conversations with Jordan about finding a
job, as well as her conversations with the president.
</P>
<P>
   In an anguished voice that at times borders on ``hysterical,''
Ms. Lewinsky herself insists that she feels she must ``deny'' she
had a relationship with Clinton, and she repeatedly urges Mrs.
Tripp to deny any knowledge of it, too, the two people said. (More
than once, Mrs. Tripp refuses to lie about their relationship and
says she plans to tell the truth.)
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, Ms. Lewinsky says that she would deny her
relationship with Clinton in a signed affidavit in the Jones
lawsuit only if she obtains a lucrative job with the help of
Jordan, according to one of the two people.
</P>
<P>
   The Ritz-Carlton tape was used by Starr's prosecutors to
persuade Attorney General Janet Reno to authorize an expansion of
Starr's investigation to include an inquiry into whether the
president committed perjury or obstructed justice. Since late
January, the grand jury here has examined whether Clinton or anyone
else urged Ms. Lewinsky to lie to the Jones lawyers, and whether
efforts to find her a job were meant to insure her silence.
</P>
<P>
   Both Clinton and Jordan have denied that they told Ms. Lewinsky
or anyone else to lie.

</P>
<P>
   In an article this week in U.S. News &AMP; World Report, which
reviewed two hours of tapes, Mrs. Tripp comes across as a
manipulative, overbearing woman who tries to guide and shape Ms.
Lewinsky's answers through leading questions.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine said, for example, that Mrs. Tripp ``appears to
encourage Lewinsky's obsession'' with the president, telling her on
the tapes that she should insist to Betty Currie, the president's
secretary, that she must see the president. And it said that on
parts of the tapes, Mrs. Tripp ``also seems to be encouraging
Lewinsky to ask the president for a job.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. News account supports the impression, conveyed in a
lengthy article two weeks ago in Brill's Content, a new magazine on
the media, that publication of the scandal was orchestrated by Mrs.
Tripp and Lucianne Goldberg, a New York literary agent, with the
help of Michael Isikoff, a Newsweek correspondent.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining that Isikoff wanted tangible evidence beyond the
tapes to verify a presidential affair, Ms. Goldberg is quoted in
the article as saying: ``We told Linda to suggest that Monica use a
courier service to send love letters to the president. And we told
her what courier service to use. Then we told (Isikoff) to call the
service'' to ask for receipts.
</P>
<P>
   To Mrs. Tripp's legal team, it is not a coincidence that an
unflattering portrait of Mrs. Tripp emerged not long before her
scheduled appearance before the grand jury. They say they believe
it represents an effort by the president's defenders to malign Mrs.
Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about Mrs. Tripp's motives had been raised before,
usually by the president's defenders. In 1996, they point out, Mrs.
Tripp was trying to write a book about the Clinton scandals with
Ms. Goldberg, who has made no secret of her anti-Clinton bias. Mrs.
Tripp's working title for her book was ``Behind Closed Doors: What
I Saw at the Clinton White House.'' Her working nom de plume was
``Joan Dean,'' after John Dean, the aide in the Nixon White House.
</P>
<P>
   Although the tapes that have been made public seem to reinforce
the impression that Mrs. Tripp had ulterior motives, people who
have heard all 20 hours of the tapes say that this is a
misimpression. Like any smattering of verbal exchanges between two
people, the quotes published so far do not completely reflect the
complexity of the women's relationship, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these quotes are taken out of context,'' said another
person who has heard most of the tapes. ``It is impossible to
understand their whole relationship by looking at an hour or two
hours of conversations, which amount to nothing more than 1 percent
of all their conversations about the subject.''
</P>
<P>
   The person said, ``These women talked about this for hundreds of
hours; it's all they talked about.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr has tried to corroborate the details in the tape-recorded
conversations between Mrs. Tripp and Ms. Lewinsky. According to
lawyers familiar with the inquiry, Starr's prosecutors have gone to
great lengths to confirm almost everything said on the tapes,
including going to court to fight for the right to subpoena records
of Ms. Lewinsky's book purchases. On tape, Ms. Lewinsky talks about
buying books for Clinton, including ``Vox,'' a novel by Nicholson
Baker about phone sex.
</P>
<P>
   Since her name has become a household word, Mrs. Tripp has
stayed mostly out of the public eye. She has spent many hours
preparing for her grand jury appearance, which had originally been
scheduled for the first week of June, but was called off at the
last minute after Ms. Lewinsky dismissed her original lawyer,
William Ginsburg, and hired the Washington lawyers Plato Cacheris
and Jacob Stein.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp released just one public statement, in late January,
when she insisted that she made the recordings to protect her
reputation after Robert Bennett, the president's personal lawyer,
declared last summer, ``Linda Tripp should not be believed.'' In an
August 1997 issue of Newsweek, Mrs. Tripp had described seeing a
White House volunteer, Kathleen Willey, leave the Oval Office after
Ms. Willey claimed she had fended off an unwanted sexual advance by
the president.
</P>
<P>
   It was Bennett's challenge to her credibility that inspired Mrs.
Tripp to make the tape recordings of her talks with Ms. Lewinsky,
an account she is prepared to tell the grand jury on Tuesday
morning, her friends say. To her, the grand jury appearance,
expected to last three days, represents the opportunity to set the
record straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there have been unfair characterizations,'' one friend
said this week about the most recent tape recordings made public.
``We always anticipated that the White House spin would be a
40-some-year-old woman has exercised too much control over a
24-year-old girl.''

ETHICS PANEL URGES EASING OF RESTRICTIONS ON AIDS VACCINES 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Responding to impassioned pleas from developing
countries desperately seeking a vaccine to fight the AIDS epidemic,
an ethics panel convened by the United Nations is recommending
major changes in the way experimental vaccines are tested in
people.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier guidelines, intended to prevent exploitation, called for
testing any experimental AIDS vaccine in the country where it was
made before testing it in a developing country.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday, after a two-day meeting, the panel recommended
that such trials be allowed to take place in any country, including
those in the Third World, even if not first tested in the
manufacturer's country.
</P>
<P>
   The old guidelines were having the unintended effect of impeding
possible vaccine trials in many developing countries, said panel
members from developing countries like Zambia, Thailand and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are asking for more flexibility in the guidelines right
now,'' said Sophia Mukasa Monico, director of an AIDS support
organization in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting a widespread view on the panel that American ethical
standards should not be imposed on developing countries during an
epidemic, Maj. Rubaramira Ruranga, from a research center in
Kampala, Uganda, asked rhetorically, ``Who should be a guinea pig
for whom?
</P>
<P>
   ``What is ethical in one place is not always what is ethical in
another,'' Ruranga said. Each day, he pointed out, 16,000 people
worldwide become infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, and
90 percent of them are in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions came at what Dr. Peter Piot, the head of the
U.N. AIDS Program, said was the first international meeting on the
ethics of AIDS vaccines. The United Nations has sponsored six
regional meetings on the issue during the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's actions are expected to be largely adopted by the
U.N. AIDS Program and thus by researchers worldwide. They represent
a shift from older attitudes of paternalism and protectiveness to
greater empowerment by developing countries and a victory over what
leaders in such countries regard as cultural imperialism, Piot
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in Africa are not as ignorant as they were 10 to 20
years ago, and they know their rights,'' said Dr. Nkandu Luo, the
minister of health for Zambia.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the past, drug companies and scientists have conducted
research on people in the Third World that led to development of
drugs that were not made readily available to people in the
countries where the research was done. In allowing the first trials
of a vaccine to take place in developing countries, the panel said,
the host country had to have adequate scientific and administrative
ability to avoid harm to volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   To help guard against exploitation, the panel called for
requiring informed consent from each individual before that person
is enrolled in a vaccine trial. The new recommendation could end a
widespread practice of allowing a village chief or local leader to
give blanket approval for the participation in vaccine trials of
all those living in a village.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations come four days after a report from the U.N.
AIDS Program, saying that in certain areas of Africa one in four
adults is infected with HIV. The recommendations also follow widely
publicized controversies involving U.S.-sponsored human trials of
drugs aimed at stopping mother-to-infant transmission of HIV in
Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has called for development of a vaccine
against HIV by 2007. So far, at least 25 vaccines have been tested
in humans in the first of the three-stage testing process required
before the federal Food and Drug Administration will license a
vaccine. Only three have reached the second stage.
</P>
<P>
   Tests of the only HIV vaccine to go into full-scale testing
began recently in the United States and full-scale testing is
expected to begin later this year in Thailand, which has a high
rate of HIV infection. Many scientists say they have little hope,
however, that the vaccine will protect large percentages of
recipients against HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Results of vaccine trials generally come faster and require
fewer participants when they are conducted in a country with a
higher incidence of new infections. Thus, trials in the most
heavily infected countries like Botswana and Zimbabwe would yield
results more quickly than trials in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, which includes more than 100 health officials and
experts on AIDS, vaccines, law and ethics, also recommended that
the use of a dummy vaccine, or placebo, be considered ethical in a
trial of an HIV vaccine, as long as no effective vaccine exists.
</P>
<P>
   The panel urged the disqualification of people who are not able
to give adequately informed consent because of mental or behavioral
disorders. The panel did not specify how a prospective volunteer's
mental status would be determined.
</P>
<P>
   A major issue has been whether drug companies and governments
have an obligation to treat participants who become HIV-infected
during a trial, either because the vaccine was not fully protective
or because they were infected before the vaccine took effect.
</P>
<P>
   Some argue that sponsors of vaccine trials are ethically obliged
to treat an infected participant with a combination drug therapy
for life. Others say such treatment in the early stage of infection
is not proved to be necessary and is too expensive for many
developing countries. Some officials from those countries contend
that it is cultural imperialism to impose American medical
standards for treatment on their countries.
</P>
<P>
   The panel accepted a proposal from Dr. Ruth Macklin, an ethicist
at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, about what
drugs and care to provide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision about what to provide to participants who become
HIV-infected in the course of a vaccine trial should be left to the
individual countries participating in a trial,'' she said. ``But in
any case that standard should be no lower than the highest
practical standard of care in that country.''
</P>
<P>
   Piot said in an interview that he planned to accept the
recommendations allowing first tests of a vaccine in developing
countries and requiring informed consent from each individual, and
would withhold judgment on other recommendations until a draft is
submitted to his office. &QL;

   With CHINA-RELIGION-$ADV28 _ BEIJING _ Sunday evening in the
candlelit sanctuary of Dong Tang, a ``patriotic'' Catholic church,
a four-year-old Chinese girl in a frilly dress sang the memorized
words of a hymn with as much gusto as the adults around her. More
than 200 worshipers chanted alleluias, partook holy communion and
heard of miraculous events at the Sermon on the Mount. Elderly men,
young couples, three sweaty teens in baggy pants -- basketball in
tow -- filled two-thirds of the pews last week. The
Chinese-language service looked much like a mass in America. But
the priest could not mention Catholicism's most revered living
figure, Pope John Paul II, or even whisper a reference to an issue
central to the church worldwide: the stand against abortion. And
fortunately for the four-year-old's mother, no hard-line Chinese
authorities were in Dong Tang (East Church) that night looking for
violators of government mandates, because it is forbidden to spread
religion to anyone under 18. These are the kinds of restrictions
advocates of human rights hope President Bill Clinton's visit today
to a Beijing Protestant church will spotlight. (Kunstel, Cox News

<P>
   EL BOSQUE, Mexico _ The mayor of this country town in the
southern state of Chiapas should be a happy man. Instead he is in
anguish.
</P>
<P>
   On June 10, the state governor ordered hundreds of police and
army troops to storm El Bosque and recapture the town hall from
supporters of the Zapatista rebels who had seized it two years ago,
ousted Mayor Ramon Gonzalez Sanchez and set up their own parallel
administration. The troops arrested the self-appointed Zapatista
officials and reinstated Gonzalez, who is from the government's
party.
</P>
<P>
   But 10 people _ two police officers and eight Indian villagers
who back the Zapatistas _ were killed that day in the military
operations here and in outlying hamlets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never wanted this to happen,'' Gonzalez said remorsefully.
``For me it is not right for Indians to fight with other Indians.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Gonzalez, Mexico as a whole is reeling in the aftermath of
the violence in El Bosque. It was the first time that Zapatista
militias had fired back at government troops since a cease-fire
went into effect in Chiapas more than three years ago. In two El
Bosque hamlets there were prolonged gun battles between government
forces and Zapatista militias, even though the rebels were vastly
outnumbered and outgunned.
</P>
<P>
   The episode showed both Mexicans and international observers how
volatile the civil conflict in Chiapas has become and how far
President Ernesto Zedillo has moved toward open military
confrontation with the Zapatista rebels, more than four years after
the Indian guerrillas first emerged with a brief New Year's Day
uprising.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, the former president of Ireland who is now the U.N.
high commissioner for human rights, said there might have been
``serious violations of the rights of indigenous people'' in the El
Bosque episode and called for the peace talks to resume.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright also made a rare
reference to Chiapas at a recent Senate hearing, saying the United
States was ``pressing'' Mexico to resolve the situation. The
comment set off a diplomatic tempest as the government hotly
rejected any American pressure in what it regards as a purely
domestic issue.
</P>
<P>
   The violence came only days after the peace negotiations reached
their low point, when the bishop of Chiapas, Samuel Ruiz Garcia,
resigned as mediator.
</P>
<P>
   The operation at El Bosque was the fourth in a series of
government military actions since April to dismantle what the
Zapatistas call their ``autonomous'' town governments and to
reinstate officials belonging to the government's party, the
Institutional Revolutionary Party.
</P>
<P>
   The Zapatistas began two years ago to set up the alternative
governments in Indian towns where they are popular, after they
signed a partial peace agreement with the government. The agreement
laid the groundwork for the Zapatistas to evolve from a clandestine
organization of armed guerrillas into a peaceful political
movement. It also established the foundations for greater legal
autonomy for Indian communities across Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The partial accords were never officially carried out because of
differences between the government and the Zapatistas over how to
put them into effect. Late in 1996 the peace talks collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   But the Zapatistas went ahead and acted on the accords by
asserting their political control and setting up ``autonomous''
governments in communities across the Indian regions of Chiapas
where their followers predominate.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Zapatistas boycotted the national
elections last July, even though Mexico's electoral system
underwent a major reform and Mexicans elsewhere were expressing
their views at the polls with unprecedented enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1997 tensions exploded between entrenched
authorities of the government's party and insurgent pro-Zapatista
organizations. In the Indian township of Chenalho, gunmen allied
with the government's party killed 45 unarmed Zapatista
sympathizers in one hillside hamlet. Zedillo concluded from the
massacre that the federal government had lost control in the Indian
communities of Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   He and the Chiapas governor, Roberto Albores Guillen, a member
of the president's party, declared the Zapatista towns to be in
violation of the Mexican Constitution and attempted to subdue them
by force.
</P>
<P>
   In El Bosque both factions _ followers of the president's party
and the Zapatistas _ have some weapons. Festering disputes over
land ownership and power have flared into angry rivalries since
1994.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two months Chiapas police reported three ambushes of
government supporters on roads in El Bosque by armed and masked
assailants. The Zapatistas contended that the government supporters
were feuding among themselves, but police said the attackers were
Zapatistas.
</P>
<P>
   In the third ambush, on June 9, one government supporter was
killed and five were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Albores seized on the episode to send in more than 1,000 police
and army troops. They occupied the town hall in El Bosque and
arrested the Zapatista authorities. They also went to two hamlets,
Chavajeval and Union Progreso, carrying arrest warrants for
Zapatista villagers accused of murder in the earlier ambushes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In El Bosque, Gonzalez said he had been asking the state
government for two years to help him regain his place in the town
hall. But he said he had learned to live with two administrations
in the town, one for the government's followers and one for
Zapatistas. Gonzalez said he was not consulted about the military
operation and felt uneasy about resuming his office in its wake.
</P>
<P>
   In Chavajeval, a village down a rocky road surrounded by steep
promontories, the villagers, still frightened, said local women
went out to block the road to prevent the troops from entering.
Police fired tear gas at them, prompting a small squad of Zapatista
militia members to fire their semiautomatic rifles. The army used
mortars and strafed the village from helicopters during the
firefight, which lasted several hours.
</P>
<P>
   After the shooting stopped, the villagers said, they fled and
the soldiers ransacked their homes looking for weapons. Many homes
were destroyed and radios and farm tools were stolen.
</P>
<P>
   In Union Progreso, villagers said the troops fed themselves
after the operation by slaughtering most of the villagers'
chickens.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities returned six bodies to Union Progreso last week.
But they were so disfigured by crude autopsies that they were
unrecognizable, the villagers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still don't know who died here,'' said Mario Sanchez, a
villager, noting that some Zapatista militia members there on the
day of the fighting were from other villages.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 22 villagers from the two hamlets have been jailed and
indicted on charges of homicide and rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Albores defended the operation, contending that it had averted
greater bloodshed. ``We prevented a conflagration between the
communities in which many more lives would have been lost,'' he
said in a television interview.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo went to Chiapas two days after the violence to promise
that the government was not seeking to renew hostilities with the
Zapatistas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am one of those who are convinced that violence doesn't lead
us to anything good,'' Zedillo said. But he said the government
would try to stem violence on all sides by enforcing ``respect for
the law.''
</P>
<P>
   The 33 Zapatista townships responded to Zedillo's calls for
renewed dialogue with a terse communique: ``Zedillo, you are a
murderer. That's all.'' &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Humidity will be noticeably lower than on recent days east of
the Appalachians from northern Virginia to New England. Sunshine
will be ample in much of the region. However, a stalled front from
the interior Middle Atlantic States to eastern Great Lakes will be
the focus for clusters of clouds and some thundershowers. The
showers will gradually move toward the northeast late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Hot and very humid weather will persist over most of the
Southeast and Middle West as high pressure remains strong near the
southern Appalachians. Onshore winds will promote bands of tropical
showers with locally heavy rain from northeastern Texas to the
southernmost Mississippi Valley. Isolated thunderstorms will form
in Florida but no widespread rain is expected in the fire-plagued
areas over the northern part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Searing heat and bright sunshine with temperatures at or near
record levels will continue over large parts of the southern and
central Plains. Farther north, a few potent thunderstorms with high
winds and hail will form Sunday evening near a front from eastern
Nebraska to the western Great Lakes. The Northern Plains will be
mainly dry in the wake of the front.
</P>
<P>
   The abnormally cool air that has been over the Northwest will
begin to recede Sunday. A few showers will linger over the hilly
terrain of northern Montana and Idaho. Otherwise, after a cool
dawn, plentiful sunshine will boost afternoon readings to near
seasonal levels. Meanwhile, the Southwest will be sunny and hot as
high pressure expands over the region.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Hazy Days
</P>
<P>
   The haze that has reduced visibility during the recent spate of
heat in the Northeast is not just pollution, and it occurs even in
the cleanest environments of the polar regions. Haze is most often
found in the middle latitudes in summer when the winds aloft become
very light. The weak winds allow for considerable vertical mixing
of the lower atmosphere with very little horizontal movement. As a
result, dust, pollen and pollutants are carried higher into the air
than usual. Humid air can contain numerous suspended water droplets
that adhere to the tiny solid particles and thicken the haze.

UNPAID U.N DUES COULD COST U.S. ITS VOTE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 
   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The United States could lose its vote in the
General Assembly unless it comes up with $211 million to $241
million more than it now expects to pay in U.N. dues and
assessments this year, according to a new U.S. government estimate.
</P>
<P>
   The warning appears in a new study by the General Accounting
Office on the U.N.'s financial problems and the arrears owed by the
United States. The study was requested by members of Congress, some
of whom have expressed skepticism about how much the United States
owes the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The government study gratified U.N. officials because it
recognizes the financial problems created by the United States and
other nations that are behind on their dues and backs up the basic
figures used by the world organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report is important for what it says,'' said Joseph.
Connor, the U.N. undersecretary for management. ``And what it says
is that the regular budget deficit is growing, that peacekeeping
cash is declining, that the total resources available to the
organization are diminishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Connor said that the United Nations kept itself afloat by
raiding its peacekeeping budget, postponing payments to troop
contributors and commercial suppliers and resorting to other
financially imprudent measures.
</P>
<P>
   The report barely touches on the influence that the United
States has lost at the United Nations by not paying its bills.
</P>
<P>
   Its power has not eroded in the Security Council, which is more
important than the General Assembly and where the debates often
entail issues of war and peace.
</P>
<P>
   But at other levels, said Richard Sklar, the U.S. delegate
responsible for reform and management issues, ``our influence is
plummeting through the floor every day.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that when he proposes economies to other delegates they
say: ``What right do you have to talk to us? You're a deadbeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Primarily because of its arrears, the United States lost its
seat on a key committee that advises the General Assembly on
administrative and budget questions. The loss of its General
Assembly vote could come in January.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said that members currently owe $977
million for the regular 1998 budget. The United States, as the
organization's largest contributor, accounts for nearly two-thirds
of the total arrears.
</P>
<P>
   As of June 15, the United Nations reported that the United
States owed about $1.5 billion in dues and assessments, while the
United States says it owes a little over $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has balked at paying an expanded assessment for
peacekeeping, has withheld money for some projects that it
considers wasteful or biased, and disputes the amount of tax that
the United Nations pays for American employees in its tax
equalization program.
</P>
<P>
   Article 19 of the U.N. Charter stipulates that a member nation
will have no General Assembly vote if the amount it owes exceeds
its contributions for the previous two years.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office said that projected payments by
Congress this year would still leave a shortfall of $211 million to
$241 million. And Congress has yet to send President Clinton
legislation this year appropriating funds for the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   As of May 11, 27 U.N. members had forfeited their votes because
their arrears exceeded what they paid in the previous two years.
The General Assembly can allow a member to vote if failure to pay
is deemed beyond its control. Comoros, Liberia and Tajikistan have
such an exception.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, China, France and Russia kept their vote in the
General Assembly after they refused to pay some assessments. But
the chronic indebtedness of the United States is so resented by
other, less prosperous countries, and even by its allies, that a
showdown looks likely unless Congress finds the extra money. &QL;

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Not so long ago, Mexico seemed a reasonably safe
place, especially when compared with Latin American societies in
the throes of civil war or paramilitary violence. But that's
changed. Now virtually every day, terrifying new crimes dramatize
the country's public security crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Just in recent weeks, a Vermont artist was knifed to death on a
Pacific Coast beach. A kidnapper called a Mexico City newspaper to
boast about hacking off the ears of his hostages and to jeer at the
authorities' inability to stop him. Military police ordered to
investigate the disappearance of scores of people in a city on the
Texas border were themselves arrested collecting a kidnapping
ransom. The State Department has cautioned visiting Americans about
the rising crime rates.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican criminologists, sociologists and others are debating
what's gone wrong. How did one of the safest countries in the
hemisphere become a place where tourists are panicking and millions
fear criminal attack whenever they leave home?
</P>
<P>
   Some blame the economy, which for 15 years has seen real wages
fall and the breach between rich and poor widen. Some cite
sociology, saying that an entire generation of police officers are
now using their violent skills as participants in organized crime.
Others trace the crisis to the justice system, which is so
discredited that most crimes go unreported, fewer are investigated,
and only a tiny fraction of the perpetrators are ever punished.
</P>
<P>
   Some even blame the growth of democracy, which by stripping
Mexico's ruling party of many of its authoritarian powers has also
diminished its ability to repress crime.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is common to all these explanations. There is a sense
that Mexico's top civilian authorities have lost control of the
country's criminals, who now see lucrative opportunities on all
sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``In practical terms, the Mexican state simply doesn't respond
to most crimes,'' said Ernesto Lopez Portillo, co-author of a 1994
study of public security issues. ``The authorities refuse to
recognize the severity of the public security crisis, partly
because it's so frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   The facts are sobering. Although record-keeping is chaotic, and
fear of police keeps many victims from reporting crimes, government
statistics for Mexico City show that reported murders rose by 50
percent from 1990 to 1995 and that robbery incidents have
multiplied six-fold in 15 years. Experts estimate that kidnappings
in Mexico, once rare, now number at least 1,500 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Ruiz Harrell, a professor who is one of Mexico's most
meticulous crime statisticians, has charted annual figures for all
reported crimes since 1930 and concluded: ``There's a clear
association between economic crisis and crime.''
</P>
<P>
   For 50 years after 1930, Mexican workers enjoyed an almost
uninterrupted rise in their standard of living, and in those years,
he says, crime declined with equal constancy, even though Mexican
wages remained far below the standard in the United States. But
beginning in 1983, the first year after an economic crisis sent
wages into free-fall, crime rates took off, and they have yet to
level out. In 1995, the year following a disastrous peso
devaluation, reported crimes in Mexico surged 35 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never before in our history has crime grown this rapidly,''
Ruiz said. ``The figures speak for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Economic determinism has its critics, however, including
President Ernesto Zedillo. In an appearance in June in New York,
Zedillo said that attributing street crime to economic factors
amounts to blaming the poor. Instead, he said, the problem lies
with the ``inefficiency'' of Mexico's crime-fighting institutions.
</P>
<P>
   How do inefficient police and prosecutors translate into more
crime? ``Potential criminals act rationally and base their decision
to commit a crime on an analysis of costs and benefits,'' said a
recent World Bank study of crime in Latin America. Potential
criminals, it said, estimate the payoff of a crime, the costs
associated with committing it, and the probability of punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Those who apply this calculus in Mexico see that crimes like
kidnapping and drug trafficking have proven extremely lucrative in
recent years, and punishment is rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Mexico as elsewhere, crime is a career option that competes
with others,'' said Lopez. Many Mexicans are turning to crime
because punishment is remote. The criminal justice system is
chaotic; the country has had seven attorney generals in nine years,
and turnover among lower officials is higher. Given the disorder,
Lopez estimated that of each 100 crimes reported to authorities,
only five are investigated.
</P>
<P>
   But Mexico's justice system has never worked efficiently, so why
is crime surging now? Until recently, Lopez said, government
officials from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, known
as the PRI, controlled the criminal class, often favoring one mafia
in exchange for kickbacks while suppressing rival groups and never
allowing crime to surpass certain bounds. But as the PRI has begun
to share power, it has lost control of the criminals, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old rules no longer apply and new ones haven't emerged,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lucio Mendoza, a former analyst at the national security agency
who now runs a research organization, said the authorities have not
only lost control but that members of the police are now the main
organizers of crime.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in the late 1960s, he said, successive presidents gave
the police, especially members of an elite corps known as the
Federal Security Directorate, license to eliminate accused
subversives by whatever means they felt necessary. By the early
1980s guerrillas had been suppressed, and the police turned their
extralegal skills to organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a cancer that expanded,'' Mendoza said. ``They
went into drugs, car theft, kidnaps, piracy, truck hijackings. This
is the cause of the crime rates we see today.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a recent newsletter, Mendoza cited 39 articles published in
major Mexican newspapers between May 22 and June 9, each detailing
spectacular police criminality.
</P>
<P>
   One said Mexico City police officers, using a government
computer, were identifying and then threatening citizens who report
crime. Another reported the arrest of 11 police officers who were
trafficking in migrant workers in the state of Veracruz. Another
said a federal agent had organized a prison break in the state of
Tamaulipas, which borders Texas.
</P>
<P>
   If the hypotheses put forward to explain the crime surge are
tidy, criminality is complex, and what seems to make sense in one
place may not in another.
</P>
<P>
   Homicide, for instance, has jumped dramatically in Tijuana and
Ciudad Juarez, cities that are the main border drug corridors;
organized crime is clearly at work there. Murder is also rampant in
the Mexico City suburbs, where the newly rich are building luxury
residences alongside slums. There, some believe that growing
economic inequality is the cause, since, as the criminologist
Lawrence Sherman of the University of Maryland says, ``Inequality
is a major predictor of homicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Some crimes and the investigations of them become so byzantine
that they support various hypotheses. One such case was the murder
of a senior banking executive, found dead in his car last August.
Because his watch was missing, the authorities said he had been
killed during a robbery; the economic crisis seemed to blame.
</P>
<P>
   But then, as the case dragged on, new factors seemed to be at
play. No arrests were made in this prominent case for 10 months;
this demonstrated anew to millions of Mexicans that crime does
indeed pay and added weight to the theory that lawlessness is
surging because few crimes are punished. Then developments
supported those who put police depradations at center stage.
</P>
<P>
   Early this month, the police charged a 28-year-old laborer,
Sergio Diaz, with the murder. But then chagrined prosecutors
released him, based on his bizarre story. He said the police
officers who arrested him had kidnapped him last year, holding him
until his family paid a $9,000 ransom. But Diaz had dared to file
kidnapping charges, and several officers were eventually arrested,
though quickly released. They set about getting even, and
eventually framed him on the murder charges. Prosecutors concluded
that Diaz had nothing to do with the murder. The police have not
been punished.
</P>
<P>
   Citizen protests over many similar outrages appear to have
gotten the government's attention. On June 12, Interior Minister
Francisco Labastida announced a bigger crime budget.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say anti-crime efforts are still moving slowly. One
example: In the mid-1980s, the government promised to compile a
single, computerized file of information on all Mexican police
officers, thus helping the authorities to avoid hiring criminals.
Three presidencies and nearly 15 years later, the list is still
incomplete; now Zedillo's aides are promising to finish it.
</P>
<P>
   When will the registry be done, an Interior Ministry official
was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want to give a date,'' he said.

   MEXICO CITY _ Not so long ago, Mexico seemed a reasonably safe
place, especially when compared with Latin American societies in
the throes of civil war or paramilitary violence. But that's
changed. Now virtually every day, terrifying new crimes dramatize
the country's public security crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Just in recent weeks, a Vermont artist was knifed to death on a
Pacific Coast beach. A kidnapper called a Mexico City newspaper to
boast about hacking off the ears of his hostages and to jeer at the
authorities' inability to stop him. Military police ordered to
investigate the disappearance of scores of people in a city on the
Texas border were themselves arrested collecting a kidnapping
ransom. The State Department has cautioned visiting Americans about
the rising crime rates.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican criminologists, sociologists and others are debating
what's gone wrong. How did one of the safest countries in the
hemisphere become a place where tourists are panicking and millions
fear criminal attack whenever they leave home?
</P>
<P>
   Some blame the economy, which for 15 years has seen real wages
fall and the breach between rich and poor widen. Some cite
sociology, saying that an entire generation of police officers are
now using their violent skills as participants in organized crime.
Others trace the crisis to the justice system, which is so
discredited that most crimes go unreported, fewer are investigated,
and only a tiny fraction of the perpetrators are ever punished.
</P>
<P>
   Some even blame the growth of democracy, which by stripping
Mexico's ruling party of many of its authoritarian powers has also
diminished its ability to repress crime.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is common to all these explanations. There is a sense
that Mexico's top civilian authorities have lost control of the
country's criminals, who now see lucrative opportunities on all
sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``In practical terms, the Mexican state simply doesn't respond
to most crimes,'' said Ernesto Lopez Portillo, co-author of a 1994
study of public security issues. ``The authorities refuse to
recognize the severity of the public security crisis, partly
because it's so frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   The facts are sobering. Although record-keeping is chaotic, and
fear of police keeps many victims from reporting crimes, government
statistics for Mexico City show that reported murders rose by 50
percent from 1990 to 1995 and that robbery incidents have
multiplied six-fold in 15 years. Experts estimate that kidnappings
in Mexico, once rare, now number at least 1,500 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Ruiz Harrell, a professor who is one of Mexico's most
meticulous crime statisticians, has charted annual figures for all
reported crimes since 1930 and concluded: ``There's a clear
association between economic crisis and crime.''
</P>
<P>
   For 50 years after 1930, Mexican workers enjoyed an almost
uninterrupted rise in their standard of living, and in those years,
he says, crime declined with equal constancy, even though Mexican
wages remained far below the standard in the United States. But
beginning in 1983, the first year after an economic crisis sent
wages into free-fall, crime rates took off, and they have yet to
level out. In 1995, the year following a disastrous peso
devaluation, reported crimes in Mexico surged 35 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never before in our history has crime grown this rapidly,''
Ruiz said. ``The figures speak for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Economic determinism has its critics, however, including
President Ernesto Zedillo. In an appearance in June in New York,
Zedillo said that attributing street crime to economic factors
amounts to blaming the poor. Instead, he said, the problem lies
with the ``inefficiency'' of Mexico's crime-fighting institutions.
</P>
<P>
   How do inefficient police and prosecutors translate into more
crime? ``Potential criminals act rationally and base their decision
to commit a crime on an analysis of costs and benefits,'' said a
recent World Bank study of crime in Latin America. Potential
criminals, it said, estimate the payoff of a crime, the costs
associated with committing it, and the probability of punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Those who apply this calculus in Mexico see that crimes like
kidnapping and drug trafficking have proven extremely lucrative in
recent years, and punishment is rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Mexico as elsewhere, crime is a career option that competes
with others,'' said Lopez. Many Mexicans are turning to crime
because punishment is remote. The criminal justice system is
chaotic; the country has had seven attorney generals in nine years,
and turnover among lower officials is higher. Given the disorder,
Lopez estimated that of each 100 crimes reported to authorities,
only five are investigated.
</P>
<P>
   But Mexico's justice system has never worked efficiently, so why
is crime surging now? Until recently, Lopez said, government
officials from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, known
as the PRI, controlled the criminal class, often favoring one mafia
in exchange for kickbacks while suppressing rival groups and never
allowing crime to surpass certain bounds. But as the PRI has begun
to share power, it has lost control of the criminals, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old rules no longer apply and new ones haven't emerged,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lucio Mendoza, a former analyst at the national security agency
who now runs a research organization, said the authorities have not
only lost control but that members of the police are now the main
organizers of crime.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in the late 1960s, he said, successive presidents gave
the police, especially members of an elite corps known as the
Federal Security Directorate, license to eliminate accused
subversives by whatever means they felt necessary. By the early
1980s guerrillas had been suppressed, and the police turned their
extralegal skills to organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a cancer that expanded,'' Mendoza said. ``They
went into drugs, car theft, kidnaps, piracy, truck hijackings. This
is the cause of the crime rates we see today.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a recent newsletter, Mendoza cited 39 articles published in
major Mexican newspapers between May 22 and June 9, each detailing
spectacular police criminality.
</P>
<P>
   One said Mexico City police officers, using a government
computer, were identifying and then threatening citizens who report
crime. Another reported the arrest of 11 police officers who were
trafficking in migrant workers in the state of Veracruz. Another
said a federal agent had organized a prison break in the state of
Tamaulipas, which borders Texas.
</P>
<P>
   If the hypotheses put forward to explain the crime surge are
tidy, criminality is complex, and what seems to make sense in one
place may not in another.
</P>
<P>
   Homicide, for instance, has jumped dramatically in Tijuana and
Ciudad Juarez, cities that are the main border drug corridors;
organized crime is clearly at work there. Murder is also rampant in
the Mexico City suburbs, where the newly rich are building luxury
residences alongside slums. There, some believe that growing
economic inequality is the cause, since, as the criminologist
Lawrence Sherman of the University of Maryland says, ``Inequality
is a major predictor of homicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Some crimes and the investigations of them become so byzantine
that they support various hypotheses. One such case was the murder
of a senior banking executive, found dead in his car last August.
Because his watch was missing, the authorities said he had been
killed during a robbery; the economic crisis seemed to blame.
</P>
<P>
   But then, as the case dragged on, new factors seemed to be at
play. No arrests were made in this prominent case for 10 months;
this demonstrated anew to millions of Mexicans that crime does
indeed pay and added weight to the theory that lawlessness is
surging because few crimes are punished. Then developments
supported those who put police depradations at center stage.
</P>
<P>
   Early this month, the police charged a 28-year-old laborer,
Sergio Diaz, with the murder. But then chagrined prosecutors
released him, based on his bizarre story. He said the police
officers who arrested him had kidnapped him last year, holding him
until his family paid a $9,000 ransom. But Diaz had dared to file
kidnapping charges, and several officers were eventually arrested,
though quickly released. They set about getting even, and
eventually framed him on the murder charges. Prosecutors concluded
that Diaz had nothing to do with the murder. The police have not
been punished.
</P>
<P>
   Citizen protests over many similar outrages appear to have
gotten the government's attention. On June 12, Interior Minister
Francisco Labastida announced a bigger crime budget.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say anti-crime efforts are still moving slowly. One
example: In the mid-1980s, the government promised to compile a
single, computerized file of information on all Mexican police
officers, thus helping the authorities to avoid hiring criminals.
Three presidencies and nearly 15 years later, the list is still
incomplete; now Zedillo's aides are promising to finish it.
</P>
<P>
   When will the registry be done, an Interior Ministry official
was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want to give a date,'' he said.

INTERNET IS NEW PET ISSUE IN CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Ariz., Ind., Alaska, Mo., Vt., Calif., Ore., Wash.)  (lb) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Internet, with its influence on everything from
commerce and national security to privacy and crime, has become an
issue as politically alluring to many lawmakers as cutting taxes,
educating children and locking up criminals.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that not a week goes by on Capitol Hill without a
hearing, a meeting or a gathering about one of a bevy of
Internet-related issues confronting Congress.
</P>
<P>
   When revenue-hungry governors threatened to tax the Internet,
Congress got busy drafting legislation to keep levies at bay, a
bill that passed the House last week. When parents expressed fears
about pedophiles stalking their children on the Internet, the House
passed legislation to help prosecutors chase them down. And when
Hollywood voiced deep concern about copyright piracy in cyberspace,
House members began studying the question of how to protect
software and movies.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers have also grown fond of making speeches about the
subject. Just listen to Rep. Thomas Bliley Jr., R-Va., chairman of
the Commerce Committee, who recently delivered remarks to the
Computer and Communications Industry Association trade group,
praising its members' ingenuity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The digital and information revolution in which many people in
this room are front-line soldiers is truly liberating,'' Bliley
said. ``You should be proud of your contributions. So much has been
done in a few short years. Congress can be proud as well, of some
of the work it is doing. And since there is an election coming up,
I will claim credit for most it.''
</P>
<P>
   Just two years ago, the term ``chat room'' conveyed nothing but
a cozy hideaway office in the Capitol to most Senators and House
members. And only 14 of them boasted Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   So what changed?
</P>
<P>
   Millions of voters have discovered the Internet. An estimated 23
million people in the United States now log on to the Internet, a
figure that grows tremendously every day, and profits continue to
skyrocket, including sales figures for goods that are bought and
sold on line.
</P>
<P>
   This growth dovetailed with another crucial change in the
high-technology industry. Once loath to lobby Congress, executives
of the industry have discovered Washington's relevance the hard way
_ watching Microsoft take a pounding, for example _ and have
started paying regular visits to influential members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, huddled with
lawmakers and Justice Department officials to discuss the
encryption of data on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For politicians, a breed perpetually in search of fresh battles
and causes, the Internet offers a freshly minted take on old but
sprightly issues. It gives lawmakers a new theme on which to stump,
one that remains virtually wide open and unmarked.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., has taken his opposition to gambling in
the real world to the next level, gambling online. His legislation
would ban it.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Republicans and Democrats joined forces in
combating pedophiles who stalk children online. And Sen. Dan Coats,
R-Ind., is working to try to stamp out online pornography. Congress
tried to do that in 1996 in its first real effort to deal with the
Internet, but that law was struck down by the Supreme Court last
year.
</P>
<P>
   There are new issues as well. The scourge of junk e-mail, or
spam, was the topic of a recent Senate subcommittee hearing at
which Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, one of the senior members of
the Senate, could not help but reminisce about the old days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you recall the first time I ran into Spam,''
he told the assembled senators and witnesses, with a chuckle. ``I
do. It was as a youngster during World War II. It was rationed. A
can of Spam and a cigarette.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed a plan to combat junk e-mail earlier this
year. The House has not taken up the issue.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming months the Senate is expected to consider the tax
moratorium, children's protection and copyright privacy on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Vice President Al Gore and his Democratic allies in
Congress had a near lock on the subject of cyberspace, at least in
the view of most Americans. The Republicans had Speaker Newt
Gingrich, who was equally smitten with high technology.
</P>
<P>
   But now other Republicans have started to make inroads on the
information highway, framing themselves as natural allies of the
libertarian-minded high-technology community industry, with which
they share a fondness for laissez-faire governance.
</P>
<P>
   Several prominent senators, including John McCain, R-Ariz., have
taken to speaking often, and with intelligence, on the Internet's
impact on society and the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers sense what pollsters know. Many of the legions of
Internet devotees hopscotch just as easily from one party to
another. ``The real group up for grabs in the future are the
libertarians,'' said Kellyanne Fitzpatrick, a Republican pollster
who has queried lawmakers and the public about the Internet and has
found a substantial rise in interest. ``Some call themselves
liberals and some call themselves conservatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, with both sides engaged, these cyber issues are beginning
to acquire the traditional partisan gloss of election-year
politics. Most recently, Republicans lashed out at the Clinton
administration when they discovered that an effort to hook up every
classroom in the United States to the Internet, something Congress
endorsed in 1996, is resulting in heftier telephone bills for some
taxpayers. They have dubbed it the ``Gore tax.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And it seems that not a day drifts by without someone somewhere
on Capitol Hill admonishing Gore about the dreaded year 2000
problem, which is shorthand for the devastating consequences that
could be suffered if computers are not reprogrammed to recognize 00
as 2000 instead of 1900.
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, however, these cyber issues, which are
mostly nonpartisan in nature, tend to draw together hostile forces.
Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., one of the most conservative members of
Congress, has teamed up with Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., a longtime
liberal, over the issue of data encryption. The same sort of bond
was cemented between Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., and Sen. Ron
Wyden, D-Ore., for the moratorium on Internet taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is relatively new, and the technology has changed
so rapidly that it's not in a well-worn partisan rut,'' said Cox,
who added that he works routinely with Ira Magaziner, the
administration's Internet guru. ``There isn't a partisan lock on
this.`
</P>
<P>
   These members have forged these alliances around a common
interest: staving off regulation, a position wholeheartedly
supported by the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rick White, a Republican who is from Microsoft territory in
Washington, describes the mission of Congress as establishing
``rules of the road,'' a basic framework.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy and the others fear that the Internet is becoming too
popular a topic too quickly in Congress, and leading too often to
``bumper-sticker politics,'' especially when it comes to privacy.
``Those that want short-term political gains are closing out the
possibility of real long-term benefits,'' Leahy said.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus today, White said, is ``we better not move too
fast.'' But, he added, ``the pressure is continuing to build.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensing that pressure, the industry is also beginning to act. At
the behest of lawmakers and the administration, two industry
organizations submitted plans this week to address the outcry over
the violations of consumers' privacy on the Internet. Many people
fear giving out their Social Security numbers on the Internet,
feeling that that is like Big Brother.
</P>
<P>
   But some lawmakers maintain that legislation is needed to
safeguard the privacy of people who conduct business on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, members have tried to educate themselves and
each other about the Internet. For example, Rep. W.J. ``Billy''
Tauzin, R-La., the chairman of a subcommittee, held a series of
what he called ``tutorials'' on the impact of electronic commerce.
He said that lawmakers were beginning to realize that the old
legislative framework did not necessarily apply to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference today is that if you are not prepared to deal
with a new paradigm of virtual stores and boundaryless commerce,
where brick and mortar is not relevant, then you will be a
dinosaur,'' Tauzin said. ``We are just beginning to be prepared.''

NEW BOOK TELLS OF FRENZY AT DIANA CRASH SITE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ French investigators looking into the crash that killed
Princess Diana and her companion have gathered little evidence to
bolster initial police theories that photographers chasing the car
caused the driver to lose control, according to a new book that
quotes extensively from police reports.
</P>
<P>
   The chauffeur, who was killed instantly, was far over the legal
driving limit for alcohol, French authorities said a day after the
accident. That fact remains the biggest probable cause of the
tragedy, and witnesses quoted in the book say Diana's Mercedes was
some distance ahead of pursuing photographers when it skidded and
struck a tunnel support pillar at high speed.
</P>
<P>
   But testimony quoted in the new account nevertheless paints a
devastating picture of the behavior of some of the photographers
who had been chasing Diana and her escort, Emad Mohamed al-Fayed,
nicknamed Dodi, for 12 hours before the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of the 10 photographic agency employees who were among
the first to arrive at the scene tried to call an ambulance,
according to reports of their testimony to police.
</P>
<P>
   Two others spent the first minutes after the crash snapping
pictures of the wreck with Fayed, son of the owner of the Ritz
Hotel, and the driver, Henri Paul, the hotel's acting security
director, lying dead and the princess and a bodyguard gravely
injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true, we didn't help the injured,'' one of the two,
Christian Martinez, testified, according to the book. ``I was
paralyzed by the connection between me and the people in the car.''
</P>
<P>
   The other, Romuald Rat, reportedly told police that he opened
the door and tried to take Diana's pulse as she lay moaning in the
wreckage. He also reportedly tried to comfort the bodyguard, the
sole survivor of the crash, but film in Rat's camera later showed
that he had also taken photographs before rescuers arrived.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first policemen on the scene, Sebastien Dorzee,
testified, according to the book: ``I was trying to push back the
photographers, who were virulent. In the heat of the action, I was
knocked around several times. At no time did a photographer come to
give me a hand. They kept taking pictures the whole time.''
</P>
<P>
   The princess, Dorzee said, had her eyes open and spoke words he
could not understand. ``I think she said `My God,' seeing her
friend was dead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Martinez, the police, nor the investigating judges who
are expected to bring charges in the case by autumn commented on
the extensive excerpts from testimony in the book, ``Investigation
on the Death of Diana,'' published by Editions Stock and written by
Jean-Marie Pontaut and Jerome Dupuis, two investigative reporters
for the weekly newsmagazine L'Express.
</P>
<P>
   The investigating judges could charge some or all of the nine
photographers under investigation in the chase with manslaughter or
failure to come to the aid of the victims in the accident, both
crimes punishable by five years in prison and an $83,000 fine. A
tenth man who is under investigation, a motorcycle driver for Rat,
told police that he was disgusted by the photographers' behavior at
the crash scene.
</P>
<P>
   The judges could also theoretically charge the Ritz Hotel
management with criminal negligence for allowing Paul to take the
wheel drunk and without the chauffeur's license required by French
law.
</P>
<P>
   Police reports quoted in the book contradict assurances by the
Ritz management and by the Fayed family that nobody in the hotel
knew Paul could have been drunk when Fayed asked him to drive as
the couple left the hotel soon after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   According to the book, two bartenders at the hotel, Sebastien
Trote and Philippe Doucin, testified that Paul drank two shots of
Ricard, a licorice-flavored alcoholic drink, diluted with water,
after being summoned back to work unexpectedly at 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   But it adds that Paul, who had gone to a doctor friend to obtain
drugs to treat a problem with alcoholism, had consumed many more
drinks, probably at home, after being told earlier that he could
have the night off.
</P>
<P>
   After his death, police found a blood alcohol level of between
0.173 and 0.187 percent in his body, more than three times the
legal limit in France. The book says that an even higher level,
0.218 percent, was found in his urine.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the reported testimony confirms accounts of the long
investigation that have been slowly leaking out since the accident.
The French police found nothing, officials say, that would confirm
conspiracy theories voiced by Dodi's father, Mohamed al-Fayed.
</P>
<P>
   He is a London-based Egyptian businessman who has fought
unsuccessfully for British citizenship and has encouraged
speculation that the British Secret Service assassinated the couple
to prevent the embarrassment that would have been caused to the
royal family if they had decided to marry.
</P>
<P>
   But the authorities did find incontrovertible physical evidence,
the book reports, that the Mercedes sideswiped a smaller white Fiat
Uno while passing it just before heading, at over 80 mph, into the
tunnel under Place de l'Alma.
</P>
<P>
   A report by a police crime laboratory quoted in the book matched
Fiat taillight fragments found near the tunnel entrance with a long
white paint scrape and other marks on the right side of the
Mercedes and concluded that the larger car had brushed a Fiat built
between 1983 and 1987 just before the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses also told police that they saw a dazed man driving a
battered light-colored Fiat Uno weaving slowly out of the tunnel
just after the accident. Police tracked down tens of thousands of
cars matching the description but have not yet found the vehicle or
the driver present that night. &QL;

WHITE HOUSE AND RENO AT ODDS ON PRIVILEGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Changes ``next week'' to ``this week'' in 1st graf. No other
changes.)  (lb) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a striking disagreement over the Lewinsky
matter, the White House and the Justice Department have taken
significantly different legal positions in a federal appeals case
that will be argued this week over whether President Clinton can
invoke the attorney-client privilege to sharply limit the
questioning of one of his closest aides.
</P>
<P>
   Legal briefs unsealed by the appeals court late on Friday
disclosed an unusual rift between Clinton's White House lawyers and
Attorney General Janet Reno over the testimony of one of the
president's closest aides, Bruce Lindsey, the deputy White House
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The briefs disclose that the positions staked out for oral
arguments on Monday present the appeals court with a highly unusual
situation. Three entities _ the office of the president, the
Department of Justice and the independent counsel _ each of which
purport to be the voice of the executive branch in the case, have
put forward three competing views on the law on attorney-client
privilege for all federal agencies and officials.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are seeking to question Lindsey about his
conversations with the president and other witnesses as part of the
five-month inquiry into whether anyone committed perjury or
obstruction of justice concerning Clinton's relationship with
Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, argues that government
lawyers cannot invoke the privilege in criminal inquiries,
particularly because federal employees have an obligation under the
law to report evidence of crimes to the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   The president maintains that he enjoys an absolute privilege
that protects all of his conversations with government lawyers from
being disclosed to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   A brief signed by Reno for the Justice Department takes a middle
ground. It contends that in criminal inquiries, the president's
attorney-client privilege is a qualified one that can be pierced by
a federal judge who finds that the evidence being sought is
essential to the inquiry and is not available elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The distinction between the two positions articulated by the
Clinton administration, although subtle, is critical for both the
White House and the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers assert that the president, not the courts,
should be the final arbiter of whether Clinton can keep
conversations he has had with government lawyers confidential.
White House lawyers maintain that a qualified privilege is no real
privilege at all because Clinton would never be certain whether his
consultations with his lawyers would be kept confidential.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very essence of the protection afforded by an absolute
privilege is its predictability _ a quality that is of peculiar
importance in the case now before the court,'' the White House
contended in its brief.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Clinton faced the possibility of an impeachment
proceeding as a result of the Lewinsky inquiry, it added: ``The
president, in his official capacity, must be entitled to consult
with his official counsel on matters bearing on his official
responsibilities _ and on the defense of his constitutional status
as head of the executive branch. If he cannot do so with the
assurance that his conversations will be protected, he will be
disabled from securing the candid, frank legal advice to which he
is entitled _ disabled at the very moment that, under our
constitutional scheme, the president is in the greatest need of
such advice.''
</P>
<P>
   But Reno has replied that the courts alone are in the neutral
position to adequately weigh the needs of an investigation and
justice against the president's interest in candid and confidential
advice.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In most disputes between two federal agencies about the use of
the attorney-client privilege, the attorney general intervenes and
decides whether the privilege should be invoked or waived.
Typically, the privilege is waived in such situations.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department normally represents the interests of the
president in legal proceedings that involve issues like
attorney-client privilege or executive privilege. But early in the
Lewinsky inquiry, Reno decided to remove the department from
representing the president in those matters, suggesting that it
would be a conflict of interest because she had recommended
referring the Lewinsky matter to Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Justice Department ultimately decided to
intervene in the case and file a friend of the court brief because
of the institutional interests it has in the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's experience indicates that it would be
rare for the attorney general to strike the balance against
obtaining evidence, ``given the compelling federal interest in the
investigation of criminal inquiry,'' the department's brief said.
</P>
<P>
   But it added that, in inquiries involving independent counsels,
the attorney general and the president were in no position to weigh
the merits of such claims of privilege and that the independent
counsel was in no position to consider the institutional concerns
of the office of the president in keeping certain matters
confidential.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal involves a decision last month by Judge Norma
Holloway Johnson of U.S. District Court that Clinton enjoys only a
qualified privilege that is outweighed by the needs of
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department brief generally supported that ruling,
although it said that Judge Johnson should have applied a
``heightened standard'' before she ultimately ruled against
Clinton. The standard proposed by the Justice Department is that
the material being sought should be found to be ``essential to the
justice of the case'' or ``demonstrably critical'' to the grand
jury's inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The brief filed by Starr has not been unsealed, but the Justice
Department and White House criticize each other's position in their
court papers.
</P>
<P>
   The White House brief, written by Neil Eggleston, a former White
House lawyer now in private practice, said that the Justice
Department ``confuses two analytically distinct questions, and
arrives at an incorrect result.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The department's proposed approach reaches a result
inconsistent with the unbroken common-law authorities holding the
privilege, once asserted, is absolute and not subject to
balancing,'' the White House brief said.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ In supercomputing, the time separating the
world's fastest computer from the scrap-metal heap is appallingly
short.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to supercomputers, to become obsolescent isn't
necessarily to become useless. While many of these machines are
mothballed in dank basements, a few are proudly displayed in
private homes as though they were objets d'art. They can also make
dandy space heaters.
</P>
<P>
   The obsolescence of a supercomputer is predictable. The reason,
of course, is Moore's Law. Three decades ago, the co-founder of
Intel Corp., Gordon Moore, observed that every 18 months it is
possible to place about twice the number of transistors on the same
piece of silicon. So now personal computers are nearly as fast as
yesterday's supercomputer _ which cost many thousands of dollars
more.
</P>
<P>
   The life span of a supercomputer, which may cost upwards of $30
million, is typically five years, and sometimes far less. Jack
Dongarra, a computer scientist at the University of Tennessee who
maintains an annual list of the world's 500 fastest computers,
finds that about 250 machines fall off his list yearly.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no pasture to go out to when a supercomputer is
retired. No one reharnesses it to do the billing statements for the
local waterworks. The life of a machine is nasty, brutish and
short.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the connoisseurs.
</P>
<P>
   In a warehouse in suburban Seattle, Nathan Myhrvold, Microsoft's
chief scientist, keeps a growing collection now numbering six
supercomputers _ three early Crays and three Connection Machines
made by Thinking Machines Corp. The Cray 1, designed in 1976 by the
legendary inventor Seymour Cray, was notable in part because it was
a round refrigerator-shaped cabinet encircled by a padded bench,
which was just the thing for technicians who needed to work on the
machine's innards.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the original Crays have less processing power than some
$1,000 personal computers, but as fashion statements, their time
may be here again.
</P>
<P>
   Myhrvold is now planning a new home that will rival that of his
boss, Bill Gates. It will have a living room big enough for a
supercomputer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key aesthetic is that it is the most expensive sofa in the
world,'' said Myhrvold, who bought his machines for their salvage
costs or for a few thousand dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Myhrvold is not the only computer designer who finds the
furniture concept attractive. Not long ago Brewster Kahle, one of
the founders of Thinking Machines Corp., learned that one of the
company's Connection Machines was sitting unplugged in the basement
of the Yale University computer science department.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that old supercomputers are remarkably expensive to
run. Electricity for a Cray 1 would cost $30,000 a month with an
additional $30,000 in electricity costs for the refrigeration
system, according to Dag Spicer, manager of historical collection
at the Computer Museum History Center in Mountain View, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The operating cost didn't bother Kahle, however; he paid Yale
$500 for the Connection Machine and then spent $1,000 for shipping.
It now sits in storage under a staircase in San Francisco, near his
office.
</P>
<P>
   Kahle has big plans for his Connection Machine, which has
thousands of flashing lights and would look right at home on the
flight deck of the starship Enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awfully big,'' said Kahle. ``I think I'm going to need a
conference room to display it in, or maybe my next living room.''
</P>
<P>
   A small living room didn't constrain Dan Lynch, an Internet
pioneer who was one of the founders of Cybercash. Lynch, a wine
aficionado, says he has a Cray 1 as an objet d'art in his vineyard
in the Napa Valley along with ``a bunch of tired old '47 Chevys.''
</P>
<P>
   While at Convex, a Texas-based supercomputer company, Steven
Wallach, a computer designer, once used an Alliant supercomputer in
his office as a conversation piece and as partial support for his
desk.
</P>
<P>
   But even Wallach, who was one of the designers featured in Tracy
Kidder's book, ``Soul of a New Machine'' (Atlantic/Little, Brown,
1982), said he was surprised to learn that another Convex employee
had bought a Convex C-1 for its scrap price and was using the
computer to heat his garage.

   BOGOTA, Colombia _ A clamor is rising on all sides for an end to
decades of political violence here, so a weekly news magazine,
Cambio 16, had the novel idea of asking each of the parties to
state its goals for waging war.
</P>
<P>
   In their separate wish lists, all of the players _ the assorted
leftist groupings, the right-wing paramilitaries, the government _
spoke of land reform, of opening the political landscape for new
movements, of investing more in education and health, and of
Colombians gaining greater benefits from the country's natural
resources. Even the right-wing paramilitaries questioned the value
of an unfettered free market.
</P>
<P>
   So striking were the similarities that the magazine's cover that
week featured head shots of the main actors. ``So Then, Why Are
They Fighting?'' it asked.
</P>
<P>
   That question has become more pressing with the election last
Sunday of Andres Pastrana as the next president of Colombia, on a
platform in which the top priority was negotiating an end to the
political violence that has claimed more than 31,000 lives so far.
</P>
<P>
   It has also become more relevant in Washington, where the
administration is growing more involved in Colombia in activities
that could intensify war and in measures that could bring peace.
</P>
<P>
   Quietly, the Pentagon has been aiding the Colombian military in
the name of fighting drug trafficking, though it acknowledges that
the training and equipment may be used to fight insurgents
unconnected to the drug trade. At the same time, the State
Department has been sponsoring informal seminars that bring the
parties to the Colombian conflict into contact with veterans of
peace negotiations in Guatemala and El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
   Over nearly four decades, the conflict in Colombia has come to
resemble nothing so much as the old commercials for Timex watches
that, strapped to a horse's hoof or the wheel of a car, just kept
on ticking. In the rest of Latin America, rebels have laid down
their weapons, as in Guatemala; tried their hand at government, as
in Nicaragua, or been crushed by government forces, as in Peru. But
in Colombia, the gruesome conflict keeps on plumbing new depths of
horror.
</P>
<P>
   Eerily, Colombia still betrays the language, suspicions and
reflexes of the Cold War. Senior military officers contend the
rebels are out to take power and establish a narco-communist state,
and they brand human rights workers as guerrillas. The rebels seem
unconvinced by communism's defeat in Europe, insisting there must
be something better _ a post neo-liberal, post-Cuban model for
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious and frequent reason experts cite for the
continued fighting here is drug trafficking, which bankrolls both
the rebels and the most important paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence analysts estimate that the rebels collect some $100
million a year in commissions for protecting landing strips, crops
and labs in zones they control, while two major paramilitary
leaders in Colombia have become drug dealers ``involved in all
aspects of the drug trade,'' according to one U.S. intelligence
analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has ever portrayed the insurgents as enjoying an easy
life thanks to drug funds. Their fighting forces live in the
mountains, rise by dawn and change camps every few days to elude
detection, said Daniel Garcia Pena, who heads the Colombian
government's peace commission. The funds have, though, provided all
sides with the means to wage a war that has become a way of life,
ideological declarations aside.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the declarations do not tell the whole story. What does
talk about a future, scaled-back role for the military say about
the resentment that seethes and multiplies when whole villages of
peasants are forced from their homes by one side or the other?
</P>
<P>
   One member of the leading guerrilla group, the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia, said he had been active in his church as
a young man but joined the rebels after the military murdered his
wife because of his leftist sympathies.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Castano tells a brutal story of how his brother Fidel
created the right-wing paramilitaries after their father died in
the custody of guerrillas who kidnapped him for ransom nearly 20
years ago. The father was tied to a tree and, perhaps mad with fear
and confinement, he stretched the tether to its limit and ran
headlong into the trunk, crushing his head, said an educator with
close ties to the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   These are intimate hatreds, whose ghosts fly across generations
and borders.
</P>
<P>
   And even within the public lists of their goals, the same words
_ agrarian reform, political reform _ have different meanings on
different lips. In some cases, they have no meaning at all.
</P>
<P>
   For some rebels, land reform is a way of distributing large
estates that are not personally worked by their owners. At the
other end, Castano, the paramilitary leader whose death squads
commit about 70 percent of all the political murders, runs a banana
cooperative in Uraba that, he says, is a model of agrarian reform.
Skeptics say the cooperative is only an effort by the
paramilitaries to establish political credentials, and a way to
repopulate areas they have emptied of other peasants.
</P>
<P>
   Now, people here are wondering whether this grinding conflict
has really reached a turning point, given an emerging public
consensus that government forces have not managed to defeat the
rebels on the battlefield. No cease-fire is required for peace
talks to begin, so analysts here expect conflict and dialogue will
intensify at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia may well move toward peace as it has through war,
bloodily and tangled in contradictions.

<P>
   BEIJING _ About the last thing President Clinton wanted to hear
during the first day of his visit to China was that the authorities
had rounded up several dissidents in Xian, the city where he landed
Thursday evening. Yet keeping naysayers away when any big public
event occurs is pretty much the way things work in China.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's trip was carefully planned to show as much of the
nonpolitical side of China as possible _ villagers, business
executives and teachers are on the itinerary _ and part of the
intention was evidently to keep from being swamped in debates over
human rights. The President could not avoid speaking about human
rights altogether, but he evidently wanted to avoid dwelling on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   But there it was anyway, and it arguably made sense, as Clinton
did, to speak about his country's own beliefs rather than to
lecture his hosts about their own shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights is one of those issues, like self-determination for
Taiwan, that so fundamentally divide the United States and China
that no amount of summitry can bridge the difference. And the U.S.
and Chinese presidents, despite all the reasons they may have to
improve relations and cooperate on security and economic issues,
are almost permanently vulnerable to unexpected and unpredictable
flare-ups over these questions.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicions about schemes by the Chinese military, or campaign
financing scandals, are likely to come and go like other political
fads in Washington. Yet on a deeper level officials and the general
populace in China and the United States still have fundamentally
different ways of looking at the same issue, and that's where the
problem lies. Often the problems can be set off not by some
centrally organized plan, but by some local potentate or
institution taking initiative on its own, in an act that the other
side nevertheless sees as having import far beyond the local scene.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the dissidents in Xian is a telling example of how
the basic points of view can differ. To the American news media,
any story about a harassed dissident is newsworthy on the day the
president arrives, because human rights in China is a live
political issue in Washington. More important, any whiff of human
rights violations speaks directly to American convictions about
political freedom, so this kind of report can often have a deep
resonance in an American audience.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Chinese response to the story, as relayed to U.S.
officials, was honest: The officials did not want the dissidents to
disrupt the proceedings of the president's arrival. And that kind
of thinking is not limited to Chinese leaders; it also reflects
what ordinary Chinese people say. Whatever these people may think
about the broader value of free expression, Clinton's arrival is so
important an event, in the Chinese view, that anything that
interferes with it even in a peripheral way is best discouraged .
</P>
<P>
   A more serious incident occurred when Harry Wu, the Chinese-born
human rights advocate, was apprehended trying to enter China in
1995 to try to document abuses in China's prison system.
</P>
<P>
   To the vast majority of Americans, China's two-month detention
of Wu was reprehensible and violated any humane standard of
decency. To the vast majority of Chinese, who typically care little
for the rights of prisoners, Wu was a self-serving hype artist who
was only poking about to draw attention to his cause. There was
precious little overlap in the two views.
</P>
<P>
   In one day, Wu's arrest came out of nowhere to cause a serious
rift in U.S.-Chinese relations. Each government was limited by
strong domestic pressures, and it took two months to reach an
acceptable diplomatic solution _ China sentenced Wu to 15 years in
prison for spying, but then released him _ because the views of the
two governments were so far apart.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan, a similarly intractable thorn between Washington and
Beijing, is also prone to producing unexpected problems in
U.S.-Chinese relations.
</P>

<P>
   Contrary to Lincoln Center's expectation, it finally had to

   BEIJING _ About the last thing President Clinton wanted to hear
during the first day of his visit to China was that the authorities
had rounded up several dissidents in Xian, the city where he landed
Thursday evening. Yet keeping naysayers away when any big public
event occurs is pretty much the way things work in China.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's trip was carefully planned to show as much of the
nonpolitical side of China as possible _ villagers, business
executives and teachers are on the itinerary _ and part of the
intention was evidently to keep from being swamped in debates over
human rights. The President could not avoid speaking about human
rights altogether, but he evidently wanted to avoid dwelling on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   But there it was anyway, and it arguably made sense, as Clinton
did, to speak about his country's own beliefs rather than to
lecture his hosts about their own shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights is one of those issues, like self-determination for
Taiwan, that so fundamentally divide the United States and China
that no amount of summitry can bridge the difference. And the U.S.
and Chinese presidents, despite all the reasons they may have to
improve relations and cooperate on security and economic issues,
are almost permanently vulnerable to unexpected and unpredictable
flare-ups over these questions.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicions about schemes by the Chinese military, or campaign
financing scandals, are likely to come and go like other political
fads in Washington. Yet on a deeper level officials and the general
populace in China and the United States still have fundamentally
different ways of looking at the same issue, and that's where the
problem lies. Often the problems can be set off not by some
centrally organized plan, but by some local potentate or
institution taking initiative on its own, in an act that the other
side nevertheless sees as having import far beyond the local scene.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the dissidents in Xian is a telling example of how
the basic points of view can differ. To the American news media,
any story about a harassed dissident is newsworthy on the day the
president arrives, because human rights in China is a live
political issue in Washington. More important, any whiff of human
rights violations speaks directly to American convictions about
political freedom, so this kind of report can often have a deep
resonance in an American audience.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Chinese response to the story, as relayed to U.S.
officials, was honest: The officials did not want the dissidents to
disrupt the proceedings of the president's arrival. And that kind
of thinking is not limited to Chinese leaders; it also reflects
what ordinary Chinese people say. Whatever these people may think
about the broader value of free expression, Clinton's arrival is so
important an event, in the Chinese view, that anything that
interferes with it even in a peripheral way is best discouraged .
</P>
<P>
   A more serious incident occurred when Harry Wu, the Chinese-born
human rights advocate, was apprehended trying to enter China in
1995 to try to document abuses in China's prison system.
</P>
<P>
   To the vast majority of Americans, China's two-month detention
of Wu was reprehensible and violated any humane standard of
decency. To the vast majority of Chinese, who typically care little
for the rights of prisoners, Wu was a self-serving hype artist who
was only poking about to draw attention to his cause. There was
precious little overlap in the two views.
</P>
<P>
   In one day, Wu's arrest came out of nowhere to cause a serious
rift in U.S.-Chinese relations. Each government was limited by
strong domestic pressures, and it took two months to reach an
acceptable diplomatic solution _ China sentenced Wu to 15 years in
prison for spying, but then released him _ because the views of the
two governments were so far apart.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan, a similarly intractable thorn between Washington and
Beijing, is also prone to producing unexpected problems in
U.S.-Chinese relations.
</P>
<P>
   When Cornell University invited Taiwanese President Lee Tung-hui
to commencement in 1995, so many Americans supported Lee's visit _
which he had skillfully portrayed as a simple request for a U.S.
visa by an alumnus to his alma mater, when it actually meant far
more _ and so many Chinese opposed it, that it set the stage for
what happened in March 1996, when the United States and China came
close to military confrontation.

NEWLY FOUND FUNGUS TIED TO VANISHING FROG SPECIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Maine, Calif.)  (lb) 
 By CAROL KAESUK YOON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A newly discovered fungus appears to be the cause of an epidemic
among amphibians that is killing off frogs and toads of a wide
variety of declining species in rain forests in Australia and
Central America, according to a new report by an international team
of researchers. Scientists say the new study may help solve the
mystery of why amphibians are vanishing around the world, often
from pristine, isolated habitats.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen species of frogs, researchers report, are succumbing to
a newly discovered fungus called a chytrid, a type of fungus known
previously to live only on decaying matter and insects. Researchers
say it remains to be seen how and why the fungus is killing frogs
in such large numbers over such a wide area, as well as whether the
fungus is doing its deadly work in areas other than Central America
and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The research is described in a report to appear in next month's
issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The
mystery of the vanishing amphibians has been plaguing scientists
for a decade, ever since they began noticing that frogs were
disappearing. At various times, researchers have proposed
ultraviolet light, pollution and disease as the villains, but
scientists lacked direct evidence that any of these factors was
causing large, widespread declines.
</P>
<P>
   Searching the tissues of dead frogs, biologists on the new study
say, they found fungi as the clear cause. When researchers scraped
fungi off the skin of the dead frogs and infected the water of
healthy frogs, within a couple of weeks all the exposed frogs were
dead or dying. But while researchers described the new study as
convincing, they noted that skin scrapes were not pure samples of
fungus. To be sure that the fungus alone is killing the frogs,
researchers must await the results of a last crucial test.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joyce Longcore, chytrid fungal specialist at the University
of Maine at Orono, said that she had grown a pure culture of the
fungus and that she and colleagues at the National Zoo were in the
process of doing the experiment to find out whether the pure fungus
can kill frogs.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say the new fungus is unlikely to be related to the
limb deformities in Minnesota frogs.
</P>
<P>
   The report to appear next month provides a long-awaited answer
for scientists, who had been mystified by the increasing reports of
large numbers of dead frogs in rain forests in Central and South
America and Australia. Quickly eaten by scavengers, wild frog
cadavers are a rare sight, with biologists typically seeing no more
than two or three in the wild in a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers were ``just stunning,'' said Dr. David Wake,
amphibian biologist at the University of California at Berkeley.
``When you find carcasses in a rain forest, you know you're only
finding a tiny fragment of the number really there.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Researchers still do not know exactly how the fungus kills so
many frogs, but they say they suspect it is by suffocation. Frogs
breathe not only through their lungs, but also by absorbing oxygen
through their moist skin. As the fungus grows in the skin of frogs,
the skin appears to grow more layers, making it more and more
difficult for the frog to absorb the needed oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   While biologists say they are confident that the newly
discovered fungus is the immediate cause of the death of these
frogs, it is unclear whether the frogs were already weakened by
other factors and so more susceptible.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers agree that other factors are certainly at play in
the amphibian deaths around the globe. For example, Wake said it
was very likely that chemical contamination was involved in
California and that ultraviolet light was a factor in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody thinks there's a single answer to this problem,'' Wake
said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers do not know why the fungal disease is emerging now.
Dr. Earl Green, a veterinary pathologist who worked on the project
at the Maryland Animal Health Laboratory, said the new fungus had
been seen in healthy frogs from Maryland and Illinois, suggesting
that the disease may be from more northern climes and made its way
to the tropics recently, perhaps on the boot of a tourist or the
net of a biologist.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, it might easily attack populations that had never
been exposed to it before. Alternatively, the disease may have been
around for years and is only now able to ravage populations
weakened by other factors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to go and look for frogs and say they're gone,
but what we needed were the bodies to work on,'' said Dr. Peter
Daszak, parasitologist at Kingston University in England and an
author of the report. Now, with a shocking number of carcasses at
their disposal, he said, ``at last we seem to be getting
somewhere.''

<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ A spate of shark attacks, including
one that maimed the national body-boarding champion, has baffled
scientists, temporarily closed some beaches along the South African
coast and scared off some surfers.
</P>
<P>
   The champion, Neal Stephenson, lost his right foot and part of
his left leg in an attack near Plettenberg Bay in mid-May. Since
then there have been seven more attacks, doubling the annual
average of four for the coastline between East London and Saldanha
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday a 20-year-old forestry student became the first
fatality. Mauled by a great white shark on Monday while
body-boarding near Gonubie Point, he died after battling blood loss
and clotting problems. (A body board is smaller than a surfboard.
The rider lies prone on it and uses it to do stunts in the waves.)
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon Dudley, a scientist at the Natal Sharks Board in
Umhlanga Rocks, said he could not explain the rash of attacks.
Shark bites usually peak in the vacation rush to the coast at
Christmas, which is summertime here, and again in the midwinter
sardine runs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the notion of a single man-eater roaming the coast pops
up whenever there are several attacks, he said that was impossible
this time. On May 29, two surfers were attacked within 2 hours at
beaches 30 miles apart, and one was probably bitten by a
ragged-tooth, which swims slowly and rarely attacks people. (It is
a close relative of the American sand tiger shark.)
</P>
<P>
   ``That rules out one shark,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Temporary beach closures have followed the attacks, and people
are on the alert. Half an hour before the fatal attack Monday, the
curator of the East London aquarium telephoned the city's chief
lifeguard to say a spear fisherman had told him of spotting a big
shark in the area Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone has been scared from the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes some of the fun out of it,'' said one surfer
interviewed on radio, who said she was still venturing in when she
didn't see diving seabirds or leaping dolphins _ indicators of a
sardine run, and perhaps sharks. ``You definitely think about it.
But you also think you could get killed in a car smash driving to
the beach. The winter swells are up, and we were starved for waves
all summer.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last three years a new tourist attraction, great white
shark viewing, has been criticized by scientists who say it could
increase attacks. Small boats full of tourists, some of them
dangling underwater in suspended cages, troll through straits where
great whites are known to hunt, while crew members pour blood and
seal fat into the water. But the tours operate from Gans Bay and
Mossel Bay and no attacks have happened near either town.
</P>
<P>
   According to the International Shark Attack File at the
University of Florida, South Africa is usually fourth on the world
list of shark attacks, after the United States, Australia and
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks Board helped develop an effective electric shark
repellent device two years ago, Dudley said, but only a scuba
divers' version is sold. A smaller version, for surfers, has been
stalled for lack of venture capital, he said, as has a plan to
replace the nets protecting whole beaches, like the ones on the
Natal coastline. &QL;

<P>
   A blockbuster of a story launched a highly touted television
program. But its central allegation was largely based on a disputed
interviewing technique involving recovered memories that the
American Psychiatric Association has condemned.
</P>
<P>
   Recovered memories _ suppressed horrors dredged up under therapy
_ drew attention a few years ago when they became the basis of a
spate of charges of incest, satanic-ritual abuse and sexual abuse
at child-care centers. They were discredited when investigators
determined that many of them had been implanted by zealous
therapists determined to find a cause for a patient's emotional
distress.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, experts have discovered that some Vietnam-era
veterans under psychiatric care in Veterans Administration
Hospitals are especially suggestible. Recovered memories have made
a comeback, and veterans, they say, find themselves ``remembering''
events that never happened.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics assert that may be the case in a disputed report
alleging that U.S. soldiers used nerve gas in the Vietnam War.
According to ``Newsstand: CNN &AMP; Time,'' U.S. Special Forces troops
used the gas, sarin, in 1970 while attacking a Laotian village that
was presumed to be harboring U.S. defectors.
</P>
<P>
   By using poison gas in the Vietnam War, U.S. soldiers would have
committed an act regarded internationally as a war crime. And in
covering it up for 28 years, the Pentagon would be seen as damaging
U.S. efforts to expose and eliminate Iraq's suspected caches of
nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
   The report by veteran CNN war correspondent Peter Arnett and
producer April Oliver, who did most of the reporting, was broadcast
June 7 and appeared the next day in Time magazine. As a result of
the report, the Pentagon began an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But the air soon began hissing out of the story. Veterans who
had taken part in the mission, called Operation Tailwind, bombarded
the Internet and news media with furious rebuttals. Yes, they had
used gas, they said _ nonlethal tear gas. CNN's own military
analyst, the retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Perry Smith, resigned in
protest when the network wouldn't retract the report.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Newsweek magazine dropped its own bomb. It
revealed that a former Army lieutenant who had participated in the
mission, Robert Van Buskirk, was the primary source for the
nerve-gas allegation, and that he suddenly recalled the use of
sarin only near the end of a five-hour interview with Ms. Oliver.
</P>
<P>
   But Van Buskirk had failed to mention sarin in ``Tailwind''
(Word Books), his 1983 book about the mission. He said he had
suppressed the memories when he experienced a religious awakening
in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the program nor the article mentioned that the central
accusation was based on recovered memories.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said last week that several other veterans who had been
interviewed for the report told him Ms. Oliver ``planted'' the
notion that sarin had been used in the commando raid. CNN has
denied that.
</P>
<P>
   CNN said Friday that it had hired Floyd Abrams, the noted First
Amendment lawyer, to review its reporting and declined further
comment.
</P>
<P>
   But experts in the field of false memories say it is not
difficult to manipulate a susceptible subject, given the right
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recovering a false memory as a war atrocity is not as unusual
as you might think,'' said Pamela Freyd, the executive director of
the False Memory Syndrome Foundation, a national organization of
doctors and researchers that has worked to identify false memories.
</P>
<P>
   No one denies that sexual abuse or war atrocities occur, said
Dr. Loren Pankrantz, a psychologist in Portland, Ore., who worked
for 25 years at a Veterans Administration hospital that treated
Vietnam veterans complaining of post-traumatic stress disorder. But
he added, ``I would be extremely reluctant to believe somebody who
told me they had recovered a memory that had been repressed from
the Vietnam War.''
</P>
<P>
   Pankrantz, who wrote ``Patients Who Deceive'' (Charles Thomas
Press, 1998), a book on post-traumatic stress disorder, said that a
long, intense interview with a subject who is troubled, easily led
to conclusions or eager for approval was ``exactly the context in
which false memories occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a subject might repeat a false account that has been
mentioned earlier in the interview, suddenly believing it to be a
true personal experience. ``Given sufficient pressure and
confusion,'' Pankrantz said, ``they'll say, `Oh, yeah, maybe that
DID happen. Yeah, I remember something about nerve gas now,' The
trouble is, he doesn't know whether that memory came from a few
hours earlier in the interview, or 35 years earlier in the field.''
</P>
<P>
   In clinical settings, some subjects are emotionally disturbed,
some are seeking more generous disability payments _ and some even
also have a kind of Homeric impulse. ``They're basically great
raconteurs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Friday, Van Buskirk said he was diagnosed with
post-traumatic stress disorder at a VA hospital in 1977 or 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was under treatment for 10 years with lithium and
mind-bending drugs,'' said Van Buskirk. He was classified 60
percent disabled, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Allan Young, an anthropologist at McGill University in
Montreal who wrote ``The Harmony of Illusions: Inventing
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder'' (Princeton University Press, 1996)
said he was ``very, very dubious'' about the claims on the CNN
program. Young spent two years at a VA hospital in the United
States studying Vietnam veterans claiming emotional disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   He has been fascinated by new narratives emerging as Vietnam
fades in memory, he said. While many patients obviously had arduous
combat experiences, a growing number of cases ``involve a veteran
who was not in Vietnam _ or if he was in Vietnam, he was not in
combat,'' he said. In group therapy sessions, these patients
assemble shards of others' claims and even snippets of movies into
fantasies of personal combat experiences, usually of heroic actions
or harrowing peril.
</P>
<P>
   But more intriguing, he said, is a small subdivision of that
group _ men who falsely implicate themselves in atrocities. ``They
make up war crimes for themselves,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Why would anybody do that?
</P>
<P>
   Young said that a motive could involve a quest for sympathy, for
bigger disability payments or something far simpler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guaranteed attention,'' he said.

<P>
   All told, critics believe that human rights infractions and an
trade imbalance make a compelling argument for revoking the trade
relationship China enjoys with the United States _ known as Most
Favored Nation, or MFN, status.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this:
</P>
<P>
   By the end of this year, the cumulative U.S. trade deficit with
China during the Clinton administration will be $238 billion. China
imposes what critics say are prohibitively high tariffs _ 100
percent on some automobiles _ and only 1.9 percent of all U.S.
exports are allowed into China while 34.3 percent of Chinese
exports come into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The government expects the year to close with $60 billion in
Chinese goods imported to the United States and $12 billion in U.S.
goods exported to China.
</P>
<P>
   China's record on human rights is little improved since the 1989
Tiananmen Square massacre, and China helped Pakistan develop and
carry out a nuclear test that fuels an arms race in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Still, against a backdrop of U.S. foreign policy of
``constructive engagement,'' China's enormous market potential
gives renewal of MFN status the certainty of a train that has left
the station. Critics are not pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton administration is either in denial or they are
ill-informed,'' said Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-San Francisco, who may be
Congress' most passionate advocate for severing normal trade with
the repressive government.
</P>
<P>
   This was her message to President Clinton on June 11, after he
had called his opponents isolationists: ``If the president doesn't
face up to the realities of his trip to China, to use his own
words, he will be going on a fool's errand.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi said she supports engagement that is ``honest, that is
effective and sustainable _ these are pillars of our foreign policy
_ but there is certainly no most favored nation status from China
to the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``Every year we hear that the importance of the
Chinese market justifies the current policy, and every year the
current policy fails to remove barriers to access to the Chinese
market. Something is clearly wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton approved the annual renewal of MFN earlier this month _
in fact, he said he wants it made permanent _ giving Congress the
opportunity to pass its judgment.
</P>
<P>
   MFN, which Congress is in the process of renaming ``Normal Trade
Relations,'' covers the standard tariff treatment the United States
accords trading partners. Only six nations do not have MFN status:
Afghanistan, Cuba, Laos, North Korea, Vietnam and the former
Yugoslavia _ Serbia and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Revoking China's status, says the administration, would raise
tariffs on Chinese products from about 6 percent today to a
trade-weighted average of 44 percent. This increase would make
American consumers pay approximately $590 million more each year
for goods such as shoes, clothing and small appliances.
</P>
<P>
   China would likely retaliate against U.S. exports, said Susan
Esserman, general counsel for U.S. trade representative's office,
by increasing tariffs and other measures and endangering the $12
billion in U.S. exports to China as well as the $15 billion in
exports to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would threaten the jobs of manufacturing workers, the
income of farmers, the employment of young workers in retailing,
software engineers and workers in every other walk of life,'' she
said. ``The jobs and the export opportunities of their employers
would go to Japan, Europe and other competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Human rights issues are a separate matter, in the view of
Americans eager to develop more U.S.-China trade.
</P>
<P>
   Said Ann Veneman, director of the California Department of Food
and Agriculture: ``People involved in trade do not want trade
interrupted for human rights or other political agendas because
that really hurts people in both countries in terms of the trading
relationship. It hurts any export-dependent industry like
agriculture. Trade has to be separated.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the administration policy _ that China's evolution is
profoundly important to the American people, and that U.S. interest
is best served by a secure, stable and open China _ has broad
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have done some very stupid things over the years trying to
extend non-economic policies to our trade agreements, and we would
all be better off if we allowed trade to flow freely,'' said Ted
Gibson, chief economist of the state Department of Finance.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Der, a veteran human rights advocate in the San Francisco
Chinese American community and now a deputy superintendent of the
state Department of Education, favors open trade but wants to see
bolder American pressure on China.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear the president has turned deaf ears to those who
have made pleas about human rights,'' said Der. ``How hard will
Clinton hit remains the key issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton visit includes an effort by U.S. Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky to have China reduce tariffs and
open markets to more products, said a spokeswoman, Helaine Klasky.
``That is part of the reason we think we ought to be engaged with
China, so we can better be in a position to negotiate such
things,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi, however, would prefer that Washington use the threat of
revoking MFN status with China as leverage to bring about those
reductions and many other changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the basis of trade alone _ forget the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction, if you can, and forget human rights
issues _ we have such a bad deal from the Chinese,'' she said.

 By RANDY KENNEDY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Henry Cohen is a man possessed: He attaches a tiny,
secret-agent-like video camera outside the window of his rental
apartment on West 71st Street and stares at a television showing
his building's front steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got a motion sensor,'' he says, ``so it just records when
somebody's coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   The people Cohen wants to catch coming into his brownstone are
not thieves or drug dealers. They are tourists, like the Chinese
man who kicked Cohen's door one night last month. Or the Paris film
crew that moved in with all its equipment. Or the dozen Dutch
tourists who galloped like gazelles up and down the stairs the
month before.
</P>
<P>
   In a city with a burnished new image, waves of tourism, and
booked-up hotels with the highest rates in the country, it was
bound to happen: Bed-and-breakfasts are springing up all over
Manhattan, where landlords are forgoing the security of long-term
leases for the chance to make thousands more a year putting up
tourists for the night.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the bed-and-breakfasts _ in truth, they usually just
offer a bed _ are in rent-regulated buildings in upscale
neighborhoods, where frustrated landlords have long complained that
they are entitled to more money. They are now making it.
</P>
<P>
   But like a lot of other convenient, money-making endeavors, this
one is illegal in a number of ways. Most operators of transient
rooms in residential buildings violate not only zoning laws and
building codes that require special fire safety measures, but they
also do not have proper licenses and many do not pay sales or hotel
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   And if the apartments are in rent-regulated buildings, the
owners are further prohibited from charging more than the legal
monthly rent, which they easily do when they rent the apartment for
anywhere from $80 to $150 a night.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're in a residential neighborhood, and they're running
a bed-and-breakfast, they are illegal _ it's that simple,'' said
Ted Birkhahn, a spokesman for the Department of Buildings, which
has no estimate of the number of such operations.
</P>
<P>
   But that does not seem to worry Richard Caine, who will talk
passionately and at length about how he uses two apartments in a
rent-stabilized building he owns on West 70th Street as transient
rooms, for which he sometimes charges $125 a night. ``With the rent
laws,'' he explains simply, ``once you give a lease to a person,
you can never get him out.''
</P>
<P>
   So Caine, a part-time actor who has appeared on ``Murphy Brown''
and ``General Hospital,'' has made a thriving business out of
renting his apartments and helping other landlords and cooperative
owners rent theirs to guests, many of them actors and theatrical
directors in town for short visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of any law I'm breaking,'' said Caine,
emphasizing that he is only using his two apartments as short-term
rentals while he prepares to combine them into one apartment to be
used by relatives. He added that because he does not provide meals
or maid service, his building cannot be considered a hotel and
should not be bound by hotel regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a sheet-changer or a floor-cleaner,'' he said. ``What
I'm doing is filling a niche, somewhere between the YMCA and a
hotel, and it's to the advantage of the city. I don't see how
anyone can complain.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the city has shown little interest in exercising its
enforcement power, which mainly consists of shutting the businesses
down, or even in regulating them, perhaps because they provide a
way for many thousands more tourists a year to afford to visit New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Officials could cite only two recent cases of shutting down such
operations after complaints. State and city tax officials also seem
to have turned a blind eye.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the lease-holding tenants in buildings like Caine's have
begun to complain, loudly and with lawyers, describing how their
once-homey apartment buildings have been turned into something like
the jammed stateroom scene from the Marx brothers' ``A Night at the
Opera.''
</P>
<P>
   Llewelyn Barton, who has lived in Caine's building for more than
20 years and now shares a floor with one of the transient rooms,
keeps a log of the traffic she spies through her peephole.
``Appeared to be a group of young guys _ couldn't tell how many,''
reads her March 18 entry. ``They were a little noisy. Saw them
several days in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, after dozens more guests came and went, the
diary picks up testily: ``Couple _ 30-something. Chubby woman with
dark curly hair having an argument and slamming the door. He was
complaining to her that she was never satisfied by anything he
did.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It started several years ago,'' said Ms. Barton, a former
backup singer who runs the computer-help desk at a large
entertainment company, ``but in the last few months, it's gotten
pretty heavy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Levine, a struggling playwright who lives downstairs, said
he was recently followed home at night by two men who suddenly
turned into his doorway and stood behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got really scared,'' he said. ``I thought they were going to
rob me. And then they said, `Richard Caine bed and breakfast?
Richard Caine bed and breakfast?'''
</P>
<P>
   Such operations have been around for years in various guises.
During the recession in the early 1990s, many cooperative owners
stuck with overpriced apartments they could not sell but no longer
lived in began to advertise their places for overnight stays.
</P>
<P>
   Tenants in rental apartments have also earned extra income
illegally while on vacation by letting agencies put up tourists in
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   While such accommodations were long publicized mostly by word of
mouth, the Internet is now full of advertisements for nightly or
weekly apartment rentals and for bed-and-breakfast agencies that
offer enticing descriptions of New York. (One describes the East
Village as ``the land of punk and funk,'' adding ``Madonna lived
here before she became a star.'')
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, who has lived in his sunny rent-controlled apartment for
more than 30 years, said he watched with growing anxiety as his
landlord, Veronica Muth, who bought the building and another one
down the street in 1996, began to convert apartments in both places
into hotel-like rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nine apartments in his building, Cohen believes five are
being used for tourists and short-term corporate tenants, who are
usually charged about $100 a night, depending on the length of stay
and size of the apartment. (That would mean a monthly income per
apartment of about $3,000 _ much more than the regulated rent _ if
the apartment was booked every night.)
</P>
<P>
   So Cohen has transformed himself into a kind of detective,
keeping not only a video record of tourists coming and going, but
still photos of apartments being renovated and audiotapes of
tourists talking about their accommodations. He wants these records
in case he ever has to show in court how his building is being
used.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Muth did not return telephone messages seeking comment about
the buildings, nor did Alan Kucker, a lawyer who has represented
her.
</P>
<P>
   Like other long-term tenants in the same situation, Cohen says
that while he is bothered by noise and tourists mistaking him for a
concierge, his main concern is safety.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled being startled when a confused tourist from China,
thinking that Cohen's locked apartment was his own, kicked the door
in the middle of night.
</P>
<P>
   When new guests arrive late at night, they pick up keys to
Cohen's building at a restaurant, Pizza Joint Too, down the block.
(A reporter who visited the pizza place last week was shown keys to
the front door and apartment No. 4F on a labeled key chain by a
cashier, who said, shrugging, ``Sometimes the owner comes;
sometimes somebody else comes. We just hold the keys.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``There could be keys to this building floating all over this
city, all over the world for that matter,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Leo MacDougall, an American who now lives in Paris and who came
to New York in May with two other Parisians to make a documentary
for French television, said that as soon as the group paid in cash
for their nine-day stay in Cohen's building, they immediately made
copies of the single set of keys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were careful with them, but I can see what he's talking
about,'' MacDougall said, referring to Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   Agencies that help tourists find apartments contend that such
safety concerns are unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   Mary McAulay, who runs Urban Ventures, perhaps the city's
best-known agency, said that in almost 20 years in business, she
has never had a report of a tenant being robbed or assaulted by a
tourist or someone who got hold of a key.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't get perps,'' said Ms. McAulay, who represents about
400 bed-and-breakfasts and so-called unhosted apartments, a number
that fluctuates greatly and always shoots up in the summer. ``These
are people who are as concerned about their own security as the
other tenants.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen is not convinced. He and his wife Marja keep a heavy stick
with a handle made out of duct tape by the door, just in case.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know who's going to be out there,'' he said.

U.S. MEETS WITH KOSOVO REBEL LEADERS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States has held its first extended
discussions with senior political leaders of the Kosovo Liberation
Army, who committed themselves to abiding by a cease-fire in the
southern Serbian province if one can be negotiated, senior American
officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The American special envoy for Kosovo, Robert Gelbard, met two
officials of the political directorate of the rebel Liberation Army
for more than four hours on Friday, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The American officials refused to provide the names of the rebel
leaders or the city in Western Europe where they met, but said
Washington had verified their identity. Gelbard also informed
Ibrahim Rugova, the Kosovo Albanian leader, of the meeting in
advance, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA leaders agreed to work with Rugova and to ``cooperate
with him on a cease-fire and political negotiations, while
recognizing that for now, at least, they need to support his
leadership to try to provide a common negotiating position,'' one
senior American official said.
</P>
<P>
   But the rebel leaders are enormously skeptical of Rugova and his
advocacy of a nonviolent revolt against the government in Belgrade,
the American officials conceded.
</P>
<P>
   While supporting Rugova and his delegation, the Clinton
administration has come to understand that Rugova cannot speak for
the KLA, which has earned increasing support among ordinary ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo in the last six months as Serbian police and
military units have stepped up their operations in the province,
the American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   So Clinton has decided that a peaceful resolution of the crisis
in Kosovo, where Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is cracking
down on an independence movement among the ethnic Albanian
majority, requires the political participation of the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   The group's agreement is also vital, the officials said, to
negotiate and then carry out a cease-fire, since Milosevic
regularly says he cannot stop fighting because he has no guarantees
that the KLA would go along.
</P>
<P>
   For those reasons, the Americans decided they had to make
contact with the group, which Gelbard has criticized sharply in the
past for carrying out ``terrorist actions'' against noncombatant
civilians, mostly Serbs, in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to have a dialogue with these political leaders,'' a
senior American official said Saturday, describing the Gelbard
talks. ``The United States regards Dr. Rugova as the leader of a
very disparate group of Kosovar Albanian opinion, and his political
party is the largest in Kosovo. But clearly the KLA has become a
major force, and if we are going to be realistic, they need to be
brought into the process.''
</P>
<P>
   In the regular State Department briefing on Thursday, department
spokesman James Rubin said that he ``would expect there to be
political contact soon'' with the KLA, and that ``Milosevic is just
going to have to deal with that fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin was also careful not to refer to the KLA as a terrorist
organization, reflecting the new American view that it is ``an
insurgency,'' a senior official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The group has taken responsibility for attacks on the Serbian
police and on Albanians loyal to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Richard Holbrooke, shuttling in the region, met
with two Kosovo Liberation Army fighters in a village whom he said
he met by chance. In fact, Holbrooke's contacts with the military
wing, even at the village level, were also important in the
American effort to secure the group's cooperation with an
international observer force being set up for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The military men told Holbrooke, news accounts said, that they
would pass his comments on to higher officials in the organization.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, as Gelbard was meeting the political leaders, Serbian
Information Minister Aleksandar Vucic said in Belgrade that
Holbrooke had made ``a terrible diplomatic gaffe.''
</P>
<P>
   Vucic said Gelbard's meetings with the KLA fighters were
deliberate and represented ``the very proof that the U.S.
intelligence services and even the U.S. government are behind this
gang of Albanian separatists and terrorists.'' &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Bill Clinton is often perceived as a weak president
_ a lame duck dogged by scandal, thwarted at many turns by a
hostile Republican Congress. His campaign for tobacco-control
legislation foundered this month in the Senate. To top it off, the
Supreme Court last week denied him the power to kill specific items
in tax and spending bills by line item veto.
</P>
<P>
   But the perception of weakness is belied by a largely unnoticed
reality. Clinton is continually stretching his executive and
regulatory authority to put his stamp on policy. He has issued a
blizzard of executive orders, regulations, proclamations and other
decrees to achieve his goals, with or without the blessing of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1995, Clinton authorized the Food and Drug
Administration to declare nicotine an addictive drug, clearing the
way for the most significant government regulations in the history
of the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after the Senate killed a big anti-tobacco bill,
Clinton ordered a survey of cigarette smoking among teen-agers as a
way to identify those who market most effectively to underage
smokers. Such market research was a key part of the bill that died
in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   On a separate issue, Clinton last week ordered sweeping new
protections for Medicare beneficiaries. The rules not only carry
out a 1997 law, but go beyond it, adding many of the safeguards
proposed by a presidential advisory commission _ for women, for
people with serious illnesses and for patients who cannot speak
English.
</P>
<P>
   His critics say Clinton is legislating from the executive
branch, often in defiance of Congress. His supporters say he is
prodding, circumventing or overriding a do-nothing Congress that
refuses to address the nation's major problems.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents have used executive orders to work their will since
the earliest days of the Republic, with the boldest actions coming
in times of crisis. Lincoln freed the slaves by proclamation.
Franklin D. Roosevelt created new agencies and placed
Japanese-Americans in detention camps by executive order.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's more modest agenda is more suited to a time of peace
and prosperity. A self-declared policy wonk, he is passionately
interested in details of health, education and welfare programs
that touch the lives of millions.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say many of his initiatives are small-bore. Yet while
ridiculing or denouncing some of them, Congress acquiesces in
others to avoid tough decisions.
</P>
<P>
   To some, this raises separation-of-powers concerns echoing those
posed by the 1996 Line Item Veto Act, which was enacted in part to
give members of Congress political cover by allowing the president
to kill pork-barrel spending. The Supreme Court struck down the
statute last week, saying it violated the procedures set forth in
the Constitution for making law.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Taylor, director of natural resource studies at the Cato
Institute, says legislative authority has been ceded improperly to
the executive branch in other ways. ``This president distinguishes
himself from past presidents by the aggressiveness with which he
has expanded his authority without explicit congressional
approval,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main culprit is Congress, for letting the president get
away with this, and for delegating vague and broad discretionary
powers to the executive in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent speech, Taylor cited as one example
telecommunications legislation mandating that the poor have access
to the Internet and other forms of communication. Congress left the
details to the Federal Communications Commission, and when the FCC
came back to Congress to propose a tax on business to pay for such
``universal access,'' he said, legislators were ``shocked,
shocked'' at the proposed new spending.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Clinton boldly carries off his novel use of
presidential power, as when he tapped a special Treasury fund to
bail out Mexico in 1995, over the objections of Congress. And
sometimes he does not.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1995, Clinton issued an executive order that barred
federal agencies from signing contracts with companies that
permanently replaced striking workers. He said he was simply
exercising his power to set procurement policy for the government.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. Chamber of Commerce denounced the executive order
as a ``political payoff'' to organized labor, and the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia struck it down, saying the
president could not unilaterally ``alter the delicate balance of
bargaining and economic power'' set by Congress in the National
Labor Relations Act.
</P>
<P>
   In the realm of foreign affairs and national security, Clinton
takes ``an expansive view of presidential power over military
initiatives,'' said Louis Fisher, an expert on constitutional law
at the Congressional Research Service.
</P>
<P>
   Citing actions ordered by the president in Somalia, Haiti,
Bosnia and Iraq, Fisher said that ``Mr. Clinton's interpretation of
presidential war power would have astonished the framers of the
Constitution.'' Congress has substantial authority over foreign
affairs, Fisher said, but in recent decades it ``has failed to
protect its prerogatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has also stretched his appointment power. After the
Senate blocked the nomination of Bill Lann Lee to run the civil
rights division of the Justice Department, Clinton defiantly named
him acting assistant attorney general last December.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers at the Congressional Research Service say this
designation appears to violate an 1868 law, the Vacancies Act,
which in its current form sets a 120-day limit on such temporary
appointments. The administration disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said the administration was
flouting the law by using temporary appointments to fill 18 percent
of the 320 positions subject to Senate confirmation at various
departments. Without the 120-day limit, Byrd said, ``no president
need ever forward a nomination to the Senate.'' he preside
</P>
<P>
   One of Clinton's most spectacular unilateral actions came in
1996, on the rim of the Grand Canyon, when he designated 1.7
million acres of Utah's red rock country a national monument. The
step outraged Utah officials and many members of Congress, in part
because it limits development of the land. But Congress failed to
overturn the designation. And the rugged beauty of the area has
become a tourist attraction, as well as a monument to presidential
power.

<P>
   BOSTON _ When the Rev. Deborah Little holds a church service,
the ground beneath her congregation seems at times to tremble. But
that would be because the service _ a gathering of people who live
on the street, together with some who live in the suburbs _ takes
place on a busy corner of Boston Common above a subway line.
</P>
<P>
   As tourists pause to gawk, prayers are offered, hymns sung and
hugs exchanged, mainly among men and women on society's fringes.
This is Common Cathedral, a church without stained glass, bell or
roof, founded by Ms. Little, an Episcopal priest whose mission is
attending to the spiritual and physical needs of people who sleep
on park benches and in doorways.
</P>
<P>
   Every Sunday at 1 p.m. for the past two years, she has set up a
cross beside Brewer Fountain, near Tremont and Park streets, and
rolled up a wooden box that does triple duty as altar, kitchen and
clothes closet, providing space for communion at the service, a
counter to make sandwiches afterward and a place from which
clothing can be distributed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Christian tradition and others say if you want to get
closer to the heart of life, of God, go and be closer to the
poor,'' said Ms. Little, 53. ``I never envisioned myself being in a
traditional parish.''
</P>
<P>
   Tradition does not require a priest to urge people, at each
service, to take the ministry's phone number, in case they wind up
in the hospital or jail. But Ms. Little called out, ``We don't want
you to be alone.''
</P>
<P>
   People who come to Common Cathedral seem to appreciate that, as
they do its blend of liturgical structure and informality, evident
in Ms. Little's efforts to bring into the worship circle those
individuals whose battles with addiction or mental illness may
trigger bursts of exuberance or anger, as well as other homeless
people.
</P>
<P>
   For many who attend, the worship service ``is a stabilizing
force,'' said Harold James, 38, who said he began attending when he
was homeless. ``Some of us are proud to say we're domiciled today,
but some of us don't want to cut the connection.''
</P>
<P>
   Adil Hamza, 35, a Sudanese immigrant who came to be baptized,
said, ``They don't care if you have money, they don't care how you
dress.''
</P>
<P>
   Long before she graduated from General Theological Seminary in
New York, Ms. Little was by turns a reporter, an author and a
businesswoman. Upon her ordination as a deacon in the Diocese of
Massachusetts in 1994, she packed a knapsack with wool socks and
peanut-butter and jelly sandwiches to give away. ``I set out to see
what I could learn from people on the streets about who they are,
and what I could offer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Like many religious movements, Common Cathedral began with a
moment of inspiration. Two years ago, on Maundy Thursday, the date
on the Christian calendar that marks the anniversary of the Last
Supper, Ms. Little was crossing Boston Common after a foot-washing
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about the foot-washing, and about Jesus washing
people's feet,'' she said. ``And then the next thought was Jesus
always went to people. And my next thought was the church was where
people are.'' She decided she would celebrate Easter among the
homeless on the Common.
</P>
<P>
   She invited homeless people she knew, then borrowed a cross from
a church, and for an altar, a wheeled cart from the Episcopal
Cathedral of St. Paul. On the cart, she laid a piece of her
grandmother's table linen.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen people came. Driving away afterward, Ms. Little wondered
whether she might do it again the next Easter. But some of those
who had attended told her, ``See you Sunday.'' So Ms. Little
returned.
</P>
<P>
   These days, attendance typically tops 100, Ms. Little said. But
she is never sure who or how many will show up. Some of her
regulars may disappear for weeks, then turn up to say they had been
hospitalized or had even left the area. She has also picked up
supporters from suburban parishes, who feel inspired.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Jesus himself were with us in the flesh today, this is
where he would be, I feel,'' said Sarah Rossiter, who has been
coming to the services since she heard Ms. Little preach in her
suburban parish 18 months ago.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another visitor, on occasion, has been Bishop Thomas Shaw III of
Massachusetts, who last Christmas conducted confirmations of some
of the people who regularly attend Common Cathedral. Ms. Little, he
said, has a better rapport with the homeless ``than anyone I've run
into.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's deeply respectful of the people she ministers to,'' Shaw
said.
</P>
<P>
   Common Cathedral fits under the umbrella of a larger
organization Ms. Little founded, Ecclesia Ministries, which
collects and distributes clothing, trains volunteers in pastoral
care and brings groups of teen-agers into the city to learn about
the ministry. She raises most of the organization's $60,000 budget,
through donations; the diocese contributes $20,000 of the total.
</P>
<P>
   People often ask her what she hopes to accomplish. ``My main
goal is safety,'' she said. ``If somebody's unsafe to themselves or
others, we try to do something about it. We try to provide blankets
if it's cold, or to call an outreach worker or a van.''
</P>
<P>
   But she paused to ask, who is ministering to whom? The people
who come to Common Cathedral are among the poorest of the poor,
often too troubled to seek public aid. ``They're not poor in
spirit,'' Ms. Little said. ``I often ask people who God is, so I
can learn. And the most common response is, God is right out here.
They don't feel let down by God the way middle-class people do.''
</P>
<P>
   One of her regulars is Gary Huber, 44, a part-time carpenter who
lives in a pickup truck. Sitting on the grass after the service,
Huber recalled how Ms. Little brought him food on Christmas Eve
when the stores had closed and he had phoned for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have what you could call a certain affinity for her,'' Huber
said. ``The many times I was cold out here, she brought me clothes,
blankets.''

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After building a case that the IRS harasses and
intimidates taxpayers, Congress wrapped up work last week on a
bipartisan bill to rein in the agency. Taxpayers will get more
legal protections when they get into disputes with the IRS The
agency will now have to operate under the eye of an outside board,
and it will be prodded to undertake a reorganization intended to
make it more customer-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   There is almost no one in Congress who thinks any of this is a
bad idea, and President Clinton is eager to sign the bill, which
cleared the House 402-8 on Thursday and will come to Senate floor
early next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill will give every American a fighting chance when the
tax man comes a-knocking,'' said House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Yet history suggests that a few years from now, Congress will be
holding another set of hearings, asking why the IRS is not doing a
better job of collecting all the tax revenue the government is
owed.
</P>
<P>
   Members of both parties will bemoan the increasing lack of
compliance and note that if the IRS could just collect a fraction
of the money lost to evasion, Congress could finance bigger tax
cuts or more preschool programs or another wing of fighter planes.
And few politicians will stop to ask whether Congress itself may
have gone too far in 1998 in defanging the IRS or in portraying the
tax-collection agency as populated by jack-booted thugs intent on
driving honest citizens to despair or worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a constant tension between effective tax
administration and the perception the public has of an overbearing
tax authority,'' said Gregory F. Jenner, a tax policy expert at the
Coopers &AMP; Lybrand financial services company in Washington. ``That
tension has existed since the dawn of time and we are now seeing
the pendulum swing toward one extreme.''
</P>
<P>
   The IRS has clearly mistreated some taxpayers, failed to provide
quick, accurate answers to people befuddled by their forms and
generally earned its standing as the most-loathed arm of the
government.
</P>
<P>
   But in bashing the IRS so relentlessly, Congress has created at
least the risk of aggravating other problems, not least public
faith in a system that relies largely on self-assessment and
voluntary compliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of negative publicity about tax enforcement can't
help but hurt collection efforts,'' said Joseph Thorndike, head of
the tax history project at Tax Analysts, a non-profit publishing
company. ``That might be a price worth paying if there are in fact
serious problems within their collection activities. But it won't
be cost free.''
</P>
<P>
   One way to measure the cost is the $13 billion price tag
attached to the bill by Congress, much of which is money that won't
be collected as a result of the new protections granted to
taxpayers. Divorced or separated people who claim ignorance of tax
evasion by their former spouses, for example, will win protections
that the bill values at $1.6 billion over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said it is wrong to think of the revenue as lost,
since by the bill's definition the government would no longer have
any claim on it. Still, some provisions could, as a White House
analysis put it, ``unintentionally make it easier for noncompliant
taxpayers to avoid paying their fair share of taxes.'' And tax
evasion is already a huge problem.
</P>
<P>
   IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti told the Senate Finance
Committee last month that the tax ``gap'' _ the difference between
the revenue actually collected by the federal government and what
Washington figures the actual total tax bill should be _ is running
at about $195 billion a year. That is about 11.5 percent of the
expected $1.7 trillion federal budget next year and roughly double
the last estimate, in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   During much of the 1980s, closing the tax gap was a much bigger
issue than IRS excesses. Democrats called the Reagan administration
to task for slashing too deeply into the IRS budget, and wanted
more effort expended on making sure the rich could not so easily
use both legal and illegal tax dodges. Republicans and Democrats
alike saw tightening up on tax collection as a politically easy way
to mitigate the pain of ever-mounting budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
   For some years now, the pendulum has been swinging back toward
taxpayer protection. Under pressure from Congress, the IRS dropped
a program under which it randomly selected a cross-section of
taxpayers and subjected them to intense audits as a way of getting
a handle on how much cheating was going on.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the swing is the improvement in the government's
finances, which has removed the pressure to scrounge for new
revenue. Another is the ascendancy in Congress of the Republicans,
some of whom see attacking the IRS as a way of softening up public
opinion for the bigger goal of overhauling the tax system. But the
biggest reason may be that in the absence of any compelling reason
to do otherwise, members of Congress are going to heed the
complaints of their constituents. And few subjects bring so many
complaints as taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem with the tax system,'' said Sheldon Cohen,
who was IRS commissioner during the late 1960s, ``is that Congress
responds to a sad story.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After building a case that the IRS harasses and
intimidates taxpayers, Congress wrapped up work last week on a
bipartisan bill to rein in the agency. Taxpayers will get more
legal protections when they get into disputes with the IRS The
agency will now have to operate under the eye of an outside board,
and it will be prodded to undertake a reorganization intended to
make it more customer-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   There is almost no one in Congress who thinks any of this is a
bad idea, and President Clinton is eager to sign the bill, which
cleared the House 402-8 on Thursday and will come to Senate floor
early next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill will give every American a fighting chance when the
tax man comes a-knocking,'' said House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Yet history suggests that a few years from now, Congress will be
holding another set of hearings, asking why the IRS is not doing a
better job of collecting all the tax revenue the government is
owed.
</P>
<P>
   Members of both parties will bemoan the increasing lack of
compliance and note that if the IRS could just collect a fraction
of the money lost to evasion, Congress could finance bigger tax
cuts or more preschool programs or another wing of fighter planes.
And few politicians will stop to ask whether Congress itself may
have gone too far in 1998 in defanging the IRS or in portraying the
tax-collection agency as populated by jack-booted thugs intent on
driving honest citizens to despair or worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a constant tension between effective tax
administration and the perception the public has of an overbearing
tax authority,'' said Gregory F. Jenner, a tax policy expert at the
Coopers &AMP; Lybrand financial services company in Washington. ``That
tension has existed since the dawn of time and we are now seeing
the pendulum swing toward one extreme.''
</P>
<P>
   The IRS has clearly mistreated some taxpayers, failed to provide
quick, accurate answers to people befuddled by their forms and
generally earned its standing as the most-loathed arm of the
government.
</P>
<P>
   But in bashing the IRS so relentlessly, Congress has created at
least the risk of aggravating other problems, not least public
faith in a system that relies largely on self-assessment and
voluntary compliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of negative publicity about tax enforcement can't
help but hurt collection efforts,'' said Joseph Thorndike, head of
the tax history project at Tax Analysts, a non-profit publishing
company. ``That might be a price worth paying if there are in fact
serious problems within their collection activities. But it won't
be cost free.''
</P>
<P>
   One way to measure the cost is the $13 billion price tag
attached to the bill by Congress, much of which is money that won't
be collected as a result of the new protections granted to
taxpayers. Divorced or separated people who claim ignorance of tax
evasion by their former spouses, for example, will win protections
that the bill values at $1.6 billion over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said it is wrong to think of the revenue as lost,
since by the bill's definition the government would no longer have
any claim on it. Still, some provisions could, as a White House
analysis put it, ``unintentionally make it easier for noncompliant
taxpayers to avoid paying their fair share of taxes.'' And tax
evasion is already a huge problem.
</P>
<P>
   IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti told the Senate Finance
Committee last month that the tax ``gap'' _ the difference between
the revenue actually collected by the federal government and what
Washington figures the actual total tax bill should be _ is running
at about $195 billion a year. That is about 11.5 percent of the
expected $1.7 trillion federal budget next year and roughly double
the last estimate, in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   During much of the 1980s, closing the tax gap was a much bigger
issue than IRS excesses. Democrats called the Reagan administration
to task for slashing too deeply into the IRS budget, and wanted
more effort expended on making sure the rich could not so easily
use both legal and illegal tax dodges. Republicans and Democrats
alike saw tightening up on tax collection as a politically easy way
to mitigate the pain of ever-mounting budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
   For some years now, the pendulum has been swinging back toward
taxpayer protection. Under pressure from Congress, the IRS dropped
a program under which it randomly selected a cross-section of
taxpayers and subjected them to intense audits as a way of getting
a handle on how much cheating was going on.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the swing is the improvement in the government's
finances, which has removed the pressure to scrounge for new
revenue. Another is the ascendancy in Congress of the Republicans,
some of whom see attacking the IRS as a way of softening up public
opinion for the bigger goal of overhauling the tax system. But the
biggest reason may be that in the absence of any compelling reason
to do otherwise, members of Congress are going to heed the
complaints of their constituents. And few subjects bring so many
complaints as taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem with the tax system,'' said Sheldon Cohen,
who was IRS commissioner during the late 1960s, ``is that Congress
responds to a sad story.''

CHURCH, STATE AND SCHOOL: HOLES IN THE WALL OF SEPRATION

<P>
   After a substitute teacher in a New York City public school led
11-year-old pupils in prayer and asked them to accept Jesus Christ
as their savior, the Board of Education dismissed her this month.
In the words of the board's spokeswoman, the teacher ``had very
clearly crossed the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Who could argue? If the separation of church and state mandated
by the First Amendment means anything, surely it bars state-paid
teachers from evangelizing to public schoolchildren in
state-provided classrooms during school hours.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the fired teacher, Mildred Rosario, has become a minor hero
to some. Parents, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and even the
Republican congressional leadership have complained that, at a time
when public schools are littered with needles and condoms, to fire
a teacher for leading prayers is incomprehensible.
</P>
<P>
   The episode is an apt reminder that 36 years after the Supreme
Court banned school prayer, there is no consensus on the
appropriate links between government and religion, particularly
within the school system.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after Ms. Rosario's prayer, another storm over church,
state and schoolhouse erupted after a decision by the Wisconsin
Supreme Court. It ruled that Milwaukee could spend taxpayer money
to send pupils to religious schools through a voucher system.
</P>
<P>
   Civil liberties advocates and teacher unions expressed shock
that the court would permit state financing of institutions devoted
to religious teaching.
</P>
<P>
   But government aid to religious instruction has existed
throughout U.S. history. Through most of the 19th century, public
schools routinely taught the Bible. And even in this century, when
the wall of separation became commonly invoked, religious schoools
have received substantial state subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1947, when the Supreme Court permitted New Jersey to
reimburse parochial school parents for the use of public school
buses, large amounts of government money have gone to
church-sponsored institutions. Not only are church properties
tax-exempt _ no small matter in places like Manhattan _ but
parochial school parents in some states get tax breaks for tuition,
and the equivalent of public vouchers are widely used in church
preschools and colleges. Churches and their schools have, of
course, always benefitted from state-financed police and fire
protection.
</P>
<P>
   The devil has been in the details.
</P>
<P>
   Parochial schools may use state-provided buses for
transportation to classes but not for field trips; state-paid
nurses may work at the schools but state-paid guidance counselors
may not; the state may lend parochial schools textbooks but not
audio-visual aids or maps (a distinction that led Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., to quip that the next big challenge would
be atlases, which are books of maps). For years, public remedial
teachers could serve parochial students only in trailers, a
decision that the High Court reversed last year, thereby permitting
the state teachers to enter the schools.
</P>
<P>
   Religious display rulings have been even more tortured. A city
may erect a creche at Christmas or a menorah at Hanukkah on
condition that it is surrounded by enough other seasonal symbols,
like reindeer or plastic candy canes, to blunt its religious
message.
</P>
<P>
   As bizarre as some of these distinctions may sound, they emerged
from numerous cases over half a century. Most rulings came from
divided courts and each established a slightly different set of
criteria for interpreting the First Amendment's command that
``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the founders' history _ they were running from regimes
that imposed religion _ it is no accident that religious freedom
leads the list of rights Congress is forbidden to abridge, or that
on its heels come speech and assembly. But the three form a nexus
of individual liberty that is exceedingly difficult to disentangle.
Shifting criteria reflect shifting legal and political climates as
well as shifting Supreme Court personnel.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it was Justice Hugo Black who wrote the 5-4 opinion
in 1947 permitting New Jersey to reimburse parents for sending
their children to parochial schools on public transportation. He
said the First Amendment ``requires the state to be neutral in its
relations with groups of religious believers and nonbelievers.'' He
added: ``It does not require the state to be their adversary. State
power is no more to be used so as to handicap religions, than it is
to favor them.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later, in a case from New York state, Justice Byron
White wrote a 6-3 decision permitting the state to lend textbooks
to parochial schools, saying the books were secular and would not
be used for religious instruction. But Black, whose broad
interpretation of the First Amendment had helped White craft that
decision, dissented, saying there was a distinction between aid for
things like transportation and lunch, which were nonsubstantive,
and textbooks, which could be related to religious views.
</P>
<P>
   And even though textbook loans were permitted, a decision in the
1970s barred the lending of instructional materials, including
maps, to parochial schools ``because of the predominantly religious
character of the schools.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, the court barred public school teachers from performing
remedial work in parochial schools. Among the dissenters was
Associate Justice William H. Rehnquist, the future chief justice,
who was instrumental in the 1997 ruling overturning that decision.
</P>
<P>
   The back-and-forth on these questions suggests that if the
Wisconsin voucher decision is accepted for review by the Supreme
Court, something both sides say they want, the chances of a clear
ruling seem small. Four other states have similar cases pending and
voucher systems are rapidly spreading across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the fear that such programs would denude the public
schools of motivated pupils and much-needed cash, the concern of
those opposed to the voucher program has been that if government is
seen to endorse one religion, that religion has an unfair advantage
over others.
</P>
<P>
   The founders actually banned government endorsement largely for
a different reason. They feared state involvement would sully
religion, not help it.
</P>
<P>
   Black relied on that view when he wrote that the First Amendment
``rested on the belief that a union of government and religion
tends to destroy government and to degrade religion.'' He added
that the history of established religion ``showed that many people
lost their respect for any religion that had relied upon the
support of government to spread its faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for a lowered wall of separation invoke the founders
frequently, saying they never planned for government to be a force
for atheism. That is true, but the founders insisted on religious
freedom, mindful of something else: the danger of sectarian battle.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that there appears little risk of a return to the
religious wars of an earlier era. But a contemporary version _ a
battle between religious and secular forces for control of public
and educational life _ does not seem out of the question.

DEMOCRATS IN FLORIDA SEEK RACIAL MEDIATOR  
 SENATOR HIRES HELPERS FOR ELECTION IN 2000  
 WASHINGTON STATE GOP FINED OVER SPENDING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES JR.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The racial rift between white and black Democrats in Florida has
become so serious that some members of the state's congressional
delegation are urging President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore
to intervene as peacemakers before the split damages Democratic
chances in both the 1998 governor's race and the 2000 presidential
race.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Sen. Bob Graham and Rep. Alcee Hastings of Broward
County warned the White House of the growing political danger of
the simmering months-old split, which traces to an incident in
which white Democrats in the state House of Representatives removed
a black Democrat, Willie Logan of Opa-Locka, from a top leadership
post, asserting that he was ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings, perhaps the most prominent black politician in
Florida, delivered his warning in person at a private meeting with
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some work to do,'' he said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   On several occasions before the meeting, Hastings warned that if
white legislators did not apologize and make amends for the Logan
incident _ he insisted Logan was an effective legislator _ he and
other black leaders in Florida might urge black voters to cast
their lot with Republicans or stay away from the polls in future
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, who is white, did not go to the White House with
Hastings but suggested separately that perhaps the president or
vice president, or both, could somehow ``contribute to bringing
harmony back to the Democratic Party.'' He said that ``looking
toward the year 2000,'' a presidential election year, Gore had a
special stake in seeing that the Logan dispute was resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's office said that Gore told Hastings that
everything possible would be done to help ``bridge that rift.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many Southern states, Florida has been leaning more
Republican in recent years. Without strong support from the state's
large black population, Democrats have little hope of capturing the
governorship _ their candidate this year already trails badly _ or
of making off in 2000 with the state's big basket of 25 Electoral
College votes.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Hires Helpers for Election in 2000
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the dozen or so Republicans and Democrats who are
exploring the possibility of running for president in 2000, Sen.
Bob Kerrey has unpaid volunteers working and scouting for him in
the early caucus and primary states, particularly Iowa and New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   And like many of the White House wannabes, Kerrey, D-Neb., also
has a political action committee, Bacpac, that helps promote
favorite causes (not the least being Kerrey) in significant
Election 2000 states, and also helps elect like-thinking state and
local officials in those states (help that presumably would be
repaid in kind should the senator ultimately run for president).
</P>
<P>
   But unlike other presidential ponderers, Kerrey recently began
to sign up professional, paid field workers for his exploration
effort, a sure sign that he is trying to break to the front of the
pack and is ``elevating'' his interest in national politics, as one
of his aides put it.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, he has hired Steve Bouchard, a former state
legislative aide, to be his main political point man and chief
representative of Bacpac, formally known as the Building America's
Conscience Political Action Committee. He also has hired Chris
Sterndale, who worked for him in New Hampshire in 1992 when he
first ran for president.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Kerrey aides say, field workers will be hired in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Washington GOP Fined Over Spending
</P>
<P>
   Going into the 1996 fall election, Republicans in Washington
state, already in control of the state House of Representatives,
figured they had a good shot at also taking over the 49-seat state
Senate, then in Democratic control by only one seat. But it would
take money.
</P>
<P>
   So the GOP poured in the cash. It hired consultants, set up
political action committees and provided major backing to the
Republican candidates who looked in the best positions to defeat
Democrats running for the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The plan worked. The Republican Party came out of the election
in control of the Senate, 26-23 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Now, almost two years later, it turns out that some of the
Republican spending was in serious violation of the state's
campaign-finance regulations.
</P>
<P>
   After an investigation by the Public Disclosure Commission, the
bipartisan panel that monitors elections in Washington state, the
party has conceded that it spent about $30,000 more than the law
allowed on five Senate races, that it accepted more than $30,000 in
improper contributions to its political action committees and that
it improperly dipped into a restricted fund for about $150,000 to
pay for polls and political consultants.
</P>
<P>
   As reparation, the party has agreed to pay a $5,000 fine and to
reduce its aid to candidates in the 1998 elections by about
$150,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Public Disclosure Commission also found that the party
``apparently'' violated state campaign law in 1996 by taking
$150,000 from a restricted fund to finance a television
advertisement attacking Gary Locke, the Democratic candidate for
governor who went on to win. That finding, which the GOP disputes,
has been forwarded to the state attorney general for possible
action.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, while pleased with the commission's findings, are
incensed that it imposed a fine of only $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking into the possibility of going to court,'' Paul
Berendt, the Democratic state chairman, said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Would his party also try to have the 1996 elections results
thrown out, given that they cost Democrats control of the Senate?
</P>
<P>
   ``Too late for that,'' Berendt said. ``But the next election is
just a few months away, and we've got high hopes for a comeback.''

ITALY BEATS NORWAY, 1-0 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSEILLES, France _ It is always excruciating to play against
Norway, which compacts its players in defense as if they are posing
for a team picture. To prevail requires vigilance and patience and
quick precision.
</P>
<P>
   In the 18th minute of their World Cup elimination match
Saturday, Italy unfurled a counterattack through the heart of the
Norway defense, and Christian Vieri sprinted down the middle like
the tight end he resembles. Midfielder Luigi Di Biagio chipped the
ball ahead and Vieri kept bulling forward with the momentum of an
avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Eggen, a sapling of a defender, fell away under this
muscular charge and Vieri stroked a diagonal shot that skidded past
the helpless dive of Norway's goalkeeper, Frode Grodas, and nestled
accurately inside the left post. It was the only goal Italy would
score Saturday in a 1-0 victory, but any goal against Norway
requires hard work and is to be valued. Ask Brazil, which lost by
2-1 to Norway on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Vieri now has five goals in this World Cup, more than any other
player, and Saturday he advanced his team toward a likely meeting
with France next Friday in the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rather play Brazil than France,'' said the Italian
goalie, Gianluca Pagliuca, who avoided the first potential
sudden-death overtime match in World Cup history with a magnificent
save in the 71st minute. ``France has their fans behind them and
they are playing better than Brazil.''
</P>
<P>
   There is an urgent feeling among the Italians, who won in Group
B in the first round, that they will need a rejuvenated Alessandro
Del Piero as Vieri's partner at forward to have any chance of
winning a fourth World Cup. Del Piero finished fourth among Italian
League scorers this season with 21 goals for Juventus, but he
strained a groin muscle before the World Cup and has yet to score
in soccer's world championship.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of Roberto Baggio from Saturday's game was seen by
some as an effort by Coach Cesare Maldini to keep Del Piero's
brittle confidence from shattering. Another goal by Baggio, another
rescue, and, the theory goes, Del Piero's self-assurance might be
irretrievably lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to play, but I'm not going to make a big deal of
it,'' Baggio said.
</P>
<P>
   Baggio did not score a goal in the first round of the 1994 World
Cup before exploding for two against Nigeria. And Paolo Rossi did
not score until the fifth match of the 1982 World Cup when Italy
won its last title. So there is time to get Del Piero kick-started.
He missed three chances Saturday; perhaps he is thinking too much,
or perhaps he is too concerned with making the goals look pretty
instead of being concerned only with putting them into the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is that he had chances to score,'' Vieri
said of Del Piero. ``The problems are when he doesn't have
chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Vieri, who looks like George Clooney but does not need a Batman
costume for superheroic performances, appears to have all the
confidence that Del Piero lacks. He is mobile and relentless; give
him a chance to score and he does. Perhaps Vieri, 24, is not
feeling the same pressure as Del Piero, because he plays in Spain,
for Atletico Madrid, and he escaped the loud volume of the World
Cup buildup.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a former Torino midfielder, Vieri grew up in
Australia where his father finished his career. He returned to
Italy at 15 and played for runner-up Juventus in the 1997 European
Champions League Cup. But Juventus maintains a ``win-and-sell''
policy, and Vieri was transferred last summer to Atletico Madrid
for $16 million. Still, he scored the vital goal in Italy's playoff
qualifier against Russia, and is now filling the net again in the
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had hoped there would be more opportunities to score goals
than there were today,'' Vieri said.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but it is almost impossible to excavate a goal when Norway,
as is its maddening custom, plays 10 or 11 men behind the ball.
Vieri managed an early puncture and then it was Italy's defense
that became inpenetrable.
</P>
<P>
   Norway, which finished second to Brazil in Group A, insisted on
maintaining Tore Andre Flo as its lone striker, but his teammates
had great difficulty delivering the ball. The Italian defenders,
Fabio Cannavaro and Giuseppe Bergomi, stood on either side of Flo
all day like federal agents guarding a fugitive. Bergomi, a
holdover from Italy's 1982 team, used all his experience to
distract Flo with timely shoves in the back. And Cannavaro, though
a head shorter than the 6-foot-5-inch Norwegian, repeatedly used
his leverage to knock Flo off the ball.
</P>
<P>
   But Flo is as persistent as Vieri, and in the 71st minute, he
shoved through an Italian defender and headed a cross toward
Pagliuca, who instinctively stuck out his right hand and then
trapped the ball against his body.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't impressed with Italy,'' said Norway Coach Egil Olsen.
</P>
<P>
   No one looks impressive against Norway. Still, Italy beat Norway
four days after Brazil could not.

   AIDS Now Rivals Historic Epidemics
</P>
<P>
   AIDS has spread so widely around the world that it now compares
with the great epidemics of history, the United Nations reported.
In parts of Africa, one in four adults is infected with the AIDS
virus.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 30 million people were infected with the virus, HIV,
and 21 million of them were in Africa, according to the United
Nations report, the first to provide a country-by-country analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The report paints the gloomiest pictures of the HIV epidemic
since it was first recognized in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   The Black Death of the Middle Ages killed 20 million people in
four years and the influenza pandemic of 1918-1919, after World War
I, killed 20 million.

   High Court Broadens Grounds For Harassment Suits
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled that an employee who resists a
supervisor's advances can pursue a sexual harassment lawsuit even
if he or she suffered no career setbacks because of the harassment.
</P>
<P>
   But such a lawsuit cannot succeed, the court said, if the
company has an anti-harassment policy with an effective complaint
procedure and the employee has unreasonably failed to use it.
</P>
<P>
   In a 7-to-2 decision, the court said Kimberly Ellerth, of
Belvidere, Ill., should have an opportunity to prove to a court
that her former employer, Burlington Industries, violated her civil
rights even though she was neither fired nor demoted. Ms. Ellerth
quit her job about two months after she was recommended for a
promotion.

   Court Calls HIV a Disability, And Rules on Arts Grants  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The court also ruled that people with HIV infections need not
have any symptoms of disease or obvious impairment in order to be
covered by the federal law that bars discrimination on the basis of
disability. It was a major victory for people with the virus that
causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Voting 5-4, the justices agreed with a federal appeals court's
ruling that a woman with asymptomatic HIV infection, who was
refused care in a dentist's office, met the definition of
disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   In a case involving the National Endowment for the Arts, the
court upheld a congressional decency test for awarding grants, but
only after a majority interpreted a 1990 law as containing only
``advisory language'' that did not actually prohibit subsidies for
indecent art. In fact, the court strongly suggested that the law
could violate the First Amendment.

   White House Renews Contract Preferences
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the Supreme Court held that many of the
government's programs granting preferences based on race or sex
were unconstitutional. The Clinton administration began searching
for an approach that retained affirmative action in government
contracts while satisfying constitutional requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Now the White House has come up with a new policy.
Minority-owned businesses will be given an advantage in bidding in
industries like trucking where statistical surveys show they are
underrepresented. But in industries like food processing where they
seem to be getting a fair share, there will be no affirmative
action.

<P>
   Susan Molinari's bid to transform herself into the next Katie

   Nine months after Ms. Molinari, the former congresswoman from
New York, began a new career as co-host of ``CBS News Saturday
Morning,'' she and CBS News have split.
</P>
<P>
   Her side says CBS _ leery of criticism that a neutral news
program would become a forum for a partisan politician _ tried to
steer the cheery Republican into home-and-garden chat and away from
important issues. CBS News president Andrew Heyward said she would
fare better as a political commentator, but had no such job to

   Hey! I'm Trying to Sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Try, if you can, to recall the olden days of train travel.
Passengers read or slept, laughed or wept, conversed softly,
perhaps wrote novels. They may have yearned to call home or office,
but, they survived.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the cell phone, and a simple trip became a minefield of
little emergencies. The train's late, the dinner's cold, the
meeting's canceled, Junior has the flu. On New York's Metro-North
recently, a man engaged in oh-so-solemn discussion of the evening's
wine choice.
</P>
<P>
   And for some reason that modern science has yet to fathom,
callers send these vital bulletins in booming, resonant tones.
</P>
<P>
   Now some riders, understandably, balk at having their cocoon
invaded. A group called the Long Island Rail Road Commuters Council
has started a campaign to promote greater courtesy, featuring a
contest for cartoons or slogans to make the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be viewed as disciplinarians,'' said Larry
Silverman, the council's chairman. ``Often it's not a lack of
courtesy so much as a lack of awareness'' _ awareness that you
don't have to yell into the things. Whatever it is, it's a growing
nuisance; the council said cell-phone abuse was a top complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the answer is a modern-day echo of the no-smoking car:
the no-phone car. Just as you used to pass from clear air to
choking haze, now you could go from a sea of serene readers into a
cacophony of ``Sell 300 shares!'' ``The '92 cabernet, of course!''
and ``The kids did what??!!''

   Taking a Stand for the Ultra-Rich
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer has used his influence as chairman of the House
Ways and Means Committee to preserve an inheritance tax break for a
few wealthy people that no one, not even Archer, intended to be in
the law in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   He makes no apologies. ``Death taxes,'' says Archer, a Texas
Republican who represents one of the country's wealthiest
districts, are confiscatory and unfair. Just because a tax cut got
on the books accidentally is no reason to get rid of it.
</P>
<P>
   The word in Republican circles is that Archer was encouraged,
perhaps instructed, to take his stand by House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, another opponent of estate taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The only beneficiaries of the mistake are the heirs of a few
hundred people who die each year and leave estates worth more than
$17 million. Each of those estates will be spared more than
$200,000 in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The cost to the government in lost revenue: $880 million over
the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The tax break resulted from an error by someone on Congress'
technical staff in the drafting of last year's balanced-budget and
tax-cut law. Drafting mistakes are commonplace in big, complicated
tax bills. When they are caught, they are normally corrected in the
next tax bill without much opposition.
</P>
<P>
   That is what everyone expected to happen this time. But Archer
blocked the correction. Since no one felt as strongly about fixing
the error as he felt about leaving it uncorrected, a few rich
families are even richer.

WHEN SOSA SETS A GOAL, WATCH OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Together for the first three years of their professional
careers, they saw their paths diverge for a decade only to merge
again this year. Sammy Sosa and Juan Gonzalez play for different
teams, indeed in different leagues, but they are together again in
the so-far-successful pursuit of the primary goals they set last
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa has shattered a home run record that not even Mark McGwire
could reach, but the ``3'' at the start of his batting average is
at least as impressive. ``Sammy told me several times, `I want to
hit .300,''' said Jeff Pentland, the Chicago Cubs' hitting coach.
``He said, `I did it once, and I want to do it again.' I've learned
in dealing with the talent I've been lucky to deal with that if
they make a statement, you have to believe in what they say they're
going to do. When these guys set their minds to it, that's what
results.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez set his mind to a different kind of goal. ``Juan has
set some high personal goals for himself,'' said Doug Melvin, the
Texas Rangers' general manager. ``Staying healthy and playing every
day is probably the No. 1 goal he set out to achieve. He's done
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering Saturday, Sosa was hitting .328, and Gonzalez, his
teammate from Sarasota, Gastonia, Charlotte and Tulsa when both
were in the Texas organization, had played in every one of the
Rangers' 79 games.
</P>
<P>
   It was no secret that Gonzalez would produce impressive
statistics if he avoided injury, which had forced him to miss 112
of 469 games the past three seasons. In those years, he drove in a
total of 357 runs in 357 games. This year, he has performed even
more productively.
</P>
<P>
   In his first 79 games, Gonzalez drove in 96 runs, stirring talk
of the pursuit of the record for runs batted in (190) as a subplot
to the chase for the home run record.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa planted himself firmly in the latter race with a torrent of
home runs this month. But the home runs did not detract from his
.300 goal. During a 22-game stretch in which he hit 21 home runs
(May 25 to June 21), Sosa batted .352.
</P>
<P>
   In his first eight seasons in the major leagues, Sosa batted
.300 only once, finishing precisely at that level in 1994. Had it
not been for the players' strike that ended that season
prematurely, Sosa would very likely have fallen below that mark.
His highest average otherwise was .273, which he hit in 1996, and
his career average before this season was .257.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sammy and I sat down in the winter and put together some
goals,'' said Pentland, who joined the Cubs last July. ``I said 100
walks and 100 runs scored, and Sammy threw in .300. He was vehement
about it. We made out a plan to accomplish that goal. We didn't
talk about home runs, and we didn't talk about RBIs.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa ``had a burning desire to be as good as he could be,''
Pentland said. ``That's one of the ingredients you need to reach
greatness.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa also needed to do a better job of reading and recognizing
pitches, shorten his swing ``and try not to hit the ball 700
feet,'' Pentland said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy Williams did a great job with his swing,'' Pentland
said, referring to the team's dugout coach. ``My job was to make
him aware of how good he could be.''
</P>
<P>
   Pentland described Sosa as a very emotional person. ``The idea
is to channel that,'' Pentland said. ``Last year he wasn't happy. I
never found out any reasons, but we guessed that the burden he felt
he had to carry was part of it. There were some petty jealousies on
the club. When a team is losing, people tend to point fingers, and
a lot of the time he felt the finger was pointed at him.''
</P>
<P>
   The final element in the evolution of this .300 hitter, Pentland
explained, was the need for Sosa to evaluate himself daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never did it consistently,'' the coach said. ``Now he's
maintaining it. He understands himself better. I've hardly said
five words. I just listen. He's saying all the right things, and
it's showing up on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   The self-evaluation, Pentland said, comes when he and Sosa work
in a batting cage for about 10 minutes each day. ``He'll talk about
the game the day before, what he did, how he could have done
better,'' Pentland said. ``His breakdowns are right on the mark.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez also works daily on achieving his goal of staying
healthy and playing every game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in great shape,'' Melvin said. ``When the team is at
home, he works out every morning at the park at 11:30, then goes
home and rests. He comes back to the park later. On the road, he's
always in the health club. His work habits are great.''
</P>
<P>
   The injuries that have undermined Gonzalez's seasons are not
always avoidable through hard work. Last year, for example, he tore
a thumb ligament diving for a ball in a winter league playoff game
and missed the first 24 games of the Rangers' season. But every
time he drives in a run this season, he reminds everyone what a
healthy Gonzalez can do.
</P>
<P>
   In driving in 96, he had nearly lapped the field. The next
highest total in the American League was Ken Griffey Jr.'s 70. Even
McGwire, the National League leader, was 12 behind. But before
those making projections say Gonzalez is on a pace for a
record-breaking 195, it should be recalled that Hack Wilson, en
route to his total of 190 in 1930, drove in 53 runs in the Cubs' 30
games in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that's helped Juan with RBIs is having them as a
goal instead of home runs,'' Melvin said. ``He doesn't go up trying
to hit home runs. Once he got off to a great start with RBIs and
there was that focus, he became a better hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   The general manager cited two recent examples of the kind of
hitter Gonzalez has become.
</P>
<P>
   In a 7-7 game with Colorado, the Rangers had a runner at third
base in the ninth inning, and Gonzalez had two strikes. ``The pitch
was inside, and everybody was thinking he was going to try to hit
the ball over the fence,'' Melvin said. ``But he inside-outed it to
right-center for a single.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Anaheim, the Rangers had the bases loaded with two out
and again two strikes on Gonzalez, and he drove an outside pitch
into the right-center gap. ``If he was chasing the home run title
or trying to hit home runs,'' Melvin said, ``he might try to pull
the outside pitch. He sees those are RBIs, and he gets RBIs by
using the whole field.''
</P>
<P>
   He does it, too, by using the whole schedule.

RECORDS BY MONTH  
 BUILDING A FLORIDA RIVALRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Much noise was made last week when Sammy Sosa hit his 19th home
run in June, breaking the record for home runs in a month. So when
did they start playing baseball by calendar months?
</P>
<P>
   In other words, there is nothing sacred about a period running
from the first day of a month to the last. But if one wishes to use
a 30-day period as a barometer for hot home run streaks, how about
the 21 that Sosa hit from May 22 through June 20?
</P>
<P>
   No one in history, the Elias Sports Bureau determined, had ever
hit that many home runs in any 30-day span. The previous high was
20. Ralph Kiner of Pittsburgh hit 20 in 1947, from Aug. 14 through
Sept. 12, and Roger Maris of the Yankees duplicated the feat in his
record-breaking year of 1961, from May 24 through June 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a much more powerful statement than home runs in a
specific month,'' Steve Hirdt of Elias said.
</P>
<P>
   Even more powerfully, Sosa hit 21 home runs in a 28-day period,
from May 25 through June 21. Those were the same 21 home runs he
hit in 22 games, having missed three games during his productive
30- and 27-day periods.
</P>
<P>
   BUILDING A RIVALRY
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Marlins and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays are Florida's
only major league teams, but they apparently do not fit the
definition of a natural rivalry. At least their fans don't think
so.
</P>
<P>
   They played two games in each team's park last week and drew the
fewest fans of the nine four-game home-and-home series that were
played as part of the interleague schedule. The games in St.
Petersburg attracted 53,146; those in Miami drew 36,327. Vincent
Naimoli, the Devil Rays' managing partner, acknowledged that his
team should have promoted the Tampa Bay games more aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   Can the rivalry be built?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Naimoli said, ``we can do a lot of things from a
marketing standpoint, create a state championship trophy, something
like that. Because of other priorities, we didn't do a real
effective job this time. As time goes on, we'll do better.''
</P>
<P>
   The average attendance for each team's pair of games was below
the average for other games this season. The only other teams that
drew a smaller average than they had for their other games were
Texas and Arizona, who also played each other.
</P>
<P>
   The largest four-game attendance was 206,123 for the Yankees and
the Atlanta Braves. The Montreal Expos had 25,771 for their two
games with their Canadian rival Toronto, but the average was higher
than their previous average of 10,767.

   MEVASSERET ZION, Israel _ Through the centuries of dispersion,
Jews affirmed the faith that they would eventually return to Zion
by declaring, ``Next year in Jerusalem!''
</P>
<P>
   But the ancient vow has taken on an unwelcome new meaning for
residents of this sylvan suburb, and others scattered through the
hills west of Jerusalem, that Israel's government wants to annex to
the Holy City.
</P>
<P>
   Having established themselves in Zion's secular prosperity, the
suburbanites here want no part of the Holy City's politics, taxes _
and, most of all, its increasing emphasis on religion.
</P>
<P>
   Their passions were fired last week by the announcement of a
government plan ``for strengthening of Jerusalem's status'' by
expanding city limits far into Israeli territory to the west, and
by extending Jerusalem's ``municipal umbrella'' to Jewish towns and
settlements in disputed territories to the east.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, the eastward reach was promptly assailed by
Palestinians, Europe and the U.S. State Department, which have a
strong interest in reviving the stalled progress toward a final
peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   But a far greater outcry came from a less expected quarter: the
Israeli suburbanites to the west. Their story explains a lot about
how intricately tied up the peace process is with the internal,
often byzantine, politics of Israelis themselves.
</P>
<P>
   To them, the plan was not a thumb in Yasser Arafat's eye, but
one in their own _ a blatant bid by Mayor Ehud Olmert to solve
Jerusalem's demographic and financial problems with the flick of an
administrative pen, simply by gobbling up suburbs to which
prosperous and secular Jerusalemites have been fleeing, with their
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, Olmert effectively told the defectors, you will be in
Jerusalem, like it or not.
</P>
<P>
   And they do not. Shlomo Kanyas, a resident of a nearby hamlet
who owns a garden supply shop here and is a prime mover behind the
bitter resistance to Jerusalem's expansion plan, put it this way:
``I support Jerusalem. I believe Jerusalem is a holy place for the
Jewish people. I'd do anything to keep it like that. But that
doesn't mean I have to live in Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is simple. Even as Israel is fiercely battling for
international recognition of Jerusalem as the united and eternal
capital of the Jews, the city's Arab population is growing at a
rate four times as fast as the Jews. At the same time, secular
Israelis are steadily being squeezed out by ultra-Orthodox Jews,
who have far larger families _ and far lower incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Arabs currently account for 30 percent of the total population
of 620,000, and Israeli planners have not been reticent to declare
that this is their preferred limit. According to a recent study by
the Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies, keeping the rate at
current levels would mean that Arabs will account for 45 percent of
the population in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The study also showed that more Jewish residents were leaving
Jerusalem than were moving in, largely because of the high cost of
housing and a dearth of jobs. Another significant statistic was
that while the ultra-Orthodox accounted for only 30 percent of the
Jewish residents of Jerusalem, their children accounted for 58
percent of all children in Jewish kindergartens.
</P>
<P>
   One result is that Jerusalem is the second poorest city in
Israel after Bnei Brak, an ultra-Orthodox city adjacent to Tel
Aviv, and stands to get poorer. Another is that a majority of the
population in Jerusalem do not share the Zionist zeal to affirm it
as the capital of Israel _ the Arabs because they support the
Palestinian claim to Jerusalem, and the ultra-Orthodox because
their feelings for Jerusalem are more religious than political.
</P>
<P>
   The plan adopted by the government, which must still be worked
out by experts, seeks to resolve these various problems by
instantly boosting the Jewish population and tax base of Jerusalem,
and giving the city control over large tracts of vacant land east
and west where attractive housing can be built to lure young
couples _ and to house the rapidly swelling religious population.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, as the popular columnist Nahum Barnea wrote in the
newspaper Yediot Ahronot, is that the plan is undemocratic:
``Jerusalem, which is steadily growing more ultra-Orthodox, and has
been deserted by tens of thousands to the suburbs, now pursues
those who have left, along with their property taxes, and forcibly
brings them home.''
</P>
<P>
   Yisrael Kimche, a researcher at the Jerusalem Institute for
Israel Studies, argued further that moving the center of the city
westward would only weaken the old center, and would erode the
green areas between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond all such practical and political concerns, there is the
sad irony that people whose ancestors yearned so ardently for
Jerusalem are now so upset at living there.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her
cunning,'' mourned the psalmist from exile by the waters of
Babylon.
</P>
<P>
   The residents of Mevasseret Zion may not have the ancients' way
with words, but the placard outside the local council headquarters
had some of the same ardor: ``Annexation of Mevasseret Zion equals
political violence.'' Those residents who battled the police and
tried to block traffic on the main Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway last
week were not sparing their right hands, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lived in Jerusalem for five years,'' said Yoram Sason, head
of special events in the Mevasseret Zion council. ``I felt there
was nothing there for me, no community life, no entertainment.
People here left Jerusalem because Jerusalem was not developed, it
had no community services, the education was lacking.'' Here, he
said, the schools were better, property values were higher, taxes
were lower.
</P>
<P>
   Both Sason and Kanyas, whose home is in Beit Zayit nearby,
seemed especially put off that they were members of Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party, and had voted for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What upsets me is that I voted for Likud, and the government
was supposed to build on the eastern side of Jerusalem,'' said
Kanyas, unwittingly suggesting that his notion of ``political
violence'' did not extend to building on predominantly Arab lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I don't want to live in Jerusalem,'' he quickly
added. ``Jerusalem is very important for us. But we don't have to
live in Jerusalem to feel that Jerusalem is important for the
Jewish people. Not the whole country should live in Jerusalem.''

   MEVASSERET ZION, Israel _ Through the centuries of dispersion,
Jews affirmed the faith that they would eventually return to Zion
by declaring, ``Next year in Jerusalem!''
</P>
<P>
   But the ancient vow has taken on an unwelcome new meaning for
residents of this sylvan suburb, and others scattered through the
hills west of Jerusalem, that Israel's government wants to annex to
the Holy City.
</P>
<P>
   Having established themselves in Zion's secular prosperity, the
suburbanites here want no part of the Holy City's politics, taxes _
and, most of all, its increasing emphasis on religion.
</P>
<P>
   Their passions were fired last week by the announcement of a
government plan ``for strengthening of Jerusalem's status'' by
expanding city limits far into Israeli territory to the west, and
by extending Jerusalem's ``municipal umbrella'' to Jewish towns and
settlements in disputed territories to the east.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, the eastward reach was promptly assailed by
Palestinians, Europe and the U.S. State Department, which have a
strong interest in reviving the stalled progress toward a final
peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   But a far greater outcry came from a less expected quarter: the
Israeli suburbanites to the west. Their story explains a lot about
how intricately tied up the peace process is with the internal,
often byzantine, politics of Israelis themselves.
</P>
<P>
   To them, the plan was not a thumb in Yasser Arafat's eye, but
one in their own _ a blatant bid by Mayor Ehud Olmert to solve
Jerusalem's demographic and financial problems with the flick of an
administrative pen, simply by gobbling up suburbs to which
prosperous and secular Jerusalemites have been fleeing, with their
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, Olmert effectively told the defectors, you will be in
Jerusalem, like it or not.
</P>
<P>
   And they do not. Shlomo Kanyas, a resident of a nearby hamlet
who owns a garden supply shop here and is a prime mover behind the
bitter resistance to Jerusalem's expansion plan, put it this way:
``I support Jerusalem. I believe Jerusalem is a holy place for the
Jewish people. I'd do anything to keep it like that. But that
doesn't mean I have to live in Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is simple. Even as Israel is fiercely battling for
international recognition of Jerusalem as the united and eternal
capital of the Jews, the city's Arab population is growing at a
rate four times as fast as the Jews. At the same time, secular
Israelis are steadily being squeezed out by ultra-Orthodox Jews,
who have far larger families _ and far lower incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Arabs currently account for 30 percent of the total population
of 620,000, and Israeli planners have not been reticent to declare
that this is their preferred limit. According to a recent study by
the Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies, keeping the rate at
current levels would mean that Arabs will account for 45 percent of
the population in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The study also showed that more Jewish residents were leaving
Jerusalem than were moving in, largely because of the high cost of
housing and a dearth of jobs. Another significant statistic was
that while the ultra-Orthodox accounted for only 30 percent of the
Jewish residents of Jerusalem, their children accounted for 58
percent of all children in Jewish kindergartens.
</P>
<P>
   One result is that Jerusalem is the second poorest city in
Israel after Bnei Brak, an ultra-Orthodox city adjacent to Tel
Aviv, and stands to get poorer. Another is that a majority of the
population in Jerusalem do not share the Zionist zeal to affirm it
as the capital of Israel _ the Arabs because they support the
Palestinian claim to Jerusalem, and the ultra-Orthodox because
their feelings for Jerusalem are more religious than political.
</P>
<P>
   The plan adopted by the government, which must still be worked
out by experts, seeks to resolve these various problems by
instantly boosting the Jewish population and tax base of Jerusalem,
and giving the city control over large tracts of vacant land east
and west where attractive housing can be built to lure young
couples _ and to house the rapidly swelling religious population.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, as the popular columnist Nahum Barnea wrote in the
newspaper Yediot Ahronot, is that the plan is undemocratic:
``Jerusalem, which is steadily growing more ultra-Orthodox, and has
been deserted by tens of thousands to the suburbs, now pursues
those who have left, along with their property taxes, and forcibly
brings them home.''
</P>
<P>
   Yisrael Kimche, a researcher at the Jerusalem Institute for
Israel Studies, argued further that moving the center of the city
westward would only weaken the old center, and would erode the
green areas between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>

sad irony that people whose ancestors yearned so ardently for
Jerusalem are now so upset at living there.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her
cunning,'' mourned the psalmist from exile by the waters of
Babylon.
</P>

   The residents of Mevasseret Zion may not have the ancients' way

SPORTS COLUMN: TIME-STUDY MAN MONITORS WORLD CUP 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Mr. Blatter is happy. Production is up. Blatter consults
his clipboard and his stopwatch and his computer printouts. More
fouls. Good. More yellow cards. Good. More red cards. Very good.
</P>
<P>
   With the referees under orders to reward the skillful and punish
the wicked, the World Cup of soccer roared into its second round
Saturday. Italy eliminated Norway, 1-0, in Marseilles and Brazil
was playing Chile in Paris in the Round of 16. No more waltzes of
convenience, no more ties.
</P>
<P>
   The clumsy and the inept from soccer's third world _ the earnest
South Koreans and the striving Tunisians and the bickering Yanks _
have been sent packing. Now we were down to 16 survivors who had
learned to live within the rules, to say nothing of the
interpretations and demands of Joseph (Sepp) Blatter, the man who
blows the whistle on the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``May I call you Mr. Blatter?'' coyly asked Robin Williams
during the goofy showbiz draw for the 1994 World Cup, straight from
the ersatz heart of Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   For a few brief moments, Williams and the dignified Swiss Army
officer became a pair, Frick and Frack. But most of the time,
Blatter has serious business at hand, cleaning up soccer's act.
</P>
<P>
   Blatter is the newly elected head of the powerful world soccer
body, known as FIFA. For many years, he has dedicated himself to
making the game less crude, so lively that even the dunk junkies
and home-run addicts in the United States might get it.
</P>
<P>
   More offense. We must have more offense. To accomplish this end,
FIFA pushed through a new rule just in time for the World Cup, an
erratic move worthy of the lords of baseball, with their split
personality over the designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   With only weeks to prepare, players were warned they would be
sent off in abject shame if they did what soccer players have done
for generations _ hack somebody with the ball from behind, to keep
him from advancing. Good grief. If officials had done that, Claudio
Gentile of Italy could not have whacked Diego Armando Maradona into
a bloody stump during the 1982 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The early output did not satisfy Robin Williams' pal. After
watching a few chippy games, Blatter warned the officials to get
tougher, right in the middle of the World Cup, the equivalent of
Paul Tagliabue going into the officials' locker at halftime of the
Super Bowl and saying he was not happy with the holding being
committed by the 'roid-rage linemen.
</P>
<P>
   Blatter got the referees' attention. That very night, one
officious official started pulling yellow and red cards out of his
pocket like a street vendor handing out fliers for a new pizzeria
in Manhattan. Hey, check it out. One ref took the stunned
Cameroonians right out of a game against Italy, but whatever.
Blatter glanced at his flow charts the next morning, and he was
pleased.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the first round, the lads are scoring at a clip of
2.63 goals per game, which is slightly down from 1994 but is still
a basketball equivalent of both teams breaking 100 points. There
have been 51.3 fouls called per team, and they seem to reflect the
styles of the teams. Hipper-dipper Brazil has committed the fewest
fouls, 32, and effervescent Nigeria has committed only 33. On the
other foot, so to speak, Iran and Japan, both emerging soccer
nations, have committed the most fouls with 69 each.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously enough, Argentina, no stranger to cynical fouls and
dramatic flopping over enemy affronts, real and imagined _ plus,
the only team to give up zero goals in the first round _ has
suffered the most fouls, a whopping 74. The Yugoslavs, no slouches
themselves, have been fouled 61 times. In a tie for third were
Colombia and the United States with 60 fouls suffered apiece. I
think that means the Yanks can't even get out of the way of a nasty
boot.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have given out 16 red cards and 185 yellow cards. Are
they overreacting? Not always. There was a great deal of wailing
the other day when the American referee, Esse Baharmast, called a
foul on Brazil's Junior Baiano that set up the winning penalty kick
that allowed Norway to qualify ahead of Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   African soccer officials are still upset over that call, as well
as the calls that buried Cameroon twice, but a second-day influx of
television replays clearly show Junior Baiano clutching a Norwegian
shirt, the new fashion in fouls this World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   David Will, the FIFA head of officials, made a point of praising
Baharmast, and has assigned him as the fourth referee for a
second-round game, the elimination phase, another world, no more
``playing for a result.'' You either win the game with a goal or go
into the dreaded penalty-kick shootout.
</P>
<P>
   American sports fans can relate to the change in pace, the way
hockey suddenly gets intense during the Stanley Cup playoffs, the
way NBA teams start playing defense in April.
</P>
<P>
   In this phase of the World Cup, if desperate teams should resort
to cynical tactics, let them be warned. The rules will be enforced.
Blatter is watching. &QL;

<P>
   BEIJING _ The U.S.-China summit meeting ended Saturday night
with a formal state dinner after an extraordinary live televised
exchange between President Clinton and Jiang Zemin, the Chinese
president, over human rights, Tibet and China's path to the future.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders announced a number of agreements, including a
pledge to retarget their ballistic missiles quickly so that neither
side is aiming nuclear weapons at the other.
</P>
<P>
   The two nations also announced modest progress toward China's
adherence to an international missile proliferation agreement and
steps toward China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   But the drama of the meeting came in a remarkable 70-minute news
conference, carried live on nationwide Chinese television, in which
the two presidents differed sharply on the nature of personal
freedom, the role of the state and the meaning of the Tiananmen
Square demonstrations that were violently suppressed by the Chinese
government in June 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Some U.S. officials expressed concern after Saturday's exchange
that the Chinese might not permit the broadcast of Clinton's speech
on Monday to students at Beijing University, the rhetorical
centerpiece of the president's nine-day visit to China. But they
said the president had made his point in unvarnished terms before a
potentially huge audience.
</P>
<P>
   However, because few Chinese knew that the news conference would
be televised live, it was not clear how many had actually seen it,
and there was no mention of the debate in later television or print
coverage of the trip in China.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting represented a significant evolution in the often
tense relationship between the two powers and was the first time a
foreign leader had squarely confronted the painful legacy of
Tiananmen Square on Chinese soil _ and on Chinese airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials were jubilant because the news conference allowed
Clinton to speak without filters to the Chinese people of American
concerns about China's human-rights record.
</P>
<P>
   It was also, in their view, a powerful response to critics in
the United States who said that Clinton should not have rewarded
the Chinese government with a high-profile summit meeting even as
its communist leaders continued to suppress political speech and
the free exercise of religion.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said that they did not signal to the Chinese in
advance of the news conference that Clinton planned to speak out
forcefully on the Tiananmen Square tragedy. They said they did not
want to force Jiang into a defensive posture, or, more important,
cause the Chinese to pull the plug on the live broadcast of the
event.
</P>
<P>
   The spirited exchange recalled earlier confrontations between
top U.S. officials and communist leaders, including the ``kitchen
debate'' between Richard Nixon, then vice president, and Nikita
Khrushchev, and the summit meeting between Ronald Reagan and
Mikhail Gorbachev. It also echoed a similar debate on human rights
when Jiang was in Washington last October. But at Saturday's news
conference, the back and forth was more forceful and animated.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton flatly told the Chinese leader that his government had
been ``wrong'' to use force to end the peaceful demonstrations of
the spring of 1989 and that broad personal freedom and political
expression were the price of admission to the world community of
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all of our agreements, we still disagree about the meaning
of what happened then,'' Clinton said in his opening statement,
referring to the violent crackdown on Tiananmen Square the night of
June 3-4, 1989, that left hundreds of protesters dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe, and the American people believe, that the use of
force and the tragic loss of life was wrong,'' the president said
as a stone-faced Jiang looked on. ``I believe, and the American
people believe, that freedom of speech, association and religion
are, as recognized by the U.N. Charter, the right of people
everywhere and should be protected by their governments.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked by a reporter about Clinton's remarks on the lessons
of Tiananmen Square, Jiang appeared ready with an answer. He
defended the use of army tanks and rifles to end what he called the
``disturbances'' of 1989 as essential to maintaining order.
</P>
<P>
   He said the United States and China had different social
systems, ideologies, histories and cultures. ``So it's nothing
strange that we may have some difference of views over some
issues,'' Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With regard to the political disturbances in 1989, the Chinese
people have long drawn a historical conclusion,'' he went on,
becoming more emphatic in his expression and his gestures. ``I have
stated our position that with regard to the political disturbances
in 1989, had the Chinese government not taken the resolute
measures, then we could not have enjoyed the stability that we are
enjoying today.''
</P>
<P>
   He then offered Clinton an opportunity to reply, in what U.S.
officials called a generous political gesture that Clinton eagerly
seized.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that the U.S. system was based on a delicate
balance between personal liberty and central authority, with
liberty the paramount value.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the question for all societies going forward into the 21st
century is: Which is the better gamble?'' Clinton said. ``If you
have a lot of personal freedom, some people may abuse it. But if
you are so afraid of personal freedom because of the abuse, that
you limit people's freedom too much, then you pay, I believe, an
even greater price.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tibet, Clinton urged Jiang to initiate a direct dialogue with
the Dalai Lama, the mountain region's religious leader, in return
for recognition that Tibet is part of China. He also urged Jiang to
respect the ``unique cultural and religious heritage'' of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang replied that, as a communist and an atheist, he found it
``unfortunate'' that Tibet clung to what he called an anachronistic
theocracy.
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that religious freedom was protected in Tibet, as
elsewhere in China, and said that Beijing had invested millions of
dollars in the economic development of Tibet and restoration of
historic shrines.
</P>
<P>
   But he expressed bewilderment that many educated Americans and
Europeans believed in lamaism and blindly supported the Dalai
Lama's calls for greater autonomy.

 BEIJING: greater autonomy.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clinton, permitted the last word at the end of the lengthy news
conference, said: ``Let me say something that will perhaps be
unpopular with everyone. I have spent time with the Dalai Lama. I
believe him to be an honest man, and I believe if he had a
conversation with Jiang, they would like each other very much.''
The audience, both Chinese and American, laughed.
</P>
<P>
   At the state dinner in the Great Hall of the People, the leaders
wore business suits and Hillary Rodham Clinton wore a bright yellow
pantsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In toasting Clinton, Jiang noted that the relationship between
China and the United States had seen ``some twists and turns'' but
was nevertheless moving forward. He acknowledged differences on
some fundamental issues, but added, ``What is important is that the
common interests between the two sides far outweigh their
differences.''
</P>
<P>
   In his toast, Clinton said, ``We Americans appreciate the mutual
respect of our relationship _ a relationship based on cooperation,
candor and recognition of each other's values and traditions.'' He
concluded his toast with the traditional Chinese ``Gan bei!'' or
``Bottoms up!''
</P>
<P>
   The agreements announced Saturday offered no breakthroughs in
U.S.-China relations. Rather, they were incremental steps across a
broad range of issues that U.S. officials said demonstrated the
depth of a growing relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The two nations will work more closely on fighting disease and
environmental health problems, on combating drugs and on clean
energy programs. They will cooperate on legal reforms, including
training of judges and lawyers and the use of the legal system to
ensure the observance of human rights.
</P>
<P>
   They agreed to work together to reduce and eventually eliminate
the global use of anti-personnel land mines. And they pledged to
jointly press India and Pakistan to walk back from the nuclear
brink by halting all nuclear tests and joining the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this has been quite an extraordinary day in the
evolution of U.S.-China relations,'' said Sandy Berger, the White
House national security adviser. ``This is a summit that produced
substantial results that will make life more secure and improve
lives in other ways for the American people and for the Chinese
people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We also saw today a truly historic press conference that for
the first time witnessed the leader of the United States and the
leader of China discussing and debating a range of issues, but most
particularly human rights, to a live audience across China and the
United States,'' Berger said. ``A president of the United States
and a president of China not only speaking to themselves, not only
speaking to the press, but speaking to their own people and
speaking to each other's people.''

WORST LOSS FOR THE METS: LEITER IS OUT 4-6 WEEKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The loss of their No. 1 pitcher was not what the Mets
wanted to take away from their scintillating series with the
Yankees, but that development is expected to overshadow anything
else that happens for the Mets at Shea Stadium this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Al Leiter, one of the National League's best starters this
season, went on the disabled list Saturday, lost for what the Mets
said would be four to six weeks with a 50 percent tear of the
patella tendon in his left knee. Leiter's loss is a crippling blow
to the Mets' chances of snatching a spot in the post-season
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter, who had possessed the league's lowest earned run average
before he pitched against the Yankees Friday night, was injured in
the seventh inning of the game while trying to tag Derek Jeter in a
play at first base. He was optimistic about an early return but
despondent over the injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I'm disappointed,'' Leiter said from his Manhattan
apartment in a conference call with reporters. ``To go from having
a career year, putting up great numbers, all sorts of wonderful
things going on, to how many starts am I going to have. It's
upsetting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are faced with replacing the left-handed Leiter, who
lost an almost certain spot on the National League All-Star team,
with someone from their existing staff or organization, most likely
Brian Bohanon, or securing a pitcher in a trade.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Harnisch of Cincinnati may be the most available starter,
but a member of the Mets' staff said the club would not pursue him.
Harnisch began last season with the Mets but went on the disabled
list suffering from depression, and his relationship with Manager
Bobby Valentine deteriorated badly.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager, was noncommittal on
his plans. Asked how confident the Mets were that Leiter would be
back in four to six weeks, he said that prognosis ``is the hope''
but added, ``I don't know when he's going to be back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Internally,'' he said, ``we look at four to six weeks and
evaluate from there how we think we fit, who's available on the
outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips acknowledged that the Mets' position in the pursuit of
a playoff spot ``makes our motivation more serious or urgent to get
a quick solution to the problem, a quick evaluation how we're going
to go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' brain trust plans to spend the next day or two
scouring the market to see which starters might be available. Until
now, they had focused on searching for middle relief pitchers. What
they most likely will find when they seek a starter is that about
half of the teams in the major leagues are looking for the same
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Bohanon, like Leiter a left-hander, has made three starts this
season, two in second games of doubleheaders. Last year he started
14 times, all but one after he was recalled from Norfolk on July
22.
</P>
<P>
   Other possible fill-in starters are Bill Pulsipher, who joined
the Mets from Norfolk last Sunday, and Mark Mimbs, who has won 10
games with Norfolk. There is also Armando Reynoso, who is scheduled
to pitch five innings tomorrow in his comeback from shoulder
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have a pretty good track record as a spot starter,''
Bohanon said. ``In my starts last season I threw the ball pretty
well.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bohanon was quick to note the significance of Leiter's loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could count on Al going seven, eight, nine innings,''
Bohanon said. ``He made his presence on the mound felt. Hitters
don't like facing him. He has that nasty cutter. He developed a
sinker. He was having a fabulous year.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiter has a 9-4 record and a 1.86 ERA, which was second in the
league to Greg Maddux's 1.75 before Saturday night. After Leiter
felt something happen to his left knee on the play Friday night, he
threw one practice pitch, then left the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I threw that one pitch, I knew it was really sore,''
Leiter said. ``But I've been through an awful lot. And a knee is
not as detrimental to a pitcher as for a guy who runs and steals
bases.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Leiter pitched much of last season with an ailing right knee
_ he had surgery after the season _ and it affected his pitching.
He went from a 16-12 record and 2.93 ERA in 1996 to 11-9 and 4.34.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter's newly injured left knee will be immobilized, and he
will undergo therapy for it. ``It's not like there's any pain,'' he
said. ``It's more like a real bad, bad case of jumper's knee. But
it's not a weight-bearing injury. I can still walk. It's when I
flex it or bend it that it's sore. It's more sore than anything
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiter said he would miss not being able to go to the All-Star
game. ``I really thoroughly enjoyed my first All-Star game,'' he
said, referring to the 1996 contest. ``It's a downer. It's a
bummer. It's not good.''

SPORTS COLUMN: NYC CHAMPIONS PROVIDE HOPE FOR U.S. SOCCER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The best high school soccer player in the city, the
sweet, serious Mansour Ndiaye, does not know how many goals he
scored during the last two unbeaten seasons at Martin Luther King
Jr. Nor did he know, until he was introduced at graduation last
Thursday as salutatorian, the precise numbers of his academic
average: 94.5.
</P>
<P>
   But in a thick accent for which he apologized _ without
mentioning that he began speaking English, his fourth language,
only since coming from Senegal two years ago _ the chunky
18-year-old midfielder thanked his coach, Martin Jacobson, and
offered advice to his classmates as precise as his shots on goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember,'' he said, ``you just can't do it by your own.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a fitting ending to a brilliant scholastic career that
also offers a snapshot of inner-city soccer, a world of poor young
immigrants who sneaker companies, amateur federations and
professional teams are just beginning to realize may be America's
only hope of avoiding another century of World Cup wipeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``My kids come to this country at 14, 15, 16 years old, with
games,'' said Jacobson, whose kids won 38 consecutive matches on
the way to two consecutive Public School Athletic League
championships. ``Some of them played on their national high school
teams. America's not going to win anything with upper-middle-class
white suburban kids who play rigid textbook patterns.''
</P>
<P>
   That was underscored last weekend when the United States team
lost to Iran and the core of the King team, playing as a club
called the F.C. Harlem Jakes, easily won the under-19 division of
the 3,000-player, 90-team Nordic Spirit tournament in Middlebury,
Vt.
</P>
<P>
   One of the four games the King boys won was against a team of
Division I collegians from New Hampshire and Massachusetts who grew
increasingly frustrated and physical against the quicksilver
freelancing of the African and West Indian teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   For the Jakes, who live mostly in Brooklyn and upper Manhattan
and attend a high school without a lawn, the culture shock included
the bucolic Middlebury College campus with its 12 lush soccer
fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very hard not to just stand there and appreciate all
that beauty,'' said Mansour, who is widely known by his first name.
``I was thinking I would be happy to just sleep on this grass.''
</P>
<P>
   Mansour has been too much of a model citizen and too well
rewarded for his hard work to be offered up as a standard. He is
also luckier than most young immigrants. Between the city's
Senegalese community and its vast ethnic soccer infrastructure, he
has had help finding flexible hours in fast-food jobs and good
weekend and summer-league teams to play on. The uncle he lives with
in Harlem encourages his devotion to schoolwork. Mansour will
attend the University of Connecticut on a full scholarship next
fall.
</P>
<P>
   When Mansour first came from Dakar in 1996, he spoke the dialect
Wolof, French and German. He was steered to King, the largest high
school in Manhattan with 3,200 students. Jacobson uses the school's
excellent English as a Second Language program as a recruiting tool
for talented players.
</P>
<P>
   In Mansour's first year, the team star was Barry Swift from
Trinidad, who is now in a Major League Soccer development program
and is soon expected to be playing for the MetroStars. Mansour was
a wingback that first year, racing downfield from his defensive
position to score.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson thinks that over the two years Mansour has scored at
least 40 goals and made 40 assists, but it has been his policy to
never keep such records because he thinks they are divisive. He
believes that the unselfish love of teammates creates the spirit of
true victory. In Mansour, who switched to midfield this past
season, he may have found one of his most apt disciples, even
though Jacobson is a New Ager who rubs crystals and Mansour is a
Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   ``There cannot be animosity or jealousy,'' Mansour said at lunch
last week, two days before graduation.
</P>
<P>
   He speaks slowly and carefully, as if crafting a pronouncement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a guy who doesn't pass, I give him a good pass to help
him score,'' he said. ``He will realize his errors. You see,
players are not selfish by nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the table, the 52-year-old Jacobson beamed and said:
``Mansour is very sensitive. He is a Pisces.''
</P>
<P>
   Mansour laughed and rolled his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``So,'' asked Jacobson, a muscular coiled spring, ``have you
written your speech yet?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ahhh, Jake,'' said Mansour, smiling, ``I am working on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Jacobson, dapper in a jacket and Bugs Bunny tie,
sat on the edge of his chair in the Cathedral of John the Divine as
Mansour thanked everyone who had ``helped a little boy bridge the
gap of language'' and urged his classmates to do their best to
``overcome the handicaps on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   He was not only speaking rhetorically. The students' caps and
gowns did not arrive on time for the ceremony, and the
disappointment was palpable at first in a crowd of families dressed
for an important occasion; many were attending their first
graduation in America. But the spirit prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   Mansour had been preceded by the Rev. Alfonso Wyatt, vice
president of the Fund for the City of New York. In his rousing
keynote address, Wyatt implied that the lack of caps and gowns were
a gift from God, giving the students a chance to see themselves
without unnecessary adornment, as they really were, proud
achievers.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of the ceremony, Mansour received seven awards,
for leadership and for academic and athletic excellence, including
the plaques for his Parade Magazine all-America team award and for
the Iron Horse, given by the city for the top player in each sport.
</P>
<P>
   In an emotional speech, the principal, Stephanie D'Amore, also
gave him a check for $1,000, the Caring and Compassion Scholarship.
She told the audience how Mansour had worked so hard and sent most
of his wages home to Senegal. That brought a long, appreciative
sigh from the families in the cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   Mansour tends to make people feel good. Last weekend, he was the
moral star of the Vermont trip, which was put on by Samuel Ravit, a
South Burlington insurance executive and president of the Nordic
Spirit soccer club. Touched by newspaper accounts of the Martin
Luther King Jr. team, he invited the players to the tournament, and
arranged for the IDX Foundation and Paine Webber to defray costs,
including rental for a bus sent down to pick them up on Friday
night and bring them home Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Team members stayed with local families, who were amazed at the
teen-agers' easy courtesy. The players were amazed at the casual
piles of fruits and cereals on the breakfast tables. There were
edgier culture shocks. Many of the tournament teams, who came from
all over the Northeast, were spectacularly well-equipped with
matching gym bags, trainers, soccer moms and even pumps to spray
mist on hot foreheads.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the F.C. Harlem Jakes were wearing two-tone whitish
jerseys that Jacobson had bought from a Manhattan soccer supplier,
Doss, for $8.95 each. The jerseys were rejects because the color on
the sleeves did not match the color on the rest of the shirt. When
another coach complained that the Jakes did not have the
tournament's requisite home and away jerseys, Ravit quickly came up
with 11 of the red mesh practice vests called ``pinnies'' and
decreed them proper uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a learning experience,'' his wife, Gail, said dryly.
``Not all the coaches understand that everyone doesn't live in
Shelburne, Vt., and have six of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Such discussions tended to slide over the heads of the Jakes.
Among the issues under discussion that weekend were Mansour's
continuing problems with the Immigration and Naturalization Service
_ documents from Senegal were under review _ and the need to find
work and rooms for three homeless players on the team. Mansour is
the only member of the team accepted to a four-year school.
</P>
<P>
   In such a climate of bucolic affluence and impending reality,
Jacobson managed to get his first yellow card, a technical foul for
calling a referee a ``fool.''
</P>
<P>
   Mansour was not amused, shaking his head at his coach between
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mad at me?'' Jacobson asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get so hyped up, Jake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I apologized. I learned from you, Mansour, I did the
diplomatic thing.''
</P>
<P>
   They hugged.
</P>
<P>
   Life without Mansour may be a tad harder for Jacobson _ who else
can translate pep talks into French and rouse a lagging team by
example? _ but the current upsurge of interest in inner-city soccer
may counteract the loss. Nike recently became an MLK Jr. outfitter,
donating uniforms and shoes, and the company asked Jacobson to
consult on its plans to sponsor soccer events in urban
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   That, along with a declaration by Alan Rothenberg, the head of
the U.S. Soccer Federation, that money would be going to inner-city
clubs, has led some to believe that soccer may have learned a
lesson from basketball: new energy for the American game will come
from the city.
</P>
<P>
   Along with that energy will also come the problems that Jacobson
deals with every season _ poor kids without green cards struggling
to stay eligible in overwhelmed public schools.
</P>
<P>
   With all that in mind last Nov. 22, on a Saturday night several
hours after his team had won its second straight city championship,
Jacobson sat at his wooden desk in school, his shaved head in his
hands.
</P>
<P>
   The Trinidadians were leading the dancing in the halls, the
pizza and soda were on order, but the 52-year-old coach was already
thinking about next year's team. Without the senior captains, Kevon
Isa, Randy Guerra and Mansour, there would be no heart and soul to
the team, he thought.
</P>
<P>
   At Thanksgiving a few days later, Mansour tried to cheer him up.
The world was filled with soccer players, he said. They'll come.
You'll see.
</P>
<P>
   And of course they did. By January, two 17-year-old Nigerians,
Bishop Dike and Henry Iwuchukwu, appeared, steered by the youth
soccer coaches in Brooklyn. They are recent immigrants,
quick-footed, eager, confident.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson supervised their enrollment and made sure they did well
enough His elation was borne out last weekend, when they starred in
the Vermont romp, on and off the field. Bishop made such a big
impression that his host family sent him home with a computer.
</P>
<P>
   At that pregraduation lunch last week, as Jacobson raved on
about Bishop and Henry, someone turned to Mansour and said: ``How
do you feel? Next year people will say, `Mansour who?'''
</P>
<P>
   He was chewing a chicken sandwich and, typically, he seemed to
chew the question for a while before he said: ``It would be too bad
if they forgot me. They should remember what I did so that they can
be better than I was.'' &QL;

<P>
   Timeline of the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse:
</P>
<P>
   1797: Congress approves construction of a lighthouse at the
Diamond Shoals of Cape Hatteras. It's built a mile inland in 1803,
but at 90 feet is woefully short.
</P>
<P>
   1870: Cape Hatteras Lighthouse built 1,600 feet from sea. At 208
feet, tallest in nation.
</P>
<P>
   1920s: Sea encroaches to within 300 feet of lighthouse.
</P>
<P>
   1930s: Civilian Conservation Corps builds up dune line with sand
and dune grass. Still ocean advances to 100 feet of structure.
Coast Guard abandons lighthouse; transfers ownership to National
Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   1950: Coast Guard reactivates lighthouse when erosion appears
stabilized.
</P>
<P>
   1970: The Navy builds three concrete and steel sheet pile groins
in front of the naval installation, north of lighthouse, to protect
naval facility. Third groin reaches the lighthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Early 1980s: Army Corps of Engineers studies alternatives in
wake of beach erosion, including adding fourth groin and relocation
of lighthouse. The third groin is extended, and sandbags and sand
fences are erected. Corps proposes building a seawall.
</P>
<P>
   1987: ``Move the Lighthouse Committee'' presents documents on
relocation techniques. The National Park Service contracts with the
National Academy of Sciences for an independent review of all
protection plans. The academy recommends moving the structure.
</P>
<P>
   1989: Park service decides to move the lighthouse, asks Congress
for funds.
</P>
<P>
   1993: Relocation put on hold so money can be used for emergency
measures. Hurricane Emily damages lighthouse.
</P>
<P>
   1994: Hurricane Gordon damages dunes and sandbag revetment.
South groin repaired.
</P>
<P>
   1996: Sandbags added to north and south sides of lighthouse.
Plans go forward for a move.
</P>
<P>
   1997: Park Service asks Congress for $2 million to prepare to
move the lighthouse and $9.8 million for the move. President
Clinton includes it in his budget recommendations.

 &HT;    SOS for Cape Hatteras Lighthouse
 &HT;    By Gerrie Ferris Finger
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE HATTERAS, N.C. _ The controversy swirling around the
nation's tallest sentinel of the shore is like the seas beneath it
in a nor'easter, and a U.S. Senate committee's decision last week
to appropriate $9.8 million to move the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse
appears unlikely to stand without a fight.
</P>
<P>
   The combatants all agree that something must be done to save the
128-year-old lighthouse from collapsing on the beach where waves
lap precariously close to its brick and mortar base. The
disagreement is over the method of salvation.
</P>
<P>
   One side says the historic spiral-striped beacon should be moved
back from the advancing ocean. The other side says leave it where
it is and beat back the seas.
</P>
<P>
   The National Park Service, which owns the lighthouse, wants to
move it. It recently awarded a $1.4 million contract to
International Chimney Co. of Buffalo, N.Y., to prepare plans for a
move.
</P>
<P>
   ``The locals are going to try to stop the Park Service from
moving it,'' says Irene Nolan, a columnist for the Island Breeze,
who says residents are 10-1 against the move. Even North Carolina's
congressional delegation is divided on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Lauch Faircloth has pushed for funding for the move in the
Senate. Rep. Walter Jones has opposed it in the House and proposed
instead appropriating $4 million to build an 800-foot-long steel
wall south of the lighthouse and pump a half million cubic yards of
sand behind it. A House subcommittee rejected that plan a week ago
but has not voted on funding a move.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Gov. Jim Hunt in March, the U.S. Lighthouse
Society expressed support for relocating the lighthouse. ``It is
time to take action,'' wrote Wayne Wheeler, president of the
society, ``and we believe the proper and only effective course of
action is to move this structure from harm's way.''
</P>
<P>
   But local officials oppose relocation. Dare County
commissioners, who rarely vote unanimously on anything, voted
unanimously in November to support building a groin, or jetty, out
from the beach south of the lighthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Relocation foes, led by businessman and environmentalist Hugh
Morton,have reinvigorated an old campaign to keep the structure
where it is and shore up the beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to do everything we can to see it protected where
it is,'' Morton says.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, the Navy built three groins to protect an installation
that monitored the coast for Soviet submarines, and for 10 years
the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse benefited from them. But the groins
caused a bay to form south of the lighthouse, flattening dunes as
the sea advanced.
</P>
<P>
   To shore up the doomed structure in 1982, Morton's committee
raised a half million dollars and spent $165,000 on Seascape, a
synthetic seaweed designed to trap the sand running toward the
beach and to cause dune buildup. ``It wouldn't be standing today if
we hadn't raised that money,'' Morton says.
</P>
<P>
   But not everybody agrees with him, and the arguments range from
the wildly emotional to the highly technical.
</P>
<P>
   Moving the lighthouse means lifting it with hydraulic jacks,
setting it on rails and moving it inland, inch by inch, for 1,600
feet _ about where it was in relationship to the sea when it was
built in 1870. Also moved would be two keepers' quarters, which
have been converted to a gift shop, small museum and historical
center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extremely risky maneuver to move it,'' says Morton,
who advocates building a fourth groin south of the lighthouse and
installing erosion stabilizers. ``We've got a lighthouse built in
1870 with a million-and-a-quarter bricks in it. There already are
cracks in the mortar joints. It's 208 feet tall. They propose to
move the equivalent of a 21-story, old building more than half a
mile. There's just no need to take that kind of gamble and risk
losing it.''
</P>
<P>
   A fourth groin would cost $1.7 million to build, and Morton has
pledged his $300,000 in reserves from the 1982 campaign to install
new artificial seaweed to trap sand and create dunes.
</P>
<P>
   But a less expensive solution is not necessarily the better
answer, counters Cheryl Roberts, president of the Outer Banks
Lighthouse Society, a proponent of the move. ``So much history has
been lost in the name of economy,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   And lighthouses have been successfully moved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Structural engineers say there's no problem,'' says Bob Woody
of the National Park Service at the Cape Hatteras National
Seashore. ``It's been done many times, and this lighthouse doesn't
present any unique or unusual problem for them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Danny Couch, a local businessman who backs Morton, likens
the moving of lighthouses to ``Wal-Marting history.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, they successfully moved the Block Island Light and the
Truro Light,'' Couch says. ``They're cute and they make nice little
postcards, but they're not of the historical significance of this
one. To move it is disrespecting the maritime tradition that this
whole region is about.''
</P>
<P>
   With a somewhat similar view in mind, the Park Service
originally endorsed a project to save the landmark where it stands.
In the mid-1980s, the Army Corps of Engineers developed plans for
construction of a massive stone wall around the lighthouse. But
that would have left the lighthouse on a tiny island with the sea
eventually surrounding it.
</P>
<P>
   A group that didn't like the sea wall idea formed the Move the
Lighthouse Committee. It was made up mostly of engineers and
scientists, and its stance was a factor in the Park Service turning
to the National Academy of Sciences for further guidance in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were prepared, based on the best information available, to
build a sea wall around it,'' Woody recalls. ``But at that time we
asked one more organization to take a look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Academy of Sciences concluded that the Atlantic
Ocean could not be kept from destroying the Cape Hatteras
Lighthouse unless the structure was moved. The Park Service
abandoned plans to build a sea wall.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, state Sen. Marc Basnight asked a panel at North
Carolina State University to review the academy's findings and
scientists there concluded the report was correct.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists do not dispute that a jetty and artificial reefs
could temporarily alleviate the erosion, but nothing can hold back
rising sea levels or nor'easters and hurricanes that pound the
cape. Woody said the Park Service is pursuing a solution that would
last at least a century.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rancor, lighthouse lovers on both sides agree that
the structure is a national treasure _ the most recognized,
photographed and admired lighthouse in North America. It is the
signpost of the Graveyard of the Atlantic casting shadows on the
final resting places of those who died in these moody waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would these ghosts of those old lifesavers do if they
came up on shore?'' Couch says. ``They'd look around and say,
`Where's it at?'''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The summer of 1998 is shaping up as the worst season of the
decade for ozone pollution in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Florida: Sea breezes usually keep smog off Florida, but it had a
full week of unhealthy ozone levels in May. Forest fire smoke
continues to contribute to the bad air.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia: Atlanta, with its car-jammed suburbs and interstate
highways, remains the South's major ozone trouble spot. Ozone
alerts have been common this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee: A string of ozone days in the Great Smoky Mountains
National Park was blamed on smog drifting over from Tennessee
cities.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina: In Greenville, the ozone standard for healthy
air has been exceeded by seven days.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina: Charlotte has reported 10 bad ozone days, and
Fayetteville and Raleigh have reported eight each.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama: Birmingham issued its first ozone alert in mid-May,
unusually early for the area. Without significant public transit or
auto inspection laws, that city is being closely monitored by the
EPA for dangerous ozone levels.

smog, these Southern states are expected to have to institute more
emission controls on coal power plants within five years:

 &HT;    Air pollution blowing into problem for all of South
 &HT;    By John Harmon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Triggered by the stifling heat and stagnant weather,
bad air is hanging like a veil over much of the South this summer,
from cities to wilderness areas.
</P>
<P>
   For ozone, the key ingredient in smog, the summer of 1998 is on
track to be the worst of the decade. States throughout the region
report concentrations of ground-level ozone considered unhealthy in
a number of metro areas in May and June, with Atlanta's air rated
the worst.
</P>
<P>
   A rising tide of ozone is also choking remote areas such as
Alabama's Sipsey Wilderness and Tennessee's Great Smoky Mountains
National Park, as pollutants drift from urban to rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that Atlanta's ozone has an impact on the
region, but there is no doubt that the region has an impact on
Atlanta,'' said Mike Rodgers, an atmospheric scientist and director
of Georgia Tech's Air Quality Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a complicated mix of factors, but we now know that
(nitrogen oxide) is a key to the regional ozone problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to curb regional ozone, the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency proposes a crackdown on nitrogen oxide emissions, primarily
from coal-fired power plants, in 22 Eastern states, including
Georgia, and the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   As proposed, the states that are considered the prime
contributors of nitrogen oxides _ or ``nox'' _ will have until 2002
to reduce emissions by as much as 70 percent of 1990 levels. The
new rules are expected to be published in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that for most of our region, the nox reductions will
be enough to bring most areas into compliance on ozone standards,''
said Kay Prince, an EPA regional air quality specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Principally emitted by power plants and motor vehicles, nox is a
primary component of ozone. The nitrogen oxide also contributes to
acid rain and the whitish haze that often hangs over the region
during the hot season.
</P>
<P>
   A toxic gas, ground level ozone is harmful to children who play
outdoors, as well as people who have asthma or other respiratory
illnesses. Ozone also damages forests and crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nox emissions have grown, especially in areas of economic
growth,'' said Doug Grano, an EPA scientist who focuses on regional
ozone.
</P>
<P>
   While some 25 years of regulations under the Clean Air Act have
resulted in reductions in most air pollutants, such as lead, sulfur
dioxide and carbon monoxide, regulators have begun only in recent
years to target nox. That's because it was not until the 1990s that
scientists began to understand the role of nox in creating ozone.
</P>
<P>
   There is widespread agreement that cuts in nox will improve the
air throughout the eastern United States, but not everyone agrees
that the EPA plan will solve the ozone problem.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators from 10 states, as well as utility officials,
question the regional approach, saying the evidence is far from
conclusive that ozone is transported over long distances.
</P>
<P>
   They argue that nitrogen oxide reductions should be targeted at
areas of high ozone, but not blanket across the region.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, critics contend, the expense of retrofitting power
plants with additional pollution controls likely will result in
higher power rates that could dampen economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``EPA's approach appears to be a shotgun approach,'' said Barry
Stephens, deputy director of the Tennessee Division of Air
Pollution Control. ``I think we'll spend a lot of money and it
still might not work.''
</P>
<P>
   Governors of six of the 10 states _ including Tennessee, Alabama
and Virginia in the South _ have asked EPA to soften the rule. In a
break from its neighbors, the Georgia Environmental Protection
Division agrees the power plant reductions are needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you shut down every power plant in Georgia, our
research shows that you'd still have an ozone problem in Atlanta,''
said Chuck Griffin, a spokesman for the Southern Co., which owns
four electric utilities in four states and is the leading coal
burner in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Even Georgia Tech's Rodgers, a proponent of tougher standards
and of the theory that ozone transport is part of the problem, said
targeting only power plants ``just puts off the day when we tackle
the car problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the controversy is the confusion over EPA standard for
unhealthy ozone. Beginning last year, a new, more stringent
standard, based on ozone measures over eight hours, was enacted,
replacing a standard that was based on calculations of a one-hour
measure of ozone levels.
</P>
<P>
   But while North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida have issued
numerous ozone alerts this season based on the new standard,
Georgia and Alabama have continued to use the old standard for
informing residents of potentially unhealthy ozone.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that Charlotte and Raleigh, and Greenville, S.C.,
have had about as many ozone action days as Atlanta and Birmingham,
despite the fact that Atlanta and Birmingham historically have far
worse air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've decided to bite the bullet and start this program under
the new standard,'' said Tom Mather, a spokesman for the North
Carolina Division of Air Quality. ``This is a public health
concern. And we think it's important to get the word out to the
public.''

CHROME SPIRE BY CHRYSLER TO MEET CRYSTAL BY JOHNSON 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID W. DUNLAP   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two of the United States' most durable 20th-century
architectural icons are meeting on East 42nd Street, where Philip
Johnson has designed a modern companion piece to the Chrysler
Building, that giddy but well-loved emblem of Jazz Age abandon and
automotive supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's plans are part of a $100 million renovation of the
entire block between Lexington and Third Avenues owned by Tishman
Speyer Properties and the Travelers Group. The project, to begin
this week, includes the landmark 76-story Chrysler Building, a
32-story annex to the east and a large parcel between them.
</P>
<P>
   The annex, a bland white-brick box, will be enlarged and reclad
with a glass facade designed by Johnson. Five small buildings in
the middle of the block would be replaced by a one-story structure
topped with what Johnson calls an ``explosion of crystals'' _ a
series of glass pyramids 50 feet high.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be as dramatic as the top of the building,'' Johnson
said, referring to the chromium-plated spire with its radiant array
of chevron-shaped windows, almost like the spokes of a car wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Architectural features of the Chrysler Building would also be
restored as part of the project. The 1.9 million-square-foot
complex will be known as the Chrysler Center upon completion late
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you bring it all under one roof, figuratively speaking,
you create not only an interesting place but an anchor for 42nd
Street,'' said Jerry Speyer, the president and chief executive of
Tishman Speyer, who has also proposed a controversial renovation of
Rockefeller Center and is bidding to redevelop the site of the New
York Coliseum on Columbus Circle.
</P>
<P>
   The likeliest user of the space under Johnson's ``crystals''
would be a restaurant, Speyer said. Upstairs, only office tenants
need apply: The owners did not consider setting aside part of the
tower as a hotel, a prospect floated last summer before Tishman
Speyer took control.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Speyer said, the building is intended for
``cutting-edge companies of the new millennium,'' in the spirit of
its developer, the automaker Walter Chrysler, who dedicated the
tower in May 1930 as ``a sound contribution to business progress.''
</P>
<P>
   One of countless New Yorkers who have fallen under the Chrysler
Building's spell, Speyer can recall being taken by his father in
the late 1940s to the old Cloud Club on the 67th floor. He was a
boy, and Chrysler was still the second-tallest building in the
world. (It is now the 18th.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so infatuated looking out the windows, because it was an
awesome view,'' Speyer said. ``I remember saying, `I never want to
leave here.'''
</P>
<P>
   Today, he said, he feels like ``the custodian for something
special.'' Tishman Speyer and the Travelers insurance company
bought the buildings last year for about $220 million. They have a
150-year lease from the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science
and Art, which owns the land under the Chrysler Building.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although it is an aesthetic trophy, the Chrysler Building has
had a checkered economic history, having changed hands six times
since the Chrysler family sold it in 1953. By the end of next year,
the tower and annex will be about 55 percent vacant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been easy to put on a couple of coats of paint
and re-lease it,'' Speyer said. ``But our purpose was to recreate
the monumentality of what we've bought. We want to make it better
without interfering with the greatness of what's there already.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, no significant alterations are planned to the
original building, which was designed by William Van Alen and was
briefly the tallest tower in the world, at 1,046 feet 4} inches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in pretty good shape _ it just needs some creative
housekeeping,'' said John Belle, a partner in Beyer Blinder Belle,
the architectural firm responsible for restoring the building, as
well as renovating Grand Central Terminal and Rockefeller Center.
</P>
<P>
   The work at Chrysler will include the repair and relighting of
Edward Trumbull's ceiling mural in the lobby, the cleaning of the
surrounding walls (made of a richly veined marble called Moroccan
rouge flame) and the preparation of a master redesign plan for the
storefronts.
</P>
<P>
   The restoration proposal and storefront plan are subject to
approval by the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission, as is the
connection between the tower and the new structure designed by
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   But the annex on Third Avenue is not a landmark. Constructed in
1952 as the Chrysler Building East, and known recently as the Kent
Building, it is thoroughly undistinguished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only isn't it terribly attractive,'' Speyer said, ``but it
isn't as efficient as it could be.'' The floors of the annex are to
be expanded slightly to the west, thereby placing the elevator core
in the middle of the building rather than against the back wall,
where it is now.
</P>
<P>
   The extension, totaling about 130,000 square feet, will be clad
in glass from floor to ceiling, Johnson said, while the rest of the
building will have smaller windows with glass panels between them,
in a darker color.
</P>
<P>
   Still the enfant terrible of American architecture today at the
age of 92, Johnson set New York abuzz in the late 1970s when he
crowned the AT&AMP;T headquarters on Madison Avenue at 55th Street with
an enormous broken pediment. That building, now known as Sony
Plaza, was instantly likened to a skyscraping Chippendale highboy.
</P>
<P>
   For the Chrysler annex, Johnson made no attempt to echo the
automotive motifs in the landmark, like radiator-cap gargoyles and
hubcap-lined cornices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even like the architecture of it,'' he confessed,
``but it's become sacred now. It's the most loved building in New
York.''

AMONG SENIORS, CRAMPTON KNOWS HE IS UP THERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLIFTON, N.J. _ He knows he is fighting time and history, but
Bruce Crampton is playing through.
</P>
<P>
   At age 62, Crampton was one stroke behind the leader, Charles
Coody, entering the Cadillac NFL Golf Classic on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Crampton, who won this seniors event last year, is a rarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know only 3 percent of all the senior tournaments have
been won by players 60 years or older,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it is lower than that, about 1.3 percent. Of 532
tournaments, only 7 have gone to golfers older than 60. Only 1 of
the winners was older than 61, and it has been 13 years since that
happened.
</P>
<P>
   The answer to that trivia question? Mike Fetchick, who at age 63
won the Hilton Head Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   Crampton is 5 feet 9 inches tall and weighs less than 180
pounds. As he has aged, he has had to change his swing. The style
that helped him win 14 tournaments on the regular PGA Tour was fine
for a younger man, he said. But it does not cut it on the tour for
players 50 and over.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get older and you swivel this way,'' he said, turning
his body at an extreme angle, ``you start to get back problems. So
I've tried to make it a rounder swing, keeping my back straighter
to save my body.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not merely the yardage that seniors lose that affects
their game, Crampton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of the little things he said. ``The fact you know
what you should be doing, but just can't get the body to do it
exactly that way. Look, when you're driving a car at 60, it's not
the same as driving it at 25. When you try to thread a needle at
60, it's not as easy as it used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Trent Dilfer, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' quarterback and
one of the best golfers among the football players, said: ``I've
learned more with these guys. What I've seen about the seniors is
they're so in control of their game. One thing about football
players is we tend to play golf like we play football.''
</P>
<P>
   Dilfer pointed out that Crampton ``wasn't spectacular'' in the
opening round, ``but he took what the golf course gave him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He made his share of 15- and 20-foot putts,'' Dilfer said.
</P>
<P>
   The age of the players also gives the senior tour its special
profile. Most major sports associations are not concerned about the
prostate cancer among its membership. But the tour has two players,
Arnold Palmer and Jim Colbert, who battled the illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to, but I've become an expert on it,'' Palmer
said.
</P>
<P>
   The seniors also travel with two physical therapists and a
chiropractor. Palmer has had back problems going back to the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got it,'' he said, ``we thought it was a hip
problem. But it was a vertebrae problem and it just got worse.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Schueren, one of the physical therapists on the tour, said:
``Think about what a golfer does. They hit the ball 300 times a
day, seven days a week. Add up the years.''
</P>
<P>
   The odds against winning this event does not concern Crampton, a
native Australian.
</P>
<P>
   ``No 60-year-old has won a tournament this year,'' Crampton
said. ``But that adds additional flavor to our events, that a
60-year-old can still compete.''
</P>
<P>
   CHIP SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   _ The Professional Caddies Association has signed a seven-figure
deal with BUM equipment to promote its products, and that means the
caddies will be wearing logos on their shirts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Quarterbacks don't compete head-to-head, except in tournaments
of this nature. ``I know it sounds immodest,'' TRENT DILFER of the
Buccaneers said, ``but JOHN ELWAY and I are the best golfers among
quarterbacks. If John's not in a tourney, I don't really see myself
competing against another quarterback.'' Dilfer shot a 76 in the
opening round to come into the weekend tied for third among the
football players.

   EDWARDSVILLE, Ill. _ Angela Williams of Ontario, Calif., set a
national high school record of 11.11 seconds in the final of the
girls' 100-meter dash Friday night at the national junior
championships.
</P>
<P>
   Williams broke one of the longest-standing high school records,
the 11.13 run by Chandra Cheeseborough of Jacksonville, Fla., at
the 1976 U.S. Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
   The first two finishers in each event here qualify for the world
junior championships in Annecy, France, July 28-Aug. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Hot and humid weather, with temperatures in the mid-90s, made
times fast in the sprints and slow in the distances.
</P>
<P>
   The Barber twins of Montclair, N.J., Melisa and Mikele, stepped
up in class here Friday, with mixed results. Last weekend in
Raleigh, N.C. the 17-year-old Barber sisters swept the sprints in
the national scholastic track and field championships. Melisa won
the 100 meters in 11.74 seconds and the 200 in 23.94, while Mikele
won the 400 in 52.56, the year's fastest high school time.
</P>
<P>
   Here at the national junior meet, which allow athletes under age
20, the Barbers faced a number of college athletes as well as some
leading high school runners who skipped last week's meet to prepare
for this one.
</P>
<P>
   Mikele ran first and won her qualifying heat of the 400 by six
meters in a swift but easy looking 53.64. Only another heat winner,
Nakia Johnson of Chino Hills, Calif., ran faster, clocking 53.26.
</P>
<P>
   Melisa Barber did not fare as well. She won her heat of the 100
meters in 11.62, but didn't qualify for the final when she finished
sixth in her semifinal in 11.72.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a busy week,'' Mikele said. ``We had the high school
nationals last weekend, then Monday was graduation. The next day we
had to go to our best friend's funeral; she died in an auto
accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we had a plane delay coming here and we didn't get into
the hotel until 11 o'clock last night. I think we're both a little
tired.''
</P>
<P>
   In the preliminaries of the men's 110-meter hurdles, Todd
Matthews of Trenton won his heat in a wind-aided 13.83 seconds.
Only one high school boy has run faster: Renaldo Nehemiah of Scotch
Plains, N.J., in 1977. He went on to become a world record-holder.
</P>
<P>
   The men's 100 meters final was won by Tory Mitchell of Big
Spring, Texas, in a wind-aided time of 10.12.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Kutzing, of Port Jefferson, N.Y., won the women's
5,000-meter race walk by more than 150 meters in 24:42.97. She will
be joined on the U.S. national team in France by her fellow Long
Islander Keyon Soley of Uniondale, who finished second in the
girls' long jump at 20 feet 7\ inches, three-quarters of an inch
behind Myra Combs of Louisiana State.

IN HINE FAMILY FIRM, SKIP AWAY'S A PARTNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sonny Hine sat in the little office in Barn 1 at Belmont Park in
New York last week and reflected on the impact that Skip Away had
had on his life: winning 15 races, running in the money 30 times in
33 starts and earning $8.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly Hine reflected on the impact that he expected Skip
Away to make during the next four months as he enters the
homestretch of a career with one purpose: to become the richest
horse in racing history.
</P>
<P>
   It is more of a family business than anything else. Hine is the
trainer and his wife, Carolyn, is the nominal owner of Skip Away,
the gray 5-year-old champion. They all started the stretch run
Thursday when they crossed the continent with Skip Away. The colt
is set to confront Gentlemen on Sunday in the $1 million Hollywood
Gold Cup in California. And make no mistake, Hine considers Skip
Away a partner in the family business, not the family pet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's all business,'' Hine said. ``He's a business horse. He's
very sharp. He doesn't want to be petted or hugged. If you're in
his stall working on his legs, he won't attack you. But he doesn't
want you petting him, except for my wife. He listens to her. If
he's eating and she calls, he'll come to her. Otherwise, he's all
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Big business. After some anxious moments last weekend when his
legs showed some swelling, Skip Away headed west with a winning
streak of six races, five of them Grade 1 stakes. They are the $1
million Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont Park last October, the $4
million Breeders' Cup Classic at Hollywood Park in November, the
$300,000 Donn at Gulfstream Park in February, the $250,000
Gulfstream Park Handicap in March and the $750,000 Pimlico Special
in May.
</P>
<P>
   He took a slight cut in quality but still collected first prize
in the $500,000 Massachusetts Handicap at Suffolk Downs in Boston
in late May. Then he came home to Belmont Park to rest for
Gentlemen and Silver Charm and any other challengers waiting in the
second half of his final season at the races.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to surpass Cigar's record haul of $9.9 million and
become racing's first $10 million horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could just go to the Breeders' Cup and go over the top,''
Hine said. ``But he's been in training constantly for four years
now, and he'll race his way up to the Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he wins the Hollywood Gold Cup, he'll get first prize of
$600,000 and would reach $8.9 million. In the Pacific Classic in
August, he could reach $9.5 million. The Woodward in New York has a
small purse, but he would reach $9.9 million. And he would pass $10
million in the Jockey Club Gold Cup. Then the Breeders' Cup
Classic, with first prize of $2.5 million, would put him way
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Having charted the final strides for his business horse with
precision and profit, Hine allowed himself to look further ahead,
and said: ``We want him to stay healthy and go to stud. That's
where the real money is. He can make more money standing than
running.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Skip Away is running, Hine will continue to press for
recognition for his star, who has been voted the 3-year-old
champion and the champion older horse but has twice lost the vote
for Horse of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets respect,'' the trainer said, ``from the racing
secretaries when they assign the weights.''
</P>
<P>
   Hine seems determined to make his horse not only the richest but
also the most honored in the business. He cannot understand why
people would object, especially Bob Baffert, the trainer of Silver
Charm and Real Quiet, who won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness the
last two years.
</P>
<P>
   The two trainers have exchanged volleys in a war of words over
who is ducking whom. The obstacle to a confrontation had seemed
cleared when Silver Charm was booked into the Hollywood Gold Cup
last Friday. But Silver Charm withdrew Wednesday when he developed
a fever.
</P>
<P>
   Hine still reached for respect for Skip Away, and found it. ``He
gets mail every day,'' Hine said. ``One letter made me cry. It was
from a teen-aged girl whose daddy took her to the Jockey Club Gold
Cup the year before last when Skip Away beat Cigar. She bet 10
bucks on Skippy and won. But not long after that day, her father
had a stroke and passed away. Now, every time Skippy runs, she
relates back to her father and how he took her to the track to see
him run for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with sentiment, Sonny Hine lives on strategy. He has
already dug deep into Cigar's experience and concludes that Del Mar
brought an end to that horse's 16-race winning streak in 1996 by
trapping him with a surface that was softer and deeper and more
tiring than usual and with two horses in tandem who made him run
too fast, early and late.
</P>
<P>
   ``Skip Away worked very good over a heavy track here last
week,'' Hine said. ``My rider that morning was Angel Cordero. He
also worked him before the Pimlico Special, so this was his second
trip. I wanted him to tell me about the surface. Angel said Skippy
looked like the best horse he'd ridden since Seattle Slew.''
</P>
<P>
   With that attitude and $10 million in sight, let the stretch run
begin. &QL;

BACK FROM THE DEAD FOR THE U.S.A. 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE WISE   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The tryout roster for the U.S. team in the world basketball
championships is still at 50 players and may not be whittled down
until practice starts July 8. But in its infancy, Dream Team IV is
already beginning to follow the plot line of other desperate
sequels:
</P>
<P>
   Bring back some character from the dead, prop him up and pray he
can act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, a bunch of CBA guys probably won't catch too many
people's attention, but we might get some people like a Dominique
Wilkins,'' said Rod Thorn, the National Basketball Association's
vice president of operations. ``Or Byron Scott.''
</P>
<P>
   Clyde Drexler, who retired this season and will coach at the
University of Houston next season, is also contemplating playing in
Athens.
</P>
<P>
   USA Basketball's attempt to field a competitive team began in
earnest after NBA players decided to boycott the July 29-Aug. 9
world tournament. Their protest of an expected lockout this week by
the NBA owners left the selection committee digging up careers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in the case of Wilkins and Scott, you can cut them,
exile them and tell them they can't play, but they keep coming
back.
</P>
<P>
   Drexler is the player representative on the selection committee,
one of 12 members who chose Gary Payton, Chris Webber, Grant Hill,
Allan Houston and eight other players to represent the United
States in the games this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Although USA Basketball is independent of the NBA, the players'
association believes the marketing of NBA players overseas is
directly tied to the league's image and merchandising.
</P>
<P>
   As for foreign citizens who play in the NBA, they may go to
Greece no matter what. Steve Nash is expected to play with Canada,
Detlef Schrempf with Germany, Vlade Divac with Yugoslavia and Toni
Kukoc with Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday is Witching Hour
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, NBA business will come to a standstill
Wednesday. A telephone conference call scheduled for Monday or
Tuesday is expected to end with the owners unanimously in favor of
suspending all trades and free-agent acquisitions until a new
collective bargaining agreement with the players is signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never say never, but all signs point to a lockout at this
time,'' said Russ Granik, the league's deputy commissioner.``We
haven't made much progress since we began and there are no meetings
currently scheduled.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week's negotiation broke off after only 30 minutes, with
the players' association's president, Patrick Ewing, and its
executive director, Billy Hunter, leaving the bargaining table
without ever hearing a new proposal.
</P>
<P>
   With the union scheduling a golf outing in Hawaii from July
3-12, it does not appear much headway will be made next month
either.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell and Riley?
</P>
<P>
   It is probably nothing but talk-radio speculation, but when Pat
Riley and Latrell Sprewell pop up in the same sentence, you start
to wonder. Would Riley take the biggest gamble of his career and
trade for Image Problem?
</P>
<P>
   With a strong desire to move Voshon Lenard and perhaps either
Jamal Mashburn or P.J. Brown, Riley is considering every possible
option, a Western Conference team official said. The only problem
is, the Golden State Warriors are probably stuck with Sprewell _
whose choking of P.J. Carlesimo set off a national debate and the
longest suspension in league history _ until at least the end of
July.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the manner in which Sprewell's contract is
structured, the Warriors will not receive equal value on his $8
million annual salary in a trade until the two-year anniversary of
his contract signing at the end of next month. With the lockout
pending, Sprewell will probably be a Warrior for the summer.
</P>
<P>
   But what a teary reunion it would be for Sprewell and Tim
Hardaway in Miami. They had one of the biggest running feuds in the
league when they played together, giving each other death stares on
the court and warring on the bench during timeouts. Something about
passing the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Another sappy scene: Mashburn's possibly going to Golden State
and playing alongside his old Dallas teammate, Jim Jackson. They
didn't get along, either.
</P>
<P>
   Camby's Doubters
</P>
<P>
   Toronto coach Butch Carter was so ecstatic over obtaining
Charles Oakley that he pleaded with a confidant the day before the
deal was made not to say anything to anyone about it. The reason:
</P>
<P>
   ``If Patrick Ewing ever gets wind of this, he'll veto the whole
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing, who has often let Knicks management know his strong
feelings about keeping Oakley in the past, actually signed off on
the trade that brought Marcus Camby to New York last Thursday. But
many more in the organization were not convinced that getting Camby
automatically made the Knicks a stronger contender in the Eastern
Conference. Privately, two high-ranking team employees questioned
the wisdom of the trade.
</P>
<P>
   However tough it might be, parting with Oakley was not the
problem, they said under condition of anonymity. The general belief
among the Knicks was that Oakley was wearing down. But acquiring
Camby caused the most consternation. Wingspan and blocked shots
aside, the thinking was that the injury-prone Camby, 24, is not
much better at this stage of his career than John Wallace, the 1996
first-round draft pick whom the Knicks moved to Toronto last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   As for Oakley, he is planning a news conference in New York next
week and has said he will not bite his tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Often critical of spin-control management types and teammates he
did not think were totally committed to the cause of winning a
title, Oakley may get a tad nasty.
</P>
<P>
   He was in Richmond when the Knicks' president, Ernie Grunfeld,
caught up with him and broke the news. His sister said he was in
North Carolina on Thursday. Like his prospects for a championship,
he is going South.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps finding out he will soon be a resident of Ontario and a
Raptor employee made him run for another border.
</P>
<P>
   Tough Trip for Van Exel
</P>
<P>
   Unhappy Camper, Part II.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Van Exel also went from the showroom to the clearance rack
on draft night, moving from the glare and promise of the Los
Angeles Lakers to the dim and dilapidated Denver Nuggets. Van
Exel's agent, James Bryant, told the both The Los Angeles Times and
The Rocky Mountain News last week that his client would consider
not reporting to Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Though Nuggets general manager Dan Issel finally had his first
telephone conversation with Van Exel on Friday, and tried to
promise good things, the mercurial point guard was not scheduled on
a flight to Denver over the weekend, a team official said.
</P>
<P>
   He has until 4 p.m. Monday to report to the club under the
collective bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   On the bright side for Van Exel, he is a shoot-first,
pass-and-ask-questions-later point guard and no longer has to worry
about such menial tasks as, say, giving up the ball.

EDITORIAL: STANDING UP TO THE HOUSE BULLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The N.Y. Times said in an editorial, Sunday, June 28:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Panic has gripped the House leadership. One sure sign is the way
Speaker Newt Gingrich and his team try scheme after scheme to block
campaign-finance reform. In the latest maneuver, Gingrich has
signed on to a move to threaten removal of independent-minded
Republicans from their House leadership positions if they continue
to support legislation opposed by the Speaker _ in this case the
bill to ban soft-money contributions to the national parties.
</P>
<P>
   The threat runs counter to Gingrich's own stated vision for
cleaning up the House. The man who arrived in Congress as a
reformer has become the guardian of its debased, influence-peddling
status quo.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of the speaker's wrath is the petition signed by
several Republicans this spring demanding a vote on the
Shays-Meehan legislation to outlaw unlimited special-interest
donations to the Republican and Democratic national committees.
Only when it became clear that the petition was going to get a
majority did Gingrich relent and promise a vote. Now a dozen
diehard Republicans are circulating their own petition to the GOP
Steering Committee, suggesting that it think twice about handing
out top committee posts to anyone defying the leadership on
important issues. In an unusual step, Gingrich signed the petition
himself.
</P>
<P>
   The paradox is, of course, that Republicans were themselves all
too happy to get Democrats to sign discharge petitions when the
Democrats controlled the House. Gingrich led such a move some years
ago to get a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget
out of committee. As a rebel, he stood for independent thinking by
lawmakers and repeatedly condemned the Democrats' financial
shenanigans. Now he has changed his tune, and is said to be
especially irritated at the actions of Christopher Shays of
Connecticut, Republican co-sponsor of the campaign reform bill, and
also of Jim Leach, the banking committee chairman who signed the
campaign reform petition and has one of the GOP's best records for
curbing campaign donations from groups affected by his committee.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of responding to Gingrich's threats, House members
should listen to a growing number of business leaders who also
favor cleaning up the system. Last week, about 20 Republican
members met in the Capitol basement with Warren Buffett, Jerome
Kohlberg and influential investors who said that the integrity of
American democracy was jeopardized by the unlimited corporate
contributions that the Shays-Meehan bill would end. Buffett warned
pointedly that if change is not made now, it will be harder to
bring about in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Last week The Wall Street Journal also reported that House
Republicans were assured they need not worry about killing off
comprehensive tobacco legislation because the industry would pay
for television ad campaigns to support those who stood by it. Were
reform to pass, such ads would be subject to strict fund-raising
limitations that govern direct donations to candidates, as they
should be.
</P>
<P>
   With each revelation of naked congressional greed, Americans
grow more disgusted by a legislature that puts its conscience out
for bids. When Congress returns from its recess in mid-July, it has
no higher priority than listening to the public's demand for change
and, perforce, finding the spine to stand up to the bully from
Georgia. &QL;

SMOKE, RAIN AND RAINBOWS: JUST ANOTHER DAY AT WIMBLEDON 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Some say this place is doomed. Some say it
should be domed.
</P>
<P>
   Even though hail was in the forecast, fire and rain, along with
a redemptive evening rainbow, were the main players Saturday at
Wimbledon. While weather intrusions are the tiresome norm around
here, there was also the novel disruption of an afternoon fire at
an adjacent high-rise apartment building. The blaze required the
evacuation of Court 18 because of billowing black smoke that posed
a potential health hazard; The Associated Press reported that one
woman from the building was treated for smoke inhalation.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Martin, the two-time Wimbledon semifinalist who along with
defending champion, Pete Sampras, represents the last of the
American men still in contention, was ahead, 6-4, 4-6, 7-6 (7-1),
2-2 in his third-round encounter with Australia's Todd Woodbridge
when police and fire officials closed down the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who says we have to play in front of people?'' pleaded Martin,
who felt it better to continue playing than risk getting rained
out, which is exactly what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Over on Court 1, where the smoke was less dense but still an
annoyance, sixth-seeded Monica Seles and Indonesia's Yayuk Basuki
were commanded to play on even though both suspected the air was
contaminated from the smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just so strange with the fire, I was hoping it's OK to
breathe this air in, and both Yayuk and I felt we should stop,''
Seles said after the 6-2, 6-3 victory, ``but in the end, it was
probably better to just go on. We've seen everything today.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Round of 16, Seles faces 14th-seeded Sandrine Testud, the
player who ambushed her here last year in the third round and ended
her Italian Open run this year. But Seles said she's a far more
focused player now. In the last two losses to Testud, Seles was
wracked with guilt about playing at all instead of being at home in
Florida to comfort her father, Karolj, who succumbed to cancer last
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I don't have doubts and I don't feel guilt,'' Seles
said, ``so that makes it easier, gives me peace of mind, and I
think that translates on the court, too.''
</P>
<P>
   While the rest of the supporting cast tried in vain to play
catch-up in the brief sunny spells, the defending champion Martina
Hingis, her Cheshire cat grin back in place after pouting through a
lackluster second-round outing, played cat-and-mouse with Yelena
Likhovseva.
</P>
<P>
   Had it been permissible to tear her opponent into tiny pieces
and toss her into the center court breeze, the 17-year-old Hingis
probably would have chosen that mischievous option. Instead of
inflicting actual bodily harm on the flustered Likhovseva, Hingis,
undefeated in 10 consecutive Wimbledon matches, merely toyed with
the Russian and advanced by a comfortable 6-2, 6-1 margin into the
Round of 16.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis has already won four Grand Slam titles in her career, and
she won't stop collecting until she has tallied 28 Grand Slam
victims in a calendar year, the feat Steffi Graf performed in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more matches you play, the more confident you are,'' said
Hingis, who has the kind of confidence that Graf had before
injuries reduced her from tenacious to tentative. ``She was on the
other side,'' Hingis said, referring to Graf, a seven-time
Wimbledon champion, ``and we would only meet in the final, so I
don't really care if she is in or out.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite her breezy words, Hingis doubtless prefers that Graf,
the only top player with a winning record against her, is out, a
third-round victim of Natasha Zvereva on Friday. Now four rounds
away from defending the title that last year made her the youngest
Wimbledon champion since Lottie Dodd in 1887, Hingis remains on
target to become the youngest champion since Dodd to successfully
defend the championship.

</P>
<P>
   It seems a lifetime ago that Conchita Martinez prevented Martina
Navratilova from attaining a record-breaking 10th Wimbledon title
when she dealt her a surprise defeat in their 1994 final. Since
then, Martinez, of Spain, has managed no more Slam titles, and
Saturday she was thumped from contention, 2-6, 6-3, 7-5, by
Britain's own Samantha Smith. The 94th-ranked Smith had never
before managed to pass Wimbledon's first round and was trounced,
6-1, 6-0, by Martinez when they met last year at the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say it's the most disappointing loss ever,'' said
Martinez, who led, 4-1, when the match was suspended by rain Friday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   This morning when they reconvened, the pixieish Smith, who
prefers to be called Sam, stuck to the classic serve-volley,
chip-charge style that England seems to cultivate in its tennis
hopefuls. But Martinez, who normally wields a sniper's passing
shot, apparently never woke up in time for the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was there, I think I am much more superior, but today I
felt that I was not there,'' Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   The 55th-ranked Chanda Rubin kept her mind on the immediate
problem of a 7-7 third-set deadlock with Tara Snyder. Rubin emerged
the victor, 3-6, 7-5, 11-9.
</P>
<P>
   MATCH POINTS  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two of the seeded men with games replete with the stylish
strokes required to win on grass, third-seeded Petr Korda and the
local hero, the 12th-seeded Tim Henman, moved into the Round of 16.
Korda eliminated Jerome Golmard, 4-6, 7-5, 7-5, 7-5. And Henman,
who next faces the reigning U.S. Open champion, Patrick Rafter,
gratified the center court crowd by picking up where he left off on
Friday night and downing Zimbabwe's Byron Black, 6-4, 6-4, 3-6,
7-5. . . . ... Once the unseeded Dutchman Jan Siemerink disposed of
11th-seeded Jonas Bjorkman, 7-6 (8-6), 5-7, 2-6, 6-4, 7-5,
out-acing him 15-2, there were just two seeds left on the bottom
half of the men's draw, including Siemerink's compatriot,
ninth-seeded Richard Krajicek, whose third-round match with
Germany's Nicolas Kiefer was rained out after three games.

   UPTON, Maine _ Ruth Kirchmeier and I caught few landlocked
salmon on a recent trip to Lake Umbagog and the Rapid River, but we
did get hooked on Alain de Botton's ``How Proust Can Change Your
Life.'' The book didn't alter our lives, but it brightened our
wind-buffeted camp as we sat out one gale after another, waiting
for a lull of sufficient duration to allow us to go fishing.
</P>
<P>
   A stiff breeze had greeted us at the trip's start when we
launched our canoe on the Androscoggin River in Errol, N.H., and
went three miles upstream to where the river flows out of the lake
on the New Hampshire side. From there, it is about two and a half
miles across the lake to where the Rapid River enters from the
Maine shore. Whitecaps were forming when we went out on the lake,
but pushed along at four or five knots by our two-horsepower
outboard, we were more than halfway across when the wind picked up
and we began to take water over the port bow, requiring Ruth to
bail continuously.
</P>
<P>
   I altered our course, even though this made the trip longer, in
order to take the waves head on, and when I was directly upwind of
the camp, I turned and ran with them. By that time, the long,
shallow lake was a froth of white with three-foot swells. Our
venerable 20-foot Grumman aluminum canoe was heavily laden and
would often tend to bury her bow as we slid down the face of a
swell, forcing me to throttle back time and again.
</P>
<P>
   We rent the camp, which is on the south shore of the Rapid River
at the juncture of river and lake, from Dick and Liz Celli of
Lenox, Mass. They awaited us at their dock, having come over the
day before in their pontoon boat to ready the place for our
arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Dick's first words were, ``I never thought you'd bring Ruth
across on a day like this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I share your incredulity,'' I responded.
</P>
<P>
   While I sorted out my gear, Ruth boated upriver to Cedar Stump
and the river's outlet pool with the Cellis. From there they hiked
up the Carry Road to visit with Aldro French. French and his
partner, Joan Magrauth, have launched a guiding service on the
Rapid River for trout and salmon anglers. (Their address is P.O.
Box 404, Middle Dam, Andover, Maine 04216.) Their base on the Rapid
River is French's Forest Lodge and Winter House, formerly owned by
Louise Dickinson Rich, whose 1942 best seller, ``We Took to the
Woods,'' described her life in the Rapid River wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   The Cellis left camp the next day and, I learned later, got to
the opposite shore just ahead of a torrential rain squall and a
short-lived gale out of the southeast.
</P>
<P>
   During a period of calm that evening, Ruth and I went to the
outlet pool. I made fewer than six casts before a fierce electrical
storm sent us scuttling back to camp. I had no wish to be sitting
in an aluminum canoe waving a graphite rod under such conditions.
As we headed back with lightning all about us, Ruth observed, ``It
might not be a bad way to go: quick and in a spot we love.''
</P>
<P>
   I responded, ``I have promises to keep and miles to go before I
sleep.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The following afternoon we spent a few hours at the outlet pool.
The river was high and the fishing was slow. I caught, all on a
Muddler Minnow, one 11-inch brook trout, four 12-inch salmon and
two big white suckers.
</P>
<P>
   The Rapid River is fly-fishing only, all brook trout must be
released, and only one salmon a day 14 or more inches long may be
kept. After Aug. 15, no salmon may be kept.
</P>
<P>
   The Rapid River, particularly upstream at Pond in the River, has
some huge brook trout. The salmon, at least the ones I've caught
over the past decade, are not unusually large. A three-pounder is
something to brag about. The river's attraction is its remoteness
and its tumultuous descent to Lake Umbagog, which is now the heart
of a national wildlife refuge.
</P>
<P>
   In the five days that followed, I fished for less than a total
of eight hours, and it was impossible to go out on three of them.
We sat in camp reading, or watching storm clouds build over the
mountains to the northwest and torrents of wind, sometimes gusting
to 50 miles an hour, rip across the lake, lifting sheets of spray
from the whitecaps. That week, a record June wind howled across the
top of Mount Washington: 137 miles an hour. Rain drummed on the
aluminum roof every day but one, and most of the nights. The
temperature was in the low 40s by midnight, sometimes rising to 50
at noon.
</P>
<P>
   We fired up the wood stove _ Celli keeps a good supply of dry,
split hardwood logs on hand _ and took turns reading the Proust
book. I encountered a Proust I had not known, and de Botton's
approach to his subject was varied, humorous and brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   That done, we savored Jill Ker Conway's ``The Road from
Coorain,'' a shining, stirring account of her early years in
Australia. I was much less enchanted by a college poetry textbook
that I had mistaken _ when hastily packing for the trip _ for an
equally battered Thomas Hardy collection of poems. Ruth turned to
Mary Gordon's latest novel ``Spending.''
</P>
<P>
   On the penultimate day, the wind slackened off in the late
afternoon and we went to the outlet pool, where, after flailing
away with a Muddler and assorted dry flies for two hours with no
success, I switched to a Black Ghost and caught a 15-inch salmon on
my first cast. On my second cast with the same fly, I was fast to a
heavy fish. I knew that it wasn't a salmon because it fought deep
and doggedly with no acrobatics. Ten minutes later, it was in the
canoe, a six-pound female largemouth bass. This was a surprise.
Largemouths are devotees of still waters and I was fishing at the
foot of a rapids.
</P>
<P>
   We bore the two fish _ the only ones we killed on the entire
trip _ back to camp. I baked the bass, Ruth made an almond and
butter sauce for it, and we served it with white rice, freeze-dried
green peas and a salad. The salmon was eaten raw in thin slices
with pickled ginger, wasabi mustard and crackers and the last of
our wine, a triumphant repast, albeit no banquet. &QL;

 &HT;    INTERNET SAFETY TIPS FOR PARENTS
 &HT;    Staff Report
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tips for parents:
</P>
<P>
   _ Never allow children to have computers in their rooms or any
part of the house where they could have unsupervised access to the
Internet. Keep the computer in a public area of the home and make
unannounced checks to see what your children are doing on-line.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use services provided by your Internet Service Provider or
commercially available software to block access to chat rooms or
inappropriate sites.
</P>
<P>
   _ Instruct your children to never give out identifying
information such as name, address, telephone number or school name
in a public message forum such as a chat room.
</P>
<P>
   _ Encourage your children not to respond to any messages or
bulletin boards that are suggestive, obscene, belligerent,
threatening, or that make them feel uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stress to your children that the 12- or 13-year-old girl or
boy they think they may be chatting with on-line may actually be an
adult. Pedophiles often compile profiles of children before
recruiting them to become victims.
</P>
<P>
   _ Advise your children not to upload photographs of themselves
to anyone they do not know personally. They may be providing those
photographs to a pedophile.
</P>
<P>
   _ Your children should be instructed to never download
photographs from anyone they do not personally know. They could be
receiving pornography.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stress to your children the dangers of arranging face-to-face
meetings with someone they have met on the Internet.
</P>

 &HT;    Internet spreading child porn, investigators say
 &HT;    By Ron Martz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Federal investigators say it was not unusual for
25-year-old Stephen Parrish of Atlanta to spend six hours a day in
front of his computer, cruising the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike most people who use the Internet for research or
legitimate entertainment, Parrish had a more sinister motive,
searching for child pornography and stalking young boys in teen
chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Last month in U.S. District Court in Atlanta, Parrish had his
probation revoked for a previous child pornography conviction in
Florida and was sentenced to eight years and a month in federal
prison. Prosecutors said the sentence was one of the longest in
memory for probation revocation but was justified because of
Parrish's obssession with child pornography and young boys.
</P>
<P>
   That type of on-line obssession is not unusual for pedophiles
and some child molesters, investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen people who spend 12 to 18 hours a day on their
computers doing this. They hardly have time to eat or sleep,'' said
Gene Weinschenk, director of the Cyberspace Smuggling Center for
the U.S. Customs Service in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Parrish is among what federal officials believe is a growing
number of people, mostly male, who are using their computers to
collect and distribute child pornography and to cruise numerous
unmonitored chat rooms in search of potential underage sex
partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of a dirty old man in a trenchcoat hanging out by the
school yard, now you have dirty old men on the computer,'' said Pat
Johnson, supervisory special agent in charge of Crimes Against
Children investigations in the FBI's Atlanta office.
</P>
<P>
   The ``dirty old men'' have turned out to be pillars of the
community in some instances.
</P>
<P>
   _ The former city manager of Camilla, Ga., and his wife were
sentenced to 50 years in prison earlier this month after pleading
guilty to molesting the woman's two children. Investigators say the
couple had sex with the two teenage boys, photographed the acts and
distributed the photos and videos on the Internet while collecting
thousands of other images of child pornography on their computer.
</P>
<P>
   _ An Alpharetta father of five and youth-league baseball coach
pleaded guilty in May to transporting, distributing and possessing
child pornography. He was arrested on his way to St. Louis to meet
who he believed was a 13-year-old girl he had courted on the
Internet. The girl turned out to be an adult police officer who was
part of a sting operation.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Lafayette, La., a former Boy Scout leader and his one-time
roommate were each sentenced to 19 years and seven months in prison
for sexually exploiting children and producing child pornography.
Investigators found more than 1,800 images of child pornography on
computer equipment used by the men.
</P>
<P>
   _ Since January, customs officials say, they have arrested a
minister, a church choir leader, a pediatrician and the former head
of the child abuse unit of the New Orleans Police Dept., all on
child pornography charges and all involving use of computers.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agent Kenneth Lanning, who specializes in cases involving
the sexual victimization of children for the bureau's Behavioral
Science Unit in Quantico, Va., said customs had virtually wiped out
importation of child pornography by the late 1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the advent of high-speed modems and computers made child
porn easily accessible from anywhere in the world,'' Lanning said.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet also has enabled pedophiles and child molesters to
more easily communicate with others like themselves, Lanning said.
``They spend a lot of time on-line with people who are like them in
an effort to validate their own behavior and feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Customs officials say the surge in use of personal computers is
directly linked to a marked increase in their arrests for kiddie
smut. In fiscal year 1995 Customs recorded 48 arrests for child
pornography. The following year that number doubled to 96 and in
1997 it jumped again to 136. As of April 1, 1998, Customs had
recorded 104 child porn arrests.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the problem, the FBI set up an anti-child porn
unit called ``Innocent Images'' that Johnson says is ``the most
overt undercover operation in the country.'' Originally started in
1993 as an investigation into a missing 10-year-old Baltimore boy,
agents soon learned that a number of children in their area had
been sexually exploited over a period of time and that computers
were routinely being used to transmit images of child pornography
involving them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (investigation) gave rise to the fact that this was a
national problem. Until that time we had no idea about the scope
and magnitude of the problem,'' said FBI agent Pete Gulotta, a
former member of the Innocent Images squad.
</P>
<P>
   Innocent Images is now a nationwide undercover operation that
attempts to identify individuals who use computers to recruit
underage sex partners and those who distribute child pornography on
a large scale. The operation has become something of a
clearinghouse and repository for the FBI on child pornography and
child molesters who cross state lines to find their victims, known
to investigators as travellers.
</P>
<P>
   Since its inception Innocent Images has obtained 181 arrests,
176 indictments, and 201 convictions (some individuals were
convicted of multiple offenses).
</P>
<P>
   Convicting pedophiles and child pornographers is usually not
difficult because many keep large collections and meticulous
records, according to Janice Jenkins, an assistant U.S. attorney
who prosecutes child porn cases in the Northern District of
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the cases plead out because usually there is just so
much evidence,'' said Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   In one case prosecuted by Jenkins she said a doctor was caught
when he inadvertently left his computer on with a screen-saver that
showed two young boys having sex. His maid saw it and called
police.
</P>
<P>
   ``For these people it's not a matter of thinking; it's a matter
of need,'' Jenkins said.
</P>
<P>
   What investigators and sex therapists are still trying to
determine is whether the Internet is prompting the seeming
explosion of child pornography or merely making it easier to get to
the material.
</P>
<P>
   ``This problem became more apparent as the Internet grew,'' said
Larry Faust, spokesman for the FBI's Baltimore office and Innocent
Images. ``It isn't necessarily growing. It's always been there.
We're just discovering the magnitude of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Strickland, a psychotherapist at the Highland Institutue
for Behavioral Change in Atlanta who treats pedophiles and other
sex offenders, said ``we're definitely seeing more people in
treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   She attributes part of that to the FBI's interest and ability in
tracking down pedophiles who use their computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people they are going to catch are the obsessive
pedophiles who spend a lot of time on the Internet looking for
pictures or in chat rooms. That's their interest. That's their
arousal,'' Strickland said.
</P>
<P>
   And while Strickland said child molesters usually do not spend
as much time on the Internet as those who collect porn, there are
exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the more horrific cases on record, FBI officials say
that in 1996 they broke up the U.S. portion of a child porn ring in
which members linked their computers so they could watch children
being molested on-line. What was known as the Orchid Club allegedly
had members in nine states and four countries. The members
exchanged still pictures and videos of child pornography that
included real-time molestation of several children 10 and younger.
Sixteen people were indicted and three men are now serving federal
terms ranging from 30 to 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more insidious aspects of computer technology and its
relation to child pornography is a technique called morphing. Those
familiar with the technique can download photographs of innocent
children from an individual's home page about his family and morph
them into sexually explicit photographs that are then widely
distributed on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials and investigators believe they are
only seeing a small portion of the problem with the Internet and
the computer age.
</P>
<P>
   Beryl Hedrick, an inspector who specializes in child pornography
for the U.S. Postal Service said that he has ``600 active cases
available for investigation at any one time'' in the region he
covers, which is Alabama, Georgia and the Panhandle of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am buried with investigations,'' he said.

   Hedrick estimates there are ``3,000-4,000 targets for potential
investigations of child pornography principally through the mail''
in his southeast region. ``It would be much, much higher if you
added computer cases. It's phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   In March the Atlanta FBI office put one agent full-time on cases
involving crimes against children, which includes sexual
exploitation and pornography. There have already been three
convictions with 13 cases still being investigated as a result of
increased emphasis on the problem, according to Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a week goes by that I don't get several tips,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is now considering legislation that would toughen
penalties for those who use their computers to lure kids into
having sex. Passed earlier this month in the House 416-0, the bill
would make it a federal crime to send obscene materials to minors,
possess even a single image of child pornography or to simply make
contact with anyone under 18 for the purpose of engaging in sexual
activity.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators and sex therapists are not sure it will be
enough for a situation that seems to be perilously close to
spinning out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is definitely a lot more of it out there than anybody
thought,'' Weinschenk said.

JACOB KATZ, 93, SOCIAL HISTORIAN OF THE JEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Professor Jacob Katz, an internationally known authority on the
history of the Jewish people, died May 20 in Hadassah Hospital in
Jerusalem. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Katz, who was born in Hungary, joined the faculty of Hebrew
University, in Jerusalem, in 1950 and went on to hold its Bella and
Israel Unterberg Memorial Chair of Jewish Social and Educational
History. From 1969 to 1972, when he retired from the university, he
was its chief academic officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of this century's greatest and most influential
historians of the Jews,'' said Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi, a professor
of Jewish history, culture and society at Columbia University.
Yerushalmi, who is also the director of Columbia's Center for
Israel and Jewish Studies, said: ``His work, always innovative, was
of incredibly wide scope, ranging freely through medieval and
modern times. No one working in Jewish history or interested in it
can ignore what he achieved.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz, an Orthodox Jew, has been called a pioneer in applying
social science methods to the writing of Jewish history. As a
social historian, he drew on his command of Talmudic and rabbinic
sources and also used what has been called a critical openness.
</P>
<P>
   His book ``Exclusiveness and Tolerance: Studies in
Jewish-Gentile Relations in Medieval and Modern Times'' (1961,
Behrman) has been applauded for its openness in speaking of all
aspects of that relationship, including tolerance and intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   He has also been called an innovator in writing about the
history of the traditional Jewish law in terms of the relationship
between social realities, including political and economic
developments, and the development of the law.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s and 1970s he was a visiting professor at Harvard,
Columbia and Brandeis Universities. He was also a member of the
American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Several of his books remain
in print in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Katz, who was born in Magyargencs, Hungary, pursued religious
studies and was ordained a rabbi. He went to Germany and received a
doctorate in social history from the University of Frankfurt in
1934. He settled in Palestine in 1936 and was a secondary school
teacher and administrator before he began teaching at Hebrew
University.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 62 years, the former Gerti
Birnbaum; three sons, David of Ashkelon, Israel, and Chanan and
Uriel, both of Jerusalem, and 11 grandchildren.

<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ It is difficult to imagine a man less
threatening than Herman Walker.
</P>
<P>
   Slowed by a stroke one year ago, Walker, 75, spends much of his
time in his dingy one-bedroom apartment here, passing the hours
with a Bible on his lap and stuffed animals scattered around him
like throw pillows on a fraying couch.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're company,'' Walker recently said, his words slightly
garbled. ``I look at them so much they're human to me.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to housing officials in Oakland, Walker poses a
danger to his fellow tenants in public housing. And if these
officials have their way, he and his menagerie will have to find a
new home.
</P>
<P>
   Three times last year, the housing authorities said, they found
cocaine or cocaine paraphernalia in Walker's apartment or in the
possession of a private caretaker and another visitor. Even though
Walker told officials he was not aware of the drugs, they moved to
evict him.
</P>
<P>
   A lawsuit that Walker and three others have filed in response to
eviction actions illustrates a growing conflict between federal
officials, who have urged local housing agencies to crack down on
illegal drug use, and some advocates for the poor, who say that
innocent people are falling victim to a Draconian offensive in the
war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 directive issued by President Clinton and the Department
of Housing and Urban Development ordered local agencies that
administer public housing to enforce a law holding tenants
responsible for any drug-related activity that occurs inside their
apartments or outside the premises by people living there.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Eviction Defense Center, a nonprofit
legal group, took the case of the four Oakland residents to federal
court in San Francisco to protest that directive. The case
represents one of the most serious legal challenges yet to the
policy, which has led to a sharp rise in drug-related evictions
among the roughly three million Americans living in public housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beyond unfairness,'' Ira Jacobowitz, one of the lawyers
working on the case with the center, said of the policy. ``Somebody
can be evicted whether or not they had any previous knowledge of,
participation in, or ability to control the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobowitz also noted that tenants could be evicted even if the
accusations of drug-related activity did not lead to criminal
convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, U.S. District Court Judge Charles R. Breyer issued a
preliminary injunction against the evictions of the four plaintiffs
in an opinion that questioned the part of the policy related to
drug-related activity outside an apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The policy on its face appears irrational,'' Breyer wrote,
``since the tenant has not engaged in any such activity or
knowingly allowed such activity to occur.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit charges that the enforcement of the federal
directive deprives tenants of their constitutional rights to due
process and freedom of association. A trial is expected later this
year. The resolution could have an impact on the aggressiveness
with which housing officials around the country pursue these
evictions.
</P>
<P>
   HUD spokesman Stan Vosper said he could not discuss the merits
of the case. But he said that the directive, known as the ``one
strike'' policy, was an effort to make public housing safer for all
residents and that local housing authorities had been urged to use
discretion on complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Randolph W. Hall, a lawyer for the Oakland Housing Authority,
said the eviction proceedings against the plaintiffs were justified
because the plaintiffs, at least indirectly, brought drug-related
activity into or near public housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at who the victims are: these hundreds of thousands of
mothers who lost their kids to drive-by shootings or can't take
their kids to the sand boxes,'' Hall said. ``You have to balance
their rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall said the Oakland Housing Authorities pursues dozens of
these evictions every year, only a small percentage of which are
contested.
</P>
<P>
   Two plaintiffs in the lawsuit are grandmothers whose
grandchildren, according to housing officials, were on the
apartments' leases and were found with marijuana in a parking lot
outside the apartments. Another plaintiff is a woman whose daughter
and son were separately found with cocaine outside the apartment,
housing officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In Walker's case, Hall said the multiple incidents showed
Walker's failure to discourage drug activity.
</P>
<P>
   But Judge Breyer cited the Americans With Disabilities Act in
saying that Walker's right to home health care would be compromised
by an obligation to supervise a caretaker's activities.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said there was a limit to his control over people who
come to his apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what you have on you,'' he said to a visiting
reporter. ``I'm not going to ask you, `What do you have on you?'''

 &HT;    Florida officials fear smoke will choke tourism
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ The headlines and television pictures tell
the story: Thousands of acres of Florida woodlands are ablaze,
blanketing huge areas with choking smoke and sending walls of fire
sometimes to the outskirts of developed areas.
</P>
<P>
   But with the lucrative July Fourth weekend approaching, Florida
tourism officials worry that the news coverage isn't telling the
complete story: Much of the state, including beaches, theme parks
and other attractions, has been largely untouched by the crisis,
they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drivers may experience temporary closures along some Florida
roadways due to limited visibility from forest fires,'' said Bud
Nocera, chief of Visit Florida, the state's tourism promotion
agency. ``But area attractions, beaches, golf courses and hotels
are still open for visitors.''
</P>
<P>
   While visitors won't have to run for their lives to escape a
fire, the smoke could inconvenience their vacation. And if they
plan to bring elderly family members, children or people with heart
or respiratory problems on their trip, they should call ahead to
see if visiting areas are affected by the fires.
</P>
<P>
   The brush fires have occurred primarily in the state's northeast
corner from Jacksonville to Daytona Beach. In places, including
some of Florida's most popular beaches, the smoke has been thick
enough at times to burn throats and eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for Atlantans is that one of their favorite
stretches of Florida beach, the Panhandle, has escaped the worst of
the fires and smoke.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news, especially for stock-car racing fans, is that
Volusia County, home of Daytona Beach International Speedway and
the Pepsi 400 race scheduled for July 4, has been one of the
hardest-hit places.
</P>
<P>
   However, the popular race is still on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Race fans should come on down,'' said John Story, the
speedway's chief spokesman. ``We haven't considered changing the
schedule in any way, shape or form. It has been smoky every
morning, but the winds shift in the afternoon and it blows away.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Panhandle, the nearest fire to Panama City was in Gulf
County, 40 miles to the east. That fire doesn't threaten the
beaches of Cape San Blas or St. George Island, both popular with
Atlanta residents, although it has sent some smoke over the beaches
at times, returning visitors have reported.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, Florida's most popular vacation destination _
Walt Disney World_ has also been largely unaffected by the fires.
Orlando has been hit by smoke at times in the past week, however,
with a thick haze blown over from the Volusia County fires, about
50 miles to the northeast. The city has also had elevated ozone
levels due largely to the heat and smog from cars.
</P>
<P>
   What Florida visitors may miss is getting to shoot off their own
fireworks for July Fourth. Gov. Lawton Chiles has banned all
personal fireworks because of the high fire danger. But July Fourth
revelers may still be able to see public displays; the ban exempts
licensed, organized exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Daytona Beach, the speedway, St. George Island and
Panama City Beach all plan to have their fireworks displays. At
least one meteorologist believes fire-dousing rain is on its
way.``We are seeing the end of the dry cycle,'' Eric Swartz, a
forecaster for the South Florida Water Management District, told
The Orlando Sentinel. ``For the past week, we have been seeing
thunderstorms over the southern two-thirds of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   By then end of the week, more than 160,000 acres had burned and
every Florida county but one _ Monroe, home of the Keys _ had been
hit by at least one fire. Some 100 structures have burned, one
person has died and 30 people have been injured.
</P>
<P>
   The fires have been limited mostly to rural areas. Flames neared
the small town of Waldo near Gainesville and licked the outskirts
of Jacksonville, but haven't directly threatened any major urban
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Sections of I-10 and I-95, along with numerous state and county
highways, have been closed at times, mostly because of smoke
obscuring the roadways.
</P>
<P>
   However, motorists needn't worry they will suddenly drive into a
wall of fire: Fires near roadways have been reported almost
instantly, and troopers are usually on the scene within minutes,
redirecting traffic if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, the fires are not frightening walls of flame.
Most are knee-high lines of burning brush. Sometimes the flames
reach into the canopies of trees, but more often they stay low,
spreading along the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem for most visitors and residents has been
smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Three Florida counties _ Duval, St. Johns and Volusia _ have
issued warnings advising the elderly, children and people with
heart or respiratory problems to stay indoors, said Bill Parizek of
the state health department.
</P>
<P>
   The smoke has been bad enough to send some tourists packing,
some for health reasons, others out of exasperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awful,'' said Lily Ruegger, of Spartanburg, S.C., who
left Daytona Beach after one night and headed for Hilton Head,
S.C., to complete her family's vacation. ``It's a beautiful beach
but this smoke is so bad I couldn't sleep last night.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Sewell of Demorest, Ga., had the same experience. Her two
grandchildren have asthma, and 4-year-old Macy was awakened in
their motel room with a deep hacking cough after smoke crept
through the air-conditioning unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't blame anybody, it's just happenstance,'' Sewell
said. ``We're going to drive up the coast to Savannah or Myrtle
Beach. We have to get these girls near the ocean. They want to
swim.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, though, weren't bothered by the smoke enough to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be much nicer without it, but it will clear out this
afternoon and it will be just like there's no smoke around,'' said
Jim Overstreet of Lilburn, who was vacationing at Daytona Beach
with his family. ``It blows away and it's no big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Daytona Beach hoteliers rely on the July Fourth weekend as one
of their biggest summer events, and most report they are completely
booked. A few, though, have started getting some cancellations, and
some have noticed a drop-off in walk-in business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just not getting any walk-ins,'' said Chelsea Kim, whose
family owns the Bermuda Villas. ``We've also had a few guests leave
early, but most stay once they see the smoke usually blows away in
the afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean Baxter, manager of the nine-unit Sierra Suites on Daytona
Beach, had one family leave early because of the smoke, and has had
two cancellations. ``It's definitely going to have an impact on our
business unless we get some rain,'' she said. ``But I believe the
die-hard race fans will come anyway, whether they can breathe or
not.''

<P>
   The N.Y. Times said in an editorial, Sunday, June 28:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Until last month, Kashmir seemed just another obscure,
intractable ethnic conflict. But now that India and Pakistan have
tested nuclear weapons, the dispute over their border region of
lush valleys and jagged Himalayan peaks has become a matter of
urgent concern. Three wars have been fought over Kashmir in the
last 50 years. The United States and other countries can help
defuse tensions, but India and Pakistan must make a new attempt to
sort out their differences now that these divisions could become
the pretext for a nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict over Kashmir began with Britain's hasty retreat
from empire, which left India and Pakistan to fight over its
status. That fight has since become an emotional test of principle
and identity. As India's only Muslim state, Jammu and Kashmir, as
it is officially called, has been torn by an insurrection that has
cost 20,000 lives in the last decade and pinned down a major
portion of India's armed forces. This month, guerrillas seeking
independence for the state have ambushed two weddings, leaving more
than two dozen people dead, and blown up a train.
</P>
<P>
   India argues that ceding Kashmir would in effect repudiate its
efforts to forge a multi-ethnic state. Pakistan rejects India's
possession of Kashmir as illegitimate, a freak of history that
resulted because the state's Hindu maharajah chose India at the
time of independence.
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of the dispute, the United States and other
outsiders have backed the United Nations' demand for a plebiscite.
India rejects that approach, and many Muslims in other parts of the
country fear that if Kashmir were somehow lost, they would be
subjected to violent retaliation by Hindus. Most surveys show that
the Kashmiris themselves want independence. But Pakistan, which
controls a chunk of the state on its own, is no more interested in
losing territory to a newly independent country than India is.
</P>
<P>
   In the post-cold-war era, a handful of ethnic conflicts have
been eased by negotiations that could provide an example for
Kashmir. As proposed by independent experts, the first priority
would be to end violence and begin disarming Kashmiri rebels and
Indian forces while Pakistan withdraws its support for the
insurrection. Kashmir should itself move toward more autonomy, if
not outright independence. Ultimately, some political relationship
with both India and Pakistan could be negotiated along the lines of
the recent agreement in Northern Ireland. Another essential
ingredient would be a pullback by Indian and Pakistani forces on
the border, a cease-fire and exchanges of military information
between the two countries. They should aim as well for a freeze of
any plans to deploy nuclear weapons or test missiles that could be
used to deliver them.
</P>
<P>
   These steps would not only assure both countries that they can
resolve their differences peacefully. They would also ease the
world's fear that a remote but savage ethnic and religious conflict
could deteriorate into a nuclear exchange with global consequences.
Russia and China have close ties to India and Pakistan
respectively, and they can join with the United States in helping
to ease tensions. But in the end it is India and Pakistan that must
learn to talk to each other and move toward a more trusting
relationship.

MAJOR ACTIONS OF NEW YORK LEGISLATURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA and RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The 221st session of the New York state
Legislature ground to a close at 6:02 p.m. on June 19, not with the
usual lofty declarations of achievement and unity, but with a
general acknowledgment by lawmakers that in an election year of
partisan attacks and personal animus, many important issues were
left unaddressed.
</P>
<P>
   There were, in essence, two sessions. The first began with
modest agendas but fairly high hopes, and culminated in April along
with the Legislature's budget negotiations, conducted in public for
the first time, and the earliest passage of a budget in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Gov. George Pataki's broad budget vetoes, which kicked
off the second session, one of anger, recrimination and inaction.
</P>
<P>
   Irate lawmakers, primarily Democrats, denied Pataki, a
Republican, nearly all of his agenda for the year, including
restructuring of the court system, tougher criminal-justice laws,
and charter schools. But the Democrats, too, were denied in their
quest for more money for school construction and child care, and
control over changes in the electric power industry.
</P>
<P>
   After a bitter internal fight, the Democrats who control the
Assembly agreed to mandatory reporting of people infected by the
virus that causes AIDS and notification of their partners,
something the Republicans had long sought and the Democrats had
long resisted. And for the second year in a row, a constitutional
amendment to allow casino gambling, supported by Pataki, died in
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In the last days of the session, several bills of broad
importance were agreed on, including inspection of commercial
trucks to reduce air pollution and the creation of an independent
panel to arbitrate policyholders' disputes with health insurers
when they are denied coverage for certain treatments.
</P>
<P>
   In the Assembly, 2,245 bills were introduced, the fewest since
1944, and 1,574 were passed. In the Senate, 1,938 bills were
introduced, also the fewest since 1944, and 1,394 were passed.
</P>
<P>
   Just 671 bills passed both houses, the fewest in at least 88
years. Of those, the governor has signed 111 into law and vetoed
one, and the remaining 559 await his action.
</P>
<P>
   The following were the major actions of the session:
</P>
<P>
   The Budget
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in history, the Senate and Assembly
negotiated much of the state budget publicly, in conference
committees involving dozens of legislators, rather than in secret
meetings among the two legislative leaders and the governor.
</P>
<P>
   A $2 billion surplus, and the relative simplicity of having two
sides to the negotiations rather than three, resulted in passage of
a budget by both houses on April 14, just two weeks after the start
of the fiscal year. Legislators said they were generally pleased by
the process, and hoped it would become the norm.
</P>
<P>
   But Pataki gave lawmakers a rude surprise, vetoing 1,300 items
in the budget, eliminating $760 million in 1998-99 spending and
cutting $840 million in borrowing for projects, many of them in
future years.
</P>
<P>
   He did not veto any of the $743 million a year in tax cuts the
Legislature passed, many of them for business.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats in particular took the vetoes as a declaration of war.
One of the items the governor cut, a $500 million increase in
spending on school construction and repair, was their top priority
for the year. Another program he eliminated, $77 million to raise
the salaries of teachers in urban areas, was a favorite of the
teachers' unions, which are among the Democrats' leading allies. In
the last days of the session, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver sued
the governor, challenging the legality of many of the vetoes.
</P>
<P>
   But even after the vetoes, the budget, at $71.4 billion, was 8.2
percent larger than the previous year's, reflecting the surge in
tax revenue driven by the stock-market boom.
</P>
<P>
   By far the most generous increases were for education, as Pataki
reversed his earlier attempts to cut school spending. The budget
included an $850 million increase in basic school aid, the largest
ever, to more than $11 billion, and a $100 million increase in
school construction spending, to $858 million.
</P>
<P>
   It also included the first year of a $3 billion capital program
for the State University and City University of New York, increases
in operating aid for the two systems, and tuition aid to low-income
college students.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since he took office, Pataki did not try to
make serious cuts in Medicaid, the biggest portion of the budget,
at more than $28 billion.

ROLLER COASTER MISHAP AT NEW JERSEY AMUSEMENT PARK INJURES 13 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By ANDREA KANNAPELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILDWOOD, N.J. _ A roller coaster at a Jersey Shore amusement
park broke an axle Friday night, injuring 13 people who were jarred
when the ride came to an abrupt halt.
</P>
<P>
   The ride's owner, the Morey Organization, said it had called in
outside experts to try to determine what happened. The State
Department of Community Affairs, which is responsible for
inspecting rides, is also investigating the incident, which
occurred at Mariner's Landing, a cluster of rides on a pier along
the boardwalk in the Wildwoods.
</P>
<P>
   The roller coaster, known as the Sea Serpent, backs a chain of
cars up a steep incline and then releases them. The cars zoom down
and then whip around two vertical loops, running out of momentum on
an incline that parallels the first. The cars inch up the remainder
of the incline and are then released to run the course in reverse.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first serious amusement park incident in the region
this year. Safety concerns have grown following a scattering of
incidents, including a drowning at a New Jersey water park and
injuries to two children riding roller coasters at Jersey Shore
parks last summer.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey altered its inspection system earlier this year,
giving responsibility to the Department of Community Affairs. The
state also raised fines for amusement park operators and
established fines for patrons who do not follow operators'
instructions.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred about 9 p.m. Friday after a brief
thunderstorm. The ride was halfway through, with the cars beginning
their reverse run, when the axle broke and the ride screeched to a
halt. Patrons were sitting upright in the cars at the time.
</P>
<P>
   One witness, Louann Zinsmeister of Harrisburg, Pa., said she was
on the pier with her two children. ``There was a loud, loud noise,
like thunder,'' she said. A chunk of the last car flew off, and Ms.
Zinsmeister saw sparks flying as the last car scraped along the
metal track.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven patrons were treated for bumps and bruises at Burdette
Tomlin Memorial Hospital and released; two others were held
overnight for observation. The hospital identified them only as a
19-year-old man in good condition and a 17-year-old girl in fair
condition. Will Morey, the head of the Morey Organization, said
finding out what happened and why was a priority. ``We all put our
families on these rides,'' he said.

HARREL GORDON TILLMAN, 73, FIRST BLACK JUDGE IN TEXAS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Pa., N.C.)   (bl)  
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harrel Gordon Tillman, a Methodist minister who also pursued
careers in acting and broadcasting before he turned to the law and
became the first black judge in Texas, died June 19 at the hospice
of Texas Medical Center in Houston. He was 73 and lived in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was multiple myeloma, said a niece, Jane Tillman
Irving of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Tillman, who practiced law in Houston for some 30 years, was
admitted to the Texas bar in 1962. In 1964 Houston Mayor Louie
Welch named him to the municipal court, making Tillman the first
black judge to sit in Texas at any level. He left the bench in the
late 1960s to attend to his private practice full time.
</P>
<P>
   Tillman had a rich, commanding baritone voice that stood him in
good stead in court, as well as on the pulpit and at the
microphone, on stage and before the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Tillman, a native of Philadelphia, graduated from Livingstone
College in North Carolina. After serving in the Army, he tried his
luck as a repertory stage actor in New York and, in the late '40s,
appeared in several motion pictures produced by blacks with
all-black casts. Among them were ``That Man of Mine,'' in which he
shared top billing with Ruby Dee, and ``Love in Syncopation.''
</P>
<P>
   Deciding that Hollywood was not ready for handsome black
romantic leads, Tillman followed his father's path in the early
'50s and was ordained a minister in the AME Zion Church. He served
as assistant pastor of the Church on the Hill AME Zion in Harlem
until the denomination transferred him to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   He founded Walls Chapel AME there and served as its pastor for
15 years. During that period he was also heard on two local radio
stations, leading a gospel music program and serving as the host of
a talk show.
</P>
<P>
   During his career as a lawyer, Tillman served as general counsel
for the Texas Joint Legislative Committee on Prison Reform, as
director of the Houston Legal Foundation and as a delegate to the
state Democratic Party convention. He ran for Congress,
unsuccessfully, in 1978 and 1982.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his niece, Tillman is survived by two daughters,
Reba Tillman-Huff of Houston and Judith Hickman of Atlanta; a son,
Harrel G. Jr. of Houston; two sisters, Sophie T. Irving and Jerusha
T. McMurray, both of Manhattan; and two grandsons. His marriages to
the former Daisy DeLeon Hannah and Jean LaBrie ended in divorce.

MARY BRECHT, 65; DESIGNED COSTUMES FOR THEATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mary Brecht, who designed costumes for Joseph
Chaikin, Charles Ludlam, Robert Wilson, Richard Foreman and other
prominent directors and writers in the experimental theater, died
June 3 at her summer home in Greenport, N.Y. She was 65 and lived
in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said Phillip Price, her friend and
companion.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the demands of the show, Ms. Brecht's costumes
could be elaborate or threadbare, as if they came directly from a
thrift shop. In both cases, she was imaginative on a minuscule
budget.
</P>
<P>
   For Ludlam and the Ridiculous Theatrical Company, her designs
were fiendish (``Bluebeard''), startlingly hermaphroditic (``The
Grand Tarot'') and lavish (``Camille'').
</P>
<P>
   It was a Mary Brecht gown that Ludlam wore in his satirical,
hairy-chested version of Dumas' tearjerker.
</P>
<P>
   Her most extensive work was with Chaikin and the Open Theater.
She designed more than a dozen of the director's productions,
including ``Endgame,'' ``Waiting for Godot'' ``Tourists and
Refugees,'' ``The Bald Soprano'' and his collaborations with Sam
Shepard: ``Tongues,'' ``Savage Love,'' ``The War in Heaven'' and
``When the World Was Green (A Chef's Fable).''
</P>
<P>
   Together, Chaikin and Ms. Brecht did two versions of Samuel
Beckett's ``Texts for Nothing,'' one in 1981 starring Chaikin, the
other in 1992 starring Bill Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   She also worked with Paul Zimet's Talking Band, a direct
descendant of the Open Theater. In the Talking Band's ``Giaconda
and Si-Ya-U,'' classic paintings like Manet's ``Dejeuner sur
l'herbe'' came to life, with starched collars and frock coats
juxtaposed with nudity.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brecht, who was born in Boston, began her New York career in
1973 with the costumes for Wilson's dusk-to-dawn epic ``The Life
and Times of Joseph Stalin,'' followed by his ``Dollar Value of
Man.''

<P>
   In a review in The New York Times of a 1997 retrospective
exhibition at Public School 1 of the work of Jack Smith, the
filmmaker and performance artist, Holland Cotter said that the
artist's ``heart would have warmed to see how lovingly his costumes
have been refurbished'' by Ms. Brecht. Those costumes included
ornamental brassieres designed for men and a Carmen Miranda-style
gown.

   In addition to Price, she is survived by her husband, Stefan
Brecht (the son of Bertolt Brecht); a daughter, Sarah, and a son,
Sebastian, all of New York City.

RANGERS PICK WELL-ROUNDED ATHLETE FIRST IN NHL DRAFT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ The Rangers' first-round pick Saturday in the
NHL's entry draft, Manny Malhotra, is a 6-foot-1-inch, 210-pound
center who scouts say has skating speed, puckhandling skills and
leadership potential and who can play defense as well as offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wanted to be a leader; I never really try to take
a back seat to anybody,'' Malhotra said. ``It was always a dream to
play in the National Hockey League, just like the big guys on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Right after being named the seventh overall pick in the draft at
Marine Midland Arena here, Malhotra, 18, talked to Ranger fans at
Madison Square Garden by conference call. ``A few thousand fans
there,'' Malhotra said, referring to the Garden. ``I already like
the sound of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Malhotra's background may be as interesting as his hockey
skills. His father is a former table tennis champion from India,
while his mother, a French-Canadian from Quebec, runs a Roman
Catholic prayer ministry from the family home in suburban Toronto.
Both hold doctoral degrees in chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   Their son, who plays for the Guelph Storm of the Ontario Hockey
League, was voted the league's scholastic player of the year last
season. He is bilingual, biracial and seems to exude charisma.
Malhotra's agent is Bobby Orr. Dave Branch, commissioner of junior
hockey in Canada, is one of several hockey authorities who gushed
about Malhotra Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the finest young men I've ever been around,''
Branch said. ``This is a very special young person. Manny is just
an unbelievable kid. He is sensitive and humble. And he is a
big-time hockey player.''
</P>
<P>
   In 57 games with the Storm, Malhotra scored 16 goals and had 35
assists. According to the NHL's Central Scouting Bureau report,
Malhotra ``is not an established scorer'' but is ``always an
offensive force.''
</P>
<P>
   ``An excellent two-way player,'' the report concludes, ``with
excellent work ethics.''
</P>
<P>
   Malhotra's mother, Lise Malhotra, standing at the back of the
news conference where her son was introduced, said she was proud of
the scholastic honors of the youngest of her four children. ``He
always did his studies,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders, choosing ninth on the first round, took Michael
Rupp, a 6-5 left wing from Erie of the Ontario League. Born in
Cleveland, Rupp, 18, is said to be ``a strong skater with good,
straight-ahead speed,'' the central scouting report said. Rupp is
listed as weighing 218 pounds, but he said today: ``I'm pushing
230. I don't think I'm going to get any taller, but I'm going to be
getting bigger. I do have a long way to go, but no reason I can't
handle it. I plan on being a power forward in the NHL someday.'' In
64 games last season, he had 16 goals and 11 assists.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils were scheduled to chose 26th overall later Saturday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had hoped to trade up in the draft for a higher
selection, but were unable to make a deal. After Tampa Bay took
Vincent Lecavalier from Rimouski of the Quebec League with the
first pick, the expansion Nashville Predators traded picks with San
Jose, moving up from third to second.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville took David Legwand, an American-born center from the
Plymouth, Mich., team of the Ontario League. The Sharks took
defenseman David Stuart from Regina of the Western League with the
third pick. After Vancouver, picking fourth, chose defenseman Bryan
Allen of Oshawa in the Ontario League, the Anaheim Mighty Ducks
surprised the gathering by choosing Vitaly Vishnevsky, a defenseman
from Ukraine who played in Russia for Yaroslavl. He was the first
European chosen and was not rated that highly by most North
American observers. When Calgary, picking sixth, took Rico Fata of
the London Knights in the Ontario League, the Rangers had the next
pick and activity suddenly picked up around their table. Neil
Smith, the president and general manager, got on the telephone.
John Muckler, the coach, stood up and began speaking assertively.
While the fans booed, Commissioner Gary Bettman first warned the
Rangers that they were running out of time, then announced a
timeout and charged it to them.
</P>
<P>
   When Smith approached the stage to announce the decision, he
appeared to exchange a few words with Bettman. Rangers spokesman
John Rosasco said that Colorado general manager Pierre Lacroix
tried to get the Rangers to trade their pick but the Rangers
refused. Rosasco said the Rangers wanted to trade with Anaheim and
get the fifth pick because they rated Malhotra that highly and
feared he would be taken before they got their chance.

DONATION TO SCHOOL AT COLUMBIA SETS RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Columbia University's School of Public Health will
announce this week that the Mailman Foundation is giving it $33
million, the largest donation ever to a school of public health.
</P>
<P>
   The school will be named in honor of Joseph L. Mailman, a
founder of Mailman Corp., one of the earliest conglomerates in
North America. He died in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The school, one of 27 schools of public health in the United
States and the only one in New York City, has about 600 students in
master's and doctoral programs, an annual budget of about $50
million and an endowment of about $24 million. It plans to use the
money for faculty salaries, financial aid for students, and
research into areas like AIDS, cancer, women's reproductive health
and health care for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, a relatively small organization consisting of
four family members and no staff, has assets of less than $50
million. The family _ Mailman's widow, Phyllis, and their son,
daughter and grandson _ had been planning to spend $5 million to $6
million, and ended up committing so much because the school seemed
to be a perfect solution after they had considered so many
different projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an extraordinary organization,'' Jody Wolfe, their
daughter, said. ``All these pieces we liked seemed to lead back to
the same School of Public Health.''
</P>
<P>
   The gift is unusual in that neither Mailman nor any member of
his family attended Columbia. Relatives said it was the result of
an unusual search.
</P>
<P>
   As Mrs. Mailman described it, the search began about four years
ago when the family members decided that they wanted something that
would help disadvantaged people in New York, where Mailman had
spent his life. They found that they disagreed about how to focus
their interest _ their ideas were ranging from health care and
clinics to women's issues and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   She finally called the family's lawyer, Bill Josephson at Fried,
Frank, Harris, Shriver &AMP; Jacobson. ``I'm getting older and time is
flying,'' she told him. ``If I don't do this now, it might not
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   He helped put her in touch with Lionel Pincus, a venture
capitalist and vice chairman of Columbia's board of trustees, and
Columbia's vice president for health services, Herbert Pardes.
There was ``immediate rapport,'' Mrs. Mailman recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, however, the right project proved elusive. For a
year, Pardes and his staff suggested various projects, both in the
university and outside it. They all seemed attractive, but nothing
seemed quite right. ``We were about to settle on something,'' Mrs.
Mailman said, ``but we were still not really excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Then one day last fall, Josephson called. ``Are you sitting
down?'' he asked. During a casual conversation, Allan Rosenfield,
the dean of the School of Public Health, had suggested that the
family make a sizable gift to the school itself.
</P>
<P>
   The family was especially pleased that the school combined
public policy with hands-on treatment of people, that it was aimed
at preventing disease across whole communities, and that it
operated family health clinics in Harlem, a breast-cancer study on
Long Island, and efforts to prevent pregnancy and smoking among
teen-agers and to study health problems of refugees.

L.A. COURTING DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION FOR 2000
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- When 54 high-level Democrats come to Los Angeles
next month, they will be given a bird's-eye view of what local
officials say is the metropolis of the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter ride is just part of a celebrity-studded,
whirlwind trip around Los Angeles -- a critical step in the city's
high-stakes bid to host the Democratic National Convention in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential nomination party is politics' biggest prize, a
windfall that will give the host city unparalleled hype with the
invasion of 15,000 journalists and pump more than $137 million into
the local economy.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles is facing stiff competition from six other cities,
including Boston, which hosted the convention's Site Selection
Committee for three days last week.
</P>
<P>
   Boston pulled out all the stops: Mayor Thomas Menino served a
lobster dinner, arranged an indoor fireworks show and took
committee members to a Red Sox game -- where hockey great Bobby Orr
served the drinks.
</P>
<P>
   So how is Los Angeles going to top that?
</P>
<P>
   Cocktails at Mayor Richard Riordan's private Brentwood home,
followed by dinner at the Getty Center. Hollywood limo tours. A
virtual visit to the $300 million Staples Center, which is set to
open in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   And if that's not enough, a reminder that California represents
54 electoral votes. That's more than any other state and a bloc
that all but ensures that whoever wins California goes to the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``That shouldn't be ruled out,'' said Roz Wyman, a member of the
Site Selection Committee since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Riordan pulled the city from consideration for
the party conventions because Los Angeles was consumed with
rebuilding itself from the Northridge Earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Riordan said, the city is ready, adding, ``Los Angeles has
turned around and we have a lot to be proud of and a lot to show
off.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Staples Center, the new downtown cathedral
will be near completion and work is expected to be under way on the
Disney Center performance hall.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic delegation's three-day visit will begin with VIP
treatment at Los Angeles International Airport. Members will be
whisked to luxurious rooms at the Biltmore Hotel downtown, where
they will find summer survival kits -- sunglasses, suntan lotion,
caps and other gear to help them manage their Los Angeles stay.
</P>
<P>
   Top city, county, state and federal officials will bend their
ears, and the host committee is trying to lure some big-name
Hollywood stars to help sell the city's assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have the glitz,'' Wyman said. ``You have to sell
your city. And you have to realize a lot of the Democratic
delegates aren't rich and many have to use their vacation time to
come, so they are looking for other attractions.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Wyman, a former Los Angeles councilwoman, serves as a
member of the Site Selection Committee, she has made no secret of
her desire to see the next convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles' host committee -- chaired by businessman Eli Broad
with help from David Geffen of DreamWorks SKG and a laundry list of
the city's movers and shakers -- will promote the city's major
attractions, including Olvera Street and Universal Studios.
</P>
<P>
   Broad said his appeal to Democratic leaders has been a practical
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last nine elections, Republicans have won six times,''
Broad said. ``The three won by Democrats were when Democrats
carried California. Fifty-four electoral votes mean a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   His second argument is equally basic: money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles and New York are the two most important cities for
donations to the party,'' Broad said. ``But a lot of us are getting
older. If the party wants to attract new donors, they have to come
out to meet with them.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Broad said a convention in Los Angeles would draw
more viewers in Southern California because local television
stations would be focusing on the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Broad's committee will coordinate all the activities, with the
pledge to raise $27 million for the various costs involved in
preparing and submitting a bid.
</P>
<P>
   That money is viewed as an investment designed to bring in $137
million for the city and help set its image for the years to come.
</P>
<P>
   When the delegation arrives next month, the city built on
make-believe will be asking representatives to use their
imaginations to picture Los Angeles as the city of the millennium,
the metropolis that should serve as host of the party's national
convention in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Host committee members will be talking up what will be one of
the nation's newest convention halls, the Staples Center. The
center, being built as the new home of the Los Angeles Lakers,
Kings and Clippers, is scheduled to open for the 1999 season, and
officials are confident it will meet its time line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem is we have to show them we can put on a
convention in a building that isn't built,'' Wyman said. ``Staples
Center will be built, but it's not so easy showing them a model
rather than the building.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Boston, competing cities include Houston,
Philadelphia, Miami, New Orleans and Detroit.

HOTEL PROPOSAL LIFTS OCEANSIDE'S SAGGING IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By KEVIN BRASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OCEANSIDE, Calif. _ A proposal to build a 475-room hotel and
conference center on the waterfront is generating new interest in
this city's long-dormant hotel market.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 miles north of San Diego Bay, Oceanside is home to a
1,900-foot wooden pier, wide sandy beaches and a manmade harbor. It
is also neighbor to the country's largest Marine base, Camp
Pendleton.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 1,078 guest rooms here are motor courts catering to
military families and travelers on Route 101, which intersects
Interstate 5, the main artery between San Diego and Los Angeles, at
the northern boundary of the city and the Marine base.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has the perception of being a rough town,'' said Robert
Miller, a lodging industry specialist with Grubb &AMP; Ellis, the
national commercial brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Oceanside entered into an exclusive development
deal with the San Diego-based Manchester Resorts to build the hotel
and conference complex on 11.44 acres next to the city's pier. The
city owns about half the land, and Manchester is already in escrow
to buy most of the rest, contingent on the project's going forward.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for twin 12-story towers. A third tower would contain
100 apartments to be sold as time shares, which allow people to buy
a small share of a unit to be used on specific dates. The
developers have until Sept. 4 to negotiate final details with the
city, which is offering incentives such as street closures and help
in developing parking spaces and is working out special financing
inducements. The developers also want to use land the city owns to
build a new golf course a few miles from the pier site.
</P>
<P>
   Although some residents are protesting several issues, including
plans to move a city amphitheater to accommodate the new resort's
swimming pool, negotiations are moving forward in a ``positive and
expeditious manner,'' said Thomas Wilson, Oceanside's City Manager.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, a group of investors proposed 300 time-share units for
the property. The concept was approved by the California Coastal
Commission in 1992, but the units were never built.
</P>
<P>
   Later efforts to build a hotel also failed, and a portion of the
land fell into a bankruptcy proceeding. ``Financing just dried up
in the early 90s for hotels in southern California,'' said James
Watkins, one of the original partners in the unsuccessful
time-share project. ``Hotels were in real trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   While the rest of San Diego County has rebounded, Oceanside has
seen little hotel activity in the coastal downtown area. Average
room rates hover in the $55-a-night range, while other coastal
areas are getting more than $100.
</P>
<P>
   The lone hotel property directly on the city's 1,000-foot
marina, the 64-unit Oceanside Marina Inn, fell into disrepair and
bankruptcy in the 80s. In 1994, the city, which owns the land, paid
$1.1 million to buy back the lease, which was due to run out in
2036.
</P>
<P>
   The city hired a management company to operate the hotel while
it spent more than $100,000 to put a new roof on the building and
repair and renovate rooms. In 1997, it signed a 10-year lease with
Radelow, Gittens Real Estate Management, a private company, to
operate the property.
</P>
<P>
   According to Larry Gittens, a partner in the management company,
the Marina Inn's occupancy rate has risen to 77 percent from 58
percent in 1994, thanks in part to a marketing campaign targeting
vacationers from inland California and Arizona. Room rates are now
about $95 a night after years in the $50 range, he said.
</P>
<P>
   To counter its image problem, Oceanside has begun a
redevelopment effort. Several buildings have been remodeled, the
pier was restored and the California Surf Museum moved into new
quarters there. The city also moved a railroad switchyard that
adjacent to the proposed hotel site. ``There was little interest in
a hotel site next to a rail switching yard,'' said Eli Sanchez, the
city's redevelopment director.

<P>
   Despite the improvements and an overall drop in crime, the value
of lodging properties in the downtown area continues to lag the
rest of the county.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, a group of local investors paid $2.25 million
for the 82-room Bridge Motor Inn, with a restaurant, overlooking
the harbor. The property had been in bankruptcy and badly in need
of renovation. The price translates to about $27,000 a room,
compared with the $75,000 often paid for properties near San
Diego's waterfront. ``Once we have more quality rooms, people will
stay in Oceanside,'' said Dr. Shantu Patel, one of the partners.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Patel and his wife, Mona, bought another 82-room inn
near the water for $1.6 million. They renovated the facility and
affiliated it with the Days Inn chain. ``Oceanside has changed for
the positive,'' Patel said. ``At one time, Oceanside was recognized
as a Marine town, but now more people are recognizing it as a beach
town.''
</P>
<P>
   To many investors, Oceanside still suffers from a stigma, said
Robert Rauch, managing director of Interbank Brener Hospitality, a
New York-based consulting company. Last year, Rauch paid $2 million
for a 50-room motel with few amenities away from the waterfront in
Leucadia, a few minutes' drive south of Oceanside.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the proposed hotel and conference center, Rauch
said: ``The Manchester property is going to have to be the driver
of change in Oceanside. I don't know who else would want to take
the risk, given the high quality of the other submarkets in the
county.''
</P>
<P>
   The Manchester project would face competition from several new
resort properties in the county, including new hotels operated by
Four Seasons and Hyatt in Carlsbad and La Jolla, respectively, both
within a 20-minute drive of this city.
</P>
<P>
   The number of hotels in the county almost doubled in the 80s.
Although occupancy rates plummeted to 63 percent in 1993, overall
occupancy now averages a healthy 76 percent, according to PKF
Consulting of Los Angeles, a lodging specialist.
</P>
<P>
   In the northern part of San Diego, hotels have been able to
build a strong corporate business, fueled by the growth in the
biotechnology and communications industries. The average occupancy
rate in the north coast area of San Diego County last year was 87
percent, and the average room rate rose more than 10 percent,
according to PKF Consulting's research.
</P>
<P>
   To survive in southern California outside the major tourist
areas hotels ``have to be within three or five miles of a
significant corporate demand generator,'' said Richard Swig,
president of RSBA &AMP; Associates, a hotel consulting concern in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Oceanside has neither a strong corporate base nor ``distinctive
shopping or a cute factor,'' Swig said.
</P>
<P>
   Manchester Resorts believe it can attract conference business to
Oceanside. Its project includes 26,000 square feet of meeting
space. The off-site golf course is part of the plan to attract
business travelers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're confident we can reach that group market,'' said Richard
Gibbons, chief executive officer of Manchester Resorts. The company
developed the Hyatt Regency and the San Diego Marriott Hotel and
Marina on San Diego Bay. If the project is built correctly, it will
be able to attract steady business by inserting itself into the
rotation of annual events from hotel to hotel, Gibbons said.
</P>
<P>
   Official releases for the pier project refer to a
``Hyatt-quality'' hotel and news reports often suggest Hyatt's
involvement, but Hyatt is still not committed to the project. A
spokeswoman declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to lure bigger chains, the city is launching a new
marketing program targeting hotel operators and investment groups.
``If Manchester is able to build the hotel, I think Oceanside will
change,'' said Miller, the lodging specialist. ``They need
something to improve what people think of Oceanside.''

COMMENTARY: IN LEVITTOWN, CANCER STEALS PEACE OF MIND 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JANE GROSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEVITTOWN , N.Y. _ At a kitchen table at 99 Meridian Rd., three
women hunch over a map of their town, best known as a synonym for
suburban tract housing. They mark the streets with red dots, each
one representing a case of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Within sight of No. 99, the home of Hariett Haake, who has
uterine cancer, the women know of four cases of breast cancer and
one each of cervical and brain cancer. On the cross street, Solar
Lane, there are three more neighbors with breast cancer. Within the
northwest quadrant of Levittown, there are 26 red dots.
</P>
<P>
   ``And those are only the people we know,'' said Carol Kopf, the
only healthy woman of the three, who has been keeping an unofficial
tally for years, ever since her children seemed to be going to too
many funerals _ for their friends' parents or their coaches' wives.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you rang any doorbell, they might find another one,'' Mrs.
Kopf said. ``I hear my next-door neighbor ....'' She breaks off in
midthought. ``But we only talk about flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   Beth Wall, a 36-year-old mother of five who has breast cancer,
grabs the telephone to call a friend who is a repository of
neighborhood history. Listening, Mrs. Wall's jaw drops. It seems
the prior owners of Mrs. Haake's house both had cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did I ever come here?'' Mrs. Haake wails, weakly. She is
54 and wearing a nightgown printed with teddy bears. Recently, she
learned that she had exhausted all treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The scientific community is all but unanimous in discounting the
notion that cancer clusters can be traced to environmental factors.
But grave illness is not merely about science. It is about fear.
And about a deep longing to impose order on chaos, to have a reason
for this unreasonable turn of events.
</P>
<P>
   In Levittown, a ghastly kind of order emerged in mid-June, with
the report of 15 cases of cancer, and eight deaths, in the 50 homes
on Ramble Lane. Since then, residents all over town have been
reporting their own worrisome findings. On Normal Lane, in two
adjacent houses, couples died of breast and pancreatic cancer. On
Bud Lane, the next street over, there have been three breast-cancer
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   All of this could be mere coincidence. But since the Ramble Lane
report, in mid-June, state and county politicians have acted, some
say in an election-year nod to nervous constituents. A survey
designed for the county and state by the breast-cancer advocacy
group One in Nine will be mailed next week to all 17,544 homes in
the 11756 zip code.
</P>
<P>
   Data from that survey will be used to map the incidence of
disease here, then overlaid with locations of known and potential
carcinogens. The next town to be mapped is Rockville Centre, then
the rest of Nassau County and eventually the entire state, the New
York State Health Department said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to find out what we're sitting on and eating and
breathing,'' said Geri Barish, head of One in Nine, who lost a son
to Hodgkin's disease and has breast cancer. She lives in Baldwin,
in a house where the last two owners had cancer, too.
</P>
<P>
   In Rockville Centre, Colette Cohen's doctor compares her
breast-cancer diagnosis to buying a new car and suddenly seeing the
same model all over the road. But the women at Harriet Haake's
kitchen table believe otherwise. Yes, they are more aware of
illness. But they are also persuaded there is something in the
water or the air.
</P>
<P>
   This town was once a vast potato field, sprayed with DDT. There
is a Superfund site a mile or so north, where Grumman aircraft used
to be. And there is a pungent plastics factory nearby.
</P>
<P>
   All of these factors or none of them could matter, the women
acknowledge. It may be just as bad on Cape Cod or in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   But the place you live is supposed to comfort and protect you.
Believing otherwise, whatever the scientists say, challenges the
rightful order of things. Mrs. Haake, Mrs. Wall and Mrs. Kopf were
all asked what came to mind when they heard the word ``home.'' They
replied in unison, with one word, as if on cue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Safety,'' the three women said, and then fell into a troubled
silence.

FORMER PRISON GUARD IS GOING BACK AS INMATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DANNEMORA, N.Y. _ The rules that will govern Darrel Harris' life
on death row are dizzying in their detail. Awaiting his execution
at Clinton Correctional Facility here, Harris will be allowed to
read the Bible, smoke cigars and wash his hands with a 1-ounce bar
of soap. He will not be allowed to wear his own clothes, chew gum
or play a musical instrument.
</P>
<P>
   Harris' death sentence, which jurors in his murder trial voted
for earlier this month, sent prison officials scurrying to dust off
dozens of regulations drawn up three years ago, shortly after Gov.
George Pataki reinstated the death penalty in New York.
</P>
<P>
   With Harris scheduled to arrive at Clinton after his official
sentencing on July 21, they are also putting the finishing touches
on death row itself, a block of 12 cells in a building that houses
criminals with the most severe disciplinary problems.
</P>
<P>
   As they bring death row back to life, prison officials admit
that they are feeling their way. New York has not had a condemned
inmate since 1984, when the state's highest court declared the
remaining provision of the death penalty law in effect at the time
unconstitutional. It has not put a prisoner to death since 1963,
when Eddie Lee Mays went to the electric chair in Sing Sing for
killing a woman as he robbed a bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a learning experience for everybody,'' said
William Burke, an assistant deputy superintendent who is helping
prepare for Harris' arrival. ``A lot of things will have to be
decided after we get under way.''
</P>
<P>
   New York prison officials visited Texas and several other states
to study their systems of capital punishment soon after Pataki
signed the new death penalty law, which specified execution by
lethal injection. The research helped them develop disciplinary
policies for condemned prisoners and a step-by-step instruction
manual for executions, outlining everything from the number of
witnesses to the exact mix of drugs required.
</P>
<P>
   They chose Clinton, a maximum-security prison in the
northernmost corner of the state, as the site of death row because
it has a separate building for the most troublesome inmates. There,
each of the 12 cells on death row is divided into two rooms. Three
of the cells have been renovated so that the rear room has a
shower, a visiting area and a door that opens onto a small
recreation yard, so condemned prisoners have almost no reason to
leave their cells.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials have decided that Harris will have no contact
with the nearly 2,000 other inmates at Clinton, most of whom have
been convicted of drug offenses or violent crimes. Troublesome
inmates will still be housed in the remaining 36 cells in the
separate building, but on death row, Harris will be unable to see
them.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, 40, is a former prison guard in a New York City jail who
won a medal in 1987 for showing heroism during a 1986 inmate
uprising. Jim Flateau, a spokesman for the State Department of
Correctional Services, said Harris' knowledge of the prison system
made him especially dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a former corrections officer who is very well aware of
procedures, operations and the kinds of scams that inmates will try
to accomplish,'' Flateau said. ``He knows the system far better
than 99.9 percent of the offenders anywhere in the country. And
remember, you're talking about someone who has nothing to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeals process will almost certainly delay Harris'
execution for years, and could even reduce his sentence. But the
execution chamber, 200 miles south of Clinton at Green Haven
Correctional Facility in Dutchess County, is ready at a moment's
notice. Prison officials decided not to put the chamber at Clinton
because ``to have the death house and the actual execution occur
elsewhere helps to keep stress levels down,'' Flateau said.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials spelled out how they would put inmates to death
in an 11-page memorandum in 1995. It lists the drugs to be injected
into the prisoner's arms: sodium pentothal, which causes
unconsciousness; Pavulon, which stops respiration, and potassium
chloride, which stops the heart. But Flateau said prison officials
would not choose or train technicians for the ``injection team''
until an execution is imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It serves no purpose to do it right now,'' he said, ``because
we all know that realistically, it's going to be awhile.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris was convicted May 19 of first-degree murder for killing
three people as he robbed a Brooklyn social club in 1996. He
remains in jail at Rikers Island until he is transported upstate.
His lawyers, some of whom work for a state agency created to defend
death row inmates, are already preparing his appeals.
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn district attorney's office in New York City would
challenge an appeal of the conviction, but the state attorney
general's office would handle any appeal challenging the
constitutionality of the death sentence. That office has assigned
an assistant attorney general, Diane LaVallee, a former prosecutor
in Erie County, to fight Harris' appeals full time.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Dennis Vacco hired Ms. LaVallee two years ago
to lead the Capital Assistance for Prosecutors Team, which helps
county prosecutors try death penalty cases. But she has never
handled an appeal from a condemned prisoner, said Chris McKenna, a
spokesman for Vacco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has that kind of experience here, really,'' McKenna
said. ``But we have spoken to other states about it.''
</P>
<P>
   McKenna said Vacco chose not to hire lawyers with expertise in
death penalty appeals because it would be costly, and because New
York's law was intended to prevent lengthy appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Academia claims that you're going to have all these high
expenses from death penalty cases,'' McKenna said. ``But it's never
been shown. I don't know where these bloated $2 (million) or $3
million figures always come from. We have these people on staff who
are being paid whether they are doing death penalty cases or
parking-ticket cases.''
</P>
<P>
   But with three new capital cases coming to trial around the
state this summer, the costs for such cases could soon rise, as
they require more preparation than noncapital cases. The trial of
Dalkeith Williams, accused of fatally shooting his estranged wife
and her daughter in 1996 as they sat in a parked car, began this
month in Poughkeepsie. And two other capital trials are expected to
begin soon in Brooklyn and on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Correctional Services has spent $25,000 to
outfit three of the 12 cells on death row with showers and visiting
areas, and $2,500 to remove the electric chair from Green Haven and
replace it with lethal-injection equipment. The state will
eventually spend $350,000 to renovate all 48 of the cells in the
building that houses death row, improve the ventilation system and
install security cameras to monitor inmates, Flateau said.
</P>
<P>
   The state has spent $190,000 renovating the third floor of the
old hospital building at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility in
Westchester County to serve as death row for women. Three cells are
ready for use.
</P>
<P>
   Five prison guards will be assigned to watch Harris, one at a
time, in eight-hour shifts at a desk near his cell. If more than
five guards apply for the job, it will go to the men with the most
seniority. If none apply, the most recently hired guards will be
tapped, Flateau said.
</P>
<P>
   A guard supervising a cell block at Clinton this week, who would
not give his name, said nobody wanted to spend his days watching
the only condemned man in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a high-profile job, with cameras all over the place,'' he
said. ``Those guys are going to be scrutinized like crazy. No
thanks.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a day, a guard will escort Harris to the courtyard outside
his cell, where he can exercise for an hour unless it is snowing or
raining hard. He can take a small television set for his cell, but
it must be black and white. There is a window across from his cell;
it looks out on a fence topped with razor wire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he can see a patch of sky,'' said Burke, the deputy
superintendent. ``Nothing more.''

YANKEES 7, METS 2
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The event known as the Subway Series is becoming
something of a bust, like so many Super Bowls. It was supposed to
be competitive, it was supposed to be rollicking, it was supposed
to be something to remember. Instead, the Yankees are routing their
crosstown rivals, and the Mets are presenting little resistance.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Mets aided and abetted the Yankees on Saturday,
committing numerous defensive mistakes in an embarrassing 7-2 loss
before 53,587 fans at Shea Stadium. The Yankees will go for a
three-game sweep Sunday night, with Orlando Hernandez pitching
against Masato Yoshii, the Mets pitcher who has an 8.04 earned run
average in his last four starts.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez, held out of the starting lineup in Friday's
come-from-behind win, hit a three-run homer and started another
Yankee rally with a double, helping pitcher Andy Pettitte improve
his record to 9-5. The Yankees are 9 for 16 with runners in scoring
position in this series, the Mets 2 for 12.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' record is now 55-19, the second-best record after
74 games in their storied history; the 1928 Yankees started 56-18.
</P>
<P>
   With their anemic offense, the Mets must pitch and catch well to
win. They do not often generate enough runs to overcome mistakes,
and they cannot afford to give away runs.
</P>
<P>
   They did that in the second inning when, with one out and the
left-handed-hitting Paul O'Neill coming to bat, the infield
shifted, with Rey Ordonez moving toward second so that he was
playing almost directly up the middle. When O'Neill hit a roller a
few feet to the first base side of second, Ordonez was perfectly
positioned, scooping the ball and throwing to first, head high.
</P>
<P>
   John Olerud, his hands as good as anyone's in the league,
reached up to take the throw _ and the ball hit the webbing of his
glove and bounced away. Quite simply, he dropped the throw.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill took a lead off first, with Olerud holding him there and
Darryl Strawberry at the plate. For weeks, Strawberry had looked
forward to this series, to playing in his former kingdom, and this
was his first chance. Trying to send a ball into orbit, Strawberry
swung twice with malicious intent. After the second big swing,
Strawberry held a palm down, a warning meant only for himself: calm
down.
</P>
<P>
   Adjusting to a curveball, he slowed down his swing and pulled a
grounder through the right side, past Olerud, with O'Neill turning
at second and rambling into third. Even if you believe that Mets'
starter Bobby Jones would have pitched Strawberry the same way
whether there were runners on base or not, there is this: If Olerud
had not dropped the throw, putting O'Neill on first, he would have
been in position to field Strawberry's grounder and the inning
would have been over.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Yankees had two runners on and Martinez at the
plate. Jones threw a curveball to the Yankees' first baseman, it
hung, and Martinez lifted a line drive that barely cleared the
eight-foot fence in right field and landed in the Mets' bullpen.
Whether Yankees fans made up 20 percent of the crowd or 50 percent,
they made 100 percent of the noise at that moment.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets played listlessly and without much energy the rest of
the way. And adding to their misery was the news that Al Leiter,
the team's best pitcher, will miss at least six weeks and perhaps
more with a knee injury suffered in Friday night's loss.

VENTURE INTO NEW YORK REAL ESTATE MARKET WITH CAUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is hardly news that the real estate market in the
New York City area is about as hot as it has been in quite a while.
And since the heat seems to be generated by the friction from
buyers bumping into one another chasing sellers, there has hardly
been a more appropriate time to apply the first rule of the open
market: ``Let the buyer beware.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People do strange things when they're under pressure,'' said
William Selsberg, a real estate lawyer in Stamford, Conn., noting
that buyers who are anxious about losing the house of their dreams
had a tendency to become careless with what might be the most
significant investment of a lifetime. ``And if you're careless,
you're probably going to get kicked.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Selsberg said, some clients have suggested in
recent months that they would be willing to waive one or more of
the common contingencies inserted into a contract of sale _ things
like home inspections, and requirements that a mortgage must be
obtained and that an existing home must be sold before the buyer is
required to complete the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them that waiving things like that can end up costing
them a fortune,'' Selsberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Waiving a home-sale contingency, for example, might seem safe
when a person buying a new home already has a signed contract to
sell the current one. Many people reason, Selsberg said, that if
the sale of their existing home falls through, they will be able to
safely exit from the contract for the purchase of the new one
because mortgage commitments themselves are generally contingent
upon the sale of an existing home.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not necessarily the case, Selsberg said, because it
can be argued quite convincingly that the mortgage contingency
clause in the buyer's contract to purchase the new home was fully
satisfied when the mortgage commitment was issued, even though the
commitment was contingent upon the sale of the buyer's existing
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``That contingency is between the buyer and his lender,''
Selsberg said. ``As far as the seller is concerned, the mortgage
contingency has been met and the buyer has to go through with the
deal or lose his deposit.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Selsberg said, he has a stock answer for clients
who suggest waiving a standard contingency: ``Don't you dare do
that,'' he tells them. ``You can never skip a step.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one of the more common steps that buyers seem willing
to skip is the home inspection. And that can have costly
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think that if they insist on a home inspection, someone
will come and steal the house out from under them,'' said Maryann
Murphy, director of Housemaster, a nationwide home inspection
company based in Bound Brook, N.J. But an inspection by a qualified
inspector, Ms. Murphy said, can uncover problems that even
knowledgeable buyers might miss, things like water seepage, the
presence of asbestos, radon gas or lead paint or a leaking
underground oil storage tank.
</P>
<P>
   And while such problems cost a buyer money only when they are
successful in purchasing the house, there are some risks that can
occur when they are unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   As the number of available apartments decreases, particularly in
Manhattan, ``the waiving of mortgage contingencies by apartment
buyers has suddenly emerged as a widespread practice in New York
City,'' said Gordon Shanks, managing director of Home Mortgage
Acceptance Corporation, a Manhattan-based mortgage broker. ``They
know that if they don't win the bidding the first time, it might be
months before they find another apartment.''
</P>
<P>
   But waiving the mortgage contingency is generally considered
risky because the deposit can be lost if a mortgage cannot be
obtained and the buyer can't go through with the deal. But it is
possible to eliminate that risk, Shanks said, if a buyer can get a
mortgage commitment before entering into a contract of sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``These buyers apply for a mortgage and get a commitment letter
before they actually find the apartment they want to buy,'' Shanks
said. ``When they find an apartment, they can bid on it immediately
and waive the mortgage contingency.''
</P>
<P>
   Neil Bader, president of Skyscraper Mortgage in Manhattan, said
that while a buyer with a commitment in hand might safely waive a
mortgage contingency, those who have only been ``prequalified'' or
``pre-approved'' should proceed with caution.
</P>
<P>
   Prequalification, Bader said, is merely an indication that a
lender is likely to grant a mortgage. That, however, is based only
upon the information provided by the prospective borrower.
Generally, he said, prequalifications do not take into
consideration significant factors like credit history, employment
history, and the special scrutiny given to income generated by
self-employment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prequalification certainly isn't enough for a buyer to safely
waive a mortgage contingency,'' Bader said.
</P>
<P>
   Pre-approval, on the other hand, does provide some measure of
assurance because most factors are accounted for. But the problem
with pre-approval is that it doesn't take into consideration one
factor of great significance to a lender _ the appraised value of
the property.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the appraisal comes in too low, the mortgage will probably
not be approved,'' said Bader, noting that the buyer would be
paying more than the lender believed the property was worth. And
that, he said, can result in the loss of the buyer's deposit if
there is no mortgage contingency clause to provide an escape route.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Saatchi, an agent with Dayton-Halstead Real Estate in East
Hampton, N.Y., said that property owners there were addressing that
issue by agreeing to share the risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buyers are waiving the mortgage contingency only if sellers
will guarantee the appraisal value,'' said Ms. Saatchi. ``If the
appraisal comes in too low, the buyer's lack of a mortgage
contingency doesn't matter because the seller's guarantee gives him
another out.''
</P>
<P>
   But how likely is a low appraisal?
</P>
<P>
   ``Very likely,'' said Peter Bell, chief executive of Balch
Buyers Realty, an exclusive buyer-broker in Mamaroneck, N.Y.
``There's such tremendous competition for listings now that if a
seller wants to list his house for $50,000 more than it's worth, a
broker might take the listing anyway because he knows that if he
doesn't take it, another broker will.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, Bell said, coupled with low interest rates, high
salaries, dual incomes and generous bonuses can result in purchase
prices being driven upward by what buyers can afford to pay today,
rather than what the real value of the property would be in a less
robust economy.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Davis, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the late 80s, people buying real estate believed that the
good times would last forever and that the market would never stop
expanding,'' he said. ``But the market contracted, and people lost
their jobs or had to move, and some of them couldn't even sell
their apartments for the outstanding balance on their mortgage.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Davis said, buyers whose dream home is appraised
for less than what they are about to pay for it should take a deep
breath and contemplate whether the low appraisal is a blessing in
disguise.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get intoxicated with a particular piece of real
estate, you tend to make decisions that are emotional rather than
reasonable,'' he said. ``And buying real estate should always be a
function of sobriety.''

BUILDINGS WITHOUT DOORMEN UPGRADING SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOYCE COHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ First there were homeless people sleeping in the
vestibule. Then there was a mugging. And so the residents at 309 W.
104th St., a co-op without doormen, decided to beef up security.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago they locked the outside vestibule door as well as
the inside door, installing a buzzer on each so that visitors must
ring twice to get in. And they removed residents' names from the
outside directory, making it impossible to tell who lives in what
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Sarah Conly has to explain to visitors that they must buzz
again to get through the inside door. She has to make sure they
know her apartment number. Sometimes she just sends her children
down to the lobby to wait for guests. ``I feel it has made the
building safer,'' she said. ``It makes it twice as hard to get
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the city, nondoorman buildings are upgrading their
security. No one keeps statistics, but security experts say that
changes have become increasingly common, especially over the last
three years.
</P>
<P>
   The most widespread measures are relatively simple, like the
ones taken at 309 W. 104th St. _ locking the outer door and
eliminating names from the directory or using numbers instead of
apartment designations.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a rise in the use of video surveillance systems,
especially those connected to residents' television sets.
</P>
<P>
   Doorman buildings, many of which already have monitors at the
entrance, are upgrading, too. But the most recent change for those
buildings is decidedly low-tech: locking the front door at night.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the city's lower crime rates, people are more
security-conscious than ever. Improvements have ``gone on and on
for the 35 years I've lived in New York,'' said Robert McCrie, head
of the security management program at John Jay College of Criminal
Justice.
</P>
<P>
   In nondoorman rental buildings, good security is important as a
selling point, he said. What's more, said McCrie, ``there is a
long-term trend of growing liability on the part of the building
owner, operator and manager; landlords know they have a legal
obligation to make the building secure.''
</P>
<P>
   As for co-ops and condominiums, ``there's a greater sense of
propriety,'' he continued. ``They make decisions on their own
well-being, and security is invariably a topic.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes improvements are made when a building converts, he
said, but often the buildings ``take care of the cosmetic work
first and turn to security sometime later.''
</P>
<P>
   For many buildings that went co-op in the late '70s and early
'80s, later is now. ``These people have gotten their co-ops in very
good financial shape,'' said Matthew Arnold, president of Academy
Mailbox &AMP; Intercom Co. in College Point, Queens. ``Their bills are
paid and they're spending money for upgrades. What they're doing
today is above and beyond the minimum.'' (The minimum, according to
the state's Multiple Dwelling Law, is a locked door and, in
buildings with eight units or more, an intercom with a door
release.)
</P>
<P>
   Over the last five years, Arnold said, requests to relocate
locks and intercoms have risen from one or two a month to one or
two a week.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the domino effect: ``They see other buildings
(heightening security) and think it's a good idea,'' said Al Simon,
president of Nortronics, a security company in Palisades Park, N.J.
``Or they need to fix something and they say, `Let's put in a new
one while we're at it, better than before.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, of course, there's a catalyst. The man they call the
``East Side rapist,'' on the loose since 1994, may have much to do
with security upgrades on the Upper East Side. In most of his 16
attacks, the rapist has sneaked up on his victims after they had
gone through an unlocked outer door. In the wake of these attacks,
the 19th Police Precinct recommends locking the building's outer
door, which prevents people from lurking in the vestibule and keeps
tenants more visible from the street.
</P>
<P>
   Following the recommendation seems to be working. ``We have had
almost no incidents'' in buildings where outside locks have been
added, said Ira Meister, chief operating officer of Elm Management
Associates, which manages more than a dozen nondoorman buildings in
Manhattan. ``We have had no claims in the past two years.'' Before
that, he said, ``there were break-in-type situations.''
</P>
<P>
   He has also found that, in big buildings, video surveillance has
reduced thefts by employees. (Security experts note that signs
announcing a building is under video surveillance, even when it
isn't, are effective.)
</P>
<P>
   And residents at 309 W. 104th St. report an unexpected side
effect of their two locked doors _ far fewer take-out menus under
their apartment doors. Still, the need to ring twice confuses
people, said Ms. Conly.
</P>
<P>
   It confuses them so much, in fact, that some security companies
post instructional signs on their outside intercom panels. ``Ring
apartment from inside panel after admittance,'' reads the sign from
Gorilla Security Systems in Mineola, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of variations on the locked-outer-door system.
Some buildings add a wrought-iron gate and perch the buzzer there.
Others simply move the lock from the inside to the outside, keeping
only one door locked. Sometimes visitors have to ring just once to
get through two locked doors: Residents can buzz them in through
the outer door, wait a few seconds, and buzz again to release the
inner door.
</P>
<P>
   Other systems have a time delay, where one buzz unlocks an outer
door and then, some seconds later, unlocks an inner door. Simon, of
Nortronics, disapproves of those. ``What's the point of having two
locks,'' he said, ``if someone comes through the outer door and can
breeze right through the inner door?''
</P>
<P>
   Another danger, of course, is that an intruder will buzz at
random until a resident lets him in.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the small rectangular plate that's near almost
every intercom panel? That's the key keeper, and it's there for
postal purposes. The letter carrier has a master key that opens the
key keeper for every building in the ZIP code; inside is the
building's front-door key, usually on a retractable cord. The
master key also opens the bank of mailboxes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Relocating hardware to an outer door requires new wiring for
each apartment, which costs about $30 a unit, though prices vary
according to the building's size and the hardware. In a new
building, installing the hardware from scratch costs $100 to $150
per unit.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, higher-tech security systems, such as those that use
video cameras, are much more costly. But one big advantage is they
can record what they see, so there is a log of who has come and
gone.
</P>
<P>
   Closed-circuit television allows a building have a kind of
in-house security channel. With a camera aimed at the front door
and sometimes other places like the elevator and the laundry room,
residents can tune in and see what's going on. Such a system would
cost a total of $1,000 to $1,500 in a 12-unit brownstone _ more if
some residents of the building don't have cable, according to Kevin
Cogan of Alert 1 Alarm Systems in Manhattan, which installs the
equipment for Time Warner Cable.
</P>
<P>
   Vanessa McCarthy, who lives in the West 70s, appreciates the
in-house channel because packages from her husband's office are
often delivered late at night. ``If I'm expecting a messenger I
turn on Channel 77 and see who it is,'' she said. ``If something
were to happen, you get a picture of who it is.''
</P>
<P>
   An in-house channel also lets people spy on their neighbors.
This is a plus, said Cogan, who said business has doubled every
year in the past several years. ``There's always someone in the
building who has nothing better to do than sit there and monitor
the lobby,'' he said. ``So they'll keep it on the TV and this gives
you an extra set of eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   There is one small inconvenience: People must go over to the
television set and turn it on before they can see who is ringing.
The solution to that is a video intercom, a screen-and-telephone
combination mounted on the wall. Because this requires equipment
plus rewiring, it is relatively costly _ perhaps $6,000 or $7,000
to retrofit that 12-unit brownstone.
</P>
<P>
   Video intercoms have been around for about two dozen years but
fell out of favor because of problems with repairs, maintenance and
spare parts, security experts say. Still, as technology improves
and costs drop, they expect these units will become more widely
used.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies tout keyless entry systems, with cards that can
be swiped like a Metrocard or poked in a slot, ATM style. But these
are still uncommon on outside doors in New York, and are used more
against problem tenants than intruders. Because the cards can be
programmed or deprogrammed, departing tenants can't walk off with
usable keys and current tenants can't pass out duplicates.
</P>
<P>
   John Jay's McCrie, for one, speculated that such high-tech
security systems would eventually become more widespread. ``Perhaps
in the future there will be a biometric system or the use of a
transistor that will allow people to enter,'' he said _ a kind of
EZ Pass for pedestrians.

EDITORIAL NOTEBOOK: UPROAR OVER QUIET IN THE ADIRONDACKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By ELEANOR RANDOLPH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The N.Y. Times said in an editorial, Sunday, June 28:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ADIRONDACK STATE PARK, N.Y. _ The lake, like thousands of others
created by New York's ancient glaciers, is small and remote, a
narrow valley of water less than two miles, end to end. At one
time, its underground springs nurtured brook trout, and to hear the
old fishermen talk, these glistening creatures tasted like no
modern food, certainly not like the experimental, acid-resistant
species now grown, ``neutered'' and dumped from state helicopters
into the lakes below.
</P>
<P>
   Acid rain from the Midwest is the plague that we often use to
explain our ghostly fish, as well as our forests singed orange by
thunderstorms and the neighboring ponds turning as tart as lemon
juice. It is an all-purpose peril, this cloud-borne pollution, and
it can even be adapted to explain seasonal aberrations in the
nature of things. This year, for example, there are no mice and no
chipmunks. Our basement and the balsam trees outside the windows
are uncommonly silent.
</P>
<P>
   We can blame distant industries for the silence, but the noise
we bring on ourselves. And it is one of the reasons that some
neighbors no longer wave automatically to each other as their boats
or cars pass within eyeing distance. Our lake, which of course does
not belong to any of us who borrow it for a few months each summer,
has become a tense battleground in the national recreation wars
between those who yearn for nature's quiet and those who thrill to
man-made sound _ in our case, the big-throated roar of a high-speed
motorboat.
</P>
<P>
   The split between the big boaters and the small boaters has
hardened people on both sides of our tiny summer community. When we
tried a do-it-yourself solution a few years ago, the majority did
not rule because there was no real way to enforce our communal law
on the minority. ``Un-American,'' the angry few grumbled, as we
worked to stop the high horsepower motors from churning our small
lake into a thick brown stew. ``Nobody can tell me what to do in
the Adirondacks,'' they said, thereby muscling their freedom into
position as the only freedom allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Like other lakeside communities, we then moved our petitions for
relief to local and state governments. This season we are fighting
over something called ``no-wake zones.'' Ever since 1942, New York
State law has decreed that most boats, but not those launching
skiers or barges in canals, must move slowly within 100 feet of the
shore. Now the idea is to expand the slow zone to 200 feet from
shore to stop erosion and turbidity, and improve safety for humans
and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   John Miller, president of the New York State Federation of
Lakes, tends the lakes in our area like a shepherd worrying over
his flock. He has been pushing the 200-foot zone because he argues
that although the number of motorboats in the state is growing,
from 100,000 or so in 1942 to almost 500,000 today, ``the number of
lakes stays the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who watch the gasoline scum on the water surface and
hear the loons screaming at boats several hundred yards away know
that 200 feet is a very short distance between a waterway and a
wilderness.

   With CHINA-RELIGION-$ADV28 _ BEIJING _ Sunday evening in the
candlelit sanctuary of Dong Tang, a ``patriotic'' Catholic church,
a four-year-old Chinese girl in a frilly dress sang the memorized
words of a hymn with as much gusto as the adults around her. More
than 200 worshipers chanted alleluias, partook holy communion and
heard of miraculous events at the Sermon on the Mount. Elderly men,
young couples, three sweaty teens in baggy pants -- basketball in
tow -- filled two-thirds of the pews last week. The
Chinese-language service looked much like a mass in America. But
the priest could not mention Catholicism's most revered living
figure, Pope John Paul II, or even whisper a reference to an issue
central to the church worldwide: the stand against abortion. And
fortunately for the four-year-old's mother, no hard-line Chinese
authorities were in Dong Tang (East Church) that night looking for
violators of government mandates, because it is forbidden to spread
religion to anyone under 18. These are the kinds of restrictions
advocates of human rights hope President Bill Clinton's visit today
to a Beijing Protestant church will spotlight. (Kunstel, Cox News

   SOUTH-OZONE _ From Miami to Nashville, ozone alerts have been

summer. And with new, more stringent ozone rules now being enforced
by the EPA, a number of metro areas in the Southeast could face the
same sort of restrictions on highway construction and smoke-stack
industries that Atlanta has felt for several years. But EPA also
has a plan to fight ozone in the South and the target is dirty
coal-fired power plants. (Harmon, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   ECOLI-STOP _ After Mary Heersink's 11-year-old son barely
survived the onslaught of a deadly food-borne bacterium, she could
have returned home after a seven-week hospital vigil and gratefully
resumed her stay-at-homemom duties. But she couldn't. Not with what

STOP, a network of parents to stop the spread of the deadly
pathogen. (Guthrie, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   ECOLI-DOOLEY _ Dan and Melissa Dooley are low-key people. Only a
small yellow ribbon tied in a bow and attached to a tall green
shrub near their driveway hinted at their ordeal. The Dooleys

   FLORIDA-FIRES _ For decades Southerners have weathered the
Fourth of July heat in Florida to take the kids to the beach while
school is out and the Firecracker 500 is being held at Daytona. But
there will be no firecrackers this Fourth in bone-dry,
wildfire-burned Florida, and in some places smoke is drifting out

on the beach where encroaching waves lap precariously close to its

leave it where it belongs and beat back the seas. (Finger, Atlanta

HAWAII ON THE HUDSON? OUTRIGGER RACERS HOPE SO 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a spectacle of endurance and speed more commonly
seen on the turquoise waters of Polynesia, dozens of paddling teams
raced outrigger canoes through the steely gray swells of New York
Harbor Saturday in the second-annual Liberty World Challenge, a
15-mile paddling sprint.
</P>
<P>
   Racing outriggers is increasing in popularity as a competitive
sport across the country and around the world, and organizers of
Saturday's event said they hoped to bring mana, the ancient
Polynesian life spirit, to New York City. After all, they said,
Manhattan is an island, just like Oahu.
</P>
<P>
   Well, sort of.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Hawaii, it's a little different,'' said Todd Bradley, an
all-star paddler and one of seven members of Team Hawaii, who are
serving this weekend as outrigging's ambassadors to New York. ``We
have beaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, incongruities abounded. Instead of laying their
45-foot-long boats on soft sand and gently dragging them into the
surf, the paddlers cushioned the boats on old tires to keep them
off the asphalt at Pier 25 just north of Battery Park City. To get
to the water, the boats had to be carried over a fence and down a
metal ramp to a small wooden dock.
</P>
<P>
   And the canoe teams, who came from the Northeast and as far away
as California, Hawaii and the South Pacific, were framed against
the staggering skyline of lower Manhattan. ``We're getting whiplash
looking around,'' Bradley said. ``Wow, there's the Statue of
Liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the spirit of the ancient sport prevailed. Before the
women's teams sped off in the first race Saturday morning, several
of the teams huddled together to offer a group puli, or prayer.
``Please make us No. 1,'' they pleaded in Hawaiian.
</P>
<P>
   In the women's race Saturday, the No. 1 designation went to the
Wicked Wahines, a team of powerful paddlers who were gathered for
this event by Sheila Conover-Doyle, a three-time Olympic kayaker
from San Diego. She was joined by Chance Adair, also from San
Diego; two Hawaiians, Laurie Antonellis of Kauai and Elizabeth
Dolezai of Maui; and two New Englanders, Karen Levitt of Keene,
N.H., and Sue Slowick of Westhampton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   As the race began, and the long boats shot forward like arrows
from a bow, the Wicked Wahines _ ``wahine'' (pronounced wa-hee-nay)
is Hawaiian for ``woman'' _ quickly took a commanding lead. Racing
in a sharp yellow boat borrowed from the Kent Island Outrigger
Canoe Club from Maryland, the Wahines raced past Battery Park City,
past the glittering World Financial Center, and past a crowd of
dumbfounded tourists waiting to depart aboard the ferry to the
Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-mile course took them south from Pier 25 around the tip
of Manhattan to the Brooklyn Bridge where they turned and headed
back, looping twice around Governor's Island and the Statue of
Liberty before heading back north to Pier 25. The Wahines came in
first, , finishing the course in 2 hours, 14 minutes and 5 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in the first Liberty World Challenge only eight men's
teams and six women's teams participated. This year, there were 21
men's teams and 14 women's teams. And paddlers said they expected
the event to continue to grow in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outrigger has exploded on the East Coast,'' Ms. Conover-Doyle
said, explaining why she had flown from California to race in New
York for the first time this year. ``Last year we were home in
California watching CNN and we're like, `Oh my God, look at this,
there's an outrigger race around the Statue of Liberty.'''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's race, she said after climbing out of the winning
boat, was everything she expected. ``You go and you race in Hawaii
and there are the trade winds and the beautiful Hawaiian waters but
there's just something about paddling past the World Trade
building, Wall Street and you're on your way to the Statue of
Liberty. It's like wow, you're at the heart of America.''
</P>
<P>
   The sport has a history tracing back thousands of years to the
Pacific regions of Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia where
warlords often wagered on canoe races. Losers in those early
regattas sometimes paid with their lives. Canoeing, of course, also
has an even longer history in the Pacific as a peaceable mode of
transportation and important tool of commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Modern outrigging seems to combine all of these elements with
heated competition, a fun-loving enthusiasm among racers and
increasing sponsorship of teams by corporations to help with the
costs of boats, other equipment and travel to competitions around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see two different atmospheres,'' said Penelope Hunter,
44, a member of the Mountain Home Canoe Club in Portland, Ore., one
of the teams that competed Saturday. ``People are really friendly
up until the start of the race. And they'll be really friendly
after the race. But they'll just as soon cut your throat during the
race.''
</P>
<P>
   Classic outrigger canoes hold six paddlers including a steerer
at the rear.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional paddles are made of wood, which many racers believe
can catch the wind in its blade and translate it into power in the
water. Modern, ultralight paddles are made of carbon graphite.
</P>
<P>
   The 45-foot-long outrigger boats weigh approximately 400 pounds
and each one is equipped with an ama, or stabilizing bar, that is
attached to the side of the boat by wooden beams called iako. Even
with the ama, there is always a danger that a canoe will flip over.
</P>
<P>
   To race at optimum speed requires precise synchronization
between the six paddlers at a pace of about 68 strokes per minute.
</P>
<P>
   The boat captain calls out commands telling the paddlers when to
switch sides, usually after every 12 strokes.

SUITS SHINE SPOTLIGHT ON STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., N.J., Conn.)   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The job of state attorney general has sometimes been ridiculed
as attracting ambitious officeholders and then stranding them in
political oblivion. According to one old political maxim, ``AG''
stands not for attorney general, but for aspiring governor.
</P>
<P>
   But over the last couple of years, a new activism by the chief
legal officers in many states has made their job more
consequential. It began with the state lawsuits against tobacco
companies, which accelerated the national battle over smoking. It
expanded when 20 states, including New York and Connecticut, joined
the Justice Department in filing antitrust charges against
Microsoft in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``These actions and the attention the media gave them have put
attorneys general, for the first time in history, front and center
all across the country,'' said Robert Abrams, a former New York
state attorney general who was the unsuccessful Democratic U.S.
Senate nominee in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   It would be an exaggeration to say the new attention is turning
the region's attorneys general into celebrities. ``If you stop 10
people on the street, 9 of them wouldn't know who I am,'' said New
Jersey Attorney General Peter Verniero.
</P>
<P>
   Still, attorneys general are in the news more than ever before,
including Verniero (whose post is filled by the governor under New
Jersey law), Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Dennis Vacco of
New York, who are both seeking re-election this year.
</P>
<P>
   The attention is likely only to grow now, with last week's court
victory by Microsoft in a separate case in which an appeals court
approved the way the company sells its software for navigating the
Internet. That could strengthen the company's hand in the broad
antitrust case brought by the government and the 20 states.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the failure of federal tobacco legislation has
returned a national focus to the states' tobacco suits, including
suits pending by New York, Connecticut and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Although joint suits by states are not new, the widespread
public attention and strong feelings surrounding the Microsoft and
tobacco cases have made the politics of the attorney general jobs
more convoluted. And that, some legal and political analysts say,
has only increased public confusion over what it is, exactly, that
attorneys general do.
</P>
<P>
   That confusion, some experts say, comes partly because the
responsibilities of attorneys general are defined differently in
different states and partly because the politics of the job often
make the job itself seem more perplexing than may be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because there is an absence of a firm understanding of what
the job is, it permits you to be a chameleon in the race,'' said
Eliot Spitzer, one of four Democrats competing to challenge Vacco,
the Republican incumbent in New York.
</P>
<P>
   For years, state attorneys general were known mostly for the
routine work that is the heart of their responsibilities. They
defend their states from thousands of suits each year dealing with
such subjects as claims against government officials and accidents
on state land. In recent decades, they have also filed scores of
suits annually on such usually undramatic causes as charities
fraud, price fixing and consumer complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Such work created some political stars, like Joseph Lieberman,
the U.S. senator from Connecticut, and Jacob Javits, the former
U.S. senator from New York, both of whom were their state's
attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   But many more attorneys general have failed than succeeded in
their bids for higher office, including Abrams.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams reeled off an informal tally on the subject. The ratio,
he said, was something like 35 attorneys general failing in bids
for higher office to 5 who made it to such positions as governor or
U.S. senator in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics say even the tobacco and Microsoft cases are little
more than new efforts to turn the attorney general offices into
political stepping stones. But some of the attorneys general note
that their tobacco cases are playing a pivotal role in an issue
that the federal government has been struggling with for a
generation. And some legal experts say it is impossible to assess
whether the presence of the aggressive state attorneys general
stiffened the Justice Department's resolve to move against
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews in their offices in Trenton, Hartford and New
York, the three incumbent attorneys general described themselves
as, essentially, apolitical lawyers who view legal issues with
clinical detachment. Vacco, 45, who is often described as a
conservative Republican and who won four years ago ardently
supporting the death penalty, for example, described himself as ``a
balanced, practical problem solver.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal, 52, a Democrat, said, ``I'm certainly a practicing
lawyer in this job, and I pride myself on it.'' He is often
described as liberal and was a protege of the archetypal
Connecticut liberal Senator, the late Abraham A. Ribicoff. But he
said he does not describe himself as liberal.
</P>
<P>
   Among attorneys general, at least, it is not considered shrewd
to appear partisan. ``You check politics at the door in this
position,'' said Verniero, 39, a Republican, who admits he has been
a political ``junkie'' since he was a teen-ager. Before becoming
attorney general, he was chief counsel and chief of staff to New
Jersey's Republican governor, Christie Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Verniero insisted on an apolitical point of
view. But he happened to mention various points on which he agreed
with Whitman, and none on which he disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal, who is running for a third term in November, is in
the ticklish position of insisting he is nothing more than a
visionary lawyer for his state, while hinting that his politics do
make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   He did manage to note that, in his opinion, he had been out
front in battling the tobacco companies without any help from
Connecticut's Republican governor, John G. Rowland, until the
political winds shifted against the tobacco industry. A spokesman
for Rowland, however, insisted that the Governor ``was supportive
of the attorney general right from the start.''
</P>
<P>
   In the big political tent in New York, of course, Vacco's race
for re-election has already been marked by intense politics. He has
reveled in an active role in both the tobacco and Microsoft suits,
which could appeal to Democratic and downstate voters. But critics
contend that both cases suggest blatant politicking, since Vacco's
stance appears philosophically inconsistent with a conservative
viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Before he filed a tobacco suit, Vacco was quoted as describing
such suits as silly enough to be compared to suing dairy companies
for causing cholesterol damage. In the interview, he seemed to back
away from that position. But his early lack of enthusiasm has led
some Democratic opponents to call him a ``Dennis come lately'' to
the anti-tobacco cause.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Vacco's involvement in the Microsoft antitrust case
has brought the wrong sort of attention from people who might be
considered natural supporters.
</P>
<P>
   In a column expressing consternation about the new activism of
state attorneys general and their role in the Microsoft suit, Paul
Gigot, The Wall Street Journal's conservative columnist, recently
accused Vacco of ``a political transformation worthy of the
accolade `Clintonian,''' which Gigot did not seem to mean as a
compliment.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco, a former U.S. attorney in Buffalo, won his position four
years ago with a razor-thin margin over Karen Burstein, his
Democratic opponent. He is widely considered politically vulnerable
this year.
</P>
<P>
   In that context, he explained the attacks on him. ``Politics,''
he said, was the explanation. Sounding misunderstood and a bit
hurt, he said people like Gigot were confused about the Microsoft
suit, which he described as probusiness because it is aimed at
encouraging competition.
</P>
<P>
   The politics of the tobacco and Microsoft cases often put Vacco
at odds with traditional Republican ideology. He said, for example,
that Gov. George Pataki, has told him of concerns about the
Microsoft suit.
</P>
<P>
   But Vacco made it clear that he is a long way from courting any
quarrel with the politically strong governor who is at the head of
his ticket. ``George Pataki calls me,'' Vacco said, snapping his
fingers, ``and I'm there.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the would-be opponents and lawyers who watch attorneys
general say it is a job that attracts ambitious politicians because
it regularly allows the incumbent to work his way into news
accounts with worthy battles.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, worthiness is sometimes in the eye of the beholder.
Blumenthal speaks passionately about fighting polluters, protecting
consumers and going to war for children. But Santa Mendoza, a
41-year old West Hartford lawyer who is the likely Republican
candidate for Connecticut attorney general, took issue with
Blumenthal's description of his accomplishments. ``Being
immortalized during the 6 o'clock news, has been, during his eight
years in office, his top priority,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even in New Jersey, where the attorneys general have seldom run
for election to anything, the political bug seems to bite occupants
of the office. John Degnan, the attorney general for Gov. Brendan
Byrne, and W. Carey Edwards, the attorney general for Gov. Thomas
H. Kean, are among the former attorneys general who have failed in
quests for gubernatorial election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they get the idea that they are more prominent than they
really are,'' said Ronald Chen, an associate dean of Rutgers Law
School.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the lure, there is always a list of lawyers who would
love to have the job at almost any cost. By the time the election
rolls around in November in New York, Vacco and the four Democratic
candidates who are battling each other in a primary are, by some
estimates, expected to have spent a total of about $10 million
trying to win the position.
</P>
<P>
   And after all that, it seems clear that most citizens will not
know much more about the job than they do right now. G. Oliver
Koppell, a Democrat who succeeded Abrams as attorney general in New
York and then lost his job in a primary four years ago, is
competing to win the Democratic nomination with Spitzer, state Sen.
Catherine Abate, and Evan Davis, a former counsel to Gov. Mario
Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   From his experience not only occupying the job, but running for
it as well, Koppell offered a timeless observation: ``The public,
in general,'' he said, ``is completely uninformed about the
attorney general's office.''

IMMIGRANTS RUSH TO BEAT NEW CITIZENSHIP FEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WINNIE HU   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When George Ku emigrated from Hong Kong seven years
ago, he complained to his friends about the fees for applying to
become a U.S. citizen. But now he tells them the $95 that the
government charges is a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the cheapest price right now,'' said Ku, 44, as he picked
up an application form Saturday at a citizenship drive at the
corner of Mulberry and Bayard Streets in Chinatown. ``If you wait,
then it will be worse for you. I tell everyone to hurry up.''
</P>
<P>
   The fee for a citizenship application would more than double to
$225 as early as Oct. 1 under a proposal by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service. The increased fee, which was announced in
January, is being reviewed by immigration service officials but is
expected to be approved, said Eric Andrus, an INS spokesman in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The expected increase has spurred several immigrants' rights
groups in New York to step up citizenship drives. The city's
Department of Youth and Community Development, which oversees a
$4.6 million program to help immigrants become citizens, may set up
a special fund to aid poorer applicants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are discussing creating a fund to help with hardship
cases,'' said Bob Mascali, a spokesman for the department. ``This
is going to be a problem for people trying to scrape by. We know
it's coming down the road so we are in discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   During Saturday's three-hour citizenship drive in Chinatown,
more than 300 people crowded around two tables where volunteers for
the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund passed out
application forms and fliers that read: ``Beat the fee increase!
Become a U.S. citizen!''
</P>
<P>
   Tito Sinha, an immigration lawyer who organized the drive, said
the group will hold another drive next month in Flushing, and hold
a free legal clinic there every week through the summer. Last year,
the group helped mainly Asian immigrants fill out 300 citizenship
applications. Sinha said he expected a 20 percent increase this
year.
</P>
<P>
   But other immigrants' rights groups are taking a lower-key
approach. Wangsheng Li, director of legal services for the New York
Association for New Americans, said publicizing the expected $225
fee may cause confusion. He said some people may rush to file their
applications before they have met the residency requirement of five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't feel comfortable creating that panic among
immigrants,'' he said. ``It encourages them to apply too early and
then they get rejected. If you're a day short, then you're out of
luck. We've seen those kinds of things. People come to us in
tears.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrus, the immigration service spokesman, said the increase is
needed cover the rising cost of processing applications. ``The
bottom line is that this is what it costs the INS,'' he said. ``We
don't make any money.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the increase is inappropriate at a time the
service is being widely assailed for long delays in processing
applications. The average processing time for a citizenship
application filed in the New York area is 20 to 24 months,
according to the INS. In May, there was a backlog of 292,213
citizenship applications from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's outrageous that they charge $225 when they're
forcing people to wait two years,'' said Mark Hetfield, a
representative for the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, which helps
Jewish refugees in New York.

CRUISING COMFORTABLY ON THE TURKISH COAST 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KALKAN, Turkey _ A mousey-looking, all-wood schooner called a
gulet has been the workhorse of the Turkish Mediterranean ``blue
voyages'' for more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Now, gulets are getting a face lift as comfort-conscious
Americans want bigger and better. Traditionally, these coastal
cruisers were built at about 50 feet; now they are coming in at 120
feet and provide a perfect environment for those who just want to
put up their feet and watch the clouds roll by.
</P>
<P>
   These broad-beamed boats with voluminous deck space are for hire
along the Turkish coast, a place of hidden surprises where one
undiscovered cove might hide a 1,500-year-old temple.
</P>
<P>
   The spring and summer months are the busiest time for these
efficient workhorses. They hold up to six couples in varying
degrees of comfort, and provide one of the great travel bargains as
well as allowing the passive sailor to combine an actual marine
experience with cruising comforts.
</P>
<P>
   A recent four-day, three-night cruise in a newly minted
120-footer named the Amazon Solo cost only $450 a person. That
included three meals a day and wine.
</P>
<P>
   The accommodations on the Amazon Solo were surprising: a double
bed, a separate head and shower. All rooms look out at the water.
</P>
<P>
   The blue voyage got its name, naturally, from the technicolored
blue of the water. An informal route began in the early 60s when
historians wanted to rediscover a lost part of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these blue voyagers rediscovered the Blue Cave, a sea
cave near Kalkan that is one of the country's natural wonders.
There is the bay at Myra, where you slow down to view a series of
tombs cut into rock. There are places called Rat Island, Goat
Island, Snake Island. Along the way, you might spy a dolphin.
</P>
<P>
   Tours begin from Kalkan, a city on the eastern Mediterranean,
and Bodrun, which is becoming known as the Riviera of Turkey for
its cosmopolitan crowd, including the financier Ahmet Ertegun and
the actor Dustin Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   Most blue voyages last three nights and four days but guests
often take a week, especially if they are traveling with friends.
No matter, on a boat this size, you make friends the moment you
walk up the gangplank and remove your shoes, as is required. You
don't want to scuff the wood, which is what you'll be on virtually
every moment out of your room. In fact, you'll spend most of the
day barefooted. Not even deck shoes are permitted.
</P>
<P>
   The boats are hand-built of chestnut and oak, the interior of
cedar and Indian walnut by local craftsmen in the Black Sea. It was
from there, say the sailors, that adventurous souls set out to
South America more than 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the cruising is on motor power. Because the boats are
close to shore, there are times when there isn't enough wind. But
for a few hours a day, when the wind is right (not too strong, mind
you, because these are not ocean-going vessels), they hoist the
sails.
</P>
<P>
   The captain barks orders in Turkish and then there is quiet,
except for the whoosh of wind into the sails.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the wide decks, there is room for everyone to sit and
schmooz aft, where meals are often served. The fellow doing the
serving could be the chef, a deck hand, or even the captain.
Usually, dinner is below in the combination living room-dining
room-den.
</P>
<P>
   If you sail to the west out of Kalkan in southeast Turkey, you
will stop at one of the 12 Islands of Gocek, supposedly a favorite
of Cleopatra's. In fact, the legend goes, she was so taken with one
of the islands that her inamorata, Marc Antony, shipped a boatload
of sand from these beaches back to her in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Like Marc Antony, you'll pass the Blue Lagoon of Oludeniz, and
you can ask to stop at Gemiler Island and take a hike across
Byzantine ruins. If someone's on duty, he will charge you about $2.
</P>
<P>
   The eastbound trip _ you get both directions if you go for a
week _ includes the Basilica of St. Nicholas. Yes, Jolly Old Saint
Nick was born in Turkey. Then, you spot the ruins of a sunken city
at Kekova. Don't expect to swim among them, though. The Turkish
government has decided to draw the line here. Still, you can sail
among them.
</P>
<P>
   You can get information about the Amazon Solo by faxing a
request to Turkey at 011-90-252-645-2683. Through September, rates
run about $400 per person for three nights, about $700 for five
nights, and about $750 for a week. To make reservations on other
gulets of varying sizes, try Efor Travel and Tours in New York at

 &HT;    Alabama GOP in holy war: Candidates clash, use religion as
weapon
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. _ Alabama Republicans are waging holy war for
the gubernatorial nomination as they head into Tuesday's runoff
election, and appear to be trying to out-Christian each other.
</P>
<P>
   Incumbent Gov. Fob James employs former Christian Coalition
director Ralph Reed as a consultant and reminds voters of his firm
support of school prayer. Challenger businessman Winton Blount
quotes Proverbs in radio commercials and professes his belief in
Jesus Christ.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder popular analysis of the race frames this as a
window to the GOP's national soul. But the deciding factor simply
may come down to style.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people misunderstand this election as a clash between
the religious right and fiscal conservatives,'' said Wayne Flynt,
an Auburn University history professor and critic of James.
``Certainly there's that matchup, but this is more about a
bumbling, inept politician making one mistake after another.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican voters Tuesday _ as well as an undetermined number of
Democratic crossovers _ will consider who has the best tax pledge
and whether James has crystallized the stereotype of a backwoods
state or prevailed as a champion for religious freedom.
</P>
<P>
   James, 63, has threatened to call out the National Guard to
protect the Ten Commandments hung on a county courtroom wall, told
Alabamians to ignore a federal judge's order limiting school prayer
and once imitated a monkey's walk during a meeting to illustrate a
textbook's characterization of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Blount, 55, casts those images as embarrassing to a state trying
to economically keep pace with its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does image mean?'' James said. ``When you can't talk
about reality, you talk about imagery. I'm not much of an imagery
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Daryl Dewberry, a 46-year-old Birmingham coal miner, crossed
over from the Democratic Party in 1994 to vote for James. ``He has
a down-to-earth ability to communicate with people,'' Dewberry
said.
</P>
<P>
   James has hitched his re-election to a ``No New Taxes'' bus
tour, promising efficient spending of state revenue with no
additional levies while deriding Blount for not making the same
promise. Blount counters with a plan to trim the state tax on
groceries.
</P>
<P>
   But the substantive differences between the candidates have been
blurred by backbiting so harsh that Republicans worry the wounds
may be too damaged to heal by the November general election against
Democrat Don Siegelman, the lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   Anonymously circulated fliers refer to a 1969 wreck that killed
Blount's first wife and imply she may have been dead before the
``trajic (sic) accident'' with Blount behind the wheel of his
Jaguar. James disavows responsibility for the ``smear sheet.''
</P>
<P>
   And the difference is?
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, a Blount radio ad intimates the governor lied
about a family-owned landfill that has benefited from business with
the state and that he may have committed perjury in the trial of a
former agency leader James had fired for theft.
</P>
<P>
   Roger McConnell, chairman of Alabama's Republican Party, has
``encouraged both candidates to stay focused on issues,'' but he's
certain the summer rancor will make his job tougher this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be easy for us,'' McConnell said. ``If Don Siegelman
positions himself as a conservative and there's no difference
between our two candidates, then we're in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   James won 48 percent of the vote in the five-man GOP primary
June 2. Blount took 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Alabama Republican Party, unlike the Democratic
party, has an open primary, a wild card Tuesday will be two brands
of Democratic crossover. One is the long-standing white-flight
version that once supported George Wallace and later Hunt. The
other is a new entry: urban blacks encouraged by Birmingham Mayor
Richard Arrington to vote for Blount. During the candidates' final
debate in Birmingham, James said his vision is for the state to
become No. 1 in the nation in SAT scores. Blount urged voters to
``throw off the shackles of low expectations.'' Playing on a
campaign trip to Huntsville's space center, Blount said, ``We went
to the moon from Alabama, we're going to Mars from Alabama and a
change is going to happen on Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, James was asked to rebut Blount's charges that the
image of the state has suffered under his administration. James
responded with a question _ and an image of his own, of Blount as
liberal spender:
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you hear the debate? Did you hear his closing remarks?
Have you ever heard such grandiose, pie-in-the-sky, Hubert
Humphrey-sounding nonsense in your life?''

 &HT;    Gingrich pulls out all stops in support of candidates
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- In 1996, Speaker Newt Gingrich starred in campaign
ads in Republican Anne Northup's Louisville, Ky., district.
</P>
<P>
   They were Democratic ads, of course, similar to ones running on
television stations around the country. Their aim was clear: Tie
Northup to Gingrich and beat her by pounding him.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker never set foot in the district during the campaign.
Northup eked out a victory and Gingrich held on to his job, as
well.
</P>
<P>
   As the Republican Party gears up once again to try to retain its
House majority in November, the Gingrich travel ban has been
relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   With the House on an extended vacation until the middle of July,
Gingrich will raise money for nine Republican incumbents, including
Northup and other freshmen, two statewide candidates in California
and state legislative hopefuls in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The stops will include a Salt Lake City fund-raiser for freshman
Rep. Merrill Cook (R-Utah) in an anti-tobacco stronghold. ``Many
Mormons would like to see Republicans take a stronger stand on
tobacco,'' Cook said. But he predicted the speaker would be warmly
received.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Gingrich will be with Northup in Louisville,
home of Brown &AMP; Williamson tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the speaker will dine with the Republican Party's
biggest contributors in the Napa Valley wine country in California,
part of a three-day swing through the most populous state.
</P>
<P>
   Among his more intriguing appearances will be a speech in Dallas
on Wednesday to the League of United Latin American Citizens'
annual meeting. Some LULAC chapters had considered boycotting the
event because they view the GOP agenda as anti-immigrant, spokesman
Larry Trejo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we've come to realize that we have to understand what
these people are saying,'' Trejo said.
</P>
<P>
   That this busy travel schedule also would serve Gingrich if he
decides to run for president has been lost on no one, said Gingrich
campaign spokesman Mike Shields.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of it is geared toward any kind of presidential politics.
But would it hurt, the fact that we're a national figure and get to
meet with all these people? No,'' Shields said.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that Gingrich already has visited 35 states this
year, exclusive of his publicity tour for ``Lessons Learned the
Hard Way,'' his recent book on the trials and tribulations of
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   And when Gingrich speaks on behalf of California Secretary of
State Bill Jones and U.S. Senate candidate Matt Fong, he will be
collecting IOUs that could come in handy in a presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But a more important purpose to his travels over the next two
weeks will be to gauge the reaction to a rush of Republican
proposals that emerged last week on health care, tobacco and taxes
_ three crucial topics for the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   On health care, House Republicans are proposing some expansion
of the rights of patients in managed care plans and other changes
that are more modest than Democrats would like.
</P>
<P>
   Their anti-teen-smoking bill will, at most, contain a small
price increase on cigarettes and will punish teen smokers, but not
the tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich also proposed a further cut in the capital gains tax _
from 20 percent to 15 percent, and from 15 percent to 7.5 percent
for low income taxpayers _ and asserted that it would not cost the
government. More people will sell their assets because of the lower
tax rate and actually bring in more tax revenues, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The House Democratic leader, Dick Gephardt of Missouri, said
Republicans are continuing their ``long march against the interest
of working families and children'' with last week's announcements.
</P>
<P>
   Of the Republican tobacco bill, only the outlines of which
emerged last week, Gephardt said, ``To put it in a word, this is
Big Tobacco's dream. ... It really should be the RJR Republican
Party. They are fully aligned with the interests of Big Tobacco.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt also included criticism of the House's approach to
campaign finance reform in his tirade against the GOP, saying it
``languishes on the floor'' of the House because of Republican
efforts to drag out the debate until August.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it is by no means clear that tobacco or health care or
campaign reform legislation will become law in 1998. (The tax cut
is another matter.)
</P>
<P>
   Legislative inaction on most topics might suit Republicans fine.
They would prefer to run on the budget surplus and tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   They are a confident bunch in the wake of their victory in a
special congressional election in New Mexico last week that
Democrats had hoped would create momentum for the fall.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for being sanguine, said Rep. John Linder (R-Ga.),
chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, is
that the well-funded Democrat in New Mexico never tried to use
tobacco as an issue, an indication that Democrats do not have the
magic bullet in tobacco that they have claimed.
</P>
<P>
   And, Republicans wonder happily, if Democrats can't capitalize
on close links between the Republicans and an industry that has
made lawyers, politicians and journalists seem popular, what
weapons will Democrats have to oust Gingrich as speaker?

6-27 -- A policeman stands guard in the main plaza of El Bosque,
Chiapas, after government forces recaptured the town hall from
Zapatista supporters. The operation at El Bosque was the fourth in
a series of government military actions since April to dismantle
what the Zapatistas call their ``autonomous'' town governments. The
incident showed how volatile the conflict in Chiapas has become.

he believes five of the nine units are being used for short-term
rentals. In a city with a burnished new image, waves of tourism,
and booked-up hotels, it was bound to happen: bed-and-breakfasts
are springing up all over Manhattan. Most operators of transient
rooms in residential buildings violate not only zoning laws and
building codes, but also do not have proper licenses and many do
not pay sales or hotel taxes. (Edward Keating/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT4) OAKLAND, Calif. -- June 27, 1998 -- HUD-DRUG-EVICTIONS,
6-27 --Herman Walker, who lives in public housing in Oakland, is
fighting an eviction stemming from accusations that a caretaker and
a visitor had illegal narcotics or paraphernalia in his apartment.
The resulting lawsuit filed by Walker and three others illustrates
a growing conflict between Federal officials, who have urged local
housing agencies to crack down on illegal drug use, and some
advocates for the poor, who say that innocent people are falling
victim to a Draconian offensive in the war on drugs. (Peter

The Rev. Deborah Little has conducted church services at Boston
Common for two years, reaching out to people like Paul Kirouac.
Every Sunday at 1 p.m. for the past two years, she has set up a
cross beside Brewer Fountain, near Tremont and Park Streets, and
rolled up a wooden box that does triple duty as altar, kitchen and
clothes closet. ``The Christian tradition and others say if you
want to get closer to the heart of life, of God, go and be closer
to the poor,'' says Ms. Little, 53. (Evan Richman/New York Times

-- Penny Gagliano, 14, of Grand Junction, Colo., fires during a
shooting tournament. In Rifle, shooting competitions are a way of
life. So in a town with a strong gun culture, it was with alarm and
uneasiness that residents watched as teen-age boys, from rural
towns just like Rifle, showed up at schoolyard after schoolyard
around the nation, and turned their rifles on unsuspecting
classmates. Residents are seeking ways to keep it from happening
here. (Kevin Moloney/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT1) RIFLE, Colo. -- June 27, 1998 -- COLO-RIFLE-TOWN-1, 6-27
-- Guns are as much a part of growing up in Rifle, as teddy bears
and crayons. But with reports of schoolyard shootings in similiar
rural towns, Rifle residents worry that the same thing could happen
there. Pat Payne, 10, recently took part in a shooting match as his
father, Criss watches. (Kevin Moloney/New York Times Photo)

CONGRESSWOMAN FAULTS CLINTON'S REMARKS ON RIGHTS

   WASHINGTON _ A congresswoman known as a particularly harsh
critic of the Clinton administration's China policy said Saturday
that President Clinton's comments on human rights were intended for
his detractors in the United States, but did little to assist
reform in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said what was needed for American consumption without
assisting the cause of democratic reform in China,'' said Rep.
Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   She said that the exchange between Clinton and President Jiang
Zemin ``may end up being harmful to the cause of dissidents in
China,'' and that the Clinton administration was ``buying into the
Chinese view that the Tiananmen era is in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, she said, ``keeps mentioning personal freedom, but what
is important is political expression.'' She said the Chinese
``can't speak out about political or religious matters without
being punished.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the president's visit to Beijing ``falls short of what
we would generally call a summit'' because ``the Chinese didn't
make any concessions; we accepted their terms.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The product is not worthy of a summit,'' she said.

MRS. CLINTON MEETS WITH LEADERS OF CHINA'S WOMEN'S MOVEMENT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BEIJING _ Hillary Rodham Clinton met with some of the best and
brightest of Beijing's vibrant women's movement on Saturday,
discussing a wide range of sometimes sensitive issues from domestic
violence to unemployment to China's high rates of female suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton mostly sat back and listened as the panel of seven
Chinese women told of the multitude of problems women in this
country still face and of their work to solve them.
</P>
<P>
   Although many of the panelists have long been outspoken on
women's issues in front of small groups, such frank discussion in a
public international forum was unusual. And the light atmosphere
was in marked contrast to the tension surrounding the International
Women's Conference that Mrs. Clinton attended in Beijing in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The panelists included Xie Lihua, a journalist who has
championed the cause of China's rural women, and Liu Bohong of the
official All-China Women's Federation, who displayed the newly
published Chinese translation of the American women's medical work,
``Our Bodies, Ourselves'' (Touchstone, 1996).
</P>
<P>
   At the end, a clearly appreciative Mrs. Clinton said, ``I don't
think I've ever been in a more lively, energetic and informed
discussion than this one today.''
</P>
<P>
   The panelists described the many projects under way to improve
the status of women, but their remarks were filled with reminders
that deep-rooted cultural discrimination persists, particularly in
the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Xie likes to remind people that if you knock at a door in
rural China, women are likely to answer, ``Nobody's home,'' if
there are no men inside.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, she founded the magazine Rural Women Knowing
All to give women in the countryside a voice. At Saturday's forum,
she described how the magazine had published self-help articles on
reproductive health, set up programs for women who are migrant
workers in Beijing and helped organize small loans for women to
start cottage industries.
</P>
<P>
   But she and other panelists described with bittersweet smiles
the biases that such women's programs must overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Ge Youli of the U.N. Development Program in Beijing told of
organizing meetings in the countryside to explain loan programs for
women and having only husbands turn up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We say `Where are your wives?''' Ms. Ge said. ``They say, `At
home cooking, of course.''' She described how the men are then
instructed to play a game of what Americans call ``Telephone,''
where the first is given a message which is passed down a line of
10. By the end, she said, the message had changed. ``That's why
your wives should be here,'' she told them.
</P>
<P>
   But the panelists also told of poor rural women who with the
help of such loans had escaped dreary lives by setting up
prosperous businesses, such as tofu shops and pig farms, and of how
the traditional notion that ``only men are important'' was
changing.
</P>
<P>
   Another panelist, Chen Mingxia, a lawyer at the Chinese Academy
of Social Sciences, described work in educating women about their
legal rights. Although China has a fairly comprehensive women's
rights law on paper, discrimination against women is common in
areas like hiring and housing.
</P>
<P>
   At Beijing's prestigious universities there is a saying to
describe the hiring hierarchy on graduation: first men with a
Beijing residency permit, then men without a Beijing residency
permit, only then the women.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chen described how a rural legal aid center helped a woman
who wanted to divorce her abusive husband but had neither the money
nor the know-how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   The panelists excitedly described a wide range of ambitious
projects to improve the status of women, from efforts to improve
the high drop-out rate among rural girls to Ms. Liu's research on
images of women in the media. Some are conducted under the auspices
of the Chinese government and others receive financing from foreign
organizations, like the Ford Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most revealing about how far the discussion has come
since 1995 was the moment when Ms. Liu produced the bright
red-covered ``American Our Bodies, Ourselves,'' a translation
project that at times had been stalled by political debates about
what could and could not be said in China.
</P>
<P>
   No matter that the final product was missing the American
edition's sections on lesbianism and masturbation or that a number
of pictures were not reproduced. At last, the book was out. &QL;

LIVE DEBATE ON TV IS A RARITY FOR CHINESE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (subs to expand next-to-lst graf)  (See also: CHINA-SUMMIT, CHINA-REACT, CHINA-ASSESS, CHINA-HILLARY) 
(lb)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ What is perhaps most remarkable about Saturday's
exchange between President Clinton and President Jiang Zemin is
that the debate, covering sensitive topics from human rights to
Tibet, was broadcast live all over China, via China Central
Television-1, the government's main television station.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a first,'' said a senior editor from the
station, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``We've never done
live coverage of a press conference between Chinese leaders and
leaders from another country before.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, live television coverage of important political events
is a relatively new development here. Last fall, when Jiang visited
the United States, all events were taped, edited and shown later.
Difficult discussions, like portions of the joint news conference
between the Chinese and American presidents in Washington, or
possibly embarrassing scenes, like Jiang swimming in Hawaii, were
edited out.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday, any Chinese citizen could have watched the two
presidents debate the merits of arresting dissidents and the 1989
crackdown on student-led demonstrators in Tiananmen Square. Any
citizen, that is, who happened to be tuned to CCTV-1 at midday on a
blisteringly hot summer Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   For although the news conference was broadcast live in its
entirety, it was never listed on television schedules or otherwise
advertised. And, hours after a lively debate in which both
presidents performed admirably, the conference effectively
disappeared _ replaced by an edited version for the evening news.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese television has just recently moved toward live coverage
of important political events _ although clearly with great
ambivalence. Aside from a brief period in the spring of 1989, when
press controls were eased and some episodes in the democracy
movement were broadcast live, only highly ceremonial events, like
treaty signings, or scripted speeches by Chinese leaders were shown
as they happened.
</P>
<P>
   State television produced 10 live broadcasts from the National
People's Congress session in March, including a somewhat
controversial news conference in which a Western reporter asked the
newly elected prime minister, Zhu Rongi, to comment on the
Tiananmen crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   But Zhu, after all, is a reliable party man. This time, who knew
what Clinton might say?
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, said the CCTV editor, the station's leaders decided
to go ahead with a broadcast. He said the decision was partly a
reflection of the government-controlled media's greater openness,
and partly an acknowledgment that it has become harder to conceal
news from Chinese citizens these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't hesitate to show it live even though we knew that
lots of sensitive topics could come up,'' the editor said. ``But if
we didn't do it there are other ways for people to get news, from
other stations or from the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was there for an hour. And then it was gone _ to the
disappointment of the many Chinese excited about the Clinton visit
who said they would have tuned in if only they had known.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The handling of the news conference followed what is becoming a
familiar pattern: sensitive moments from live broadcasts of the
National People's Congress, including some of Zhu's remarks and the
retirement of the popular foreign minister, Qian Qichen, were also
later relegated to the cutting-room floor.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, hours after the news conference, extensive reports
by the official New China News Agency omitted Clinton's statement
that the ``tragic loss of life'' in Tiananmen Square was ``wrong.''
Nor did they include an American reporter's question about the
detention of four dissidents in Xian and 2,000 other dissidents
reported to be in jail. They did, however, obliquely acknowledge
that Clinton has raised the issues of Tiananmen, Tibet and human
rights and gave Jiang's responses.
</P>
<P>
   The 7 p.m. news showed brief, bland segments of each president's
opening remarks, and a picture of the American reporter asking the
question on dissidents _ with the sound deleted. A 9 p.m. ``special
report'' carried a five-minute account of the state banquet this
evening, followed by a two-minute segment on trains.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, some interesting television was lost. At the end
of the live mid-day broadcast, the CCTV anchor for what had been
scheduled as a 15-minute news conference but turned into a major
impromptu political debate, came up with a most fitting epilogue:
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that to communicate with each other takes time,'' he
said, adding, ``Anyhow, face to face is better than back to back.''

COMPANIES REACT QUICKLY TO COURT'S SEXUAL HARASSMENT RULINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (subs for editorial fine-tuning throughout, and addition of Kilberg
quote)  (nk) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the U.S. Supreme Court creating a new national policy on
sexual harassment virtually overnight, many companies are moving
quickly to re-examine their rules, expecting to adopt tougher
measures to meet the court's standards.
</P>
<P>
   Most large corporations have strong harassment policies, but
human resource experts said that a weak link in those programs was
usually the companies' failure to repeatedly communicate the policy
to all employees or to have effective mechanisms set up for
employees to report harassment without fear of reprisals.
</P>
<P>
   Executives, lawyers and consultants specializing in human
resources predicted that medium-size and smaller companies with
inadequate human resources staffs would have to do the most to
strengthen their anti-harassment policies.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the court's two far-reaching decisions Friday came
quickly. Corporations from Nabisco to Lockheed-Martin were set to
review their policies, corporate executives and advisers said, in
view of the court's holding that employers will face broader
exposure for sexual harassment by supervisors, especially if the
employers do not have strong anti-harassment programs.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bernstein, a lawyer in Newark, N.J., who advises RJ
Reynolds and Continental Airlines on employment matters, said: ``In
light of these opinions, I'm telling my clients that the Supreme
Court is saying that if you want to minimize your liability, if you
want to insulate yourself, then establish clear policies,
distribute them among you work force. Make sure you can establish
that your employees have received your policies and your complaint
procedures and that they know precisely who it is they're supposed
to complain to.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't limited to sexual harassment,'' Bernstein said.
``The same general principles apply to claims of homosexual
harassment, racial harassment and national-origin harassment. This
is the perfect opportunity for employers to seize the day and
educate employees to their policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepping into a field that had been marked by confusion, the
Supreme Court expanded potential liability for harassment by ruling
that employers could be held liable when a supervisor threatened to
demote or take other action against an employee who refused the
supervisor's sexual demands, even when the threats were not carried
out.
</P>
<P>
   But the court's majority wrote in the pair of 7-2 decisions that
employers could generally avoid liability in such cases by showing
that they had strong anti-harassment programs. In particular, the
rulings suggested that employers make sure they communicate those
policies to all employees and establish systems for receiving and
reviewing harassment complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours after the decisions were issued, corporate counsels
and employment lawyers were poring over the opinions to figure out
exactly how to advise their companies and clients, against the
backdrop of the large-scale sexual harassment settlements agreed to
by corporate giants like Smith Barney and Mitsubishi.
</P>
<P>
   In Mitsubishi's case, the corporation agreed to pay $34 million
to settle a sexual harassment case brought by women working at a
factory in Illinois. Smith Barney, in a proposed settlement, agreed
to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to women who said they had
been harassed and to spend $15 million on anti-discrimination and
anti-harassment training.
</P>
<P>
   Employment experts predicted that the ruling would drum up a lot
of business for consultants who advise companies on sexual
harassment. They said they also expected that tens of thousands of
human resources officials and senior executives would soon begin
fashioning their policies to reduce the chance of liability in
which plaintiffs often win hundreds of thousands and even millions
of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Water cooler discussions about harassment will now shift to
boardroom discussions about harassment,'' said Susan Meisinger,
senior vice president for the Society for Human Resource
Management, an association of more than 100,000 personnel and
employee relations professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law of sexual harassment is an area of shifting sands,''
she added. ``Each time that there's this evolution, employers have
to go back and check their practices to make sure they're not going
to get themselves in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Just hours after the decisions were issued, corporate counsels
and employment lawyers were reading and re-reading the opinions to
figure out exactly how to advise their companies and clients. With
companies eager to avoid the large-scale sexual harassment
settlements agreed to by corporate giants like Smith Barney and
Mitsubishi, several employment experts predicted that the ruling
would drum up a lot of business for consultants who advise
companies on sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Conrad, senior vice president for litigation at the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce, said the group would soon advise the Chamber's
200,000 members, 90 percent of which have fewer than 100 employees,
on the effect of the ruling. ``After these decisions, we'll be
telling people there are things you can do to prevent this from
happening and to protect yourself in the process, '' she said.
``Have a policy and effectively communicate it. Promptly
investigate complaints. And take prompt corrective action.''

<P>
   In one of the two Supreme Court cases, a former lifeguard sued
the City of Boca Raton, Fla., complaining that two male supervisors
had created a sexually hostile atmosphere for years through
offensive touching and lewd remarks. Even though the city had a
formal anti-harassment policy, the court found the city liable,
noting that Boca Raton had failed to disseminate the policy to the
beach employees.
</P>
<P>
   The court also faulted Boca Raton for making no effort to keep
track of the supervisors' conduct and for not making clear that
employees could bypass the harassing supervisors if they wanted to
file complaints.
</P>
<P>
   In the other case, an employee of Burlington Industries sued the
company, saying she felt compelled to quit after a supervisor had
said he could make life harder or easier for her depending on
whether she did such things as wear shorter skirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employers are going to pay attention to these decisions,''
said Angela DeSilva, chief counsel for the Duke Energy Corp. in
Houston. ``Most employers should be paying attention to this to be
sure they're not behind on this issue. They should go back and
analyze whether they have a policy and analyze whether they're
effectively disseminating the policy. If you have an employer who
has a policy that's kept in the HR department and that's not
disseminated to employees, it's not going to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Several human resource experts interviewed after the Supreme
Court issued its ruling said most large corporations have strong
sexual harassment policies. These experts said that if there is any
weak link in those programs, it is usually that the companies do
not repeatedly communicate the policy to all employees or do not
have a effective mechanism set up for employees to report
harassment without fear of reprisals.
</P>
<P>
   At some companies, executives voiced confidence that they had
tough harassment policies that would help protect them against
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nabisco already has a strong sexual harassment policy in
place,'' said Barbara Sellinger, the company's chief labor and
chief litigation counsel. ``You'll probably find that the larger
companies are in really good shape. The medium-sized and smaller
companies that don't have a good human resources staff are not
going to be in good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, she said Nabisco executives would certainly review
the court's decisions to make sure the company heeded the criteria
set forth to avoid liability.
</P>
<P>
   In its rulings, the Supreme Court analyzed three situations and
types of sexual harassment. In one, often called quid pro quo
harassment, the supervisor takes an adverse action _ like
dismissal, failing to promote, reducing benefits or reassigning
with significantly reduced responsibilities _ against an employee
who refuses to submit to the supervisor's sexual demands. In such
cases, the court wrote, affirming a long-standing line of cases,
that the employer was automatically liable, even when it had a
strong anti-harassment policy in place.
</P>
<P>
   In the second situation, generally called a hostile work
environment case, there is a sexually hostile environment, marked
by severe or pervasive conduct. In the third situation, a
supervisor threatens a tangible job detriment, like a demotion, to
someone who spurns the supervisor's advances, but the threat goes
unfulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled that in these two situations the employer could
be held liable for the harassment, but could escape liability by
proving that it had ``exercised reasonable care to prevent and
correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled further that employers could also avoid
liability by showing that the employee asserting harassment
``unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or
corrective opportunities provided by the employer.''
</P>
<P>
   Invoking such a defense, employers would argue that it would be
wrong to hold them liable because an employee was unreasonable in
failing to complain to higher-ups and thus did not give the
employer the chance to correct the behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``These decisions give employers a road map,'' said William
Kilberg, a lawyer in Washington who wrote a brief in the case for
the National Association of Manufacturers. ``You have to have a
policy and then regularly remind people of its existence. And you
should create some easy mechanism, like a hot line, for employees
to file complaints. Arguably, if Boca Raton had a hot line that
went to City Hall or to someone in the human resources department
and if they had then investigated, then the city would not have
been held liable.''
</P>
<P>
   While corporate officials applauded the rulings because they
drew clear lines about what to do to avoid liability, plaintiffs'
lawyers and women's groups also praised the decisions for holding
that employers faced liability for harassment by supervisors, even
when there was no tangible adverse job action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does a very smart thing,'' said Martha Davis, legal
director for the National Organization for Women Legal Education
and Defense Fund. ``It continues to make sure that employers bear
the burden rather than the individual if harm is done.
</P>
<P>
   The lifeguard who sued, Beth Ann Faragher, who is now a lawyer
in Denver, said in an interview, ``This was an argument about
principle and is a victory for working women because it tells their
employers they must take affirmative steps to prevent'' harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meisinger of the Society for Human Resource Management,
recommended that employers consider buying insurance against sexual
harassment cases. She said: ``The math has changed a bit. These two
decisions are the culmination of a public focus on the subject, and
employers have to anticipate the cumulative impact of this will be
more litigation.''

 &HT;    Ailing sisters home from hospital
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Dan and Melissa Dooley are low-key people. Only a
small yellow ribbon tied in a bow and attached to a tall green
shrub near their driveway hints at their ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   The Dooleys brought their two daughters, Mary Beth, 6, and Anna,
2, back home Friday from a long brush with death.
</P>
<P>
   The two girls fell gravely ill with E. coli 0157:H7 in early
June and spent three harrowing weeks in Egleston Children's
Hospital. Their kidneys failed and they underwent dialysis; doctors
gave them so many blood transfusions their parents lost track.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday evening, as family and friends gathered at the
Dooleys'home in the Hull community of Madison County, both girls
were darting around as though they had never been ill. They played
with dozens of balloons and stuffed animals.
</P>
<P>
   Dooley said the girls' physician at Egleston had planned to
release them Thursday but decided to wait until Friday so both
could have one more blood transfusion.
</P>
<P>
   The girls suffered complete kidney failure at the height of the
infection and had to be placed on kidney dialysis machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had good days and bad days,'' said Melissa Dooley, 35,
who stayed at the hospital almost full time and took turns visiting
one daughter's room or the other's. Dooley, 39, split time between
the hospital and his CPA business in Hull. And the Dooleys'
parents, sisters and friends also took turns at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``The girls knew something was wrong,'' Mrs. Dooley said, ``but
they were too young to know how terribly wrong. We gave them a lot
of love. That's all you can do.''
</P>
<P>
   She knew her daughters had finally turned a corner only a few
days ago, when doctors removed them from dialysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart goes out to all those parents whose children have E.
coli,'' she said, ``because it is so scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Dooley said that physicians told him that his daughters' cases
were evidently isolated, unrelated to an earlier case of E. coli in
a Danielsville Elementary School student, who apparently contracted
it from a contaminated beef patty in the school cafeteria. That
child was released from a hospital May 9, and the Dooley children
did not fall ill until June.
</P>
<P>
   Nor had either girl been to White Water Park, as had the other
children who've become ill, Dooley said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dooleys said the love and support of family and friends
helped get them through the ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got more friends than we knew we had,'' Dooley said.
``They sent a lot of love and said a lot of prayers for our
children.''

 &HT;    Mothers against microbes
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   They shared a similar boyhood dream.
</P>
<P>
   One wanted to be a doctor, tending to critically ill children.
The other wanted to deliver the sick and wounded to the emergency
room door.
</P>
<P>
   But they also shared a nightmare named E. coli O157:H7.
</P>
<P>
   Today, one boy steps purposefully toward college. The other
blazes through the playground, red hair flying, running through
recess forever.
</P>
<P>
   Damion Heersink carries himself with the reserved enthusiasm of
an eldest son and big brother who's finally breaking free from
parents and little brothers and a sister. Visiting Atlanta, he
lunges at the opportunity to navigate his mom around his
soon-to-be-adopted big city, more than four hours from his Dothan,
Ala., home. Yet he admits to missing his toddler twin brothers when
a baby's shriek rings out in a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   This August, at Atlanta's Emory University, Damion hopes his
doctor dreams take flight. He wants pre-med courses, then the long
haul of medical school, to lead him back to the hospital. Back to
where doctors and nurses and the constant vigil of his parents kept
him alive as his body battled the ravages of a toxin picked up
during a Boy Scout cookout.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to be like Dr. Daniel Plasencia, a pediatric specialist
who guided Damion's 1992 roller-coaster ride through E. coli hell
at Tampa's St. Joseph's Children's Hospital. Plasencia led the
crisis management of kidney, heart and lung experts who battled the
constant complications of the killer microbe: E. coli O157:H7.
</P>
<P>
   Damion suffered from hemolytic uremic syndrome, or HUS, the same
kidney and blood disruption affecting seriously ill children in
Georgia's rush of E. coli cases. Because of his age, 11, he also
battled an adult version of the kidney and blood malfunction. This
bacteria has proved to be unlike any other in its tenacity and
toxicity. All doctors can do is keep patients alive until their
bodies fight off the poison.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was when I was in the hospital that I decided I wanted to
be a doctor, to help kids get through what I almost didn't get
through,'' says Damion, now 18.
</P>
<P>
   Seven times in seven weeks as he was wheeled into surgery,
through March and April 1992, his mom, Mary Heersink, told her
first born good-bye.
</P>
<P>
   His kidneys failed, his lungs turned to soup, his intestine
ruptured, his own blood turned against him. Tubes in his mouth,
nose, chest and bladder linked to breathing machines and nutrition
and drainage devices kept him alive. Doctors repeatedly drained the
fluids around Damion's heart that threatened to suffocate him. But
it had to be done without anesthesia because his compromised body
couldn't handle the sedative.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to talk because of a respirator in place for four weeks,
Damion frantically scribbled notes to his mom. ``Please, Stop Them
From Stabbing Me'' read one when the long needle plunged into his
heart. ``Please, today?'' read another, which had become shorthand
for his eternal request for any liquid, preferably a taste, a sip,
of his favorite drink: a strawberry Slurpee.
</P>
<P>
   Though doctors had forbidden liquids, Mary Heersink finally gave
in. Damion took one sip. Instantly, he writhed in pain. Nurses
rushed Damion to the operating room, where doctors sliced him open
from throat to groin to remove 26-feet of looping and coiling
intestinal tract to search for holes.
</P>
<P>
   Damion suffered the most serious complications of E. coli
O157:H7, a bacteria that has sickened nine Georgia children and
four others from out of state. Two of those children are in
critical condition. The bacteria lives in the intestines of cattle,
and is released in cattle feces. It sometimes hitchhikes its way
into the food supply, primarily on ground beef, but E. coli
outbreaks also have been associated with unpasteurized apple juice
and milk, fruits and vegetables. According to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, this particular E. coli strain
sickens 20,000 Americans, killing about 500 yearly.
</P>
<P>
   Although the strange name is now become part of the lexicon of
potential deadly poisons lurking in our food supply, in 1992, the
Heersinks _ like most Americans _ had never heard of it.
</P>
<P>
   When doctors surmised Damion had contracted the tiny, invisible
bacteria from eating beef _ his mother was dumbstruck.
</P>
<P>
   ``How on earth could this have happened?'' she remembers
thinking. ``The meat industry and the Department of Agriculture
knew very well about this bug back then. But no one ever told us
the rules had changed about how you approach eating beef.''
</P>
<P>
   One year later, Nancy Donley asked the same question.
</P>
<P>
   Her 6-year-old boy was dead from eating a grilled hamburger
patty.
</P>
<P>
   She wanted a simple answer to a simple question: Why?
</P>
<P>
   In four days, E. coli: O157 had coursed through her only child's
tiny body with a voracity that shocked even the doctors at
Chicago's Children's Memorial Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to donate Alex's organs, but we couldn't,'' Nancy
Donley says. ``E. coli destroyed every single organ. The autopsy
showed it even liquefied portions of his brain.''
</P>
<P>
   When the two mothers united in 1993 to demand safer meat, they
discovered the answers to the why, how and whens of their sons'
illnesses were anything but simple. The query led everywhere and
nowhere: to consumers blamed for not thoroughly cooking their beef;
to public health officials doing at poor job at communicating risk;
and to the historically weak federal regulation of the nation's
slaughterhouses and meat-packing plants.
</P>
<P>
   It took the Jack in the Box outbreak of E. coli, which killed
four children and sickened hundreds in the Northwest in 1993, for
the rest of America to get this same crash course on microbes,
meat, public policy and the power of private industry.
</P>
<P>
   Like Heersink and Donley, more mothers, fathers and E. coli
survivors met and instantly bonded. They formed Safe Tables Our
Priority, or S.T.O. P. It's now a national group with 5,000
members, a victim hotline, and a tiny Brooklyn-based office headed
by a diligent researcher and spokesperson named Heather Klinkhamer.
When clusters of cases occur, S.T.O.P. members contact victims'
families, offering support and information, as Heersink did this
week in the Georgia cases.
</P>
<P>
   The group has been praised by President Clinton and his wife,
Hillary, and has been invited to international summits on food
safety. It sits on national meat-safety advisory boards, and swoops
onto the information-networking scene during every E. coli
outbreak, from Tokyo to Tennessee. S.T.O.P. is the the citizens'
force credited to last year's recall of 25 million pounds of Hudson
beef that had been traced to 17 serious illnesses in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made it a personal issue,'' says Dr. Robert Tauxe, chief
of the CDC's foodborne disease branch. ``The activities of Ms.
Heersink and the S.T.O.P. group began a pivotal transformation of
the Department of Agriculture and the safety of meat.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the documentation and epidemiological reports
proving the threat of this invisible food microbe didn't exist, the
word just hadn't gotten beyond the often insular office walls of
researchers and doctors.
</P>
<P>
   According to a former USDA assistant secretary, S.T.O.P. has
been one of the most successful grass-roots groups to ever get the
ear _ and action _ of Congress. Through old-fashioned lobbying and
committee hearing testimonials, S.T.O.P. shook loose the meat
industry that had been immune to government intervention for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   It's biggest accomplishment: Getting federal testing, safety and
recall regulations imposed upon E. coli O157:H7. Previously, a
discovery of contaminated meat was met with ``be sure to cook your
meat'' refrains from meat distributors, who claimed the
contamination of this new, lethal bacteria was inevitable and
unavoidable in the farm-to-table chain.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if the bacteria is discovered in meat after it's
distributed, the batch of beef receives a federal government
warning and most often is voluntarily recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been constantly and emotionally moved by the way
they've worked together and what they've accomplished,'' said Carol
Tucker Foreman, assistant USDA secretary from 1977 to 1981, who now
heads the advocacy group, Safe Food Coalition, in Washington, D.C.
``They have been extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Heersink, Donley and other S.T.O.P. members are also credited
with demanding a better public health tracking of E. coli-related
infections, and a computerized tracking system for foodborne
outbreaks. Those systems, monitored by the CDC and state public
health departments, have helped pinpoint the extent of the Georgia
outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, while pregnant with twin boys, Mary Heersink wrote the
personal account of her son's illness, a 300-page book she gladly
gives away to families entering E. coli hell. It's been translated
into several languages, including Japanese, where it became a
best-seller following that country's E. coli O157 outbreak that
killed 11 people and sickened nearly 10,000 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The book is simply called ``E. Coli O157: The True Story of a
Mother's Battle With A Killer Microbe.'' She dedicated it to 13
children _ none of them older than 7 years old _ all of them dead
from E. coli O157.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a group that promotes vegetarianism, though Heersink
and Donley don't eat ground beef. They also do not mince words over
the mincing and mixing practices of the beef industry.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, when a small meat processor told the Secretary of
Agriculture that new proposed USDA safety regulations were costly
and seemed excessive, Mary Donley shot back: ``You're really just
saying that it is inconvenient for you to make the change to assure
your product isn't contaminated. Well, let me tell you. It wasn't
convenient for me to have my son die.''
</P>
<P>
   USDA Secretary Dan Glickman refers to Heersink and Donley as
modern-day Upton Sinclairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``S.T.O.P. has turned the tide on food safety,'' Glickman said
on Jan. 18, 1998, the fifth anniversary of the Jack in the Box
outbreak. ``You have become a powerful, morally unstoppable force
for change. . . . Never, ever stop.''
</P>
<P>
   The meat industry, however, is a less complimentary. ``They're
very well-meaning, but it's a little bit like asking MADD to write
laws to make sure people don't go drinking and driving,'' said
Rosemary Mucklow, executive director of the National Meat
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Heersink and Nancy Donley share a sense of mission that
takes them from tough-as-nails testimonial rhetoric to a mother's
empathetic ``I've been in that ICU-waiting room'' tears.
</P>
<P>
   In the trenches for six years now, Heersink, 43, admits to
wanting to devote more time to her six children, particularly
Damion's younger siblings, ages 2 1/2 to 16. She needs to return to
her suburban ``mom'' things in her 65,000-population town:
attending basketball and soccer games, tending to tree houses,
gathering every night over dinner and the family prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to gracefully back out,'' she says one minute while
untangling her twin boys' fingers from her long hair. But the next
minute, she is fielding reporters' calls on her cellular phone,
revving up the fax machine, packaging material to send to worried
parents sitting in Atlanta ICU waiting rooms.
</P>
<P>
   She always makes it a point to express the gratitude of the good
fortune of her outcome, one she says was aided by her physician
husband, Marnix Heersink, knowing how to navigate hospital protocol
and treatment therapies, and a plasma-transfer procedure that
cleansed Damion's blood.
</P>
<P>
   It is a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   It is a burden.
</P>
<P>
   One her lanky 6-foot-4 adolescent son is just realizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he senses a huge responsibility to these kids who have
died,'' she says. ``He's a voice for children that have been
silenced.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Donley will never know where the
``what-I-want-to-be-when-I-grow-up'' jabber of her little redhead
would have led.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called him my little monkey-boy. I don't know know why. I
guess he was always climbing around being a typical little boy,''
she says. ``He wanted to be a paramedic. He was always there to
help people, even asking how they were doing when he came into a
room. He was very unusual in that way, how he didn't just think of
himself. And he was only 6, just graduated kindergarten.''
</P>
<P>
   If Alex were alive today, he'd be 11 years old, the same age as
Damion Heersink when he suddenly developed a bad case of diarrhea
on his way to a Florida space camp.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy, 43, a real estate agent, says she and her husband, Tom,
only wanted one child, and they haven't changed their mind in the
years since losing sparkly-eyed Alexander Thomas on July 18, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had Alex and he was perfection and we decided to stop at
perfection,'' she says quietly yet forcefully. ``He was everything
we wanted in a child. It just doesn't seem right to have another.''

 &HT;    Family's reason for cooperation spurs speculation
 &HT;    By Craig Schneider
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- When John and Patsy Ramsey hired lawyers after their
daughter, JonBenet, was killed and then distanced themselves from
police, it didn't sit right with Nancy Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that they did not work with police from the beginning
led me and my family to place a cloud of suspicion over the
family,'' said Gordon, an Acworth schoolteacher and mother of
three.
</P>
<P>
   So when the Ramseys had three days of interviews last week with
investigators from the district attorney's office, Gordon wondered,
``Why the wait? What has changed? If they have nothing to hide,
they have nothing to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   But Susan Gordy of Atlanta said the Ramseys' stated reason for
waiting makes sense. The Ramseys say they broke off talks with the
police 14 months ago because they felt the police were out to get
them, said their attorney Hal Haddon. They waited for the case to
be handed over this month to the district attorney, whom they
trusted more, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'd be talking either,'' said Gordy. ``Everybody
kind of jumped on them in the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ramsey interviews arrive as Boulder, Colo., District
Attorney Alex Hunter decides whether to take the case to a grand
jury. After conducting full-day sessions of videotaped interviews
Tuesday through Thursday, Hunter said he is leaning toward
convening a grand jury. Recent developments, he said, might delay
his decision beyond his original early July estimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. and Mrs. Ramsey have been cooperative,'' said Hunter, who
declined to discuss the specifics of the conversations held in
Colorado, except to say the family handed over some important
documents. Their 11-year-old son, Burke, also was interviewed over
three days in Atlanta, where the family now resides.
</P>
<P>
   Burke was in the family's Boulder home when 6-year-old JonBenet
was found beaten and strangled Dec. 26, 1996. While his parents are
among those under ``an umbrella of suspicion,'' police say the boy
is not a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say the interviews allowed the family and
authorities to feel out each other. Denver legal analyst Andrew
Cohen said he also sees some posturing for the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ramseys can say, `The cops were incompetent, so much so
that we didn't want to talk to them. As soon as the case went to
the district attorney, we did go in,''' said Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   Haddon, the Ramsey attorney, said the family's communication
with the district attorney actually began over a year ago and
included handing over records regarding medical, phone, bank and
business matters. John and Patsy Ramsey were interviewed
simultaneously in separate rooms last week, each accompanied by an
attorney and a private investigator, and no restrictions were
placed on the questioning. The only condition demanded by the
Ramseys was that ``police not be in the room,'' said Suzanne
Laurion, a district attorney spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The interviews can have benefits for both the investigators and
the Ramseys, said Christopher Mueller, a law professor at the
University of Colorado. The investigators can probe the family
members' knowledge and look for any important inconsistencies in
their stories. A family member can, if innocent, offer more tidbits
to help the probe and, if guilty, persuasively lie to prevent a
prosecution, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may be posturing; they may be trying to help,'' Mueller
said.

TEXAS DEMS WARNED: PARTY FACES EXTINCTION IF LOSES STATE ELECTIONS &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    (Eds: optional trim)
 &HT;    By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Democratic attorney general nominee Jim Mattox,
who resurrected his political career this year, sternly warned the
Texas Democratic Convention Saturday that the party will be near
extinction if it loses this year's statewide elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most important convention in modern times because
if we do not leave here united ... we will lose these statewide
elections and will become irrelevant for the next 20 years,''
Mattox said. ``We can't allow that to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The convention ended Saturday with the Democrats vowing to turn
the tide that led to major election defeats in 1994 and 1996. As
the Democrats organized for the fall elections, they elected their
first woman as party leader, former Republican Molly Beth Malcolm
of Texarkana.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the convention's speakers served as cheerleaders at a
pep rally, playing down their party's uphill battle against the
popularity of Republican Gov. George W. Bush and the apathy of
voters caused by the state's good economy. But Mattox gave the
convention a stiff slap in the face.
</P>
<P>
   Mattox said Republican U.S. Sen. Phil Gramm was right two weeks
ago when he predicted that if Republicans sweep statewide this year
that dinosaurs will walk the earth before a Democrat wins the
governor's office again. Mattox said only 43 percent of the state's
voters identify themselves as Democrats and that is not enough to
win an election.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're to have a new majority for this Democratic Party, we
must reach out and find practical, pragmatic individuals who are
not looking just at ideology,'' Mattox said. ``They are looking for
creative ways to solve the problems we face.''
</P>
<P>
   Mattox, who has been considered one of Texas' most liberal
politicians over the past three decades, told the convention that
Democrats ``cannot worship at the altar of the New Deal any longer
... . We must look to the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Mattox said he finds it ``gratifying'' to once again be in a
party leadership role just four years after many observers declared
him politically dead.
</P>
<P>
   Mattox was attorney general from 1983-90, but after his loss to
Ann Richards in the brutal 1990 gubernatorial primary many
Democrats were intent on driving Mattox out of politics.
</P>
<P>
   Richards pressured party leaders to keep Mattox out of the 1993
U.S. Senate special election, and the following year Mattox lost
the Democratic primary for the Senate nomination to millionaire
Richard Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, before the primary, some party leaders tried to find
a major opponent for Mattox in the attorney general's race but gave
up when then-Houston Mayor Bob Lanier turned them down. In the
latest Texas Poll, Mattox was the Democrat with the highest level
of voter support for the November general election, leading
Republican John Cornyn 44 percent to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While Mattox emphasized the need for party unity, gubernatorial
candidate Garry Mauro tried to dissipate a perception that
Democratic elected officials are shunning his campaign. About 150
Democratic elected officials and candidates joined Mauro on the
convention's main stage in a display of support.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Texas Poll showed Mauro trailing Bush by more than 50
percentage points. Democratic Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock and dozens of
other Democratic office holders have endorsed Bush in the past
year. And Democratic lieutenant governor candidate John Sharp and
comptroller candidate Paul Hobby have distanced themselves from
Mauro's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm 30 points down, they're not going to be real gung ho
about campaigning with me,'' Mauro said. ``But when I'm three
points up, they'll all be there.''
</P>
<P>
   The convention adopted a party platform that largely reflected
Mauro's campaign agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The platform called for adoption of a constitutional amendment
to ban the sales tax from being extended to groceries and medicine.
It also demanded a Patient's bill of rights to require that health
maintenance organizations give their customers total freedom to
choose their own doctors.
</P>
<P>
   While the platform supported abortion rights in general, it did
not address the issue of whether to notify parents before giving a
minor an abortion. Outgoing party Chairman Bill White said that was
left out because Democrats were not united on the issue.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the Republican convention earlier this month, Bush promised
to make passage of a parental notification law a ``key'' priority
of his next administration if he is re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   The convention also heard speeches Saturday from land
commissioner nominee Richard Raymond, agriculture commissioner
nominee Pete Patterson and Railroad Commission nominee Joe
Henderson, as well as Houston Mayor Lee Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Repeating the themes of his own campaign last year, Brown
emphasized cultural diversity and government programs aimed at
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best and most effective government is the one that puts
people first,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his statement last week that he would address the
convention in a nonpartisan role, Brown joined the partisan
cheerleading by urging the delegates to go home and organize their
party's voters. ``We must get our voters to the polls,'' he said,
after asserting that nation is on an upswing because of President
Clinton.

NOWITZKI WILL VISIT DALLAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Dallas Mavericks have persuaded first-round draft pick Dirk
Nowitzki of Germany to come to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   How long he stays, however, is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Though Nowitzki said yesterday that he is leaning toward staying
in Germany for two years before coming to the NBA, the Mavericks
are flying him to Dallas today for a red-carpet tour of the city
aimed at persuading him to play here next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'm ready for the NBA yet, but they are trying
to convince me,'' said the 20-year-old Nowitzki, who was measured
at 7 feet tall during a private workout for Mavericks coach/general
manager Don Nelson, assistant coach Donnie Nelson and owner Ross
Perot Jr. on Friday in Wurzburg. ``I think I want to stay here for
a year or maybe two, but it's still up in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks, who engineered a three-team trade to acquire
Nowitzki and point guard Steve Nash in the NBA draft Wednesday, are
encouraged that he will visit Dallas and that his father, Jorg,
told his son yesterday to ``seize the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks have agreed to let Nowitzki pursue his dream of
playing for Germany in the 2000 Olympics, allowing him to leave the
team for four-day periods in November and February 1999 to play in
qualification games. Nowitzki, who said he is ``too weak'' to play
on the world's ultimate playground, must believe that he will
receive significant playing time in Dallas and that the NBA's
probable lockout Wednesday will not severely stunt his basketball
development.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Mavericks can't offer as much money as the four
European teams competing for his services, Nowitzki said yesterday
money will not be the deciding factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money is not important,'' said Nowitzki, who has offers of $2
million tax-free from teams in Spain and Italy, while the Mavericks
are limited to offering $1.3 million for next season. ``I've been
surprised by the Mavericks' visit and them wanting me to return
with them. I am very interested.''
</P>
<P>
   In what Donnie Nelson called ``the biggest recruiting trip in
team history,'' the Mavericks will introduce Nowitzki to Nash and
Mavericks star Michael Finley tomorrow morning, take him to one of
the team's basketball clinics for children and escort him on a tour
of Fort Worth-Dallas, including the site for the new arena.
Nowitzki, who can't sign a contract before Wednesday but could
agree in principle to play in Dallas next season, is scheduled to
leave Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Don Nelson called Nowitzki ``one of the best players I've ever
seen,'' and Donnie Nelson echoed that praise yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got special, special skills for a guy his size,'' said
Donnie, who coached Nowitzki during his 33-point, 14-rebound
performance in a game against U.S. high school players in March in
San Antonio. ``I'm not saying he'll be an All-Star because a lot of
different factors go into that. But when he comes into his own,
he'll be one of best, most versatile players in the league.''

NAACP GATHERING DENOUNCES KLAN AND PANTHERS IN JASPER 
 

</HEADLINE>

By T.J. MILLING

<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER _ While protesters hurled racial epithets across the town
square Saturday, a small group of black officials and area
residents gathered in a funeral home chapel and sang the old civil
rights hymn We Shall Overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Swaying to the music in the very room of Robinson's Funeral Home
where James Byrd Jr.'s torn body once lay, they sang the words,
``Black and white together, we shall overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   The gathering of about 30 locals and officials of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People was at times
emotional but free of the divisive rhetoric in front of the county
courthouse, where a Ku Klux Klan rally had drawn about 50 black
protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Diggles, an African-American who heads an East Texas
economic development council, denounced both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both are wrong,'' he said, ``the Klan and the Panthers.'' He
lauded the Byrd family for its public plea for racial
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing over there at the courthouse is the worst in
people, and what we're seeing here is the best in people,'' added
Mike Bradford, the U.S. attorney from Beaumont, who came to inform
the group and hear complaints. ``This is what we need to be
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, mostly with blacks but including a few whites, was
one of a series the NAACP plans to hold here to gather information
and monitor the prosecution of the three white men accused of
dragging Byrd to death behind a pickup, dismembering him in the
process. Bradford said the investigation is nearing completion and
either state capital murder charges or federal civil rights charges
could be filed within a month.
</P>
<P>
   At present, Shawn Berry, Bill King and Russell Brewer Jr. are
charged in the case. Officials have said they will pursue the death
penalty against at least two of the men.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bledsoe, president of the state conference of NAACP
branches, called for a task force to investigate hate groups in
prison. King and Brewer have possible links to white supremacist
prison gangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very concerned about what's going on in prison, people
becoming more hardened,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford, who said he updates U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno
daily on the case, pledged to spare no expense to conclude the
investigation quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening over at the courthouse today,'' he explained,
``is reason why we don't want this lingering.''

Column: England's passion is a national curse
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DALE ROBERTSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LONDON _ Wimbledon is a local institution, the mother church of
tennis. It is venerated by the Brits, whose circadian clocks are
set by the arrival of the fortnight.
</P>
<P>
   If the strawberries and cream are being served up on Church
Road, SW 19, then it must be summer. Even if it feels like the dead
of winter, which it did early Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   But soccer, nonetheless, is the English religion. And, head up
against the World Cup, lawn tennis takes a dusting.
</P>
<P>
   When England beat Colombia on Friday night to advance to the
World Cup's Sweet 16, Steffi Graf's loss to Natasha Zvereva became
a minor event. You had to dig through nine pages of World Cup
coverage in the Times and the Sun _ two newspapers at opposite ends
of the taste and sophistication spectrum _ to find a word about the
seven-time champion being ousted in the third round by a woman she
had defeated 17 times in a row.
</P>
<P>
   But had England's on-the-brink lads succumbed, oh boy. There
wouldn't have been enough ink to properly dissect the depth and
breadth of the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   The Brits' last _ and only _ World Cup title came 32 years ago,
on the sacred sod at Wembley. It remains unlikely the current team
will stage a repeat on French soil, but that doesn't deter a doting
populace from daring to dream on. England gave soccer to the world
_ as well as the word ``soccer,'' from ASSOCiation Football _ and
hope springs eternal England will reclaim its birthright.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer team, economy booming
</P>
<P>
   The Lions' failures on the pitch long have been a symbol of the
national malaise. Now, with the country's economy in the midst of a
solid recovery, with London booming like never before in modern
times, it's hoped the footballers can find it within them to follow
suit.
</P>
<P>
   The TV audience for the Colombia game was estimated at 20
million. Friday evening, the usually snarled West End traffic had
thinned appreciably. Only mad dogs and American tourists wandered
about.
</P>
<P>
   Next up are the Argentines, in Saint-Etienne on Tuesday. The
Falklands War was a minor skirmish compared to the consequences of
this rematch.
</P>
<P>
   How seriously do the Brits take soccer? Kasey Keller, the
American-born U.S. team goalkeeper who plays in England's Premier
League, has at least a dozen documented namesakes in South London.
Such was his popularity when he starred for Millwall, possibly the
most rabid and rowdy of all soccer neighborhoods, that babies were
being christened Kasey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys and girls,'' Keller's wife said.
</P>
<P>
   At Arsenal's home stadium, in East London, there hangs a sign:
``Welcome to Highbury, The Home of Football.'' And it is. The
Gunners _ pronounced Gooners _ have a global following after 77
unbroken years of Premier League play. With a high percentage of
fans who really are fans, not beer-swilling cretins with tattoos
and shaved heads pretending to be fans, Arsenal long has stood as a
symbol of what's good about English soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, England always can be counted on to show a
different side, its ugly side, on the World Cup platform. France's
easy access has left it vulnerable to invasion by the drunken louts
known locally as ``yobs.'' Despite a virtual garrison of French
security police, the English ``supporters'' outdid themselves in
and around Lens before the Colombia match. As the Times' banner
headline noted: ``England win marred by 489 arrests.''
</P>
<P>
   With team comes hooligans
</P>
<P>
   Although most of the notorious hooligans _ including one guy
with 27 convictions for violent behavior _ were turned back at
Calais and Le Havre, and a ban on liquor sales was enforced over
much of the area, chaos resulted.
</P>
<P>
   Some 500 Brits went on a rampage outside the stadium before the
game, pelting police and passers-by with beer bottles. In the
Belgian port of Ostend, shops and bars were looted by Brits, and
skirmishes between the gendarmes and hooligans erupted in Lille, 30
miles from Lens.
</P>
<P>
   A possibly worse situation is feared for Saint-Etienne, in
central France near Lyon, for the Argentina match. There would be
bad blood between the two teams without the Falklands squabble for
a backdrop because of Diego Maradona's questionable ``Hand of God''
goal that eliminated the English 2-1 in the 1986 quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   Revenge is being vowed by the morons who believe England's
``honor'' can be avenged with criminal behavior. It's a mystifying,
and terrifying phenomenon, for which there appears only one option:
Ban the Brits from the World Cup until the nonsense abates.
</P>
<P>
   That's hardly fair to the players and their legions of
legitimate backers, but it seems a logical response to ridiculous
behavior. Something must be done, and I suppose shooting the
rowdies on sight is a bit extreme.
</P>
<P>
   Then again

 &HT;    O'Donnell might join Blake, Justin in Bengals huddle
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Quarterback Neil O'Donnell has several career options
after being cut last week by the New York Jets in favor of Vinny
Testaverde.
</P>
<P>
   But early indications are that the eight-year veteran's best
chance to regain his starting status and a $2 million paycheck
probably is in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Bengals coach Bruce Coslet, concerned by the continuing downward
spiral of onetime Pro Bowl passer Jeff Blake, dealt for
Indianapolis backup Paul Justin during the spring to push his
incumbent starter.
</P>
<P>
   Despite problems in New York, O'Donnell would represent an even
bigger challenge for Blake and possibly an upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals, who offered Testaverde $2.5 million in the days
following his release by Baltimore, would dangle at least that much
for O'Donnell.
</P>
<P>
   There aren't many other suitors with sufficient salary-cap room
to lure O'Donnell, who also might be limited because he's
represented by agent Leigh Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the only other team that can rival the Bengals as far
as money and starter's opportunity is New Orleans, but Mike Ditka
seems satisfied for now with Billy Joe Hobert.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who wouldn't be interested (in O'Donnell)?'' Coslet asked.
``He's a tough guy, mentally and physically.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an experienced guy who's won.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell might be interested in Carolina, because of his
relationship with coach Dom Capers, but Steinberg represents
starter Kerry Collins there.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle had legitimate interest in Testaverde and probably will
in O'Donnell. But the Steinberg stable of clients includes Seahawks
quarterbacks Warren Moon and John Friesz.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Ryan Leaf is said to be struggling enough in San Diego
that GM Bobby Beathard could seek veteran help.
</P>
<P>
   But Steinberg has Leaf, plus the club is only about $800,000
under the spending limit and still must create cap room to sign its
rookies.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg associate David Dunn called the Bears to gauge
interest in O'Donnell, but Chicago would prefer to restructure the
contract of Rick Mirer and retain him as the backup to Erik Kramer.
</P>
<P>
   Raye of hope
</P>
<P>
   Despite his reputation as an offensive innovator, former Kansas
City coordinator Paul Hackett rarely allowed quarterbacks Elvis
Grbac and Rich Gannon to call audibles in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The moratorium contributed to a No. 24 ranking in the passing
game, center Tim Grunhard noted.
</P>
<P>
   Under new coordinator Jimmy Raye, quarterbacks will get more
freedom to check off at the line of scrimmage with the intent of
increasing the number of deep-ball opportunities for wideouts Andre
Rison and Derrick Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy alert
</P>
<P>
   With quarterback Dan Marino claiming that Troy Drayton is poised
for a breakthrough year, fantasy football owners might want to
consider the Miami tight end, who has enjoyed a standout offseason.
</P>
<P>
   In the offense redesigned by coach Jimmy Johnson and new
coordinator Kippy Brown, the five-year veteran won't be removed for
another wide receiver in third-down situations.
</P>
<P>
   In the last several seasons, Marino asked former coordinator
Gary Stevens to expand the role of the tight end.
</P>
<P>
   Among tight ends with 30 or more catches in '97, Drayton
averaged 14.3 yards, a figure topped by only Oakland's Ricky Dudley
(16.4 yards) and Shannon Sharpe of Denver (15.4).
</P>
<P>
   All in the family
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't have the makings of a Tom Clancy spy thriller, but
the latest chapter in the potential sale of the Minnesota Vikings
could create an intriguing twist.
</P>
<P>
   One of the suitors likely to make a bid for the franchise before
the July 1 deadline is Bruce Llewellyn, a New Jersey businessman
who has joined forces with former Vikes general manager Mike Lynn.
The irony is that Llewellyn is the father of Alexandra Llewellyn,
who will marry Clancy when his divorce from Wanda Clancy, his wife
of 29 years, becomes final.
</P>
<P>
   Llewellyn and Lynn a few months ago rejected an invitation to be
part of Clancy's bid, which then evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   It might have been an omen when Llewellyn took ill during a
meeting with commissioner Paul Tagliabue on Wednesday and had to be
hospitalized. Glen Taylor, who owns the NBA's Minnesota
Timberwolves, appears to be the front-runner to land the club.
</P>
<P>
   One who got away
</P>
<P>
   When Oakland Raiders pro scouting director George Karras
resigned last week, it marked the end of a 38-year career
bird-dogging for players at the college and pro levels.
</P>
<P>
   Karras didn't miss on too many prospects but conceded that he
failed to recognize potential in a skinny kid who served as
equipment manager during his term as assistant head coach at
Harvard in the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The nerdy-looking undergrad was Bill Gates, the founder of
Microsoft and now worth $51 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Fullback Craig Heyward reportedly was one of only two St. Louis
veterans to log zero appearances in the team's off-season
conditioning program. ... Second-year pro Marcellus Wiley has
looked good enough in Buffalo minicamps that coach Wade Phillips
will consider getting him solid playing time at left defensive end.
Phil Hansen would move inside to tackle in some situations. ...
</P>
<P>
   A pair of former FSU linebackers, Derrick Brooks (Tampa Bay) and
Henri Crockett (Atlanta), are entertaining 17 disadvantaged
youngsters here this weekend. ... Local agent Hadley Engelhard
again is trying to persuade Carolina officials to trade cornerback
Tyrone Poole, who has said he will not play for the Panthers. ...
Miami is shopping veteran defensive end Trace Armstrong around the
league. His original team, Chicago, has some interest, but Bears
coach Dave Wannstedt would prefer to sign free agent Tony Tolbert,
recently cut by Dallas. ...
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans defensive coordinator Zaven Yaralian, whose
aggressive scheme pushed his unit to a No. 4 overall ranking last
year, installed some new 3-4 fronts in a recent camp. ... The
line-thin Arizona Cardinals might take a chance on former Navy
offensive tackle Michael Wahle in the July 9 supplemental draft.
</P>
<P>
   The last word(s)
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis coach Dick Vermeil, asked whether the Rams might be
interested in troubled defensive end Alonzo Spellman, recently
released by Chicago:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I already take two Advil a day as it is.''

 &HT;    Waltrip is not done yet
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Just when many people in the racing world looked at
Darrell Waltrip and saw his Winston Cup career permanently a lap
down, he caught a caution.
</P>
<P>
   With an impressive sixth-place finish at Pocono, Waltrip
reminded us _ again _ that he wasn't done, wasn't gone.
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip led 10 laps late in the race. No fluke. Just a solid
outing when he needed it the most.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last couple of years, I have struggled with a lot of
things,'' the 51-year-old Waltrip said. ``I know my career is
running short. I'm not trying to live off my past. I think I bring
an awful lot to the table.''
</P>
<P>
   The man has a point. He has 84 Winston Cup victories, tied for
third with Bobby Allison on the all-time list; 59 poles, fourth
all-time; and three Winston Cup champonships. And he's the only
driver to win $500,000 or more in a season 18 times.
</P>
<P>
   But when Walthip's sponsorship evaporated, he did what most
honorable men do. He tried to keep his team together. Tried to keep
the people who were paying the bills happy. Tried to race. He
couldn't do any of them well.
</P>
<P>
   ``My racing was terrrible and I knew it was terrible,'' he said.
``I was down. I felt defeated. I felt like a loser. It was just the
worst of times. I came to the conclusion that the only way out was
to sell my team.''
</P>
<P>
   He did, to Tim Beverly, who loaned him to Dale Earnhardt, who
needed somebody to drive the No. 1 Pennzoil car while Steve Park
rehabiliated his broken leg.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly needed the time to get his new team up and running in
time for Walrtip to return for the Aug. 1 Brickyard 400.
</P>
<P>
   Everything's on schedule. Waltrip begins testing his old No. 17
car soon, putting his heart and soul into that endeavor, just as he
did in working with Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   And his performace at Pocono has gone far in restoring in him
what most believed was gone. Anyone who saw his postrace interview
had to be moved by his passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is big; this is big,'' Waltrip said, choking back tears.
``It has been so much fun, and I enjoy every minute of it. This is
my little oasis. The Lord was good to me. He saved me (when Beverly
came along) and gave me a little oasis, gave me time to catch my
breath and get my act back together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it's going to pay off in the long run. It won't be
too far away. I can win in this car (No.1). I knew I could a few
weeks ago. We ran hard. We raced 'em. They didn't drive by us. We
ran the best laps of the day when it counted, and that's all I care
about.''
</P>
<P>
   It was enough.

 &HT;    Shepherd McCall Pepsi 400 pick

<P>
   ATLANTA
</P>
<P>
   Winston cup
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Shepherd, who has served as fill-in driver for several
teams this year, will be behind the wheel of the No. 96 Caterpillar
Chevrolet for the Pepsi 400 night race at Daytona International
Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Shepherd wasn't Buzz McCall's first choice. Hut Stricklin was.
But Stricklin, who was fired from the No. 8 Stavola Brothers, is
under a one-race contract to drive a second Andy Petree entry in
the 400.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's excting to have the opportunity Buzz has given me,'' the
56-year-old Shepherd. ``I really didn't want to miss the first
night race at Daytona. It's such a big event. The Cat car tested
well here, so I'm looking forward to a good ride under the
lights.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Childress team?
</P>
<P>
   After making changes to his two NASCAR teams, Richard Childress
is considering adding a third Winston Cup team next year. He's put
the thought on hold until he straightens out his two other teams,
which underwent major changes two weeks ago in Michigan. ``Right
now, our goal is to get these two cars _ Dale Earnhardt and Mike
Skinner _ back to running and getting our guys healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Partner for Spencer
</P>
<P>
   Add team owner Travis Carter to the list of possible multiple
teams in 1999. He's considering a second team, joining Jimmy
Spencer. ``It's the way to go these days,'' Carter said. ``Sharing
information has been beneficial, but the future is multiple-car
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Busch series
</P>
<P>
   Craven on mend
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well, Ricky Craven will return to action this
weekend at Watkins Glen for the first time since suffering
post-concussion syndrome after the March Atlanta race. Craven
tested at the Glen last week and pronounced himself fit. He hopes
to return to the Winston Cup circuit at Daytona, if all goes well
in today's Lysol 200.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for redemption
</P>
<P>
   Having slumped to fourth in points, three-time Busch champion
Randy LaJoie sees Watkins Glen as the Redemption 200. He finished a
lap down in 21st place last year and comes to the Glen with recent
results a third at Pikes Peak and two 11ths at Dover and Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   LaJoie: ``It's time to turn up the wick.''
</P>
<P>
   Craftsman trucks
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's top 10
</P>
<P>
   Here are the top 10 things Mike Wallace and his crew have
planned before the July 4 Sears DieHard 200 in Milwaukee. 10)
Attend autograph-signing party at Solid Gold NASCAR Night; 9)
Sample the beer at Summerfest brew tents; 8) Visit five continents
in one day at the Milwaukee County Zoo; 7) Attend a Brewers game;
6) Spend a day on The Grand Avenue shopping at more than 130
specialty stores; 5) Take a ride on the Harley-Davidson Milwaukee
Iron Motorcycle Tour; 4) Try luck at the Potawatomi Bingo Casino;
take money; 3) Spend evening listening to Shania Twain at
Summerfest; 2) Take in the Firstar Fireworks display; 1) Watch
Wallace win the Sears DieHard 200.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Randy Tolsma had one of the worst records in the
Craftsman series after nine races: did not qualify four times,
didn't attempt two others and one top 10. He was 32nd in points.
Today, he's made every race, is seventh in points with five top
10s, qualifying out of the top 20 once. What's the difference?
``Simple,'' Tolsma said. ``We have better people, better trucks and
a better attitude.''

 &HT;    Reality of a lockout looming ever closer
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- When the clock strikes midnight Tuesday, NBA business
will be shut down for the summer. The owners' threat of a lockout
will become a reality, and so the league that has never had a
stoppage in play faces perhaps its biggest challenge to keep that
streak intact.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations since April have wrought very little progress. The
talks were so bad last week they abruptly broke off without another
session scheduled before the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The games next season are threatened because the sides likely
will not begin schedulingserious talks until late in the summer,
around September 1. And if talks do not progress rather rapidly
then, the owners' lockout could extend into the first week of
November, which would halt games.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the lockout prevents any player movement or
negotiation of contracts. So, players like the Hawks' Alan
Henderson, Chicago's Scottie Pippen, Phoenix's Antonio McDyess _
and more than 120 other free agents who anticipated the excitement
of free agency _ cannot negotiate a new contract.
</P>
<P>
   Also, teams cannot discuss or make trades until a new collective
bargaining agreement is reached.
</P>
<P>
   The old agreement was deemed passe by the owners, basically,
when players salaries totaled nearly 57 percent of generated
income. As per a stipulation in the pact, the owners voted 27-2 to
reopen the agreement and hammer out a new one.
</P>
<P>
   There are fundamental problems with the obsolete deal that have
to be negotiated. For one, there is no middle class in the NBA. The
top players and highly drafted rookies get substantial money, while
the quality veterans are left, at times, to play for the $1 million
exception.
</P>
<P>
   The owners believe simply that player salaries are terribly out
of whack. They are unhappy that Minnesota's Kevin Garnett, a talent
that has not won a playoff series, can command a $121 million
contract extension after just two years.
</P>
<P>
   So, to remedy that, they want to eliminate the so-called Larry
Bird Exception, where a team may go to any lengths over the salary
cap to re-sign one of it's own players. It is something the Players
Association is hell-bent on keeping.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they start talking about eliminating the Bird
Exception,'' said New York's Buck Williams, the former union
president, ``they are talking about something sacred. That's
something that cannot be touched.''
</P>
<P>
   The other area the owners want touched up is the rookie salary
scale. In the old agreement, first-round draft picks got a
guaranteed three-year deal, with the top choice guaranteed about
$10 million. But those players _ many times unproven _ hold teams
hostage after two years because of the threat of signing elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The Players Association's proposal of a five-year rookie scale
was rejected by the owners, who want a six-year deal with an option
(the team's) after the third season.
</P>
<P>
   Street and Smith's Sports Business reported that four NBA teams
lost money in 1996-97 and received as much as $3 million of
financial relief from the league. Those teams reportedly are the
Hawks, Los Angeles Clippers, Indiana Pacers and Golden State
Warriors. The league claims as many as 14 teams might need similar
help after last season.

CAESAREAN DELIVERIES REDUCES MOTHER-TO-CHILD AIDS INFECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Planned caesarean deliveries, when combined with
standard anti-AIDS drug treatment, can further reduce
mother-to-child transmission of the AIDS virus, a French researcher
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   By administering the drug AZT to pregnant women infected with
the virus, and to their newborns, doctors in the United States and
Western Europe have in recent years reduced by 50 percent the
number of babies born with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Still, each year about 500 US babies, nearly all of them
African-American and Hispanic, acquire the human immunodeficiency
virus from their mothers. The virus, which causes AIDS, is most
often transmitted during the last stages of pregnancy, especially
during labor and delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Delivering as many as possible of these infants by caesarean
section would prevent most of these cases of HIV transmission, Dr.
Laurent Mandelbrot of the Cochin-Port Royal Hospital in Paris said
at a briefing sponsored by the Journal of the American Medical
Association, which is publishing the research this week.
</P>
<P>
   The session also showcased a new test for identifying recent
cases of HIV that federal officials said would give them a better
picture of how the AIDS epidemic is evolving and also allow
researchers to gauge the effects of very early anti-HIV drug
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, doctors and public health officials had no quick,
inexpensive way to identify which people acquired HIV within the
previous month or year, versus those who harbored the virus for
longer periods.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert S. Janssen, of the US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, said the new test will allow public health officials to
get up-to-date information on who is getting infected and by what
means. Identifying recent infections might also make it easier to
trace sexual contacts and possibly break the chain of transmission
_ although Janssen acknowledged this will be controversial because
of confidentiality issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recently infected people may be the most infectious to
others,'' Janssen said. ``We now have what we didn't have before: a
way to identify the spark before it starts a fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The AMA session preceded today's opening of the 12th World AIDS
Conference here.
</P>
<P>
   The conference, last held two years ago in Vancouver, has
attracted more than 12,000 people to hear 5,400 reports on every
aspect of the epidemic, first recognized 17 summers ago. An
estimated 30 million people worldwide are infected with HIV.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp reduction in newborn HIV infections in industrialized
countries has been the brightest development so far in AIDS
prevention, and there will be much discussion this week of how to
extend the benefits of AZT treatment to infants in poorer
societies.
</P>
<P>
   The French report that caesarean delivery can reduce
mother-child HIV transmission is ``clearly good news for women with
HIV,'' Mandelbrot said. But he acknowledged that it would not
benefit millions of women in countries that cannot afford surgical
deliveries _ nor would such operations be safe for women in much of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in urban hospitals in most parts of Africa, maternal
mortality and complications associated with caesarean section is
extremely high,'' Mandelbrot said. ``But there are a lot of places
where this can be done safely.''
</P>
<P>
   French researchers studied 2,834 pregnancies, in which 902 of
the women received AZT treatment before and during delivery and
their babies got the drug for six weeks. Among cases not receiving
the anti-AIDS drugs, 17 percent of the infants became infected.
</P>
<P>
   Women and babies who got AZT reduced the infection rate to 6.4
percent, echoing earlier studies. But when researchers considered
the type of delivery, they found that nearly 7 percent of vaginally
delivered babies became infected compared with 11 percent of those
delivered by emergency caesarean section and only 0.8 percent _ one
infant out of 133 _ delivered by planned caesarean.
</P>
<P>
   The benefit of caesarean delivery, Mandelbrot said, apparently
depends on doing the surgery before the mother goes into labor and
before membranes surrounding the fetus and amniotic fluid have
spontaneously ruptured.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't promise to reduce transmission to below 1 percent,''
Mandelbrot said. ``By 38 weeks, 20 percent of women will have
delivered spontaneously.'' Scheduling a caesarean earlier would run
the risk of delivering the infant prematurely.

KLAN RALLIES IN TOWN WHERE BLACK MAN WAS SAVAGELY SLAIN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ The anguished peace of a small town reeling from
a brutal slaying was fractured Saturday by a spectacle of hate.
</P>
<P>
   As two dozen hooded Ku Klux Klansmen spewed racist rhetoric in
Jasper's historic courthouse square, police struggled to repel
nearly 30 black militants, including members of the New Black
Panthers and black Muslims, who repeatedly rushed at the white
supremacists, challenging them to fight.
</P>
<P>
   Wielding shotguns and strapped with ammunition, nearly two dozen
additional members of the Houston-based New Black Panthers were
barred from the square by the FBI, Texas Rangers, and local police.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous skirmishes erupted between sympathizers for the
factions, but only two arrests were made, for disorderly conduct,
and no one was seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hate versus hate, right in the town square,'' said Willie
Rhodes, a local logger. ``It's like a high-noon, country
shootout.''
</P>
<P>
   The backdrop to the showdown was the gruesome slaying of James
Byrd Jr., a disabled musician, on June 7 in what police have called
one of the most brutal hate crimes in the South in many years.
Three white supremacists were charged with beating Byrd, chaining
him to the back of a truck, and dragging him nearly 3 miles on a
country road, tearing his body to pieces.
</P>
<P>
   The atrocity ignited national outrage and prompted many black
residents of Jasper to protest what they say is their second-class
status in a community controlled by whites.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Byrd's family had urged Jasper residents to boycott the
rally. Saturday
</P>
<P>
   ``Let this horrendous violation of the sanctity of life not be a
spark that ignites more hatred and retribution,'' Byrd's family
said. ``Rather, let this be a wake-up call for America _ for all
Americans. May it spark a new cleansing fire of self-examination
and reflection.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the vast majority of Jasper's 8,000 residents heeded
the appeal, several hundred spectators turned out, including scores
who heckled the white supremacists as they declared Jasper ``Klan
country.''
</P>
<P>
   KKK leaders, who disavowed any association with Byrd's alleged
killers, said they requested a permit to rally in Jasper because
the ``liberal media'' unfairly linked them to Byrd's murder and
because they wanted to restore the ``white pride'' that may have
been damaged in the fallout from the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   Some Jasper residents hailed members of the New Black Panthers
and black Muslims as they tried to break through police barriers
and confront the Klan groups from Texas and Louisiana. Several Klan
sympathizers said they had weapons ready in case of a
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to say to the Klan that you will no longer
intimidate and harass people, and if you get out of line today,
wishing to drag a black man behind a truck, we have brought our God
and our guns, and we will blast you to hell and back,'' said
Minister Quanell X, of the black Muslim movement in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Klan members declined the challenge. Many of them
recoiled as the black groups charged their cars as they drove away
from the courthouse after the rally.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper officials, who said they had prayed for rain to wash out
the event, watched in vain in the steamy, 95-degree heat as the
street drama unfolded. For nearly two hours, a force of 200 law
enforcement offices struggled to maintain peace in the small,
usually quiet town center.
</P>
<P>
   A similar number of journalists, some of them from as far as
Japan and Sweden, scurried to record the scene, as the New Black
Panthers and black Muslims circled the courthouse, searching for a
gap in the police line around the Klan members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like this in my life,'' said Jasper
County Judge Joe Folk, ``and I hope I never do again.''
</P>
<P>
   On a weekend when the community traditionally prepares for its
annual Jasper Jamboree Fourth of July festival, a Klan sympathizer
waving a Confederate flag and carrying a knife was arrested outside
the local thrift shop. An ally of the Black Panthers was arrested
as he tried to lunge at a Lincoln Continental carrying away Klan
leaders after the rally. And supporters of the factions toted
placards with such messages as ``White Power'' and ``The Only Good
Fascist Is A Dead One.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not happy for any groups to come in and try to divide
our county,'' said Jasper Police Chief Homer Alexander. ``But we
made sure nobody's civil rights were violated, everybody got to say
what they wanted to say, and nobody got hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Jasper residents said they were drawn to the showdown by
curiosity and a reluctance to miss one of the largest news events
in city history. Others said they turned out to denounce hatred,
and some said they attended as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
   A few said they wanted to know if the KKK hoods covered faces
they knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to know who these people are,'' Eddie Williams said.
``I got a family and I'm going to protect them any way I can. I
need to know if one of these guys is my friend, my banker,
whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Byrd's slaying, many blacks have raised new questions
about the deaths of several Jasper residents in recent years,
including the 1989 hanging of Rodney Williams, whose family
believes he was killed for dating a white woman.
</P>
<P>
   Police ruled the case a suicide. But Abert Williams Jr.,
Rodney's father, said he believes authorities covered up evidence
to protect his son's killers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was no suicide,'' Williams said. ``He loved himself and
God too much'' to kill himself.
</P>
<P>
   Other black leaders complained about the town's lingering
segregation, from the churches to neighborhoods to the public
cemetery, where Byrd was buried in a back section traditionally
reserved for blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough is enough,'' said Reverend Ray Charles Lewis, a local
church pastor. ``From now on, we should take any steps necessary to
make clear that the KKK or anyone else are not safe violating our
rights. We will not live in fear.''
</P>
<P>
   On the road where Byrd died, more than 80 fading orange rings
mark the spots were police found parts of his body and his effects.
There is also a memorial to Byrd, a white cross inscribed with his
name and a biblical passage that condemns evil and promises that
``the meek shall inherit the Earth.''

LIVE TV BROADCAST OF CLINTON-ZEMIN EXCHANGE IS A FIRST FOR CHINA

<P>
   BEIJING _ Chinese expecting to see the news on government-run
television at noon Saturday tuned in to history instead.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that stunned but gratified President Clinton and his
delegation, the Chinese government let the freewheeling news
conference between the U.S. leader and President Jiang Zemin pour
live over the airwaves to a potential audience of 1.2 billion
people.
</P>
<P>
   There were none of the cuts and suspect translations that marked
earlier government-sanctioned broadcasts by U.S. presidents during
visits to China. The whole 70-minute exchange _ including Clinton's
comments about the Tiananmen massacre nine years ago and the two
leaders' pointed debate on their nations' differing views of human
rights _ was on the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never been a live event quite like it,'' said a U.S.
diplomat with long experience in China.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger,
said the show was probably the first live broadcast in China of
press conference by a visiting foreign leader ``and certainly was
the most extensive public discussion by far between a Chinese
leader and an American leader on human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese government spokesman Zhu Bangzao refused to say when and
by whom the decision was made to air the leaders' joint appearance.
But he relished the attention generated by the decision to permit
the telecast.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has shown that China has adopted an open attitude and
would like people to know the different attitudes of different
sides,'' Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
   White House planners had urged Chinese officials to give the
American president's public comments as much air time as possible,
but as recently as Friday senior Clinton aides were uncertain how
much coverage to expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hoping they'd do it, and they just threw the switch,''
said a White House official who participated in planning Clinton's
nine-day visit to China.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Mike McCurry said he got an indication
from the Chinese side shortly before the news conference that it
would be broadcast live. But he was uncertain why.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're maybe reaching a point where they desire a more open
debate on human rights and want to present their position more
clearer to their own people,'' McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry and Zhu said the live broadcast was not negotiated
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this was a question of concession or
compromise,'' Zhu said. ``It was a decision solely made by the
Chinese side.''
</P>
<P>
   Experienced Chinese observers, however, saw in the broadcast a
decision by Jiang to accommodate Clinton and repay his dedication
to the trip and the welcoming ceremony in Tiananmen Square in the
face of vocal criticism back home.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing the broadcast ``must have been Jiang's decision at the
last minute,'' said Jasper Becker, Beijing correspondent of Hong
Kong's respected South China Morning Post. ``Clinton put his neck
on the line coming to Tiananmen and he was owed something.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jiang had to know that Clinton would probably say something
about Tiananmen, and it would have been very embarrassing if
Clinton had said those things and then all the reports had been
about how they not were not broadcast in China,'' Becker said.
</P>
<P>
   Live broadcasts of any kind are rare in China, a U.S. diplomat
said, recalling only two recently: the 1997 ceremony in Hong Kong
marking the reversion of the British colony to Chinese control and
the session in which Zhu Rongji was elevated to the premiership
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   For earlier U.S. presidential visits, Chinese government
broadcasters have promised full coverage, but not delivered.
</P>
<P>
   During President Reagan's 1984 trip, after promising to
rebroadcast a key speech by the American leader during prime
viewing time, the Chinese edited the tape to delete references to
the Soviet Union and what White House spokesman Larry Speakes
called at the time ``values that Americans cherish.''
</P>
<P>
   When President Bush was in Beijing in 1989, a brief question and
answer session with Chinese television reporters was shown, but
accompanied by what U.S. diplomats called a ``doctored''
translation that toned down some of the president's comments on
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. television networks used the Bush trip in February 1989 and
the historic visit of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in May that
year as an excuse to bring their own satellite dishes into China _
and leave them in the country. That meant that the equipment was
still there less than four months later and could be used to beam
pictures of the Tiananmen demonstration around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The satellites were ordered shut down, with at least one U.S.
network broadcasting live as Chinese officials demanded that the
plug be pulled _ and the screen then going blank.
</P>
<P>
   Networks were not allowed to bring in new dishes for Clinton's
trip. All television transmissions for foreign broadcasters,
including those used by U.S. networks to send home reports on the
Clinton trip, are being handled through Chinese government
facilities.

<P>
   BEIJING _ President Clinton delivered a pointed lecture on human
rights to Chinese leader Jiang Zemin Saturday _ an extraordinary
reprimand because it was televised live across China to a citizenry
unaccustomed to such a bald critique of its government.
</P>
<P>
   Standing before the gathered media in the vast Great Hall of the
People, Clinton and Jiang traded accusations and explanations over
human rights and other issues for more than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening moments, Clinton, fresh from a welcoming ceremony
in Tiananmen Square, condemned the Chinese government's actions in
the killing of hundreds of democracy protesters on the historic
plaza on June 4, 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe, and the American people believe, that the use of
force and the tragic loss of life was wrong,'' Clinton said. ``I
believe, and the American people believe, that freedom of speech,
association, and religion are the right of people everywhere and
should be protected by their governments.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Jiang thrice referred to the massacre as a ``political
disturbance,'' once saying, ``Had the Chinese government not taken
the resolute measures, then we could not have enjoyed the stability
that we are enjoying today.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the roundup of several dissidents last week at the
outset of the summit, Jiang replied, ``Any law-breaking activities
must be dealt with according to law.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials appeared excited with the session and
placed far more emphasis on its live broadcast than the relatively
modest policy accomplishments that came out of private meetings
between the leaders earlier in the day. White House spokesman
Michael D. McCurry described the news conference as ``remarkable,''
and Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, called
it ``truly historic.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the barbs were softened by a flurry of compliments between
the two, in contrast to a similarly free-wheeling news conference
when Jiang arrived in Washington for a summit last October and the
pair tangled over human rights with nary a good word between them.
This time, the leaders seemed to develop a rapport that saw them
constantly laughing and joking with each other in private.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the exchanges, Jiang, animated and often smiling,
seemed to invite the debate, even prompting an exchange on Chinese
rule of Tibet, though no question had been asked about it.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Saturday, Clinton said, ``Our friendship may never
be perfect. No friendship is. But I hope it will last forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Publicly and privately, Clinton advisers expressed a belief that
the president's performance Saturday helped salvage a summit that
had increasingly seemed destined to fail. They also used the news
conference as vindication for the administration's policy of
engagement, in which Clinton and senior aides involve Chinese
leaders in high-level talks in hopes of affecting change in such
areas as human rights and trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``He reached Chinese people,'' said Winston Lord, a former
ambassador to Beijing and Clinton administration State Department
official. ``He shored up his domestic support for his trip and
policy, and he gained the respect of the Chinese leaders by being
firm. You don't deal with the Chinese by being restrained.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton extolled the virtues of his policy, saying at the news
conference, ``You should at least appreciate the fact that we now
have an atmosphere in which it is possible for us to be open and
honest and in great detail about this.''
</P>
<P>
   The day began with an arrival ceremony replete with a military
review on Tiananmen Square. The People's Liberation Army rifled a
21-gun salute.
</P>
<P>
   The event had raised the ire of human rights activists and
congressional Republicans, who said Clinton's appearance on
Tiananmen Square would demean the memories of the slain protesters
and help Chinese government officials put the massacre behind them.
The White House was so sensitive to the issue that officials had
wrongly told reporters in prior days that the ceremony was near the
square, not on it.
</P>
<P>
   The night ended with a festive state dinner at the Maoist-era
Great Hall of the People, where the military band played ``Chelsea
Morning'' and ``Home on the Range.'' The latter was played for
President Nixon when he came to Peking in 1972. Clinton even
conducted the band as it played ``Hands Across the Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Your people are leading lives inconceivable just a generation
ago,'' Clinton told Jiang in a toast.
</P>
<P>
   In Jiang's toast, he said, ``China and the US differ in social
system, ideology, cultural tradition, and historical background and
are at different stages of economic development. It is nothing
strange that they should have some differences of views on certain
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Jiang, and their aides, met in the Great Hall for
over two hours and hashed out a series of modest agreements.
</P>
<P>
   First was a so-called detargeting agreement, in which China and
the United States will no longer aim nuclear missiles at each
other. Because the weapons can be retargeted in a matter of
minutes, the move was considered largely symbolic, but would at
least serve to lessen the chances of an accidental launch.
</P>
<P>
   In a breakthrough, China agreed to allow the United States to
inspect US high technology imports to be assured that they were
being used for the approved purpose.
</P>
<P>
   China vowed to ``actively study'' the formal adoption of the
Missile Technology Control Regime, and agreed, along with the
United States not to export medium- and long-range missiles to
Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
   On the economic front, the United States again declined to offer
China full support for admission to the World Trade Organization.
US officials expressed disappointment that China had not taken
greater steps to lower tariffs on American goods to help chip away
at the $50 billion annual trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The area where progress was made was in new tariff cuts across
a wide range of products, though not enough, particularly in some
of the key export areas that are important to American workers and
producers,'' said Gene Sperling, Clinton's national economics
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   On the sensitive issue of Taiwan, Clinton told Jiang he
continues to support a ``one China'' policy and would not advocate
Taiwan for any international organizations that require independent
statehood. But Clinton also said it was crucial to the United
States that China resolve Taiwan's status peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Clinton urged Jiang to preserve the cultural and
religious identity of Tibet, which is under Chinese rule, and to
meet with Tibet's religious leader, the Dalai Lama, who fled Tibet
in 1959 after a failed uprising against China rule. The Dalai Lama
has said he has abandoned his goal of an independent Tibet, and is
now pushing for autonomous rule by Tibet as a part of China.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the Dalai Lama can publicly make the statement and
a commitment that Tibet is an inalienable part of China and he must
also recognize Taiwan as a province of China, then the door to
dialogue and negoiation is open,'' said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in the final words of the news conference, replied: ``I
have spent time with the Dalai Lama. I believe him to be an honest
man, and I believe if he had a conversation with President Jiang,
they would like each other very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was to attend church in Beijing on Sunday and speak on
religious liberty, before embarking with his family on a day of
sightseeing.

IN WAKE OF TEXAS KILLING, BLACK MILITANTS AND KLAN TRADE WORDS, NOT
BLOWS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ Despite fears of violence, a showdown between
white supremacists and black militants remained relatively peaceful
here on Saturday on Jasper's lovely courthouse square, leaving
residents feeling relieved, but used.
</P>
<P>
   Racial name-calling and threats were as bad as it got on a
sweltering day in this East Texas town, where a black man, James
Byrd Jr., was dragged to death behind a pickup truck three weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wrong for either of them to be here,'' Joyce Edmond, a
black woman, said of the two groups. Like many here, and other
residents who stayed away from the square, she said the two groups
were just using the tragedy to get attention for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Ringed by state troopers wearing face shields and bullet-proof
vests, about 25 robed and hooded Ku Klux Klan members from Waco and
Vidor gave speeches peppered with racial slurs. The Klansmen had
said beforehand that they were coming to Jasper to disavow any
connection with the three men charged in the grisly killing of
Byrd, 49.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two hours, about 200 law enforcement officers kept
the Klansmen separated from about 50 members of the Black Muslims
of Houston and New Black Panthers of Dallas. The militants had
arrived in town with trunkloads of guns, which some members carried
through the streets. Although it is legal in Texas to carry a
loaded weapon in public, police did not allow any guns on
courthouse grounds.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen militants twice tried to break through the police
barricades.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Khalid Muhammad, a former spokesman for the Nation
of Islam, tried to get onlookers in the crowd _ members of the
media easily outnumbered the 200 spectators _ to join in their
attempts to overcome police and get at the Klan members.
</P>
<P>
   No one was hurt, but two men, one white and one black, were
arrested for disorderly conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Onlookers at times broke out laughing at what seemed to them to
be comedy. They laughed when the Klan's taped country music kept
going off, and laughed when one of the Black Muslims chased a
carload of departing Klansmen on foot.
</P>
<P>
   The Klansmen said they were there to protect whites from the New
Black Panthers and Black Muslims. The militants said they were
there to protect blacks from the Klan.
</P>
<P>
   But the message was typical of traditional Klan rallies, as the
speakers warned of black conspiracies, dwindling white political
influence, and cover-ups by the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jasper is part of the Invisible Empire,'' said Rick Anderson,
a leader of the Knights of the White Kamellia, a klavern based in
Vidor.
</P>
<P>
   A small group of whites in the crowd, most of them from outside
of Jasper, applauded and cheered the Klan's speeches, but was
drowned out by the jeers of others, white and black.
</P>
<P>
   The Black Muslims and Panthers urged black people in the crowd
to retaliate with violence for the murder of Byrd, who was killed
on an isolated road outside of Jasper. Several black people in the
crowd cheered them, including some young people who said the claims
by older blacks that Jasper has no real, prevalent racial
oppression were false.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be Jasper people under those hoods,'' said Kenny
Brumley, 28, of Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   As the Klan members, Black Muslims and New Black Panthers
prepared to meet on the grounds of the old courthouse, Byrd's
family, as it has all through this ordeal, issued an appeal for
peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let this horrendous violation of the sanctity of life not be a
spark that ignites more hatred and retribution,'' wrote the family
in a statement handed out late Friday. ``Rather, let this be a
wake-up call for America, for all Americans. Let it spark a
cleansing fire of self-examination and reflection.''
</P>
<P>
   Klan members had said that this rally was intended to distance
the organization from Byrd's murder. Texas prison officials have
said that two of the men charged in Byrd's slaying, John William
King, 23, of Jasper, and Lawrence Russell Brewer, 31, of Sulphur
Springs, had ties to white supremacy groups.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Allen Berry, 23, of Jasper, is also facing charges in the
killing.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer and King had been linked in the past to the Confederate
Knights of America, a loosely defined prison gang that is aligned
with the Klan. Both men, prison officials said, have tattoos that
mark them as white supremacists, and King was disciplined in prison
in 1995 for a racial disturbance between whites and Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Jasper's 8,000 residents dreaded the confrontation, and
have repeatedly begged outsiders to let them try to cope with the
tragedy on their own. Jasper, which is about 45 percent black, has
drawn praise around the country for keeping its calm in the days
after the killing.
</P>
<P>
   As the groups talked and gesticulated, the three men accused of
Byrd's killing sat in a Jasper County cellblock, waiting to see if
the murder charges against them, which carry a life sentence, will
be upgraded to capital murder, which could bring a death sentence.
Prosecutors are expected to charge King and Brewer with capital
murder.
</P>
<P>
   Berry, who owned the pickup, has been the only one to cooperate
with investigators. Much of what state and federal investigators
learned about the night of Byrd's killing was from a lengthy
statement from Berry.
</P>
<P>
   Berry, who, after a bungled burglary, was incarcerated with King
in a prison boot camp, told investigators that the men were driving
through Jasper at about 2 a.m. on June 7 when they saw Byrd walking
at the side of the road.
</P>
<P>
   Berry gave Byrd a ride in back of the truck, which angered King.
Berry said that King took the wheel from him, and drove to a dark
road outside of town, where King and Brewer beat and kicked Byrd,
according to Berry's account.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, who was severely beaten first, was chained by his ankles
to the bumper of the truck and dragged until his body came apart.
Investigators marked more than two miles of the road with red
circles of paint, showing where they found Byrd's head, his
dentures, one arm, and several smears of blood.
</P>
<P>
   As much as they dreaded the confrontations of groups such as
those at the courthouse on Saturday, many people here said they
expected them because of the hideous nature of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never had anything like this here, until now,'' said Ms.
Edmond. She said both sides in the confrontation should look to the
Bible.
</P>
<P>
   She was just one of many who said they wanted all the television
cameras and those who would take advantage of them to go home. At
one point on Saturday, all the camera operators could not even fit
in the walkways as they chased one Black Muslim leader around the
courthouse. One of them stepped into a flower bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please stay out of the flowers,'' one woman yelled from the
crowd, shaking her head.

COMMENTARY: YANKEES KEEP BRUISING THE METS' EGO  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thanks to a train wreck of a subway series, those who
have only recently arrived in town at least now know which team
represents the straphangers of New York City baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for instance, Mike Piazza, the subject of recent
speculation that he might consider a return next year to Los
Angeles, the coastal expanse where freeways reign. If Piazza didn't
understand the local pedestrian status of the Mets, consecutive
spankings by the Yankees at Shea Stadium have been as instructional
as they've been humbling.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the most balanced club I've seen in a while,'' Piazza
said admiringly of George Steinbrenner's team, without explaining
if a while was inclusive of his years in Little League. ``There's
no weakness I can see.''
</P>
<P>
   On a strictly competitive level, every Met worth his millions
should recognize following Saturday's 7-2 defeat that anything less
than near-perfect baseball isn't good enough against the juggernaut
from the Bronx. In the image-related contest of which team has
better mastered the big-city strut, the series thus far has been
the equivalent of a steel cage wrestling match between Hulk Hogan
and Mr. Met.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take Catcher Cam or Piazza's good seat behind the
plate to plainly see how the Yankees have been willing to let the
Mets take their best shots, before leveling them with a single,
incisive blow. In Game 1, the Mets' Lost Weekend on a Friday Night,
the Yankees eradicated a third deficit of the night in an opposing
ball park when Paul O'Neill put the Mets away with a three-run
homer off Mel Rojas. Saturday, after the Mets had emptied their pop
guns on Andy Pettitte in the first three innings, they were floored
by Tino Martinez's three-run blast off Bobby Jones in the fourth,
which unleashed a torrent of pro-Yankee noise so loud it drowned
out the airport next door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not kid ourselves, a lot of Yankee fans came over
here,'' Piazza said. ``I don't want to say that they're the most
popular team. Maybe the more publicized team. But I don't think we
have any inferiority complex at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he doesn't, but he is a virtual outsider, still
familiarizing himself with the city's contemporary sports culture,
which ranks the Yankees at the top and the Mets firmly ahead of the
Liberty. The resident Mets and especially their manager know better
the frustrations of competing for attention with a team whose
eighth-place hitter, Scott Brosius, checked in Saturday with more
runs batted in than anyone in Bobby Valentine's lineup, including
Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, this series has been no well-timed distraction for
the Mets from their ego-building exercise known as the wild-card
race and their efforts to be taken seriously by the public, the
politicians and Piazza. And not necessarily in that order.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a personal standpoint, it may have been beneficial for me
to move on,'' Piazza said on the eve of this series, referring to
his departure from the Dodgers. ``They're going to have a lot of
growing pains to get back to where they want to be. I'm very happy
to be in a stable situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Mets, these words were spoken before what
had been the All-Star season of their best pitcher, Al Leiter, was
imperiled by injury Friday night, before the sight of the best team
in baseball knocked the Mets off their knack of playing tight
defense and before the typical insecurities _ like when the rich
neighbor rolls the BMW into his driveway and you can't get the old
battered wagon to turn over _ surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit A was Valentine's response to mild news media and fan
suggestions that he had erred in bringing in the slumping Rojas, a
right-hander, to pitch to the left-handed O'Neill in Friday night's
decisive moment. In a 6-1 game Saturday in the seventh, Valentine
did call for a southpaw, Bill Pulsipher, to face O'Neill, who
promptly lined a run-scoring single. Valentine, on the top step of
his dugout, gestured up at the press box, as if to say, ``OK?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Live and learn,'' the manager said with a smirk afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Was he sticking it to reporters?
</P>
<P>
   ``So what if I was sticking it to them?'' he said. ``What's
wrong with that?''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, except that he is having enough problems trying to
stick with the Yankees, players don't appreciate being made
examples of and, like it or not, Piazza is making his own
evaluations as to where this team is going and if he'll want to be
part of it.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of opportunity, Piazza heaped more praise on the
Yankees when he said: ``You have to take advantage of every
opportunity. If you don't, you're in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, conversely, let a slow-starting Pettitte off the hook
early. Then John Olerud dropped an easy throw from Rey Ordonez
behind second base on O'Neill's bouncer in the fourth inning, and
after Darryl Strawberry singled, Martinez hit his 11th home run of
the season. The Yankees' steaming engine was on its way. The Mets
have another chance Sunday night to show New York and Piazza there
is light at the end of their tunnel.

SORENSTAM SHOOTS RECORD 65 AND LEADS INKSTER BY 2 STROKES  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABSECON, N.J. _ Annika Sorenstam plays golf with such precision
and consistency that no one questioned her dominance here Saturday
when she made a bogey after 30 holes in the ShopRite LPGA Classic.
The premier player in women's golf responded with three birdies on
the last four holes and will have a two-shot lead over Julie
Inkster going into Sunday's final day of the $1-million tournament.
</P>
<P>
   After firing a 66 on opening day, Sorenstam shot a six-under-par
65 Saturday afternoon to match the best round by an LPGA player on
the 6,024-yard Bay Course at the Seaview Marriott Resort, where the
tournament returned after 11 years at Somers Point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very comfortable about my game,'' Sorenstam said after
her round of seven birdies and a bogey. ``The last month or so, my
game has come together, and I hope I stay calm and play a shot at a
time for another day. I like to be in contention and play in the
last group on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam will play in the last group with Inkster, a two-time
winner of this event, who shot a 66 Saturday and is alone at 133.
</P>
<P>
   Inkster started the day a shot behind Sorenstam and four others,
and she was the only player to threaten Sorenstam seriously at the
end.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Barrett, who also shared the first-day lead, shot a 69 and
was alone in third at 135, a shot ahead of Rosie Jones (68), Donna
Andrews (68), Lorie Kane (67), Kelly Robbins (67), and Dawn
Coe-Jones, who shot a 65 to match Saturday's effort by Sorenstam
and Sherri Turner in 1987 as the best round on this course by an
LPGA player.
</P>
<P>
   Inkster, Jones, Coe-Jones, Andrews, and Robbins never got to the
top of the leaderboard on an ideal day for golf after severe
thunderstoms suspended play twice on Friday. Rather, it was an
unknown who took the spotlight away from Sorenstam, but only for a
few holes.
</P>
<P>
   Smriti Mehra of India, who started the day a shot behind the
leaders, vaulted ahead with three birdies on the first four holes,
but she fell behind with bogeys on the sixth and ninth. Mehra is at
137 after shooting a 70 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam regained the lead from Mehra with birdies of her own
at the third and fifth holds, but found herself tied at the turn
tied at seven under par with Barrett and Inkster, the winner of
this tournament in 1986 and 1988. Inkster had three birdies on the
front nine.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam took the lead again with a birdie 2 on the 11th hole
but bogeyed the 371-yard 12th when she three-putted, falling into a
tie with Barrett. But Sorenstam regained the lead with a birdie on
the par-3 15th and extended it with another birdie on the last
hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``The course fit my game pretty well the last two days,''
Sorenstam said. ``It's a course that makes you think and I like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Alicia Dibos of Peru (72), Caroline McMillan of England (72),
and Moira Dunn (71), who started the day tied for the lead with
Sorenstam and Barrett, faded early.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Lopez was among those who missed the cut, which was at
one-over 143. Lopez shot a 71 Saturday with birdies on her last two
holes for a two-day total of 145.
</P>
<P>
   It marked the third time this season that she failed to make the
cut.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle McGann, who with rounds of 65 and 64 edged Sorenstam to
win the tournament last year, also missed the cut. She shot a 75
Saturday to go with a 73 on Friday when her round included a
quadruple-bogey 8 on the 12th hole.

NBA lockout appears certain
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
The labor landscape in the NBA is a lot like a typical Houston lawn
these days. If you don't water it, growth will be slow and, in some
cases, imperceptible.
</P>
<P>
   So it is in the Great NBA Labor Fight of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Because neither the owners nor the players have been willing to
water down their headstrong emotions the past few times they have
met at the bargaining table, the NBA expects to impose its second
work stoppage in four summers by locking out the players Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   That is the beginning of the fiscal year in the NBA and the
league wants to freeze player movement until the sides can hammer
out a collective-bargaining agreement. What amounts to the owners
asking for give-backs because of botched bargaining negotiations in
the past will lead them to suspend all operations with players.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the league's standpoint, representing the owners, it's
really very simple under the current system _ too much money is
being paid out in salaries,'' said NBA deputy commissioner Russ
Granik, the league's point man in the negotiations. ``And we need a
new system that will bring salary growth in line with revenue
growth. And we anticipate very strong revenue growth over the next
four years. That's the big issue from a management standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the problem, from what we've been told from the
players' standpoint, is that they don't want any controls on
salaries for high-end players. And it's kind of difficult to get
those two positions to mesh. And it may be impossible. So we have
to find some other ground if we're going to make a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations have been going on for more than two months.
Movement has been microscopic on both sides. Progress has been
nonexistent. A lockout is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Some issues are not so staggering. The players have agreed the
three-year rookie wage scale needs to be longer, as the owners
want. A new five-year rookie contract is likely to be in place in
the new agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But other problems figure to be bitter, hard-fought battles. In
particular, the owners want to do away with or limit severely the
so-called Larry Bird exception that allows teams to sign their own
free agents to any amount, regardless of how far over the league's
soft cap the contract might put a team.
</P>
<P>
   The players, meanwhile, are standing firm, saying they never
will give up the right to total free agency nor the idea of
re-signing with their own team at any amount. In addition, the
issue of random marijuana testing figures to be a sticking point.
</P>
<P>
   The players point to the fact owners never have volunteered to
open their books and let the bottom lines for all 29 teams be made
a public record. The NBA has become a global industry with billions
of dollars in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   And it is the players, along with a souped-up marketing machine,
that generate the incredible revenues, not only from ticket sales,
but merchandising sales and other money-making streams.
</P>
<P>
   The players believe the owners are balking at an agreement that
was reached in 1995 and originally was scheduled for six years. The
owners retained the option of reopening the collective-bargaining
agreement if, after three years, the money paid to players rose
above 52 percent of the defined gross revenues. This money also is
called basketball-related income.
</P>
<P>
   For the 1997-98 season, the players received more than $950
million in salaries. This represented approximately 57 percent of
all basketball-related income.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, the owners voted 27-2 on March 23 to reopen
negotiations, effectively nullifying the final three years of the
'95 agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The owners agreed that 52 percent was a point at which the
agreement would not be working,'' commissioner David Stern said.
``The owners could easily have not reopened the agreement. But at
that point, losses would have become certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a serious economic issue. The fact is that we will have
paid out almost a billion dollars in compensation (this season)
and, under any scenario I can imagine, we will continue to pay out
more than that each year so that overall compensation will continue
to rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not running away from the payment. But we need to slow
the growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The players see it differently. Patrick Ewing, president of the
players' union, and NBA Players Association executive director
Billy Hunter believe the owners want a built-in mechanism to
protect them from themselves.
</P>
<P>
   That is not the players' responsibility, the union heads say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't consider it to be the players being asked to protect
the owners from themselves,'' Stern said. ``I think of it more as,
we have a lot of money to pay out. Why don't we find a way to make
sure that this system is intelligent, that it maintains competitive
balance and that it reduces pressure on teams to continually raise
ticket prices in a double-digit way, because that's a spiral that
doesn't seem to be yielding an intelligent business result.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern said as many as nine teams this year will receive some
sort of subsidy _ a profit-sharing boost, if you will _ from the
NBA to make up for shortfalls on the bottom line. Only four teams
received such subsidies last year.
</P>
<P>
   The way the current agreement has been going, Stern claims half
the teams in the NBA would be losing money by the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   So the owners are ready to do whatever is necessary to batten
down the financial hatches. They saw what a work stoppage did to
baseball, which lost the World Series in '94 because of a players
strike and never has fully recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the owners claim they have solidarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The owners voted 27-2 to open up the collective-bargaining
agreement, and they did so knowing what the risks are,'' Stern
said. ``They did not receive a sugar-coated presentation about what
the risks are that are associated with reopening a
collective-bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it fair to say that this situation reflects mistakes at the
bargaining table in the past? Yes. We've managed to keep the wolf
from the door over the years by virtue of a system that has more or
less worked and by the infusion of new dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's not working now.''
</P>
<P>
   The lockout comes at a time when the NBA faces crossroads in
other areas as well, Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had by NBA standards a very successful year,'' he
said. ``That said, we know we're in the midst of collective
bargaining and we know that eventually, if not sooner, Michael
Jordan will be retiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we also know that we've had sort of an interesting year
with respect to Latrell Sprewell. But that's life in the NBA. On
balance, we're very happy about where the NBA is and we think its
growth is going to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   But how that growth is distributed appears to be leading to the
sort of infighting that could have a long-term impact if a
settlement isn't reached during the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA never has lost any games to a work stoppage. But the
clock is about to start ticking. And if they don't come up with a
workable agreement for both sides in the next three months, those
October training camps could be in danger.

 &HT;    Four children with E. coli remain in area hospitals
 &HT;    By David Pendered
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Four children with confirmed E. coli infections
remained hospitalized Saturday in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials, acting on requests from the parents, have
not identified the children.
</P>
<P>
   At Egleston Children's Hospital, a 3-year-old boy, admitted June
20, remained in good condition. At Scottish Rite Children's Medical
Center, a 3-year-old boy, admitted June 20, remained in serious
condition. A 2-year-old girl, admitted June 15, was in critical
condition. And a 4-year-old girl, admitted June 18, was also in
critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   Two little sisters and a 5-year-old boy from Georgia who
survived a bout of the E. coli bacteria were discharged Friday from
these hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Two sisters, age 6 and 2, were sent home from Egleston, where
they had been hospitalized since June 6.
</P>
<P>
   Scottish Rite Children's Medical Center sent home a 5-year-old
boy who was hospitalized June 23.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a fourth child, admitted June 23 and suspected of
having the disease, was discharged Friday from Scottish Rite. The
youngster's age and gender were not made public. Lab tests were not
complete on whether the child had E. coli.

CHINA SUMMIT CALLED A SUCCESS, DESPITE A FEW THORNY ISSUES 
 
 
 
BY CRAGG HINES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The Clinton administration, painting the summit with
China as a success, praised progress on nuclear nonproliferation
issues Saturday but conceded key decisions still lay ahead for the
Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger, U.S. national security adviser, said
the nuclear control agreements approved by Presidents Clinton and
Jiang Zemin came ``as China increasingly becomes part of the global
nonproliferation regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger acknowledged, however, the incremental nature of some of
the steps announced after Clinton and Jiang met for about two hours
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Most elusive was concrete action on defusing the nuclear
confrontation in southern Asia, where regional rivals India and
Pakistan each recently tested nuclear devices. The gist of a
three-page joint statement on the troubling development was that
Washington and Beijing would continue to consult closely.
</P>
<P>
   Given China's edgy relations with India and historic military
support for Pakistan, little more of substance was expected on the
thorny issue.
</P>
<P>
   The American side was heartened by the Chinese decision to agree
to actively study joining the Missile Technology Control Regime, an
international pact that limits export of nuclear know-how and
equipment for warhead delivery systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, what does that mean?'' Berger asked, anticipating
questions about the nebulous nature of the Chinese promise. He
called it ``an important step'' toward Beijing fully subscribing to
the control agreement. Actual agreement to the MTCR, he said, would
be ``a very significant development in terms of the sales of
missile technology worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger said the interim step followed a pattern of China's
inching up to finally signing international accords.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese often jump across the river in two or three
steps,'' Berger said. In the case of the MTCR, the Chinese began
several years ago by saying they would observe the regime's
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said that ``general commitment'' did not necessarily mean
China was observing MTCR's detailed list of prohibited sales, ``and
it's not binding in any kind of international way.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House was also encouraged by what it saw as
flexibility in China's ultimate decision to agree that each nation
would drop the other as a target of intercontinental nuclear
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   To reach the deal, Beijing had to drop its demand that
Washington adopt a ``no-first-use'' policy for its nuclear arsenal
_ a step the Clinton administration, following long-established
U.S. policy, refused to take. Non-nuclear U.S. allies, including
Japan and NATO nations, have depended on U.S. nuclear weapons as a
last resort should they face defeat from conventional forces.
</P>
<P>
   China, which was the first country to make a ``no-first-use''
pledge, viewed its demand that the United States follow suit as a
way of cutting into the Pentagon's clear nuclear advantage. Beijing
also worried that the promise of the U.S. ``nuclear umbrella'' for
Japan constituted what Li Zhaoxing, Chinese ambassador in
Washington, called ``a sort of nuclear threat to China.''
</P>
<P>
   The presidents also approved agreements to:
</P>
<P>
   Strengthen controls on export of ``dual-use'' chemicals, those
that have legitimate commercial uses but also could be weapons
components.
</P>
<P>
   Allow U.S. inspections to make certain that high-technology
exports to China are not diverted into unauthorized military uses
and are not passed on to another country.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said the issue of U.S. export waivers for additional
Chinese launch of American satellites did not come up in the
presidents' talks.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is controversial because of allegations that a U.S.
company aided China in making its missiles more accurate, which
could be a security breach. The company, Loral Space and
Communications, is headed by Bernard Schwartz, the leading
individual contributor to the Democratic National Committee during
the 1996 election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our view is that while there are some instances of
private companies being investigated, that our policy with respect
to satellite launches on Chinese missiles is one that serves the
national interest and has not compromised our security,'' Berger
said.

STARS GO FOR SIZE, ATTITUDE IN DRAFT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not since 1992 have the Stars' selections been so sparse in an
NHL entry draft.
</P>
<P>
   But if 1992 is any indication _ Jere Lehtinen was tabbed at 88th
and Juha Lind at 178th _ the Stars are hoping yesterday's entry
draft in Buffalo, N.Y., will yield at least a couple of NHL
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you can do in any draft is take the ones you think can
make it and hope for the best,'' said Craig Button, Stars director
of scouting. ``We think we were able to get some quality
prospects.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman John Erskine will have the best chance of making it,
although all of the players taken are expected to play at least two
more seasons of junior hockey before even getting a chance to move
to the Stars' affiliate in Kalamazoo, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   The 39th pick overall, Erskine has size (6-foot-4, 200 pounds)
and attitude (205 penalty minutes in 55 games played). NHL Central
Scouting said of Erskine, who plays with London of the Ontario
Hockey League: ``has good size and uses it to play an aggressive
and intimidating style of game ... a hard hitter who punishes
opponents in front of the net ... a lot of desire, eager to
improve.''
</P>
<P>
   The selection, a day after Erskine's 18th birthday on Friday,
was quite a gift.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great, it's the next steppingstone,'' Erskine said.
``I've always wanted to play in the NHL, and to be drafted by a
great organization like Dallas makes it well worth the wait.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars, who had the last pick (27th) in the first round as a
result of having the best regular-season record in the NHL, decided
to hedge their bet by picking up an extra pick. They traded the
27th pick to the New Jersey Devils in exchange for the 39th and
57th picks _ passing up the highly rated Ramzi Abid (50 goals, 266
penalty minutes in 68 games), who went to Colorado at 28th. The
Stars previously had traded away their second-round selection in
this year's draft, their fourth-, fifth- and eighth-round picks,
and Button said getting two quality players was better than taking
someone like Abid.
</P>
<P>
   With the 57th selection, the Stars took speedy winger Tyler
Bouck (pronounced Bowk) from Prince George of the Western Hockey
League. Bouck has two years of junior experience and is a teammate
of 1996 Stars draft pick Joel Kwiatkowski. Bouck had 11 goals and
26 assists in 65 games. He is projected as a hard-working,
third-line winger.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars chose center Gabriel Karlsson with their 86th overall
pick. Karlsson had 11 goals and 15 assists in 27 games last season
with Sweden's HV '71.

IN JASPER, POLICE KEEP KKK AND BLACK PROTESTERS APART BUT NOT
QUIET

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, TEXAS _ Ignoring pleas from the community to stay away,
25 Ku Klux Klan members and about twice that many black protesters
from Houston and Dallas converged Saturday on Jasper, scene of a
racially motivated slaying three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Police were largely successful in keeping the groups apart, with
only occasional skirmishes and two arrests for disturbing the
peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are relieved that no one was injured, there was no property
destroyed and there were only two minor arrests,'' Jasper County
Sheriff Billy Rowles said after the hour-and-a-half rally.
</P>
<P>
   There were times, however, when flaring tempers appeared to
match the 96-degree temperature on Jasper's courthouse square.
</P>
<P>
   Groups of eight or 10 black militants marched several times up
to the red plastic fence barricades that surrounded the area where
18 robed and hooded and seven unrobed Klansmen held Confederate and
other flags and shouted racist slogans.
</P>
<P>
   Before the noon rally got under way, about 50 African-Americans,
mostly members of the New Black Panther Party from Dallas, gathered
at a staging area across the street from the police station, well
east of the courthouse square. About 10 of the men were armed with
rifles and shotguns, which they assured reporters were loaded. They
said they wanted to protect Jasper's black residents from the KKK.
</P>
<P>
   A contingent of leaders went, unarmed, to confront the KKK,
after which the whole entourage marched down some Jasper streets
shouting, ``Black power!''
</P>
<P>
   When several of the armed men attempted to cross the barricades
onto the square, police threw back their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black people, we can take these bastards. We can run over the
damn police and take their ass,'' yelled former Nation of Islam
spokesman Khallid Muhammad in an unsuccessful charge.
</P>
<P>
   Klan leaders said they were there to denounce the slaying of
James Byrd Jr., a 49-year-old black man who was beaten and dragged
behind a pickup for almost three miles on June 7, and to counter
reports that at least two of the three suspects in the case may
have ties to white supremacy groups.
</P>
<P>
   But the Klansmen also took the opportunity to air their racial
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``To hell with the negroes and their special programs,'' shouted
one.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Flinn, imperial wizard of the Vidor-based Knights of the
White Kamellia, complained that a white man had been killed by a
black man a week earlier than Byrd's death ``and nobody claimed
that was a racial crime.''
</P>
<P>
   He said most white men sent to Texas prisons have to join gangs
such as the Aryan Brotherhood to protect themselves from blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In prison you're not going to call a block meeting to work out
racial problems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jasper is part of the invisible empire,'' said Rick Anderson,
grand titan of the Knights of the White Kamellia. ``Make no mistake
about it, this is Klan country.''
</P>
<P>
   His sentiments were not reflected by most people in the racially
mixed crowd of perhaps 100 spectators. Many chanted, ``KKK, go
away!''
</P>
<P>
   Jasper officials had asked residents to stay away, and many said
beforehand they were praying for rain not only to ease a two-month
drought but also to dampen the rally.
</P>
<P>
   There were no showers, but the stay-at-home message apparently
worked for most people in this East Texas timber town of 8,000.
Most of the locals who did attend appeared angry at the spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   Resident John Handy, 73, marched along the streets around the
square during the rally with a sign proclaiming ``Jesus is the
answer.'' He said the Klan and black militant groups were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Out-of-towners listed a variety of reasons for coming. Some had
marched in civil rights protests of the past, others simply were
curious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to see a sad day in Texas history,'' said Sandra
Kanak of Rosenberg, whose family owns a vacation home on nearby Sam
Rayburn Reservoir.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Curry, a 39-year-old bicycle mechanic from Hitchcock,
said he came to Jasper with his video camera to record ``the real
truth'' of the rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``The liberal media don't show it all,'' said Curry, who is
white.
</P>
<P>
   Two college students from Jasper, Joe Hailey, who attends
Abilene Christian University, and Sterling Popejoy, who attends
Texas A&AMP;M, set up a camera on the second floor of a building
Popejoy's father owns on the square. The camera was hooked to a
computer and instantly projected images of the rally onto the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just thought it might be something interesting to see,''
said Hailey.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Butler of Houston, who grew up in Jasper and said she was a
distant cousin of Byrd, held aloft a large American flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted to show them (the Klan) that we are not
intimidated,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Rowles said about 150 officers from at least 10 or 15
different departments _ mainly Texas Rangers and Department of
Public Safety troopers _ were on hand.
</P>
<P>
   The only arrests came at the end of the rally when two men _ one
white and one black _ were arrested in separate incidents on
disturbing the peace charges. Both quickly bonded out, Rowles said.
</P>
<P>
   The platoons of officers and the crowd were matched in size by
the media. News reporters from as far away as Europe converged on
the square.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the KKK that stirred most Jasper residents to anger.
Pauline Leach, 47, screamed threats at Klansmen as they loaded into
cars behind the courthouse to drive out of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cops and them are all the same,'' she said, ``they wear
blue in the daytime and white at night.''
</P>
<P>
   When the rally was over, Rowles commented that he'd ``ruined a
new $65 hat'' with sweat, but said he was glad to have the day
over.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't quite, however. About that time, officers got a radio
report of black militants being along Huff Creek road, where Byrd
was dragged to his death. An officer at the scene requested 20
officers to help him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep a low profile,'' Rowles advised the officers to responded
to the call.
</P>
<P>
   He later said the group's appearance on the road resulted in
nothing more than a traffic jam.

 &HT;    Racial drama plays out in Jasper with two arrests, none hurt
 &HT;    By Denise Gamino and Kim Sue Lia Perkes

<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ A surreal drama of racial hostility played out
on the tree-shaded courthouse square Saturday as white-robed Ku
Klux Klan members rallied and black militants repeatedly tried to
storm the fence protecting the Klan.
</P>
<P>
   State troopers with riot gear repelled the New Black Panther
Party members several times as they tried to reach the 25 Ku Klux
Klan members, who made speeches about white power and ``violent
Negroes.''
</P>
<P>
   The day ended without any injuries but two people were arrested
for disorderly conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom-line is no one was hurt, no property was destroyed,
and no one's civil rights were violated,'' said Jasper County
Sheriff Billy Rowles.
</P>
<P>
   The Klan members cut short their two-hour rally by a half-hour,
only to be rushed by black militants who tried to confront them as
they were getting into their cars. Law officers wrestled a black
man against the trunk of a car, arresting him for disorderly
conduct. During the incident, officers screamed at by-standers and
reporters to stay back .
</P>
<P>
   The spectacle _ which was prompted by the gruesome June 2 murder
of James Byrd Jr. _ drew about 200 onlookers and an equal number of
journalists. One hundred and fifty officers from 15 local, state
and federal agencies were in the Jasper County Courthouse area.
City officials had asked Jasper residents to stay home and ignore
the Klan rally. But some African American residents said they came
to show the Klan they are not intimidated by their tactics and to
tell them to go home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not scared,'' said Mandy West, a Jasper resident, who
taunted the Klan members to take off their masks. ``It's not
Halloween,'' she yelled.
</P>
<P>
   One of the robed Klansmen was Rick Anderson, a property manager
from Austin who is the grand titan of the western province of the
Knights of the White Kamellia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drunken act of violence that took the life of James Byrd
was indeed a disaster,'' he told the crowd. ``What on God's earth
could causes someone to do such a thing?''
</P>
<P>
   The Klan called the rally in Jasper to denounce Byrd's murder
and to make it clear the three white suspects accused of killing
him by dragging him behind a pickup truck were not Klansmen. But
the Klan also had another message: ``White power!'' they shouted
again and again.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 members of the New Black Panther Party came with
rifles, but they were not allowed to bring them near the
courthouse. Police had barricaded a nine-block area around the
courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Before heading to the courthouse, the New Black Panthers
distributed fliers to local residents that said, ``Load your
shotguns. Load your rifles. Load your guns!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sit on your porches, stand in your yards and protect
yourselves and your homes from behind closed doors.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Black Panther party was created in Dallas in the early
1990s, but members of the original Black Panther party of the 1960s
have distanced themselves from the new group because it preaches
anti-white messages and violence. The Black Panther party sued the
New Black Panther Party in 1996 to protect its trademark name and
won a court order to prevent the new group from using the Panther
name or symbol.
</P>
<P>
   At Saturday's rally, the Klan members said they are the
guardians of white rights, which they fear are being diminished by
affirmative action programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The blacks have the NAACP looking after them. The Hispanics
have the LULACs looking after them. And the homosexuals have AIDS
taking care of them,'' said Michael Lowe of Waco, a Texas leader of
the Knights of the KKK.
</P>
<P>
   While about 50 Klan supporters in the courthouse crowd applauded
the Klan speeches and occasionally shouted out for ``White Power,''
most of the onlookers were African Americans heckling the Klan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey hey, go home. The KKK has got to go,'' many yelled in
unison trying to drown out the Klan.
</P>
<P>
   But the Klan claimed they were already home.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Klan country, has been Klan country and will be Klan
country from now on,'' said Darrell Flinn, imperial wizard of
Knights of the White Kamellia.
</P>
<P>
   While city officials deny there is a racial problem in Jasper,
civil rights experts and some black Jasper residents say
discrimination is prevalent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racism is alive and well in East Texas,'' said Mark Potok,
editor the Alabama-based Southern Poverty Law Center's quarterly
journal that tracks white supremacy groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of the deep South,'' he said of Japer, which is
55 percent white and 42 percent black. ``It's not a part of the
West. This was slave-holding Texas. That's why the region is much
blacker than most of Texas.''

BRAZIL BEATS CHILE, 4-1  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Ivan Zamorano, the Chilean striker, had a dream recently
about these World Cup finals. Chile would play Brazil; Chile would
win, 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   Zamorano's subconscious did get one thing right about Saturday
night's second-round game at the Parc des Princes: Chile scored a
goal. The problem was that Brazil scored four, and easily could
have scored more.
</P>
<P>
   Not much went wrong for the defending champions on a cool,
intermittently rainy Saturday evening. After losing to Norway on
Tuesday in a game that mattered mostly to the Norwegians, the
Brazilians started slowly, hearing jeers from their fans throughout
the first 10 minutes, and then gradually acquired ramming speed,
confidence and plenty of space to show off their remarkable
individual skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil found a good way of playing: the way Brazil likes to
play,'' said its coach, Mario Zagallo, whose team will face either
Nigeria or Denmark in the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldo, the striker who was more effective as a decoy than a
scorer in Brazil's first three games, put the ball in the net twice
against the overmatched Chileans. More surprising, so did his less
celebrated roommate, Cesar Sampaio, a defensive midfielder whose
usual role is to make life difficult for opposing strikers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite sitting out the game against the Norwegians, Sampaio now
has as many goals (three) in this tournament as Ronaldo, but
nowhere near as many endorsements or hangers-on. Sampaio played in
the Japanese first division last season but is expected to return
to Brazil and play for Palmeiras next season.
</P>
<P>
   In the 11th minute Saturday night, Sampaio slipped through the
Chilean defense _ not a Herculean task _ and headed home a long
free kick from Dunga without having to worry about outjumping a
fullback. That was because nobody bothered to mark him.
</P>
<P>
   In the 27th minute, Sampaio scored again off a set piece. His
teammate Roberto Carlos, who has one of the sport's most powerful
left legs, blasted a free kick toward the Chilean wall. The ball
ricocheted off the Brazilian Rivaldo to Bebeto, who passed it to
Sampaio, who placed it perfectly into the lower left corner of the
goal with his right foot.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil had a 2-0 lead, but not every Brazilian was content.
While his teammates were gathered around Sampaio celebrating,
Dunga, their captain, approached Ronaldo and apparently said a few
critical words. It was hardly the public dressing down Dunga had
given Bebeto during the first-round match against Morocco for
missing a defensive assignment, but it was a reminder that Dunga
remains concerned about this team's lack of collectivity and
combativity compared with 1994.
</P>
<P>
   After being criticized for his treatment of Bebeto, Dunga
testily vowed to keep quiet against Norway. Brazil lost, and
Saturday night Dunga resumed playing the role of drill sergeant
against the Chileans, who have not won a match in the World Cup
since 1962, but who rallied to tie in each of their three
first-round games.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilians would prove less vulnerable. During the second
minute of injury time in the first half, Ronaldo was brought down
in the penalty box by goalkeeper Nelson Tapia. He converted the
ensuing penalty kick to give Brazil a 3-0 halftime lead. Marcelo
Salas cut that lead to 3-1 in the 68th minute with a header, his
fourth goal of the tournament, but two minutes later, Ronaldo
scored again off a fine pass from the late substitute Denilson.
Ronaldo nearly scored twice more in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronaldo played better than in the other matches, but he can
still give a lot more,'' said Zagallo, who far preferred his team's
play in the second half, although it scored only once.
</P>
<P>
   The Chileans were short three key midfielders Saturday night _
Francisco Rojas, Moises Villaroel, and Nelson Parraguez _ who all
had to miss the game because of yellow cards received in the first
round. Coach Nelson Acosta clearly lacks depth, and the Chileans
were only able to control the flow of play in the opening minutes.
``After they scored, things got difficult for us in a hurry,''
Zamorano said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, Zagallo was a player on the team that defeated Chile in
the semifinals. Thirty-six years later, he was the winning coach,
but he made it clear after the match that defeating Chile is hardly
his ultimate goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is a happy day,'' he said, for a change looking like he
meant it as he faced reporters. ``And I would like to be here in
front of you again on July 12.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be the date of the World Cup final.

ANTI-U.S. INFLUENCE UP NORTH HURTS HITCHCOCK AT AWARD TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
The award is supposed to go to ``the head NHL coach adjudged to
have contributed the most to his team's success.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Which makes it a no-brainer.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hitchcock contributed mightily to whatever success the Stars
attained this season. He was the glue that held the team together
through thick, thin and Bryan Marchment. He was the anchor that
kept the team playing at a high level for seven months, amid an
epidemic of sprains, strains and arthroscopic surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   The Jack Adams Award is supposed to be based on accomplishments
during the regular season. And who accomplished more during the
1997-98 season than the team that was 49-22-11 and won the
Presidents' Trophy with 109 points?
</P>
<P>
   Yet when the balloting for the Adams Award was announced at the
NHL's annual gala last week, Hitchcock finished neither first nor
second.
</P>
<P>
   Good ol' boy Pat Burns of Boston was named the winner, with that
icon of Montreal's past glories, Larry Robinson of the Los Angeles
Kings, coming in second.
</P>
<P>
   Hitch finished third. Somebody, therefore, needs to help with
the math here. Team finishes first equals coach finishing third?
</P>
<P>
   What next _ a glowing puck?
</P>
<P>
   This is not to disparage Burns, whose Bruins made a 30-point
leap in the standings. Nor is it to imply that Robinson, one of my
old heroes, didn't do marvelous things in resuscitating the Forum's
Other Team.
</P>
<P>
   But Burns inherited a Boston team that should have won 40 games
the season before. He is like the service man summoned in the
middle of the winter night, who pokes around the family furnace and
announces, ``Your pilot light was out. That'll be $250.''
</P>
<P>
   For this, you get named coach of the year?
</P>
<P>
   No, because the reasons for snubbing Hitchcock go deeper than
that.
</P>
<P>
   To the average Canadian, hockey is more than seven months of
headlines and Don Cherry's sport coats. Canadians adore hockey with
a passion unequaled in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, we have Cubs fans. Packers fans. Bulls fans. Red Wings fans.
</P>
<P>
   But Canadians are hockey fans, and when one Canadian team is
ousted from the NHL playoffs _ as they invariably do lately _
Canadians pull for another.
</P>
<P>
   And Canadians worry. They have seen teams in Quebec City and
Winnipeg move south to warmer and wealthier climes and nearly saw
the Edmonton Oilers follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   Canadians worry that their six teams have to compete for their
most critical commodity _ players _ in U.S. dollars while earning
revenues in Canadian dollars. They worry that most of the 20 U.S.
teams are in larger markets. And they worry that the average club
payroll of the cost-conscious Canadian teams is $8.4 million less
than the U.S. teams' average.
</P>
<P>
   What's this have to do with Hitchcock?
</P>
<P>
   His owner, Tom Hicks. And all that Hicks, the Stars and the city
of Dallas represent.
</P>
<P>
   To the part of the league that looks at things through maple
leaf-clouded glasses, Hitchcock coached a rich, store-bought team
that represents all that is ``wrong'' with today's NHL. Free agents
want to play for the Stars. A new arena is on the way.
</P>
<P>
   It might be silly to think that a voter would cast a ballot
against Hitchcock for all these symbolic reasons. But let me
suggest that those reasons have contributed to the mind-set that
some have about the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Hitch can't win. He works for the league's Steinbrenner. More
poignantly, the NHL's Jerry Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The Adams Award is selected by the NHL Broadcasters Association.
Hmm _ does Dale Hansen belong to the NHL Broadcasters Association?
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock actually had seven more first-place votes than
Robinson in the balloting. But Burns was a runaway winner with 306
points to Robinson's 149 and Hitchcock's 123. Outrageously, 52 of
the 87 ballots did not name Hitch.
</P>
<P>
   Let's not blame Canadians. Let's blame the mind-set that compels
the league to think that all Hitchcock has to do is ring up the
cash register and make up the lineup card.
</P>
<P>
   It will be curious to see what happens when Team Canada has to
pick its next coach for the World Championships and 2002 Winter
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious choice is a no-brainer.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hitchcock has played a huge role in turning around this
franchise. He has earned the respect of his players, and his record
speaks volumes. He is a great story.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad the NHL broadcasters keep missing it.

HATFUL OF HOPE FOR FORMER CHAMPION BULL RIDER JEROME DAVIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT HOFFMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ On a steamy Saturday night, approximately
8,000 rodeo fans screamed a welcome loud enough to shatter glass
when legendary bull rider Tuff Hedeman pushed wheelchair-bound
Jerome Davis across the dirt arena floor.
</P>
<P>
   After Davis was introduced under a spotlight in the darkened
coliseum arena, the injured former world champion slowly raised his
hand over his western hat and formed a fist.
</P>
<P>
   The gesture symbolized Davis' rodeo life of defying the odds.
Three years ago, he became the first bull rider with a residence
east of the Mississippi to win a world title. But three months ago,
he began facing the challenge of his life when the bull, Knock 'Em
Out John, broke Davis' neck during a show in Fort Worth, leaving
the 25-year-old paralyzed from the chest down and with soaring
medical bills that could pile up to $1 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy may have shortened Davis' career by 10 years, what
would be comparable to permanently sidelining a running back like
the Cowboys' Emmitt Smith after five 1,000-yard seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see it as just another injury,'' said Davis, who firmly
believes that he will walk again. ``During the years that I
competed, I had my share of injuries that sidelined me from bull
riding for a period of time. So I look at this one the same way. I
don't sit back and mope about it. But unlike the other injuries,
this one is just going to take a little longer to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   The dynamic energy from last weekend's Jerome Davis Championship
Challenge IV in Charlotte might have been part of the healing
process. It was Davis' first appearance at a rodeo show since the
crippling injury.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is a founding father of Professional Bull Riders, an
organization that conducts a lucrative national tour of shows
devoted solely to bull riding. The association has sanctioned the
annual bull riding event in Charlotte since 1995 in honor of Davis.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, Davis attended as a spectator and provided color
commentary from the announcer's stand as each competitor prepared
to ride. Then, Knock 'Em Out John appeared in a chute. It was his
time to buck.
</P>
<P>
   After the bull exploded out of the gate and unceremoniously
dumped its rider in a few seconds, Davis informed the crowd that
this was the animal that crippled him. But that revelation came
only after the ride had ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going to build the bull up by saying that this was
the bull that hurt me while the cowboy was getting ready to ride,''
Davis said. ``All that would have done was put negative thoughts in
the rider's mind. With me, it was just a deal that happened by
accident. I've had a lot of bulls hit me in the face and I've been
knocked out several times, so it was something that could have
happened on any other bull.''
A rodeo camp Davis was reared in the small North Carolina town of
Archdale, a suburb of Greensboro.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he lives in a two-story white house on a hill in a
sparsely populated area. The house is surrounded by large trees
that hang over decorative wooden furniture and wagon wheels. From
the back of the house, a wooden deck overlooks a meadow with a
rodeo arena and lush grassland for livestock.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Davis has purchased rodeo livestock and
conducted weekly bull-riding jackpots at the small ranch. The
house, which now is equipped with a wooden walkway for wheelchairs,
has been in Davis' family for more than four decades.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the house, the living room table is a glass-covered wagon
wheel with gold-and-silver belt buckles embedded between the
spokes. Atop another coffee table, there's a classic photo of the
late, legendary bull rider Freckles Brown, who stunned the rodeo
world when he won the world title in 1962 while in his early 40s.
</P>
<P>
   The walls are decorated with rodeo posters and back numbers from
high-profile rodeo shows. But the memento that stands out is a
framed collection of color photos, one of each of the 10 rides and
the scorecard from the 1995 National Finals Rodeo when Davis
secured the world title.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are bull horns and deer horns mounted on the
walls, and a ``Welcome Home Jerome'' banner hangs from a staircase.
As Davis sits in his wheelchair and watches TV on a large screen,
there's a sense that he hasn't forsaken rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I did,'' Davis said of bull riding. ``Everything
revolved around rodeo. That will be with me until I die.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the rodeo memorabilia, the house is stocked with
medical equipment, such as wheelchairs, a specially designed bed
and pill bottles.
</P>
<P>
   It takes Davis' fiancee, Tiffany Brady, 23, up to three hours to
prepare Davis for a public appearance. The daily routine includes
taking Davis' blood pressure, giving him about 20 pills, helping
him with range-of-motion exercises and bathing him. Each night, she
rolls Davis over in bed every two or three hours to prevent him
from getting bed sores.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I did was jump in and began helping him the first night he
was sick,'' Brady said. ``I've been like a nurse ever since. When
someone becomes paralyzed, it's a 24-hour-a-day job. It's not like
you can just jump up and go somewhere. And when you put clothes on
him, it's like picking up 140 pounds of dead weight, but I've
learned how to manage.''
</P>
<P>
   Brady, the daughter of a rodeo livestock contractor, has kept an
upbeat attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many girls who are 23 have only gone and hung out in bars,''
she said. ``But I've gone all over the country to rodeos with
Jerome. I just think of what most girls haven't gotten to do and
how fortunate I am to have done all of the things that we've
done.''
A crushing blow Brady was in Fort Worth on March 14 when Davis was
injured at the Tuff Hedeman Championship Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Davis had to face Knock 'Em Out John in the first round. About
five seconds into the ride, Davis lost control of the bull and
tumbled over the front of the animal. His head collided with the
bull's horns, knocking Davis unconscious. Then, he was thrown head
first into the arena dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Davis had no feeling in his legs when he was examined by the
Justin Sportsmedicine team at Will Rogers Memorial Coliseum. He was
taken out of the arena on a stretcher and rushed to Fort Worth's
John Peter Smith Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``A little bit of it I can remember,'' Davis said. ``I can
remember Tiffany talking with me. I said, `I can't feel my legs'
and she said, `You're just numb.' I said, `I really can't feel
anything.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Davis had fractured the sixth and seventh vertebrae at the base
of his neck. After he underwent surgery the next day to stabilize
the spine and neck, medical officials said he was not expected to
walk again.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Davis has limited use of his arms and fingers. He cannot
feed himself, but he can adjust his cowboy hat. Brady signs Davis'
name for autograph seekers.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' father, Carson, said his son always has been aware of the
potential danger of climbing on 2,000-pound bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understood that this could happen when he started riding,''
the elder Davis said. ``Sometimes you have to sacrifice _ you don't
think this type of thing is going to happen, but it did to
Jerome.''
</P>
<P>
   But these types of injuries do happen, and rodeo cowboys think
about them all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody who rides knows it's very dangerous,'' said K.J.
Pletcher, a bull rider who was Davis' traveling partner. ``I'm just
glad that it didn't kill Jerome.''
The wonder boy During Davis' childhood years in North Carolina, the
thought of gaining a spot on the high-profile rodeo circuit was
like conquering the unrivaled bull.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis overcame the low expectations that may have deterred
many Eastern rodeo cowboys from rising to stardom. There are few
big-time rodeos along the Eastern seaboard, few opportunities to
see the best in the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I've opened some doors where they could see the
light,'' Davis said of every aspiring bull rider in the East. ``I
hope to get them knowledgeable so they can go on. There are a lot
of guys who can.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis began competing in rodeos at age 11. He developed his bull
riding skills as a teen-ager; his father produced amateur weekly
bull riding shows at the family ranch.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Davis, who operates a feed store and announces rodeos,
said North Carolina offers an abundance of amateur and minor-league
rodeos. But he encouraged his son to dream bigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have tons of guys who come to our bull riding on Thursdays
that have some girl on their mind that they want to impress,''
Carson Davis said. ``Around here, rodeo promoters make local heroes
out of these boys, and they end up staying here. But that wasn't
Jerome's goal. He had to move on. He had the National Finals and a
world championship on his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   During his high school years, the younger Davis competed in the
International Professional Rodeo Association, billed as the sport's
most prominent minor league. When Davis was a senior, he gained
respect and attention at the IPRA's finals in Oklahoma City by
winning the average _ posting the highest aggregate score on five
rides.
</P>
<P>
   That helped him earn a rodeo scholarship at Odessa College, a
two-year school in the West Texas city known for its rodeo team. He
won the national collegiate bull riding title as a freshman in
1992, and that year he moved on to the Professional Rodeo Cowboys
Association tour to rub shoulders with world champions such as
Hedeman, Ty Murray and Jim Sharp.
</P>
<P>
   ``The closest that I'd ever seen them ride was on TV,'' Davis
said. ``The first time I actually saw them, I was riding against
them. It almost didn't seem real.''
</P>
<P>
   During his first year on the PRCA circuit, Davis was sidelined
for several months with broken ribs and failed to qualify for the
1992 National Finals Rodeo in Las Vegas. But he finished in the top
five each of the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Davis won the world title in a race that was not
decided until the last bull had bucked, edging out Terry Don West.
Today, Davis has more than $1 million in earnings in the PBR and
PRCA, five National Finals Rodeo berths and four qualifications to
the PBR championships, also in Las Vegas.
Overwhelming support Though he is confined to a wheelchair and has
to endure hours of rehabilitation and medical treatment each day,
Davis says he's very fortunate to have received overwhelming
support from his family and fans.
</P>
<P>
   The fan appeal is apparent just by clicking onto the
Professional Bull Riders Web site on the Internet; it has listed
updates since Davis was injured and contains a form to send e-mail
messages to him. Davis has received more than 40,000 messages via
the Web site, PBR media officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very encouraging,'' Davis said. ``The responses just keep
coming from all over. When I see so many, I don't know what to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   Bull riding officials also are carefully helping Davis. Randy
Bernard, the PBR's chief executive officer, said PBR is planning to
hire Davis to help anchor a planned feature program about bull
riding on The Nashville Network and to help announce bull riding
shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerome will have a lot of friends the next two years because
of all of the hype about his injury,'' Bernard said. ``But after
that, the PBR needs to step to the plate and strongly support him
for the rest of his life. He will stay very connected with the
PBR.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Pack and Hedeman, who co-produce the Tuff Hedeman
Championship Challenge in Fort Worth each March, said they plan to
show Davis the ropes of managing bull riding shows for the PBR. For
the past two years, the Hedeman event has been voted by competitors
as the association's top regular-season show.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also plans to continue raising rodeo livestock. Last
weekend, long-time stock Texas stock producer Fred Cordell of
Childress hauled a small bull all the way to North Carolina for
Davis. The small bull was fathered by Grasshopper, the top bull in
the PRCA in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Davis will focus on raising this bull to be a top challenger and
a breeder of top-caliber bulls, another way of making an impact in
professional rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Jerome rode bulls, he had a never-give-up attitude, and
he will keep that same attitude as a rancher or a stock
contractor,'' said Hedeman, the association's president from Morgan
Mill. ``He's the type of guy who will be successful. If he never
rides again, it won't keep him from being successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of guys who ride great, but Jerome is a guy
who has brought the sport to where it is today. He's the type of
guy who would do the little things like sign autographs or get up
at 6 in the morning to do a TV show. As bull riders, we were able
to live our dreams, and now that Jerome is sidelined, we want him
to stay involved and be able to provide a livelihood for his
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who had only $20,000 worth of insurance from the bull
riding association, also has benefited from many fund-raisers since
the accident. Last weekend, more than $65,000 was raised at an
auction in Charlotte that included memorabilia from world-class
rodeo riders. In Fort Worth in April, more than $130,000 was raised
at an auction that included memorabilia from NASCAR drivers. And
Davis received a $26,000 check from Winston Cup star Bobby Labonte
after Labonte won a race in Darlington, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Davis has received more than $300,000 in contributions,
his mother, Pam Simmons, said. And other fund-raisers are planned,
including a benefit at the PBR's Nov. 6-8 World Finals in Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   At home, Davis receives assistance from his mother and father,
and his stepmother, Vicki. Even before the accident, the three were
the best of friends and traveled to rodeos together to watch Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``'We've always been very close,'' Vicki Davis said. ``The first
time that Jerome got seriously hurt \Rin Reno, Nev., in 1992\S, I
drove Pam and Carson to catch the plane. When he got hurt last
March, I kept things going out here, took all of the phone calls
and handled TV interviews while Carson and Pam traveled to Fort
Worth to be with Jerome.''
</P>
<P>
   All that support has helped Davis remain optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very fortunate that I've gotten good people behind me,''
Davis said. ``It's easy for me not to be bitter about what happened
because there are many people who are injured like I have been who
don't really have anyone to take care of them. It's a whole
different ordeal for them. So it's easy for me to say that I'm
optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the odds of recovering his mobility are considered very
slim by medical officials, Davis said his Christian faith has
spurred his confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pray every night that I can come out of this,'' Davis said
``I have faith that I can walk again through medical help or
through the Lord's healing power.''

 &HT;    Police maintain order at Klan rally
 &HT;    By Mitch Mitchell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ The 25 robed individuals standing on the Jasper
County Courthouse lawn where many in this town had prayed for
healing two weeks earlier looked almost like extras in a scene from
a B-movie.
</P>
<P>
   They called each other names like Grand Wizard, Grand Titan,
Dragon and Knight.
</P>
<P>
   What many of the residents here feared actually happened. The Ku
Klux Klan had come to town and its opposite number, The New Black
Panthers, were also here vowing to protect the town's black
residents from Klan intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake about it,'' Rick Anderson, Grand Titan of the
Knights of the White Kamellia, said. ``This is Klan country.''
</P>
<P>
   Klan members were there to disavow any connection with those
involved in the slaying of James Byrd Jr., a 49-year-old black man
who was chained behind a pickup and dragged for three miles early
June 7.
</P>
<P>
   During the dragging, Byrd's head and right shoulder were torn
from his body. Three white men have been arrested in connection
with what authorities have said is a racially motivated killing.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Russell Brewer, 31, of Sulphur Springs, and Jasper
residents Shawn Allen Berry and John William King, both 23, have
been charged with murder and are being held in Jasper County jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fellows that did this were not a part of any Klan group
that we know of,'' a Klansman called Nathan told a crowd of more
than 200 media spectators and 200 onlookers.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Klan and approximately 20 Panthers decried the crime as
brutal. Mutual agreement between the two groups ended there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New Black Panthers are arming the violent black youth in
the area,'' Anderson said. ``Now the good white people of Jasper
are in jeopardy. ... Now if one of you ends up dead for the crime
of being white, will the nation grieve and mourn over your mangled
corpse? I don't think so.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one will even notice you're gone. No one noticed when our
white neighbor Mr. McQueen was murdered at the hand of a Negro just
one week prior to Mr. Byrd's death. You can bet that no one will
remember your name either. One thing we can draw from that is the
life of a Negro has far more value than the life of a white.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Jerry McQueen, 37, a Jasper white man, was beat
to death with a blunt instrument. Donald Kinnebrew, 34, a Jasper
black man, has been arrested and charged with murder in connection
with the crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Klan is a coward organization,'' Minister Khallid Abdul
Muhammad said before the confrontation between the two groups.
``They hide their faces behind sheets. They used to be called night
riders, because that is when they attacked people. They attacked
when they outnumbered their victims 100-to-1. They ambushed people,
tied them up with chains and lynched them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or they hide behind the badges of sheriff's officers and wear
the black robes of judges. They don't want to fight with us. It's
no fun when the black men have guns.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Black Panthers tried several times to penetrate the
barricades set up by authorities but were rebuffed each time. About
one hour into the Klan rally, Quanell X, leader of the
Houston-based Black Muslim Movement, gathered the black people
around him and asked if they were ready to fight.
</P>
<P>
   A cheer went up and a voice whispered softly from the inner
circle:'' Let's go get the guns.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Black Panthers, followed by dozens of media and
onlookers marched down the street while Texas Department of Public
Safety troopers formed a skirmish line about a block away from the
rally.
</P>
<P>
   The New Black Panthers were prohibited from bringing their guns
into the area where the Klansmen rallied, and meanwhile authorities
were escorting the white and black robed men and women into their
cars.
</P>
<P>
   Several times the New Black Panthers ran at the cars, with
people throwing ice and at least one man throwing rocks at a car
carrying the Klansmen away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran those suckers out of here,'' Muhammad shouted
victoriously along with others. Then the New Black Panthers marched
down the street, followed again by media and bystanders, fists
raised in the air, cursing the Klan.
</P>
<P>
   Not a shot was fired; not a blow was landed. Law enforcement
rarely raised a hand except to make an arrest of a man carrying a
knife and to restrain a man throwing rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the local people were at some other location during the
Klan rally. Local government officials and ministers cautioned
people to stay away from the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   But not all stayed away. Ray Lewis, pastor of Faith Temple
Church of God In Christ, told those who stayed behind after the
rally that Jasper officials were being hypocritical about the
town's situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y'all say pray at the courthouse and let the healing begin,''
Lewis said. ``In short, words coming from the officials are saying
go home and go to sleep. ... I'm not trying to tell them what to
say. They're our elected officials, they should know what to say.
But what they should stop saying is there is no problem here.''

 &HT;    Renewed Sorenstam primed for '98 Open
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOHLER, Wisc. -- This week's U.S. Women's Open at the Blackwolf
Run Golf Course in Kohler, Wis., has a stiff challenge ahead. If it
wishes to match last year's tournament for engaging story lines, it
better get started with the subplots early in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Pumpkin Ridge in 1997, in this order, was:
</P>
<P>
   Annika Sorenstam's attempt to win an unprecedented third
straight U.S Women's Open.
</P>
<P>
   The resurgence of Nancy Lopez, who turned the corner after
turning the big Four-Oh, won in Atlanta, and seemed prepared to
capture the one championship that has eluded her.
</P>
<P>
   The shocking development that saw Sorenstam not only fail to win
again, but even fail to make the cut.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-foot putt that slid by the cup on the 72nd hole,
thwarting Lopez once again.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of England's tiny Alison Nicholas, who, while
unfamiliar to American golf audiences, experienced the week of her
life, winning the U.S. Women's Open with a tournament-record score
of 10-under par.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, much has changed. The Swedes were dominant at the
beginning of the LPGA year _ without Sorenstam to assist them.
Liselotte Neumann and Helen Alfredsson each won twice, with
Sorenstam needing five months to secure a victory.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam is fourth on the LPGA money list with $387,765,
significantly behind leader Donna Andrews ($525,944), but she
enters this Women's Open ($1.5 million purse, $267,500 to the
champion) with significantly less pressure on her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Open (in 1995) was the first time I won in the U.S., so
it's very special to me,'' Sorenstam said during this week's
ShopRite Classic in advance of Blackwolf Run. ``You need to play
the best you can at the Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was a little difficult,'' she said. ``The only thing
on my mind was three-peat, three-peat, three-peat, and it got me
away from my thinking and my game. I missed the cut, and I hadn't
done that in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   She feels renewed from her win at the Michelob Light Classic in
St. Louis on June 7 as she enters the most significant tournament
in women's golf.
</P>
<P>
   Missing a cut should be her most distant thought. Since winning
the 1995 Open, she has missed only two cuts in 48 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lot last year, and I'll be ready to play next
week,'' said Sorenstam, who is third in LPGA scoring at 70.11,
behind Andrews (70.04) and Karrie Webb (69.69). ``I just have to
remember to play shot by shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, 41, promises to be the fan favorite once again at
Blackwolf Run, a venue unfamiliar to most of the 140 players.
</P>
<P>
   A former regional site of the Andersen Consulting World
Championship of Golf, it is, by Pete Dye standards, a relatively
benign property.
</P>
<P>
   Typically quick USGA greens might help Lopez, who has struggled
with her putting much of the year. Lately, she has been drawing a
line on her ball to help with alignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to get your golf game just right for the Open,'' Lopez
said, getting a jump on some visualization. ``I'd like to walk down
the 18th fairway Sunday with a two- or three-shot lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The U.S. Women's Open received a record 925 entries this
year, with 79 qualifiers joining 61 exempt players. ... Savannah's
Hollis Stacy, a three-time champion, was among the qualifiers,
shooting a 72 at the Broadmoor in Colorado Springs, a former Open
site.

STATS SAY SKIP AWAY IS UNDER-APPRECIATED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Had Skip Away raced 40 years ago, his appeal might
have been described in terms of his jackhammer stride, his
super-equine durability and his owner's motherly devotion.
</P>
<P>
   But these are the '90s, and in horse racing as much as in
two-legged sports, hero-makers have largely given up poetry in
favor of statistics. So the case for Skip Away as one of the great
thoroughbreds in recent history is based not on his style but on
his numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers like these: 125, 122, 121 and 120. And these:
negative-2, 0, 0, 0, 0-\ and 0-\.
</P>
<P>
   Meaningless to laymen but familiar to sophisticated
horseplayers, those are Skip Away's best performances as summed up
by two popular varieties of speed figures, the Beyer figures that
appear in the Daily Racing Form and the popular Thoro-Graph
figures. The numbers agree: Skip Away is a superstar.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most underrated horse of all time,'' declared Thoro-Graph
sheets creator Jerry Brown, who believes Skip Away deserves the
same acclaim that Cigar received during his 16-race winning streak
in 1994-96.
</P>
<P>
   The widespread use of speed figures, beginning with the
publication of Andy Beyer's how-to book ``Picking Winners'' in
1975, has been the biggest advance in the objective appraisal of a
racehorse's performance. The Beyer figures are based on the horse's
clocking in a given race and adjustments for the apparent condition
of the track. The sheets _ Brown's and Len Ragozin's original
version _ include other factors such as wind velocity, how much
weight the horse carried and how much ground the horse lost in the
turns.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, accurate speed figures allow handicappers to
compare horses who have raced at different distances, on different
track surfaces and in different weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
   On the Beyer scale, higher numbers are better. The winners'
figures for the past six runnings of the Breeders' Cup Classic, the
nation's biggest race for older horses, range from 114 to 120. The
120 belonged to Skip Away, whose Classic victory at Hollywood Park
in November accounted for one of his four ratings of 120 or higher
in the past 13 months.
</P>
<P>
   On the Thoro-Graph scale, lower numbers are better. Zero is
supposed to be the mark of a champion. Skip Away has earned almost
nothing but zeros since a disappointing effort at Saratoga in
August.
</P>
<P>
   His trainer, Sonny Hine, likes to brag about how much the
``figure men'' love Skip Away. And he's right, they do love him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a horse runs that fast, it generally knocks him out,''
said Brown, referring to the classic sheets-player's theory that
horses ``bounce'' _ regress _ after hard efforts. ``Skip Away runs
'em every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown contrasted Skip Away with Gentlemen, his chief rival among
seven opponents in the $1 million Hollywood Gold Cup today at
Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Gentlemen runs a big one, he gets time between races (to
recover),'' Brown said. ``But Skip Away, three weeks later, he's
back. He's a machine.''
</P>
<P>
   To find another machine like him, Brown believes, you have to go
back nearly two decades to Spectacular Bid, the '79 Kentucky Derby
winner and '80 Horse of the Year. To find a significantly greater
machine, Brown says, you must go back 30 years to Dr. Fager, whose
'68 world record for the mile stood for 29 years.
</P>
<P>
   Of Dr. Fager, Brown says, ``In terms of the times he ran and the
weight he carried, he was a freak. He might be the greatest of all
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Fager earned a series of negative-2s. Skip Away earned his
lone negative-2 for the '97 Pimlico Special _ in which he raced
wide and finished second to Gentlemen.
</P>
<P>
   So, if Skip Away gets less credit than he deserves, why would
that be so? Because, Brown thinks, he came along in the shadow of
Cigar. People just weren't ready to embrace another ``superhorse''
so soon.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, until last fall, there was good reason not to place
Skip Away among the best horses of the year, let alone past
decades. He lost his only meeting with Gentlemen while carrying
three pounds less than the winner. He was outrun by Formal Gold in
four of their six meetings, including the only meeting at level
weights.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, I voted for 5-year-old Gentlemen for the championship
for the 4-and-up division and would have put 4-year-old Formal Gold
ahead of 4-year-old Skip Away as well.
</P>
<P>
   But starting with the Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont Park in
New York last fall, Skip Away has run off six consecutive victories
and is a legitimate favorite to make it seven in a row by turning
the tables on Gentlemen today.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away's opponents haven't been the greatest during this
streak. But the numbers suggest that these days even the greatest
would have a hard time beating him. &QL;

VOTERS HATE CONGRESSIONAL PORK BUT WANT LAWMAKERS TO BRING HOME
BACON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Many of the tears being shed on Capitol Hill after the
Supreme Court's rejection of the presidential line-item veto may be
crocodile tears. As fiscal experiments go, it may have cost even
its staunchest supporters more in political capital than it saved
in tax money.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Moore, director of fiscal policy studies for the Cato
Institute, estimates the savings from presidential line-item vetoes
at $2 billion over five years. Given that federal spending will be
about $9 trillion during this time, $2 billion hardly amounts to a
rounding error in Washington's grand fiscal scheme of things. It
wouldn't, for that matter, amount to more than a small percentage
of the net worth of Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, most Americans consider $2 billion a lot of money.
Most, however, don't think about such a huge sum in the context of
how many taxpayer-hours must be worked to generate $2 billion in
tax revenues. The magnitude of federal spending is so large that
average folks can't relate to the size of its expenditures in a
practical way.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as Moore points out, the savings achieved so far has
been mostly from pork appropriations. This makes the political
calculus of the line-item veto a tricky proposition. On the one
hand, pork-barrel spending is traditionally reviled as the most
cynically deployed and least utilitarian form of largess. On the
other hand, it's immensely popular with those who get it. This is
why legislators on both sides of the aisle use it to buy votes and
reward allies.
</P>
<P>
   Moore laments the fact that the president won't get to wield the
item veto on this year's highway bill, which he sees as a monument
to both pork and the need it creates for the line-item veto. The
bill contains a record 1,500 pork projects, Moore says, or about
``three slabs of bacon'' for each congressional district.
</P>
<P>
   One person's pork, however, is another's economic sustenance,
which is why so many Americans enthusiastically embrace this
particular form of wealth redistribution, even though they profess
contempt for it. Although the line-item veto was a priority in the
GOP's ``Contract With America,'' enthusiasm for it probably has
waned even among its hard-core Republican supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The degree of residual support will become more evident when
congressional champions of the concept begin their push to try to
change the law in a way the courts will find constitutional. The
response will be a good gauge of how many in Congress think it's a
luxury they can afford and still get re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever wondered what forms the more egregious examples of
pork take? Moore lists a few worth pondering. This year's budget,
for instance, contained nearly $300,000 for research on how to
enhance the flavor of roasted peanuts and $150,000 for the National
Center for Peanut Competitiveness. Some $250,000 was appropriated
for research on pickles. New Orleans got $2 million to refurbish a
streetcar named Desire.
</P>
<P>
   Some may find this outrageous, but remember: The areas where
such money will be spent hail the winning of such largess as a boon
to the local economy. Business, civic and political leaders in
Kansas City and elsewhere put a high premium on their legislators
bringing home the bacon. This is why some fiscal conservatives may
be secretly breathing a sigh of relief and thanking the Supremes.

VOTE FOR ME OR STAY HOME, MAURO TELLS TEXAS DEMOCRATS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAY ROOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Shunned by members of his own party and trailing
in the polls, Democrat Garry Mauro urged like-minded candidates to
get behind his campaign for governor Saturday and gave this blunt
message to the non-believers: ``Stay home.''
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by about 150 candidates and activists on the stage at
the Texas Democratic Convention, Mauro invited all Democratic
candidates to ``walk with me and carry the Democratic ticket to
victory in 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you're not for a $5,000 pay raise (for teachers), don't
walk with me,'' Mauro said. ``And if you're not for reducing class
sizes, stay home, don't walk with me. And if you're not for the
right to choose your own doctor, I don't want you to walk with
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauro's feisty speech underscored the uphill challenge he faces
in unseating popular Republican Gov. George W. Bush, a challenge
made even more difficult by Mauro's lack of overt support from his
Democratic colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not only Mauro who faces a steep challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats frankly acknowledged as their convention wrapped
up that the party is at a crossroads and must change and recruit
new blood to regain prominence in a state that has seen a shift to
the Republican Party in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   One such change came Saturday, when Democrats _ by voice vote _
selected former Republican Molly Beth Malcolm as party chairwoman.
Malcolm, the first woman to head the state party, replaces Houston
lawyer and businessman Bill White, who is retiring after 21/2
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to expand our grassroots,'' said Malcolm, of
Texarkana. ``That means we're going to attract more young people to
the party. That means we need to reach out to independents and,
yes, Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Mattox, running to get his old job back as attorney general,
was more explicit about the need to rejuvenate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Democrats, despite all the pretty speeches, have to learn a
few things. We do not win with 43 percent,'' Mattox said, referring
to the percentage of people who call themselves Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't worship at the altar of the New Deal any longer.
That's something from the past. We must move forward to the future
is what we must do.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mauro, moving forward means knocking on lots of doors. He
vowed to ``knock on 1 million doors by Labor Day,'' and said that,
with help from activists, he could knock on a million more.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' land commissioner since 1983, Mauro was swept into office
the same year Ann Richards was elected state treasurer, Jim
Hightower became agriculture commissioner and Mattox was elected
attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Now, almost 16 years later, Mauro is the only one who holds
elective office in Texas. Polls show he will have a tough time
avoiding the fate of his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent Texas Poll, Mauro is trailing Bush by 53
percentage points. Mauro disputed the poll, saying he is probably
closer to 30 percentage points behind, but he acknowledged that the
survey ``hurt me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are discouraged,'' he said. ``It's a demoralizing
poll.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, which Mauro began after delegates heard the theme
song from the film ``Rocky,'' the veteran Democrat pointed to
come-from-behind victories by his political idol and longtime
friend, President Clinton, as proof that he can pull off an upset.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro also touted his signature program at the Land Office, the
acclaimed beach clean-up efforts. And the Democratic nominee
harshly criticized Bush for supporting a voluntary program to
reduce emissions at ``grandfathered'' industrial plants, his veto
of the Patient Protection Act in 1995 and his support of a
low-level radioactive waste dump in West Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's out of touch with ordinary Texas families,'' Mauro said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said Mauro's showing in
the polls shows ``who's out of touch.''
</P>
<P>
   While scores of candidates joined Mauro on stage, including
Mattox and Richard Raymond, the Democratic nominee for land
commissioner, two were notable for their absence.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Hobby, the Democratic comptroller candidate, and John
Sharp, running for lieutenant governor, left the convention after
delivering speeches a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Hobby was with his family yesterday, but ``would have been on
that stage,'' had he still been in San Antonio, said campaign
spokeswoman Margaret Justus. Still, neither Hobby nor Sharp has
openly endorsed Mauro by name.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Hobby was specifically endorsing Mauro, Justus said,
``Paul Hobby has said he is endorsing the ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharp spokesman Kelly Fero said Sharp, the state comptroller, is
making no endorsements in statewide offices. Fero said Sharp agrees
with Mauro's call for a teachers' pay raise, although he couldn't
commit to Mauro's specific figure of $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   He also said Sharp supports reduced class sizes and doctor
choice, though they could differ on significant details. Fero said
Mauro's challenge to fellow Democrats is not important.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many important issues facing Texas today,'' Fero
said. ``This isn't one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauro said the lack of explicit support for candidates who
challenge popular incumbents is nothing new, and he predicted that
Democrats will support him as the November election draws near.
</P>
<P>
   He said his message to Sharp and Hobby is that ``everyone has
their own race to run.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to knock on a million doors, and they are welcome to
join me,'' Mauro said. ``They will. It's just a matter of time.''

ANALYSIS OF U.S. SOCCER'S FAILURE AND FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ It was a shame, Tab Ramos was saying, that nowhere in
the United States' performance in France was there evidence of the
strides American soccer has taken since the last World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Sampson might not agree he seemed to have seen signs of
growth everywhere he looked but Tab, in this instance, appears to
have gotten to the heart of what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   What was so disappointing wasn't that the Americans failed to
win nobody in his right mind expected them to reach the second
round, although triumph over Iran would have been nice it was how
they failed.
</P>
<P>
   Miserably.
</P>
<P>
   At no point during the past two weeks OK, at one point, the
first 20 minutes of the second half against Germany did Sampson's
Army appear the least bit capable of the magic it employed to knock
off Argentina in 1995 or Brazil back in February. There was no
cohesion, no creativity, no spark, and for once the stats tell the
whole story: One goal, no wins, 32nd place.
</P>
<P>
   Disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, it appears an honest appraisal of where we stand within
world soccer.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface and this, perhaps, is where Sampson focused the
Americans didn't do as badly as it seemed. They threw a small scare
at the Germans (if only Frankie Hejduk's header had found its way
past Andreas Koepke), were robbed by the post against Iran, and
might have gone 0-0 with Yugoslavia if not for that unfortunate bit
at the start. No matter that they appeared unable to penetrate the
opposing defenses, that their attack stalled in the final third of
the field, or that Claudio Reyna wasn't ready for the
responsibility hoisted upon his shoulders, had the ball bounced
just a little bit differently, the Yanks might have been playing
for a chance to lose to Holland in the second round when they took
on the Yugoslavs on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, that's just a fantasy. The Americans were far weaker
than the Germans and Yugoslavs no surprise, and no disgrace and
they weren't as good as Iran, either. We had no one with the skills
of Khodadad Azizi; Reyna was no Karim Bagheri; Hejduk probably the
best U.S. player in the Cup was no match for Mehdi Mahdavikia; and
our tactics, while assuring us most of the possession and plenty of
chances, weren't as well-crafted, as successful as the Iranians'
sit-back-and-counterattack mentality.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Soccer officials might publicly pretend otherwise, but they
realize we're still light years away from competing with the
Germans and the Yugoslavs and the Brazilians and the French and the
(fill in your favorite soccer power here).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to have a world championship-caliber team for
some time to come ...,'' admitted Alan Rothenberg, U.S. Soccer's
president, after the final defeat. ``We are inching forward as a
world soccer power we're not leaping forward, but we never expected
to leap forward. It's a long, hard road to get to the top. We are
committed to getting there, we are applying resources to get there,
we have a plan to get there. We've seen glimpses of it ... it's
just going to take time.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's going to take talent, some of which we are starting to
see. Eddie Pope, probably, is bound for a top European club Major
League Soccer is fielding seven-figure offers and there is
continental interest in Hejduk, Brian Maisonneuve, Brian McBride
and Cobi Jones, too. And a crop of even more promising young talent
Clint Mathis and John O'Brien and Jovan Kirovski and Leo Cullen and
Nick Garcia and Carlos Bocanegra and Ben Olsen and Jamar Beasley
could be playing key roles when the Americans head off for Japan
and South Korea, as they surely will, for the 2002 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   That team won't be good enough to win, nor good enough to
contend, either. To do that, soccer needs to attract the best U.S.
athletes, the Michael Jordans and the Ken Griffey Jrs.; at the very
least, America's top players need to head elsewhere, to Europe, to
Italy and Germany and Spain and England, like the last generation
of U.S. stars did. It's a different world over there the
competition is more fierce, the level of play far higher, than what
can be found in MLS.
</P>
<P>
   Sampson recognizes that. ``If (players) have the opportunity,
they should grasp it and take advantage of it,'' he says. ``In the
rest of the world, you live, you eat, you breathe soccer, and
that's the only way to be able to compete with the rest of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   America will never eat, breathe or live soccer. But we have a
plan nonetheless for winning the World Cup for ``competing
realistically to have a chance to win the World Cup,'' Rothenberg
prefers within 12 years. It's Project 2010, and its aim is to
locate talent and prepare it for soccer's wars. Somewhere out
there, maybe in L.A., is a 5-year-old Ronaldo. He is the future of
American soccer.
</P>
<P>
   It may soon be Sampson's job to find that child, to develop his
skills. When he is fired as U.S. coach and he will be fired, with
Bruce Arena, perhaps, or some high-profile foreigner stepping in
figure he'll take charge of Project 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Given America's aspirations, it might be a promotion.

TEXAS DEMOCRATS ELECT FIRST WOMAN TO LEAD STATE PARTY

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The state Democratic party elected its first
female chief Saturday, former Republican Molly Beth Malcolm.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm, a Republican activist until 1992, will take over for
Houston businessman Bill White, who has been state party chairman
for the past two and a half years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you for your encouragement and your dedication; thank
you for believing in me. Most of all, thank you for giving me this
incredible opportunity,'' Malcolm said during her acceptance
speech. ``Because of you, I can say today that, yes, I am proud to
be a Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm, 43, of Texarkana, has been active in the Democratic
party since 1993, and has served on the State Democratic Executive
Committee. She was endorsed by the Texas AFL-CIO after Cecile
Richards, daughter of former Gov. Ann Richards, decided not to run.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm, the president of Texas Democratic Women, made it clear
Saturday that she will endorse all the Democratic candidates _
including Garry Mauro, who has had some trouble drumming up support
among members of his own party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support the ticket from the top to bottom; we have wonderful
candidates,'' Malcolm said. ``We have people who have the right
issues running for the positions on our ballots, and I think you're
going to hear a lot about health care and education, two major
concerns for the people in this state.''
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm said she will be one of the foot soldiers spreading the
Democratic message.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to be out there talking on a daily basis, I intend
to get our message out,'' Malcolm said. ``We're the party of real
Texas family values _ not corporate family values.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite her former allegiance to the GOP, Malcolm had few
positive things to say about Republicans after her election
Saturday. The Texas GOP also has a chairwoman, Susan Weddington.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big difference in that woman who is leading that
other party,'' she said. ``This party has always supported women;
women have always been in positions of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican party, yes, they have a woman in charge, but I
think they did it as a token gesture.''

ANGELS' SUCCESS OVERSHADOWED BY DODGERS' MESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If ever a season the Anaheim Angels should be easily upstaging
the Los Angeles Dodgers, it is this zany one in which the two
franchises have reversed traditional roles.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the Angels (a) have a remodeled state-of-the-art
stadium, (b) have a robust hitting team with an emerging superstar
in Darin Erstad, (c) are winning on a consistent basis and (d) have
a manager, Terry Collins, and (e) a general manager, Bill Bavasi,
who haven't even been (f) fired.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Dodgers have become baseball's equivalent
to the Titanic, with the team and many of its employees sinking
tragically into a sea of comedic chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite the impressive record of the Angels and the
embarrassing failings of the Dodgers, one gets the unmistakable
feeling that there still is far more interest in the Dodgers in
Southern California than the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Before a game the other night between the Dodgers and Angels,
there was a most revealing scene on the Dodger Stadium field.
</P>
<P>
   As the two teams went through their fielding, batting and
calisthenics drills, you noted a swarm of reporters gathered near
the Dodgers' dugout while only one news person was encamped by the
Angels' dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Why such a disparity?
</P>
<P>
   Why so much more media attention to the Dodgers in these parts
even during a season when the Angels, clearly, are the stronger and
more entertaining team?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the stunning departures of Mike Piazza and Hideo Noma
and sackings of Fred Claire and Bill Russell are contributing
factors.
</P>
<P>
   But even had these men not not suffered such fates the Dodgers
would have commanded more press space than the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Why do the Dodgers, even when they're haplessly
floundering, even when the team has more firings than home runs and
complete games, even when the Angels are in first place in their
division, still remain a greater public fixture?
</P>
<P>
   It long has been the belief here that those sporting types who
live within the confines of Los Angeles County simply are too
provincial to warmly embrace an entity from Orange County, which
might only be a few miles away in distance but might as well be
Fresno or San Diego to those, say, in the San Fernado Valley who
never even traverse the Sepulveda Pass.
</P>
<P>
   Look what happened to the Rams when Carroll Rosenbloom moved
them 35 miles down the Santa Ana Freeway to Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Almost overnight, they became strictly an Orange County
proposition, with the Valley and West L.A. fans shedding their Ram
allegiances and eventually lending their support to the Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for such a phenomenon is the lengthy history of
success that the Dodgers have enjoyed since moving here from
Brooklyn in 1958. During this period, they have won eight pennants
and five World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have been an ill-starred franchise that still is
seeking its first American League pennant in its 38th year.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to causing their loyalists frustrations, the
Angels exceed even the Clippers, if for no other reason than
they've been bumbling around here a lot longer.
</P>
<P>
   For too many seasons, the Angels were the the laughingstocks of
their sport, enduring the agonizing disappointments and bitter
turmoil that now are cursing the Dodgers, this summer's
laughingstocks.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the Angels did have some joyful times under the ownership of
Gene Autry, even coming within a strike of finally making it to the
World Series in 1986 when their manager, Gene Mauch, alas, made a
most notorious decision.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs in the ninth inning and the Angels in front by a
run, Mauch pulled his best pitcher, Mike Witt, setting in motion a
disastrous series of events that wound up with Dave Henderson's
hitting a dramatic home run off Donnie Moore that would propel the
Boston Red Sox to a stirring comeback and shatter Gene Autry's
World Series dream.
</P>
<P>
   For most of their existence, the Angels have struggled and
gotten rid of people the caliber of Nolan Ryan, while the Dodgers
have triumphed and sent people like Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale
and Tom Lasorda to the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's the Dodgers foolishly peddling away future Hall of
Famers, but their indiscretions haven't changed anything.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels still can't emerge from the massive Dodger shadow,
even failing to stir the passions of a segment of residents in
their own backyard.
</P>
<P>
   You must understand that there are those in Orange County who
simply won't root for a team with a nickname linked inextricably to
Los Angeles, long known as the City of Angels.
</P>
<P>
   One does idly wonder why a team ensconced in Anaheim still
refers to itself as the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   I realize the Angels began life at old Wrigley Field in L.A.,
and assumed the name of the stadium's former PCL tenants.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm surprised the Angels didn't change their name when they
shifted to Anaheim in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Why would the Anaheim-based team blindly cling to its L.A. roots
when that city still pays only scant attention to it, even during a
season when the Angels are shining?

 &HT;    CLINTON HEADS TO A STATE-REGULATED CHURCH IN CHINA
 &HT;    With CHINA-RELIGION-$ADV28; CHINA-ACCOMPLISH-0628;
CHINA-HISTBOX-$ADV28.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ President Bill Clinton worshipped at a
government-regulated Protestant church Sunday, preparing talk about
the free practice of religion, in what may be the most personal
remarks he will deliver during his sweep across China.
</P>
<P>
   ``The come for one purpose, to honor God,'' said the pastor, in
opening the service at 2,300-member Chongwenmen church, not far
from the seat of state authority in the heart of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   After addressing the largest Protestant church in China's
capital, Clinton planned to talk to a group of clergy, who in China
face the prospect of being replaced if they displease the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Churchgoers sang ``Golden Break the Dawn,'' heard the scripture
and repeated the Lord's Prayer, before Clinton had his turn at the
pulpit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton already made blunt comments about China's human rights
practices on Saturday, during an exceptional televised news
conference in which he and China's President Jiang Zemin announced
their summit a success. Then they went on to engage in a polite
debate over the 1989 violent crushing of the Tiananmen Square
protests and other sensitive subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Restriction of religious freedom has loosened in some Chinese
localities, but it remains one of the practices most criticized by
human rights activists.
</P>
<P>
   The week before Clinton left on this China visit, he met with
three American religious leaders who investigated religious
practices in China, including Tibet, last winter. The report they
released upon returning said conditions had improved in some
places, but that repression still existed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Clinton) is going to reflect about what they told him,''
White House spokesman Michael McCurry said Saturday. ``He's going
to talk about the importance we attach in the United States to the
freedom to worship.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself said last week that this speech is ``most likely
to be one that I will do virtually by myself and close to the
time'' of the event.
</P>
<P>
   The summit talks Saturday produced no breakthroughs on either
trade or limits on missile sales, which had been considered the two
most important issues to be addressed, but the leaders pronounced
the summit a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talks were positive, constructive and productive,'' Jiang
said at the summit's close.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our friendship may never be perfect -- no friendship is,''
Clinton said. ``But I hope it will last forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides agreeing to stop targeting missiles at each other's
territory, the presidents agreed to tighten controls on the export
of chemicals that can be used for weapons, called for establishing
a new compliance mechanism for the biological weapons convention
and committed their countries to ending the export and
``indiscriminate use'' of anti-personnel land mines.
</P>
<P>
   They also set up a number of exchange programs and cooperative
projects on the environment, health improvements and legal
training.
</P>
<P>
   The most remarkable development was that the news conference
televised live to an estimated half-billion Chinese at the close of
the formal talks.
</P>
<P>
   It not only showed Jiang discussing the ``extensive and in-depth
exchange of views'' between the two, but Clinton relating that he
reaffirmed America's ``one-China'' policy during the summit.
</P>
<P>
   National Security Adviser Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger called it ``a
truly historic press conference'' showing for the first time ``the
leader of the United States and the leader of China discussing and
debating a range of issues, but most particularly human rights, to
a live audience across China and the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Americans disagree with the use of force at
Tiananmen Square and suggested that China release some of the
prisoners arrested ``for offenses no longer on the books in
China.'' He referred to the sweeping law against
counter-revolutionary activities under which thousands of Chinese
were arrested over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang reiterated the Chinese stand that the aim of maintaining
order and stability was paramount.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the arrests of dissidents just prior to Clinton's
arrival -- acts that drew critical comments from Clinton and other
White House officials -- Jiang said an investigation ``shows that
there was never such a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The American side deemed that very response ``unacceptable'' on
Friday, but by Saturday was trying to paint the summit in a golden
glow, so simply ignored the fact that Chinese authorities still
appeared to be stonewalling the question.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese president also himself raised the charges in America
that the Chinese government had made illegal campaign contributions
to the Democratic National Committee, calling them ``absurd and
ridiculous'' and ``sheer fabrications.''
</P>
<P>
   ``China can never do such a thing,'' he said, ``and China never
interferes in other country's internal affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides being televised live, excerpts of the news conference
were shown on the main Chinese evening news show, which was mostly
devoted to the Clinton visit. The excerpts, however, did not
include the sensitive comments on human rights.
</P>
<P>
   The extensive state news coverage began with China's formal
welcoming of Clinton at the Great Hall of the People on the western
edge of Tiananmen Square, a ceremony some American members of
Congress had urged Clinton to skip. There followed a biographical
sketch of Clinton, then the news show ran through highlights of the
day. It even included interviews in the United States with
political and academic figures.
</P>
<P>
   A late-breaking addition to the news was a report on the state
banquet Jiang held for the Clintons in the cavernous hall that can
hold 5,000 diners.
</P>
<P>
   In one unexplained incident, a bus of journalists leaving the
dinner was suddenly stopped by a woman who had lain down in the
road. She appeared to be holding a piece of paper that she extended
up in the direction of the bus.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists on the bus said a man appeared next to her, and
immediately two green-shirted policemen roughly grabbed the pair
and dragged them out of the road and onto the sidewalk. The bus
driver refused requests to stop so the journalists could find out
what was happening.

   Me and some fellers was sitting around the campfire the other
nite, chawing tabacci and waiting for Cookie to commence ranging
the dinner bell soes we could head over to the chuck wagon for a
plate of beans, when Buck (or was it Duke?) says, ``Is any of you
boys riled?''
</P>
<P>
   We all looked at him, puzzled-like.
</P>
<P>
   Soes he says, ``Honest, I ain't a-foolin'. I was reading this
here newspaper out of Boston, that has a article in it by a feller
name of David Nyhan, and he says weez supposed to be riled.''
</P>
<P>
   Riled over what? I was fixin' to ask, least ways 'til I sinks my
spurs into a more imporant question.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you doin' lookin' at a paper from Boston?'' I asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, beggin' yer pardon,'' says Buck (or was it Duke?), ``but
all of us ain't ignernt. Some of us figure we can learn a thang or
two from peoples living in furren countries, like Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   Out here in Arizona, when a feller gets to expressin' hisself in
such a fashion, showing signs of book learnin' and other
highfalutin notions, it gits the rest of us excited. &QL; 
`We cud be smart' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Me and the boys started won derin' outloud if maybe we should
commence to readin'. Maybe stu dyin' up on what fellers from Boston
have to say. Maybe even learnin' a furren language that ain't
American, like what they talk in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cud be smart,'' I says.
</P>
<P>
   ``And cultured,'' says another.
</P>
<P>
   I tell ya, it was a rite nice momemt.
</P>
<P>
   Then we come to our senses and hauled ole Buck to the nearest
tree and hung 'im.
</P>
<P>
   Or was it Duke?
</P>
<P>
   I don't reckon it matters much no more. We did look at that
paper outta Boston, though. That feller Nyhan wrote up an article
supposed to be about Arizona's U.S. Senator John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The write-up is about how the tabacci companies is taking off
after the senator in uncomplimentary ways, ``riling the ranchers
and rodeo hands of Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   Ranchers and rodeo hands?
</P>
<P>
   Yeeeeee-hah! Ain't that just like an Easterner?
</P>
<P>
   I 'member a few months back, when the mayor of New York come to
town. A reporter from back East wrote how the mayor ``arrived in
the land of cactus flowers and six-shooters.''
</P>
<P>
   And they say WE is ignernt? &QL; 
GUN-TOTIN' MANIACS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Every time one of them Eastern dandies does a report on us, they
make it out like we is all ``ranchers and rodeo hands.''
</P>
<P>
   And a course, we ain't.
</P>
<P>
   We's also rustlers and gunsling ers, desperadoes and cutthroats,
thieves, cattle rustlers, and all perti nent forms of toothless,
gun-totin' maniacs.
</P>
<P>
   They's even a Democrat or two, though they's as jittery as
prairie dogs and just as likely to stay in they holes.
</P>
<P>
   We got rattlers, scorpions, black widder spiders and more vermin
and varmints than all the East combined, providin' you leave out
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   And, still, settlers keeps a comin'.
</P>
<P>
   We changed the state motto to ``It's too durn hot!''
</P>
<P>
   Still, new peoples arrive. Home steaders. Bringin' with them
houses and cars and green grass. Puttin' in cement ponds. Buildin'
schools and picture shows and ballparks.
</P>
<P>
   It's a regular stampede.
</P>
<P>
   Ain't no use trying to cut 'em off at the pass, neither. I hear
tell they's machines now called air-o-planes that carry folks right
over top.
</P>
<P>
   Dang.
</P>
<P>
   What's a cowpoke to do? No matter how much we say, ``Can't all
you little dogies just git along?'' they don't listen.
</P>
<P>
   Our only chance may be to call in the law. 'Round here, that'd
be Joe Arpaio, who calls hisself the ``toughest sheriff in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   He'd be one Arizona lawman who knows how to track down outside
agitators like this Nyhan feller from Boston. See, turns out Joe
was born in a town name a Springfield. In the country of
Massachusetts. &QL;

LASORDA COVETS HIS METS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The New York Mets are in a pennant race. The
Dodgers are in denial.
</P>
<P>
   New general manager Tom Lasorda was working his old shtick in
his first week on the job, even though the Dodgers dropped 13{
games behind San Diego. And through several well-placed hints,
suddenly Mike Piazza was coming back to L.A. next year and bringing
Mets manager Bobby Valentine along.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Mets are in a heated wild-card race. They dropped
the first two games of a weekend series with the cross-town
Yankees, but Shea Stadium is hopping for the first time since the
Darryl Strawberry era.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Piazza and Valentine aren't coming here next year.
Piazza's seven-year, $105 million contract demand was too much for
Fox (not just Fred Claire and Peter O'Malley). Why would it be
better with Piazza a year older and probably another year without a
championship?
</P>
<P>
   Adding the Dodgers to the free-agent shopping list is great
leverage for Piazza and his agent Dan Lozano, but Mets owner Nelson
Doubleday has seen his ballpark empty for too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Mike, we are going to get that thing done one way or
another,'' Doubleday said this past week. ``We are definitely going
to get that done.''
</P>
<P>
   Technically, Valentine can't get out of his three-year,
$2.1-million contract that has two years to run after this season.
He has a way of grading on management and players, the way he did
in Texas, but he is not at that point yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby Valentine is our manager and he will remain our
manager,'' Doubleday said. ``Sure, he is a protege of Tommy
Lasorda. But Bobby Valentine is our manager, and he is a hell of a
manager. We would resist anyone coming after him, hard, strong and
heavily.''
</P>
<P>
   Since joining the Mets, Valentine has made attempts to forge a
non-Lasorda identity. But the two have known each other for 30
years, and Valentine was a close friend of Lasorda's late son, Tom
Jr. Valentine played in Los Angeles and is married to the daughter
of former Brooklyn Dodgers right-hander Ralph Branca.
</P>
<P>
   Three times, Valentine has come close to working on a
major-league staff with Lasorda. Shortly after Lasorda retired as
Dodgers manager in 1996, Valentine considered bringing him to the
Mets as a coach. In 1982, Valentine would have become Lasorda's
third-base coach, but the Mets didn't allow him to leave the
organization. George Bamberger, then the Mets' manager, took him as
a major-league coach, instead.
</P>
<P>
   The most intriguing possibility, though, came in 1992, during
the Dodgers 99-loss season.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine was set to join Lasorda in Tampa Bay. Vince Naimoli,
the current Devil Rays owner, and Vince Piazza, Mike's father, had
reached a tentative agreement to buy the Giants and move them to
Tampa Bay for the 1993 season.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda, unsure that the Dodgers were going to retain him after
the last-place showing, agreed to take the job as Tampa Bay manager
for one year before being promoted to GM. His third-base coach that
first year was going to be Valentine, who would then take over as
manager the next season. His pitching coach was going to be Charlie
Hough, who took the Dodgers job Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But baseball owners would not approve Piazza as an owner, and
the Giants never moved. Lasorda was given a new contract by
O'Malley.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, when Lasorda was inducted into the Hall of Fame, he
was asked which manager he would hire if he were a GM.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would take Bobby Valentine,'' Lasorda said. ``I think he's
an outstanding manager. I've seen what he's done with that Mets
team. The guy's taken a team that no one even thought had a chance
and he's about 14 or 15 games over .500. I think that's quite a
remarkable job.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda already had alienated long-time friend Bill Russell,
Dodgers manager until last Sunday. But O'Malley also was incensed.
He chewed Lasorda out just a day before Lasorda's number was
retired in ceremonies at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   People close to Mike Piazza say he is intrigued by the
possibility of returning to the Dodgers _ much the way Kenny Lofton
returned to Cleveland one year after he was traded by the Indians.
One of Piazza's confidants said recently the catcher is now
considering signing a long-term contract with either the Mets,
Yankees, Dodgers or Orioles. He would give the Mets the first
chance if he thought they would maintain a strong team around him.
</P>
<P>
   For Piazza, one of the pluses of playing with the Mets is he
does not have to be a leader. Closer John Franco likes that job,
although he is eligible for free agency. The Dodgers forced the
leadership role on Piazza simply because he was their best player.
It was a bad fit.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza also has been given assurances that he will be catcher
when incumbent Todd Hundley returns from reconstructive elbow
surgery next month. Hundley was given a no-trade clause to assure
him that he will have time to make the transition to left field
without pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only concern is helping the Mets win, and hopefully,
getting them into the playoffs,'' Piazza said. ``I can't answer
about the past. I can't answer about the future. I'm dealing with
the present.''
</P>
<P>
   ABBOTT'S RETURN?
</P>
<P>
   Jim Abbott, who returned to baseball this season with the
Chicago White Sox after retiring from the Angels two years ago, was
promoted this past week to Double-A Birmingham after five starts at
Single A.
</P>
<P>
   In his last start at Winston-Salem, Abbott gave up one hit and
no runs in six innings. This is the same pitcher who had a
significant drop in velocity on his fastball in his final year with
the Angels, but there is some hope that he could be ready to make a
big-league comeback after the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting more and more comfortable every time out,''' said
Abbott, who lost 18 games for the Angels in 1996. ``I knew coming
down here, it was going to take some work. I feel like I've got my
feet back underneath me.''
</P>
<P>
   White Sox instructor Jerry Terrell was at the game in
Winston-Salem and was impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a chance to scout him in the big leagues, and that was
vintage Abbott tonight,'' Terrell said. ``Not only was he in
command of his pitches, but he fielded his position.''
</P>
<P>
   GABE RUTH
</P>
<P>
   Tigers rookie third baseman Gabe Alvarez homered twice Tuesday
in Detroit's victory against St. Louis, one day after getting a
single in his first major-league at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez, 24, was acquired from Arizona in November in an
expansion deal for Travis Fryman. He was tied for the lead among
all minor-league players with 20 home runs. In addition, he had 58
RBI and was batting .273 at Triple-A Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so excited about this I didn't sleep at all last night,''
said the former USC player after his first game. ``I couldn't. So I
watched cartoons, then caught a flight here.''
</P>
<P>
   After his first hit, Alvarez got a little advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll always remember Mark McGwire saying when I got to first
base, `See, all you have to do is work the count to 3-1 and you get
a nice fastball,''' said Alvarez, who was surprised McGwire even
spoke to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nervous, and I think he knew I was nervous,'' Alvarez
said. ``He loosened things up a little''
</P>
<P>
   GOING DOWN
</P>
<P>
   Josh Booty, the first pick of the 1994 draft, began this season
as Florida's starting third baseman in place of the injured Bobby
Bonilla. But last Sunday he was hitting only .142 with 44
strikeouts and just seven walks in 37 games for Triple-A Charlotte
before the Marlins demoted him to Double-A.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a point where you've got to put up numbers, and it
wasn't getting done for Josh in Triple-A,'' said John Boles, the
Marlins' vice president of player development. ``There's no way to
sugar-coat it.''
</P>
<P>
   Booty is a career .198 hitter in the minor leagues and has yet
to make the adjustments he needs to make to become a major-league
hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Josh has to continue working on hitting the breaking ball and
the change-up, and he wasn't having success with it in Charlotte,''
Boles said. ``You want the guy to build on some positive things,
and he didn't have too many positives going for him in Triple-A.''
</P>
<P>
   WONDER DOG GROUNDED
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a surprise Wednesday when the Phillies released former
Angel Rex Hudler and his .122 average.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hudler's release was like no other in the history of
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   First, he performed his own interview on the all-sports
television station that carries Phillies games. Then, he broke down
in tears talking about what a pleasure it was to hear fans thank
him for signing autographs along the first-base line.
</P>
<P>
   He also thanked the Phillies for all they had done for him.
Then, after saying his good-byes to teammates, Hudler, 37, walked
across the Phillies' clubhouse and hugged Jon Zuber, the man who
had just taken his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more than a stats player,'' said Hudler, whose
ultra-positive clubhouse influence got him the nickname Wonder Dog.
``I'm not the same player I was when I was 25, 26, 27 years old,
but I still have some physical skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, no one saw them this year. The Phillies signed him to a
two-year, $2.6-million deal before last season, and he contributed
12 RBI. In 1996, Hudler hit .311 with 16 homers and 40 RBI for the
Angels. &QL;

KKK, BLACK PANTHERS TRADE INSULTS IN JASPER
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
.MDNM/ JASPER, Texas _ Members of the Ku Klux Klan and the New
Black Panthers postured and exchanged bellicose words Saturday in
this tense East Texas community, but the confrontations were minor
and only two people were arrested.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only 16 Klansmen and two Klanswomen showed up in robes and
hoods, despite two weeks of media coverage before the rally. The
white-supremacist group called the gathering to dissociate itself
from the June 7 torture-slaying of a disabled black Jasper man by
three whites.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 New Black Panthers, marching a few blocks away with
rifles and shotguns, were not permitted to come near the Klan rally
on the courthouse square. Several of their leaders tried to rush a
cordon of state troopers in riot gear who surrounded the Klansmen,
but they were pushed back each time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It only takes one,'' Darrell Flinn of the Vidor-based Knights
of the White Kamellia replied when asked why the Klan turnout was
so poor, despite his assertion that Jasper is in the middle of
``Klan country.''
</P>
<P>
   The 90-minute Klan rally began, curiously, with a recorded black
Gospel rendition of the ``Battle Hymn of the Republic,'' theme of
the Union forces in the Civil War. ``It's on the tape,'' explained
a chagrined grand dragon, Michael D. Lowe of Waco.
</P>
<P>
   All Klan speakers decried the slaying of James R. Byrd Jr.,
which they called ``unnecessary.'' They said the killing was
wrongly blamed on white supremacists because two of the three men
arrested had joined the Aryan Nation in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Three white men _ Shawn Berry and John William King, both 23,
and Lawrence Russell Brewer Jr., 31 _ are charged with Byrd's
slaying. All three have prison records and authorities have said at
least two have tattoos associated with white racist prison gangs.
Racist literature was seized from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The Klan accused the ``liberal'' media of playing down the
killing of a local white man, Jerry McQueen, by a black man a week
before Byrd's murder. Flinn called it a hate crime; authorities
said the assailant fatally beat McQueen during a robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Stores and banks within several blocks of the courthouse square
closed down at the city's request.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper's black mayor, R.C. Horn, said all but a few dozen local
residents heeded his advice to stay clear of the area, where 200
Texas Rangers, state troopers, game wardens, local police and
sheriff's deputies provided tight security. Many chose to follow
the afternoon's events at home through folksy, live reports by Mike
Lout, owner of Jasper's only rock 'n' roll station, KJAS-FM.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, in San Antonio to speak at the
Democratic State Convention, said he is not going to Jasper this
weekend and urged others to stay away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Klan is there marching to recruit,'' said Jackson, a civil
rights leader and former presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're there to put salt in the wounds. They're there to
convince whites that the three whites who killed Mr. Byrd were
protecting them against black people. Such pathological sickness
should not attract a crowd. They need an audience. The people in
Jasper ought to go fishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the presence of the New Black Panthers, Jackson said
it is ``the job of government to protect people from terrorism or
threats of terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We should put the burden upon the government, not upon some
well-meaning citizens who themselves could get drawn into something
they would regret the next day,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 60 or so anti-Klan demonstrators _ dwarfed by a far
larger contingent of journalists from around the United States,
Asia and Europe _ came from out of town. They included a Euless
punk-style group called Anti-Racist Action. The two people who were
arrested _ one black and one white, both opposed to the Klan _ were
accused of disorderly conduct.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen Klan supporters showed up, also from elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Saturdays normally are quiet in Jasper. The day is devoted to
house-cleaning, lawn-mowing and perhaps a run to nearby Lake Sam
Rayburn. But this Saturday, it was markedly anxious and quiet
beyond the 109-year-old courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   A flag-football league game was canceled because of the rally,
as was a reunion of the McQueen family. Local motels reported
cancellations by regular clients, the pristine Shady Creek Park was
empty, and business was off at the Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   The rally and blockaded streets, however, did not ruin the
happiest day in the young life of kindergarten teacher Stacy Lyn
Rhames, who married a local undertaker an hour after the tumult
ended just two blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody feels sorry I had to put up with all this,'' she
said before the nuptials.
</P>
<P>
   An uncle from San Antonio cited the Klan action when he
telephoned to say he would not be coming, and Rhames feared others
would not chance driving to the First United Methodist Church for
the wedding and reception.
</P>
<P>
   But a large crowd of family and well-wishers turned up. The
bridesmaids wore watermelon red; the bride was radiant when she
tossed her bouquet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We totally ignored it all,'' Rhames _ now Mrs. Shultz _ said
of the commotion that was a short walk away. ``I'm happy.''
</P>
<P>
   On a farm-to-market road just a few miles from where James
Byrd's dismembered body was found, the black Twine family didn't
allow the Klan to interfere with its annual reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Children played tug-of-war, and their parents _ 12 grown sons
and daughters jnVn; ssorted spousest6Kav3ht up on family news while
a mammoth smoker transformed beef brisket and chicken into East
Texas barbecue. Some relatives came from as far away as New York.
</P>
<P>
   One daughter, Virginia Twine of Houston, said a friend had urged
her not to travel to Jasper this weekend because of the Klan rally.
She recalled replying, ``I was born and raised in Jasper, Ann. It
isn't like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Just what Jasper is like is not always easy to answer.
</P>
<P>
   Some black residents noted that the town lacks a municipal
swimming pool because it would have to be integrated and that Byrd
was buried in the traditionally black section of the city cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   None could cite a major racial incident before Byrd's killing.
</P>
<P>
   Judy James, a white Jasper schoolteacher, said she had taken for
granted the number of blacks in key positions until the community
of 7,800 _ 45 percent black _ came under media scrutiny. Aside from
the mayor and two of Axd eve City Council members, two school
principals and the Chamber of Commerce president are black. Until
recently, a respected black timber company executive served as the
school board president.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, George Miller, administrator of the town's largest
hospital, who emerged as a unifying figure after the slaying, noted
that he was selected for his job by nine white board members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the Klan and the Black Panthers, there is now no focal
point, so things might finally calm down here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the local Wal-Mart, Stacey Moore, a white Jasper native, said
she is ``proud of Jasper'' and ``how we've responded to all this,''
as she paid for her milk, eggs, Coke and other groceries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The KKK and the Black Panthers, all they're doing is stirring
up trouble. And I'm not going to let them affect my routine. We
want peace and time to let the (Byrd) family heal.''

</P>
<P>
   Stores and banks within several blocks of the courthouse square
closed down at the city's request.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper's black mayor, R.C. Horn, said all but a few dozen local
residents heeded his advice to stay clear of the area, where 200
Texas Rangers, state troopers, game wardens, local police and
sheriff's deputies provided tight security. Many chose to follow
the afternoon's events at home through folksy, live reports by Mike
Lout, owner of Jasper's only rock 'n' roll station, KJAS-FM.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, in San Antonio to speak at the
Democratic State Convention, said he is not going to Jasper this
weekend and urged others to stay away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Klan is there marching to recruit,'' said Jackson, a civil
rights leader and former presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're there to put salt in the wounds. They're there to
convince whites that the three whites who killed Mr. Byrd were
protecting them against black people. Such pathological sickness
should not attract a crowd. They need an audience. The people in
Jasper ought to go fishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the presence of the New Black Panthers, Jackson said
it is ``the job of government to protect people from terrorism or
threats of terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We should put the burden upon the government, not upon some
well-meaning citizens who themselves could get drawn into something
they would regret the next day,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 60 or so anti-Klan demonstrators _ dwarfed by a far
larger contingent of journalists from around the United States,
Asia and Europe _ came from out of town. They included a Euless
punk-style group called Anti-Racist Action. The two people who were
arrested _ one black and one white, both opposed to the Klan _ were
accused of disorderly conduct.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen Klan supporters showed up, also from elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Saturdays normally are quiet in Jasper. The day is devoted to
house-cleaning, lawn-mowing and perhaps a run to nearby Lake Sam
Rayburn. But this Saturday, it was markedly anxious and quiet
beyond the 109-year-old courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   A flag-football league game was canceled because of the rally,
as was a reunion of the McQueen family. Local motels reported
cancellations by regular clients, the pristine Shady Creek Park was
empty, and business was off at the Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   The rally and blockaded streets, however, did not ruin the
happiest day in the young life of kindergarten teacher Stacy Lyn
Rhames, who married a local undertaker an hour after the tumult
ended just two blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody feels sorry I had to put up with all this,'' she
said before the nuptials.
</P>
<P>
   An uncle from San Antonio cited the Klan action when he
telephoned to say he would not be coming, and Rhames feared others
would not chance driving to the First United Methodist Church for
the wedding and reception.
</P>
<P>
   But a large crowd of family and well-wishers turned up. The
bridesmaids wore watermelon red; the bride was radiant when she
tossed her bouquet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We totally ignored it all,'' Rhames _ now Mrs. Shultz _ said
of the commotion that was a short walk away. ``I'm happy.''
</P>
<P>
   On a farm-to-market road just a few miles from where James
Byrd's dismembered body was found, the black Twine family didn't
allow the Klan to interfere with its annual reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Children played tug-of-war, and their parents _ 12 grown sons
and daughters and assorted spouses _ caught up on family news while
a mammoth smoker transformed beef brisket and chicken into East
Texas barbecue. Some relatives came from as far away as New York.
</P>
<P>
   One daughter, Virginia Twine of Houston, said a friend had urged
her not to travel to Jasper this weekend because of the Klan rally.
She recalled replying, ``I was born and raised in Jasper, Ann. It
isn't like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Just what Jasper is like is not always easy to answer.
</P>
<P>
   Some black residents noted that the town lacks a municipal
swimming pool because it would have to be integrated and that Byrd
was buried in the traditionally black section of the city cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   None could cite a major racial incident before Byrd's killing.
</P>
<P>
   Judy James, a white Jasper schoolteacher, said she had taken for
granted the number of blacks in key positions until the community
of 7,800 _ 45 percent black _ came under media scrutiny. Aside from
the mayor and two of the five City Council members, two school
principals and the Chamber of Commerce president are black. Until
recently, a respected black timber company executive served as the
school board president.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, George Miller, administrator of the town's largest
hospital, who emerged as a unifying figure after the slaying, noted
that he was selected for his job by nine white board members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the Klan and the Black Panthers, there is now no focal
point, so things might finally calm down here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the local Wal-Mart, Stacey Moore, a white Jasper native, said
she is ``proud of Jasper'' and ``how we've responded to all this,''
as she paid for her milk, eggs, Coke and other groceries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The KKK and the Black Panthers, all they're doing is stirring
up trouble. And I'm not going to let them affect my routine. We
want peace and time to let the (Byrd) family heal.''

LONG, HOT SUMMER FOR NBA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Images from the front lines of a labor war:
</P>
<P>
   A free agent who can't find a new team.
</P>
<P>
   A rookie who can't polish his game in summer league.
</P>
<P>
   A general manager left pondering for months how to fill out his
roster.
</P>
<P>
   A country forced to field amateurs in international competition.
</P>
<P>
   A fan forced to watch, er, hockey? Football? Curling on ESPN2?
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaires fight multimillionaires over a $1.8 billion
industry, and everyone loses.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the long summer, and possibly longer fall, to come in
the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Owners and players are at an impasse over the league's labor
contract, and on Wednesday the league is expected to impose a
lockout of players. Literally speaking, it means the owners lock
the players out of NBA facilities.
</P>
<P>
   But more significantly, it means all NBA business will come to a
halt _ no signings, no trades, no negotiating with free agents _
until a new labor contract is signed. And because the owners and
the players association are miles apart on the key economic issues,
that day could be months away.
</P>
<P>
   The fight in the interim promises to be drawn-out, ugly and,
ultimately, harmful to the league.
</P>
<P>
   The long, hot summer will affect everyone from the GMs to the
rookies and free agents and eventually, the season-ticket holder,
the scalper and the couch potato.
</P>
<P>
   A look at the potential lockout from different perspectives:
</P>
<P>
   THE LEAGUE
</P>
<P>
   If the NBA commissioner's office ever emulated its players' art
of smack talking, its crack on other league commissioners might be,
``Well, at least !ital!we've!off! never lost a single
regular-season game to a labor crisis!''
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner David Stern's best bragging point could soon go the
way of the dodo bird, Marv Albert's broadcasting career and NBA
short shorts.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the union has advised players to plan on missing their
first paychecks, due Nov. 15, implying the season opener is
considered in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom says it will take the threat of missing
games to force a compromise on the so-called ``Bird exception,''
which allows teams to spend unlimited dollars on their free agents.
The league hopes otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's huge concern that if we suffer a work stoppage where
we miss games there will be a great deal of damage,'' NBA deputy
commissioner Russ Granik said. ``But that's not a reason to operate
an unprofitable business. You can't use that (concern) as a basis
for continuing a system that doesn't work. I'd be kidding to try to
say we didn't have serious concern about the results.''
</P>
<P>
   Granik and Stern need only look to Major League Baseball's 1994
strike as the perfect example of how to nearly cripple a league
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Major league baseball lost a reported $185 million in 1996, the
first full season year after the 94 strike that killed the World
Series for the first time in history. Baseball teams overall lost
$875 million in the three-year span.
</P>
<P>
   It's only in the last year or so that baseball has seen a
recovery and an upswing in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 93 baseball had a record year as far as attendance ... and
'94 was heading that way until the strike and the cancellation of
the World Series,'' said Katy Feeney, National League senior vice
president. ``It hurt baseball. It's not how you want to do
business.''
</P>
<P>
   THE GENERAL MANAGER
</P>
<P>
   Even the threat of the lockout _ it's been anticipated for
months, and neither side figured it would be avoidable _ has
impacted teams.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks leading up to July 1, general managers are
typically in a Monty Hall mentality, dealing their underachievers
for the promise of someone else's spare parts. But the lockout put
a chill on all but a handful of potential deals.
</P>
<P>
   GMs need the flexibility of renouncing rights to their free
agents _ a process that would normally take place in July _ to
clear salary cap room. And then there's the uncertainty over how a
new collective bargaining agreement might change the rules for
re-signing free agents or increase the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, there's a lot more (trade) talk'' than in a
typical June, Lakers GM Mitch Kupchak said two weeks ago, ``but in
my opinion, you won't see as much happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, not much has, with the Lakers' Nick Van Exel trade among
the handful of exceptions. Most trades so far involved rookies in
last week's draft.
</P>
<P>
   The big loser among GMs could be Phoenix's Bryan Colangelo. The
Suns have only three players under contract and if the lockout
stretches into the fall, Colangelo might have as little as two
weeks to put together the other 75 percent of the roster.
</P>
<P>
   THE FREE AGENT
</P>
<P>
   Rick Fox passed up millions of dollars to join the Lakers for a
one-year, $1 million contract and the shot at a championship. His
reward is a fuzzy future.
</P>
<P>
   Fox will be a free agent Wednesday and wants to return to the
Lakers. The team again can't afford his market value due to
salary-cap constraints. But a new labor deal might make Fox a Laker
again.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, a half-dozen other teams _ among them
Cleveland, Atlanta, Vancouver, Houston and Orlando _ would like to
offer him a multiyear deal. Two European teams covet him as well
and are willing to pay close to NBA-type money.
</P>
<P>
   But the seven-year pro is caught in a Fox-trap. Under NBA rules,
teams and players can't talk until July 1. And under a lockout,
they can't talk at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard being patient and just waiting, without knowing even
what date he'll be able to sign a contract,'' said Mark Portnoy,
Fox's agent. ``On the other hand, Rick is confident of what he's
done in the past that he'll be able to get his market value. But it
is hard emotionally.''
</P>
<P>
   THE ROOKIE
</P>
<P>
   The NBA sponsors pro summer leagues each offseason in order to
get rookies into playing shape and to give young free agent
hopefuls a shot at an NBA contract. It was in the 1997 summer
league that little-known center Keith Closs got the attention of
NBA scouts and snagged a $9 million, five-year contract with the
Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   But there will be no summer leagues, and that's a setback for
the rookies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just so much to learn and so much to do, especially
with the lockout it's going to be tough,'' said Sam Jacobson,
drafted by the Lakers out of Minnesota last week.
</P>
<P>
   THE FAN
</P>
<P>
   Last, definitely not least. But before the fan embarks on a
summer of self-pity, take heart in this much: The fans eventually
have something to gain from the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   In all likelihood, the new labor agreement will tighten the
salary-cap exceptions that have allowed teams to spend freely on
marquee players at the expense of letting other players go.
</P>
<P>
   Under different rules, the Bulls might have paid less to Michael
Jordan and hung onto free-agent center Brian Williams. Under
different rules, the Lakers might have been able to keep Travis
Knight, who they developed as a rookie but immediately lost to free
agency.
</P>
<P>
   And the new labor pact will almost certainly mandate longer
rookie contracts, up to four or five years instead of the current
three years. So the Denver Nuggets wouldn't have had to trade away
Antonio McDyess, fearing the choice of perhaps overpaying an
unproven talent or risking losing him to another team with money to
spend.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the fans might see a little less roster turnover
and a more recognizable home team.
</P>
<P>
   So sit back, relax, and wait. Take up a hobby. Because there
will be a lockout, and it will almost certainly be protracted,
painful and boring.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a lockout unless a miracle takes place,'' said
players association executive Billy Hunter, ``which probably won't
happen. We're probably in for a long summer.''

NAACP'S ANGRY VOICE IN ARIZONA: `I'M NOT HERE FOR PEOPLE TO LIKE
ME' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIE AMPARANO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oscar Tillman has a file folder full of death threats.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't worry about the ones that come to his office, which
he stashes and locks in a cabinet. It's the ones that find their
way to his home that disturb him.
</P>
<P>
   Those, he complains, violate a sacred division between his
kick-down-the-door, in-your-face public persona and a gentle
private life devoted to his three children, gourmet cooking and his
wife of 32 years, Sheila.
</P>
<P>
   Tillman is the state's NAACP president and a part-time minister.
He talks like a drill sergeant and has made the Valley his boot
camp. That hasn't made him popular with many of Arizona's White
forces _ or even the ranks of the city's Blacks and other
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not here for people to like me,'' says Tillman, who turned
54 in May. ``My job is to call it like it is. To wake people up.
Lots of people don't like that.''
</P>
<P>
   For some, Tillman is a voice in the wilderness in a city where
public dissent is uncommon and where minority communities often
lack effective leadership. Others think he's a disagreeable,
caustic rabble-rouser who usually gets his facts wrong. But all
agree that his outbursts have riled liberals, conser vatives,
people of all classes and even some of his closest backers.
</P>
<P>
   Just this month, Tillman angered law-enforcement officials when
he blasted the Phoenix Police Depart ment for arresting a Black
teenager in the fatal shooting of two Apollo High School students,
but letting two White men go. When it turned out the accused
killer's companions were a Black male and a White female, Tillman
acknowledged he made a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   In April, he angered many Black supporters when he condemned the
appointment of Phoenix's first Black police chief, Harold Hurtt,
for not being an outsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why'd he have to do that?'' asks one prominent Black leader.
``He just can't keep his mouth shut.''
</P>
<P>
   And at former Gov. Fife Syming ton's lowest moment, when he was
convicted of fraud in U.S. District Court last September, Tillman
couldn't resist giving one last jab to the chief executive who
never granted him a face-to-face audience: ``You can cancel my
request to meet with the governor,'' Tillman told a Symington staff
member minutes after the governor was convicted. &QL; 
WORKS FOR NO PAY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For his job with the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, Tillman gets paid nothing _ not even money for gas.
Nor does he get paid for his work as assistant pastor at the New
Home Baptist Church in southwest Phoe nix.
</P>
<P>
   He is retired from the Air Force, and a military pension helps
him pay the bills. Many past NAACP presidents in Arizona have held
full-time jobs. Tillman says this keeps him from running into any
conflicts of interest with an em ployer.
</P>
<P>
   But some people say conflict is what Tillman is all about.
Privately he is soft-spoken and thoughtful, but much of the public
knows him only as an angry sound bite.
</P>
<P>
   At the Coffee Plantation in the Biltmore, several White
customers describe Tillman as inflammatory and racially divisive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tune him out because he seems so out there,'' says
Marlene Thomas of Phoenix. ``He makes outrageous accusations. I
feel like he isn't willing to work things out. The first thing he
does is call for boycotts.''
</P>
<P>
   Others criticize Tillman for jump ing the gun before getting all
the facts.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hamblin, a radio talk-show host in Denver, cites two
shoplifting cases _ one in Phoenix and one in Denver, when Tillman
was the head of the NAACP there. In both cases, Tillman rallied the
Black commu nity and accused the stores of racism, civil rights
violations and using excessive force. In the Phoe nix case, he even
called for an FBI investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But after all the drama, both women were found guilty of shop
lifting. One was even caught on videotape. &QL; 
`HE NEVER HESITATES' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   However, some contend Tillman is one of the few leaders in
Phoenix who will speak his mind and stand up for minorities'
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of anyone else who is willing to take the
stances he has,'' says Stephen Montoya, a civil rights attorney in
Phoenix. ``He never hesitates to come out for what is right.''
</P>
<P>
   In December, he threatened to boycott Scottsdale's popular
Phoenix Open when city officials failed to take harsh action
against the Scotts dale Police Department over allega tions it used
racial slurs and referred to a wealthy area as a ``no nigger
zone.'' Earlier this year, he was the only minority leader
badgering leg islators to pass a bill preserving the attorney
general's authority to en force civil rights laws.
</P>
<P>
   Tillman is seen as a savior to residents of the Valley's
poorest, predominantly Black neighbor hoods, where his no-nonsense
talk appeals to their sense of frustration and injustice. These
residents say his tactics are more necessary than ever as the gap
widens between the Valley's poorest and wealthiest resi dents.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Smith says Tillman helped him settle a discrimination
and harassment case against his em ployer. Smith says he was being
harassed on the job because he asked why he had been bypassed for
a &UR; promotion for someone who had less seniority and an inferior work
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next thing you know, the guy they had promoted was giving me
a &UR; hard time at work. He was writing me up for things I didn't
even &UR; do. Then he tried to put me on a night shift,'' recalls Smith,
who works for a high-tech manufacturer in Chan dler. ``That's when
I took the matter to the NAACP and Tillman.''
</P>
<P>
   Tillman was swift.
</P>
<P>
   ``He created such an uproar that people were backing up like
crazy,'' recalls Smith, who says they were preparing a lawsuit
against the company. ``They're so afraid to deal with him again
that they don't dare try to pull any &UR; more shenanigans with me.'' &QL; 
PAYS PRICE IN HEALTH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For his efforts, Tillman has paid a price, says his wife,
Sheila. In the summer of 1995, he suffered a mild heart attack. His
health &UR; is fine now. But his wife makes certain he relaxes at home
and &UR; leaves his work at the office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always believed that the price of freedom is absolute
vigi lance. Oscar is a great watchman. But there is a tremendous
toll on his health,'' she says. ``I worried about that and I worry
about the death threats. But Arizona needs him.''
</P>
<P>
   Tillman spends most days at NAACP offices in south Phoenix,
hearing complaints and calling em ployers and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   For all of his railing in public, it is in the office where he
earns his credibility. He spends day after day on the phone,
arguing, cajoling, shouting and listening to people who feel
they've been wronged.
</P>
<P>
   On this afternoon, he is talking up a tirade on the phone with a
human resources director and stat ing the case for a worker
claiming job discrimination. Sitting in his small office, he has
his eyebrows raised and is listening intently.
</P>
<P>
   ``You purposely put him in this environment!'' shouts Tillman,
threatening to sue the company. ``How do you expect someone to
succeed in this condition?''
</P>
<P>
   He lets the other person speak, then erupts: ``Now, you listen
here! This isn't right! I'm not going away until I have some
answers. You can't do this to a person. You better have some
answers next time I call!''
</P>
<P>
   Tillman hangs up. He stares at the phone, takes a deep breath
and begins to tackle other files on his desk when the phone rings.
This time a woman is calling to complain the NAACP isn't doing
enough on her discrimination case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait a minute!'' Tillman yells. ``You never came in here and
filled out that paperwork, did you? Did you get your documentation
ready? Well, don't come complaining to me that we haven't done
anything on your case. We can't do anything if you haven't done a
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He rubs his temples. Sometimes, the job gives him a headache, he
explains.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; So why does he do it?
</P>
<P>
   Some say it's the attention. Or the power. Still others find the
answer in his childhood. Tillman's life is full of painful memories
of racial prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   Born on May 7, 1944, Tillman grew up in Wadesboro, N.C., &UR; where
his family worked picking crops _ cotton, watermelon, apples, what
ever was in season.
</P>
<P>
   He rattles off the memories: the tired, old Black workers who
were required to give up their seats on buses for White passengers.
Ku Klux Klan rallies. Opportunities his parents were denied. His
first job at a local cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   There he was paid only in tips. Once, a party of 27 adults and
children laughed as they left a penny at each of their plates for
his gratuity.
</P>
<P>
   Such humiliations left a lasting impression _ and later
motivated him to speak out against racial injustices.
</P>
<P>
   Tired of the small-town mentality, Tillman joined the military.
Various military recruiters would set up booths at the local post
office. On the day Tillman went to sign up, only the Air Force was
there. He signed up on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Tillman met his wife while he was stationed at Mather Air Force
Base near Sacramento. It wasn't love at first sight. He was 18 and
she was 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought he was so arrogant and brassy,'' Sheila says.
``I really didn't want anything to do with him. I was studious and
quiet. Plus, I was raised that nice girls don't date Air Force
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The two married three years later.
</P>
<P>
   Tillman's vigilance began in 1970s, while he was receiving
training at Fort McClelland Army base in Alabama. Fed up with
military police searches of lockers without cause, Tillman
protested. He says he called the first sergeant on duty and told
him: ``It was illegal and I wouldn't be letting them go through my
locker unless I was ordered to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   The searches continued, but Till man only had a few weeks to go
before returning to his Air Force base.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the military, Tillman says, he tried to challenge
injustices whenever he came across them.
</P>
<P>
   JOINED NAACP IN 1980S &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His work with NAACP began in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, he decided to run for the president's seat of the
Tacoma, Wash., NAACP. He won and spent four years there. Then his
wife was transferred to Arizona by her em ployer, US West.
</P>
<P>
   When he came to Phoenix at the end of 1987, Tillman took over
the &UR; local chapter of the NAACP for Maricopa County. Then in 1992,
Tillman moved to Denver. His wife had received a transfer and he
joined the NAACP there.
</P>
<P>
   For many, it was time to cele brate. Throughout the Valley, offi
cials of various races were toasting the news, saying their nemesis
was leaving town.
</P>
<P>
   Their revelry, however, was short-lived. Tillman moved back to
Phoenix after just a year.
</P>
<P>
   Denver's Black community con sidered Tillman too controversial
and never welcomed him. Tillman says the entire time he was there,
only two Black ministers invited him to visit their congregations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like the Black community there was using me and I
didn't like that,'' Tillman recalls.
</P>
<P>
   He moved back to Arizona and has been raising a ruckus ever
since. He became NAACP state president shortly in 1995 and won a
two-year, re-election bid in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Tillman's community ties also are grounded in his role as
assistant pastor for the New Home Baptist Church, located in the
drug-infested streets off Buckeye Road.
</P>
<P>
   As he enters the church's door one recent day, Tillman's caustic
demeanor changes. The anger seems to have vanished.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's touched all our lives with his dedication. Most people of
his status would go to a bigger churches,'' Maggie Holden says.
``But he chose a small church. He likes to help the kids. If the
kids make good grades, he gives them money out of his own pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   On this Sunday, about 50 people sit in the 11-pew church. An
eight-person choir belts out gospel hymns. Outside, a few yards
away from the church parking lot, a drug dealer hangs out on the
street corner.
</P>
<P>
   During the service, there is a special moment for people who
need a group prayer to come forward. Ten-year-old Ianisha Morn ing
shuffles up and takes a chair before the church. The girl, who
lives in Scottsdale, tearfully explains that kids on the playground
have been calling her ``terrible names'' and she needs help coping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something is wrong with our society,'' Tillman storms. ``In
1998, there's no reason a child should be asking us to stand up &UR; for
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Tillman also draws support from his wife and family. He and
Sheila live in a historic central Phoenix neighborhood, in a house
that has become a haven from the unsettling world of politics and
racial contro versy.
</P>
<P>
   At the home, a wall is covered with signed watercolor prints by
Seattle artist Danny Mayes. Another wall is strewn with words made
out of wood, such as ``perseverance,'' ``love,'' ``tears,''
``integrity`` and ``honesty.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheila shows off pictures of their three children _ daughter
Sharon, 30, and their two adopted sons, Mazuba, 26, and Greg, 25.
And she talks about the demands her hus band is under and the toll
of his stress.
</P>
<P>
   When the stress gets severe, Tillman retreats to his kitchen,
where he is the family's main cook.
</P>
<P>
   The support Tillman draws from family, church and low-income mi
norities is belied by his status as a political loner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a radical. No one (in the Black community) wanted to let
me in. I kept finding myself being left out of important
meetings,'' Tillman says. ``I guess you could say I was an outsider
and kind of a rebel.''
</P>
<P>
   People in power sense that he is an outsider. They try to ignore
him, refusing to invite him to the tables of discussion. Tillman,
they feel, is a flame-thrower, averse to compro mise, and no one
wants to get burned. But in a Valley that is only 3 percent Black,
he is still a force to be reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Scott Bundgaard, R-Glen dale, is among those who think
Tillman lacks control.
</P>
<P>
   He butted heads with him this year over the legislator's
proposed ban on affirmative action in Ari zona. In testimony before
a Senate committee, Tillman referred to Bundgaard and other
supporters as the type who wear ``white hoods.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You really have to wonder about the way he goes about getting
his message across. He doesn't choose his words very wisely and he
comes across as very extreme. He gets carried away by the emotion
of his debate,'' Bundgaard said. ``But when the mikes are off and
the camera is put away, he's a very nice man. So you almost have to
wonder what's motivating him.''
</P>
<P>
   Tillman does have his public allies. They include Maricopa
County Supervisor Mary Rose Wil cox and Montoya, the Phoenix civil
rights attorney. He also has drawn the media's attention because of
his willingness to speak out in anger.
</P>
<P>
   It took Lincoln Ragsdale, the funeral tycoon who died in 1996,
to give Tillman the break he needed to gain a position of influence
in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had just finished a meeting, but everyone was getting into
their cars and heading to a private meeting. He saw me walking to
my car and he came up to me and told me to get into his car,''
Tillman says.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew no one would tell him anything. They didn't like me be
cause I was the kick-the-door-down type. But I've never gotten
anything by knocking on doors. Arizona wasn't used to that. I don't
know if it still is.''

Minor-league experience a joy for Heisman favorite Williams
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JONATHAN FEIGEN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
BATAVIA, N.Y. _ From the moment the sky first opens, bringing the
sort of storm you remember, there is no doubt the game will become
a rainout. Within minutes, the perfect grass of Damaschke Field,
the longtime and traditional throwback home of the Oneonta Yankees,
is a swamp. The perfunctory examination of the lagoons in the
infield notwithstanding, there is no chance the O-Yanks and the
Batavia Muckdogs will attempt anything but a rapid run to the bus
for the next minor-league road trip.
</P>
<P>
   But long after both teams, save a few Muckdogs huddled in the
dugout, have escaped to the protection of their clubhouses, Ricky
Williams stands alone and swings a bat, hard and repeatedly. The
rain pounds down around him. But Williams was on deck when it hit,
so he keeps on swinging his bat, stopping only to shout toward a
teammate, once even offering a Singin' In the Rain dance step,
jumping to click his heels, before going back to taking cuts alone
with his soaked black lumber.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly it is obvious. It all makes perfect sense. At that
moment, even the teen-agers in the covered grandstand _ arguing if
that really is the Heisman Trophy favorite in the gaudy, soaked,
candy-apple-red Muckdogs uniform _ can see why Ricky Williams still
plays minor-league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to run the bases, but they said we're not allowed,''
Williams says, flashing the smile that someday soon will sell
hamburgers or sporting goods or whatever he chooses.
</P>
<P>
   If he is disappointed to have been restricted to the on-deck
circle, it doesn't show. There will be another game tomorrow, even
if another four hours on the bus must come first. And that _
another game, another chance to hit ground balls and get down the
line impossibly fast, another day to read a curveball correctly, to
steal a base, to simply play _ is all he needs.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 21, could have been ridiculously wealthy by now had
he, as expected, chosen to skip his senior year at Texas to declare
himself available for the NFL draft. His summer living room, he
says, is the team ``arcade.'' He could have had Disneyland. Having
turned down millions, he plays in a league in which players earn a
free sandwich for extra-base hits.
</P>
<P>
   But sitting about 35 miles east of Buffalo in a summer rental
duplex in Batavia, N.Y., a relative shack with no air-conditioning
decorated in early pizza box and Taco Bell wrapper, Williams
wonders how he could have even considered leaving school with a
year left to play.
</P>
<P>
   He could be back in Austin, training for his run at the Heisman
and, with a season to match last, the record as the most prolific
college running back ever. This is no small matter to him; at his
January news conference to announce his decision, he knew the
precise number of yards he needed _ 1,928 _ to surpass Tony
Dorsett.
</P>
<P>
   He could be home in San Diego where it's cool, relaxing for the
football season to come while exercising his competitive fires on
Nintendo, which still inspires him to pump fists and high-five
while bouncing on his couch as happily as Tom Hanks in Big.
</P>
<P>
   But a few days of watching Williams play minor-league baseball
makes it obvious: he could be nowhere else. This fourth season on
the bottom rung of the minor-league baseball ladder, these small
towns _ ``We're really in the boonies now,'' he says after the bus
gets lost in the mountains around Oneonta, N.Y. _ and long bus
rides, even the strikeouts and struggles he could escape so easily
make perfect sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He plays with a joy,'' says Tigers scout Scott Boras, sitting
in the front row with a stopwatch, a clipboard and 41 years in
baseball. ``It's obvious. He loves to play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams couldn't give that up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would I?'' he says. ``I've always played baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I contemplated (leaving football) a couple of years ago,''
Williams reveals. ``I really thought about quitting football. I
wasn't very close, but I thought about it a lot. There was just no
way I could call (former Texas) coach (John) Mackovic and say I'm
not coming back to (instead) play baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm doing well, I want to just do baseball. When I do
badly, I just want to quit and go play football. But I'm going to
play at least three or four more years. I can see myself playing in
the NFL for four years and saying, `OK, I'm just going to play
baseball.' I could be here for three more years and be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mucks are down 8-0 heading into the bottom of the ninth, and
they are not coming back. Williams has gotten his daily hit and
will stop this night at one. His last at-bat produces only a
routine, two-hop ground ball to second.
</P>
<P>
   It is the most exciting, breathtaking play of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Boras knows instantly what he has seen. He doesn't need the
stopwatch for more than the details.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ran a 3.96,'' Boras reports happily.
</P>
<P>
   Williams has long been signed by another club. But Boras feels
that rush of discovery for which scouts live.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 3.96,'' he says. ``That's unreal. I haven't seen that from a
righthanded batter since Willie Wilson, and that was more than 20
years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams was out by the first baseman's stretch on the play. But
he exploded out of the far side of the batter's box and disappeared
down the line as few, other than the occasional Mickey Mantle or Bo
Jackson, ever have.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have gone faster,'' Williams says the next night in
Jamestown, N.Y. ``I was watching to see if (the ball) went through
for a few steps.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really a talented kid,'' Boras says. ``I see why the
Phillies have a tremendous interest in him. To look at him move, to
see him run four-flat down the line with that kind of strength just
to see that kind of size, strength and speed in one package is very
rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very difficult game to play. He just needs time. But
scouts are looking all over the country for that kind of size,
strength and speed.''
</P>
<P>
   If the term ``tools'' to describe parts of a player's game were
not already clich, any discussion of Williams' prospects as a
baseball player would make it so. There are so many levels in
minor-league baseball _ Williams plays for one of the Philadelphia
Phillies' four Class A affiliates and has 30 teammates _ that the
search is always on for rare talents that can be honed later to
major-league standards. The organization will teach young prospects
how to hit. Physical talent, and tools that cannot be taught, are
coveted.
</P>
<P>
   In a baseball uniform, especially in the Muckdogs' road red,
Williams looks huge, football muscles testing the seams around his
shoulders and thighs. His teammates, almost all just off college
campuses, seem smaller, younger. Williams looks as if he should bat
cleanup and attempt to damage the ball or fail magnificently with
every swing.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams bats leadoff with a wide, slightly open stance. He
has learned to swing down on the ball with a compact, controlled
stroke. He gets excited over any at-bat in which he makes solid
contact. Batting .345 through the first week of the season, he beat
out more than half of his infield grounders for hits and was the
New York-Penn League's only batter to hit safely in every game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are five skills in baseball _ hit for average, hit for
power, throw, run and field,'' Williams notes. ``I'm a pretty good
fielder. And I've got a strong arm and speed, so I've got two of
the five now. And they say you learn how to hit, and power will
come later.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he clearly is vastly improved from his first three
seasons of minor-league baseball, Williams insists he needs to get
better in every facet.
</P>
<P>
   An eighth-round pick out of high school, Williams batted .239 in
1995 at Martinsville, Va., and .188 and .206 the past two seasons
at Piedmont, N.C. But in the last few games of his first week for
Batavia, he has made far more consistent contact than in the past.
And it has involved more than just hitting the ball in the dirt and
sprinting down the line.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, making contact and getting down the line is
enough. Almost every analysis of Williams' long-range baseball
prospects includes the caveat, ``If he played all year '' But even
though he has played fewer than 40 games most summers and failed to
escape Class A ball in three seasons, Williams expects to reach the
major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky has definitely got tools,'' Muckdogs manager Frank Klebe
says. ``We're giving him the opportunity to play and produce and
improve his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good baserunner, but he can work on getting better
jumps and stealing bases. He can field his position, but he can
improve tracking to the ball. And he's got an average arm. His arm
strength is well above average, but we're working on his release
point and accuracy. At bat, he has to put the ball in play, cut
down on his strikeouts, be patient, don't swing at bad pitches,
understanding the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the tools he has, if he just wanted to concentrate on
baseball, he'd have a good opportunity to play at the big-league
level. He might still do that. He has the tools, talent and the
drive. He works real hard. And he has fun playing the game. And
Ricky wants to be a star. A lot of guys just want to compete at
their level. You have to want to make that jump. You have to look
inside yourself to say, `I don't want to play at this level; I want
to reach the highest level I can.' It's not selfish to say, `I want
to be the best I can be.' Ricky has that.''
</P>
<P>
   But he always knows he can at any time leave the frustrations of
baseball and enjoy his place and prowess as perhaps college
football's best player. A happy trash-talker in football, he rips
himself in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to work hard,'' he says, ``because I'm not any good.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he doesn't have the same verbal swagger in baseball
that he has in football, Williams responds, ``You can't talk trash
if you can't back it up.''
</P>
<P>
   But when an Erie, N.Y., reporter asks Williams, ``You're
obviously not very good at baseball, so why do you play?'' Williams
is obviously offended.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people say I'm not going to make it in baseball, it
pushes me harder,'' he says. ``I don't care what people think, but
I use it to push me.''
</P>
<P>
   And his football talent, rather than lure him away from
baseball, inspires him. Even as he recognizes and acknowledges his
baseball shortcomings as would a harsh, impartial observer, there
is an underlying confidence that helps keep him in the minor
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It pushes me in baseball because I want to be the best,''
Williams says of his football success. ``I like being the best. I
just keep trying and working hard. I go out there every day and try
to compete in everything I do. I like to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is a plan. He is no longer tempted to give up
football. But when he imagines himself playing only one sport, it's
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have so far to go,'' Williams says. ``It's probably five
years before I'm in the major leagues. But I started at 18. I think
the average age to get in the majors is like, 25. So I still have a
few years to get there. If I'm 28 and play until I'm 35, I'd have
seven years in the bigs. I'd be happy with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams has already singled up the middle when Nick Punto hits
a sharp grounder to Jamestown shortstop Keith Law. Law flips to Ron
Bush at second, but before Bush can complete his pivot to make the
throw to first, before he has time to realize time is running out,
Bush is airborne. Williams has closed the gap to second too fast
and sent Bush flying. It isn't pretty.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is immediately called for baserunner's interference,
with Punto ruled out at first. Klebe argues Williams had not left
the baseline to reach Bush, but while Bush struggles to his feet,
the argument really can get nowhere. ``I guess,'' Klebe says later,
``he needed to get in some contact.''
</P>
<P>
   This might be the most important season ever for pitcher Pete
Mondello, who is a long way from the Show. Batavia is, for most, a
starting point. But Mondello is coming back from arm trouble. This
season will be his first since the pain showed up in his shoulder,
threatening a career that was only just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   But when Mondello phoned home to Port Arthur and his family full
of Texas football fans, he happily reported Ricky Williams was a
teammate. Conversation naturally included a progress report on the
arm, but Mondello was told a package of memorabilia was on its way
to Batavia for Williams' signature.
</P>
<P>
   And though professional athletes don't generally gush about one
another, Mondello, as with most of the Mucks, gets a kick out of
finding a college football All-American in the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be in drills running and I'll think, `OK, all right, I'm
running with Ricky Williams,''' shortstop Matt Denure says. ``Then
I'll look over, and boom, he's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's more than a brush with fame or an up-close look at rare
talent that excites. Virtually every teammate quickly points to
Williams' work ethic and humility, as if they had expected
something very different.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a lot different from a lot of athletes I know,'' Mondello
says. ``He's kind of soft-spoken, but he's smart. I've known a lot
of football players. Leeland McElroy (the former Texas A&AMP;M star
from Beaumont) was kind of a showboat. Ricky is totally different.
He's busting it every day. He does more than I expected. He works
really hard, and he has stayed humble.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams says his lack of mastery in baseball forced that
humility, but he is more than accepted. This is especially
important in the minors, where players are in constant proximity
within the closed confines of buses and Spartan clubhouses.
</P>
<P>
   As the Mucks make their way through the Appalachian Mountains of
upstate New York, few bother to peek out the window. Scenery, no
matter how dramatic, is of little appeal to a bus full of
ballplayers. Usually, the blinds are closed to allow a better view
of the videos that always play. And though they are strong,
testosterone-heavy movies (The Usual Suspects, A Few Good Men,
Heat), most players give them only passing interest.
</P>
<P>
   Williams almost always chooses a game. Nintendo runs constantly
in his temporary living room. Cards, usually spades, are dealt in
the back of the bus.
</P>
<P>
   At Texas, Williams is well-liked, but he has few close friends.
It's different with Batavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get much closer in baseball than football,'' Williams
says. ``In baseball, you're together every single day. You have a
game every day. You practice. You're together for at least six
hours every day, sometimes a lot more. You have to be closer. You
can't be by yourself in baseball. There are times I want to be by
myself, but I can't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he becomes another guy on the bus. And when every game
ends with a dozen or so kids crowding past the rest of the Muckdogs
to chase Williams' autograph, pushing copies of Sports Illustrated
and summer football magazines at him, no one seems to mind being
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   The scene reminds that there is something special about the left
fielder of the Muckdogs, but since he does not seem impressed by
his gifts, there is no reason to hold them against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I thought everybody was joking around, saying that
was him,'' first baseman Shane Carnes says. ``I know he's a
football god in college, so I was skeptical. I knew how good he
was. I've seen him run, but when I saw him, I didn't know it was
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, he's a great guy, level-headed. He plays hard,
and he's so fast. If I was a linebacker, I wouldn't want to tackle
him. And I think he's going to win the Heisman. I really hope he
does, too. I got his autograph. A lot of us have.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning, Williams broke late. A line drive seemed
headed right for him, freezing him for a moment until he had to
take off to his right as the ball hooked. He grabbed it before
there was need for real concern.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, however, there is no doubt, and Williams breaks
immediately, knowing he has plenty of ground to cover. The ball
reaches the alley in left-center when Williams begins to downshift
to settle under it. He makes the catch on the run about five feet
in front of the warning track. Asked later if he had to run
all-out, Williams looks insulted. ``Nah,'' he says. ``I was looking
at it the whole way.''
</P>
<P>
   In the bleachers, 19-year-old Randy Carlson of Gerry, N.Y.,
holds the recent Sports Illustrated with the Williams feature in
it, while his friends, who had long since given up such adolescent
pursuits, chase foul balls that will later bear an opponent's
signature.
</P>
<P>
   Jason ``Love Train'' Smorol is drenched in sweat. He has spent
the past 45 minutes sweeping the bleachers of Dwyer Stadium,
unsatisfied with the work of his grounds crew earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We promise Batavia a clean place to watch baseball,'' says
Smorol, the Muckdogs' general manager who two years ago was a
director of special projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know what a special project is in minor-league
baseball?'' Smorol asks. ``Cleaning the bathrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   A clean stadium is not all that is promised. Every half-inning
has another contest, from lawn bowling in Batavia to grape stomping
in Jamestown. There are mascots (Jamestown trots out two and a
clown) and, at every opportunity, giveways, music and sound
effects. When the game reaches the last call mandated by
professional baseball, fans hear a recording of the John Belushi
line from Animal House: ``My advice to you is to start drinking
heavily.''
</P>
<P>
   And in case anyone forgets there is baseball, a Batavia Wall of
Fame of former stars who made it _ including Cito Gaston, Steve
Blass, Doc Ellis, Manny Sanguillen and Kelly Gruber _ greets every
ticket holder entering the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest controversy in Batavia baseball history was the
offseason vote that named the team the Muckdogs. The more dignified
``Clippers'' was determined in a copyright case to belong to the
New York Yankees and their farm team, the Columbus Clippers.
Everything from the Rocks to the Pancakes was proposed for Batavia.
When Muckdogs, suggested in honor of the guardians of the produce
grown in western New York's rich ``muck'' soil, won, the small town
was in an uproar.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Smorol and his three-person staff (which swells to 35 on
game nights) sell everything possible with Muckdogs on it.
Minor-league gear, the more peculiar the better, is hot, and Smorol
estimates he can move at least $50,000 in merchandise this summer.
The most popular contest is the nightly search for the loudest
bark.
</P>
<P>
   Having the Heisman Trophy favorite dropped at the top of the
lineup would seem a minor-league dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't usually get the Houston Chronicle, Dallas Morning
News and CNN around here,'' Smorol said. ``I told him whatever
attention he brings is good for us, and it's good for him, too. But
we won't use it. We won't say, `Now batting, Heisman Trophy
contender Ricky Williams.' That would be too cheesy. We're real
cheesy, but that's too much, even for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to dress him up and take him out to sell
tickets. That's supposed to be our job.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Muckdogs hit Oneonta, they have, as Smorol puts
it, ``stepped back in time.''
</P>
<P>
   In Oneonta, there are no clowns or mascots, no contests, no
cartoon characters on the uniforms. The O-Yanks wear Yankees
pinstripes with a white `O' on a blue hat. Beer is not sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to demean anybody, but we're not the Muckdogs,'' says
Oneonta business manager John Nader, a college economics professor
whose father, Sam, brought the minors back to his hometown in 1966
because he believed small towns should have baseball. ``We're about
baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of life in the minors means becoming part of the silly,
intentionally tacky, innocent show. Jamestown sells itself as ``The
Greatest Show on Dirt.'' Batavia is ``Taking a bite out of the
minor leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   But to Williams, and all the Pete Mondellos and Shane Carneses,
none of that matters. Because with the minor leagues comes a chance
to keep a dream going and play ball. Most believe themselves so far
from the majors that they don't even consider the potential riches.
As with Williams, the emphasis is on improvement on every road trip
and with each at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who is much more likely to enjoy hefty professional
paydays, says he knows little of the off-field, real-world
realities of the $2.8 million of insurance he carries. He has $1.8
million in coverage through the NCAA's Exceptional Student-Athlete
Disability Insurance program and another $1 million policy secured
by his family. Unless injured, he will pay $26,000 in premiums.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams says the only insurance he needs is the degree he
his chasing in Elementary Education. Besides, neither football nor
baseball is, he says, his ultimate career. No matter what the NFL
or baseball bring, whether he wins the Heisman or takes Dorsett's
record or ever wears a Phillies uniform, Williams says he would
like to eventually teach elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   And as Williams, one of the nation's most celebrated college
football talents, stands swinging a bat in the rain in Oneonta, it
is difficult to doubt him.

NBA FANS JUST MIGHT SAY GOOD-BYE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The NBA is on the verge of locking out its
players, to which we say, hey, don't forget to throw away the key.
</P>
<P>
   The people safeguarding the league have broken our trust. They
have us unhinged, unsettled, upset.
</P>
<P>
   We're disturbed by a league in which spin doctors are more in
demand than orthopedic surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   The past few months have seen the Golden State Warriors hire a
public relations firm to polish their image, the Warriors' Donyell
Marshall retain an agency to trumpet his candidacy for the league's
most-improved-player award and former NBA coach Bob Hill enlist
outside sources to champion his return to the league.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, former No. 1 draft pick Greg Anderson is being
indicted by a federal grand jury on drug and money laundering
charges and Charlotte forward Anthony Mason is pleading guilty to
misdemeanor child endangerment and Philadelphia guard Allen Iverson
is on probation for misdemeanor charges of marijuana possession and
Washington forward Juwan Howard is suing a woman who accused him of
sexual assault at a 3 a.m. party at his house.
</P>
<P>
   The woman's allegations, Howard said, ``have done irreparable
harm to my reputation and image.''
</P>
<P>
   If Howard can sue for emotional distress, then what's to stop
basketball fans from seeking a divorce from the NBA on the grounds
of irreconcilable differences?
</P>
<P>
   We're really disturbed by the antics of Howard's friend and
erstwhile teammate Chris Webber, who before he was exiled to
Sacramento had the gall to complain because Wizards owner Abe
Pollin's jet wasn't cushy enough. If a private plane left Webber
cramped and cranky, just think how he would have handled playing
back in the days when commercial flights and lengthy layovers were
the norm. Yo, Chris, call a timeout to count your blessings.
</P>
<P>
   We're disturbed by all the players who have millions of dollars
but not one red cent worth of perspective. They look at the
league's $2.64 billion dollar deal with NBC and Turner and the
through-the-roof ratings of this year's NBA Finals and forget that
it wasn't always so. As recently as 1980, the final game of the NBA
Finals between the Lakers and the Philadelphia 76ers was shown on
tape delay.
</P>
<P>
   The younger players, especially, gaze out at Michael Jordan's
vast endorsement empire and demand their own commonwealth just
because they have a few highlight-reel moves, completely
overlooking the fact that Jordan's graciousness and goodness were
as integral to his sovereign rule as his tongue-wagging,
gravity-defying dunks and pit-bull defense.
</P>
<P>
   We're really disturbed by the sneaker officials who do nothing
to sharpen the players' focus. They bestow upon the likes of
Iverson a shoe deal that's worth more than his 76ers contract
before he has recorded his first assist of any significance, then
profess to be shocked and dismayed when he turns out not to be as
polished as a sneaker stuffed with paper and tucked away in a box
in some storeroom.
</P>
<P>
   We're disturbed by everyone who puts the bandwagon before the
horse, then complains that it's not moving. That includes all the
owners who lavish $100 million contracts on players who are long on
potential but short on results.
</P>
<P>
   The owners are saying they need a hard salary cap to curb
payrolls that are eating up 57 percent of the league's
basketball-related income instead of the 48 percent agreed upon in
the last collective bargaining agreement. The owners swear they
need both a ceiling on the amount they're able to spend to re-sign
their own free agents and longer contracts for rookies so they
aren't obligated to lavish huge contracts on still-unproven talent.
</P>
<P>
   What they're really telling us, of course, is they have neither
the restraint nor resolve to balance their own books. They must be
saved not from the players but from themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It disturbs us that team officials are throwing a lot of money
into the hands of a relative few. This past season, the 37
highest-paid players accounted for one-third of the total payroll
while 22 percent of the players earned the minimum of $272,250.
</P>
<P>
   We're really disturbed by teams who give short shrift to hard
work and loyalty, whose bright idea of trimming expenses is to cut
out the heart of a team and ship it to one of the sorriest
franchises in the league in return for that old elixir, youth.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks traded veteran role player Charles Oakley, he of the
Herculean work ethic, to Toronto last week for Marcus Camby, a
former No. 1 draft pick who has been called unmotivated by some,
fragile by others and is, by consensus, a player whose promise
remains largely untapped.
</P>
<P>
   The trade is emblematic of an NBA that's at a crossroads, with
players who feel a responsibility to their teams, who believe a
paycheck is earned and not owed, giving way to a generation that
largely presumes teams exist solely for its benefit.
</P>
<P>
   We're disturbed by a league in which Kenny Anderson and Rony
Seikaly exercise the final say over where they'll play even after
they are traded and Latrell Sprewell chokes his coach and a couple
of teams clamor for his services and Washington general manager Wes
Unseld is moved to issue an apology to his fans for his players'
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   If that's all in a day's work in the NBA, perhaps it's just as
well that business be suspended. &QL;

VAN EXEL TO MEET WITH NUGGETS
</HEADLINE>
 EXEL-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nick Van Exel has agreed to report to the Denver Nuggets and is
scheduled to take a physical exam today in order to complete last
week's trade from the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Van Exel will meet with the Nuggets and Denver media this
afternoon, nearly four days after the draft-night deal in which the
Lakers shipped out their All-Star point guard for second-year
forward Tony Battie and rookie guard Tyronn Lue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Needless to say, we're thrilled,'' said Nuggets spokesman
Tommy Sheppard.
</P>
<P>
   Van Exel's agent had indicated in recent weeks that his client
would not accept a trade to certain teams, though he never
specified which ones and maintained that it didn't need to be a
contender.
</P>
<P>
   But Van Exel didn't speak with Nuggets officials until Friday
and, even then, didn't say when he would be reporting, leaving the
trade in doubt. Failure to report for a physical by 4 p.m. Monday
would have allowed the Nuggets to void the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Denver general manager Dan Issel assured Van Exel that the team,
which suffered through a franchise-worst 11-71 season, was
committed to winning and planned to land a major free agent to
complement Van Exel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't promise him we'd win as many as the Lakers last year,
but with his help we'd be improved,'' Issel told the Denver Post.
</P>
<P>
   Both Issel and Van Exel's representatives said it was the trade
itself _ and not the destination _ that had Van Exel upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he was hesitant to come here,'' Issel said. ``I
think he's upset that L.A. would trade him.''

CLINTON AND JIANG ENGAGE IN LIVELY DEBATE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ In an extraordinary exchange aired live on Chinese
television, President Clinton and President Jiang Zemin debated
Saturday the meaning of the Tiananmen Square massacre and the
merits of personal freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   The 70-minute news conference at the Great Hall of the People
marked an unprecedented display of openness for the Chinese as
Clinton and Jiang embarked on a summit condemned by many human
rights activists in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Standing beneath an ornate gold base relief of a mountainous
landscape, Clinton and Jiang engaged in a lively give-and-take that
touched on Taiwan, Tibet and the campaign finance scandal in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``As China and the United States have different social systems,
ideologies, values and culture traditions, we have some differences
of views on certain issues. However, they should not become the
obstacles in the way of the growth of China-U.S. relations,'' Jiang
said in his opening remarks.
</P>
<P>
   But the Chinese leader staunchly defended his country's actions
both in the 1989 massacre of hundreds of democracy demonstrators in
Tiananmen Square and in placing limits on personal expression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had the Chinese government not taken the resolute measures,
then we could not have enjoyed the stability that we are enjoying
today,'' Jiang insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton countered that stability can best be had through greater
personal freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a lot of personal freedom, some people may abuse
it. But if you are so afraid of ... the abuse that you limit
people's freedom too much, then you pay, I believe, an even higher
price in a world where the whole economy is based on ideas and
information and exchange and debate,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps to ease criticism at home, Clinton condemned the
Tiananmen Square crackdown in his opening remarks, saying the two
nations disagree about its meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe, and the American people believe, that the use of
force and the tragic loss of life was wrong. I believe, and the
American people believe, that freedom of speech, association and
religion are, as recognized by the U.N. Charter, the right of
people everywhere and should be protected by their governments,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang noted the United States is the most developed nation in
the world, with an average income of $30,000 while China is a
developing nation with 1.2 billion people earning less than $700 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``China stresses that the top priority should be given to the
right to subsistence and the right to development,'' Jiang said.
``Meanwhile, efforts should be made to strengthen democracy and the
legal system and to protect the economic, social, cultural, civil
and political rights of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   The lengthy news conference, in which the two leaders took four
questions from reporters, marked a highlight for Clinton's nine-day
visit here, the first for a U.S. president since the Tiananmen
incident.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the president's trip has been marred by the arrest of
four dissidents and the attempt by Chinese authorities to stop
Clinton's two Asian-American valets from boarding Air Force One in
Xi'an for the flight to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang defended the detentions while maintaining that in China
``people are the masters of the nation.'' He insisted journalists
were free to conduct interviews ``within the scope of law'' and
that local authorities should take action when ``some activities
that have been detrimental or have prejudiced the security.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporters covering the visit got a first-hand look at some
protesters when a man and a woman lay down in front of a bus
carrying journalists from the State Dinner. Authorities dragged
them away before their cause or intentions could be determined. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The series of arrests came on the heels of massive criticism
from liberal and conservative activists in the United States who
wanted Clinton to cancel the trip, or at least bypass the official
welcoming ceremony on the steps of the Great Hall of the People,
which overlooks Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger, the president's national security
adviser, hailed the summit sessions as an ``extraordinary day in
the evolution of U.S.-China relations.'' He maintained the two-hour
meeting between the two leaders and the freewheeling news
conference graphically demonstrated the value of engaging China.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing, Clinton and Jiang reached a series of agreements,
including the largely symbolic gesture of removing each other's
cities as nuclear targets.
</P>
<P>
   They also agreed that the United States could inspect the uses
of U.S. high technology exports to ensure their use for civilian
purposes, a prelude for greater export of dual-use technology,
items which can be of both military and commercial significance.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also reiterated the U.S. one-China policy which does not
recognize independence for Taiwan. But he urged China to engage in
a peaceful dialogue with Taiwanese leaders for reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton later met with Premier Zhu Rongji, the economic reformer
who promised to hold the value of the yuan currency despite the
pressures from the Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang, who apologized for taking so much time with his answers
in the news conference, made unprompted comments on the campaign
finance scandal in the United States and the status of the Dalai
Lama and Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   He called charges that China tried to influence the 1996 U.S.
elections with illegal campaign contributions ``absurd and
ridiculous and I think they are sheer fabrications.'' He said China
has conducted an ``earnest investigation'' of the charges and
concluded ``there was never such a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Jiang concluded the news conference by announcing he wanted to
say something about the Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader in
exile. The Chinese president said if the Dalai Lama will make a
public statement recognizing Tibet as an ``inalienable part'' of
China and recognizing Taiwan as ``a province'' of China, then the
``door to dialogue and negotiation is open.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, noting his comments likely would be unpopular,
predicted if the Dalai Lama and Jiang met ``they would like each
other very much.''
</P>
<P>
   The president and first lady later attended an official state
dinner at the Great Hall of the People where Clinton and Jiang took
turns conducting the People's Liberation Army band.

   The New York media never have given the Braves much respect.
When Atlanta visited the Bronx for two games last week, New York
Post writer Joel Sherman wrote a column under the headline:
``Atlanta keeps up its tradition of failure.'' Wrote Sherman on the
Braves' bullpen: ``A 1998 World Series preview was held and a 1996
review broke out. ... This has been an Atlanta formula for disaster
this decade.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: As long as the Orioles stay within striking distance of
Boston for the wild-card spot, they will not trade either second
baseman Roberto Alomar or first baseman Rafael Palmeiro. ``We still
think we can get to the playoffs, but we have to get our pitching
staff healthy,'' assistant general manager Kevin Malone said. ...
Billy Ashley, a bust with the Dodgers, is back in the majors now
that the Red Sox have traded Jim Leyritz. Ashley, a right-handed
bat who will take Leyritz's DH platoon job, and was hitting .297 at
Class AAA Pawtucket with 10 homers and 45 RBIs in 50 games. ...
George Steinbrenner has won three World Series with the Yankees,
but he aid about the current version: ``I don't know of any better.
But I wouldn't want to put a label on them.'' You just did, George.

   Talk about not handling young pitchers properly: Indians manager
Mike Hargrove made a mistake a grievous error recently when he let
the young Bartolo Colon throw 139 pitches in a start. Hargrove
didn't ask pitching coach Mark Wiley how many pitches Colon had
thrown going into the eighth inning. ``I usually have a good feel
for number of pitches,'' Hargrove said. ``When Bartolo went out for
the eighth, I figured he had about 90.'' Colon actually had 114.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Twins pitcher Bob Tewksbury lasted only five outs in a
9-0 loss at Houston recently. ``They put away all the scalpels in
the trainer's room, so I can't slit my wrists,'' he said. ... When
the Tigers use Paul Bako behind the plate, the club is 14-11.
Bako's the only Detroit player with a winning record when starting.
... White Sox starter Jason Bere, 3-7 with a 6.02 ERA, was demoted
to the bullpen and blamed his problems on manager Jerry Manuel.
``The games he took me out, he didn't give me the benefit of the
doubt,'' said Bere, who was quickly placed on the trading block.
... Twins veteran Paul Molitor (broken rib) is on the disabled list
for the 14th time in his career, the most of any active player.
</P>
<P>
   West
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are looking frantically for pitching, with a June
ERA of 5.87, after an earlier 12-game stretch at 7.92. The team is
considering several pitchers, including Montreal's Carlos Perez and
Cincinnati's Pete Harnisch. But manager Johnny Oates said, ``We got
to stop thinking that (owner) Tom Hicks and (general manager) Doug
Melvin are going to come in here riding on two big white horses and
bring Mr. X here.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: How has Anaheim taken the division lead from the Rangers,
despite the fact that starters Ken Hill, Jack McDowell and Allen
Watson are on the disabled list? Their replacements _ Omar Olivares
Steve Sparks and Jarrod Washburn _ are a combined 10-2. ... The
Angels already have 21 come-from-behind wins. ... The reason the
A's picked up Bip Roberts from Detroit was to use him at as second
base until Scott Spiezio recovers from a knee injury, which is
expected to keep him out a month. ... Said Barry Bonds on about
Oakland's Rickey Henderson: ``He's the greatest leadoff hitter of
all time, without a doubt. The numbers don't lie. If he's the best
statistically, he deserves to be considered the best. Like Michael
Jordan.'' ... Seattle's new ballpark, which opens in 1999, will
have a grass surface, but this season the team is just 6-25 on the
natural stuff.

 &HT;    Braves snapped out thrree-game losing streak with a win over the
Blue Jays
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The Atlanta Braves hit the half mark Saturday night,
Greg Maddux using the whip on them as if riding a rented mule. It
was still daylight when he made his 104th and final pitch, which
says everything necessary about how the Braves beat Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   With Michael Tucker and Ryan Klesko hitting solo homers in the
seventh inning, Atlanta snapped out of a three-game slide with a
2-0 victory over the Blue Jays, and it was inconceivable that
Maddux (11-2) could have pitched better. Striking out a
career-high13, he gave up eight singles and still recorded his
NL-high third shutout and his 100th victory as a Brave. And with
his club treading water in a 3-7 stretch, his timing was
appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well,'' said Chipper Jones, ''it's better than the
alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves hence closed out the first half of the schedule at
52-29, matching the best start in Atlanta history and giving them a
shot at the franchise victory mark of 104 (set in 1993). Their lead
in the NL East returned to 7 1/2 games over New York and put a
tighter spin on a 13-11 June.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll take the same in the second half,'' said manager Bobby
Cox. ''We had a great first half. We just had a bum week.''
</P>
<P>
   Matched in a remarkable duel with Toronto's Juan Guzman, who
pitched nothing like a man with just seven wins in his last 29
games, Maddux was locked into a scoreless tie the first six
innings. With his change-up unusually effective on the right-handed
hitters, he struck out seven of the first 16 men he faced and he
allowed just two men past first base all night. Still, the Braves
could not give him a lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't ever freaking look back. You can't,'' said Maddux,
who now leads the NL in wins, shutouts and ERA (1.64). ''You have
to keep pitching. The minute you start patting yourself on the
back, you mentally let down. So I don't do it. And you know what?
Guzman was pitching great too. How come he gave up the two home
runs?''
</P>
<P>
   With a highly effective split-finger fastball, Guzman held the
Braves to two singles into the seventh. But Tucker got one up in
the strike zone to lead off the seventh and drove it over the
center-field wall for his 11th homer of the season but just his
second since May 20. Following a Chipper Jones groundout, Klesko
next sent a deep drive into the right-field seats for a 2-0 lead.
The homer was Klesko's 13th homer, his fifth in the last 18 games,
during which he has driven in 14 runs.
</P>
<P>
   And that was it, though Maddux needed a double play to help
escape the ninth when the first two men up singled. As the Braves
filed off the field, most noted after a 1:46 game _ the quickest in
the majors this season _ it was still light out.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was telling the guys,'' said Jones, ``we should go ahead and
get tomorrow's game over with tonight so we could have two days
off. I might as well get my 0-for-7 out of the way real quick.''

 &HT;    Millwood will get some time in bullpen
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Management maintains it has nothing to do with his
recent work on the mound, but with an off-day coming Monday, Kevin
Millwood will skip his next scheduled start and will be available
to work out of the bullpen until the middle of the week. His next
start will fall next Friday, in the first of three games with the
visiting Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's to be expected,'' Millwood said. ``It's happened a couple
times already this year. I haven't been throwing real well, to say
the least. It's been on my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike recent years, manager Bobby Cox has tried this season to
keep the first four starters on a four-day rotation and with John
Smoltz on and off the disabled list, Millwood's schedule has not
been affected often. Although Millwood has allowed 12 runs (14
hits) in 4 2/3 innings in his last two starts, Cox maintains he
would have made the same decision to pass over him if he had won
his last two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's life as a fifth starter,'' Cox said. ``If the other
guys want an off-day, that's fine. But we've done this a lot. Most
starters don't like to be set back.''
</P>
<P>
   Following Monday's off-day, Denny Neagle, John Smoltz and Greg
Maddux will pitch the series at Tampa Bay in order. Millwood hopes
the downtime will give him a chance to work on his pitches,
particularly his breaking ball. After his rapid 7-1 start in his
first 10 outings, he is trying to treat the current swoon as a
matter of course, and nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens to everybody,'' Millwood said. ``It's just
something you got to work out.No Cat again
</P>
<P>
   The team has scratched first baseman Andres Galarraga for today
and have set sights on returning him to the lineup Tuesday at Tampa
Bay. Galarraga was able to take ground balls during batting
practice but still has not swung a bat since Tuesday. In the first
three games he missed, the Braves did not drive in a run from the
clean-up position, No. 4 replacement hitters going a collective
2-for-11. It should be noted the Braves did not have a runner in
scoring position in any of those 11 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Time marches on
</P>
<P>
   The club refuses to set any timetable for the possible return of
closer Mark Wohlers, currently on minor-league assignment in
Orlando. But management acknowledges now that Wohlers couldn't
possibly be back until after the All-Star break (July 9) at the
earliest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to say that,'' said general manager John Schuerholz.
``(The break) is only a week away and he hasn't begun to pitch in
competition yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Working overtime
</P>
<P>
   Over the previous 16 innings entering Saturday's game, Atlanta's
bullpen has produced just five 1-2-3 innings. Mike Cather has been
the most effective with two of those innings but has also given up
three runs in his last three appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Canseco was a late scratch from the Blue Jays' lineup,
replaced by Juan Samuel. Canseco strained his back swinging at an
inside pitch from Mike Cather in his last at-bat Friday night and
was troubled by spasms before the game. ... Irene Saez, Miss
Universe 1981 from Venezuela, was at Turner Field before the game
to film an ad with the Braves' Venezuelan contingent. Currently the
mayor of Chacao, a city adjacent to Caracas, Seaz is running for
Venezuela's president and a photo opportunity with Galarraga, Ozzie
Guillen and Eddie Perez couldn't hurt. Incidently, a woman is
ineligible to run for president in Venezuela unless she is married
and Saez is single. For the record, Galarraga, Guillen and Perez
are all hitched.

 &HT;    On deck:Toronto blue jays
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: 1:10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   TV, radio: TBS, 750-AM.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: LHP Tom Glavine (10-3, 2.72; first
appearance vs. Blue Jays) vs. RHP Chris Carpenter (4-2, 4.65; first
appearance vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The only Braves starter to beat the New York Yankees,
Glavine reached 10 victories in 16 starts. Last year in his season
of 12 no-decisions, Glavine did not win his 10th game until his
20th start on July 16. He has lost only once in his last nine
games, that to Florida 3-2 on June 18. He has worked at least into
the seventh inning 12 times and has yielded more than three earned
runs in just three starts. Seven times, he has given up only one
run or less. His current 2.72 ERA is a half-run less than his 3.40
career rate entering the season. His only experience against the
Blue Jays came in the 1992 World Series when he allowed just three
earned runs in two starts but still went only 1-1. Carpenter,
Toronto's first pick in the 1993 draft, has begun to show the
ability that management hopes will help lead the franchise back
from some medicore seasons. The Jays' fifth starter, he will be
making his ninth start and will show the Braves a fastball that
tops out in the mid-90s. He is still learning to change speeds, a
last step in his development that should help reduce a high hit
ratio (76 hits in 69 2/3 innings). Just 23, he is in his first full
season in the majors.

   Lasorda's team again
</P>
<P>
   By I.J. Rosenberg
</P>
<P>
   c. 19998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- As usual, Tommy Lasorda has won.
</P>
<P>
   While almost every vestige of Dodger tradition has been either
eliminated or stepped on, Lasorda has survived and is back on top.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza. Gone.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Russell. Gone.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Claire. Gone.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional Dodger uniform. Gone next year.
</P>
<P>
   But not Lasorda, not the 70-year-old Hall of Famer who pulled
the perfect power play. Now, instead of running the team from the
dugout, he's the general manager. The man who once was one of the
game's biggest ambassadors _ and best managers _ is calling the
shots again in Chavez Ravine.
</P>
<P>
   They are calling him temporary GM, but getting Lasorda out now
would be like trying to pry a bowl of spaghetti from his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda was sneaky smart, quickly catering to Fox executives
while they were in the process of buying the club. According to
ESPN's Peter Gammons, Lasorda traveled everywhere on the personal
jet of Michael Milken, who brokered the sale and is a
behind-the-scenes power in the ownership. Fox was tired of the
club's bland personalities _ manager Russell and GM Claire _ out
front and was won over by Lasorda's magnetism.
</P>
<P>
   The question is who Lasorda will choose as the next Dodgers
manager. In place right now is the interim Glenn Hoffman, but he is
expected to be back in the minors next year, barring a great
finish.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda would like Mets manager Bobby Valentine to work under
him. Valentine was the Dodgers' first-round pick in 1968 and played
in the minors for Lasorda. Valentine has a three-year, $2.1 million
contract with the Mets, who insist that he doesn't have any escape
clause in the contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have one of the greatest jobs in the world,'' Valentine
said. ``I'm not desirous of any other job.'' Another interesting
move Lasorda might make is bringing back Piazza, now with the Mets
and a free agent after the season. Lasorda is Piazza's godfather,
and Piazza's father is Lasorda's closest childhood friend. When
asked about the possibility of going back to L.A., Piazza said, ``I
can't answer about the past. I can't answer about the future. I'm
dealing with the present.''
</P>
<P>
   But whatever happens, don't let the ``interim'' in Lasorda's
title fool you. He's back in charge, back trying to put the Dodgers
on top again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom will be involved in all the decisions from here on out,''
team president Dan Graziano said.
</P>
<P>
   Funny _ isn't that what Claire said earlier this year?

 &HT;    Mast in a Sears groove
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SONOMA, CALIF. _ Listen to Rick Mast for a couple of seconds and
you wouldn't expect this Virginia farm boy to be a spokesman for
higher education. He's a guy who, at 16, traded a cow for his first
race car.
</P>
<P>
   But here he is at Sears Point Raceway testifying that even at 41
you're never too old to get more educatin'.
</P>
<P>
   Mast starts seventh in today's Save Mart/Kragen 350 at Sears
Point on the basis of a qualifying speed of 97.907 mph. It gives
the 10-year veteran a chance at a decent finish.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon starts on the pole beside the surprising Jerry
Nadeau. Winston Cup points leader Jeremy Mayfield, a winner for the
first time last week at Pocono, Pa., starts fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Mast has had a mostly luckless career. He's started 260 races,
won none. He has seven top-five finishes, 31 top-10s. His best
finish this year is 11th, twice. He's led only 61 laps in the No.
75 Ford Taurus.
</P>
<P>
   His history on this track is just as dismal. Six races, started
as close as 24th once and finished as high as 11th. He didn't even
qualify here last year.
</P>
<P>
   So while other drivers with more impressive overall performances
struggle to make sense of this road course that features right-hand
turns, narrow turns lined with tires and a new configuration called
The Chute, Mast has been performing like an honor graduate of a
road-race driving school.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that hurt me was I guess I was the only
driver that never went to one of these schools,'' Mast said. ``And
I've never been to these places and tested. Those two things seemed
to help me out tremendously this year.''
</P>
<P>
   So two months ago, Mast enrolled in the Bondurant road-racing
school in Phoenix and he feels so enlightened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned the technique,'' Mast said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we do in oval-track racing, enter the turns where there's
no mark or anything that I use, you drive by feel when you get out
of the gas, slant into the banking. The car does whatever it does
and you try to accelerate as quick as you can to exit.
</P>
<P>
   ``In road racing, there's a mark, hit the brakes. There's a
mark, shift. There's a mark, turn the wheel. In road racing, as you
enter the turn, the brake has to do what the banking does to the
car in oval-track racing. That's what always got me into trouble in
qualifying, over-running all the turns, trying to get into the
turns too fast.''
</P>
<P>
   The experience has been a boost to Mast's confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an awfully good race car,'' he said. ``This is a new
car. We tested out here with it and I went to the school deal. I
don't know how much has made the difference. I think it's half me
and half the race car.''
</P>
<P>
   He's thinking maybe his luck has changed. He looks over his
winless career and muses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always different things with the car,'' Mast said. ``The
left front apron fell off at Michigan once. Water pump give out at
Charlotte once. We got in somebody's oil at Charlotte once. We lost
a cylinder at Pocono once. Just on and on and on. There's about
13-14 races like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to look back over the last three-four years if I had
no races that I had a shot at winning, I wouldn't be doing this.
Believe me, I would not. Because there's too many people that put
too much into it.''

 &HT;    Lepage bolts Falk for Roush Racing
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SONOMA, Calif. _ Smack in the middle of wine country, sour
grapes were flying everywhere Saturday at Sears Point Raceway
concerning Kevin Lepage, a rookie driver who has yet to win a
Winston Cup race.
</P>
<P>
   In quick order, Roush Racing confirmed that it has hired Lepage
for the 1999 season. Roush, which manages nine Nascar teams
including Winston Cup, Busch and truck series, has a 30-day option
to figure out where to place Lepage.
</P>
<P>
   Still smarting from this development, Lepage's current boss, LJ
Racing owner Joe Falk informed Lepage after second-round qualifying
that he would replace him with Tommy Kendall in the No. 91
Chevrolet for today's Save Mart/Kragen 350.
</P>
<P>
   Lepage balked and quit.
</P>
<P>
   The 91 car goes into today's race as a provisional entry after
its second-round qualifying speed, 95.114 mph, placed it 45th among
the 48 cars trying to make the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe Falk ain't the richest guy in this garage, but I've got
enough money to run this car for the rest of the year,'' Falk said.
``We were close to signing a sponsor. That sponsor wanted Kevin, so
I wouldn't doubt if you see a Roush car with that sponsor.''
</P>
<P>
   Countered Lepage: ``Joe Falk is trying to get a sponsor but with
the way he handled the situation like this people got to wonder if
it was a wise decision from a business standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Lepage and Falk had a handshake agreement that came undone last
week when Lepage gave his car owner a two-week notice. Falk will
now get help from Team Sabco owner Felix Sabates, whose No. 46
Chevy Kendall had failed to qualify in. Lepage was heading home to
North Carolina, without a ride for next weekend's Winston Cup race
at Daytona Beach and certain his status as second in rookie point
standings will have diminished. Rumor, however, has him replacing
Ted Musgrave in Roush's No. 16 Ford as early as next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping it wouldn't come down to this,'' Lepage said.
``If it wasn't for me being part of the race team and working hard,
we wouldn't be in a position for a provisional. But obviously they
felt that with Tom Kendall having road-race experience they would
be in a much better situation with him behind the wheel. I'm
disappointed.'' Kendall becomes the beneficiary in all of this. He
won 11 straight road races on the SCCA circuit last season and
wound up without a ride this year. He's started 11 Winston Cup road
races with a best finish of eighth at Watkins Glen in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Martin sets pace
</P>
<P>
   Mark Martin led the competition in the second round of
qualifying Saturday with a lap of 98.147 mph. He'll start 26th.
Martin's practice-lap speed of 98.983 mph was faster than Jeff
Gordon's pole speed of 98.711
</P>
<P>
   Speed hurts
</P>
<P>
   Lake Speed, who bruised ribs in a practice accident Friday, ran
four practice laps Saturday before quitting because of discomfort.
He'll decide on his status for today's race in the morning. Butch
Gilliland qualified the No. 9 Ford Taurus.
</P>
<P>
   Pedersen takes Yahoo
</P>
<P>
   Ken Petersen, driving a Chevy, won the 64-lap Yahoo! Sports 200
Nascar Featherlite Southwest Series race, his third win in the
series.

</P>
<P>
   With Todd Hundley close to returning, the Mets aren't sure where
they are going to play him. Because he underwent reconstructive
elbow surgery and the club wants to take some work off that part of
the body, it's doubtful that he would return to catcher. ``That
could be 1,400 throws (to the pitcher) in a week, when you figure
in all the throws before innings,'' Hundley said. With Mike Piazza
catching, Hundley might end up in left field.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The new Hall of Fame program is out, and Braves announcer
Don Sutton figures prominently on the front in a Dodgers uniform,
and, yes, he's wearing curls. Sutton will be the 62nd pitcher
inducted. The ceremonies are July 26. ... The Phillies' Bobby Abreu
has 11 assists, tops among major-league outfielders. ... Since July
28 of last season, the Phillies have the third-best record in the
league at 77-58, trailing the Braves (86-49) and Giants (78-57).
... The Marlins are considering replacing the slumping Derrek Lee
at first base with minor-leaguer Kevin Millar
</P>
<P>
   Central
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs are disappointed with center fielder Lance Johnson.
Many of his teammates think that nothing is physically wrong with
Johnson, who insists he has a hand problem and can't play. He is
starting to become a distraction in the clubhouse, and the team may
try to trade him. But moving Johnson will be difficult because he
makes $4.9 million this year and $5.1 million in 1999. One report
has Johnson going to Colorado, which needs a center fielder and
leadoff hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Pirates catcher Jason Kendall has become a master of the
plunking. Kendall was hit by a pitch 31 times last year and has
been struck 11 times this season. ``I'm one of those players who's
going to do anything I can to help the team win,'' he said. ...
Proving that St. Louis has never seen much power before Mark
McGwire, only three Cardinals over the last half century have hit
33 home runs in one season. McGwire already has 35. Those three old
Redbird longballers were Stan Musial, Dick Allen and, most
recently, Jack Clark. ... Speaking of the Cardinals, an interesting
quote about draft choice J.D. Drew comes from his manager in the
Northern League. Marty Scott of the St. Paul Saints: ``Money is not
a driving force in his life, as far as I can tell.'' ... Cubs first
baseman Mark Grace is 33-for-89 this month but has just two RBIs.
The reason is that Sammy Sosa, hitting ahead of him, has 19 homers
in June.
</P>
<P>
   West
</P>
<P>
   With Bobby Bonilla on the disabled list, the Dodgers have
promoted from Class AA San Antonio power-hitting third baseman
Adrian Beltre, perhaps the top prospect in the organization.
Beltre, 20, was hitting .321 with 13 home runs and 56 RBIs. If he
can handle major-league pitching, he may end up as the club's
starter at third, no matter what happens with Bonilla.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Padres starter Kevin Brown is 6-0 in his last seven
starts. ... When San Diego's Tony Gwynn recently went hitless for
14 at-bats, it was the longest drought of his career. He broke out
of it by going 3-for-4. More Gwynn: He has just one fewer home run
(seven) than strikeouts (eight) and is threatening to become only
the second player since 1958 to finish with more homers than
strikeouts. In 1980, Kansas City's George Brett hit 24 homers and
struck out only 22 times. ... Giants slugger Barry Bonds hit his
391st home run, putting him 29th on the all-time list. Next to pass
is Dale Murphy, at 398. ... There hasn't been a 20-game loser since
Brian Kingman for Oakland in 1980, but Arizona's Willie Blair is
headed that way. Going into the weekend, Blair was 2-11.

TEXAS FOOTBALL'S POPULARITY CAN BE FELT AT ITS INTERNET SITE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The story isn't new: Internet site with down-home appeal finds
transplanted souls yearning for a taste of back home.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the case with ``Dave Campbell's Texas Football''.
</P>
<P>
   The annual magazine's international popularity has become a
pleasant yet costly surprise for its producer, Host Communications
of Dallas. It all started when the online version of ``Texas
Football'' (www.texasfootball.com) began accepting orders for the
352-page print magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Publisher Dave Stephenson said it has always been evident that
transplanted Texans who follow college and high school football in
Texas have wanted a way to order the magazine online.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, Stephenson had no idea how many would take advantage
or from where they would be ordering.
</P>
<P>
   As such, ``Texas Football'' has had to reconfigure its online
system to accommodate domestic and international orders. And
shipping the magazine around the world is going beyond the quoted
$3 first-class charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're biting the bullet,'' Stephenson said. ``We're
charging $3 for first-class mailing when it's costing us $20.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who want to peruse ``Texas Football'' for free on the
Internet, be warned that the online version doesn't have all of the
content for which the 39-year-old magazine is known. But it does
have enough to make it a worthy companion publication.
</P>
<P>
   New online features at ``Texas Football'' include cover choices
(featuring Texas or Texas A&AMP;M) for online magazine buyers and a
collection of links to high schools with Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas Football'' online also includes news about
football-related events in Texas, a chat area, schedules for every
high school and back issues. During the season, the site will
compile statistics and standings of the state's high school
football teams, Stephenson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect it to be a huge undertaking,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson said his company gets several calls from readers
wanting the entire magazine to be online.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could transfer things over pretty simply, but we only want
portions of it on there, like the Super Team and the Texas Top
300,'' he said. ``When we run out of room \Rin the magazine\S, we
want the Web site to always be an extension you can go to.''
</P>
<P>
   Being online means immediate feedback, Stephenson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear our share of criticism and get a bunch of critiques,''
he said. ``The magazine has such a tradition, the community gets a
feeling of ownership, and they tell you what they like or don't
like.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing about the Internet, there's someone out there who
always wants a little more.''

GENTLEMEN NOT USED TO UNDERDOG ROLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  INGLEWOOD _ The (begin ital)other(end ital) horse in the
Hollywood Gold Cup today is the defending champion, the one whose
trainer has won the past six runnings of the major Southern
California races for older thoroughbreds, the one whose jockey is
the latest Hall of Fame inductee, and the one whose owner runs the
track.
</P>
<P>
   Gentlemen doesn't fit the usual description of an underdog, even
if he and entrymate Puerto Madero are 7-5 second choices behind
even-money Skip Away on the morning line for the eight-horse Gold
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't just enter (Gentlemen) so I'd have a seat up in the
Director's Room,'' trainer Richard Mandella said on the eve of the
$1 million race.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away flew here from his New York base this week with a No.
1 ranking and a six-race winning streak in his suitcase. Although
East-to-West shippers traditionally struggle, Skip Away has made
this trip with success before, winning the Breeders' Cup Classic at
Hollywood Park last November.
</P>
<P>
   But Gentlemen has a few things going for him:
</P>
<P>
   _Gentlemen is at least the equal of Skip Away on their best day.
He won their only meeting, the 1997 Pimlico Special in Baltimore,
by half a length while carrying three more pounds. Everybody
carries 124 today.
</P>
<P>
   _Mandella can do no wrong in the Gold Cup, the Santa Anita
Handicap and Del Mar's Pacific Classic. The trainer's six straight
victories include Dare and Go's upset of Cigar, two wins by
Gentlemen and a pair of 1-2-3 finishes.
</P>
<P>
   _Jockey Gary Stevens is bent on taking the Eclipse Award away
from Skip Away's East Coast-based rider Jerry Bailey, who won it
the past three years. Having recently decided not to spend the rest
of the year in the East, accepting an offer to ride first call on
Bob Baffert's powerful stable here, Stevens will be eager to
upstage Bailey in a nationally televised intersectional showdown.
</P>
<P>
   As for the fact Gentlemen owner R.D. Hubbard is the Hollywood
Park chairman, that shouldn't really be an advantage for the horse.
Still, Hubbard had his usual swagger at the ceremony where post
positions were drawn Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to tell you,'' he said to Carolyn and Sonny Hine, Skip
Away's owner and trainer, ``what's going to happen to you Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gentlemen hasn't raced since suffering from respiratory
bleeding and finishing last in the March 7 Big 'Cap. Skip Away has
won twice since then.
</P>
<P>
   Can Gentlemen fire his best shot after a 3{-month layoff?
Actually, with Mandella training, he'll be expected to.
Horse-watchers who saw Gentlemen this week said he looks
tremendous.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Mandella) is a good horseman, he pays attention to
details,'' Sonny Hine said this week. ``That's why I worry about
Gentlemen.''

HITCHCOCK STOPS ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Hitchcock was so good, it was scary.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego Padres pitcher Sterling Hitchcock took a no-hitter
into the eighth inning Saturday afternoon before the Angels' Phil
Nevin homered leading off the inning to spoil the no-hit bid. But
it didn't stop the Padres from beating the Angels for the second
day in a row 5-1 before 31,948 at Qualcomm Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was the Angels' second in a row, marking the first time
they have lost back-to-back games in a month _ they lost May 25 and
27 to the Royals. The Padres have won 16 of 19.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the loss, the Angels maintained their 1{-game lead in
the AL West over Texas. San Diego remained 6{ games ahead of San
Francisco in the NL West.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock (4-1) finished with a complete-game two-hitter,
striking out nine and walking one. The Angels' only other hit was
an infield hit by Damon Mashore that could have been ruled an error
when Hitchcock failed to pick up a roller in front of the mound.
</P>
<P>
   The closest the Angels came to a hit through seven innings came
on Dave Hollins' low liner toward shortstop Chris Gomez in the
fourth inning. Gomez backhanded the ball on a shorthop, then began
a 6-4-3 double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he missed a spot all day,'' Nevin said. ``He
pitched to his spots, and he didn't throw many balls right down the
middle.
</P>
<P>
   Nevin actually broke his bat on the home run, hitting a
curveball _ Hitchcock's only mistake of the afternoon and his first
pitch of the eighth inning _ over the fence in left.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the kind of guy today you didn't want to fall behind
(in the count),'' Nevin said. ``I wouldn't say I was looking for a
curveball, but he left it up in the zone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had thrown some curveballs over the plate for first-pitch
strikes, and I tried to get it over,'' Hitchcock said. ``I hung it,
and that's where hanging curveballs go.''
</P>
<P>
   Possibly a big part of the Angels' inability to hit Hitchcock
was their scouting report. Angels manager Terry Collins said
Hitchcock had a good changeup working, but Hitchcock said he only
threw one changeup all day.
</P>
<P>
   That was his splitter the Angels struggled with, and Collins
said there was no mention of a splitter in their report on
Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly with (pitching coach) Dave Stewart over there, some
guys are going to have it I'm sure,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   After Nevin's homer in the eighth, the Angels put runners on
first and second with one out on Mashore's single and an error by
Gomez at shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   But Gomez made up for it by fielding Paco Martin's chopper up
the middle, stepping on second and throwing to first for the
inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels got a decent performance from starter Omar Olivares
(5-3), who stayed close until the later innings. With a 1-0 lead in
the sixth, the Padres had a couple of seeing-eye groundballs find
holes in the infield on their way to a two-run inning. They scored
another run off Olivares in the seventh when Tony Gwynn rolled one
down the right-field line for an RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt real good. I felt I was doing everything right,
Olivares said. ``A couple of groundballs got through the infield.
It's part of the game. There's nothing I can do about that. I was
happy with the way I pitched.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hitchcock was that much better.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you only get two hits, it's pretty hard to say anything
about anything else, except the guy pitched a good ballgame,''
Collins said. ``Certainly we didn't play the way we've been
playing. One thing we've done during the month is spread out our
offense. Today, we didn't get anything from anybody.''

ASSEMBLY VOTE REALIGNS NORTHERN IRELAND LOYALISTS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs with final vote results)   By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ New alliances emerged on Saturday in
the aftermath of the election to the Northern Ireland Assembly,
with the British province's largest Catholic and Protestant parties
turning away from old divisions to unite in support of the fragile
peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The vote produced a clear endorsement of the new assembly, the
centerpiece of the peace settlement reached on April 10. But it
also laid bare a strong challenge from within the Protestant
movement to one of its key players, David Trimble, head of the
Ulster Unionist Party and the presumed speaker of the new body.
Many members of his party deserted him and voted for candidates
opposed to sharing power with Catholics in the new legislature.
</P>
<P>
   John Hume, leader of the moderate Catholic Social Democratic and
Labor Party, rushed in on Saturday to try to shore up support for
Trimble.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this election,'' he said, ``it is quite clear that David
Trimble and his party have done very, very well indeed. And when
you add up his votes and the SDLP vote and the votes of the parties
that are in favor of the agreement, it's very strong and very clear
and therefore the circumstances for working together now are
certainly a lot better than they looked, given the noise of the
`no' campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Alban Maginness, another Social Democratic and Labor Party
winner and the first Catholic ever to be lord mayor of Belfast,
appeared on a television panel with Trimble on Saturday morning and
said: ``We want to see a new type of politics in Northern Ireland,
the politics of cooperation, and I think the Ulster Unionists agree
with that type of approach.''
</P>
<P>
   With the ballot count from Thursday's election finishing on
Saturday evening, the final totals showed 28 seats for Trimble's
party; 24 for Hume's; 20 for the anti-agreement Democratic
Unionists of the Rev. Ian Paisley; 18 for Sinn Fein, the Irish
Republican Army's political wing headed by Gerry Adams; 6 for the
cross-community Alliance Party; 5 for the UK Unionists of Robert
McCartney, a Paisley ally; and 7 for other, smaller parties.
</P>
<P>
   In the most critical measure of the new divide that seems to
have replaced the sectarian schism in Northern Irish politics, 80
of the winners were supporters of the peace accord and 28 were
opponents. That figure was 2 shy of the number Paisley and his
followers needed to carry out their threat to block steps in the
assembly called for in the peace accord, though it insured what
Trimble called ``a bumpy ride.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, the product of 26 months of negotiations in
Belfast, sets up a number of councils intended to balance opposing
desires: the Catholics' wishes to form a closer association with
the Republic of Ireland, and the Protestants' to remain part of
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-agreement campaign, led by the firebrand Paisley and
aided by dissidents within Trimble's party, made significant
inroads into his support.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Northern Ireland have written the obituary
notice of Trimbleism,'' Paisley exulted after the vote. ``I believe
it is the end of his leadership of anything in Northern Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams, whose party increased its vote total from past elections,
said that he ``appreciated David Trimble's difficulties'' and that
he thought the fracturing of the Unionist vote was ``regrettable.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Trimble's longtime refusal to speak to him, Adams,
who will now become a minister in the new Northern Ireland
government, sounded conciliatory. Trimble, he said, ``has a place
on this island, and it should be an honorable place and an honored
place, and he has to accept that I have to be treated on the basis
of equality.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the winners were men who once committed acts of sectarian
violence but have since become some of the most passionate backers
of a negotiated peace. They included Gerry Kelly, the man convicted
in an IRA bombing of a London court building that killed 1 person
and injured 250. There were also the leaders of the Progressive
Unionist Party: Billy Hutchinson, a former Protestant paramilitary
gunman with two murder convictions; and David Ervine, who spent
five years in jail for possession of explosives.
</P>
<P>
   The first meeting of the assembly is to take place Wednesday in
the same conference hall where peace negotiations held. The
principal order of business will be to select a first minister,
most likely Trimble, and his deputy, probably Hume.
</P>
<P>
   There will be discussion on whether the assembly should make its
permanent home in the neoclassical Stormont Palace, which housed
the old legislature famously described by its first speaker in 1922
as ``a Protestant Parliament for a Protestant people.'' Catholics
have long associated that body, and its limestone building full of
heroic Unionist paintings and statuary, with Protestant domination
of the province.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, the assembly adjourns until the fall. It is
expected to receive its powers to legislate early in the new year.
</P>
<P>
   Before then it will form cross-border groups to bring together
ministers from the new Northern Ireland government with their
counterparts in the government of Ireland in Dublin. It is this
process that the anti-agreement campaigners have vowed to
frustrate. ``Anything in the assembly that is likely to lead us
closer to the Republic of Ireland we will block, we will vote
against and we will endeavor to stop,'' pledged Gregory Campbell,
Paisley's lieutenant in Londonderry.

HANDFUL OF ERRORS DOOMS RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Consider Rangers first baseman Will Clark armed
and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   None of the Rangers' season-high five errors appeared as
significant as the one Clark committed in the seventh inning of a
6-5 loss to the Giants in 10 innings yesterday at 3Com Park.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's errant throw _ the first of three seventh-inning errors
by the Rangers _ resulted in two unearned runs on an afternoon in
which defensive deficiencies opened the door for a game-winning
single by Giants center fielder Darryl Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a ballgame that we had every opportunity to win,''
Rangers manager Johnny Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers began the seventh inning with a 5-3 lead, but
Hamilton, who was 4-for-6 and scored twice, started the inning with
a single. Left-hander Eric Gunderson appeared to remedy that
situation with an apparent pickoff, but Clark's throw toward
shortstop Kevin Elster glanced off Hamilton's left shoulder and put
a runner in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sign of a decent pitcher is picking up your infielders
when they don't make a play,'' Gunderson said.
</P>
<P>
   The failure to record an out proved costly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It changed the whole complexion of the inning,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Gunderson surrendered consecutive two-out, run-scoring singles
to right fielder Stan Javier and third baseman Bill Mueller, who
sent home first baseman J.T. Snow with the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough play for Will,'' Oates said, referring to Clark's
sore left elbow.
</P>
<P>
   However, Clark also has a below-average arm for a major-league
first baseman, and that is often apparent. Clark, though, said his
arm did not play a role on the error.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said Hamilton, whom he called a ``veteran runner,'' ran
out of the baseline and into the infield grass to thwart his throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw the ball right where I wanted, and he ran right over
into the middle of it, but that's not what cost us the game,''
Clark said. ``They got a bunch of two-out base hits.''
</P>
<P>
   Television replays and Elster suggested otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was within a foot of the baseline,'' Elster said of
Hamilton. ``He came inside, but he didn't come way inside. Will
made a nice throw in a gusty wind, but it was just one of those
things that happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Those things happened often yesterday for the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   A first-inning throwing error by third baseman Fernando Tatis
hit Hamilton in the back before he crossed the plate with the
Giants' first run, and center fielder Roberto Kelly fumbled
seventh-inning singles by Javier and Mueller. Kelly's misplays
allowed runners to advance an extra base.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Luis Alicea, who replaced Tatis as a pinch hitter
in the ninth inning, committed the fifth and final error, which led
to the winning run.
</P>
<P>
   Alicea missed a one-out ground ball off the bat of catcher Brian
Johnson. The ball went under the glove of Alicea, who played the
ball to his left side, resulting in a two-base error.
</P>
<P>
   Giants left-hander Shawn Estes replaced Johnson as a pinch
runner and scored the winning run from second base on Hamilton's
single off right-hander Danny Patterson. It was the Giants' fourth
unearned run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't our best ballgame of the year,'' Oates said.

THERE'S NO ROOM FOR WATSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Pitcher Allen Watson, who had a strained flexor
muscle in his left elbow, has proclaimed himself ready to rejoin
the rotation. The only problem for the lefty is there is no spot
available for him.
</P>
<P>
   Watson has made three rehab starts and will be activated next
week, but since the Angels starters _ primarily Jarrod Washburn and
Steve Sparks _ have done so well as fill-ins, Angels manager Terry
Collins might be reluctant to make changes.
</P>
<P>
   Watson said if that's what Collins wants, he'll pitch in the
bullpen _ for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys are doing well, I don't want to disturb the team,''
Watson said. ``If they need me before the (All-Star) break in the
bullpen, I want to do what's best for the team. But I don't want to
be in the bullpen for the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys filling in have done a great job, but I'm not going
to root against them. I'm not hoping someone gets hurt. That's not
my style. But when I'm healthy, I win. If I don't play here, I'll
play somewhere else. My main goal is to be healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson had good numbers in his rehab start Friday for Triple-A
Vancouver _ 6 IP, 3 R, 6 H, 8 K, 2 BB _ but the number that stood
out to Collins and his staff was 98.
</P>
<P>
   That was the number of pitches Watson threw, which exceeded the
limit of 90 the club had set for him going in. But Watson felt fine
Saturday and said he's feeling the best he's felt in a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is I could throw my breaking pitches. It's something
I couldn't do the whole year,'' he said. ``I went back to my old
mechanics. Everything felt strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Tough calls: In Friday night's game against the Padres, the
Angels struck out 12 times, nine of them coming on called-third
strikes by plate umpire Angel Hernandez. Was Hernandez a bit
liberal with the strike zone? Collins wouldn't say.
</P>
<P>
   But Collins did say that any time an American League team plays
with National League umps, and vice versa, figuring out the strike
zone can be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``After being in this league a couple of years, I can tell you
that every umpire's different,'' Collins said. ``When you're not
familiar with them, it makes it hard to know what you're approach
is going to be. We didn't know (Hernandez). When we're playing in
the AL, we know what we have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Padres starter Sterling Hitchcock had nine strikeouts Saturday,
but only three were called.
</P>
<P>
   ``The National League strike zone is a little bigger, it's not a
secret,'' Angels catcher Phil Nevin said. ``If our guy gets those
pitches, that's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Extra innings: The Padres Tony Gwynn was 1 for 20 lifetime
against Angels starter Omar Olivares going into Saturday's game,
but he went 2 for 4 on Saturday.... The Padres have never had a
no-hitter in club history, although Hitchcock has thrown one. In
1990, Hitchcock threw a no-hitter for the Single-A Greensboro
Hornets in the South Atlantic League.

   BLYTHE, Calif. _ Two sides of the immigration issue clashed in
this small desert town Saturday as flag-waving protesters against
illegal immigration vowed to resurrect a controversial billboard
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The leased billboard, removed earlier this week from Interstate

state. Don't let this happen to your state.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are here to take over your country,'' warned

Cali fornia-based group supporting the billboard, speaking at a
news con ference earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters, some who had traveled from as far as Maryland
and Florida, said they would erect identical billboards in other
states, including Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   At a highway overpass near the site where the sign had
previously stood, the protesters held up what was intended to be a
replica of the billboard.
</P>
<P>
   Because of copying problems at a Kinko's shop in Southern
California, which the group claims sabotaged its efforts, only a
portion of the message was displayed.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 50-odd protesters had left the scene by the time a
handful of counterprotesters arrived. &UR; The few that remained taunted
the sign's opponents, but more than three dozen police officers
kept the peace. Nearly 20 officers formed a human barricade around
the sign's opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immigrants have the highest level of productivity,'' said
Josie Montoya, a member of the Orange County, Calif., chapter of
the League of United Latin American Citizens. `It's a myth that
they're a drain on society.`
</P>
<P>
   The theme of many of those rallying against illegal immigration
can be summed up in one word: invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer asserted that the Mexi can government, aided by sympa
thetic Mexican-American leaders in the United States, were using
immigration to orchestrate a re conquista (reconquering) of the
former Mexican territory known as the American Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Barbra Coe, a leader of the California Coalition for Immigra
tion Reform, which had leased the billboard, said, ``Our message
is: Wake up America! And protect yourself from the malignancy &UR; that
is slowly but surely destroying its host.''
</P>
<P>
   Coe also singled out Mario Obledo, a Sacramento lawyer and
veteran of the Hispanic civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to protest a terror ist act by someone who we
believe to be an anti-American race activ ist,'' said Coe,
referring to Obledo.
</P>
<P>
   Obledo had called the sign ``racist and divisive'' and weeks ago
promised to deface it and confront Coe and her group in Blythe on
Saturday. But he never showed up.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who did show up to protest the billboard was Ro
dolfo Pinon, who watched the events with his 12 year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm giving my son a lesson in racism,'' Pinon said.
</P>
<P>
   The billboard company, Califor nia-based Martin Media of Paso
Robles, Calif., removed the sign Tuesday. It had been up since May
7.
</P>
<P>
   Martin representatives denied that they were taking sides in the
dispute and said that they were simply protecting their property.
</P>
<P>
   They also denied that the re moval was influenced by their
recent acquisition by a much larger communications company in a
multimillion-dollar buyout.
</P>
<P>
   Coalition supporters defended the billboard and warned those in
other states &UR; to heed its message.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sign is factually correct,'' said Marshall Gilbert, a Palm
Springs radio talk-show host. Gil bert said that, since the
billboard controversy erupted, &UR; his listeners have wanted to talk
about little else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's saying: `We're a bunch of suckers, don't let this happen
to you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert, broadcasting live from the protest, said that what con
cerned &UR; his listeners most was that Obledo's threat to deface the
sign had interfered &UR; with free speech, which he said could have a
ripple effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it happened here, then Arizona will be next.''
</P>
<P>
   Though many protesters came from California, some traveled much
longer &UR; distances to rally in defense of the billboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this was an impor tant thing to attend,'' said
Sheldon Isaacs of &UR; Baltimore, Md., who flew in for the protest,
after learning of the billboard &UR; and its removal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support immigration but so many of the new immigrants are
being taught to hate the country and becoming a burden on it.''
</P>
<P>
   But a few miles away, where 20 or so Hispanic activists debated
whether to confront billboard sup porters, some of them disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   One insisted there was no dif ference between those immigrating
to the United States today and past immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcomed those on the Mayflower, and we fed them,'' said
Jessica Castro, president of LU LAC's Orange County chapter. ``They
stayed and they &UR; multi plied.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro added, ``Immigration is a wonderful thing and something
that the country was founded &UR; upon.''
</P>
<P>
   At day's end, as the California protesters boarded a charter bus
headed back &UR; to the Los Angeles area, one offered some advice to his
neighbors to the east.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arizona seems unaffected by all this right now,'' said Tom
Morpheu of San Pedro, Calif. Morpheu estimated that the num ber of
illegal im migrants in California still far exceeds those in
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if they get anywhere near the numbers that are in
California, then the folks there had better know what they're
getting into,'' he said. &QL;

CLINTONS ATTEND CHURCH  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ On Sunday morning, president and Mrs. Clinton attended
services at Chongwenmen Church, the largest officially-sanctioned
church in Beijing, with nearly 3,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   The congregation presented Clinton with a bilingual Bible and
invited him to speak to the overflow crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``We celebrate with you the growth of the practice of our faith
in China,'' Clinton said in remarks that lasted less than five
minutes. ``I believe our faith calls upon us to seek unity with
people across the world with different backgrounds and races and
creeds.''
</P>
<P>
   The president added: ``I believe Chinese and Americans are
brothers and sisters as children of God. We come here in that
spirit today.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's schedule for Sunday included a tour of the
Forbidden City palace in Beijing and a trip to the Great Wall. In
the evening, Clinton and Jiang were to hold a private dinner at the
Zhongnanhai government compound.

HOME VIDEO INDUSTRY NO LONGER REELING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The death of the home video business, Hollywood's
most reliable profit source for the past decade, is no longer
imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Though it carries a far lower profile than the theatrical
business, home video reaches 50,000 outlets and generates three
times as much revenue, not to mention the $15 billion or so it
generates overseas. That revenue has become the salvation of
studios coping with soaring production costs.
</P>
<P>
   So naturally alarms went off last year when the business hit an
iceberg of consumer resistance.
</P>
<P>
   The Blockbuster chain, its nation-leading 6,000 stores built on
the backs of videocassettes, was mired in red ink. Rivals were
closing stores. The overall industry muddled through an
unprecedented slowdown, winding up with the first year-to-year
decline -- a whopping 6.5 percent -- since videocassette recorders
appeared two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of people on Wall Street that were giving the
death knell to the industry last year because things like
video-on-demand would kill it,'' said Marvin Roffman of
Philadelphia-based Roffman Miller Associates. ``But it's probably
not going to die for a long time. Home video is still a very viable
business.''
</P>
<P>
   1997's decline broke down to a 3 percent fall in rental revenues
and a 10 percent slide in sales of tape. The decline in
sell-through was due partly to major retailers like Wal-Mart using
heavy discounts on tapes as ``loss leaders'' to lure more
customers, but speculation emerged that video was on its way out
and that VCRs eventually would go the way of eight-track tapes.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts believe those fears were overstated. And the
industry has responded effectively with old-fashioned gimmicks like
price cuts, more advertising and a focus on hit titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The growing popularity of pay-per-view, game machines and the
Internet all come out of a finite number of entertainment hours, so
home video has had to step up this year,'' said Thomas Adams,
president of Adams Media Research.
</P>
<P>
   Added Barbara McNamara, an analyst with Alexander &AMP; Associates:
``The $20 billion this industry takes in every year in the domestic
market is not going away overnight. The industry seems to have
recovered from its problems and is in a state of upswing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rentals are up 4 percent so far this year, according to
Alexander &AMP; Associates. Sales of tapes have slipped 2.5 percent but
should wind up rising this year because ``Titanic'' will hit store
shelves in September.
</P>
<P>
   McNamara said the biggest problem last year was a relatively
simple one: 1997 titles were not as interesting as those in 1996.
That situation worsened when the studios back-loaded the schedule
for the holiday shopping season, meaning long stretches of time for
customers without any new product resembling a hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the problems were from poor product flow, and they've
managed to avoid that this year,'' McNamara said.
</P>
<P>
   Solid performers thus far include ``As Good as It Gets,''
``Mouse Hunt,'' ``Red Corner,'' ``The Rainmaker,'' ``Flubber'' and
``Face/Off.'' Besides ``Titanic,'' prospects look good for ``Good
Will Hunting,'' ``Lost in Space,'' ``The X-Files,'' ``Godzilla''
and the direct-to-video sequel to Disney's ``The Lion King.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year's disastrous performance led to a massive
rearrangement in how retailers are doing business with studios and
wholesalers. Stores used to pay about $60 for a rental title, then
kept all the rental revenue; now the retailer gets a huge discount
on buying multiple copies of new videos in exchange for part of
rental revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Wholesale specialist Rentrak Corp. pioneered the revenue-sharing
idea through the Hollywood Video and Wherehouse chains. And
Blockbuster, after months of pleading with studios to cut prices
for rental tapes, began making similar deals with studios late last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have reported that Blockbuster's deal with Disney calls
for the studio to receive $7 or $8 per tape upfront plus 40 percent
of rental revenues for the first 26 weeks the tape is on shelves.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar move, 20th Century Fox recently started an ``easy
lease'' program, under which retailers can obtain additional copies
of a popular title at a discount and then ship them back to the
studio rather than trying to sell the used tapes.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement has allowed major chains to focus on ``copy
depth,'' so a store might now stock as many as 120 copies of a
single movie rather than the 40 or 50 it would have had a year ago.
Blockbuster has started giving customers a voucher for a free
rental if a ``guaranteed'' major new title, such as ``Scream 2'' or
``As Good as It Gets,'' is out of stock.
</P>
<P>
   The new financing deals also mean studios for the first time are
spending significant money on promotion of rental titles, rather
than leaving that task to the chains. MGM fired up a massive
campaign in mid-May for ``Tomorrow Never Dies'' in connection with
the final episode of ``Seinfeld.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Studios that are doing aggressive marketing for rentals have
been doing very well,'' said Patricia Wyatt, president of Fox Home
Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing very encouraging signs of rental transactions
being up from last year,'' said David Bishop, president of MGM Home
Entertainment. ``The key benefit in revenue sharing is that for the
first time in our history our economic results are aligned with
retailers. So you'll see a lot more advertising after the release
date.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Eves, president of the Video Software Dealers
Association trade group, said the changes are the most profound in
the two-decade history of the video business, turning it into much
more of a partnership with studios.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a plethora of new programs to put more copies into
stores, and that means the customer complaint about not finding
what they want is becoming a thing of the past,'' he said. ``It's
been a real shot in the arm.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Nowhere has the strategy worked better than at Blockbuster,
which had been widely viewed as being on life support a year ago
after Viacom took a $203 million charge for excess inventory and
store closures.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom paid $8.4 billion for Blockbuster in 1994 with the idea
that the chain would generate the cash needed for Viacom's other
operations like Paramount Studios and MTV. Instead, competition
from cable and bargain-basement retailers cut profits and problems
accelerated when former Wal-Mart executive Bill Fields decided to
turn Blockbuster stores into ``neighborhood entertainment centers''
with books and T-shirts rather than focusing on video rentals.
</P>
<P>
   By last summer, Blockbuster was performing so poorly that one
analyst said it had ``zero value'' within Viacom stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were seriously worried about Blockbuster,'' said Michael
Karaffa, New Line's executive vice president of home video. ``I'm
not saying that as Blockbuster goes, so goes the industry. But
there was a lot of concern. And now, they've really turned the
business on its ear.''
</P>
<P>
   Blockbuster, run for the past year by former Taco Bell executive
John Antioco, has proclaimed its problems are over and that it can
increase market share from 25 percent all the way to 40 percent.
