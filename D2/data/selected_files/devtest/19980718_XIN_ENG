<HEADLINE> WHO Calls for Worldwide Use of Global Solar UV Index </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
has urged the international community to use the Global Solar UV
Index as summer temperatures in many countries of the Northern
Hemisphere have been reaching their peak.
</P>
<P>
Long time exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, of which the
sun is the principal source, will have adverse health effects on
people, said WHO in a press release here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Over UV exposure could result in various skin cancers,
accelerated skin ageing, cataract and other eye diseases. It may
also adversely affect people's ability to resist infectious
diseases, and compromises the effectiveness of vaccination
programs.
</P>
<P>
But different UV indices are now being used worldwide, often
making people confused, WHO said. What's more, some local
authorities are unaware of the standardized and internationally
accepted Global Solar UV Index.
</P>
<P>
The Global Solar UV Index is an estimate of the maximum skin
damaging UV measured over a period of 10 to 30 minutes at solar
noon on a given day. The higher the UV Index, the greater the
exposure to skin and eye damaging UV and the less time it takes
for this damage to occur.
</P>
<P>
The Global Solar UV Index was introduced in 1995 by WHO, the
World Meteorological organization (WMO), the United Nations
Environment Program (UNEP) and the International Commission on
Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP).
</P>
<P>
The international organizations recommended national
governments to use the Global Solar UV Index as part of their
public awareness and educational programs. They also encouraged
the news media to use the index in their daily weather reports so
that the information they provide could be universally understood.

<HEADLINE> Assad Promises Syria Will Join New Peace Initiatives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
promised Friday that Syria would join future Middle East peace
initiatives that meet the country's fundamental requests.
</P>
<P>
"If there is an action for peace, Syria will be there," Assad
said after his second meeting with French President Jacques Chirac
at the Elysee presidential palace since arriving here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"If there are new initiatives which merit that we care about
them, we will care about them but on the condition that they
should be in agreement with our fundamental demands," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We hold to our principles," said the Syrian leader.
</P>
<P>
Assad described the talks with his French counterpart as
excellent, saying there were serious efforts by France and others
to relaunch the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
On the Franco-Egyptian proposal for an international conference
on the Middle East, he said there is nothing new in it, but Syria
will consider joining "when the appropriate circumstances exist."
</P>
<P>
On his part, Chirac, who gave a high-profile reception to Assad
on the first tour to a western country in 22 years, promised that
France would never allow the Middle East peace process collapse.
</P>
<P>
Chirac invited Damascus to join French efforts to attain the
objective of "a pacified Middle East, oriented toward the future
for its development in calmness and security for all."
</P>
<P>
He demanded a clarification of the whereabout of Alois Brunner,
a Nazi German criminal held responsible for the death of tens of
thousands of Jews in Nazi concentration camps during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Assad promised that he would examine the demand to make clear
whether Brunner was hiding in Syria.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Russia Urge Nuclear-Free Zone in Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Russia Friday urge all
countries concerned to take "practical and urgent measures" to
establish a zone free of nuclear arms in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The call was issued in a joint communique released here after
two day talks between Iran and Russia on nuclear weapons,
the Iranian official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
In the communique, the two countries acknowledged that the
proliferation of nuclear arms and other weapons of mass
destruction constituted threat to international peace and
security.
</P>
<P>
It said that the establishment of the nuclear-weapon-free
zones, particularly in the Middle East, should be encouraged as a
top priority.
</P>
<P>
The two sides demand the U.N. and other international
organizations, including the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA), play a vital role in creating such zones.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East
region would considerably strengthen peace and security both at
both regional and international levels.
</P>
<P>
Expressing concern over the existing nuclear facilities in the
Middle East, the two sides urged all regional countries, prior to
the establishment of a nuclear-free zone, to show thorough
restraint and not to develop, produce, or test nuclear devices.
</P>
<P>
The communique called for the earliest possible accession to
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) of all states that
have not signed it, particularly the countries in possession of
nuclear facilities not subject to the IAEA safeguards.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tehran and Moscow reaffirmed the inalienable right
of states to acquire and develop nuclear energy for peaceful
purpose, saying peaceful use of nuclear energy by the NPT states
under the IAEA control could not cause damage to any other country.
</P>
<P>
Russia expressed satisfaction with Iran's declaration that it
was committed to the regime of the non-proliferation of nuclear
weapons and had no intention of obtaining nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The joint communique was apparently aimed at allying the fear
among some countries, including the U.S. and Israel, that Iran is
striving to acquire nuclear weapons and long-range missiles with
the Russian assistance.
</P>
<P>
Under the Israeli pressure, the U.S. Congress is considering to
impose sanctions against Russian companies reportedly involved in
transferring nuclear and missile technologies to Iran.

<HEADLINE> UK Foreign Secretary Cook on NATO Enlargement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said Friday that cautious enlargement of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) would enable the alliance to remain
"the military guarantor of peace" in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a House of Commons debate on a NATO decision to
admit Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic, Cook said: "The
rewards of a successful enlargement will be great, and great for
both existing and new members."
</P>
<P>
"The expansion of NATO is a logical response to the end of the
Cold War and the collapse of the Iron Curtain," Cook said, but
adding: "NATO should proceed at a pace which is consistent with
NATO absorbing its expanded membership."
</P>
<P>
"We would not do any service to those other countries which
aspire to join NATO if we were to expand so rapidly that NATO lost
its effectiveness as the military guarantor of peace on our
continent," he added.
</P>
<P>
Cook noted that Britain would contribute 110 million pounds
(about 180 million U.S. dollars) over a decade, dismissing media
speculation that NATO expansion would cost tens of billions
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The British House of Commons is expected to approve the NATO
enlargement treaty later Friday and a debate in the House of Lords
will also be required later this month before Britain formally
ratifies the expansion plan.
</P>
<P>
It was reported 12 of the 16 NATO member states have approved
the NATO expansion plan, leaving Britain, Turkey, the Netherlands
and Portugal to complete the ratification process.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Lowers Growth Rate for 1997-2002 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The National Planning Commission
(NPC) of Nepal has lowered the targeted growth rate of the 9th
Five Year Plan period (1997-2002) to 6 percent from the original
estimate of 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The commission said here Friday that the gross domestic product
(GDP) and the per capita income are expected to grow by 6 percent
and 3.6 percent respectively during the 9th plan period.
</P>
<P>
When the plan was implemented in July last year, experts
doubted the feasibility of the targeted growth rate of 6.5
percent, citing limited resources.
</P>
<P>
The NPC finally approved the plan document on July 3 last year
after discussions.
</P>
<P>
The plan outlines the country's 20-year long-term economic
development perspective and sets poverty alleviation as its sole
objective.
</P>
<P>
The NPC said in a press release that the number of people
living below the poverty line has come down to 42 percent at the
end of the 8th five-year plan, and is expected to decrease by
about 32 percent under the 9th plan and further down to 10 percent
in a 20-year period.
</P>
<P>
The 9th five-year plan has put more emphasis on the
implementation of a 20-year Agriculture Perspective Plan which
aims to boost the country's agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
The NPC said that during the 9th five-year period, the
agriculture sector, the mainstay of the economy, is expected to
grow by 4 percent and other sectors by 7.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Rural and agriculture roads, irrigation, rural electrification
and agriculture technology are given priority in the plan.
</P>
<P>
Attention is also given to education, health, drinking water,
the social sector and industrialization, the NPC said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 373 billion rupees (5.7 billion U.S. dollars) will
be invested during the 9th plan period and the total development
expenditure is expected to be about 190 billion rupees (2.9
billion dollars), the NPC said.
</P>
<P>
It said that about 2.1 million people will get job
opportunities, and the unemployment rate will be brought down from
the present 4.9 percent to 4 percent by the end of the plan
period.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A workshop will be organized
here on July 19-21 on how to improve the implementation of the
projects in Nepal assisted by the Asian Development Bank (ADB),
the bank said in a press release Friday.
</P>
<P>
Government officials from Nepali ministries and project staff
from the 24 ongoing ADB-assisted projects in Nepal will gather
together to discuss current government procedures and practices in
various aspects of project implementation.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they will identify major constraints and issues
affecting the implementation of development projects, the bank
said.
</P>
<P>
While the implementation of ADB-assisted projects in Nepal has
improved significantly in recent years, a number of projects
continue to face implementation delays in recruitment of
consultants, award of contracts and execution of civil works and
overall slow decision-making process, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the forthcoming workshop is part of the technical
assistance project of 65,000 U.S. dollars approved by ADB in early
March, and the project aims to assist the Nepali government in
enhancing its capacity to improve project implementation.
</P>
<P>
Another workshop for senior government officials is scheduled
for September to further discuss and consider the findings of the
first workshop, including the proposed measures for addressing key
project implementation issues, the ADB added.

MOSCOW, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko praised Friday the State Duma for its constructive work
with the government-introduced stabilization law package.
</P>
<P>
But Kiriyenko was quoted by the Itar-Tass news agency as also
telling the lower house of parliament that the budget revenue
problem remains unsolved as not all of the laws were passed.
</P>
<P>
The submitted law package promised to build up the national
consolidated budget by an additional 102 billion rubles (about 17
billion U.S. dollars), including an extra 71 billion rubles (1.1
billion dollars) in revenues for the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko said the laws passed by the Duma are expected to
provide only 28.2 billion rubles (4.7 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
He hoped the Duma will meet with an understanding in the
perforce steps and do what can be done with presidential and
governmental decrees.
</P>
<P>
The government will be entitled to change tax rates on a
temporary basis, and there is no attempt of challenge or conflict,
said the premier.
</P>
<P>
The latest draft law on tax, he said, would allow the
government to change tax rates in a small scope -- up to 10
percent -- and send its decision to the State Duma.

<P>
BAGHDAD, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi satellite TV channel
started transmission Friday as part of the country's celebration
of the 30 year rule by the Baath party.
</P>
<P>
The Baath Party came to power in the July 17-30 Revolution in
1968.
</P>
<P>
Marking the satellite TV channel's launch, Minister of Culture
and Information Hummam Abdul-Khaliq said this TV project was
completed within a short period and under hard conditions due to the
U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the channel through its daily three-hour
broadcast would "convey to the world's peace-loving people a clear
image of Iraq's centuries-old civilization and the negative impact
of the eight-year sanctions."
</P>
<P>
The TV telecast from 10 a.m. local time (0600GMT) every day now
covers all Arab countries and is expected to reach West Europe
later the year, said the minister.

<HEADLINE> Germany's Trade Surplus on Course to New Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Thanks to booming exports, Germany's
trade surplus widened to 56.7 billion marks (31.7 billion U.S.
dollars) in the first five months of this year, paving the way for
an all-time high surplus for the whole year, according to official
data released Friday.
</P>
<P>
The latest trade data released by the German Federal Statistics
Office show Germany's exports grew by 14 percent to a total of
396.1 billion marks (221.3 billion dollars) in the first months
while imports grew only by 10.1 percent to 339.4 billion marks
(189.6 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The positive development of trade in visible goods helped to
drive down Germany's current account deficit, which also measures
trade in services, to just 1.9 billion marks (1.1 billion dollars)
for the first five months from 11.2 billion marks (6.3 billion
dollars) a year ago.
</P>
<P>
A research institute of Germany's largest commercial bank, the
Deutsche Bank, predicted that for 1998 as a whole, Germany's trade
surplus could surge to 141 billion marks (78.8 billion dollars)
from 116.5 billion marks (65 billion dollars) of last year,
breaking the previous record of 134.6 billion marks (75.2 billion
dollars) registered in 1989.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Denies Aggression Against Yemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia denied Friday
launching any aggression against Yemeni territories, saying it is
abiding by the signed agreements between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The official Saudi Press Agency (SPA) quoted a top Saudi
official as saying that Saudi Arabia was committed to the 1934
Ta'ef Agreement and supplementary documents, as well as the
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The official was commenting on press reports that Yemeni
embassies abroad were circulating the allegation that Riyadh was
taking aggressive actions against Yemeni territories.
</P>
<P>
The SPA said the 1995 MOU called for forming committees
including a military committee to resolve their border disputes.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed official said the Saudi government "sees that any
border dispute can be solved via the joint committees and not
through suspicious statements which do not help reach solutions."
</P>
<P>
He added that the joint military committee between the two
countries was aimed to prevent unusual military movements on
common borders.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and Yemen have been locked in border disputes since
1934, but the tension was eased after the signing of the MOU in
1995. The two countries have since been conducting border
demarcation negotiations through the joint committees.
</P>
<P>
They held the last round of border talks in May after Saudi
Interior Minister Naif Bin Abdel Aziz sent a letter to his Yemeni
counterpart Hussain Moh'd Arab shortly after new Yemeni government
was formed.
</P>
<P>
In early June, Saudi Prince and Defense Minister Sultan Bin
Abdul-Aziz met visiting Yemeni Minister of Legal Affairs Abdullah
Ahmed Ghanim and Justice Minister Ismail Ahmed Al-Wazeer in the
Saudi port city of Jeddah. The two sides agreed to continue their
talks on the final demarcation of their borders.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Airways Pilots Call Off Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Airways pilots decided
Friday to call off a strike scheduled for next week and start
dialog with the company's management.
</P>
<P>
The airways' union leaders made the decision after a meeting
with Speaker of Cyprus' House of Representatives Spyros Kyprianou.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou, who is acting President during President Glafcos
Clerides' three-day private visit to Israel, has been mediating
between the sides in a bid to avert the strike.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou said the government would monitor the dialog process
and use its influence with the management and the pilots to make
the dialog fruitful.
</P>
<P>
The pilots, who have not enjoyed a pay hike since 1989, were
demanding higher salary and other benefits. They said Tuesday they
would stage a three-day strike from July 23 to 26.
</P>
<P>
The company management argued Thursday the airline suffered a
loss of 3.2 million Cyprus pounds (about 6.4 million U.S. dollars)
in 1997, while its pilots are among the best paid in the world.
</P>
<P>
The planned strike, announced when island have just entered its
prime tourist season, were set to have a grave negative impact on
tourism, Cyprus' main source of revenues.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Christos Stylianides Friday welcomed the
pilots' decision, saying the forthcoming dialog must lead to
positive results for the sake of the company.
</P>
<P>
He also said the government would support the company's
strategic plan aimed at reducing labor costs and sharpening its
competitiveness in the 21st century.

<HEADLINE> Rubin Meets Finance Leaders from E. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin held talks Friday with finance ministers and central
bank governors of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda on issues including
regional cooperation, debt relief and economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
His visit has been widely regarded as an indication of U.S.
seriousness at opening Africa's market and trying to shift its
policy from aid to trade with Africa, an idea highlighted by U.S.
President Bill Clinton's historic African tour in March.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique issued together with Rubin after hours
of talks, finance ministers Simeon Nyachae of Kenya, Daneil Yona
of Tanzania and Gerald Sendaula of Uganda, said the three members
of the East Africa Cooperation (EAC) "are determined to continue
to deepen the reform process as a top priority" partly for wooing
foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The communique announced that innovative debt relief programs
are being applied so as to support productive investments, reduce
poverty and unemployment in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Public debt remains a major impediment to economic progress,
constitutes a heavy financial burden and crowds out essential
expenditures in such vital areas like education, health, and
operations and maintenance of infrastructure," said the
communique.
</P>
<P>
The three EAC countries reaffirmed their commitment toward
foreign oriented policies that create supportive investment
climates and foster integration into the global economy.
</P>
<P>
They also proposed to hold a regional anti-money laundering
conference in efforts "to prevent this vice from taking root in
the region."
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the U.S. administration will encourage the American
business community to take advantage of the reforms already
undertaken and invest in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign investment is critical both for renewed economic
growth and international integration," Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, in a speech to the business circle of the region,
Rubin highlighted the importance of good governance and the fight
againt graft in the developing countries undergoing reform.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is the last leg of Rubin's five-nation African tour
which has brought him to Cote d'Ivoire, South Africa, Namibia and
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
"I've come to Kenya because Kenya is a regional economic
center, the largest economy in east Africa and an important and
historic ally of the United States," he said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Rubin, who arrived in Kenya Thursday night for a three-day
visit, is accompanied by a 30-strong delegation including
entrepreneurs, businessmen and World Bank and International
Monetary Fund officials. The trip is said to be the most
extensive one by a U.S. treasury chief to sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Kenyan Foreign Minister Bonaya Godana told
reporters that the Americans are keen on African markets because
of the fact that the continent has abundant resources.
</P>
<P>
"We are the ideal entry point for the American market to
penetrate the COMESA (Common Market of Eastern and Southern
Africa) unity of the markets," said Godana.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the U.S. was the sixth largest market for Kenya's
exports. Official data show that in 1996 Kenyan exports to the
U.S. were worth some 3.017 billion Shillings (about 51 million
U.S. Dollars), while imports reaching 8.802 billion Shillings
(149.2 million Dollars).

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, NATO Agree on Need of Disarmament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government said Friday
it has agreed with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
on the need of disarmament in the divided island of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, government spokesman
Christos Stylianides said Cyprus agreed with NATO Secretary
General Xavier Solana that "ways to reduce tension and armaments
have to be found."
</P>
<P>
But the most productive way to achieve this should be through
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides' proposal for demilitarization
of the island, he added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Washington, Solana has said that NATO was prepared
to monitor, if necessary, a no-fly zone over Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides said this was proof that there was international
interest and discussions over the demilitarization proposal put
forward by Greece, the traditional ally of the Greek Cypriots
living in the south.
</P>
<P>
Asked about possible breakthrough on the no-fly zone proposal,
the spokesman admitted that "the facts we have before us cannot be
considered as absolutely optimistic."
</P>
<P>
"However, we believe that there is yet time and scope to begin
substantial talks and take steps toward demilitarization, so that
any armaments in Cyprus would be unnecessary," he added.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides said U.S. State Department's Special Coordinator
for Cyprus Thomas Miller was due in Nicosia on July 24 to tackle
the current crisis and explore ways of resuming the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Talks to solve the Cyprus problem hit a snag last July after
the Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash walked out of a
U.N.-sponsored peace talks with Greek Cypriot leader Glafcos
Clerides to protest against a European Union decision to start
accession talks with the Clerides-led Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
The tension in the island, divided since 1974 after Turkish
troops took over the northern third following a pro-Greece coup,
has been escalating since early 1997 due to a controversial
missile deal.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus ordered a Russian-made anti-aircraft missile system in
January 1997 in a bid to bolster its defense against the
35,000-strong Turkish troops stationed in the northern third of
the island.
</P>
<P>
The missiles are scheduled to be deployed later this year, but
Turkey has vowed to strike the missile if deployed.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government has declared that the missile deal could
be cancelled only if progress is achieved in the peace talks or the
proposal for demilitarization is accepted by the other side.

<HEADLINE> New Drug Proved Effective to Treat Obesity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A new drug for obesity, which stops
fat being absorbed into the human body, could be the "first step
to defuse the timebomb of obesity", The Lancet medical journal
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The drug, Orlistat, is the first approved treatment for obesity
that is not an appetite suppressant. It works in the gut,
impairing the digestion of fat and hindering its passage into the
blood stream. With Orlistat, a third of the fat eaten is excreted.
</P>
<P>
Until now, the general complaint about medical treatment for
obesity, which doctors are calling an epidemic disease, is that
they simply have not worked.
</P>
<P>
However, trials by Swedish researchers published in The Lancet
showed that Orlistat greatly increases weight loss during a diet
and halves the amount regained afterwards.
</P>
<P>
The two-year trials of 700 people found that those taking
Orlistat lost nearly twice the amount of weight after a year and
regained less weight in the second year than those who were put on
a placebo pill.
</P>
<P>
Researchers welcomed Orlistat as a much-needed tool in the
fight against obesity, stressing the importance of finding
treatments for obesity and its related diseases in the future.
</P>
<P>
Obesity is becoming increasingly common and is now recognized
as a major health issue worldwide. In the UK, the overweight and
obese population increased almost 15 percent between 1980 and
1992. Similar increases have been recorded in other countries.

<HEADLINE> UK To Ban Dumping Oil Rigs At Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Britain announced Friday it would
impose a ban on the dumping of offshore oil rigs and platforms in
the North Sea.
</P>
<P>
Environment Minister Michael Meacher told reporters that
offshore installations would be brought back to land to be
disposed of.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated decommissioning costs of all the steel offshore
oil rigs and platforms would rise by 300 million pounds (480
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
North Sea offshore oil operators were not happy over the
decision. Peter May, director-general of the UK Offshore
Operators' Association said in an interview "We're disappointed."
</P>
<P>
"We believe the case by case approach that we've been
advocating offered the best opportunity to find the best
solution," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meacher said Britain would put the proposal to a meeting of
environment ministers being held in Portugal next week.

PARIS, July 17 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Friday called on Pakistan to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty (CTBT) rapidly, after Islamabad conducted six nuclear bomb
tests, said the Elysee presidential office.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with an envoy of the Pakistani government,
Yacoub Khan, Chirac recalled that France had condemned the nuclear
tests by Pakistan and India, but opposed the imposition of
economic sanctions on the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"The president expressed the wish that Pakistan could sign as
rapidly as possible the CTBT without matching it with conditions,
that it could join talks termed "cut off" on the stop of
production of fissile materials, that it make commitment not to go
ahead with the transfers of nuclear technology to other
countries," said presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna.
</P>

Chirac met on June 1 an envoy from the Indian government on a

<HEADLINE> Museveni Urges Closer African Coop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
Friday appealed for all African countries to try to work toward
closer cooperation both politically and economically.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal in a speech entitled "Toward a Closer
Cooperation in Africa" at the first national congress of the
ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM) which ended here Friday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Europe and Africa were almost at the same stage 300 years ago.
But they are widely different now in that the former represents
advance while the latter denotes backwardness.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Africa should strengthen economic integration and
political unification, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is therefore, clear that Africa does not guarantee its
security; and its influence and credibility is negligible
although its potential is great. This would change if there was a
union of African states," he said.
</P>
<P>
He listed Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi as the
most convenient countries that can start as a nucleus of the
African union because they use Swahili language to some degree
and have got a shared history.
</P>
<P>
Museveni also stressed regional trade cooperation as one of
ways to promote the economic development of the region and
eventually eradicate poverty.
</P>
<P>
As far as Uganda is concerned, he proposed that it should
trade with everybody in Africa who wishes to trade with it and
create the necessary infrastructural linkages in the form of
roads, railways, harbors so that it can actualize this wish to
trade together.
</P>
<P>
The conference delegates are advised to mobilize local people
by what they agree on at the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani Criticizes Islamic Countries Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran's former President Hashemi
Rafsanjani Friday criticized other Islamic countries for their
indifference toward Iran's call to confront Israel's Jerusalem
expansion plan.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a congregation of prayers on the campus of Tehran
University, Rafsanjani said that "many weeks" have elapsed with no
response from any other Muslim nation to the invitation made by
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami to hold an urgent conference on
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Khatami, also the current Chairman of the Organization of
Islamic Conference (OIC), urged last month the OIC member states
to hold an emergency foreign ministerial meeting to deal with
Israel's plan to expand the disputed holy city Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Despite international pressure, Israeli government on June 21
approved the plan to expand Jerusalem's boundaries by annexing
some Jewish suburbs as well as eight Jewish settlements in the
Palestinian territories of West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The plan was denounced by Islamic countries as a plot to
judaize Jerusalem by increasing the Jewish majority in the city,
which Israel seized from Jordan in 1967.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem, a city holy to Christians, Jews and Muslims, houses
the third holiest Islamic shrine, the Aksa Mosque.
</P>
<P>
Although Iran is not under the direct threat of "Israel's
state terrorism," Rafsanjani said, it considers the judaization of
Jerusalem as the most sensitive issue since it has a deep sense of
responsibility for the Muslim world.
</P>
<P>
Saying the 55-nation OIC was formed to protect Islamic
interests worldwide, the former president said it should not
remain indifferent to the destiny of the Palestinians in the face
of Israel's high-handed policies.

MOSCOW, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Russia Foreign Ministry stated on

Kosovo", its "state" institutions, including the "parliament",
according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a session of the "parliament of the Republic of
Kosovo" held on Thursday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir

agreement and resume talks to discuss all aspects of Kosovo
problems."

to the area.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Prods Israel to Adopt US Peace Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan Friday
pressed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to adopt a U.S.
proposal on reviving the Israeli-Palestinian talks, the official
Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
Answering a phone call from Netanyahu, Hassan told the Israeli
leader that it believed that "the U.S. initiative is a positive
step to push forward the Middle East peace process, especially on
the Israeli-Palestinian track."
</P>
<P>
He said Jordan was keen to see the crisis in the peace process
ended through implementing the U.S. proposal and the already
signed agreements between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He also assured Netanyahu that the Palestinians were committed
to the peace process and interested in overcoming the obstacles by
implementing the U.S. initiative.
</P>
<P>
During the phone conversation, Hassan briefed Netanyahu on
another phone call he received from Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In its proposal put forward since early this year, the
U.S. called on Israel to withdraw from 13.1 percent of the West
Bank in the second stage of redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has already endorsed the plan, but Israel has rejected
it citing that any redeployment exceeding 9 percent would endanger
its security.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made his telephone call to Hassan on Friday mainly to
inquire about the health of King Hussein, who is now in the
U.S. for a medical check. The king suffered high fever before he
left for the U.S. on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Govt Halts Bill over Teachers' Pay Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government announced
Friday it has decided to suspend the bill that would force
teachers to renegotiate their pay rise today when nationwide
teachers' strike entered the third and last day.
</P>
<P>
"The government has suspended to present the Teachers Service
Commission (Amendment) Bill to parliament," Education Minister
Kalonzo Musyoka was quoted by a Kenya Television Network (KTN)
evening news report as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
Following his announcement Friday evening, the 260,000-strong
Kenya National Union of Teachers called off the protest strike
starting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The union and the government reached agreement last year under
which the government promised to give teachers a 150-200 percent
pay rise over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
However, when announcing the 1998/99 (July/June) budget on
June 11, Finance Minister Simeon Nyachae said the government just
cannot afford to implement the deal, and asked the pay hike to be
renegotiated and new teachers recruitment to be frozen.
</P>
<P>
Carrying out the new teaches' salaries in 1998 will reportedly
take 30 percent of the total government revenue.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's economy is in a recession with real gross domestic
product shrinking in each of the first three months of 1998, and
high interest rates strangling private investment.

<HEADLINE> Iran Optimistic About POW Settlement With Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran express optimism Friday about
the final settlement of the issue of Prisoners of War (POW) with
Iraq soon, which was left over from the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
The name lists of POWs of the two countries have become clear
in recent talks between Iranian and Iraqi officials, Iran's POWs
Commission's chief Abdollah Najafi told the official news agency
IRNA in Kermanshah, western Iran.
</P>
<P>
Terming the negotiations held Wednesday at the border city of
Khosrawi as "constructive," Najafi said that with this goodwill
everything regarding the POWs would be fully clarified within a
few months.
</P>
<P>
The Khosrawi talks were held to implement the Memorandum of
Understanding on the POW issue signed last month in Baghdad by
Najafi and Iraqi officials.
</P>
<P>
Both sides promised to cooperate to bring about a quick and
final solution of the exchange of the POWs.
</P>
<P>
Tehran and Baghdad have recently sped up their efforts to solve
issues left from the war, particularly the repatriation of the
POWs, that have been impeding the normalization of their ties.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the Iran-Iraq war on July 18, 1988, 54,776
Iraqi and 39,364 Iranian POWs have been released.

likely to exceed 2.31 billion U.S. dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
Sultan said that the state company's cumulative profits since

</P>
<P>
He said KPC's strong performance over the past 18 years
has increased shareholders rights from 3.3 billion U.S. dollars
in 1980 to 21.42 billion U.S. dollars by the end of June
this year.

RABAT -- Official statistics revealed that the volume of

<HEADLINE> Chief Justice Rejects White House Request to Block </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Supreme Court Chief
Justice William Rehnquist Friday turned down the White House's
request to block Secret Service bodyguards from testifying in the
Monica Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
Rehnquist acted only a few minutes before the noon deadline set
for the Secret Service officers to arrive at the U.S. courthouse
several blocks away and testify behind closed doors before
independent counsel Kenneth Starr's grand jury.
</P>
<P>
"The opinion of the Court of Appeals seems to me cogent and
correct," Rehnquist wrote in the brief two-page order. The appeals
court ruled that President Bill Clinton's Secret Service guards
must testify about what they saw and heard while protecting the
president.
</P>
<P>
Rehnquist said the Clinton administration failed to show that
"irreparable harm" would result if the guards testified.
</P>
<P>
While Rehnquist rejected the administration's last-ditch
request to block temporarily the testimony, he said he assumed the
Supreme Court would agree to hear the administration's underlying
appeal seeking to create a new privilege shielding the guards from
having to testify.
</P>
<P>
Rehnquist, who just returned from a European teaching trip,
said that while he was not ruling on the administration request to
review the entire legal dispute, he assumed enough of his
colleagues might choose to take the case at a later date.
</P>
<P>
Justice Department spokesman Bert Brandenburg said the
department had no plans to exercise its right to ask other Supreme
Court justices for an emergency stay to block the testimony,
signaling the administration would simply wait to see if the high
court would settle the broader legal issue by accepting the case
this fall.
</P>
<P>
Rehnquist said he did not forward the question of the temporary
order to the full Supreme Court because many of the justices were
out of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Starr's grand jury is investigating possible encouragement
of perjury, witness tampering and obstruction in an alleged affair
between Clinton and former White House intern Lewinsky.

WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration has
sent a classified notice to Congress, asking it to approve the use
of secret contingency funds for cover operations within Iraq in an
attempt to weaken and possibly overthrow Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein, the Wall Street Journal said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The secret initiative "would go far beyond past efforts by the
CIA to encourage resistance inside Iraq," the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
It quoted unnamed government officials familiar with the
consultations between Congress and administration officials at the
State Department and the Pentagon as saying that the initiative
could involve U.S. military personnel and take more than a year of
organizing before fully undertaken.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration already has funds available to
pursue an open policy of support for Iraqi opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Congress approved 10 million dollars for this
purpose, including the establishment of a new Radio Free Iraq
program.
</P>

A recent State Department report to Congress outlines plans to
establish an Iraqi center in suburban London and to support future
conferences for the opposition in exile.

LUSAKA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Lusaka High Court Friday
ordered a military hospital here to conduct a medical exam on all
the 79 suspects involved in the October 28 failed coup last year
and give the court medical reports on each of them next month.
</P>
<P>
Judge Japhet Banda issued the order following an application

contracted illness in the cells and they need urgent medical
attention.

One of the suspects collapsed in the court while two others
were rushed to the military hospital after they complained of
feeling unwell, prompting the court to adjourn Friday afternoon.

<P>
Banda also ordered that five treason suspects who were being
kept in a cell should be removed because the cell is a "health
hazard".
</P>
<P>
Banda said he will visit the prisons during the course of
adjournment period to see for himself the conditions prevailing at
the Central Remand Prison and Kamwala Remand Prison.
</P>

medical attention so that trial can continue without being

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Earns $139m from Fish Exports in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania earned 139.1
million U.S. Dollars last year from selling abroad processed fish
netted in Lake Victoria, a ministser disclosed here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Natural Resources and Tourism Zakia Meghji told
parliament which is in session in central Dodoma that some 50,000
residents in the lake regions of Mara and Mwanza have been
employed in fish catching, processing and exporting.
</P>
<P>
"In order to increase the income of fishermen, the owners of
the processing industries give fishing gears to them in the form
of soft loans and they sell their fish to the industries in
return," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Meghji said the industries have provided local governments a
lot of revenue and managed to control malnutrition in the lake
region because of a great local fish consumption to provide
enough protein.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Meghji said Tanzania has planned to export fresh
fish products, mostly Nile Perch, to China, Japan and Australia
in a bid to lessen dependence on a volatile European Union (EU)
market.
</P>
<P>
She said the government appreciated the EU's lifting a
six-month ban on imports of fresh fish products from Tanzanian
for fear of being contaminated by cholera vibrio beginning on
July 1, but there was a need to reduce dependence on one market.
</P>
<P>
Businessmen identified China including Hong Kong, Japan and
Australia as the new potential market for the fresh fish products
during a meeting with fish processors in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The EU officially lifted the ban following recommendations
made by the European Commission Veterinary Committee, but
cautioning that consignments of fresh fish products must be
accompanied by health certificates before their entry into the EU
market.
</P>
<P>
The EU appointed the Fishery Division in Meghji's ministry as
the authority for the enforcement of the EU regulations on
hygienic conditions.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has sent 4,000 samples of fish to a Belgium
laboratory where tests proved that none of them were found with
cholera vibrio, the bacteria which causes cholera.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Grants Six-month Remission for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A special six-month
remission for all sentenced prisoners to mark South African
President Nelson Mandela's 80th birthday was announced on Friday,
South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
This would result in the release of about 9,000 prisoners from
next week, Correctional Services Minister Sipo Mzimela announced
in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
The 9,000 prisoners to be freed from Monday would be those who
had six months or less to serve in prison. Releasing all of them
would take about two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Mzimela said all sentenced inmates would benefit from the
remission, except the mentally disturbed and those who had
escaped and were still at large on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
An escaped prisoner surrendering before Saturday would still
qualify.
</P>
<P>
Unsentenced and awaiting-trial prisoners would not be eligible
for the remission.
</P>
<P>
Mzimela denied the move was in conflict with the government's
intention to stamp out crime. Instead, it was sending out a
positive message to prisoners, he said.
</P>
<P>
"While we are determined to root out crime, we don't want to
appear to use draconian measures," he said. "We also want to
encourage people to improve their behavior, knowing that at the
end of the tunnel there is some light."
</P>
<P>
Correctional Services Commissioner Khulekani Sitole said the
remission would ease the overpopulation of South African prisons,
which presently numbered 148,000.

JERUSALEM -- Ahead of the scheduled Israeli-Palestinian direct
talks, the Palestinians warned Israel not to maneuver to avoid
accepting the United States proposal for a 13.1 percent further
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Saturday in Ramallah following a weekly
cabinet meeting Friday night, the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) said that a "positive Israeli response" to the U.S.
proposal was the only solid basis for the resumption of direct
talks.
</P>
<P>
"Any talks short of such a response would be "nothing more than
a maneuver," it was quoted by Israel Radio as saying.

<P>
Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat has confirmed that
Deputy Chairman of the PNA Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) will meet
with Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai Sunday in Tel
Aviv.
</P>
<P>
The PNA statement reiterated that the U.S. should publicize

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Iran confirmed their
commitment of non-proliferation and share an idea of
creating a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East, the Russian
Foreign Ministry said in a press release on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Russian and Iranian foreign ministries
held consultations in Tehran on July 15-16 to discuss the problem
of disarmament, non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and export
controls, according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
The two sides emphasized the need for non-proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction and missiles for their delivery on
the global and regional scale, the Russian ministry said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the two countries after the consultations
adopted a joint statement on a nuclear-free zone in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that the creation of a nuclear-free zone in the
region would strengthen global peace and security both at the
international and regional levels.
</P>
<P>
The two sides proposed that the countries of the region should
refrain from developing, producing, testing and acquiring nuclear
weapons and from deploying them on their territory.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Moscow and Tehran confirmed the inalienable
right of all countries to acquire and develop atomic energy for
peaceful purposes.

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls Trial of Israeli Businessman Theatrical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Saturday denied that an
Israeli businessman had sold weapons-related material to Iran,
calling the trial of the businessman in Israel "a theatrical move."
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said the trial of
Nahum Manbar on charge of treason is a "political and judicial
conspiracy" aimed at raising doubts over Iran's anti-chemical
weapons policy.
</P>
<P>
In a much-hyped trial, an Israeli court Thursday sentenced
Manbar to 16 years in jail for alleged sale of material, equipment
and technical know-how to Iran for its chemical and biological
warfare program.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said the pressure put by Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu on the judge and defense lawyer "to politicize
the case indicated the main goal of Israel in staging such a show."
</P>
<P>
Iran follows seriously the policy to make the Middle East free
from weapons of mass destruction and is the vanguard in signing
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and opposing the
stockpiling of chemical arms, he added.
</P>
<P>
He called on world organizations, the International Atomic
Energy Agency in particular, to pressure Israel to join the NPT.

<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- China's National Headquarters for
Flood Control and Drought Relief has warned local governments
along the Yangtze River to remain alert for potential heavy
flooding in the region.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is likely to become even more serious,"
according to a notice reached here today. It notes that the
Yangtze's highest flood peak for the year is approaching the
middle reaches of the river valley and water levels in the lower
and middle reaches of the river continue to threaten waterlogged
dikes.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters urges leading officials to strengthen patrols
and remain at their posts to immediately handle dangerous
situations.
</P>
<P>
Weather and flood forecasts should be expanded, according to the
notice, which also called for more emergency vehicles and materials
to prepare for dangerous situations.
</P>
<P>
This morning's flood peak at Yichang in central China's Hubei
Province surged at 56,400 cu.m. per second, according to a report
which also stated that water levels in the lower and middle
reaches of the Yangtze were between 0.73 and 2.33 meters above
warning levels.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River has also witnessed its first flood peak of the
year which passed the Xiaolangdi Water Conservancy Project July
15 with a flow rate of 4,460 cu.m. per second. The flood peak is
currently approaching the lower reaches of the river valley.
</P>
<P>
Some 820,000 people are currently working diligently to
repair dikes along the Yangtze River, with related efforts
resulting in repairs to more than 1,000 dangerous areas. Over
10,000 workers equipped with some 570 pieces of machinery are

<HEADLINE> Egypt Welcomes Sudan's Ceasefire Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Egypt Saturday expressed welcome to
a three-month ceasefire reached by the Sudanese government and
rebels, the Egyptian Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt welcomes the ceasefire out of its keenness on the
integrity of Sudan and the unity of its people," a Foreign
Ministry spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), the only major rebel
faction continuing fighting government troops in the the country's
south, on Wednesday declared a three-month truce to allow aid
agencies deliver supplies to up to 2 million starving people.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government said on Thursday that it accepted the
ceasefire to facilitate food distribution in the famine-stricken
and drought-hit south.
</P>
<P>
The SPLA is still fighting for autonomy of the predominantly
Christian and animist south in a 15-year-old civil war, despite
that six rebel factions realized peace with the government last
year.
</P>
<P>
Egypt hopes this development would be followed by more serious
and positive steps to reach a comprehensive and just peace in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government and the rebels are due to hold peace
talks in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa next month. Both sides
agreed in the previous round of talks in Kenya in May to a vote
supervised internationally on self-determination in the south.

<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Two workers were killed and five
others wounded when a tractor of Cambodia' National Election Committee
(NEC) were attacked Friday afternoon by a group of armed bandits.
</P>
<P>
The attack took place at 10 kilometers northeast of Anlong Veng
near Cambodia-Thai border, said NEC secretary-general Im Suorsdei.
</P>
<P>
The tractor were carrying electoral materials to local polling
stations when it was raided by B-40 rocket launchers. The
electoral materials were all destroyed by the armed bandits.
</P>
<P>
Im Suorsdei said the attackers might be former members of Khmer
Rouge led by Ta Mok, who was still in the jungles near the border.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the effect of the incident, the NEC chief
said: "it's a pity something happened like this, but NEC would not
change its plan to hold general elections on July 26 as scheduled."
</P>
<P>
The situation now is better than 1993, when elections were held
under the supervision of the United Nations, he said, adding that
the coming elections will not be stopped by whatever sabotages.
</P>
<P>
If confirmed, it was the first Khmer Rouge attack since the

<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan announced on Saturday
to increase its gasoline prices by 25 percent in a bid to ease the
country's financial difficulties caused by the economic sanctions
imposed by the West for its nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
This is part of the "comprehensive economic packages" approved
by the Federal Cabinet Saturday to meet a 20 billion rupee (432
million U.S. dollar) gap in the country's internal resources, said
Dr. Hafiz Pasha, deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, at a
news conference here in the evening.
</P>
<P>
The packages will be announced shortly by Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif in his televised address to the nation, Pasha said.
</P>
<P>
The decision to increase gasoline prices will be effective from
midnight Saturday, Pasha said, adding this will help generate
additional 10 billion rupee (215 million dollar) revenue for the
country.
</P>
<P>
He said rest of the gap will be met by curtailing expenditures
and observing austerity measures in true spirit.
</P>
<P>
He categorically stated there was only one taxation proposal
regarding the gasoline prices.
</P>
<P>
There would be no other fiscal measures or further taxation to
generate further revenues at the moment to brave the impact of the
sanctions, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador to India Zhou
Gang on Friday urged India to immediately stop all baseless
accusations against China and take actual actions to improve
Sino-Indian relations.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with four major English newspapers here, Zhou
said, "It is known to all that since April and May, certain
personages in India made frequent accusations against China,
slandering that China posed a threat to India's security, which
has sabotaged the atmosphere of the Sino-Indian relations, harmed
the bilateral relations in the development and endangered the
future of the relations between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
The four newspapers are "The Times of India," "The Indian
Express," "The Telegraph" and "The Asian Age."
</P>
<P>
Zhou said, "The Chinese side sincerely hopes that the
above-mentioned abnormal situation should be reversed as early as
possible. But it is not up to the Chinese side. 'It is up to the
doer to undo the knot.' We hope that the Indian side will
immediately stop all baseless accusations against China."
</P>
<P>
On China's nuclear cooperation with Pakistan, Zhou said that
the program "only aims at peaceful use of nuclear energy, and it
is under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA). Therefore, the issue of nuclear proliferation is
non-existent and such cooperation is not directed against India."
</P>
<P>
Responsible as it is, the ambassador said, China has never
transfered, and will not transfer any equipment and technology
applicable in developing nuclear weapons to any country.
</P>
<P>
When asked about China's view over Sino-Indian border dispute,
Zhou said, "Needless to say, the Sino-Indian boundary has never
been officially demarcated."
</P>
<P>
"Regarding the issue left over by history, the Chinese side has
all along advocated peaceful solution through talks in accordance
with the principle of mutual understanding and mutual
accommodation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Pending the solution of the border issue, peace and
tranquillity must be maintained along the Line of Actual Control
(LAC) in the border areas," he added.

ULAN BATOR, July 18 (Xinhua) -- As the government's crackdown
on crimes is gaining marked success, the number of criminal cases
in Mongolia has been down for the first time since 1990.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of the year, 12,000 cases were registered in
Mongolia, down 10 percent from the same period last year,
according data released by Mongolian police authorities. In
total, 88 percent of these cases were cracked, up 2.7 percent from

</P>
<P>
Police authorities said robbery accounted for 51.6 percent of
the cases.

Mongolian President Nachagyn Bagabandy has been tough on crimes
since he took office last May. He has demanded law enforcement
authorities to step up fight against crimes, so as to restore
public order.
</P>
<P>
Police authorities have since beefed up measures to fend off
crimes, including increased night patrols, neighborhood watches,
and rewards for citizens who offer information on crimes.
</P>
<P>
Police authorities said crimes in the first six months of the
year have caused 9.6 billion tugrik (about 11.4 million
U.S. dollars) in damage, and 10.8 percent of the total was
effectively recovered.

(PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat Saturday met with visiting Jordanian
foreign minister in Ramallah, who came to help prepare for
Sunday's Palestinian-Israeli direct talks, the first in months.
</P>
<P>
Arafat discussed with Jawad Anani, who arrived in Ramallah
earlier Saturday, the cooperation between the PNA and Jordan in
advancing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The talks also focused on bilateral cooperation on other
issues, but no details were available.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator Abu Mazen is scheduled to meet
with Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai Sunday as
requested by U.S. officials. The two will hopefully reach an
agreement on Israel's second redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians have
been stalled for 16 months because of Israel's building of Jewish
settlement in controversial Arab East Jerusalem and its long
overdue second phase withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The PNA often consults with Jordan on the stalled peace
process. Arafat met with Jordan's King Hussein early this month in
Cairo in a three-way summit hosted by Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
The three leaders urged Israel to abandon its controversial
plan to expand Jerusalem far beyond its current borders and to put
some Jewish settlements in the West Bank under its jurisdiction.

LONDON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Talks resumed on Saturday in
Northern Ireland between Protestant Orangemen and the Catholic
residents to settle the two-week dispute over a banned Protestant
march down a Catholic road in Portadown.
</P>
<P>
The meeting began at a secret location as police continued to
question seven people over the Ballymoney arson murder that killed
three Catholic boys, said media reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of staunchly Protestant Orangemen and Catholics
from the Garvaghy Road in Portadown started their indirect talks a
week ago, with third party negotiators shuttling between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair's official spokesman said
Saturday's talks were not expected to produce quick results.
</P>
<P>
"We do not expect to resolve all the issues today. We hope to
make progress to be taken forward in more meetings next week," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Orange Order is still insisting it be allowed to march from
Drumcree parish church along the Garvaghy Road in Portadown, 50
kilometers southwest of Belfast. The marchers have been halted by
police since July 5.
</P>
<P>
The tense standoff sparked rioting throughout the province,
threatening the peace process that had a historic turn last April,
when a peace agreement was thrashed out by eight political parties
in Northern Ireland.

<HEADLINE> Party Official Urge Law Enforcement Discipline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Public security bureaus across
China should strengthen discipline and resolutely safeguard social
stability and national security, said Luo Gan, secretary
of the Political Science and Law Committee of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at today's session of a national law enforcement
conference, Luo, member of the Political Bureau and Secretariat,
of CPC Central Committee, said that all public security officers,
especially leading officials, should pay close attention to
studying Deng Xiaoping Theory in a bid to solve problems in the
country's public security system.
</P>
<P>
"Law enforcement officers should improve their sense of
responsibility and stringently avoid the worship of money,
hedonism and egoism," said Luo.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that serious problems center on committing
crimes under the pretext of implementing the law, accepting and
bribes and resorting to torture to obtain confessions.
</P>
<P>
"Related activities have not only seriously damaged the image
of law enforcement officers, but have also directly impaired the
prestige of both the Communist Party and government," he added.
</P>
<P>
He urged local public security bureaus to focus on major
problems and accelerate efforts to prevent and investigate
corruption and crimes in the judicial sector.
</P>
<P>
Those violating laws and regulations must be subject to severe
punishment, said Luo.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianxing, member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and member of the CPC Central
Committee Secretariat, also attended the conference along with the
directors of local public security bureaus.

<P>
AMMAN, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Foreign Minister Jawad
Anani left here Saturday for the Palestinian city of Ramallah to
help prepare Palestinians' first direct negotiation with Israel in
months.
</P>
<P>
Anani, also deputy prime minister for development affairs,
told Radio Jordan before departure that he will review with
Palestinian officials "chances of holding contacts with Israel."
The direct talks were scheduled for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said he will listen to the Palestinian points of view about
the upcoming negotiations and discuss with them possible
alternatives to save the Middle East peace process, the radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
The efforts will focus on seeking settlements to achieve
progress and put the peace process back on track, said Anani,
whose trip was made under the directives of Jordan's regent, Crown
Prince Hassan.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and
Palestinian chief negotiator Mohammod Abbas (Abu Mazan) will meet
to discuss the possibility of implementing a peace proposal put
forward by the United States.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has called on Israel to withdraw from another 13.1
percent of the West Bank in the second redeployment. The
Palestinians accepted the proposal but Israel rejected it.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations have been deadlocked
since March last year, when Israel began construction of Jewish
housing units in the Arab East Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Israel Warned Not to "Maneuver" Ahead of Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Ahead of the scheduled
Israeli-Palestinian direct talks, the Palestinians warned Israel
not to maneuver to avoid accepting the United States proposal for
a 13.1 percent further withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Saturday in Ramallah following a weekly
cabinet meeting Friday night, the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) said that a "positive Israeli response" to the U.S.
proposal was the only solid basis for the resumption of direct
talks.
</P>
<P>
"Any talks short of such a response would be "nothing more than
a maneuver," it was quoted by Israel Radio as saying.
</P>
<P>
Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat has confirmed that
Deputy Chairman of the PNA Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) will meet
with Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai Sunday in Tel
Aviv.
</P>
<P>
The PNA statement reiterated that the U.S. should publicize
its initiative on Israel's second redeployment in the West Bank
"without delay" and make clear who is to blame for the failure in
the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have accepted the U.S. proposal, which falls
far short of their original demand, but the U.S. has so far failed
to persuade Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accept it.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin Monday rapped
Israel for resisting the plan. But in an apparent nudge to
Netanyahu, he said one day later that creating an infrastructure
to fight terrorism "would happen better if the agreement were
reached."
</P>
<P>
Erekat, who has reiterated that the 13.1 percent withdrawal
proposed by the U.S. can never be renegotiated, was cited by
Israel Radio as saying that the PNA hopes Mordechai will come to
the talks with a mandate to accept the U.S. proposal.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai has clashed with Netanyahu earlier this week over
the agenda of the coming talks. Netanyahu was said to give the
defense minister limited authority but Mordechai demanded a free
hand in the talks.
</P>
<P>
Latest reports said Netanyahu plans to give Mordechai "all
necessary powers" to conclude an agreement on the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said Mordechai would suggest in the meeting that
joint committees be set up to work separately on redeployment, the
Palestinian Covenant and security issues, and the committees
should conclude their works within a week.
</P>
<P>
Direct Israeli-Palestinian talks broke down 16 months ago when
Israel began building a Jewish settlement in the Arab East
Jerusalem. The Palestinians have rejected more than once the
Israeli request that the talks be resumed, saying that what is
needed to break the deadlock in the peace process is the Israeli
acceptance of the U.S. proposals, not talks.
</P>
<P>
The coming resumption of direct talks was called upon recently
by U.S. officials, who said that the impasse could not be break
without the two sides talking to each other.
</P>
<P>
The last meeting between Mordechai and Abu Mazen was in
February when they toured an airport under construction in Gaza
Strip. Disputes over security have held up the opening of the
airport.

<HEADLINE> Koizumi Becomes 3rd Candidate for LDP Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Health and Welfare Minister
Junichiro Koizumi formally declared his candidacy Saturday for the
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) presidential election, becoming the
third candidate in the July 24 race.
</P>
<P>
Koizumi, 56, will run against Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi,
61, and former Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama, 72, for
the LDP's top job. Both Obuchi and Kajiyama declared their
candidacies Friday.
</P>
<P>
In announcing his candidacy, Koizumi pledged to save Japan's
economy, adding that he will reconsider the Fiscal Structural
Reform Law, which prevents the government from spending on
economic stimulus measures.
</P>
<P>
He said he will also pursue drastic measures to disclose and clean
up the banking industry's enormous bad-loan crisis and to reform the
tax system to bring it in line with international standards.
</P>
<P>
Koizumi, a third-generation politician, is backed by many
younger LDP lawmakers. He ran in the previous LDP presidential
race in 1995 but lost to Ryutaro Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto submitted his resignation as LDP president Monday to
take responsibility for the LDP's major setback in last Sunday's
House of Councillors (upper house) election.
</P>
<P>
The three candidate will officially register for the race
Tuesday. The LDP president will be elected Friday by 413 LDP
members.
</P>
<P>
The new LDP president is sure to become prime minister as the
party holds a majority in the the House of Representatives (lower
house), which will elect a new prime minister on July 30.

<P>
MOSCOW, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
left here Saturday for Shuiskaya Chupa in the Republic of Karelia,
northwestern Russia, to spend part of his summer vacation.
</P>
<P>
Before the departure, said an Itar-Tass news agency report,
Yeltsin met Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko and Kremlin Chief of
Staff Valetin Yumashev at his Gorki 9 countryside retreat.
</P>
<P>
They reportedly discussed and set deadlines for putting into
practice laws from the stabilization program package that have
been mostly passed by the State Duma and the Federal Council.
</P>
<P>
The government's tax laws have been voted down by the Duma.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Kiriyenko told reporters that the package
"will be probably signed by the end of the day."
</P>
<P>
He said the Duma had done a good deal of work on the
govenrment-introduced tax laws, but voted down some of them which
he said would allow the industry to relieve the tax burden.
</P>
<P>
There are no different stabilization programs of the
government, the Federal Council and State Duma, rather there is
only one stabilization program backed by all, Kiriyenko said.
</P>
<P>
The premier has left for Oryol to attend a conference of
Russia's central black soil regions.

<HEADLINE> Assad Confirms He Will Visit Lebanon This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
confirmed here Saturday that he will visit Lebanon before the end
of this year.
</P>
<P>
During a brief meeting with the press before he was due to
leave Paris at the end of a three-day state visit, Assad was asked
if he would visit Lebanon as was announced by Lebanese Prime
Minister Rafiq Hariri in June. He answered, "Yes."
</P>
<P>
Syria exerts great influence over Lebanon under a treaty of
fraternity, cooperation and coordination signed in 1991 and has
deployed 30,000 troops in Lebanon since.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese leaders go to Damascus frequently for consultations,
but the Syrian president has never visited Beirut.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Assad, French President Jacques Chirac
said that France supports an independent and free Lebanon with
sovereignty over all its territory.
</P>
<P>
Assad also told the press that Syria will not seek to increase
its military strength because Damascus intends to seek peace.
</P>
<P>
"It is not reasonable to say that we want war," he said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the French TF1 television on the eve of
his state visit to France, Assad warned that there existed the
risk of war in the Middle East because of the stand of Israel.
</P>
<P>
But he gave a more positive tone on Saturday by saying that
several countries are working to find a solution to the deadlock
of the Middle East peace process, although the existing
differences among them need a long time to solve.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between Syria and Israel have been suspended
since 1996.
</P>
<P>
On the occupation by Israel of the so-called "security zone" in
south Lebanon, Assad said that Israeli troops should leave
Lebanon "as they entered it."
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the rapprochement of relations between
Israel and Turkey, which he said does not have "good intentions."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China and the
Ministry of Supervision today published a joint circular calling
for reinforced efforts to combat smuggling.
</P>
<P>
The circular urges discipline inspection and supervision
departments at all levels to earnestly implement the spirit of the
recent national meeting on anti-smuggling and calls Chinese
President Jiang Zemin made for promptly dealing with major
smuggling cases in accordance with law.
</P>
<P>
The circular called for all Party and government departments
to join judicial and law enforcement departments in eradicating
sources of rampant smuggling and battling corruption. It
instructed related organizations to sever ties with companies and
business entities, and totally separate the management of revenues
from fines and expenditures.
</P>
<P>
All fines must be handed over to the central treasury and no
unit or individual is permitted to withhold or misappropriate
related funds, according to the circular.
</P>
<P>
It also prohibited officials from accepting positions with or
operating private business ventures, including private
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The circular called on discipline inspection and supervision
personnel working in customs, public security, judicial, and
industrial and commercial administrative departments to be fully
committed to their responsibilities and steadfastly battle
smuggling activities, especially activities within their
respective organizations.

<HEADLINE> At Least 30 People Dead, Hundreds Missing in PNG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- A 10-metre high tidal wave swept
away villages on Papua New Guinea (PNG)'s remote north-west coast,
leaving at least 30 people dead, hundreds missing and thousands
homeless.
</P>
<P>
The tidal wave struck the town of Aitape in the West Sepik
province and villages east and west of the township, between 8 and
8.30 p.m. on Friday night, local disaster control authorities were
quoted by the Australian Associated Press Saturday from Port
Moresby.
</P>
<P>
They said the tidal wave followed an earthquake measuring 7.0
on the Richter scale 20 to 30 kilometers off the coast about an
hour earlier.
</P>
<P>
Austen Crapp, a relief coordinator in Aitape, said at least two
villages west of Aitape (Arop and Warapu) had been "wiped out".
</P>
<P>
"At Warapu, a village with a population of 1,800 people, there
is no house standing ," Crapp said, "at Arop, a village with a
population of 1,800 to 2,000 people, there's nothing standing
there."
</P>
<P>
Crapp said both villages, about 500 metros apart, were situated
on a spit of land between the ocean and the Sissano lagoon.
</P>
<P>
Crapp said a shaken helicopter pilot who had landed in Aitape
had reported seeing bodies floating among the debris in the
lagoon.
</P>
<P>
"There are 30 confirmed dead, most of them are children, and
more than 3000 people in the area were now homeless," Crapp added.
</P>
<P>
PNG provincial disaster coordinator Peter Tavun said homeless
survivors were in desperate need of food and shelter.
</P>
<P>
The tidal wave consisted of three waves striking in quick
succession, Crapp said.
</P>
<P>
"It would have been all over in 10 minutes," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the night-time, in the dark, people were screaming, yelling
and looking for people."
</P>
<P>
Crapp said survivors were still hiding in the bush, frightened
that there would be another earthquake.
</P>
<P>
The last tidal wave in the area had been in December 1930 when
an earthquake registering 6.5 on the Richter scale had struck the
Admirality Islands.

<HEADLINE> Russia Assures Iran Respect for Accords on Caspian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Saturday assured Iran
that it would respect the 1921 and 1940 Tehran-Moscow accords on
the Caspian Sea despite a recent Russia-Kazakhstan agreement to
divide their national waters.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Morteza
Sarmadi, visiting Russian First Deputy Foreign Minister Boris
Pastukhov said the two documents continue to be valid until a new
legal regime for the Caspian is completed.
</P>
<P>
Pastukhov said that in all its provisions, Russia-Kazakhstan
agreement has underlined the need for speedy determination of the
legal regime and some provisions would go into effect when all the
littoral states reach a consensus on the regime.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Kazakhstan signed an agreement on July 6 on dividing
the northern part of the Caspian Sea into national zones, which
aroused Iran's concern about the future of the world's large
inland water.
</P>
<P>
The Caspian has an estimated reserve of 16 billion barrels of
oil and 8.3 trillion cubic meters of gas, but reportedly far from
the shore of Iran.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to the agreement, Iran said the legal regime for
the sea has been provided by the 1921 Treaty of Amity signed by
Iran and Russia and the 1940 Commerce and Navigation Agreement
between Iran and the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
The two accords determine mutual ownership of the Caspian by
Tehran and Moscow. But following the collapse of the former Soviet
Union, the newly independent republics demand the sea be divided
among the five littoral states, which also include Turkmenistan
and Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
Iran prefers "equal rights" over the Caspian by the littoral
states, but said it would accept an equal and fair division if all
agree.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to remove Tehran's concern over the Russia-Kazakhstan
agreement, Pastukhov arrived here Friday to explain Russia's
stance. He said that it would not be to the benefit of Moscow to
distance itself from Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Sarmadi stressed that the Caspian is a priority of Iran's
foreign policy and that good Iran-Russia relations would provide a
suitable ground for cooperation in developing the sea.
</P>
<P>
Unilateral measures would not help determine the legal regime
and continuation of the current trend would create tension in the
region, he added.

<HEADLINE> Hu Jintao Addresses Initiative of Young Intellectuals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese leader today
encouraged young Chinese intellectuals to carry forward the
tradition of the Chinese nation to blaze new trails and devote
themselves to promoting the country's scientific and technological
progress.
</P>
<P>
While speaking to a group of young Chinese specialists
participating in a study of China's practical situation, Hu
Jintao, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau
of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC),
said that China faces both golden opportunities and severe
challenges in building socialism with Chinese characteristics in
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Hu quoted Chinese President Jiang Zemin as saying earlier that
the progress of science and technology and the advance of every
social undertaking call for constant effort of blazing new trails,
which depends on talented people, especially the talented young
people.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Jiang's admonition fully demonstrates the ardent
expectations of the Party and the country concerning young
intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that young intellectuals will earnestly study
Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought and especially Deng Xiaoping
Theory and contribute to the prosperity of the country and the
Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
The young people of China should have a good understanding of
the country's actual situation and will conscientiously plunge
themselves to the reform, opening-up and modernization drive of
their motherland, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
He added that young intellectuals should sharpen their
awareness of the need for deploying their initiative and putting
forth new ideas, and study diligently to keep abreast with the
development of modern science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Hu also stressed the need for ideological accomplishments on
the part of young intellectuals, and said they should become well
educated professionals.
</P>
<P>
The group, sponsored by the Organization Department of the CPC
Central Committee, is comprised of 32 young specialists from all
walks of life. The group conducted a fact-finding tour of
northwest China's Qinghai Province between July 5-16.

GUANGZHOU, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The 33rd Hong Kong International
Industrial Products Fair will be held in Guangzhou, capital of
south China's Guangdong Province, from October 16-29.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Assad's France Trip A Total Success: Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The visit of Syrian President Hafez
al Assad to France which features talks on Mideast peace was a
total success, Syrian Ambassador to France Elias Negma said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Interviewed by the Cairo-based Voice of Arabs Radio over
telephone, Negma said Assad's visit to France gave both sides a
chance to discuss the vital issues of the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
The trip, Assad's first ever to France in 22 years, is
reportedly aimed at seeking an alternative to U.S. mediation in
negotiations with Israel that have gone nowhere for more than two
years.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said that Syria and France share identical views
regarding the Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab
territories to realize just and comprehensive peace in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
The visit came within the context of developing relations with
France thanks to its major role inside the European Union to reach
a unified European stance regarding the Mideast peace process, he
added.
</P>
<P>
"France totally comprehends the Syrian stance regarding the
peace march as Damascus has already chosen peace as a strategic
goal," said the Syrian ambassador.
</P>
<P>
Assad, at the end of his three-day visit to France, will fly to
Cairo Saturday to discuss with President Hosni Mubarak the latest
developments in the region.
</P>
<P>
Chirac has tried in his talks with the Syrian president in
Paris Friday to engage him in the Egyptian-French initiative on
holding a peace conference to salvage the long-stalled Mideast
peace process, France Inter Radio said Saturday, commenting on
Assad's talks in the French capital.
</P>
<P>
Assad, on his part, did not reject the Egyptian-French
initiative but he, however, did not explicitly announce his
acceptance of the initiative.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to break the deadlock facing the peace march, the
French and Egyptian presidents proposed in May to hold an
international conference, including all parties concerned with the
peace process to discuss re-launching the peace drive.
</P>
<P>
Assad has refused to resume talks with Israel unless it returns
the occupied Golan Heights to Syria, a term allegedly promised by
Israel's former Labor government led by assassinated Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
With the U.S.-sponsored peace process hitting snags in all
tracks, Arab countries increasingly favor a more active European
diplomacy in reaching a just and comprehensive peace in the
region.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Urge Israel to Accept U.S. Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Ahead of the direct
Israeli-Palestinian talks scheduled Sunday, the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) urged the Israeli side to accept the
U.S. proposal for a 13.1 percent further withdrawal from the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Saturday in the West Bank city Ramallah
following its weekly cabinet meeting on Friday night, the PNA said
that a "positive Israeli response" to the U.S. proposal was the
only solid basis for the resumption of the direct talks.
</P>
<P>
It said that any resumption of talks without such a response
would be "nothing more than a maneuver," Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat has confirmed the
scheduled meeting between Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai and Secretary-General of Palestine Liberation
Organization Executive Committee Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen). The
meeting will take place Sunday in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
The PNA statement reiterated that the U.S. should make public
its initiative on the second further redeployment in the West Bank
"without delay" and make clear who is to be blamed for the failure
in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have accepted the 13.1 percent proposal,
which falls far short of its original demand, but the U.S. has
failed to persuade Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to
accept it.
</P>
<P>
Erekat, who has reiterated that the 13.1 percent withdrawal
proposed by the U.S. can never be renegotiated, was cited by the
radio as saying that the PNA hopes Mordechai will come to the
talks with a mandate to accept the U.S. proposal.

<HEADLINE> Crisis Over Wage Increase in Turkey's Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit declared here Saturday that an agreement was
reached among three coalition partners over the wage increase for
the public sector.
</P>
<P>
This shows that a two-week-long crisis over the wage hike was
solved. Under the agreement, the wages for the public sector will
be increased by 20 percent in the first three months starting from
July of this year and another 10 percent in the second three
months from October, Ecevit said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached early Saturday morning by Motherland
Party (ANAP) Chairman and Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz, Ecevit,
also leader of the Democratic Left Party (DSP) and Democratic
Turkey Party (DTP) Chairman Husamettin Cindoruk through several
rounds of talks.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit added that the agreement will be signed by the
coalition members later Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz, leader of the senior coalition partner, said on Tuesday
that "I would not give half a percentage point more than 20
percent" to the wage rise for the public sector employees.
</P>
<P>
However, DTP demanded on Monday that public sector's wages be
raised by 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
The DTP warned that if the demand was not accepted by the ANAP
and DSP, its ministers would not sign the decision on a 20 percent
wage hike and would continue their struggle in the government.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz argued that even a 20 percent wage hike would cost 280
trillion Turkish Liras (about 1 billion U.S. dollars), and it was
impossible to finance a 40 percent wage hike from the existing
budget.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, members of the Ankara Doctor's Board protested the
delay in the pay raises and the proposed amount of increases,
demanding a reasonable pay raise which would give them a decent
standard of living and better working conditions.

<HEADLINE> IMF Backs Thailand's Move to Lower Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has gained the support of
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to ease high interest rates
as the baht has gained stability, a government official confirmed
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has maintained high interest rates in the past to help
boost confidence in the baht currency for economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
The official said IMF representative in Thailand Reza Moghadam
on Friday signaled the organization's approval of Thailand's move
to lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The official quoted Reza as saying that the IMF fully supports
Thailand's interest rate policy and the general monetary policy
aimed at reviving the battered economy.
</P>
<P>
In the latest review in May of Thailand's economic reform and
progress, the IMF had agreed with the Thai government that there
was room to reduce interest rates, but that had to be done
cautiously and without jeopardizing exchange rate stability.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's interest rates are among the highest in the region
with the minimum lending rate at 15.25-15.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
But in recent weeks the authorities have moved to bring down
short-term rates as the baht has been at a stable 40-42 per dollar
level. The central bank's one-day repo rate, which hit a high of
23 percent in March, has now eased to around 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
The official confirmed press reports that Thailand and the IMF
would seek ways to stimulate the economy at talks scheduled for
next month to review the economic progress.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi said earlier
that for the next review with the IMF, the Thai government would
try to put together a package of stimulus measures to ensure
against a further decline in the economy and bring about gradual
recovery.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said the economy had slowed down more than the
government had expected and that gross domestic product had
contracted in the first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
"This will be taken into account in the next review of the IMF
program, which earlier projected a decline in real GDP of about
4-5.5 percent this year," Supachai told a meeting of economists in
Bangkok.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Tries to Contain Wildfires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR Es Salaam, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzania National Parks
Authority (TANAPA) will create buffer zones to contain wildfires
which threaten the country's national parks during the dry
season.
</P>
<P>
The TANAPA's Public Relations Manager, James Lembeli, was
quoted by Dar es Salaam newspapers on Saturday as saying that
firebreaks will be created on the border between national parks
and villages especially in the dry season.
</P>
<P>
Lembeli explained that the exercise includes burning parts of
plants in the border areas to prevent wildfires in villages from
spreading into national parks.
</P>
<P>
The exercise was conducted every year in Mount Kilimanjaro,
Tangarine, Mikumi and Arusha national parks which are prone to
wildfires, he said, adding that if the exercise is not done, the
destruction of vegetation and habitat of the animals become
enormous.
</P>
<P>
Wildfires last year caused heavy destruction to Kilimanjaro,
the Africa's highest mountain located in north Tanzania. A
two-week fire in September affected 100 square meters of bush and
forest.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, TANAPA organized a weeklong campaign to
increase people's awareness of protecting wildlife.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Singapore PM Wins Higher Damage on Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's Court of Appeal has
awarded Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong higher damages in his appeal
on the defamation suit against opposition leader J.B. Jeyaretnam
but disagreed with the criticism against the trial judge by the
prime minister's lawyer, according to local English newspaper the
Straits Times Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In their 62-page judgment released Friday and singed by Chief
Justice Yong Pung How, Justices M Karthigesu and L. P. Thean, the
three judges ruled that the prime minister be awarded 100,000
Singapore dollars in damages and full costs of the hearing and the
appeal, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
But the court disagreed with the PM's lawyer Davinder Singh
that the trial judge of the High Court failed to take all the
relevant factors into account, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
In September last year, High Court judge Justice S. Rajendran
found that Workers' Party Secretary General Jeyaretnam had defamed
Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong at a rally on the eve of the 1996
general elections.
</P>
<P>
The High Court judge ordered Jeyaretnam to pay the prime
minister 20,000 Singapore dollars and 60 percent of the legal
costs.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong refused to accept the ruling,
saying he deserves more in damages as his reputation and integrity
had been undermined.
</P>
<P>
Jeyaretnam, who is facing seven other defamation suits by
leaders of the People's Action Party for the words he used at the
rally, also appealed against Justice Rajendran's verdict, arguing
that the words were not defamatory and that, if they were, the
damages awarded earlier to the prime minister should be reduced to
a nominal sum. Jeyaretnam's appeal was rejected by the Appeal
Court.

<HEADLINE> China Successfully Launches European Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XICHANG, July 18 (Xinhua) -- China successfully launched the
Sinosat-1 telecommunications satellite manufactured mainly by
Aerospatiale of France at 17:20 (Beijing time) today from the
Xichang Satellite Launch Center in southwest China's Sichuan
Province.
</P>
<P>
The satellite was carried into orbit by the Long March 3B
carrier rocket, marking the first time China has launched a
telecommunications satellite produced in a European country with
the Long March rocket family.
</P>
<P>
This was the 53rd launch of a Chinese-made Long March rocket.
</P>
<P>
The satellite and the rocket separated 1,495 seconds after
launching. Twenty minutes later, initial data from the Xi'an
Satellite Monitoring and Control Center indicated that the
Sinosat-1 had entered its predetermined geosynchronous orbit at a
perigee of 600 km, apogee of 35,946 km, and bank angle of 19
degrees.
</P>
<P>
The Aerospatiale will be responsible for monitoring and
controlling the satellite, which will be positioned at 110.5 east
longitude above the equator.
</P>
<P>
The commercial launch service contract was signed in July 1996
between the China Great Wall Industry Corporation and a
Germany-based space technology company.
</P>
<P>
The Sinosat-1 is the first commercial telecommunications
satellite managed by the Sino Satellite Communications Company
Ltd. of China.
</P>
<P>
The satellite carries 24 C-band transponders and 14 KU-band
transponders which cover the entire Asia-Pacific region including
China and its neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
With a designed life span of 15 years, the satellite will
provide multiple services to the country's financial
electronization program and air transportation control system, the
Shanghai information port project, and so on.
</P>
<P>
The Long March 3B carrier rocket used to launch the Sinosat-1
is now the country's most powerful satellite launch vehicle, which
is developed by the Chinese Academy of Carrier Rocket
Technology. It is capable of sending a 5,000-kg payload into
geosynchronous orbit.
</P>
<P>
Since launching the Philippines' Mabuhay telecommunications
satellite on Augest 20, 1997, the Long March 3B has successfully
sent satellites into predetermined orbit four times.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the launch of the Sinosat-1, China had succeeded in
launching 10 foreign telecommunications satellites and 6 Iridium
satellites that were all made in the United States.
</P>
<P>
According to international practice, technicians and experts
from the Chinese side participated in all the processes of
assembly and testing, when manufacturing the Sinosat-1, and 80
percent of the fund involved in the contract was financed by
German banking institutions.
</P>
<P>
A leading official of the concerned department says the success
of the Sinosat-1 launch has created a new starting point of
cooperation in space technology between China, France and Germany,
thus indicating broad prospects for cooperation in space
technology between China and European countries.

<HEADLINE> ECB to Pronounce Monetary Policy in October at Latest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Central Bank (ECB)
is due to announce its monetary policy in September or October at
the latest.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's edition of the journal European Report quoted ECB
President Wim Duisenberg as saying that objectives concerning
price stability and monetary supply would be made known "in
September or at the latest in October."
</P>
<P>
The ECB governor pledged that the activities of the
Frankfurt-based bank would be extremely transparent so that there
would be no secrecy surrounding the ECB decisions.
</P>
<P>
The fear for decision-making secrecy was raised by European
Parliament members who called on the bank to adopt an explicit
final targeted figure for inflation rates and money supply as part
of the preparation for the final transition to single currency.
</P>
<P>
The euro, as the single currency is called, will come into use
for non-cash transactions starting on January 1 next year while
euro coins and banknotes will replace the national currencies of
the 11 euro member countries on January 1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
Duisenberg, a Dutch national, said that the euro notes had been
designed after taking into account the opinions of associations
for the blind and partially sighted.
</P>
<P>
"The seven notes differ in size and color," said the ECB chief,
"Their figures have a raised design and the colors stand out
clearly so that the partially sighted can recognize them."
</P>
<P>
Eleven of the 15 European Union member states have joined the
single currency mechanism and they are Austria, Belgium, Germany,
Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Portugal and Spain.
</P>
<P>
EU member states Britain, Sweden, Denmark and Greece were not
in the euro zone.

PARIS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- France has welcomed the creation of
a permanent International Criminal Court (ICC) by the United
Nations at a conference in Rome Friday.
</P>
<P>
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said in a communique issued

<HEADLINE> Lukashenko Says Western Countries Want to Unseat Him </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Belarus regarded the European
Union's decision to deny entry visas to stop Belarussian officials
as an action planned to unseat the Belarussian leader, the
Interfax news agency reported from Minsk Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a televised speech Friday evening Belarussian President
Alexander Lukashenko noted the EU and the United States sought to
unseat him.
</P>
<P>
He said this had been the source of a current scandal over a
decision by the Belarussian leadership to evict foreign
ambassadors from lodgings on the Drozdy compound near Minsk.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko said that the West, primarily the United States,
uses the "Drozdy scandal ... for putting pressure on the
independent policy of Belarus in order to change the government
system existing in the country."
</P>
<P>
If the Drozdy problem is solved, a new one will arise in two
or three months, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Russia's Federation Council was also deeply concerned over
the sharp aggravation of relations between Belarus and EU member
states and accused the EU of putting unreasonable pressure on a
sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
It urged European countries' parliaments to take "constructive
practical steps to normalize relations" between European states
and Belarus.

<HEADLINE> India Denies Nuclear Link With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 18 (Xinhua) -- A visiting Indian senior official
has denied that his country cooperated with Israel in nuclear
technology, the Daily Star newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Secretary Nareshwar Dayal, the highest career diplomat
of India, was quoted as saying "The reports suggesting India's
cooperation with Israel in the field of nuclear technology are
false."
</P>
<P>
He made the remark after the signing of a nuclear cooperation
agreement with his Lebanese counterpart Zafer Hassan here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
At a joint news conference, Hassan said India's nuclear
technology will benefit Lebanon for peaceful purposes.
</P>
<P>
Dayal, who came to Lebanon on a regional tour on Thursday, said
his country has suspended additional nuclear tests since May 13
when India staged the last test.
</P>
<P>
"India is committed to global disarmament and is working very
hard to push its agenda of a universal and non-discriminatory
policy on this level," Dayal said.
</P>
<P>
India's testing heightened tension in the South Asia
subcontinent and incurred world-wide criticism. Neighboring
Pakistan carried out its own tests a few days later in response.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has accused Israel of providing India with a system
which helped it carry out the tests.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon May Bar Imports to Avoid Millennium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon is considering to ban the
imports of electronic devices which are not equipped to operate in
the year 2,000 in an effort to avoid the millennium problem.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Minister of Administrative Reforms Bishara Mirhij has
asked the Justice Ministry to draw up a law to this effect, the
Daily Star newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The millennium problem threatens to cripple information system
at the end of the century as old electronic devices become unable
to process dates correctly after December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Mirhij also suggested that violators of the proposed law should
receive six months in prison with hard labor and a fine of 5
million-Lebanese pounds (about 3,000 U.S. dollars), according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
Testifying the necessity of the law, Mirhij noted that some
machines, such as computers, elevators, air conditioners, alarm
systems and telephone centrals will have program failures because
they are not programmed to switch to 2000.
</P>
<P>
Non-equipped devices which would either turn to zero or to
1900 would suffer complete or partial breakdown, he added.
</P>
<P>
"If the necessary precautions are not taken, the country will
suffer serious damage," he said.
</P>
<P>
In May, Lebanon's central bank worked out a three-stage plan
designed to cope with the inability of many computers to handle
21st century dates.
</P>
<P>
The bank has asked other commercial banks and institutions to
form a special committee to deal with this problem.

WUHAN, July 18 (Xinhua) -- China has increased output of thin
steel plates for making outer shells of cars by improving the
technology of a steel company in central China's Wuhan city.
</P>

Wuhan Iron and Steel Company in Hubei province became the
second steel plant that can produce such thin steel plates in the
country following Baoshan Iron and Steel Company in Shanghai.

During an experimental period since March, Wuhan Iron and Steel
Company has turned out 8,000 tons of thin steel plates with
advanced technology and equipment of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
It spent nearly ten years to crack technological hard nuts and
successfully reduced the content of carbon, silicon and nitrogen
in steel. Tests proved that the steel plates have reached the
quality level of similar products of well-known international
steel companies.

LUANDA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Defense Minister Pedro
Sebastiao has said that the government army will fight back
immediately against the opposition National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) if it is necessary.
</P>
<P>
With the UNITA's operations escalating, the government army
has no other choice but to fight back at proper time, Sebastiao
said here Friday night before leaving for Lisbon to attend the
conference of defense ministers of the Community of the
Portuguese-Speaking Countries.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan defense minister said he agreed with President
Jose Eduardo dos Santos in describing what the UNITA is doing, in
which the president said that the UNITA is waging "an undeclared
war."
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government forces have the right to halting
turmoils and protecting the national security, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, the UNITA has steadily made
provocations against the government, damaging the peace process.
Its remnant soldiers ambushed vehicles running normally on the
roads, looted the government institutions and residents, and
launched attacks at the bases of the government troops, national
police and even the United Nations observers mission.
</P>
<P>
Facing such destabilizing situation, the Angolan government
has shown great constraint and not taken any actions against the
opposition movement, said the defense minister.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the conference of the defense ministers of the
Community of the Portuguese-Speaking Countries scheduled for July
20 to 22, Sebastiao said that the conference will focus its
discussions on the military technology cooperation, the personnel
training in particular.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Release of Prisoners Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 18 (Xinhua) -- South African opposition
parties have expressed shock at the government's decision to
release 9,000 convicts to mark President Nelson Mandela's 80th
birthday.
</P>
<P>
Correctional Services Minister Sipho Mzimela said Friday that
prisoners to be freed from Monday would be those who had six
months or less to serve in prisons. The release process would
take about two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Mzimela said: "all sentenced inmates" would be granted six
months special remission of sentence.
</P>
<P>
In response, opposition parties said the government's decision
was at the cost of ordinary citizens who had long had to bear the
brunt of violent crime.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a happy birthday present for South Africa," local
daily the Citizen Saturday quoted Democratic Party spokesman
James Selfe as reporting.
</P>
<P>
National Party spokesman Gert Oosthuizen said: "It is amazing
that President Mandela decides to grant remission to all
sentenced inmates... it is unique that the head of state is in
effect giving a birthday present to sentenced criminals."
</P>
<P>
The United Democratic Movement also criticized the decision,
describing it as "rediculous".
</P>
<P>
According to Correctional Services Commissioner Khulekani
Sitole, the release of the prisoners would ease the pressure on
accomodation. South African prisons at the present had 148,000
inmates.
</P>
<P>
The ruling African National Congress led by President Mandela
defended the decision, saying that the decision to grant
prisoners a six-month remission would not have been taken lightly
and without due consideration of the best intersts of society.
</P>
<P>
the government would take whatever means necessary to ensure
the prisoners were properly reitegrated into society, the ANC
said.

<HEADLINE> Iran: POW Issue With Iraq to Be Settled in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Iran said on Saturday that Tehran
and Baghdad would finally settle the issue of prisoners of war
(POW) left over from the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war within six months.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Persian newspaper Iran, Deputy
Foreign Minister for Arab-African affairs Seyed Mohammad Sadr
said that all Iranian POWs would return home according to a time
table.
</P>
<P>
During the past eight years, Iran and Iraq exchanged 54,776
Iraqi POWs with 39,364 Iranians. But it is not clear how many
Iranian and Iraqi POWs are still being held by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time that Iranian officials expressed
optimism for an end for the POW files with Iraq. Head of Iran's
POWs Commission Abdollah Najafi said on Friday that progress has
been made in the recent talks between Iranian and Iraqi officials
on the identification of the POWs.
</P>
<P>
Najafi said with the current "goodwill trend," everything
regarding POWs of the two countries would be fully clarified
within the next few months.
</P>
<P>
Sadr said that Iran hopes the U.N. Security Council resolution
598 on the Iran-Iraq war will be completely implemented in order
to set up a thorough peace between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Iran accepted the U.N. Security Council resolution 598 on July
18, 1988 to end the war. But on the 10th anniversary of the
resolution, many issues left over from the war still remain
unsolved, including the sensitive POW issue.
</P>
<P>
Sadr said that so far the articles of the resolution 598
concerning the cease-fire, withdrawal of two countries' armed
forces to the internationally recognized borders and determination
of the aggressor have been carried out.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the issues such as war reparation, peace
between the two countries as well as pilgrimage have not been
settled according to the resolution.

<HEADLINE> EU-Iran Dialog Resumed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) Troika
delegation arrived here Saturday morning, kicking off a new round
of the EU "critical dialog" with Iran after a suspension of more
than one year.
</P>
<P>
According to Tehran radio, the Troika delegation was led by
Secretary General of the Austrian Foreign Ministry Albert Rohan
with participation of officials from Britain, Austria and Germany,
the past, current and future EU presidents.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, Rohan said that the EU delegation would
exchange views on the issues concerned by both sides, including
the issues of Afghanistan, Central Asia, Balkan, disarmament,
terrorism and human rights.
</P>
<P>
Rohan said that other topics would be issues of economy,
energy, environmental protection, campaigns against drug
trafficking and cultural exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The EU launched the so-called "critical dialog" with Iran in
December, 1992 with an aim to soften Iran's policies on the Middle
East peace process, international terrorism and production of
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The dialog was suspended in April, 1997 after a Berlin court
verdict accused Iranian leaders of being behind a terrorist
assassination of Iranian dissidents in Germany. The EU decided to
resume talks with Iran in March after the two sides ended the
diplomatic row over the Berlin court ruling.

<HEADLINE> Albanian P.M. Talks with FIC on Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Albania's Prime Minister, Fatos
Nano met with representatives of the International Financial
Corporation (IFC) Friday to discuss the possibility of assisting
and crediting private sectors in Albania.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the prime minister quoted Nano as saying that
after one year of financial reform, the government is very much
interested in supporting business and investment, and creating
facilitating conditions by stability and improved legislation.
</P>
<P>
The possibilities for investing in Albania are increasing, said
Nano, especially with the beginning of mass privatisation. The
strategic sectors including telecommunications, energy,
agriculture and tourism will be of priority.
</P>
<P>
Nano said that in the context of regional initiatives, the IFC
may finance a number of projects which would help unify markets in
the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Joint financial investments was one of the ways to establish
peace in the Balkans, as well as integrate Albania into global
markets.
</P>
<P>
In the coming months, the solution of conflicts on land
properties through improvement in legislation will be of
priority. This will also remove the last obstacle for serious
investments, Nano said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that privatisation of the banking system will start
soon. This may facilitate the activities of foreign investors and
encourage business in general.
</P>
<P>
The IFC representatives presented their projects in Albania
such as financing the oil-extraction projects of Patos-Marinza,
worth $ 58 million, and expressed interest in crediting the
construction of material productions, telecommunication and other
activities.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Restructure Banking System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's credit institutions are to
be restructured in a government plan which focuses on state-owned
and commercial joint-stock banks, Vietnam news Friday quoted a
senior official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam now has 85 banks and nearly 1,000 people's credit funds
operating nation-wide.
</P>
<P>
Six of these banks are state-owned, 51 are commercial
joint-stock banks, four are joint-ventures and 24 are operated
overseas.
</P>
<P>
The government's plan is aimed at overcoming the country's
current financial fragility and creating a new dynamism to tackle
challenges caused by regional crisis, deputy governor of State
Bank of Vietnam Tran Minh Tuan said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the restructuring of the state-owned banks would
be undertaken immediately to ensure stability in their operations
and development. It would focus on inefficient investment and
outstanding loans.
</P>
<P>
Under the government plan, the restructuring of commercial
joint-stock banks was aimed at speeding their development and
allowing them to grow into strong large-scale private joint-stock
banks with a regional presence.
</P>
<P>
Inefficient joint-stock banks would be asked to improve
financial management and those without legal capital would have
their operations narrowed, taken over by more efficient banks, or
closed down so as not to threaten the country's banking system.

<HEADLINE> On-Farm Computer Use Growing in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Over 40 percent of New Zealand
farms now have computers, Meat New Zealand said in a press release
issued here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The press release said that with support from Meat New Zealand,
Lincoln University, an agricultural university in South Island of
New Zealand, carried out a research earlier this year. The
national postal survey of 3,021 randomly selected primary
producers was conducted to investigate the penetration of
"on-farm" computers and clarify details of their use. A total of
1,437 valid replies was received.
</P>
<P>
The research showed an increase of "computer farms" from 6
percent in 1986 and 24.4 percent in 1993 to 42.7 percent this
year. It also showed that managers have higher levels of formal
education, are younger and are involved in more off-farm business.
</P>
<P>
Typical computer use is around 20 hours each month, with word
processing, financial recording and analysis, as well as financial
budgeting the most important uses, the research said.
</P>
<P>
About 90 percent of computer-users believed that a computer is
an economic investment, it added.

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales in May Down in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Seasonally adjusted retail
sales in New Zealand fell 3.1 percent in May compared to that in
April, according to government statistics released here on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
This was the largest monthly fall in seasonally adjusted retail
sales since November 1997. The long-term trend for retail sales
had been nearly flat since mid-1996.
</P>
<P>
All store-types except department stores showed a seasonally
adjusted fall in sales, with motor vehicle retailing showing the
largest fall of 9 percent, followed by clothing and softgoods,
down 5.3 percent; and appliance retailing, down 4.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The fall in sales probably reflected a combination of low
levels of consumer and industry confidence, low levels of new car
registrations, low tourist arrival numbers, and declining
residential building activity, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
It said that actual retail sales were 3,157.3 million N.Z.
dollars (1,632.6 million U.S. dollars) in May, down 2 percent on
sales in May 1997. Motor vehicle retailing was the main
contributor to the actual change, 13 percent lower than a year
earlier.

</P>
<P>
Italian rates have been shaved throughout the week, bringing
them closer to the European average. Rates in the 11-nation Euro
zone are expected to converge around 4 percent by the end of the
year when the zone becomes operational.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, three-year Btp bonds dropped to 4.53
percent and the five-year variety fell to 4.56 percent. Both rates
were new minimums. Rates offered by commercial banks are following
the same downward curve. In June, their average rate was 7.89
percent, almost down to the 7.71 percent offered in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Financial observers pointed out that the commercial banks have
reduced rates even faster than the Bank of Italy. The last
discount rate cut was 0.5 percent, but from April 21 to now,
commercial bank rates have fallen by 0.62 percent.

<P>
DHAKA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government will
undertake a 1.01-billion-U.S.-dollar project to combat
malnutrition in the country, press reports here said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the project, the National Nutrition
Program already approved by the authority, will be taken up in
phases to cover the entire country within five years.
</P>
<P>
In order to ensure the smooth implementation of the project,
the Ministry of Health and Family will take up a scheme at the
same time by using its existing infrastructure and staff.
</P>
<P>
The project aims to reduce protein energy malnutrition and
micro-nutrition deficiencies and consequences, reduce maternal
malnutrition and low birth weight and improve children's
development and education attainment.
</P>
<P>
The implementation process of the project will include
prioritizing services focusing on pregnant and lactating woman
under two children.
</P>
<P>
Of the malnourished children aged six months to six years,
about 43 percent are stunted (chronically undernourished), about 8
percent were wasted (deficient in weight for height) and another 8
percent were concurrently stunted and wasted, according to a study
report released in February this year by the Bangladesh Bureau of
Statistics.

<HEADLINE> Italian PM Calls on Allies for Full Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi
Friday called on his parliamentary allies to grant their "full
support" to his government's rejigged policy platform in a
forthcoming vote of confidence.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want a 'critical' vote of confidence, but a full one
which would allow the government to govern," he told the Senate in
an opening debate speech. The debate will culminate early next
week in a vote of confidence.
</P>
<P>
The hard-left Communist Refoundation party has offered what it
calls 'critical' support, meaning it would continue to support the
government in principle but would reserve the right to criticize
it, and even vote against it on specific issues.
</P>
<P>
Prodi was asked by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro to "verify"
his government's parliamentary majority after the Communist
Refoundation deserted Prodi's alliance in a vote on North Atlantic
Treaty Organization expansion eastwards last month.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the upper house, Prodi outlined the policies
he had worked out in a bid to assure the continued support of the
range of parties supporting him, and most crucially, the Communist
Refoundation.
</P>
<P>
He said the government was committed to boost the southern
economy through tax breaks and the creation of a special agency to
coordinate development programs there.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed a commitment to introducing a 35-hour work
week and to continue promoting economic growth and a reduction of
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Speaking soon after Prodi's address, Communist Refoundation
leader Fausto Bertinotti appeared unenthusiastic. "I don't see any
embracing of real reforms," he said. "After we have evaluated
things more closely, I think we can offer 'critical' support".
</P>
<P>
During his speech, Prodi also turned his attention to the
political hot potato of the moment - the opposition's calls for a
commission of enquiry into claims of bribery and corruption,
dubbed "Tangentopoli."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said he was against any commission which
"put the Italian judiciary on trial."
</P>
<P>
He also attacked opposition leader Silvio Berlusconi for his
criticism of judges and prosecutors and his claims that they were
involved in a plot with the political left to erase him from the
political scene.
</P>
<P>
"We can in no way concur with the picture that the honorable
Berlusconi has painted in recent days regarding the work of the
judiciary," he said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Prodi's speech, Berlusconi said he found it
"disappointing."
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here speculated that, given its achievements
in the past two years and a present stable domestic situation, the
Prodi government would succeed in the coming confidence vote
scheduled on July 21.

<HEADLINE> Italians Trade In 1.5 Million Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Italians took advantage of state
incentives by trading in more than 1.5 million cars from January
1997 to June 1998, says a study released by the Automobile Club of
Italy (ACI) Friday.
</P>
<P>
With two months to go before the state incentives come to an
end, the ACI said public records showed 1,584,000 vehicles had
been traded in so far.
</P>
<P>
This amounted to more than 2.3 trillion lires, or 1.3 billion
U.S. dollars, in the form of state incentives. Car dealers got
discounts of more than 3.58 trillion lires, or 2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the June alone, 59,527 old cars had been got rid of and
another 71,390 new cars were registered. The ACI attributed the
difference to the fact that many car owners had not yet submitted
the request for trade-in incentives, which were to expire in 60
days.
</P>
<P>
The ACI said Italians bought 41,763 foreign cars, compared with
29,637 domestic ones.
</P>
<P>
Lombardy topped the regions in the list of cars traded in,
followed by Lazio, Sicily and Campania. The oldest cars to go were
from the 1960s, but most dated from 1984 to 1987.

<HEADLINE> 5 Islets in Jakarta Bay Disappear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Five islets of the Seribu Islands
(Thousand Islands) in north of Jakarta have disappeared in recent
years as a result of excessive sand mining, press reports said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The disappearance of Dapur, Air Kecil, Ubi, Gosong and Payung
Kecil islets has reduced the Seribu Islands to just 101 islets,
the report quoted legislator Saud Rahman as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Seribu Islands is a group of islands in the Bay of Jakarta.
There are actually less than 1,000 islands, and many of them
uninhabited. Some of the islands have been developed for tourism.
</P>
<P>
Rahman feared more islets and islands will disappear in the
future due to the lack of protection.
</P>
<P>
He said of the 101 remaining islets, only 11 are inhabited by
people, so the rest are highly susceptible to illegal sand mining.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the illegal mining commenced with the
construction of a toll road from Soekarno-Hatta International
Airport to Jakarta city a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
Rahman blamed the Jakarta city administration for failing to
check the over-exploitation of the islets.

<HEADLINE> Bank of Italy Cuts Reserves, Releases 12.3 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Italy Friday authorized
the country's commercial banks to cut the obligatory reserves they
are required to hold, bring them down from 9 percent to 6 percent
as of August 15.
</P>
<P>
Then, a further 22 trillion lire, or about 12.3 billion
U.S. dollars of liquidity, will be released into the system.
</P>
<P>
The Bank allowed the reserves to be cut from 15 percent to 9
percent on June 15, releasing 30 trillion lire. Analysts said the
impact will be much larger than the expected fall in the discount
rate. Some said the discount rate cut may now be postponed.
</P>
<P>
The central bank will retain control over this new flood of
liquidity through temporary financing operations in the banking
system, they added.
</P>
<P>
The decision is another step towards harmonization with other
countries in the Euro zone. The first official decision by the
European Central Bank (ECB) was to set the interest-paying
reserves required from the commercial banks at 1.5 to 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The move will ease the money supply, but analysts said it was
difficult to know how the banks would decide to use the new
liquidity in terms of granting loans, and the interest rates at
which they make them available, for house mortgages and company
financing.
</P>
<P>
The obligatory reserves are calculated on short-term deposits
held with banks and set a ceiling of funds the banks have to hold
as a security for the solvency.
</P>
<P>
Financial experts said the reduction in the reserve ceiling
will mean further savings for the banks since repo rate operations
will be reduced by the same amount. These fell below an average
rate of 5 percent Friday.
</P>
<P>
Despite the new cut, Italian obligatory reserves remain much
higher than in the rest of Europe. In France and Germany, they are
1.5 to 2 percent, and the European average is about 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
On July 7, The ECB said the 11 Euro zone countries would have
to converge around 1.5 to 2.5 percent by the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> Colombia to Privatize State-owned Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian government
plans to privatize several of its state-owned companies in 1999 to
generate about 2.5 trillion pesos (1.602 billion U.S. dollars) for
the country.
</P>
<P>
With this resource, the government could reduce almost to zero
the budget deficit projected for 1999, said Friday's La Republic
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Of the state-owned firms to be privatized, Carbocol is worth
450 million dollars; Urra 250 million; Isagen 833 million, and
several energy generating and distributing firms are worth 50
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The total of the projected funds represents 1.6 percent of the
gross domestic product (GDP), the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The incumbent Colombian government will end its mandate on
August 7.
</P>
<P>
According to projections of the Superior Council of Budget
Policy, the incoming government will be able, with other plans of
privatizing and dealing with foreign debts, to finance the total
deficit in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Central Government Reiterates Grain Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The General Office of the State
Council issued a circular today in a move to curb the malpractices
of some local grain administrations.
</P>
<P>
The circular reiterated central government policies on grain
purchases and marketing, and demanded stringent inspections and
supervision over related activities.
</P>
<P>
The circular points out that most provinces and regions are
carrying out reform of the grain marketing system and conducting
grain purchases in line with State Council decisions and
regulations, with related efforts leading to a gradual rise in
grain prices.
</P>
<P>
However, certain local grain administrations have turned a
blind eye to central government decrees and have wantonly
continued malpractices which have seriously infringed on the
interests of both farmers and the state.
</P>
<P>
The circular exposed irregularities on the part of some state
grain administrations in Heilongjiang, Hebei, Henan and Jiangsu
provinces. Irregularities cited include the fact that some
state-owned grain companies fail to purchase surplus grain from
farmers at protective prices and instead covertly set limits to
the amount of grain to be purchaseed; others offer various excuses
for withholding or refusing to pay the full amount due to farmers;
and still others divert state grain purchase funds for other
purposes and alter reports and accounts when seeking state
subsidies and purchase funds from state banks.
</P>
<P>
The circular reiterated the following central government
policies:
</P>
<P>
-- State grain policies must be strictly implemented. Grain
companies must not refuse to purchase surplus grain, withhold or
deduct payments from farmers under any pretext. They should also
promptly pay any money withheld from farmers.
</P>
<P>
-- Efforts must be made to improve the administration of grain
purchase market. State grain companies have the sole right to
purchase grain directly from farmers, and all other organizations,
units, private businesses and individuals are strictly prohibited
from engaging in related activities. Local industrial and
commercial departments should encourage and support normal grain
trading, grain processing and transportation.
</P>
<P>
-- Grain companies should refrain from attempting to purchase
grain from farmers at levels lower than state protective prices,
and are strictly prohibited from submitting false reports or
doctored accounts in pursuit of state subsidies.
</P>
<P>
-- Grain companies should sell grain at minimal profits and
should be responsible for their own profits and losses. Related
companies are prohibited from selling low price grain to units and
individuals, including friends and relatives.
</P>
<P>
-- Any attempts to defraud the State Grain Purchase Fund or
obtain loans from the Agricultural Development Bank of China
(ADBC) must be severely punished and the ADBC must strenghten
inspections of both funds and loans.
</P>
<P>
-- Government at all levels must intensify supervision and take
prompt and effective action to combat malpractices.

PRAGUE, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Czech President Vaclav Havel Friday
appointed Milos Zeman, the head of the Social Democrats, as the
new prime minister of the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
Zeman, 53, will name his new minority, center-left government
on Saturday. It is expected to have 19 members, 18 of them from
his own party, sources here said.
</P>
<P>
Havel, in a ceremony at Prague Castle, asked Josef Tosovsky's
caretaker government to remain in office until the new Social
Democrat cabinet was appointed.
</P>
<P>
Zeman's party topped the poll at last month's parliamentary
election, which was called two years early after the center-right
administration of former Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus collapsed
last November. Tosovsky's interim government has been in power
since January.
</P>
<P>
"I am aware that the new government is entering a difficult
situation, a situation characterized by a drop in economic
performance, lowering of living standards and growing
unemployment," Zeman told the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Zeman, a former economic forecaster, has been the party's
chairman since 1993, and became Czech parliament speaker in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Armed Forces Chief Warns Against Looting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Armed Forces (ABRI)
Commander General Wiranto warned that the military would take
stern action against looters following a spate of looting that
took place in several areas of the country this week, press
reports said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with President B.J. Habibie at the State Guest
House here on Friday, Wiranto said Indonesia needs national
stability if both local and foreign confidence in the country is
to be restored.
</P>
<P>
"That's why looting is intolerable," said Wiranto, who is also
Minister of Defense and Security.
</P>
<P>
The minister revealed that he summoned all 10 regional military
commanders to Jakarta on Friday and gave them clear orders to
contain the rising crime rates in their respective areas.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto acknowledged that many people have been impoverished by
the economic crisis, with some losing their jobs and others even
driven to the verge of starvation.
</P>
<P>
But these conditions should not be used as a pretext to break
the law, he said, adding that the government has been working hard
to resolve the problem of starvation through social movements, and
"not by allowing people to steal."
</P>
<P>
Lawlessness appears to have become the order of the day in some
parts of the country with the economic crisis biting deeper and
deeper.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that hundreds of people looted foodstuffs,
electronic goods and spare parts from shops and kiosks in Jember,
220 kilometers southeast of the country's second largest city of
Surabaya in East Java.
</P>
<P>
In Banyuwangi, about 400 kilometers southeast of Surabaya,
thousands of villagers have been plundering coffee beans from
plantations.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, nearly 2,000 villagers plundered a shrimp pond in
Tangerang in west of Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has been the worst hit by the regional currency
turmoil with the rupiah losing over 80 percent of its value
against the U.S. dollar since July last year.
</P>
<P>
The economic crisis has resulted in soaring prices and
unemployment rate, hitting the poor and the needy.
</P>
<P>
According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, the number of
poor people in the country has increased from 22.5 million in 1996
to 79.4 million now. The figures could increase to 95.8 million,
or about 48 percent of the total population of 202 million by the
end of this year because no economic recovery is in sight.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Mt. Merapi Continues to Undergo tremors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Merapi volcano in Central
Java, Indonesia, underwent continuous tremors for 15 minutes and
spewed hot fumes seven times early Friday, said reports available
here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The hot fumes drifted in the direction of the Lamat and Sat
rivers, the reports quoted Djilal, a seismic officer at the
Yogyakarta office of the Volcanology Directorate as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
The hot fumes were accompanied by ashes that eventually rained
on some parts of Magelang district, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mount Merapi erupted on July 11, spilling out hot fumes and
ashes and the local authorities have to maintain a "Merapi alert"
state of readiness. The alert status meant that people living near
the mountain had to be prepared to move to safer places any time.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, people living in areas close to the mountain were
still seen carrying out their daily activities Friday despite of
the ash rains. Many of them wore protective masks when doing
outdoor jobs, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
Merapi, 2,968-meter high and one the most active volcanoes in
Indonesia, last erupted in November 1994, killing at least 60
people.

<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Surging floods in the Yangtze
river have cut off the waterway at the Three Gorges for nearly two
weeks and forced local authorities to divert 120,000 passengers by
buses.
</P>
<P>
Since July 2, floods at the Three Gorges at the middle reaches
of the Yangtze river have risen twice to a level higher than the
safety level for passenger shipping. Flood flow peaked at 56,000
cubic meters per second at the site of the Three Gorges Dam on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the past 12 days, 726 ships have been blocked at ports up
the Three Gorges as local navigation authorities sealed the
waterway.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the construction company of the Three Gorges
Dam, the local government dispatched 4,700 buses to divert a
total of 120,000 passengers from these ports.
</P>
<P>
An local government official said that pressure of diverting
stranded passengers will continue to increase because flood levels
at the river are forecast to rise further in the next three days.

<HEADLINE> Latvian PM Proposes Vote Over Nationality Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Latvian Prime Minister
Guntars Krasts proposed a referendum here on Friday to settle the
dispute arising from Latvia's revised nationality law.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference with his Finnish counterpart, Paavo
Lipponen, after their talks, Krasts said a referendum was the
"best way" to resolve such dispute.
</P>
<P>
The Latvian parliament last month adopted the amended
nationality law, which stipulates that children, born after the
1991 independence, can be given Latvian nationality.
</P>
<P>
The revised law would help improve the status of the Russian
minority in Latvia.
</P>
<P>
However, the revised law brought heavy opposition from the
Union for Fatherland and Freedom and other parties, and has not
come into effect so far.
</P>
<P>
The amendment of Latvia's nationality law is one of the
requirements which the country must meet to join the European
Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Lipponen said it was important for Finland and other EU member
states to back Latvia's EU accession process. He praised Latvia's
achievements in several fields.
</P>
<P>
Krasts thanked the Northern European countries for their
support, and said he hoped the EU would open its market for
Latvia's farm produce.
</P>
<P>
Krasts arrived here Wednesday for a four-day visit.

<HEADLINE> Gingrich Seeks Talks on Health Plan Legislation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Newt Gingrich, speaker of the
House of Representatives, made an overture on Friday to the
largest United States doctors' group, which is lending high
profile support to a White House-endorsed proposal to regulate
health plans.
</P>
<P>
The American Medical Association (AMA) is planning a "fly-in"
of doctors from across the country to Washington on Tuesday. They
will meet with lawmakers and urge their support of a "patients'
bill of rights" championed by congressional Democrats and
President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Republican lawmakers in the House on Thursday introduced rival
legislation which they said would protect patients against health
plan abuses, but without as much new government regulations and
more lawsuits. Gingrich has said he wants to pass new laws before
this fall's congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
"As you are aware, Congress is at a crossroads on patient
protection legislation," the speaker said in a letter Friday to
AMA President, Dr. Nancy W. Dickey.
</P>
<P>
"I am writing to request that the first stop you make on your
Washington, D.C. fly-in next week will be to my office for an
important meeting with me to discuss the future of health care and
legislation pending in Congress."
</P>
<P>
A family physician from College Station, Texas, and the AMA's
first woman president, Dickey hosted a roundtable discussion with
patients and doctors which Clinton attended Wednesday, in the
association's Washington office.
</P>
<P>
The AMA chairman, Dr. Randolph D. Smoak, accompanied Clinton to
a rally with Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill Thursday.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The 160-nation conference here later

<P>
During the conference, 120 countries voted for the ICC, while
seven voted against and 21 abstained. Twelve did not take part in
the vote.
</P>

<P>
The court will be set up in The Hague once the statute is
ratified by 60 countries.

<P>
The court will judge war crimes, genocide, crimes against
humanity and the crime of aggression.

<HEADLINE> Romania Has Privileged Political Ties With Israel: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The political links between
Romania and Israel are privileged and the economic, commercial
exchanges as well as ties in other fields must be intensified too,
said Prime Minister Radu Vasile Friday.
</P>
<P>
While receiving visiting Israeli Minister of Public Security
Avigdor Kahalani, the prime minister said the relations between
bodies in the two countries in charge of public order and domestic
security should be institutionalized.
</P>
<P>
The two countries had common targets such as fighting organized
crime, drug trafficking, illegal traffic of goods and people and
their achievement necessitated bilateral and international
cooperation, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The links between Israel and Romania are exceptional," the
guest said, adding that the two countries had much in common and
many objectives to fulfill together in various fields.
</P>

<HEADLINE> UK Blood to Be Treated to Prevent CJD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Britain's blood supplies are to be
treated to minimize the risks of transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob
Disease (CJD), the human form of "mad cow" disease (BSE).
</P>
<P>
The government made the announcement Friday following a
recommendation from the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory
Committee (SEAC), the body of experts which advises on BSE and
CJD.
</P>
<P>
The SEAC committee believes that there is a "theoretical risk"
that the agent which causes CJD could be passed through blood
product and it calls for the introduction of leukodepletion, a
blood purification system which removes white cells.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Health Department said it was considering
the SEAC's recommendations, but it was important to remember there
was no risk of getting CJD by donating blood.
</P>
<P>
Frank Dobson, secretary of state for health, is confirmed to be
considering advice on whether he should act to prevent that a
blood donor might have CJD, a remote possibility estimated to be
40 million to one.
</P>
<P>
Of 25 known British victims who have died of CJD, three were
blood donors. There is no screening procedure for the disease.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Emergency Post-Conflict Aid for Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) Friday announced the approval of a loan of about 10 million
dollars for Congo under the IMF's emergency post-conflict
assistance to support the government's economic program for 1998.
</P>
<P>
The main macroeconomic objectives of the 1998 program are to
resume non-oil economic growth, lower inflation, reduce the
external current account deficit as a ratio of GDP, and regularize
external arrears. Real non-oil GDP is projected to increase by 2.5
percent in 1998, while the 12-month consumer price inflation rate
is targeted to decline to 1.1 percent this year from 13.1 percent
in 1997. The external current account deficit, excluding grants,
is programmed to fall to 12.4 percent of GDP in 1998, from 13.2
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The Republic of Congo joined the IMF in July 1963. Its quota is
some 77 million dollars and its outstanding use of IMF financing
currently totals about 27 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Congress Puts off Vote on Iran Sanctions Veto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Congress Friday
postponed a showdown vote on President Bill Clitnon's veto of a
bill that would impose tough sanctions on foreign firms selling
missile technology to Iran.
</P>
<P>
The bill, called athe Iran Missile Sanctions Act, passed in the
House 393-22 and in the Senate 90-4. But Clinton vetoes the bill
on June 23.
</P>
<P>
The White House had asked Congress to delay the vote to
override Clinton's June 23 veto of the Iran Missile Sanctions Act,
saying it would interfere with their progress in persuading Russia
to set up an export control program stopping sales of missile
technology to Iran.
</P>
<P>
So the vote was canceled in order to give more time to see what
progress the Russian government makes in its probes of firms and
other entities accused of selling technologies to Iran that could
be adapted to military uses.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to wait and see how the Russians behave," said an
aide of Republican lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
But Ben Gilman, chairman of the House International Relations
Committee, said the vote would be held later if Congress was
dissatisfied with the progress of the investigation by Russia's
commission on export controls. Moscow announced the investigation
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Congress decision to withhold acting on Clinton's veto came
after a meeting earlier in the week between National Security
Adviser Sandy Berger and House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate
Majority leader Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that Lott still wanted to go ahead with a vote but
that Gingrich was more interested in accommodating the
administration and believed that withholding an override vote
would give the United States additional leverage over Russia.

<HEADLINE> UK Blood to Be Treated to Prevent CJD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Britain's blood supplies are to be
treated to minimize the risks of transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob
Disease (CJD), the human form of "mad cow" disease (BSE).
</P>
<P>
The government made the announcement Friday following a
recommendation from the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory
Committee (SEAC), the body of experts which advises on BSE and
CJD.
</P>
<P>
The SEAC committee believes that there is a "theoretical risk"
that the agent which causes CJD could be passed through blood
product and it calls for the introduction of leukodepletion, a
blood purification system which removes white cells.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Health Department said it was considering
the SEAC's recommendations, but it was important to remember there
was no risk of getting CJD by donating blood.
</P>
<P>
Frank Dobson, secretary of state for health, is confirmed to be
considering advice on whether he should act to prevent that a
blood donor might have CJD, a remote possibility estimated to be
40 million to one.
</P>
<P>
Of 25 known British victims who have died of CJD, three were
blood donors. There is no screening procedure for the disease.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Emergency Post-Conflict Aid for Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) Friday announced the approval of a loan of about 10 million
dollars for Congo under the IMF's emergency post-conflict
assistance to support the government's economic program for 1998.
</P>
<P>
The main macroeconomic objectives of the 1998 program are to
resume non-oil economic growth, lower inflation, reduce the
external current account deficit as a ratio of GDP, and regularize
external arrears. Real non-oil GDP is projected to increase by 2.5
percent in 1998, while the 12-month consumer price inflation rate
is targeted to decline to 1.1 percent this year from 13.1 percent
in 1997. The external current account deficit, excluding grants,
is programmed to fall to 12.4 percent of GDP in 1998, from 13.2
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The Republic of Congo joined the IMF in July 1963. Its quota is
some 77 million dollars and its outstanding use of IMF financing
currently totals about 27 million dollars.
