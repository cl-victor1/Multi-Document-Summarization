   BEIJING _ In preparing to receive Bill Clinton, Chinese
authorities have outmaneuvered the White House on several points.
Will the Chinese similarly have the upper hand when the critical
issues of Tiananmen, Taiwan and trade are discussed?
</P>
<P>
   American, Chinese, Japanese and Taiwanese political observers
suggest that the White House has acquiesced because no one in the
administration's top level has had much experience in negotiating
with China.
</P>
<P>
   Said a Chinese scholar: ``The Clinton people are not aware of
how the Chinese will manipulate this visit. They don't have a
clue.''
</P>
<P>
   Sighed an American official with long experience in Asia:
``Clinton's going to kowtow all over Beijing.''
</P>
<P>
   American business executives in Beijing, initially eager to take
part in the visit, say they are backing away now because they fear
that the president will agree to a deal that will come under
critical scrutiny in Asia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   An assessment of traps awaiting Clinton in China can be pieced
together from officials and private analysts.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese, for whom symbolism is all-important, persuaded
Clinton to move his trip forward from November to June, the
anniversary month of the Tiananmen episode in which the Chinese
army killed uncounted hundreds of democratic activists in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese plan to have Clinton's appearance in Tiananmen
Square help to bring symbolic closure to that sorry chapter in
China's history.
</P>
<P>
   At first the White House said he could not go before the
November midterm elections. Then political heat got turned up by
potential scandals, and White House officials arranged to get him
out of Washington in March to Africa, in April to Latin America, in
May to Europe, and now in June to China.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese demanded that the president come directly from
Washington to China and return home without stopping in Japan,
which is supposedly the key ally of the United States in Asia. Most
U.S. presidents have stopped in Tokyo on visits to Asia for the
past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton officials said the president had planned to stop over in
Tokyo on this trip. The Chinese insisted that because President
Jiang went directly to America and back last year, Clinton should
do the same.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese have induced Clinton to spend nine days in China,
far more time than seasoned diplomats can remember a U.S. president
taking for a visit before.
</P>
<P>
   President Jiang Zemin spent the same time in America last fall,
and Clinton's visit is intended to show that he considers Jiang to
be his equal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton visits Hong Kong, he will not have a separate
meeting with Martin Lee, in deference to Chinese wishes. Lee and 19
other democrats recently won election to the Hong Kong legislature
dominated by Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian and Pakistani nuclear explosions, which have drawn
worldwide criticism, have been added to the agenda, much to China's
pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan is closely allied with Beijing, and Clinton risks being
seen as lining up with autocratic China and Pakistan against
democratic India.
</P>
<P>
   Americans experienced in Asia express concern over how Clinton's
visit will be seen in Japan and the rest of Asia. They fear that he
will serve Beijing's crusade to revive the concept of the Middle
Kingdom, in which China is Asia's dominant power.
</P>
<P>
   Not that President Jiang will have a free hand with Clinton. The
Chinese leader must quell a raging debate between leaders of the
People's Liberation Army, who demand that China confront the United
States, and the foreign and economic ministries, which see good
relations with America to be in China's interest.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang cannot afford to anger senior military officers, who hold
the key to power in Beijing and take a hard line on Taiwan.
Military leaders have called Chinese diplomats ``traitors'' for
what they consider a soft attitude toward the United States.
</P>
<P>
   So Clinton can expect tough words about Taiwan. Chinese leaders
have said repeatedly that the future of Taiwan is the most
important core issue in relations between China and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans appear to agree that good relations with China
are in the U.S. national interest. The question is whether Clinton
is going about it in the right way. &QL;

MAN INVESTIGATED IN SLAYING HELPS CATCH SUSPECT POLICE SAY IS REAL
KILLER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY LISA VAN PROYEN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Afraid he'd go to jail for a crime he didn't
commit, Cesar Quintero did the impossible: He found the man police
say is the real killer.
</P>
<P>
   It looked bad for Quintero: four eyewitnesses identified him as
the Mother's Day killer of Steven Redden; he drove a red Fiero like
the one the suspect fled the scene in and a collection of knives
was found in his home. Prosecutors decided the evidence was
insufficient and police were still investigating him.
</P>
<P>
   And then a red Fiero virtually identical to his drove into the
quick oil-change auto shop where he worked and out stepped a man
who looked remarkably like him. Cool as anything, the 19-year-old
Quintero jotted down the license number for police and changed the
man's oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared,'' Quintero said Wednesday between servicing cars
at the shop in the Los Angeles suburb of Canoga Park. ``For two
weeks, I was terrified. There's not too many Hispanics, chubby guys
like me driving Fieros.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to be locked up forever for something I didn't
do. I was just thinking, let justice do good!''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were amazed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all the years I've worked homicide, I've never seen this
happen,'' said Detective Ron Vega of the Los Angeles Police
Department. ``If you've never believed in divine intervention, I
guess you have to believe it now. Somebody was watching him
upstairs.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, detectives thought it was an action to outwit them.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are the odds for him to run into the actual suspects?''
Vega said. ``He told me, `He not only drives the same car, but
looks like me.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``You gotta figure a guy who's facing murder charges is going to
call me.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was for real.
</P>
<P>
   Police traced the license plate and arrested Edgar Adolfo
Barrientos, 20, on suspicion of murder and his brother, Giovanni
Contreras, 24, on suspicion of battery.
</P>
<P>
   Barrientos pleaded not guilty Wednesday to murdering Redden, a
21-year-old North Hollywood man stabbed in a fight May 10 at a
Wienerschnitzel restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Contreras was released, with no charges filed because his fight
with Redden's 17-year-old friend was determined to be mutual
combat.
</P>
<P>
   Quintero's cousin, Rogelio Galindo, 21, also had been under
investigation, but police now say Quintero's actions have cleared
him of any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel relieved,'' Quintero said. ``I feel like everything is
off my chest. I feel like I did a good thing for me and my
cousin.''
</P>
<P>
   An artist's drawing and sophisticated computer-generated
printouts by police of most of the Fieros in L.A.'s San Fernando
Valley led to Quintero and his cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there was always an element of doubt that they were the
suspects, Vega said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He comes from a good family,'' he said. ``In our hearts, we
always felt that these guys were not the suspects. We turned as
many stones as we could.''
</P>
<P>
   Just days before a polygraph test was scheduled, Quintero, who
says he celebrated Mother's Day at a barbecue at home with his
family, saw the red Fiero pull into his bay with a driver who
looked a lot like him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking, that's the guy,'' he said. ``He was a chubby
guy, my height, my same style haircut and tan. I knew right away it
was him. I wrote the license down and put it in my wallet.''
</P>
<P>
   Detectives followed up on the tip, which led them to the 8300
block of Willis Avenue in the L.A. suburb of Panorama City, where
they found Barrientos and Contreras, who fit the description of the
suspect and his accomplice, respectively, and were leaving the
apartment complex.
</P>
<P>
   At the police station, they were placed in separate rooms and
Barrientos gave an admission, Vega said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I poked my head into one room and Barrientos said, `Hey, I
know why I'm here' and referenced the fight,'' Vega said. ``The
guys basically both copped-out to the murder.''
</P>
<P>
   The intense two-week investigation that zeroed in on Quintero
was a major upset for his entire family, including his sister who
recalled a room full of dozens of officers interrogating the family
during a search of their home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time, we cooperated,'' his sister Esmeralda Quintero
said. `` The second time, they came in with a search warrant. We
were all in pajamas. They brought my cousin out in handcuffs in
front of the kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought maybe they're just blaming somebody. They said that
he was their No. 1 suspect,'' she said. ``But I knew my brother
didn't do it.'' &QL;

Lewis feels betrayed by Rockets
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By MICHAEL MURPHY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ Many people tried to talk Rashard
Lewis out of his dream of going straight from Elsik High School to
the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Those people wanted Lewis to instead go to school and get an
education.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Lewis feels he got his education Wednesday night, courtesy
of the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who fell out of the first round and was finally taken by
Seattle with the 32nd pick in the annual NBA draft, left General
Motors Place with tears in his eyes and talking about how he had
been lied to by the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lewis, the Rockets promised him that they would
take the 6-10 forward if he were still available with one of
Houston's three first-round picks _ No. 14, 16 or 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me they would take me if I was still there,'' Lewis
said of the Rockets. ``I was still there at 14, but they didn't
take me at 14, or 16, so it didn't really cross my mind that they
really would take me at 18. If they wanted to take me, they would
have taken me.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did tell me that they would pick me, but you can't trust
anyone's words these days.''
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to tell if Lewis was speaking from the standpoint of
an 18-year-old who had just gone through the most disappointing few
hours of his life, or if he actually had a beef with the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich disputed Lewis' version of their
talks but understood where the youngster might have gotten the
wrong impression from the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did tell him that we liked him and that we couldn't make any
promises,'' Tomjanovich said. ``But I did tell him we liked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll admit this: He was the fourth guy on our list. If one of
our top three guys was gone, we were going to take him. We liked
him, and we think he has a very good future.
</P>
<P>
   ``But those were the top three guys we had penciled in for our
team and our needs. We thought we'd end up with Lewis because one
of those guys was going to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets instead took Arizona shooting guard Michael
Dickerson with their 14th pick, Valparaiso point guard Bryce Drew
at No. 16 and Turkish forward Mirsad Turkcan at No. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Of those three, only Turkcan, who flew himself in for the draft,
was in the NBA green room behind the stage at General Motors Place.
But Lewis was there, hobnobbing with several other anxious players.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, the prospects filed out when their names were
called, striding to the podium to receive a logo cap from the team
that selected them and to shake the hand of NBA commissioner David
Stern.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the second round of the draft rolled around, Lewis
was the only player left, meaning there would be no guaranteed
three-year contract, which comes with being a first-round pick.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of disappointment is hard to hide, especially since
TNT, which televised the event nationally, kept cutting to Lewis,
alone in the green room, showing emotions he was obviously feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very emotional,'' said Lewis, explaining the tears he
couldn't hold back. ``Just being selected in the NBA really did
bring tears in my eyes. Knowing that I was supposed to go in the
first round but went in the second round also brought tears to my
eyes, but that makes me want to work even harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was still confident the whole way through (that he would be
drafted), even though I had to sit back there and wait. My family
just kept telling me, `Don't worry about it. The only thing you can
do is just step in the league and make a big impact. Go out there
and work hard, then you can prove everyone (who didn't draft him)
is wrong.' That's what I'm going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Being taken by Seattle means Lewis will see the Rockets at least
four times a season, not counting the playoffs. And according to
Lewis, that's four times he can show the Rockets what they missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seattle is in the same conference as the Rockets,'' Lewis
said. ``Once we come into Houston to play, I will go out there to
show them what I can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little disappointed, but I'm not that much disappointed.
I'm very happy to go to Seattle. I've heard it's a great city. I'm
going to go out there and work hard. I have a heart bigger than
Texas, and I'm just looking forward to working real hard so I can
be able to go out there and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is already learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone would learn from this experience,'' Lewis said. ``I
learned that people tell you one thing, you see one thing in the
books or you see another thing, but some things may be true and
other things may not be true.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no regrets at all. I made the decision, and now I have
to step forward and continue on with that decision. I'm going to be
out there every day. Starting tomorrow, I'm going to be in the gym
working out.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The announcement Wednesday that AT&AMP;T would acquire the nation's
No. 2 cable television company, Tele-Communications Inc., for $31.8
billion in stock drew an initially favorable response from
regulators but a concerned reaction on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   In the most ambitious result yet of Congress's 1996 deregulation
of the telecommunications industry, the two companies said they
wanted to begin selling digital phone and data service over the
cable system by the end of next year but would not commit on
Wednesday to a firm timetable. The companies said they would begin
to bundle and jointly market each other's existing services even
before the deal closes.
</P>
<P>
   The hectic pace of communications mergers has raised hackles on
Capitol Hill and at the Federal Communications Commission. But the
commission's chairman, William Kennard, approached the AT&AMP;T
announcement with an encouraging attitude on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``These companies bring some synergies that are quite
compelling,'' he said in an interview. ``They're not direct
head-to-head competitors but both of them have said in the past
that they want to offer a package of services to consumers. If
through the combination they are able to bundle services and be
more competitive with the incumbent providers, it's a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the regional Bell companies that would face competition
from AT&AMP;T in areas served by TCI's cable system found something
positive in the deal _ another argument for why the government
should let them into the long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   But investors were less enthusiastic. AT&AMP;T's shares fell $5.375
Wednesday, to $60, on fears that the company's stock would be
diluted in the deal and on concerns that AT&AMP;T may be moving rashly.
Investors were also turned off by the complexity of the deal and by
the fact that many financial details remained undetermined.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the deal, AT&AMP;T will also assume TCI's debt of
about $11 billion. The 31.8 billion purchase price also does not
include $5.5 billion in cash AT&AMP;T will pay to repurchase shares
AT&AMP;T issued to TCI in a previous transaction and to acquire its
interest in a cable-modem venture that delivers high-speed Internet
data over television cables. But in announcing the deal, the
companies added to their calculation of the value, for a total of
$48.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Combining AT&AMP;T's financial muscle and nation-spanning
communications network with TCI's wires into millions of homes
would create a communications behemoth with a reach unrivaled since
AT&AMP;T spun off its local phone operations in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, behemoths in general are not what they used to be in
the communications industry. Since the Telecommunications Act of
1996 was signed two years ago, huge mergers have become almost
common in the industry, with the seven Bell local phone companies
agreeing to become four and MCI Communications Corp. making a deal
to be acquired by Worldcom Inc. for $37 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But a deal between AT&AMP;T and TCI could be the first to make a
concrete difference in how everyday consumers purchase and use
communications services. By giving AT&AMP;T an electronic path into
millions of homes and apartments, the acquisition could create
vibrant competition in the market for local telephone service for
the first time since AT&AMP;T's predecessor was led by Alexander Graham
Bell.
</P>
<P>
   TCI and its affiliates have run wires past about a third of the
nation's households. So even after acquiring the cable giant, AT&AMP;T
would not have a clear path into the local market for most of the
nation's consumers. And it is not entirely clear how difficult and
expensive it will be to adapt TCI's cable networks, which are
generally designed to transmit information in only one direction,
for use in two-way data and voice communications.
</P>
<P>
   But that is what C. Michael Armstrong, who took over as AT&AMP;T's
chairman just last November, intends to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this doesn't deliver on the promise of the telecom act of
'96, I've just missed my bet,'' he said in an interview Wednesday.
Armstrong said he was sending a message to the Bell companies,
which dominate the local phone business: ``We intend to show up.
Also, many in Washington had some doubt that AT&AMP;T was serious about
pursuing the $110 billion local exchange business, and this mutes
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The regional Bell companies, meanwhile, used the deal as an
opportunity to press regulators to allow them into the
long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   ``In light of this news, federal regulators need to act swiftly
to drop restrictions that are keeping US West from fully serving
customers in markets such as long distance and data networking,''
US West Media Group, which, like TCI, is based in Denver, said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   At the FCC, Kennard added that his review would hinge on the
details of the companies' plans, which he had not yet seen. But his
positive comments were very different from the reaction AT&AMP;T
received the last time it tried to break into local markets through
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   After news emerged last summer that AT&AMP;T was negotiating to
acquire SBC Communications, the Bell company that provides local
phone service in much of the West, Reed Hundt, then the
commission's chairman, called such a deal ``unthinkable.''
</P>
<P>
   TCI had a preliminary agreement to be acquired by Bell Atlantic
Corp. in 1993, but those talks fell apart amid antitrust concerns.
The two common communications pipelines into homes are the phone
wire and the cable television wire. By acquiring TCI, Bell Atlantic
would have eliminated a potential competitor.
</P>
<P>
   But AT&AMP;T has minimal presence in local markets, and by acquiring
TCI it could potentially become a more formidable competitor
against its former subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Washington office of
Consumers Union, a consumer advocacy group, said the deal held
promise but added a note of skepticism about AT&AMP;T's intentions of
competing for local phone business.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the deal that is the make-it-or-break-it for the
telecom act,'' he said. ``This is the first proposal for
cross-industry competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Using industry shorthand for telephone calls, he added: ``Every
effort to use the cable wire for telephony has been less than
successful. I'm concerned that AT&AMP;T maybe is buying the cable cash
cow and milking it for profits and hoping _ hoping _ that it can be
used for telephony.''
</P>
<P>
   TCI is in the first phase of a $1.7 billion project to upgrade
its networks to offer advanced service. But Malone said that TCI
had little chance to buy the asset it needs most for the future: a
widely recognized brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a strong, well-established communications brand our
penetration with these sorts of services would be adversely
affected,'' Malone said. ``It would be virtually impossible for my
company to construct a brand on our own to enter that space.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why all TCI services will be sold under the AT&AMP;T name.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, holders of TCI Series A stock would
receive .7757 shares of AT&AMP;T. Holders of the cable companies'
Series B stock, including Malone, would receive .8533 shares of
AT&AMP;T stock.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T expects to finish the deal in the first half next year. The
company said the acquisition would dilute its earnings for the
first two years after the deal's completion and add to its earnings
after that.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Malone would join AT&AMP;T's board and remain chairman of Liberty
Media, TCI's programming wing, which would remain under his control
even as its stock became a so-called tracking stock of AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T would fold TCI's cable assets into its consumer business
and spin off that unit as another tracking stock. John Zeglis,
AT&AMP;T's president, would become chairman of the consumer unit while
Leo Hindery, TCI's president, would become the unit's chief
operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong would remain at the helm of the AT&AMP;T parent company,
which would retain the company's network operation and the units
that sell services to business customers and other communications
carriers.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for a AT&AMP;T and TCI combination started last November
when Armstrong visited Malone to discuss ways the two companies
could work together, the two men said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies began final negotiations just last Tuesday,
they said. Several days ago, a small team of executives from both
companies holed up with their advisers to hammer out the details of
an agreement, said a person close to those talks. By Monday,
Armstrong and Malone were spending long hours at the offices of
AT&AMP;T's law firm, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &AMP; Katz, in face-to-face
meetings hashing out the final details.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month AT&AMP;T held preliminary discussions with
America Online Inc., the No. 1 provider of access to cyberspace,
about a merger between the two companies, but America Online was
not interested in such a deal.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Wachtell law firm, AT&AMP;T was advised in the
negotiations by Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. and by Credit Suisse First
Boston. Tele-Communications was advised by Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette and by the law firms of Baker &AMP; PBotts, Sherman &AMP; Howard
and Richards, Layton &AMP; Fingers.

   Clippers start unexpected moves by taking Olowokandi over Bibby
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By MICHAEL MURPHY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ The Los Angeles Clippers had talked
so long about how they needed a point guard, casting loving eyes
toward Arizona's Michael Bibby, rated the best point guard in the
NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby, Bibby, Bibby was all you heard coming out of the
Clippers' front office. So sure was Bibby of being selected by the
Clippers that he didn't work out for any other team. Not only was
Bibby a great point guard, but he was a local legend, the son of
Henry Bibby, who quarterbacked UCLA to three NCAA championships in
the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   It was a natural.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, all that talk turned out to be little more than
Clip service.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers decided to pass up a good thing, instead settling
on potential greatness in 7-0 center Michael Olowokandi with the
first pick in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   So much for all the projections, mock drafts and projected
needs.
</P>
<P>
   Need a point guard? Draft a center. Sure, it works.
</P>
<P>
   But while the center-stage podium at the draft is usually the
final destination on most players' minds, it might not be the last
stop for Olowokandi.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors circulating around General Motors Place on Wednesday
night had the Clippers shipping Olowokandi out in a trade. Even
Olowokandi hinted he might not be in Los Angeles long.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were to give my opinion (as to why he was taken by the
Clippers), I think it would be because they figured they could
(draft) me and get something better later on,'' said Olowokandi,
who averaged 22 points and 11 rebounds for Pacific last season. ``I
don't know. Or draft me and have me improve after a season or so.
Like (Clippers general manager) Elgin Baylor said, there is a lack
of available centers in the league right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibby didn't have to wait long before hearing his name, going to
Vancouver with the second pick. It was a selection that earned a
standing ovation from the crowd at General Motors Place, home of
the Grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just looking forward to getting drafted,'' said Bibby,
trying his best to not sound disappointed. ``I had no idea where I
was going to go. There was nothing I could do, and nothing I could
control. I didn't know what to expect. Me being No. 1 was just a
lot of talk and rumor, so I didn't expect anything.''
</P>
<P>
   That was certainly the way to approach this year's draft, since
surprise was the order of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver Nuggets, who had been talking about selecting Kansas
swingman Paul Pierce, instead slipped their logo cap on Jayhawks
forward Raef LaFrentz with the third pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm going to play center at all, I have to get into the
weight room and continue to do a lot of hard work, put a lot more
weight and muscle on my frame,'' said the 6-11 LaFrentz. ``But I
think I can definitely do so.''
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina teammates Antawn Jamison and Vince Carter went
with the next two picks, to Toronto and Golden State, respectively.
The two then promptly exchanged hats in a deal that sent Jamison to
the Warriors in exchange for Carter and ``an extra consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas scooped up Robert ``Tractor'' Traylor with the sixth
pick, setting up a three-way trade involving Dallas and Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The deal sent Traylor to Milwaukee for German forward Dirk
Nowitzki and Notre Dame power forward Pat Garrity, selected by
Milwaukee with the ninth and 19th picks, respectively. The
Mavericks then shipped Garrity, next year's first-round pick,
Martin Muursepp and Bubba Wells to Phoenix for guard Steve Nash.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 7 pick proved to be one of the biggest surprises, with
Sacramento selecting Florida point guard Jason Williams. Williams,
a tremendous ball-handler and passer, was highly rated, but his
often boneheaded attitude (he was kicked off the team at Florida
last season and suspended twice before that) had many general
managers turned off.
</P>
<P>
   It was thought that the Kings would be looking for a shooting
guard, like Larry Hughes, to replace Mitch Richmond, who had been
traded to Washington. Hughes instead went to Philadelphia at No. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee selected Nowitzki with the ninth pick, but he was
shipped out in the Dallas deal.
</P>
<P>
   A very happy Boston organization had Pierce, who just a few days
ago was a sure bet to go among the top three or four picks, land
squarely in its lap at No. 10. Pierce, who has been projected for
stardom by no less than Magic Johnson, gives the Celtics another
full-court, inside-outside threat to go with Antoine Walker and Ron
Mercer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a little disappointed, but it's a situation I had no
control over,'' said Pierce, who averaged 20.4 points at Kansas
last season. ``I am going to use this as motivation and show these
teams (that passed him over) that they should have picked me. But
I'm happy that (Celtics coach Rick) Pitino felt confident in my
ability and gave me a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Ball State shooting guard Bonzi Wells (No. 11, to Detroit), Utah
center Michael Doleac (No. 12, to Orlando) and UNLV power forward
Keon Clark (No. 13, to Orlando) rounded out the lottery picks.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando added Georgia Tech's Matt Harpring at No. 15 for the
last of its three first-round picks. The Rockets were the other
team with three first-rounders, snapping up Arizona shooting guard
Michael Dickerson at No. 14, Valparaiso point guard Bryce Drew at
16 and then Mirsad Turkcan, a 6-9 power forward from Turkey, at No.
18.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Turkcan underscored how far the high school
prospects had slipped in the draft. Elsik's Rashard Lewis, New
Jersey's Al Harrington and Virginia's Korleone Young all took large
falls.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington was the first of the trio be selected, going to
Indiana at No. 25, while Lewis fell out of the first round
entirely, eventually winding up with Seattle with the 32nd pick.
Young was taken by Detroit at No. 40.

ADMIRAL, A SUICIDE, WINS SOME VINDICATION ON COMBAT AWARDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two years after the Navy's ranking officer, Adm.
Jeremy Boorda, committed suicide amid scrutiny over his right to
wear two combat decorations, the Navy has given him a measure of
vindication.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary of the Navy, John Dalton, has inserted into
Boorda's official record a letter from the former commander of the
Navy, Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr., declaring that Boorda was eligible
to wear the decorations for his service aboard two warships during
the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Dalton's decision is being reported in the July issue of
Washingtonian magazine, which comes out on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Boorda, the chief of naval operations, shot himself outside his
home in Washington in May 1996 only hours before he was to be
interviewed by reporters from Newsweek investigating whether he had
earned the right to wear two tiny brass ``V'' pins, which signify
valor, for having earned the medals in combat.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary's action stopped short of revising Boorda's
service record, meaning that, officially, the questions about the
decorations have not been resolved. That would have required a
formal review by the Board for Correction of Naval Records, which
considers appeals on the awarding of decorations.
</P>
<P>
   Boorda had decided against such an appeal. Dalton also opted
against an appeal, Navy officials said on Wednesday night, because
it could have revived the controversy over Boorda's service.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in a memorandum dated April 3, Dalton made it clear that
there was evidence supporting Boorda's right to wear the
decorations. Dalton wrote that citations awarding Boorda's medals
for his service ``plainly state that they were awarded for service
including `combat operations' and `while operating in combat
missions,''' suggesting the combat decorations were warranted,
though they were not specified.
</P>
<P>
   Dalton's memorandum also noted the views of Zumwalt, who
commanded naval forces in the Vietnam War and served as chief of
naval operations from 1970 to 1974. At the time of the suicide,
Zumwalt said he believed Boorda deserved the combat decorations,
but he put his views in another memorandum, dated May 18, that
Dalton also included in the official record.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy has notified the admiral's widow, Bettie Boorda, of the
notations. One official said she had sought some official
recognition from the Navy that her husband had merited the awards.
</P>
<P>
   Boorda was the first sailor in the Navy to rise from the lowest
enlisted rank to become a four-star admiral and later the supreme
commander. He was 56 when he died.
</P>
<P>
   He received the Navy's Achievement Medal as a weapons officer
aboard the John R. Craig in 1965 and the Navy Commendation Medal
for service as executive officer about the Brooke from 1971 to
1973. Neither of those citations specifically awarded the ``V'' pin
designating combat service.
</P>
<P>
   Boorda stopped wearing the ``V'' pins when questions first arose
about them.
</P>
<P>
   In his memorandum, Zumwalt said Boorda's citations noted combat
service. He also said that as chief of naval operations during the
war he personally told officers and sailors that they were
authorized to wear the combat decoration on any medal received
``for duty in the combat theater of Vietnam.''

   Lesson for Lewis: &QL; 
That's life, kid
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THE evening began with Rashard Lewis looking so bright, so dapper
in his tan suit, crisp white shirt and colorful tie that made a
perfect ensemble to go with his beaming, hopeful smile.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a back room at General Motors Place in Vancouver,
British Columbia, this was the face of the future. Until it was
slapped by the cold reality of today.
</P>
<P>
   It was painful to watch, an experience you wouldn't wish on any
18-year-old anywhere, let alone a nice, local kid whose only desire
was to be picked by the hometown team.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner David Stern kept coming out from behind the wall to
announce the next selection in the 1998 NBA draft, and each time
you could practically feel Lewis holding his breath, almost hear
his heart beating as he waited, waited for his name to be called.
</P>
<P>
   Picks No. 8, 9 and 10 passed. Then 11, 12 and 13.
</P>
<P>
   The stage was set. The planets were aligned. It was the Rockets'
turn to make a choice, and the hometown kid was right there on the
board at No. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Thrice disappointed
</P>
<P>
   And he stayed there as the Rockets took 6-5 Michael Dickerson of
Arizona. They went for athleticism. They went for a player who lit
up their private workouts with his 3-point-shooting ability. They
went for a guy who can fill the lanes and finish a fast break, who
has played solid defense and won an NCAA championship.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando took Matt Harpring at No. 15, and the TV cameras swung
back into the ``green room'' for another glimpse at Lewis as the
Rockets prepared to make their second pick of the first round.
</P>
<P>
   No. 16 for the Rockets was Bryce Drew, the heady 6-3 guard who
will be immortalized on the highlight reels of March Madness for
decades to come as they replay that incredible, dramatic
last-second shot that lifted his team, tiny Valparaiso, over Ole
Miss. They went for a coach's son, a smart, feisty player. He can
create his own shot. He runs well off picks. He handles the ball
and shows leadership characteristics that could make him a point
guard for a veteran team that has been looking for somebody to step
forward and grab the job by the throat.
</P>
<P>
   In the back room, Lewis' face sagged, and there was a flicker of
doubt in those lively brown eyes.
</P>
<P>
   You tell an 18-year-old that the world isn't his oyster, waiting
to be slurped. Then, tell a high school star who spent his prep
career dunking over players smaller than him, draining 3-pointers,
that life doesn't always work out as planned.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is 6-10 on the court and starred proudly for Elsik. But as
the night wore on, you could almost see him shrinking inside that
nice suit, trying to make himself smaller so those TV cameras
couldn't see him. Boom! It was a dream exploding on TNT.
</P>
<P>
   There was still one more chance at No. 18. Then, Mirsad Turkcan
of Turkey became a Rocket. And Lewis was left stuck on the
launching pad, filled with a sense of what? Shock? Disbelief?
Betrayal?
</P>
<P>
   It's the risk they take when they go straight from high school
to the pros, a big gamble. Who remembers Taj McDavid? He was a high
school phenom from South Carolina in 1996 who was never drafted or
signed by the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Are they really ready? Who will be patient enough to care,
nurture and develop them? Who can afford to wait?
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the kid that we really liked his game,'' admitted
Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich. ``He was fourth on our list. I did
think we would end up with him if one of our other guys was already
gone when it was our turn. Things just worked out perfect for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockets want help immediately
</P>
<P>
   But not for Lewis, who eventually went to Seattle with the 32nd
overall pick, the third choice of the second round. That means a
non-guaranteed contract. No instant millions. He appeared on TNT,
eyes already red, and nearly broke down in tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart is bigger than Texas, and I will show it,'' he said.
Later on, he ripped into the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   That's all right. He is young and had just been taught a harsh
lesson, one more painful than a blind-side pick by Shaquille
O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA, in the era of free agency, is a live-for-today
business. There is no time for sentimentality or provincialism. The
Rockets are trying to win a championship now, next season, before
Hakeem Olajuwon and Charles Barkley need canes. They do not have
time to wait on an 18-year-old to mature. The Sonics need backups.
The Rockets need starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This probably disappointed him a lot,'' Tomjanovich said.
``But this might be the thing to get him to go out and prove people
wrong. The guy's got a tremendous upside. But we've got to look out
for our basic needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it post-high school lesson No. 1: It's a cold world,
Rashard.

NELSON REINFORCES HIS REPUTATION, IF NOT MAVERICKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ By the time this gets to Phoenix, they'll be laughing.
</P>
<P>
   But they've been laughing at the Mavericks in Phoenix for nearly
two years, so how is this any different?
</P>
<P>
   On a night that brimmed with promise, Don Nelson instead sorted
through the Mavericks' blueprints, surveyed the NBA draft pool,
finessed the telephone lines and, in the end, slipped another
whoopee cushion under loyal Mavs fans.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1 draft pick for this year, by most reports, isn't
coming for at least two years. The No. 1 pick for next year isn't
coming _ ever.
</P>
<P>
   Teams with major rebuilding jobs are not supposed to trade their
No. 1 draft pick _ absolved from lottery protection _ for backup
point guards.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix _ again _ they have to be chortling. This was not
like the Jason Kidd thing. This was not like the
Here-Take-These-Big-Contracts thing.
</P>
<P>
   Nellie inherited those earlier mistakes. But this one _ the
unprotected 1999 draft pick for Steve Nash _ he thought up all on
his own.
</P>
<P>
   And when it was over, with vintage Nelson mad-scientist aplomb,
he proclaimed it a great day for the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to turn the franchise around,'' he told a roomful of
media infidels last night, ``and we made a major step in that
direction today.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to the night apparently was Nash. Ensconced behind Kidd
and Kevin Johnson in Phoenix, the 6-foot-3 guard was depicted by
Nellie as an immediate franchise cornerstone.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of us might depict him, however, as more like a Mike
Iuzzulino Starter Kit.
</P>
<P>
   But Nelson made it sound as if the price _ extravagant though it
was _ was right.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of teams were offering a great deal for him,'' Nelson
explained. ``We feel very lucky to get him for what we did. He's a
very fine player.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Nelson's son, Donnie, knows Nash well from their days
together in Phoenix. But let's roll the calendar ahead to next
year's draft.
</P>
<P>
   The habitual 20-win Mavericks could very well be in the lottery
hunt again. And the playoff-likely Suns would get the first pick.
</P>
<P>
   Nellie, of course, had an answer for that _ ``We evaluated the
draft for next year, and we don't think it's a good draft.''
</P>
<P>
   Good grief. There isn't going to be one player in the country
who could help this awful team?
</P>
<P>
   ``The talent level is depleted,'' Nellie said, pointing to the
growing number of early defections.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he said, next year is ``our free-agent year.'' This
year was for draft choices.
</P>
<P>
   Oh. And for a few minutes there, we thought it was the Year of
the Cow.
</P>
<P>
   For more than an hour, the ample posterior of Michigan's Robert
Traylor was parked next to the Mavericks' name on the NBA draft
board. The ruse puzzled folks. Traylor _ no pun intended _ would
not have been a good fit.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson's fondness, as well as his son Donnie's, for German-born
Dirk Nowitzki was predictable. Assistant coach Donnie knows the
international talent pool as well as anyone in an NBA front office.
</P>
<P>
   But the 20-year-old's own coach in Germany has said that there's
no way that Nowitzki will play in America until after the 2000
Olympics. And though Nellie stubbornly thinks he can change that,
what if he doesn't?
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks passed on the opportunity to draft Kansas forward
Paul Pierce and guard Larry Hughes of Saint Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Both likely could have made an immediate impact. If nothing
else, either could have been a living, breathing, uniform-wearing
reminder that the franchise does have a future.
</P>
<P>
   Future? That remains a vague and fuzzy concept around Reunion
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   When he Roto-Rootered the franchise with the trade with New
Jersey two seasons ago, Nelson said he was pleased because the
franchise cornerstone was now in place. He was referring to his new
point guard and center, respectively, Robert Pack and Shawn
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   (Insert winces here).
</P>
<P>
   The latest cornerstone, alas, is now Nash. And talented, young
Michael Finley. And a kid from Germany to arrive later?
</P>
<P>
   That's going to sell tickets?
</P>
<P>
   Nellie, of course, gets paid whether you go to the games or not.
He and son Donnie, literally, have the deal of the century.
</P>
<P>
   When he was asked about whether Mavericks fans should be
excited, Nelson answered, curiously, ``You know, it doesn't matter.
They can be skeptical. But it'll all prove out.''
</P>
<P>
   Patiences are wearing satin-thin. But Nelson, who himself has
been here less than 18 months, seems to think Mavericks fans will
be patient.
</P>
<P>
   He wheels. He deals. He winks.
</P>
<P>
   And at the same time, behind the curtains, he pulls the levers
and delights in the sleight of hand. The franchise's Wizard of
Arrrghs.
</P>
<P>
   No. Sooner or later, that won't sell tickets.

TRADES BRING NOWITZKI, NASH TO MAVS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Tuesday, Mavericks general manager Don Nelson called
trading the sixth pick in the NBA draft for Nos. 9 and 19 ``the
dumbest thing I've ever heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Last night, he might have set a new standard.
</P>
<P>
   With potential All-Star Paul Pierce having inexplicably fallen
in his lap at No. 6, Nelson instead pulled the trigger on a
three-team trade that left the Mavericks with Phoenix Suns
third-team point guard Steve Nash, the rights to German
``wunderkind'' Dirk Nowitzki and without a No. 1 pick in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas picked up Mississippi small forward Ansu Sesay with the
first pick in the second round, 30th overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we were tempted to do we got done; it worked like
clockwork,'' said Nelson, who negotiated the complicated deal with
the Milwaukee Bucks and the Suns. ``Nash is the point guard we've
wanted for a long time, and we're hopeful of changing Dirk's mind
and getting him to sign with us right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks first swapped first-round picks with the Bucks,
acquiring Milwaukee's ninth and 19th selections and taking Michigan
forward Robert Traylor for them at No. 6. With the ninth selection,
they took Nowitzki. Then at 19, they drafted Notre Dame's Pat
Garrity and sent him to the Suns along with Bubba Wells, Martin
Muursepp and next season's unconditional No. 1 draft choice in
exchange for Nash.
</P>
<P>
   Despite admitting the success of the night's dealings depended
heavily upon signing Nowitzki now and making the playoffs next
season, Nelson had little sympathy for fans who had sought
immediate help for their perennial loser.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if the fans are excited; they can be
skeptical if they want to,'' Nelson said. ``To me, we took a major
step.''
</P>
<P>
   While freeing salary-cap space after getting rid of Wells and
Muursepp appears to be a plus, surrendering what could turn out to
be a '99 lottery pick is a scary proposition for a team that won 20
games last season and has missed the playoffs a league-high eight
consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to part with No. 1s like that,'' Nelson admitted.
``But we evaluated next year's draft, and I don't like it much.
Plus, we plan on that pick not being very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Relinquishing an unprotected pick backfired on the Mavs in '96,
when they gave their No. 1 to the Celtics in exchange for Eric
Montross. Nelson traded the ineffective Montross at midseason, the
Mavericks finished in the lottery and Boston wound up selecting Ron
Mercer with the sixth pick in last year's draft.
</P>
<P>
   While Nash is expected to be the team's starting point guard,
the key to the deal and the draft is Nowitzki, a 6-foot-11 small
forward who has told NBA teams he won't play in America until
competing for his country in the 2000 Olympics. Nelson and
assistant coach Donnie Nelson left for Germany this morning, where
they are scheduled to hook up with owner Ross Perot Jr. to try to
persuade Nowitzki to come to the NBA now.
</P>
<P>
   Nowitzki's agent, Holger Geschwinder, said Tuesday NBA teams
would be ``wasting'' their picks on Nowitzki, who scored 33 points
and grabbed 14 rebounds in his only U.S. appearance, in a high
school all-star game in San Antonio coached by Donnie Nelson. With
their financial allotment from the ninth pick, the Mavericks can
offer Nowitzki a contract of about $1.3 million. Geschwinder said
his player has offers on the table of $2 million tax-free from
teams in Italy and Greece.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shouldn't be optimistic, but this is a special situation,''
said Nelson, who called Nowitzki and Geschwinder immediately after
the selection. ``They told us he wouldn't sign \Rin Europe\S, that
they would at least show us that respect. I'm just hoping, really.
But he's a major player with incredible skills. If we don't get him
now, he's worth the wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of keeping next year's No. 1 pick and drafting Pierce to
fill a desperate need at small forward, the Mavericks are left with
a point guard who couldn't find playoff playing time behind Jason
Kidd or Kevin Johnson in Phoenix and the possibility of waiting at
least two years for Nowitzki. In order to persuade Nowitzki to
leave Europe, the Mavericks must also clear the hurdle of the
looming lockout scheduled to cease league operations July 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pierce was my second-favorite player in the draft,'' Nelson
said. ``I just think Nowitzki is going to be better.''
</P>
<P>
   Nash, 24, was the 15th overall pick by Phoenix in the '96 draft.
The 6-foot-3, 195-pounder averaged 9.1 points and 3.4 assists per
game in 21.9 minutes last season. He finished 13th in the NBA in
3-point shooting at 41 percent. Despite the fact Nash rarely played
in Phoenix' first-round playoff loss to San Antonio, Nelson said
the two players and first-round pick was a bargain price.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a hot commodity,'' he said of Nash, entering the last
year of a three-year deal paying him approximately $1 million.
``We're lucky to get him for what we did. He's one of the top point
guards in the league, probably in the 10-15 range. He needs his own
team, and he'll be here for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowitzki, who turned 20 last week, is considered the best German
prospect since Detlef Schrempf, drafted in the first round by
Dallas in 1985 before becoming an All-Star in Seattle. Nowitzki,
offered scholarships from Cal and Kentucky, averaged 17.5 points in
20 games for DJK Wurzburg of the German League last season.

MCLEMORE DOES IT ALL FOR RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The Rangers regained the services of second baseman
Mark McLemore on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He provided a catalyst for their offense.
</P>
<P>
   McLemore, who entered the game last night with the third-best
on-base percentage (.426) in the American League, scored all of the
Rangers' runs in a 3-2 victory against the Arizona Diamondbacks
last night at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   McLemore's one-out, eighth-inning single off Diamondbacks
right-hander Willie Blair gave right fielder Juan Gonzalez an
opportunity to drive in the potential game-winning run.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez met the challenge, sending a 1-1 pitch from Blair
(2-11) deep into center field, where it glanced off an overhang for
what proved to be the game-winning, run-scoring triple.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Rick Helling (11-3) joined teammate Aaron Sele
(11-4) as the only other 11-game winner in the major leagues by
surrendering two runs (one earned) on five hits and three walks in
7 1/3 innings. John Wetteland pitched a scoreless ninth for his
21st save.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's leading the world in RBI,'' McLemore said of Gonzalez,
``so somebody's got to be on base for him. It just happened that it
was me tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   McLemore was a catalyst for the Rangers' offense the first 10
weeks of the season before being sidelined for two weeks by a
muscle pull in his left hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Yet McLemore, who was reinstated Monday from the 15-day disabled
list, showed for the second consecutive evening that he remains a
force with which to be reckoned. His return became more important
with leadoff hitter Tom Goodwin mired in a 7-for-49 slump.
</P>
<P>
   McLemore played a significant role in the Rangers' first two
runs, giving Helling an early, two-run advantage with which to
work. McLemore's one-out, first-inning single resulted in the first
run.
</P>
<P>
   Left fielder Rusty Greer drew the walk that advanced McLemore
into scoring position, and Gonzalez delivered a run-scoring single
off Blair for the 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   McLemore did the job by himself in the third inning. His fourth
home run this season _ a one-out, solo shot off Blair on a 3-2
pitch _ gave the Rangers a 2-0 lead in the third inning. McLemore
claimed that the 0-2 pitch in that at-bat glanced off his helmet.
But there was no call. ``I said, `Forget it and let's go.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks, though, matched the Rangers with a two-run
fifth inning. Helling surrendered a one-out single to Blair, who
snapped an 0-for-24 streak at the plate. Blair advanced to third on
the ensuing double by second baseman Andy Fox, setting the stage
for the bizarre play that created the tie.
</P>
<P>
   Helling, who entered the fifth having surrendered only three
singles and walk, recorded a much-needed strikeout of center
fielder Devon White with runners at second and third base.
</P>
<P>
   However, catcher Ivan Rodriguez failed to smother the curveball
that Helling bounced in the dirt. Blair scored on the wild pitch,
but Rodriguez's errant throw got away from Helling. Rodriguez's
second error this season allowed Fox to score from second, and
White _ with first base unoccupied _ raced to second base on the
play.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, though, helped prevent the Diamondbacks from taking a
lead by retiring White on an attempted one-out steal of third base.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rick Reed won another game Wednesday night, which
isn't big news considering how well he has pitched the last two
seasons. This time, he beat Baltimore, 6-3, at Shea Stadium,
allowing only one run over seven innings as he improved his season
record to 9-4 and lowered his earned run average to 2.31.
</P>
<P>
   In a game that marked the first time the Orioles have played at
Shea Stadium since the 1969 World Series, Reed was the star of the
show, with Brian McRae and Mike Piazza helping out with home runs
and John Franco picking up another save in the ninth inning. For
Reed, it was just more evidence that he has developed into one of
the best pitchers in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it appears he may not even be an All-Star for the first
time, which would be just another setback for Reed, who bounced
around five organizations over a decade and even became a
replacement player during the baseball strike of 1994-95 before
finding a new life with the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Reed is timing. He is scheduled to pitch on
Sunday, July 5, the last day before the All-Star Game break. And
according to Mets Manager Bobby Valentine, ``it has already been
announced that anybody who pitches on the last day of the first
half doesn't make the All-Star team.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Florida Manager Jim Leyland, who will choose the
National League's pitching staff, has not officially announced that
that will be his strategy.
</P>
<P>
   But that is the way Leyland is believed to be leaning, perhaps
because he will only choose 10 pitchers and any starter who pitches
two days before the All-Star Game is usually not available to pitch
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   And when asked if he would shuffle his rotation so that Reed
will not have to pitch on July 5, Valentine, whose team is fighting
for a post-season berth, said: ``Nope. The weather might. But I
won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Should Reed indeed be overlooked by Leyland, who managed him
earlier in his career, his response is certain to be of the ``Aw,
shucks'' variety. Earlier this season, Reed said he needs the three
days off to go house hunting just outside of his native Huntington,
W.Va., anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But Reed _ who will probably use the three days off to do a
little hunting and fishing, too _ has also admitted he could easily
look for another house some other time
</P>
<P>
   Entering last night, Reed was tied for third in the league in
e.r.a. He allowed a first-inning run after hitting Eric Davis in
the elbow with a pitch (Davis left the game three innings later)
and then allowing a Rafael Palmeiro double and a Roberto Alomar
run-scoring groundout.
</P>
<P>
   McRae tied the score with a one-out homer off former Met
right-hander Pete Smith (0-2) in the second. McRae then preserved
the tie by throwing Chris Hoiles out at the plate as he tried to
score from second on a two-out Mike Bordick single.
</P>
<P>
   Reed pumped his fist behind home plate as Piazza tagged Bordick
out. Then the former journeyman pitcher, who allowed nine hits in
all, sparked his own game-winning rally with a one-out single off
Smith in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   From there, it was a comedy of errors _ and wild pitches. The
Mets ended up scoring four runs in the inning, all earned, to make
it a 5-1 game, on: four singles, three wild pitches (one by Smith,
two by Norm Charlton on two-strike counts), one Smith throwing
error and a walk.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza added a little emphasis by crushing his 13th home run of
the season to the back of the bleachers in left.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Pulsipher came on in the eighth to a nice ovation in his
first stint at Shea since 1995. But after pitching well in
Baltimore two nights earlier, Pulsipher allowed three hits,
including a two-run B.J. Surhoff home run, before Mel Rojas, of all
people, came on to bail Pulsipher out of the jam.

   LONDON _ President Bill Clinton has been invited to Tiananmen
Square by China's leaders during his Beijing visit this week. He
must accept. I can tell him exactly where to stand.
</P>
<P>
   It is a cluster of paving stones not far from the ``Golden
Water'' bridges leading to the Forbidden City and a huge portrait
of Mao, which hangs over the gate into the imperial palaces.
</P>
<P>
   On those stones, in the middle of the night of June 3-4, 1989, I
watched an armored personnel carrier pursue an unarmed
demonstrator, run him down and squash him, leaving his blood
glistening under the street lamps.
</P>
<P>
   Next to me about three minutes later a Chinese man wearing a
T-shirt suddenly slumped over the bridge railing, shot dead by the
soldiers of the 38th Army advancing across the square along the
Forbidden City's vermilion walls.
</P>
<P>
   A few hundred yards away, the next morning, I watched the army
mow down dozens of people trying to enter the square to find their
dead relatives.
</P>
<P>
   When he stands on those paving stones, with the press around
him, Clinton should speak of the longing for liberty of Asia's
peoples. When it is frustrated, he should say, these longings lead
to scenes like the recent ones in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   Those scenes were carefully edited for Chinese television so
that the Indonesian students barely appeared. This permitted the
official Chinese commentator to bewail what was happening in the
capital of the world's fourth most populous country as ``chaos''
and ``instability,'' two of the four key words still used today in
Beijing to describe the events of early June nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Another phrase still used today, although it has been recently
removed from the criminal code, is ``counterrevolutionary
uprising,'' the charge employed to arrest and imprison tens of
thousands of Chinese all over the country after the June 4
killings.
</P>
<P>
   The official word used to describe what happened in Tiananmen
Square and its aftermath is ``incident.'' The Chinese leadership
insists on this euphemism because it minimizes what remains the
greatest unresolved political problem in China.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's host, President Jiang Zemin, has referred to the
West's interest in Tiananmen as ``much ado about nothing.'' This is
also the view of Hong Kong's Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa, whose
verdict on June 4, 1989, is that ``It happened _ leave it to
history.''
</P>
<P>
   Doubtless there are advisers in Clinton's entourage who assure
him that young people in China are ``interested only in making
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Deng Xiaoping certainly did not think that the 1989 killings
were a mere incident or much ado about nothing.
</P>
<P>
   He told Lee Tsung-dao of Columbia University, a Nobel laureate
in physics, and former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau that
Tiananmen was far more dangerous than the Cultural Revolution, and
that the ``so-called democratic fighters'' could have broken China
apart. Fortunately for China, Deng said ``I was still around.''
</P>
<P>
   He was indeed, and in the ensuing qingcha, or ferreting out, 4
million Communist Party members, out of a total of more than 40
million, plus high and low government officials, intellectuals,
bureaucrats, scientists and journalists were investigated.
Thousands were arrested, tortured and executed. No one knows how
many are still detained.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International records more than 250 post-Tiananmen
prisoners, but in its latest report observes that ``the real number
is much higher.''
</P>
<P>
   I saw three of Amnesty's ``names'' commit the crime for which
they remain behind bars. They hurled little pots of paint at the
Mao portrait in Tiananmen, and the thin blue, green and yellow
streams ran down the gigantic cheeks and over the huge wart.
</P>
<P>
   For this they received, respectively, 16 years, 20 years and
life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   All were tortured, according to reports from Hunan, where they
are detained, and one went mad. The portrait was replaced within an
hour by an identical hand-painted spare, perhaps the one Clinton
will see.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton likes to say to those who suffer, ``I feel your pain.''
He should ask for an interview with Professor Ding Zilin. She is
the mother of a college student shot dead in Tiananmen.
</P>
<P>
   Despite constant police harassment, she has collected two dozen
other mothers whose children were killed and who periodically
petition the government (they have just done so again ) to
investigate what happened on the night of June 3-4, who gave the
orders to shoot, and on what grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose that in Beijing alone some thousands were killed or
wounded. How many friends and relatives did those Beijing people,
from every walk of life, have? And how many more across China were
related to the vast throng of those caught in the ``ferreting
out''?
</P>
<P>
   What people want to know, says the historian Dai Qing, who has
been imprisoned herself but continues to delve into the dark past
of the Chinese Communist regime, is: ``How did we end up in this
mess? Where did we go wrong?''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton should use his Tiananmen exposure to answer
some of these disturbing questions. Despite China's experienced
censors, he will have the biggest audience of his life. &QL;

<P>
   LONDON _ President Bill Clinton has been invited to Tiananmen
Square by China's leaders during his Beijing visit this week. He
must accept. I can tell him exactly where to stand.
</P>
<P>
   It is a cluster of paving stones not far from the ``Golden
Water'' bridges leading to the Forbidden City and a huge portrait
of Mao, which hangs over the gate into the imperial palaces.
</P>
<P>
   On those stones, in the middle of the night of June 3-4, 1989, I
watched an armored personnel carrier pursue an unarmed
demonstrator, run him down and squash him, leaving his blood
glistening under the street lamps.
</P>
<P>
   Next to me about three minutes later a Chinese man wearing a
T-shirt suddenly slumped over the bridge railing, shot dead by the
soldiers of the 38th Army advancing across the square along the
Forbidden City's vermilion walls.
</P>
<P>
   A few hundred yards away, the next morning, I watched the army
mow down dozens of people trying to enter the square to find their
dead relatives.
</P>
<P>
   When he stands on those paving stones, with the press around
him, Clinton should speak of the longing for liberty of Asia's
peoples. When it is frustrated, he should say, these longings lead
to scenes like the recent ones in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   Those scenes were carefully edited for Chinese television so
that the Indonesian students barely appeared. This permitted the
official Chinese commentator to bewail what was happening in the
capital of the world's fourth most populous country as ``chaos''
and ``instability,'' two of the four key words still used today in
Beijing to describe the events of early June nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Another phrase still used today, although it has been recently
removed from the criminal code, is ``counterrevolutionary
uprising,'' the charge employed to arrest and imprison tens of
thousands of Chinese all over the country after the June 4
killings.
</P>
<P>
   The official word used to describe what happened in Tiananmen
Square and its aftermath is ``incident.'' The Chinese leadership
insists on this euphemism because it minimizes what remains the
greatest unresolved political problem in China.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's host, President Jiang Zemin, has referred to the
West's interest in Tiananmen as ``much ado about nothing.'' This is
also the view of Hong Kong's Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa, whose
verdict on June 4, 1989, is that ``It happened _ leave it to
history.''
</P>
<P>
   Doubtless there are advisers in Clinton's entourage who assure
him that young people in China are ``interested only in making
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Deng Xiaoping certainly did not think that the 1989 killings
were a mere incident or much ado about nothing.
</P>
<P>
   He told Lee Tsung-dao of Columbia University, a Nobel laureate
in physics, and former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau that
Tiananmen was far more dangerous than the Cultural Revolution, and
that the ``so-called democratic fighters'' could have broken China
apart. Fortunately for China, Deng said ``I was still around.''
</P>
<P>
   He was indeed, and in the ensuing qingcha, or ferreting out, 4
million Communist Party members, out of a total of more than 40
million, plus high and low government officials, intellectuals,
bureaucrats, scientists and journalists were investigated.
Thousands were arrested, tortured and executed. No one knows how
many are still detained.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International records more than 250 post-Tiananmen
prisoners, but in its latest report observes that ``the real number
is much higher.''
</P>
<P>
   I saw three of Amnesty's ``names'' commit the crime for which
they remain behind bars. They hurled little pots of paint at the
Mao portrait in Tiananmen, and the thin blue, green and yellow
streams ran down the gigantic cheeks and over the huge wart.
</P>
<P>
   For this they received, respectively, 16 years, 20 years and
life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   All were tortured, according to reports from Hunan, where they
are detained, and one went mad. The portrait was replaced within an
hour by an identical hand-painted spare, perhaps the one Clinton
will see.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton likes to say to those who suffer, ``I feel your pain.''
He should ask for an interview with Professor Ding Zilin. She is
the mother of a college student shot dead in Tiananmen.
</P>
<P>
   Despite constant police harassment, she has collected two dozen
other mothers whose children were killed and who periodically
petition the government (they have just done so again ) to
investigate what happened on the night of June 3-4, who gave the
orders to shoot, and on what grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose that in Beijing alone some thousands were killed or
wounded. How many friends and relatives did those Beijing people,
from every walk of life, have? And how many more across China were
related to the vast throng of those caught in the ``ferreting
out''?
</P>
<P>
   What people want to know, says the historian Dai Qing, who has
been imprisoned herself but continues to delve into the dark past
of the Chinese Communist regime, is: ``How did we end up in this
mess? Where did we go wrong?''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton should use his Tiananmen exposure to answer
some of these disturbing questions. Despite China's experienced
censors, he will have the biggest audience of his life. &QL;

<P>
   BANGKOK _ Available now from a telephone near you: cut-rate
international calls via the Internet, no computer required.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently only computer hobbyists could cajole their
computers into acting like telephones. Now, thanks to rapid
advances in technology, Internet telephone calls can be made by
anyone with a standard touch-tone phone.
</P>
<P>
   The explosive growth of the phenomenon is attracting major
telecommunications companies, thousands of subscribers and a
handful of pirates who sail along the fringes of the law.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Internet developments, these telephone services made
their debut in the United States, where they offer transcontinental
calls for a few cents per minute, a fraction of the standard rate.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, however, Internet phone companies have sprung
up on almost every continent, making rapid inroads into established
markets despite their lower quality.
</P>
<P>
   Internet-based calls frequently have annoying echoes, long
delays and reduced voice clarity compared to regular connections.
But for many consumers, the tremendous cost savings _ often more
than 50 percent _ outweigh the inconvenience. And the technology is
rapidly improving.
</P>
<P>
   Internet phone calls cross international borders in a form
identical to normal Internet data.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, Internet phone service works the same way as
standard international calling cards: Subscribers use any
touch-tone telephone to dial a local access number, followed by an
identity code and the number they wish to reach.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, at the local access number, the call is
bounced off the traditional phone network and into the Internet by
a so-called gateway computer. In the destination city, the call is
brought back out of the Internet and onto the standard phone
network by the operator's corresponding gateway.
</P>
<P>
   For voice to travel via Internet, the gateway computers
translate standard analog telephone signals into digital bits, much
like music on a compact disk.
</P>
<P>
   So by traveling most of the distance as data in the Internet,
international calls can effectively be made for the price of two
local phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   But cheap calls are just one advantage of using the Internet for
telephone calls, according to industry advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology used in standard telephone systems was
developed 40 years ago and is based on old concepts,'' said Jeff
Pulver, president of Pulver.com, an Internet telephone consultancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet's efficient digital platform opens the way for many
value-added services, like cheap conference calls,
videoconferencing and people sharing documents while talking,''
Pulver said.
</P>
<P>
   The digital method of transmission will eventually allow an
Internet phone to leapfrog the traditional telephone in quality,
according to those in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet phone calls use the most advanced all-digital
equipment, so it is like listening to music on a compact disc,''
said Darryl Green, president and chief executive officer of the
AT&AMP;T Jens Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, ``we have already improved our technology
enough so that with blind tests, people can no longer tell the
difference between an Internet call and a regular call.''
</P>
<P>
   To create an Internet telephone company, operators simply set up
gateway computers in separate cities to bring calls on and off the
Internet. An off-the-shelf personal computer can readily serve as a
gateway, but quality improves dramatically with specialized
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the low overhead, countries with high-cost overseas
calls and recently deregulated telecommunications industries have
experienced dramatic shifts of consumers who are moving into
Internet-based phone services.
</P>
<P>
   In 10 months, an Internet telephone service in Japan offered by
the AT&AMP;T joint venture Jens claims to have grabbed 1 percent of the
country's $4.5 billion outgoing international call market on an
investment of less than $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Deregulated markets will help Internet phone operators swallow
36 percent of the international call market within five years,
threatening the core revenue and profits of traditional telephone
operators, according to a report released this month by the
Cambridge-based consultancy Analysys.
</P>
<P>
   The unregulated days of Internet telephones may, however, be
numbered. The United States government is now considering a levy on
Internet phone operators similar to that paid by traditional
long-distance carriers.
</P>
<P>
   But even in heavily regulated countries, where international
calls are controlled by state-sanctioned monopolies, Internet
telephone calling is making its debut.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Singapore Telecom, which holds the monopoly on
outgoing international calls until the year 2000, began testing its
BudgetCall service which routes calls via the Internet to 18
countries and undercuts the company's regular international call
rate by 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that it is technically illegal to sell
international calls from many countries, independent operators are
already using technology to circumvent the law.
</P>
<P>
   Two companies recently founded in Singapore _ RVNet and Global
Voice _ are building clandestine networks linking the tightly
regulated telecommunications networks of Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The legal status of Internet phone is very gray in most Asian
countries, so for the time being, the company avoids advertising
very much in local papers, said James Cai, who is the managing
director of Global Voice.
</P>
<P>
   Cai claims that 2,000 subscribers have signed on in the two
months since the service was launched in Singapore. ``But for us,
outside of Singapore, we don't worry about local laws. We leave
that to franchise holders who join our network.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Ngor, general manager of RVNet, said: ``It may not be
fully legal, but the telecom companies are unable to stop the calls
going through the Internet, and we will eat into their
international dialing revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Cai plans to build the Global Voice network by selling his
gateways as franchises to target various ethnic groups around Asia,
especially Japanese living overseas.
</P>
<P>
   For about $10,000, franchise holders buy a personal computer
configured to work as a Global Voice network gateway. Once plugged
in, calls can be made through the Internet to any city with a
fellow franchise holder.
</P>
<P>
   Global Voice ensures that calls go to the right gateways,
monitors the pattern of calls and settles billing differences
between franchise holders if calls are made more in one direction
than another.
</P>
<P>
   To start with, Global Voice recommends that franchise holders
undercut the standard international rates by 50 percent. ``When
more Internet phone services are offered, we will have to lower the
price again,'' Cai said.
</P>
<P>
   Internet telephone technology is advancing so quickly that even
today's model of phone service provider could change dramatically
within the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   While Global Voice and RVNet are building their networks around
self-developed technology, U.S. modem giant 3Com Corp. will soon
begin selling an upgrade to their popular servers that allows any
Internet provider to become a phone company.
</P>
<P>
   ``For just a few hundred dollars' upgrade, any Internet service
provider that uses our servers will be able to send telephone calls
over the Internet,'' said Ken Jensen, account development manager
at 3Com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we have a 40 percent market share among Internet service
providers and our equipment is being used in almost every country,
all an Internet provider needs to do is agree how they will sell
the phone calls between one another, and they can be an
international phone company,'' he said. &QL;

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Knicks on Wednesday night severed their
decadelong relationship with Charles Oakley, considered the heart
and soul of the team, in a trade that will send him to the Toronto
Raptors for the injury-plagued, 6-foot-11-inch forward Marcus
Camby, according to three officials with the teams.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Knicks were expected to give their second pick
in the draft, the 44th over all, Sean Marks, a center from
California, and cash to the financially strapped Raptors.
</P>
<P>
   The trade was not officially announced by the Knicks because
they had not been unable to contact Oakley.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks are still looking for a point guard and have
expressed great interest in Milwaukee's Terrell Brandon. They could
offer John Starks, Chris Mills and Chris Childs.
</P>
<P>
   Early on Thursday morning, 90 minutes after the draft had ended,
Ernie Grunfeld, president of the Knicks, came out of his office and
said: ``We will have an announcement tomorrow. We cannot announce
anything until the parties involved have been contacted. This is
only fair to them.''
</P>
<P>
   One Knick teammate who requested anonymity said on Wednesday
night that he ``was shocked that the organization would trade
Oakley.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he considered the public's outcry to the
announcement, Grunfeld said, ``We have to do what we have to do for
our team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks have to be concerned about public sentiment toward
the 35-year-old Oakley, who was noted for his aggressive rebounding
and head-first dives for loose balls since he arrived in New York
in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley has always been the first to say that the NBA is a
business-first proposition, but those close to him say that he will
be upset about his trade to a noncontender.
</P>
<P>
   With Camby, the Knicks are likely to move Larry Johnson back to
power forward, altering the makeup of the frontcourt that was so
familiar to Knick fans. With Oakley's absence on the boards, it
could mean more work for Patrick Ewing, who is coming off a season
in which missed four months with a broken wrist.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley, who does not have a no-trade clause, may not have always
been close friends with his teammates but he was always well
respected for his all-out effort on the court. He was considered a
quiet leader and a role model to the younger players.
</P>
<P>
   The deal matched almost perfectly under the cap. Oakley made
$2.85 million this year and the 24-year-old Camby made $2.79
million.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley was offered to the Raptors so the Knicks could get a
chance at a young shot blocker and scorer like Camby.
</P>
<P>
   Although Camby's knees have been fragile in his first two pro
seasons, the Knicks are in need of a more active front-court player
than Oakley. This need was magnified when they watched Indiana's
Antonio Davis and Dale Davis block shots, grab rebounds and put
down dunks as they eliminated the Knicks in the second round of the
playoffs this year.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley was attractive to the cash-strapped Raptors because he
has one year left on his deal, even though he is scheduled to make
$10 million in the balloon year of his contract next season.
Although the Raptors believed in Camby, they feared losing him next
summer when he is eligible to become a free agent. Oakley might not
fit in with the Raptors' high-flying style, but he could be used
for a future trade.
</P>
<P>
   With their first pick, No. 38 over all, the Knicks selected
DeMarco Johnson, a 6-8 forward from North Carolina-Charlotte. &QL;

INCH OF POTENTIAL AT NO. 1 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout0 CLIPPERS GET 7 FEET 1(sw) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ His skill was hard to gauge, given
that he had played only 77 games in his life. But Michael
Olowokandi's size alone _ 7 feet 1 inch, 265 pounds _ made it
impossible for the team with the No. 1 pick, the Los Angeles
Clippers, to stubbornly choose a point guard.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers finally decided that Olowokandi's potential held
more promise than anything Arizona's guard Mike Bibby could offer.
</P>
<P>
   Completing an improbable odyssey that began in 1995 when he gave
up playing the sport recreationally in a London courtyard and came
west to Pacific, a private California university chosen blindly
from a library book, Olowokandi was plucked first by the Clippers
in the 1998 National Basketball Association draft at GM Place on
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing my name at the No. 1 spot still is unbelievable,
especially when you consider where I came from about three years
ago,'' the Nigerian-born, 23-year-old Olowokandi said. ``Having not
played basketball and having not gotten a lot of national
recognition. And then to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi's last-minute ascent to No. 1 _ Bibby was taken No. 2
by the Vancouver Grizzlies _ lent intrigue to a draft short on
impact players and long on unknown talents. Eight first-round picks
were traded in a flurry of deals on Wednesday night that spiced up
one of the more bland talent pools in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   The Grizzlies made noise, trading Antonio Daniels, the fourth
pick last season, to the San Antonio Spurs for Carl Herrera and the
rights to Felipe Lopez, the St. John's star and former schoolboy
legend from Queens who was taken 24th by the Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, born in the Dominican Republic, was one of six players
born outside of the United States to be drafted in the first round
on Wednesday night, following Olowokandi, the German Dirk Nowitzki
(chosen ninth by Milwaukee), the Slovenian Radoslav Nesterovic
(taken 17th by Minnesota) and Turkey's Mirsad Turkcan (taken 18th
by Houston). Vladimir Stepania from the Republic of Georgia was
taken 27th by Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Though neither the New York Knicks nor the New Jersey Nets had
one of the first 29 picks, the New York metropolitan area was
represented in the first round. Al Harrington, the 6-9 forward from
St. Patrick's High School in Elizabeth, N.J., was taken 25th by the
Indiana Pacers. He was the first high school player taken, ahead of
Parade Magazine's national player of the year, Rashard Lewis from
Alief Elsik High School in Alief, Texas, who was taken in the
second round, No. 32 over all, by Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Don Nelson sent players to and fro in Dallas, finally winding up
with the Phoenix point guard Steve Nash. And in a move that may
dramatically alter Eastern Conference frontlines, the Knicks worked
out a deal to move Charles Oakley, the Madison Square Garden
favorite and veteran power forward, along with Sean Marks of
California, the 44th pick, and cash, to Toronto for forward Marcus
Camby.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks traded the sixth pick, the mammoth forward Robert
(Tractor) Traylor of Michigan, to Milwaukee for the draft rights to
the Nowitzki and Notre Dame's Pat Garrity (the 19th pick). Dallas
then sent Garrity, forward Martin Muursepp, guard Bubba Wells and
its own first-round pick in 1999 to Phoenix for Nash.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver Nuggets traded Tyronn Lue of Nebraska, chosen at No.
23, and Tony Battie to the Los Angeles Lakers for Nick Van Exel.
</P>
<P>
   Among other surprises, Denver became one of several teams to
pass on the Kansas swingman Paul Pierce, who fell from one of the
top three picks all the way to the Boston Celtics at No. 10. And
Kentucky center Nazr Mohammed plummeted to the Utah Jazz at No. 29,
and was then traded to Philadelphia for future considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Pierce, the Nuggets took his teammate, the Kansas
power forward Raef LaFrentz, at No. 3. The Raptors selected North
Carolina's Antawn Jamison with the fourth pick, and the Golden
State Warriors chose his Tar Heel teammate Vince Carter with the
fifth pick. But the Raptors, knowing the Warriors wanted Jamison
all along, then traded Jamison to Golden State for Carter plus
cash.
</P>
<P>
   After Traylor, the Florida point guard Jason Williams was
selected seventh by the Sacramento Kings. With the eighth pick,
Philadelphia took the 19-year-old St. Louis shooting guard Larry
Hughes.

Floodgates open 
on Astros error
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rockies come back for 8-6 win
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
DENVER _ The Comeback Kids got a dose of their own medicine, and it
was not an easy pill to swallow.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros blew a six-run lead as their Coors Field jinx
continued Wednesday night in a demoralizing 8-6 loss to the
Colorado Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   The catalyst for the Rockies' comeback was a freakish
third-inning play on which first baseball Jeff Bagwell lost a throw
from shortstop Ricky Gutierrez in the sun. Instead of a 1-2-3
inning for Astros starter Sean Bergman, the error opened the door
for the Rockies to score five of their eight runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That play is not why we lost the game,'' Astros manager Larry
Dierker said. ``We had six more innings to keep scoring. As a
pitcher, you can't give up four or five hits just because a guy
makes an error. You have to play the whole game.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one play doesn't make a game; but things fell apart for
Bergman and the Astros during the wacky fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed,'' Bergman said. ``Any time the team
gives you a six-run lead, we should win the game. It's my fault
that we lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the blame also should go to the Astros' offense, which
shut down after the third inning. Coors Field may be a
hitter-friendly environment for most clubs, but the Astros haven't
exactly burned out any bulbs on the scoreboard. They were held to
six hits Wednesday, with five of their runs coming on a pair of
home runs by Bagwell.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' all-time record in Denver dropped to 6-22, including
a 1-3 mark this season. They have averaged 4.6 runs in the three
losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things tend to go in cycles in baseball, and we're in a bad
cycle when it comes to this place,'' Astros second baseman Craig
Biggio said. ``There's nothing you can do about it except keep
coming out here and trying to win a ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   In typical Coors Field fashion, at least one of the starting
pitchers was gone in a hurry, and a parade of relievers beat a path
from the bullpen to the mound. Wednesday, it was Bergman who got an
early hook, lasting 4 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman surrendered nine hits and seven runs, but five of them
were unearned as a result of Bagwell's error. Four of the Rockies'
nine hits against Bergman went for extra bases, including two home
runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sean didn't make too many good pitches after the third
inning,'' Dierker said. ``This game was a little bit about a
pitcher not being strong enough to get through (a bad inning) and a
little about our offense not scoring enough runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the way the game began, Rockies starter Pedro Astacio
seemed like a good candidate for an early shower. He allowed six
runs on four hits in the first three innings but settled down to an
almost unhittable level over the next five innings. Astacio retired
15 of the last 16 batters he faced and allowed one hit after the
third inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro was a different guy after we got those five runs for
him,'' Rockies manager Don Baylor said. ``He said, `I'm back in the
game. Now, I'd better do some pitching.' He really stepped it up
after that. Earlier in the game, he wasn't himself. Bagwell had
taken him out of his game.''
</P>
<P>
   The first of Bagwell's home runs was a 431-foot blast into the
left-field seats that gave the Astros a 3-0 lead in the first
inning. It also was the 200th homer of Bagwell's career. Homer No.
14 of the season was a two-run shot to straightaway center field to
put the visitors up by six runs in the third. Derek Bell had
singled home Bill Spiers one batter earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies, with some help from the setting sun, erased most of
the Astros' lead in the bottom of third. Astacio led off the inning
with a harmless grounder to short but ended up on second base after
Bagwell lost a battle with the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman retired the next two batters and would have been out of
the inning if not for Bagwell's misfortune. The Rockies took
advantage of the opportunity, scoring five runs on just three hits
in the inning. The big blow was delivered by rookie first baseman
Todd Helton, who unloaded for a three-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   Dante Bichette's solo homer tied the game in the fifth, and the
Rockies took their first lead when Vinny Castilla tripled off the
center-field wall and scored on Ellis Burks' grounder to short.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Rockies' biggest comeback since they overcame a
seven-run deficit against the Padres on July 12, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Wednesday marked the second time Bagwell had lost a
ball in the glare of the sun at Coors Field. It also happened in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember that,'' he said. ``We lost that game, too. They
were supposed to be putting some kind of screen up there to prevent
that, but I guess they didn't. That's not why we lost the game; we
obviously didn't score enough runs to win here. You also have to
give Pedro credit for shutting us down the way he did.''

 YANKEES defeat braves, 10-6  
(sw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The heat index soared above 100 degrees here on
Tomahawk Spirit Day, and Turner Field patrons fanned themselves
with their red tomahawks, rather than taunt the Yankees with them.
These were less than ideal conditions for pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   But while Atlanta's Kevin Millwood wilted, David Cone of the
Yankees found a way to get through. With sweat filling the hollow
below his Adam's apple, Cone collected the first run batted in by a
Yankees pitcher in 26 years and allowed three runs in seven
innings, beating Atlanta, 10-6, on Wednesday night. ``I like the
heat and humidity,'' the 35-year-old Cone said. ``Old guys can get
loose.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone became the third pitcher in the American League to win 10
games this season, joining Aaron Sele (11) and Rick Helling (10) of
the Texas Rangers, and bolstered his chances to win a spot as an
American League All-Star. The Yankees (52-19) and Braves (51-27)
will complete their four-game series Thursday, when David Wells
(9-2) throws against Denny Neagle (8-5).
</P>
<P>
   It was so hot in Atlanta that cabdrivers waited for their next
fare with engines running and air conditioners churning. Seen from
a distance, the city's tallest buildings appeared to ripple through
heat waves. Pitching in the heat, Yankees Manager Joe Torre said,
requires much determination and some experience. You have to ignore
the heat, understand that it can be a factor and adjust
accordingly, but determine it won't bother you.
</P>
<P>
   Cone learned about pitching in the heat long ago, throwing in
the blistering Missouri summers. ``I'd rather pitch in heat than
the cold,'' said Cone, who sometimes loses the feel of his breaking
ball when the temperature dips below 50 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   With a chance to become the fourth 10-game winner in the
National League, Millwood, a rookie right-hander, shut out the
Yankees in the first two innings; Cone allowed a run in the first,
on Ozzie Guillen's leadoff home run, and another in the second. And
yet Cone really held the advantage, in the sweltering conditions,
for Millwood had over-extended himself.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood threw 47 pitches in the first two innings, and reached
six three-ball counts the first time through the Yankees' lineup.
``He had a lot of 3-2 counts,'' said Tino Martinez, who was dropped
to the No. 5 spot and had two hits and two rbi for the Yankees.
``We knew eventually we were going to get to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Millwood threw 25 pitches to get through the third inning,
allowing his first run. His fastball, consistently 94 miles an hour
in the first inning, was down to 90 to 91 mph His meter was
running, and fast.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Curtis, the Yankees' center fielder, opened the fourth
inning with an intense seven-pitch at-bat, and walked; the last
pitch thrown to him was an 87 mph fastball. It appeared Millwood
was just about out of gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wore myself down,'' Millwood said, ``because I didn't throw
strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   As Curtis strolled to first, two infielders went to the mound,
attempting to give Millwood a chance to regain his strength. Scott
Brosius lined a hit-and-run single, Curtis stopping at third, and
with Joe Girardi batting, Millwood flopped a slider out of the
strike zone. Leo Mazzone, the Braves' pitching coach, slowly went
to the mound and, in a deliberate manner, discussed the
circumstances. Baseball rope-a-dope: the Braves were trying to get
their fighter through this one round.
</P>
<P>
   But on the fifth pitch of his at-bat, Girardi slammed a fastball
to right-center field, beyond the considerable range of Atlanta
center fielder Andruw Jones. Curtis scored to tie the games,
Brosius stopped at third and Girardi had a double. Cone dumped a
grounder to the right of Ryan Klesko, who was playing first base
only because Andres Galarraga came up with a sore back. Klesko,
left-handed, gloved the ball with his right hand, and when he saw
Brosius chugging homeward, he turned his body 180 degrees and threw
home, high, with no chance of getting Brosius.
</P>
<P>
   Javy Lopez, the Braves' catcher, then threw to first, attempting
to get Cone, and the ball bounced down the right-field line. Cone
ended up on second, bent over and testing his ankle. Giradi came
home, and the Yankees led, 4-2. Cone's rbi was the first by a
Yankee pitcher since Lindy McDaniel homered off Mickey Lolich on
Sept. 28, 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter's single scored Cone and finished Millwood, who had
thrown 93 pitches in his three and a third innings.
</P>
<P>
   Cone had found his control by then, and he whipped through the
middle innings, retiring nine straight batters on one run. He had
thrown only 99 pitches when Torre relieved him after the seventh;
he had struck out seven, allowing five hits and no walks. The
Yankees scored five more runs in the late innings, before a poor
performance by reliever Mike Stanton sullied the score a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Cone was still flushed after the game, his face damp with sweat.
But he cheerfully talked about his prospects of making the All-Star
team, a remarkable comeback considering his shoulder surgery last
fall and the fact he allowed 16 earned runs in his first two starts
this year; he has a 2.98 earned run average since then. The old guy
is on the loose. &QL;

DICKERSON'S STOCK RISES WHILE SIMON'S FALLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It is an odd twist of fate for an Arizona Wildcat, but
Michael Dickerson's accomplishments at Arizona State's Activity
Center probably catapulted him to the 14th overall pick in
Wednesday's NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the 6-foot-5 forward wowed the Houston Rockets, who
took him with the first of their three first-round selections.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be able to excel like he did against the competition that
was there, it made a difference,'' said Houston Coach Rudy
Tomjanovich of the recent Desert Classic pre-draft camp. ``We feel
lucky he was still around.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson was one of three Arizona players selected. Guard Mike
Bibby went to Vancouver with the second overall pick, and guard
Miles Simon landed with Orlando in the second round, the 42nd pick
overall.
</P>
<P>
   Two players considered on the bubble _ Arizona's Bennett Davison
and ASU's Jeremy Veal _ were not drafted but could sign free-agent
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson goes to a team in desperate need of athletes at the
swing positions, with Clyde Drexler retiring and Mario Elie likely
moving on through free agency.
</P>
<P>
   And the Rockets have been looking for someone who could create
his own shot ever since Sam Cassell left. They get that in
Dickerson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting to go to a team like Houston because they're
definitely looking for players to fill holes,'' he said. ``I
believe if I work hard, there will be a place for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson finished his career as Arizona's fifth-all-time
leading scorer and averaged more than 18 points his last two
seasons. He can score from the outside as well as drive to the
basket. Many scouts believed his defensive skills were underrated.
</P>
<P>
   His struggles in the last two NCAA Tournaments raised some
eyebrows, although some observers, like Suns player personnel
director Dick Van Arsdale, believe his scoring problems were more a
product of the energy he was required to expend on defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets acquired two of their three first-round picks by
trading Kevin Willis to Toronto. They also took Valparaiso guard
Bryce Drew and Mursdad Turkcan of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very surprised to see that we got the top three guys on
our wish list,'' Tomjanovich said. ``We got all-around players,
winners who will complement Hakeem (Olajuwon) and Charles (Barkley)
very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Dickerson, Simon expected to get drafted, but opinions
differed on where he would land.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting guard can score from a variety of spots on the
court, which is good news for the Magic, which was the third-worst
offensive team in the NBA last season. Part of that was due to the
63 games that Anfernee ``Penny'' Hardaway missed, but even with him
in the lineup, the Magic felt it had no ``second option'' in case
the first was having a bad night.
</P>
<P>
   Some, including Simon's father, Walt, who played in the American
Basketball Association, believe Miles should have made himself
eligible for the 1997 draft after leading Arizona to the NCAA title
and being named the Most Valuable Player of the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy with the decision I made,'' Simon said. ``Even if I
had come out, I would have had to go through the same questions.
This way, I had one more year of college and maturity behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Orlando General Manager John Gabriel: ``He impressed us on
and off the court. He'll be a nice fit here.'' &QL;

SUNS DEAL NASH IN BUSY DRAFT DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Suns met one expectation among many Wednesday, but
will have to wait and see whether others can be fulfilled with a
draft-day trade of Steve Nash to the Dallas Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns acquired 6-foot-9 forward Patrick Garrity of Notre
Dame, a 1999 first-round draft pick and two Dallas forwards, Bubba
Wells and Martin Muursepp.
</P>
<P>
   The trade was announced after several possible deals for Nash
apparently fell apart during the earoly rounds of the four-hour
draft.
</P>
<P>
   Nash, a Canadian and a reserve playmaker for the last two years,
had drawn interest from Toronto and Vancouver, which is near his
home in Victoria, B.C.
</P>
<P>
   But the Canadian teams were not willing to give up a high pick
for Nash, who was seen as a possible way to halt sliding ticket
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver kept it's No. 2 pick, which it used to take playmaker
Mike Bibby, an unproven playmaker from Shadow Mountain High and
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto kept its No. 4 pick, which it used to acquire North
Carolina swingman Vince Carter in a draft-day deal with Golden
State.
</P>
<P>
   The Warriors picked Carter at No. 5 and traded him to Toronto
for Carter's North Carolina teammate, forward Antawn Jamison, and
cash. According to NBA sources, the Suns had an interest in Carter,
considered the best athlete in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Suns General Manager Bryan Colangelo said he never received an
offer that included Carter. Colangelo indicated that some teams
were not willing to complete proposed deals for Nash, despite their
reported interest in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to say people overestimated his value when it came
to making a deal,'' said Colangelo, who also acquired UCLA shooting
guard Toby Bailey from the Los Angeles Lakers for ``future
considerations.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey was the Lakers' second-round pick, 45th overall.
</P>
<P>
   In large part, the Suns probably had no choice but to trade
Nash, the No. 15 pick in the 1996 draft. In meetings during the
last month, he and his agent, Bill Duffy, indicated that he wanted
a larger role.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted starter's minutes,'' Colangelo said. ``He wanted to
run his own team.''
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo said money was never mentioned in meetings that
included talk about a contract extension for Nash, who has one year
left on his current deal.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Suns general manager did say that starter's minutes
meant starter's money. Translation: $8 million a year. That's more
than the Suns were willing to pay a playmaker, who figured to be
the back-up to Jason Kidd.
</P>
<P>
   If the deal fell short of expectations, it was not expressed by
Suns coach Danny Ainge, who was probably Nash's biggest booster
throughout last season. Ainge applauded the trade. He said Garrity
had been projected to go be ahigher pick than No. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee picked Garrity with the 19th and German forward Dirk
Nowitzki with the ninth. The Bucks then traded both of them to
Dallas for Michigan forward Robert Traylor, who was picked No. 6 by
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks than completed the three-way-deal by sending
Garrity, Wells, Muursepp and the 1999 pick to Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``The value for a giy who had been a thrid and fourth guard is
incredible,'' said Ainge, who figures Garrity's initial role will
probably be as a small forward. ``Remember that Steve was a No. 15
pick.''
</P>
<P>
   Ainge said he liked Garrity for his toughness, shooting,
versatility and smarts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of see him as another Steve Nash in a forward's body,''
Ainge said of the Momnument, Colo., native, who played at Notre
Dame for John MacLeod, a former Suns coach.
</P>
<P>
   Nash was not available for comment. The schoolboy soccer star
was in Europe for the Wolrd Cup. However, his parent, Jean and Pat,
were in ancouver, where the draft was staged.
</P>
<P>
   His parents said before the draft that they had heard that their
son was probably headed for Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, all the wheeling-and-dealing seemed to both amuse and
surprise Garrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's cool,'' he said from Vancouver. ``But it's bizarre _ a
three-way trade. I'm dumbfounded. That's awesome. I'll never forget
this night.
</P>
<P>
   Garrity said he never had any hint that he might wind up with
the Suns. He never worked out at America West Arena in a pre-draft
visit. He said he never spoke to the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never even talked to them because they didn't have a pick,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   They do now. &QL;

BIBBY VANCOUVER BOUND AS NBA DRAFT'S 2ND PICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER _ Future millionaire Mike Bibby knows what one of his
first investments will be.
</P>
<P>
   He is going to buy an umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   But first Bibby, picked second overall in Wednesday's NBA draft,
has to look in the attic of his mother's Phoenix home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can find one,'' Bibby said. ``There might be one
tucked away at the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibby, the former Shadow Mountain High School and Arizona
player, never had much use for umbrella until the Vancouver
Grizzlies chose him. He became the highest UA player and highest
Valley player ever taken.
</P>
<P>
   He thought all along he would be headed to the Los Angeles
Clippers, who had the first pick. But the Clippers decided to take
Pacific center Michael Olowokandi instead of Bibby, a 20-year-old
point guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a great lightweight and a great heavyweight,''
Clippers General Manager Elgin Baylor said. ``You always take the
good big man over the good little guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibby said he wasn't shocked by the choice. In fact, Olowokandi
said Bibby told him minutes before the draft began that Olowokandi
would go No. 1, ``but I still didn't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibby's family was the most stunned by the Clippers passing on
him. After all, the Clippers had indicated for several weeks they
would take Bibby, who worked out for no other team.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter, Charlsie, is concerned,'' Bibby's mother,
Virginia, said. ``She's in her senior year (of high school) and
doesn't want to move.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibby said his mother will move to Vancouver, where one of the
city's most popular restaurants is The Rainy City Grill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting an umbrella will work,'' his mother said. ``He can
afford one.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's going to another country. That's what Mike was
skeptical about, especially considering his trip (with UA) to
Australia didn't go too well.''
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver General Manager Stu Jackson said he knew Bibby was
surprised by the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get the sense he's in a little bit of shock, and we have to
all be a little sensitive to that,'' Jackson said. ``He's a young
man who for a couple of months expected to go Number 1. Then, four
hours prior to the draft, he finds out maybe that wasn't going to
be, and remember that foreign country you studied in grade school.
. .''
</P>
<P>
   Bibby's apprehension ended as soon as the standing-room-only
crowd of 10,000 fans at General Motors Place in Vancouver gave him
a rousing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They greeted me well,'' said Bibby, who left UA after his
sophomore year. ``They made me feel wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a dream of mine to get picked. My heart was beating
so fast, I'm so relieved right now.''
</P>
<P>
   He said all the right things. He didn't mind falling to the
second pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I might use that as motivation,'' Bibby said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had no problem playing for an expansion team.
``They're in the NBA, so that's all that matters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He knows he's joining a team that has been a loser in each of
its three seasons. But he reminded the fans that he's always been
on championship clubs, including winning the state title at Shadow
Mountain and the NCAA crown at UA.
</P>
<P>
   When the draft began, the Grizzlies already had three point
guards. They traded one of them, Antonio Daniels, to San Antonio
later Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our players will benefit by him (Bibby) being able to get the
ball to the right places,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver Coach Brian Hill said he thinks the Grizzlies are
getting the best player in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a natural point guard, a winner and the perfect
complement to (forward) Shareef Abdur-Rahim and (center) Bryant
Reeves,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   By not going to the Clippers, Bibby also will avoid playing in
the same arena as his estranged father, Southern California Coach
Henry Bibby.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would not have bothered me,'' Bibby's mother said. ``I
don't think it would have bothered Mike, either. But now, we don't
have to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   They do have to deal with going from the dry desert to a rainy
climate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to give him some advice,'' said high school teammate
Nick Greene, an Oregon State forward who attended the draft. ``He
should stay inside and shoot. Keep working on his game. He is not
going to want to come out in the weather.'' &QL;

LESSON LEARNED: MERCURY HOLDS OF COMETS AFTER BLOWING 11- POINT
LEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Mercury promised to learn from its one-point loss
to Charlotte and applied the lesson Wednesday night to the WNBA
champion Houston Comets.
</P>
<P>
   Losing an 11-point lead, as it did against Charlotte, to fall
into another stretch thriller, Phoenix (4-1) executed on the court
and the sidelines in winning, 69-66, at America West Arena. Houston
(5-1) lost for the first time since the 1997 regular-season finale,
leaving no one in the 10-team league undefeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going to screw up this game,'' said Mercury Coach
Cheryl Miller, who accepted blame for the 72-71 loss on Sunday.
``We made some tremendous strides. I'm never a big fan of losing,
but it showed we can learn from it and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Comets went ahead, 62-61, with 2:45 left on a pair of
Sheryl Swoopes free throws, Phoenix responded with a 16-footer by
Jennifer Gillom.
</P>
<P>
   Umeki Webb, even with five fouls, jumped all over league Most
Valuable Player Cynthia Cooper, who heaved a crosscourt pass out of
bounds.
</P>
<P>
   Bridget Pettis inbounded the ball off the back of Cooper's legs,
starting a series that included a missed layup by Gillom, missed
three-pointer by Michele Timms and a rebound by Webb, who scored
for a 65-62 lead with 1:27 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Webb then fouled out, and while Cooper was making both free
throws at 1:06, Miller's assistants were vigorously in her ear,
making sure the bases left open against Charlotte were covered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned from that and kept our poise at the end,'' said
Pettis, who had a second consecutive 20-point game.
</P>
<P>
   Gillom's 7-foot fade away over Tina Thompson bumped Phoenix
ahead, 67-64, with 47.5 seconds left. Timms fouled with 39.8 left,
and the Mercury took a timeout to discuss its options before Cooper
hit two more free throws, the last of her game-high 27 points.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix smartly used the 30-second clock to get a 14-footer for
Gillom, which spun out and to Pettis before Houston's Kim Perrot
tipped the ball out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   With 9.5 seconds left, the Comets had to foul. On the second
try, after a 20-second timeout, Andrea Kuklova inbounded to Pettis,
the 1997 league free-throw percentage champion, who was tagged by
Cooper. Pettis made both attempts, leaving the Comets with 7.1
seconds to hit a three-pointer and force overtime.
</P>
<P>
   After a timeout, Swoopes inbounded from half court to Thompson,
whose shot was partially blocked by Toni Foster.
</P>
<P>
   ``She hit a big three-point against us last year and they had
run that play before,'' Foster said. ``She's one of those players
you can't forget about. I was determined she wasn't going to hit
that on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston's big three (Cooper, Swoopes and Thompson) combined for
57 points, a total nearly matched by Pettis, Gillom and Foster
(48).
</P>
<P>
   Cooper and Houston Coach Van Chancellor drew technical fouls for
protesting the officiating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to have a rhythm when you're playing rugby,'' Cooper
said. ``I don't think the referees handled themselves in a
professional manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time it (the officiating) has been that blatant
and obvious. Maybe it's because we're the defending champs and they
think we should handle that. It's a shame for women's basketball
that the only way you can get a win is like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury set a defensive tone from the opening tip,
pressuring Houston into an 0-for-4 start from the field. Even when
the Comets busted into 7-2 and 17-11 leads, Phoenix reeled them
back by holding Cooper scoreless for almost 16 minutes and limiting
the big three to 25 combined first-half points.
</P>
<P>
   Down, 18-16, the Mercury staged a 9-0 run that included Gillom's
off balance 7-footer over Thompson and a three-pointer by backup
point guard Kristi Harrower. Phoenix extended the run to 12-2 on a
three-point play by Michelle Griffiths to lead, 28-20, with 3:41
until halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, showing the poise of a champion, ended the half on an
11-3 run. &QL;

NO ROOM AT THE CUP FOR U.S. SOCCER TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NANTES, FRANCE - English hooligans rioted in Marseilles. German
soccer thugs battled police in Lens.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are rampaging in Nantes. No chocolate eclair is safe.
</P>
<P>
   The United States isn't going to win the World Cup, but we have
a real chance to take the sportsmanship trophy. After Germany
blanked us in Paris, we didn't riot. We went shopping. Losing to
Iran was galling, but you didn't see Americans throwing rocks and
bottles and trading punches with the gendarmes.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. soccer fans aren't inclined to riot. Most Americans in
France for the World Cup are preocupied with the daily challenges
that arise unexpectedly in a foreign country. Like spending 20
minutes searching the Renault owner's manual, written in French,
looking for an illustration _ any clue _ that identifies the button
that unlatches the blankety-blank gas cap cover on my rental car.
</P>
<P>
   The language barrier makes simple tasks difficult. In Paris, one
exasperated American wasted the better part of a day walking
aimlessly around the city and inquiring, in his best French,
``Where is the Eiffel Tower?''
</P>
<P>
   Parisians looked at him blankly, or with amusement. Wary mothers
shepherded their children away from the stranger.
</P>
<P>
   Unknown to him, the visitor wasn't asking for directions. He was
making a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of ``Where is the Eiffel Tower?'' he announced to
everyone he approached, his voice rising in frustration, ``I ``am''
the Eiffel Tower.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. World Cup team can relate to the misadventure. Our
players are polite, sincere, well meaning. Like summer tourists,
they came to France determined to do everything they could to make
this a fulfilling and memorable experience. Their trip has fallen
well short of expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four years of work, and it's all over in a week,'' U.S. star
Cobi Jones said. That says it all.
</P>
<P>
   Team USA scored one goal in two matches. Today, the Americans
play what for them is an exhibition against Yugoslavia. The
Yugoslavs are pumped. The game means a lot. They desperately want
to finish first in Group F, ahead of Germany. Yugoslavia settled
for a 2-2 draw with the Germans after blowing a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Coach Steve Sampson (who is expected to be fired) will
appeal to his players' competitive spirit and team pride. But even
if the Americans win, and they aren't expected to, they can't
advance to the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Our team hasn't stirred much passion. American soccer fans paint
their faces. They cheer the red, white and blue. But you don't see
impromptu pep rallies or parades. Other citizens of the world
celebrate night and day, marching arm in arm through narrow
cobblestone streets, waving their country's flag. They dance. Sing.
Bang drums. Blow whistles. Toot horns. Stop traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil has advanced to the next round. So has Italy. So has
France. The party atmosphere builds.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans have worked hard, but the talent isn't good enough
to win. So after playing only three matches, as they did eight
years ago in Italy, they will return home as spectators, feeling as
empty as the New York sportswriter who ran to catch a press bus
during the Winter Olympics in Albertville, France.
</P>
<P>
   Breathless, the reporter climbed aboard. His eyes searched the
rows of seats. Every seat was filled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zee boos, eet eez foool?'' he asked the obvious. The writer
couldn't speak a word of French. For some reason, he must have
thought the driver, who spoke no English, could understand him and
sympathize with his plight if he addressed him with a bad accent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zer eez no ruem for ``me''?'' he asked. I recognized the
voice. It was the cartoon skunk, Pepe Le Pew.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, pal. No ruem.
</P>
<P>
   ``C'est la vie''. &QL;

MOON VALLEY STAR MAKES UA GRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Richard Jefferson crammed correspondence courses,
sacrificed basketball camps for summer school and made himself
academically eligible to play at Arizona next season by finishing
strong in the classroom at Moon Valley High.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson, a ``Parade'' and McDonald's All-American who led the
Rockets to the 4A state title last season, said he got four B's and
a C in his final semester, giving him the required grade-point
average in core courses to play as a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   There was some doubt whether the 6-foot-7 forward would be
eligible after what he called ``messing up badly'' in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all holding our breath,'' said Art Dye, director of
the Arizona Stars, a club program in which Jefferson played. ``He
did a great job. We all know he's not stupid. He's very bright. He
applied himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson said he attended summer school before his sophomore
year to make up incompleted courses from his first year.
</P>
<P>
   He took correspondence courses throughout his prep career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of hard,'' he said. ``Messing up my freshman year
messed up everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew what I was doing the last couple of years. I did what I
had to do. Now I'm just trying to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson is spending the summer working out with a personal
trainer in Phoenix. He said he may spend some time in Tucson in
early July before working as a counselor in the Nike Camp in
Indianapolis, where he emerged as one of the top prep players in
the country last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between my freshman and sophomore years, I didn't play much
basketball because I was going to summer school,'' Jefferson said.
``That hurt me basketballwise. I still think I'm a year behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson scored only two points in the McDonald's All-American
game last spring but said he felt he played one of his more
complete games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played hard. I hit the boards hard. A lot of guys were just
worried about scoring. It's hard for me. I had a great team around
me this year. It's hard to go out there and look out for myself.
I'm used to getting things done off the team atmosphere.'' &QL;

TROON GOLF, NORMAN FORM ALLIANCE  
 WILL PERMIT EXPANSION INTO NEW FOREIGN MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL HUFFMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Troon Golf, a Scottsdale-based management company, is
jumping into the high seas with Greg Norman and his Great White
Shark Enterprises in a joint venture that also includes
Australia-based Medallist Golf.
</P>
<P>
   The big splash by Troon Golf, which will be announced Friday in
New York, will bring Norman's design skills to Scottsdale and allow
Troon Golf to expand into Asia, Australia and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Troon Golf President Dana Garmany said the formation of the new
company, called Medallist-Troon, includes Macquarie Bank,
Australia's leading property investment institution, which along
with Great White Shark Enterprises forms Medallist Golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``While our partnership with Greg is limited to Asia, Australia
and the Middle East, we will become the preferred management
company for his golf courses in the rest of the world, while
operating from our offices in Scottsdale,'' Garmany said. ``This
arrangement is not an exclusive for either party but will allow us
to further our working relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Garmany also announced that Norman has been retained to design
the new Stonehaven Golf Club in the northeasternmost part of
Scottsdale. The 700- to 900-acre project, which should be approved
sometime in July, is scheduled to open in late 1999. It will be
Norman's first effort in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Garmany said several other projects are under way
internationally, mostly in Asia, where a struggling economy has
opened the door to several courses in dire need of completion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel there is a real opportunity there, and the best part
is that no one in the golf world is bigger in Asia than Greg
Norman,'' Garmany said. ``In fact, he's probably more popular in
Asia than he is in his homeland of Australia, if that's possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Garmany said Norman will build the courses, and Troon-Medallist
will manage them with the same ``member-for-a-day'' philosophy
employed by Troon North, the flagship course of Troon Golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we decided to move into the Asian, Australian and Middle
East markets, we felt it prudent to find partners who had expertise
in dealing with local law and custom,'' said Garmany, noting that
those three countries are Medallist strongholds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Therefore, we will operate in North America, South America,
Europe and Africa under Troon Golf, and in Asia, Australia and the
Middle East under the banner of Medallist-Troon.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Stinger of Troon Golf has been named vice president of
operations for Medallist-Troon, with an emphasis on building
contacts in those regions.
</P>
<P>
   Norman has built courses in 12 countries and has five projects
under way in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Troon Golf, which has been in Arizona for the past 10 years,
owns or manages 40 golf courses in four countries and 10 states.
</P>
<P>
   Among Troon Golf's portfolio are such well-known layouts as
Turnberry in Scotland, Innisbrook in Florida, Mission Hills in
California and Castle Pines and Tamarron in Colorado. In Arizona,
it includes Troon North, Legend Trail, Talking Stick and La Paloma.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our expectations from a golf experience level are just as high
as Greg's expectations are as a player and course designer,''
Garmany said.
</P>
<P>
   Norman is devoting his time to course design and rehabilitation
after undergoing shoulder surgery that has sidelined him for the
rest of the 1998 season. He has won 18 titles on the PGA Tour and
another 60 worldwide, including the 1986 and '93 British Opens.
</P>
<P>
   This might be the perfect fit, as Norman's '86 British Open
victory _ his first major championship _ was played at Turnberry,
which was purchased by Troon Golf late last year. &QL;

NO ORD- INARY DESTINATION  
 EASY-ACCESS PEAK OFFERS COOL, SCENIC GETAWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard to believe that a 50-mile drive from Phoenix, the vast
majority on pavement, could take you to 7,000 feet and the tall
pine country.
</P>
<P>
   That's especially interesting now that temperatures in the
desert are beginning to soar.
</P>
<P>
   But there stands Mount Ord and its 7,128-foot summit. If you've
driven to Payson on the Beeline Highway (Arizona 87), you must have
seen it. The mighty Four Peaks to the south stand 500 feet higher,
and from the distance are a more prominent landmark. They also
offer a larger area to roam.
</P>
<P>
   But they also are much more difficult to reach, and it takes
considerably more time.
</P>
<P>
   Ord is easy to spot to the east of the highway. It's the one
that looks like a porcupine on top. Besides sporting a U.S. Forest
Service tower for spotting wildfires, the summit also is glutted
with communication towers, some of which look like pieces from the
Starship Enterprise. Come to think of it, perhaps they are.
</P>
<P>
   Access to the mountain can be as difficult as one wants to make
it. Both access points are beyond Sunflower and near the summit of
Slate Creek Pass. For vehicles, at least, one Forest Service access
road is tolerable. The other is more suited for hikers.
</P>
<P>
   It's getting hot at 8:30 a.m. on Monday. Ed Fouts likes it that
way. Fouts, 83, avoids air conditioning as often as possible. He
has his window down, enjoying the weather. The driver isn't so sure
this is the way to go. The vehicle isn't equipped with an air
conditioning compressor for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   But the drive up State Route 87 is pleasant. The new four-lane
sections of the highway make the drive so much more relaxed. At
about mile marker 224, Fouts points out the turnoff to the right.
The turnoff isn't marked, but the path is Forest Road 626. It's the
road used by technicians for the communications systems atop Mount
Ord.
</P>
<P>
   This is a relatively new stretch of road. The original road
farther north (FR 27) takes a shorter path to the summit, but it
also is steeper. It no longer is maintained, and even some
all-terrain-vehicle drivers have tense moments on this trail.
Hikers, however, often park at the bottom and follow this trail
five or so miles to the summit.
</P>
<P>
   The better road isn't at all difficult for a high-clearance
vehicle. Cars, too, can travel this road, but it's rough. To a
point, it is maintained. Erosion has created some areas that need
fill dirt to cover the deeply imbedded rock outcroppings. But
still, an automobile driver willing to go easy can make it. The two
roads join several miles below the summit, and the remainder is
maintained.
</P>
<P>
   The better road is longer than the other. It requires a drive of
eight miles or so to reach a parking area about three-quarters of a
mile below the summit. At that point, a gate closes the road to the
summit to any traffic besides Forest Service personnel or those
service communications facilities at the summit.
</P>
<P>
   The trip toward that parking area is scenic. Fouts, who most
often drives his Jeep on such trips, has an infrequent chance to
look for wildlife. He wants to see a bear, as he has before in this
area. He doesn't this day.
</P>
<P>
   The grass is beginning to turn brown in the dry heat, but bushes
at the lower level still look lush. Once the pines are reached, the
wind blows cool. Fout remarks how strange it is to reach such
comfortable temperatures as heat below become sweltering.
</P>
<P>
   At the parking area, during a pause to eat, Fouts, rather
sheepishly, says he needs to put on a jacket. His companion isn't
cold but is refreshed by the coolness.
</P>
<P>
   Fouts will wait on his companion while the latter hikes to the
summit. The road makes footing good, but the incline causes lung
pains. The road divides again. A sign says the left fork goes to
the fire tower, the other to the electronics area. The left fork is
much steeper. And both forks go to the same area.
</P>
<P>
   This is a beautiful hike, as was the drive into the pines. Some
wildflowers still are blooming, and the large New Mexico locust
bushes along the roadway continue to produce large clusters of
violet blooms. The locusts are considered to be noxious plants
because of the large quantities of water they consume, but their
blooms, now in a declining stage, are beautiful. These plants most
often are found along higher-elevation roadsides where moisture
gathers after rain. They are a native plant to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The summit is even more spectacular than the plants. On one
side, there is a clear view of Roosevelt Lake, Tonto Basin
communities and Four Peaks to the south.
</P>
<P>
   The other side is even better, offering views over the Mazatzal
Mountains of both Horseshoe and Bartlett lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the Forest Service roads, hiking opportunities appear
to be limited. Inclines from the mountain are severe, better suited
for goats than humans.
</P>
<P>
   But for a short day trip that offers plenty in scenery, this one
has a lot to offer. And what a way to escape the heat. &QL;

AS AN AGENT, LAWTON EXCEEDS EXPECTATIONS  
 REPRESENTS 30 NHL PLAYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He's young and aggressive, armed with a mission and an uncanny
resemblance to actor Tom Cruise. Ironically, he's also a hot-shot
sports agent, a role recently portrayed by Cruise in the movie
``Jerry Mcguire''.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I get that a lot,'' Brian Lawton said modestly with an
``aw, shucks'' tone in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess there are a few similarities. . . . But I don't think
you'll ever see me in the showers talking to one of my clients like
he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably not. But chances are you'll be seeing, reading and
hearing an awful lot about Lawton in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The first U.S.-born player ever selected as the first overall
choice in the NHL draft _ Minnesota took him No. 1 in 1983 _ Lawton
is emerging as one of hockey's top representatives since retiring
from the sport only five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Before he walked away, he also spent a couple years in Phoenix
as a key member of the minor league Roadrunners. Little did he know
at the time that someday he and his corporation would be handling
the contracts of nearly 30 NHL stars, including a few who play in
Phoenix for the Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty much been one steady climb. I haven't stopped to
take a breath yet,'' said Lawton, 33, a part-time Valley resident
who represents Coyotes defensemen Deron Quint and Keith Carney, who
recently decided to change agents. Lawton's new partner, former NHL
goalie Mike Liut, represents Coyotes defenseman Norm Maciver.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bizarre. I was extremely anxious when I was getting ready
to retire,'' Lawton said. ``I loved playing, and I never thought
I'd find anything else in life I liked doing as much. But I can
honestly say I enjoy this just as much. Looking back, though, I
curse myself for not enjoying all the free time I had.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm working 10 times harder now than I ever did.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most hockey agents, Lawton will be extra busy this weekend,
when some of the top prospects he counsels are expected to be
selected in Saturday's NHL entry draft in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan's Mike Van Ryan and Colorado College's Paul Manning,
for example, are rated as the 15th- and 38th-best players in the
draft. A recent client, University of Minnesota center Erik
Rasmussen, was chosen by the Buffalo Sabres with the seventh
overall pick in the 1996 draft.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Lawton is moving his way up the charts. He
recently upped his clout by selling his private company, Lawton
Sport, and merging with Advantage International, a firm that
represents sports stars from Steffi Graf to David Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Lawton is director of the company's hockey division.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a funny business,'' said veteran hockey agent Bob Murray
of Boston. ``Agents don't usually talk about other agents. It can
be so cutthroat. But I think Brian has really made an impact since
coming into the business very recently. He's got decent clients,
and from what I can tell, he's doing a decent job.''
</P>
<P>
   He literally landed his first client the day after he retired
from the San Jose Sharks. It was defenseman Tom Kurvers, now a
scout for the Coyotes. Lawton got him a lucrative three-year deal
with the New York Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Best contract I ever signed,'' Kurvers said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawton's NHL career never really lived up to all the hype. He
scored 112 goals and 266 points in parts of nine seasons with
Minnesota, the New York Rangers, Hartford, Quebec, Boston and San
Jose. ``The Hockey'' ``News'' labeled him as the worst No. 1 pick
in NHL history.
</P>
<P>
   Players selected behind him that year included Pat LaFontaine
(No. 3), Steve Yzerman (No. 4) and Tom Barrasso (No. 5), not to
mention Cam Neely (No. 9) and Claude Lemieux (No. 26).
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes General Manager Bobby Smith, who is negotiating with
Lawton on a new pact for Carney, a restricted Group II free agent,
was a teammate of Lawton's that first year in Minnesota. He
remembers the pressure Lawton was under.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came into the NHL straight out of high school, and in
hindsight, he probably should have waited and gone with LaFontaine
to the '84 Olympics,'' Smith said. ``Brian just wasn't a part of
it. We had a new coach in Minnesota, a guy who was coaching to win,
not develop a high school player from Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got traded to Montreal about 10 games into the season, but I
knew it was going to be a tough year for Brian. He was used to
being the star player, and he wasn't getting the ice time.''
</P>
<P>
   Most coaches and general managers now agree there is no sense
trying to rush an 18- or 19-year-old player into the NHL. Usually,
they're just not ready.
</P>
<P>
   That new mentality could be the reason why fewer and fewer high
school players are getting drafted. Since Lawton went No. 1 in '83,
only seven prep stars have been first-round picks. One of the last
was the Coyotes' Keith Tkachuk, the 19th overall pick in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   That year, a total of 57 high school players were drafted. But
the numbers have dropped steadily. In 1995, there were only two. In
1996, there were six. Last year, there were four.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until you're 20 or 21, you haven't missed a damn thing in the
NHL,'' Lawton said, noting that Rasmussen and others like him
returned to college after getting drafted rather than rush to the
pros right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get me wrong, being 18 and the first American player to
go Number 1 was a big honor for me. But it was the wrong decision
to jump right in. It was devastating.'' &QL;

TRIPLE BY GONZALEZ SINKS D-BACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX So much for esthetics. Forget the comforts of home. One
of those cute, little picnic overhangs that jut out in center field
at Bank One Ballpark turned treacherous for the Diamondbacks on
Wednesday, aiding and abetting a 3-2 loss to the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   With two out and Mark McLemore on first base for the Rangers in
the eighth inning, Texas slugger Juan Gonzalez launched a shot to
center off Willie Blair. Devon White went back to the wall and
might have caught the ball, except that it hit the overhang to the
right of the batter's eye and bounced on to the field.
</P>
<P>
   The score had been tied at 2, but no longer. McLemore, who had
three hits, came in with what proved to be the winning run.
Gonzalez, who tripled, now has 93 RBI, tops in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   The play broke up a pitcher's duel between Blair and the
Rangers' Rick Helling. Blair lost his 11th game, most in the
majors, despite giving up just three runs in 7 innings to the big
leagues' highest-scoring team. Helling, who gave up five hits and
one earned run in 7 innings, won his 11th, tying teammate Aaron
Sele for the major league lead.
</P>
<P>
   Helped by a throwing error by relief ace John Wetteland, the
Diamondbacks had a chance in the ninth. But with runners on first
and second and one out, pinch-hitter Mike Robertson fouled out and
another pinch-hitter, Brent Brede, hit into a game-ending force
play.
</P>
<P>
   Helling came in averaging six runs a game in support, and it
looked as if the Rangers would provide him more than that in the
top of the first. McLemore singled with one out and Blair walked
Rusty Greer. That brought up Gonzalez, who seems to have a chance
at Hack Wilson's once-impregnable record of 190 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez promptly singled to score McLemore and make it 1-0.
With runners on first and third and one out, things appeared to be
getting ugly early for Blair. But Blair got Will Clark to hit a
grounder to second baseman Andy Fox, who tagged the base himself
and fired to first for a double play.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks threatened in the bottom of the inning when
Travis Lee drew a two-out walk and Matt Williams singled. It went
no further because David Dellucci's shot to center field was caught
by Tom Goodwin.
</P>
<P>
   Blair gave up a one-out double in the second to Kevin Elster _
who went hitless in the Rangers' 16-5 win over the Diamondbacks on
Tuesday _ without suffering further harm. But in the third,
McLemore, a former Valley resident, re-introduced himself to the
fans in right field by sending a Blair pitch into the seats for a
solo home run and a 2-0 Rangers lead.
</P>
<P>
   Blair escaped a big jam in the fourth _ runners on first and
second with none out _ when Elster hit into a double play and
Fernando Tatis grounded out, and helped himself in the fifth by
picking Goodwin off second base after the speedy Ranger stole his
25th base of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Diamondbacks offered little resistance to
Helling, who had won his last three starts. Helling gave up
harmless singles in the second and third and retired the side in
order in the fourth. Then he and the Rangers were victimized by an
extremely productive strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't Kelly Stinnett's whiff leading off the fifth. It
happened after Blair singled to snap an 0-for-24 skid and Andy Fox
doubled off the wall in right. White swung at a Helling pitch in
the dirt for strike 3, but the ball got past catcher Pudge
Rodriguez. Blair scored from the third and Rodriguez's throw to
Helling covering the plate arrived in the vicinity of Blair's feet
just as he was scoring.
</P>
<P>
   The ball skipped free of the tangled mess, allowing Fox (who
started out on second, remember) to score and tie the game at 2.
White ended up at second base. But on the next pitch, hoping to
catch the Rangers still in a frazzled state, White tried to steal
third and was gunned down by Rodriguez. It wasn't even close.
</P>
<P>
   But the strange stuff wasn't finished. Lee walked with one out
in the bottom of the eighth. Danny Patterson relieved Helling and
was greeted by Williams, who hit a rocket to Tatis at third. Tatis
gloved the ball, but then dropped it. Lee, who had held up, was
forced at second and Williams, who stopped running after Tatis
apparently caught the ball, was out at first. &QL;

BIBLE FOR MANAGERS EXISTS, BUT INTERPRETATIONS VARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It didn't matter whether you were an old-fashioned purist or a
space-aged high-tech baseball fan, just about everyone weighed in
with an opinion concerning one of the most controversial managerial
moves in decades.
</P>
<P>
   When Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter elected to
intentionally walk San Francisco's Barry Bonds with two outs and
the bases loaded in the bottom of the ninth inning, forcing in a
run and putting the tying run at third base, the baseball world
couldn't stop talking about the move for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book I learned from says you play the situations in front
of you,'' St. Louis Manager Tony La Russa said. ``And situations
are constantly changing. All you do is try to be aware of
everything you can in order to pick up an edge here or there.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no easy answer to what the book is. Mostly you have
to be able to walk into the clubhouse accepting who beat you.
That's why Buck's move in San Francisco made all the sense in the
world. You can't walk up to an owner or fans or the media saying
you're going by the book and keep losing. You won't have your job
very long.''
</P>
<P>
   Even now, nearly a month later, Showalter's move still makes its
way into many conversations. For Showalter and the Diamondbacks,
the unconventional move paid off because the next batter, Brent
Mayne, lined out to right field to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest reason Showalter's gutsy move remains a hot topic is
because Arizona's manager went against everything baseball's
``book'' says you should do.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is no real book. Nothing's ever literally been
written on paper. The book is merely a compilation of baseball
strategies that have been used in the 129 years since professional
baseball began.
</P>
<P>
   After so many years, it's fairly well known which moves work
more than others. It's why a left-handed pitcher is rarely brought
in to face a right-handed batter, or a club should never play its
outfield shallow when leading late in a game.
</P>
<P>
   These are called playing the percentages, which more often than
not will result in winning the countless small battles that take
place during a game.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, going solely by the book also could mean certain
defeat. A manager has to have a feel for his players and who is hot
and who is not.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't become a prisoner to the percentages or a
computer,'' Showalter said. ``I don't think the human element will
ever be taken out of the game. At least I hope not.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Montreal Manager Felipe Alou, with runners at
second and third, intentionally walked the right-handed hitting
Andre Dawson and allowed his right-handed relief pitcher to face
the left-handed-hitting Derrick May, a move that strictly goes
against the book.
</P>
<P>
   But the move paid off and after the game, a reporter asked Alou
whether he felt lucky since he got away with going against the
book?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Alou answered. ``I went by the book. The book I have
says Andre Dawson has 400 home runs and Derrick May has two. I used
a different book.''
</P>
<P>
   Some managers have been known to stick by the computer printouts
and stay with the percentages at all times, leaving their baseball
instincts out of their managing equation. Most of those managers
wind up fired within a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when a manager has the kind of club that needs little
tinkering, he can be accused of not doing enough. Those were the
cases with Cito Gaston during years he won back-to-back World
Series championships with Toronto and with Mike Hargrove, who has
guided the Indians to two of the past three World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the managing you do is not managing,'' Showalter
said. ``People always got on Cito, but he let that team play. Same
thing with Hargrove. You're dealing with humans and there is
day-to-day interaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unfortunate part is that some guys have to establish
themselves as managers before they start gambling. I'd like to
think I gambled my first years but in all honesty, I probably
didn't. If you're always going the orthodox way, you're not always
going to give your club its best chance to win.'' &QL;

ANGELS, DODGERS HEAD IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The battle ground is Southern California, and the unthinkable is
slowly happening.
</P>
<P>
   The Anaheim Angels, who play in Orange County, have lived in the
long shadow cast by their neighbor to the north, the mighty Los
Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   In a span of one month, the Dodgers have managed to detonate two
of the biggest bombs to rock the baseball world in some time,
culminating with the double-firing of Manager  &UR; Bill Russell and
General Manager
 &UR; Fred Claire on Sunday night, the same day former GM  &UR; Al Campanis,
who never had a racist bone in his body, died.
</P>
<P>
   But interim GM  &UR; Tommy Lasorda, one of the least genuine people
ever to wear a major league uniform, started plotting for this day
more than a year ago, when Fox officials first showed serious
interest in buying one of the most storied franchises in all of
sports.
</P>
<P>
   This is a job that Lasorda, who as manager never seemed to take
blame when the Dodgers did poorly but always was ready to take
credit during the good times, has wanted for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda had been whispering into the green Fox folks' ears about
all the changes the Dodgers would need to make their way back to
the top of the heap.
</P>
<P>
   Some within the Dodgers system strongly believe that Lasorda was
the driving force to push Russell and Claire out of the picture.
Back-stabbing is the phrase that comes up most often.
</P>
<P>
   These Dodgers, as talented a collection of players and pitchers
as there is, are even thinking about changing one of the most
famous logos in the game, as well as one of the most traditional
and gorgeous uniforms around.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, the Angels have quietly risen to the top of the
American League West standings, and, amazingly, they are the ones
who now seem to have the model franchise in the greater LA area.
</P>
<P>
   With  &UR; Tim Salmon, Darin Erstad, Garrett Anderson, Jim Edmonds,
Gary
 &UR; DiSarcina and  &UR; Troy Percival, the Angels have built a first-place
club with mostly home-grown talent. The Dodgers, traditionally
known as a club that loved bragging about its farm system, is
heading the other way.
</P>
<P>
   It's shaping up as a battle between media superpowers Fox and
Disney, and the cute little mouse is drawing the raves. &QL; 
The root of it all &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Say one thing for San Diego's  &UR; Kevin Brown: He's one tough dude.
After thinking he was just visiting the dentist for a regular
checkup Tuesday morning, Brown learned he needed root canal
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than waiting another day, when he didn't have to pitch,
Brown elected to have the oral surgery that morning. He then went
out and pitched six innings in leading the Padres to a 7-3 victory
over Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pain was not that bad, but I had no legs under me,'' Brown
said. ``I was tired even before I went out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach  &UR; Dave Stewart said: ``You can't ask for anything
better from a human under the circumstances. I've never seen
that.'' &QL; 
Tabling the former closer &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's  &UR; Jose Mesa, who couldn't hold a ninth-inning lead in
Game 7 of last year's World Series, has been booed mercilessly at
Jacobs Field lately. The Indians have lost seven games in the
opponents' last at-bats, and Mesa has been on the mound in four of
those.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not being critical of the fans,'' Cleveland Manager  &UR; Mike
 &UR; Hargrove said. ``But the (fans') reaction to Jose puts him on the
defensive, and that makes it tough for him to pitch that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a player, Jose needs to deal with it (the booing) and get
beyond it. I'm not coming down on the fans for booing him, but
we've all got to recognize that it has an effect on Jose's
mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   Mesa is available in a trade and  &UR; Mike Jackson remains
Cleveland's closer. &QL; 
Do it right &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once again the geniuses running baseball have managed to bungle
the 1999 schedule. The preliminary, and still somewhat tentative,
schedule for next year has interleague games once again.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that for the third consecutive year, the
divisions will play only among themselves, meaning West vs. West,
Central vs. Central and East vs. East.
</P>
<P>
   The original idea behind interleague play was so fans in every
city would have the opportunity to see players from every club. If
this keep up, the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox will never
make it to Bank One Ballpark for regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have kind of an advantage in our league. Being in the East,
we get to play the (AL) teams with a lot of history to them,''
Atlanta Manager  &UR; Bobby Cox said. ``Interleague play hasn't been so
great everywhere, but the teams that are in the East, they may draw
a few more people.'' &QL;

EMBREE EMBRACES OPPORTUNITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - A couple of weeks ago, Alan Embree and his wife,
Melanie, were casually talking in Atlanta and he mentioned that
playing for the Diamondbacks wouldn't be all that bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a rumor that was going around or anything, I was
just thinking I'd get an opportunity to pitch a little more,''
Embree said.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly wasn't a wish _ no one wishes to go from a division
leader to a cellar-dweller _ but his thought came true Tuesday when
the Braves dealt the 28-year-old left-hander to the Diamondbacks
for right-handed reliever Russ Springer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised, but I'm happy to be here,'' Embree said. ``I
knew they were going to make a move, but I thought it would be one
of our right-handers going. I don't have a bad thing to say about
Atlanta. But I'll get my innings here and a chance to show people
how much I've learned.''
</P>
<P>
   When Embree and Kenny Lofton went to the Braves in the deal that
sent David Justice and Marquis Grissom to Cleveland in March of
1997, he said he was a ``confident one-pitch pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd throw one inning, maybe two hitters and throw the fastball
predominantly,'' said Embree, who pitched successfully in four
World Series games for Cleveland in 1995. He also saw postseason
action for Cleveland in '96 and last year with Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Under Braves pitching coach Leo Mazzone, Embree solidified his
slider and learned a change-up. He also said he soaked up
considerable knowledge from the best starting rotation in the game
_ Greg Maddux, John Smoltz, Tom Glavine and Denny Neagle.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't learn from those guys, then you're brain-dead,''
he said. ``They're a fountain of information. If you can't pick
their brain and learn something, you're just not trying to be a
pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, Atlanta's starters seldom need help from the
bullpen. After a strong season last year (3-1 with a 2.54 ERA in 66
appearances), he has appeared in only 20 games this year, posting a
1-0 record with a 4.34 ERA in 18 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'll get a chance here to show how competitive I can
be,'' Embree said. ``If you go out every day, it keeps you sharp. I
was getting stale just because they had such a strong starting
rotation and because they didn't know which way they wanted to go
in the bullpen.''
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter is willing to go with anyone
in the bullpen who can show consistency. It very well could turn
Embree into more than just a situational reliever, although he has
been stingy against left-handed batters, holding them to a .221
average in 137 major league games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been in the fire before and understands the
accountability of a major league relief pitcher's job,'' Showalter
said. ``We didn't get him just because he's left-handed or just to
get out left-handed hitters. We don't have that luxury this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a quality arm. We think it's a step in the right
direction and believe he has a chance to be a big piece of the
puzzle here.'' &QL;

KLASSEN GETTING HANG OF 2ND BASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The  &UR; Danny Klassen Experiment is a success, and it might only be
a matter of time before the Diamondbacks see the results firsthand.
</P>
<P>
   Klassen is playing second base for the Tucson Sidewinders and is
playing it as if it were his normal position. Until a couple of
weeks ago, he was exclusively a shortstop, although he had logged
practice time at second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danny's a great athlete, not just a good athlete _ and I don't
use the word `great' often _ who can do a lot of things,'' said
 &UR; Mel
 &UR; Didier, Diamondbacks director of player development.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we asked him to play center field, he might be one of the
best in the organization. He's picked up second base real well.''
</P>
<P>
   With veteran  &UR; Jay Bell seemingly entrenched at shortstop,
Klassen's immediate future with the Diamondbacks would appear to be
at second base. Then again, there were rumblings that Bell might
eventually be moved to second. Right now, utility man  &UR; Andy Fox is
getting most of the action at second base for the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what happens, the versatility can't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just increases (Klassen's) value to the organization if he
plays short and second,'' said  &UR; Tommy Jones, director of minor
league operations.
</P>
<P>
   Klassen isn't the only player learning a new position.  &UR; Edwin
Diaz, formerly a second baseman, is playing shortstop and third
base, as is
 &UR; Hanley Frias, who is recovering from hand surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Tucson Manager  &UR; Chris Speier said Klassen's transition is
proceeding smoothly because of athleticism, intelligence and
willingness to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy,'' Speier said.
</P>
<P>
   He should know. Speier was one of the better fielders at
shortstop for many years with the San Francisco Giants before
learning second base later on to prolong his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems to pick up things real quickly. It's been easy. You
always need to fine-tune, but for the most part, he's shown he can
make the transition.''
</P>
<P>
   Klassen already had shown marked improvement at shortstop from
last season, when he had a miserable year for the Milwaukee
Brewers' Double-A club in El Paso. But what grabs everyone's
attention is his bat. Klassen hit .331 at El Paso and has shown
little drop-off at Triple-A, batting .304 with nine homers and 40
RBIs through Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Supposedly, Milwaukee Brewers owner (and interim commissioner)
 &UR; Bud
 &UR; Selig was ready to choke somebody in his organization when the
Diamondbacks took Klassen with the fifth pick of the second round
of the expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has All-Star ability,'' Didier said. ``I've been in this
game for 45 years and I've called a few shots in my lifetime, and
I'm not afraid to say that . . . Klassen is a thoroughbred.'' &QL; 
Brief stints &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Frias had 11 stolen bases in only 15 games through Tuesday. He
has been caught just once.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher  &UR; Jeff Suppan, who will pitch for the Diamondbacks on
Friday against Seattle, is 1-1 with a 3.78 ERA for the Sidewinders.
</P>
<P>
   High Desert got off to a fast second-half start in the
California League, winning five of its first six games and four
straight through Tuesday. &QL;

MILLS SIGNS CONTRACT WITH TWINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former Arizona State pitcher Ryan Mills wanted to be a
professional baseball player, and he didn't want to spend a lot of
time with the pesky details of contract negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   He got his wish.
</P>
<P>
   Mills signed a contract Wednesday with the Minnesota Twins and
will report today to the organization's rookie league team in Ft.
Myers, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The sixth overall pick in the amateur draft this month, Mills
received a $2 million signing bonus, according to sources close to
the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talks were positive, and we were able to find a middle
ground quickly,'' said Jeff Moorad, Mills' agent. ``We're very
happy to put the process behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   Moorad's dealings with the Twins have not always been congenial.
As the agent for Travis Lee, a Twins draft pick two years ago,
Moorad found a loophole that allowed Lee to become a free agent and
sign with the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Mills was drafted by the New York Yankees out of Horizon High
School but turned down a $575,000 signing bonus to attend ASU.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys spend their whole summer trying to get their
deals done,'' Mills said. ``I'm just excited to get down to Fort
Myers and get my feet wet.''
</P>
<P>
   A junior last season, the left-handed Mills finished with an 8-4
record and a 4.68 ERA. In 115 innings, Mills had 140 strikeouts and
54 walks.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his contract, Mills will attend major league spring
training next year and will donate $7,500 to Horizon's baseball
program, $7,500 to ASU's and $10,000 to a Twins charity in
Minneapolis. He also will receive $30,000 to help him earn his
college degree. &QL;

VAN EXEL TRADED TO DENVER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ The Lakers ended their five-year, sometimes-stormy
relationship with Nick Van Exel on Wednesday, trading the emotional
All-Star to the Denver Nuggets for second-year forward Tony Battie
and the rights to rookie point guard Tyronn Lue.
</P>
<P>
   Van Exel's Lakers career had seen him go from second-round
sleeper in 1993 to bona fide All-Star this season, with an
occasional temper tantrum in between. But a pair of troublesome
knees late this season and a fade in the playoffs, combined with
the emergence of point guard Derek Fisher, made Van Exel
expendable.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, despite a 61-win season, the Lakers were looking to
change the team's chemistry in the wake of being swept in the
conference finals by the Utah Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things like this are very, very difficult. I really like Nick
Van Exel a lot, but I just think that, for all of us, a change of
scenery would be good for everyone,'' said Jerry West, Lakers
executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a feeling internally sometimes you get, that maybe
the same faces are not always good to have together,'' West said.
``Looking at him, there were times when he didn't look like he was
a very happy player for us. And maybe the pressure of playing,
where we expect a lot of success ... maybe that didn't work for
him. I'm not sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Exel and his representatives were not available Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Agent James Bryant told the Daily News last week that Van Exel
wanted input on any trade and that there were some teams he might
refuse to report to. West said there were no indications Van Exel
would hold up the trade.
</P>
<P>
   If that's true, all that remains is for all three players to
pass physical examinations. Van Exel is presumed to be healthy, his
chronically sore left knee notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   The trade, consummated at 9 p.m., came after the completion of
the NBA draft and completed an evening in which the Lakers acquired
five players and traded two.
</P>
<P>
   They selected Minnesota swingman Sam Jacobson with the 26th pick
in the first round and grabbed Cincinnati forward Ruben Patterson
and UCLA guard Toby Bailey in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the Lakers dealt Bailey to the Phoenix Suns for
future considerations, then made the long-anticipated Van Exel
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always sad to see one of our guys go,'' said coach Del
Harris, who forged a working relationship with Van Exel despite
some very public spats with him. ``Trading is always a hard thing,
particularly when you've been with a player a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Exel and Elden Campbell have been shopped around the league
for the past month, and the Lakers spent much of Wednesday
attempting various trades to move up and select Florida point guard
Jason Williams. West was disappointed early in the first round when
Sacramento took Williams with the seventh pick, ending the Lakers'
main draft-day pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell and his $7 million contract remain with the Lakers for
now, and West indicated no other changes are likely before July 1,
when the NBA is expected to impose a lockout and freeze all
business until a new labor agreement is reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to gut this team,'' West said, although
additional changes are possible. ``My best guess is this will be it
for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   In Battie, the Lakers get the No. 5 overall pick of 1997, a
promising talent who was later dubbed ``El Busto'' by
commentator-turned-Nuggets general manager Dan Issel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll take our chances,'' West said, praising Battie's
shot-blocking and underrated shooting touch. Battie averaged 8.4
points, 1.06 blocked shots and 5.4 rebounds per game as a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   Lue, rated by some as the third best point guard in the draft,
was taken by Denver with the 23rd pick, three slots before the
Lakers' first-round selection, where they might have drafted him.
</P>
<P>
   The Nebraska product, who averaged 21.2 points and 4.8 assists
as a senior, will back up Fisher, the Lakers' starter for 36 games
and throughout the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kid can really score the ball,'' West said of Lue. ``This
is a real athlete, fellas.''
</P>
<P>
   West is also pleased with first-round choice Jacobson,
Minnesota's fifth all-time scorer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a tremendously athletic kid and really the sort that
grows on you when you see him play,'' West said.

CLIPPERS GO WITH CENTER AS TOP PICK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Michael Olowokandi's entire basketball career
spans less than an average NBA season, but the way so many teams
coveted his size and vast potential, it turned out to be too hard
for the Clippers to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   After originally appearing enamored with Arizona point guard
Mike Bibby, the Clippers made the decision practically every other
team in the league endorsed: They selected the 6-foot-11 center
from Pacific as the NBA's top pick Wednesday, despite his thin
resume that included just three years of organized basketball and
77 college games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see a great risk in taking him,'' said Elgin Baylor,
the Clippers vice president of basketball operations. ``When he
came in and worked out, it was amazing the improvement that he had
shown from the end of the season to the workout. I was amazed he
did some things ... that I did not see him do in college.''
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi, who was born in Nigeria but grew up in England,
admitted he didn't think until Wednesday that the Clippers would
draft him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing my name in the No.1 spot is unbelievable, especially
when you consider where I came from three years ago _ not having
played basketball _ and then to this, not the No.3 pick but the
No.1 pick,'' Olowokandi said. ``That's something that'll take me a
week or so, or a little bit longer, to get over.''
</P>
<P>
   But once over the shock, he gave his own theory on why the
Clippers bypassed Bibby, who would have solved the need for a
starting point guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were to give my opinion, I think it would be because
Vancouver got a lot of offers from veteran teams who wanted to
trade up and get me, and (the Clippers) figured they could keep me
and get something better (at point guard) later on,'' Olowokandi
said.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor confirmed as much Wednesday night, when he said the
Clippers hoped to sign one or perhaps two free-agent point guards
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be in a free-agent market to get a point guard,'' Baylor
said. ``We would like to get more maturity on the team.''
</P>
<P>
   With no franchise players available, and little consensus about
who the top 15 players were, the draft contained several surprises.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kansas forward Paul Pierce dropped like a rock to the No.10
spot, after being projected as high as the No.2 pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little disappointing,'' Pierce said. ``That's the way
things go.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Sacramento stunned everyone by selecting Florida point guard
Jason Williams with the seventh pick. Williams was kicked off the
team at Florida and also bounced from Providence and Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   _ The biggest trade involved? Who else but one involving Dallas
coach Don Nelson. The Phoenix Suns sent guard Steve Nash to the
Mavericks in a three-way trade also involving Milwaukee. The Bucks
got the sixth pick, Robert Traylor, from the Mavericks in exchange
for the ninth pick, Dirk Nowitzki of Germany, and the 19th pick,
Pat Garrity of Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Garrity was then shipped to the Suns along with Bubba Wells,
Martin Muursepp and Dallas' 1999 first-round pick for Nash.
</P>
<P>
   If there was any suspense, it came as teams below the Clippers
waited to see if L.A. would play it safe and draft Bibby, or take
the player with the most potential _ Olowokandi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the expectation I would go to Vancouver,'' Olowokandi
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he began to get a feeling that he would go to the
Clippers last weekend, when they worked him out for a second time.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a pretty good indication that they were leaning
toward me,'' Olowokandi said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers denied Wednesday that they worked Olowokandi out
twice.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers also withstood pressure from agent David Falk to
select Bibby. Falk, who also represents Michael Jordan, met with
owner Donald Sterling on Tuesday to try to convince the Clippers to
draft his client.
</P>
<P>
   According to a source, Falk had also tried to force the Clippers
last week to publically announce that Bibby would be the No.1
choice.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, the first thought was Bibby,'' Baylor said.
</P>
<P>
   That all changed, however, when Baylor watched Olowokandi work
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the great centers in the league are getting older,''
Baylor said. ``And he is going to be one of the top centers in this
league.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor was also impressed the way Olowokandi scored on
psychological tests.
</P>
<P>
   That should come as no surprise, since he was an exceptional
student at Brunel University in England and Pacific, where he
majored in mechanical engineering.
</P>
<P>
   ``More people (in England) think you have a better chance of
winning the lottery than going to the NBA,'' Olowokandi said.
``This came in a pretty good time in my life and I've reached a
time where I need to be challenged a little bit more.''
</P>
<P>
   Where this leaves the Clippers' free-agent center, Isaac Austin,
remains to be seen. Baylor did not rule out re-signing Austin, but
the chances of that happening appear remote.
</P>
<P>
   With the 22nd pick, the Clippers selected Brian Skinner, a
6-foot-9 forward from Baylor, who averaged 18.1 poits and 9.5
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner said he didn't expect to go to the Clippers, because he
did not work out for them. But Baylor said he wanted to add
toughness and might need a spare forward in case they trade one of
their established forwards this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Baylor said there is no timetable for hiring a head coach.
He did say he has spoken to several candidates. Lakers assistant
coach Kurt Rambis remains a candidate.

CLIPPERS GETTING SERIOUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In pre-draft interviews, Nigerian-born center
Michael Olowokandi chuckled every time someone mentioned the
Clippers. We took it as incontrovertible proof that the Kandi Man
is a quick learner; only three years of serious schooling in
basketball and already he seemed to understand the NBA's
long-standing joke.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers picked first in Wednesday's stock NBA draft
because, well, somebody had to, and they threw conservatism to the
wind by selecting Olowokandi, whose name is longer than his
basketball resume.
</P>
<P>
   By eschewing the consensus safe choice _ Arizona's 20-year-old
point guard Mike Bibby _ the Clippers showed they're serious about
shedding their image as the league's laughingstock. It was a bold
move inasmuch as the 6-foot-11 player is largely unproven, the
totality of his experience consisting of three seasons and 77 games
at the University of Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers are banking on him eventually becoming as polished
on the court as he is off it. The son of a Nigerian diplomat
stationed in London, Olowokandi has a far-flung perspective and a
genial personality. He'll be an able ambassador for a Clippers team
that long has been as amorphous as Olowokandi's
Nigerian-British-Californian accent.
</P>
<P>
   Long-suffering fans of the Clippers could be forgiven for not
trusting their ears when Olowokandi, speaking from draft
headquarters in Vancouver, B.C., said he was ``tickled to death''
that things worked out the way they did.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years ago, the team's top pick, Danny Ferry, reacted as
though he had been sentenced to death, fleeing to Europe and
playing for a year in Italy rather than setting sail with the
Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   The franchise's draft history is one in which even the sturdiest
of scenarios have managed to spring leaks. In 1988, the last time
the Clippers owned the No.1 pick, they did the smart thing and
selected forward Danny Manning. He held out and then tore an
anterior cruciate ligament that abruptly cut short his rookie year.
He eventually would beg to be traded, an all-too-familiar story
line in Clipperville.
</P>
<P>
   No matter, said Olowokandi. ``What's happened in the past is
past,'' he said, sounding like someone who's ready to embrace the
franchise with the full force of his 7-foot-6 wingspan.
</P>
<P>
   Now if he can only warm free-agent-to-be forward Ike Austin on
the idea of staying, the Clippers will be blessed with one of the
better frontcourts in the league. Even without Austin it'll be one
of the deepest, with forwards Maurice Taylor, Lorenzen Wright,
Rodney Rogers and Lamond Murray slated to return.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers' backcourt remains in flux. The good news is, with
plenty of money under the salary cap they're free to cast their
line into free-agent waters. Goodness knows it's easier to hook a
solid point guard than a sterling center.
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi, 23, was the Big Kahuna of the Big West conference
this past season, blocking 95 shots in 33 games while averaging
22.2 points and 11.2 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   There may have been collegians with more sparkling credentials,
but no one had a more scintillating story than Olowokandi, a long
jumper and triple jumper of national renown in England who decided
to make the leap into basketball three years ago after seeing
``White Men Can't Jump'' in a London movie theater.
</P>
<P>
   A college student in mechanical engineering at the time,
Olowokandi extended his studies to include Basketball 101. He
obtained a copy of Michael Jordan's ``Come Fly With Me'' video and
a copy of Peterson's Guide to American Colleges.
</P>
<P>
   UOP was the first school that jumped out at him from the pages
of the college guide and after a quick transatlantic call to Tigers
assistant coach Tony Marcopulos, he came, he learned, he conquered.
</P>
<P>
   There was quite a bit he had to be taught. Like the rules, for
example. The first time Olowokandi saw a double team, he presumed
it was illegal. It took him a while to discern when he was allowed
only one free throw as opposed to two.
</P>
<P>
   But Olowokandi has a lot on the ball. In addition to the
economics degree he earned in three years from Brunel University in
Middlesex, England, Olowokandi is 12 credits shy of a mechanical
engineering degree at UOP.
</P>
<P>
   In a year where four prospective draft picks barely stayed in
school long enough to collect their high-school diplomas,
Olowokandi's academic history spoke loudly to the player's maturity
and makeup.
</P>
<P>
   Mechanical engineering is on the back burner now as Olowokandi
turns his attention to history. He's making it, not studying it.
</P>
<P>
   Back in his adopted homeland of England, where Olowokandi lived
from the ages of 3 to 20, a World-Cup weary citizenry surely will
turn its sad eyes to him. Alluding to England's disheartening 2-1
loss Monday to Romania in soccer, Olowokandi said, ``They'll
probably need some good news right now. I think people will be
amazed about my being the highest European player picked. It's a
huge compliment.''
</P>
<P>
   Being picked first overall came as a huge surprise to
Olowokandi, who was convinced the Clippers were keen on Bibby.
That's why he laughed off comments about the Clippers in the days
before the draft.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't being crass, as it turned out, just clueless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't understand why (reporters) kept beating on that
issue,'' Olowokandi said. ``I thought I was headed to Vancouver (at
No.2) so I thought the whole (line of questioning) was funny.''
</P>
<P>
   With Olowokandi aboard, the Clippers may enjoy the last laugh
yet. &QL;

TOUGH DAY FOR UCLA PLAYERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They arrived at UCLA four years ago as the most
heralded basketball recruiting class in the country. Their
departures were not nearly so memorable.
</P>
<P>
   A week that began with omm'A Givens quitting the Pepperdine team
ended ignominiously Wednesday night when his former UCLA
classmates, J.R. Henderson, Toby Bailey and Kris Johnson, were not
picked in the first round of the NBA Draft.
</P>
<P>
   Jelani McCoy, a junior who left UCLA in February after
reportedly failing multiple drug tests, was the highest Bruin
selected _ going to Seattle with the fourth pick of the second
round (33rd overall).
</P>
<P>
   Bailey, a 6-foot-5 guard, went to the Lakers with the 45th pick
and was promptly traded to Phoenix for future considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, a 6-9 forward, was in danger of not being drafted
until Vancouver rescued him with the 56th pick _ third from the
end.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a 6-3 forward, was not selected and may play in Europe
if he cannot find an NBA employer.
</P>
<P>
   It was a disappointing evening all around for the UCLA players,
one that accentuated their careerlong flaws and inability to
correct them. The same passivity that hampered Henderson, the same
inconsistent shooting that plagued Bailey, the same athletic
shortcomings that shadowed Johnson and the same poor judgment that
unraveled McCoy _ all returned to haunt them on the most important
night of their careers.
</P>
<P>
   McCoy is a 6-9 power forward with superb athletic ability. If
not for his off-court woes and raw offensive skills, he surely
would have been a first-round pick. Unwisely, McCoy spent much of
the spring trying to convince NBA scouts he could play small
forward _ hoisting shots from 15 feet instead of developing a
low-post game.
</P>
<P>
   (McCoy's agent, Arn Tellem, is used to representing troubled
athletes. Latrell Sprewell and Albert Belle are two of his
clients.)
</P>
<P>
   But Seattle seems an ideal spot for McCoy, who interviewed twice
with the Sonics. They have an aging frontline _ forwards Detlef
Schrempf and Sam Perkins are closer to 40 than 30 _ and they are
desperate for young legs to play alongside All-Star center Vin
Baker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turns out it could be a blessing in disguise,'' McCoy said.
``They let me know they were interested. The question was what pick
they'd use, their first-rounder or early in the second round. But
it makes no difference to me if I was the 66th pick, as long as I
have my foot in the door. It's a good chance to play on a
contender.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey learned of his trade moments after being selected by the
Lakers. Whether it's L.A. or Phoenix, however, Bailey must prove he
can make open jumpers _ something he failed to do at the pre-draft
camp in Chicago. His performance there was so poor, in fact,
several teams canceled interviews.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, he'll have a chance to play next to his old friend
and rival, Jason Kidd.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Suns coach Danny) Ainge called twice and said he wanted Toby
but they didn't have any draft picks,'' said Bailey's father, John.
``Ainge said he liked Toby's intensity and aggressiveness. He said
he's liked him for years. This worked perfectly. It would have been
great to be a lottery pick, but if you're going in the second round
it's great to go to someone who wants you.''
</P>
<P>
   That was also the theme in Bakersfield, where Henderson watched
anxiously as his stock plummeted. He has the offensive skills
Bailey and McCoy lack, but NBA teams considered him too soft for a
first-round selection. He is finesse incarnate _ a trait scouts saw
in abundance at the Chicago camp, and one that does not fare well
in the NBA low post.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have mixed feelings,'' said Henderson's father, Milt.
``It's a little disappointing he went so late, but we're happy it's
Vancouver, because they really wanted him.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson could not be reached for comment.

CLAIRE DISPLAYS NO BITTERNESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Fred Claire took the high road Wednesday
afternoon, a road that no longer leads to Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after his firing as the club's executive vice
president and general manager Claire, displayed no bitterness
during a news conference at a Pasadena hotel not far from downtown
L.A.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't rip Peter O'Malley, Rupert Murdoch or even Gene from
Redondo, who used to blast Claire on every talk show from Lancaster
to San Diego. The Daily News has learned Gene was not really Tom
Lasorda.
</P>
<P>
   Claire explained his role in the Mike Piazza and Hideo Nomo
deals and the drawn-out nontrade for Randy Johnson. He acknowledged
his mistakes (Pedro Martinez, Eric Davis) and said he even should
have gotten fired after the club's last-place finish in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But what is the legacy of Claire the former sportswriter, who
was O'Malley's first hire in 1969 and his first choice for GM after
Al Campanis self destructed on national television in 1987?
</P>
<P>
   ``I will let others decide that,'' he said, squinting into a
bright sun that was not nearly as hot a last Sunday's meeting at
Dodger Stadium when Claire and manager Bill Russell were canned.
</P>
<P>
   His resume simply reads: Signed Kirk Gibson, GM for 1988 World
Series; signed Darryl Strawberry; hasn't won a postseason game in
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that Fred Claire played a much bigger role in the
shaping of baseball. He was the bridge between where baseball was
and where it is going.
</P>
<P>
   In a way he was the perfect Fox soldier. Sometimes he looked
closer at a player's on-base percentage than his heart.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he was wrong thinking Antonio Osuna would be his closer
for the next 10 years. Actually there is no maybe there.
</P>
<P>
   But he brought Gibson here for that brief shining moment and
there was integrity to his decisions. Years later, Gibson
remembered the day after his Dodgers days turned sour and he
demanded a trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The little guy almost came over the desk at me,'' Gibson said.
``It was scary. He had a lot fire and I respect that. There were a
lot more there than a lot of people ever got to see. I loved Tommy,
but nobody cared more about the Dodgers than Fred.''
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Eric Karros agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this game, I never have met anyone who was more of a
straight shooter than Fred Claire. Those people are rare in this
game. He built a confidence in you by telling you the truth. I
asked him last year if I was going to be traded when all that talk
was going around. He told me no, and I'm still here.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the same Karros who was left unprotected last November
during the expansion draft. Karros said he never asked Claire about
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I already knew the answer, so there was no need. I didn't like
it, but I understood. He thought it was best for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Claire, the prototype for the job was Campanis, the old
scout molded by Branch Rickey. Campanis was brilliant and even
wrote a book, ``The Dodger Way to Play Baseball.'' Claire has a
good-sized ego but never had the gall to pull off something like
that.
</P>
<P>
   Claire went on the fact-finding scouting missions to the
Caribbean that were more like something out of the Rat Pack. But
Claire did more than sample the seafood.
</P>
<P>
   He learned as much about the fans as he did the players. In
1978, when the Dodgers went over three million in attendance for
the first time, everyone credited Lasorda, who led the Dodgers to
their second consecutive pennant. But it was Claire, the club's
director of marketing, who turned the players into people. When
Steve Garvey was introduced to the crowd during Wednesday's game,
he received an ovation rarely heard around here. And he hasn't
played here in more than 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   When they talk about visionaries, they talk about Walter
O'Malley. But Peter's father was terrified of what television would
do to the game and the precious gate receipts. In the old days the
Dodgers televised only the nine road games in San Francisco. Today,
the new owners at Fox have the cable rights to 22 of the 29 other
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Claire set the tone. He thought big.
</P>
<P>
   Claire probably never was going to get the blessing of Gene from
Redondo. He wasn't an old ballplayer, didn't treat the day-to-day
operation like a Rotisserie League draft. His sense of humor rarely
came off in interviews.
</P>
<P>
   But for the last 11 years, the Dodgers were in good hands. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ While laying nervously in a Denver hospital bed,
Bobby Bonilla started thinking about the precious time he was
missing on the baseball field.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't Chavez Ravine and the Dodgers' struggles he was
yearning for. It was the much smaller confines of a little league
stadium in Connecticut where he wished he could watch his
4-year-old son Brandon hit a baseball of a tee instead of wondering
if he had cancer.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday morning, the Dodgers' third baseman exhaled after
learning that his colon cancer test was negative. And that
afternoon, the 35-year-old reflected on the event that he
acknowledged was the scariest occurrence of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I wasn't thinking about baseball. Let me tell you that
much,'' said a relieved Bonilla, who is married and also has a
9-year-old daughter. ``I was thinking about how I hadn't seen my
son play tee-ball.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did it put (my life) in perspective?'' he said. ``It was an
eye-opening experience. All I can think about was how fortunate I
have been throughout my career, my two little ones at home and how
I hadn't seen my family since spring training.'
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night while the Dodgers were playing the host Colorado
Rockies, Bonilla was hospitalized due to intestinal problems. Tests
later revealed a colon polyp growth in his large intestine and an
infection surrounding his colon. After having a biopsy to remove
the polyp Sunday, Bonilla waited until Wednesday for results on
whether the growth was malignant.
</P>
<P>
   They were negative. But the Greenwich, Conn., resident is
receiving antibiotics to aid his large intestine inflammation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need additional surgery and that is what I'm doing
jumping jacks about,'' said Bonilla, who was put on the 15-day
disabled list Saturday. ``I was on pins and needles. I wasn't doing
too well.'
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla hasn't felt well since being dealt from Florida in a
blockbuster seven-player trade on May 15. After playing in the
first game during a road trip in Seattle, he spent the next two
days in the hotel with the flu. He has batted just .173 with one
home run in 27 games with the Dodgers, but doesn't know if his
illnesses hurt his play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been trying for him,' said Dodgers physician Mickey
Mellman, who said Bonilla is expected to come off the DL on time.
``He had been ill and it was appropriate to put him on the DL. We
expect him to recover.''

BELTRE IS SIGHT FOR SORE EYES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARC J. SPEARS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After enduring a week of sadness and turmoil, the
sight of Adrian Beltre coaxed a smile from Dodgers vice-president
Ralph Avila.
</P>
<P>
   Since his arrival from a business trip in Taiwan on Monday
night, the Dodgers' overseer of operations in the Dominican
Republic has dealt with the passing of ex-Dodgers general manager
Al Campanis, the firings of general manager Fred Claire and manager
Bill Russell and the Dodgers not living up to their tradition on
the field.
</P>
<P>
   Those thoughts, however, were temporarily forgotten when he saw
the 20-year-old Beltre wearing No.29 and taking infield practice
before Wednesday night's game at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Avila and scout Pablo Peguero signed Beltre to the Dodgers in
1994. And on this night, Avila's foresight paid off as he saw who
is arguably baseball's top prospect make his major league debut
after being promoted from Double-A San Antonio in a surprise move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've signed a few good ones, but he is one of the best,'' said
Avila, who has been instrumental in signing many Dominicans,
including Raul Mondesi and Ramon Martinez. ``He and Mondy (at
Beltre's age) were pretty close tools-wise and baseball-wise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the pressure that we have, at least we have Adrian
here. That is a good feeling,'' Avila said.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre got an RBI single in his first major-league at-bat
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   How good is Beltre? Check the third baseman's resume:
</P>
<P>
   After batting .317 with 26 home runs and 25 stolen bases last
season, he was named the Class-A Player of the Year by Baseball
America and the Florida State League Most Valuable Player.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the season, he was ranked as the third-best prospect by
Baseball America, behind Oakland's Ben Grieve and the Dodgers' Paul
Konerko, and was a spot ahead of the Chicago Cubs' Kerry Wood.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-11 player has impressive power and hitting ability,
probably the strongest arm in the organization next to Mondesi and
above-average speed.
</P>
<P>
   What's just as remarkable, the son a former St. Louis Cardinals
minor leaguer doesn't lack confidence or seem in awe of being in
the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel ready to play, mentally and physically,'' said Beltre,
who was batting .409 with 15 RBI in his last 11 games with San
Antonio. ``The jump (from Double-A) can be tough, but I don't think
that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very excited. I thought that they would call me up (in
September), but not this soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Beltre, who is the first Dodger to make the jump from Double-A
since Gary Ingram in 1994, became the 40th player this season to
wear a Dodgers' uniform. How long he will continue to wear it this
season is up to him, according to Dodgers manager Glenn Hoffman.
Even when third baseman Bobby Bonilla returns from the disabled
list, Beltre might still be a Dodger if he is producing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything is possible,'' Hoffman said. ``We just have to take
it one day a time.'
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield reminisces: Dodgers right fielder Gary Sheffield can
relate with Beltre. Sheffield was drafted sixth overall in the 1986
Amateur Draft and voted the best hitting prospect and the most
dangerous hitter in the California League a year later. At 18, he
made his major league debut with the Milwaukee Brewers and batted
.238 with four home runs in 24 games.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Beltre's promotion from Double-A Sheffield
said, ``Everything depends on how developed he is. If he is a true
star, it doesn't matter.'
</P>
<P>
   Etc: Hoffman hasn't given a timetable on when his staff will be
officially named and didn't rule out making changes.... Joe Vavra
replaces Hoffman as the organization's Minor League Field
Coordinator. Vavra previously served as the Dodgers' Assistant
Minor League Field Coordinator and organizational baserunning
coach.... Only 15 players from the Dodgers' Opening Day Roster
remain on the 25-man roster.

GOLFER'S OBSESSION ENDS IN HAWAII
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nobby Orens will go to great lengths to play golf.
Frequent-flier kinds of lengths.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday he chased the sun across North America, a journey
of 5,013 miles that started in Queens, N.Y., and ended in Honolulu
to answer the question: Can a golfer play 18 holes in New York and
18 holes in Hawaii on the same day?
</P>
<P>
   Orens, an Encino resident, is here to tell you that he can.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great, really awesome,'' he said earlier this week
after recovering from jet lag.
</P>
<P>
   Orens' three-day odyssey covered about 10,000 air miles, 36
holes and 178 strokes from the white tees. Another question comes
immediately to mind: Why rack up all those frequent-flier miles on
such a short trip?
</P>
<P>
   Turns out Orens, who has been playing for five years and is a
member of Braemar Country Club in Tarzana, is obsessed with golf.
He is a member in excellent standing of the ``Golf Nuts Society of
America,'' which is headquartered in Phoenix. Members do goofy
stuff like this all the time and earn points in the process.
</P>
<P>
   At year's end the member whose antics warrant the most points
ends up with.... the most points.
</P>
<P>
   That's it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a leaderboard that's on their Web site and so far my
points enable me to say that I'm in 10th place in the country. It's
strictly an ego thing for golf fanatics,'' said Orens, a 16
handicapper.
</P>
<P>
   This is not his most extreme behavior since taking up the game.
Orens, 61, played 128 holes in one day and he's bagged a
granddaughter's birthday and an anniversary to play golf.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the moving-day bailout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I went to play in a tournament back East and we were
moving because of the (Northridge) earthquake. I left the moving to
my wife,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out his wife Carol is one understanding woman. After 37
years of marriage, she's gotten used to her husband's whims.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's obsessed,'' she said, laughing. ``I put up with him
because he's a good guy. He gets these little notions in his mind
and he does it.''
</P>
<P>
   Adventures like the New York-to-Hawaii outing take careful
planning, which Orens is easily capable of since he owns Plaza
Travel in Encino, where he bills himself as the director of golf
research.
</P>
<P>
   The first problem was tee times, which were arranged in advance.
The two courses he played, Clearview Golf Course in Queens and Ko
Olina Golf Course in Honolulu, are operated by American Golf. The
company would not let him buy up all four spots, or five as is
sometimes the case, so he could race around the course by himself.
So Orens made a donation to a charity that American Golf supports,
the Jordan and Kyra Memorial Fund, named after two Bay Area
children who lost a fight with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   He flew into JFK International Airport on Wednesday and was on
the first tee at Clearview at dawn on Thursday. Mother nature, who
could have scotched the whole deal, cooperated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather was nice. There were thundershowers the night
before, but when I played it was fine,'' Orens said.
</P>
<P>
   The course provided him with a caddie, who helped track his
shots so time would not be wasted looking for lost balls, and Orens
completed the 18 holes in about 90 minutes, shooting an 84.
</P>
<P>
   Then he rushed back to JFK and caught a 9:15 flight to Los
Angeles, where he had a two-hour layover. He finally landed in
Honolulu at 4:40 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   That's rush hour _ but Orens had a plan. He chartered a
helicopter for a 15-minute flight from the airport to Ko Olina's
10th tee.
</P>
<P>
   He tackled the back nine first and had the course to himself
when he reached the first tee. He finished the round in an hour and
40 minutes, shooting an 94.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently somewhere over the Pacific his game took a vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I attribute that to the length of time on the plane and maybe
one or two too many bloody marys,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he did not come home empty-handed. Oren brought his wife a
souvenir of his outing, a gold bracelet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says `I love you more than.... golf,''' Carol Orens said.
``And it's on my wrist right now.''
</P>
<P>
   What's next? Golf around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   On July 23 he will travel to Alaska to play in the Idigolf
Tournament, in which the contestants play for 24 hours straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically a 100-hole tournament. But the record is 250
holes in one day. I'm going to try and beat it,'' he said. &QL;

DiSARCINA MISSES DH 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ One Angels player who hates to see the DH
eliminated as the Angels play in National League ballparks through
the weekend is shortstop Gary DiSarcina.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina went into Wednesday's game hitting .316 batting ninth
in the order, and apparently a lot of it has to do with the fact
that leadoff hitter Darin Erstad follows DiSarcina.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina said that the American League pitchers see Erstad
standing in the on-deck circle and throw him ``cookies'' to hit.
But in the NL ballparks, DiSarcina bats eighth. And with the
pitcher hitting behind him, DiSarcina doesn't get nearly as many
good pitches to hit.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina's theory seemed without merit, though, in his first
at-bat Wednesday in the third inning. DiSarcina hit a ``cookie''
thrown by Dodgers pitcher Darren Dreifort into the left-field
pavilion for a home run.
</P>
<P>
   Protest: Angels coaches Rod Carew, Larry Bowa and Mick Billmeyer
emerged from the visiting clubhouse at Dodger Stadium Wednesday
afternoon for batting practice with index cards stuck on their
caps. On the cards was the message: ``Will throw BP (batting
practice) for food.''
</P>
<P>
   The sign referred to the coaches' mock displeasure that because
of a clerical error, players and coaches did not receive the daily
meal money they normally receive when on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Back in NL: Angels manager Terry Collins, a former NL manager
with the Houston Astros, likes the chance to manage in the NL
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun for me, I like it,'' Collins said. ``You don't ever
sit back, you always have to be aware of what's going on. And it's
where your bench coach really, really has an impact.
</P>
<P>
   Greene update: Catcher Todd Greene will see Dr. James Andrews in
Birmingham, Ala., today to get another opinion on his ailing right
shoulder. Greene is still trying to determine whether or not he
should have season-ending surgery. If he doesn't have surgery,
he'll be limited to DH and first base.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Allen Watson (elbow) will leave for Vancouver today so
that he can throw his third rehab assignment game on Friday. The
Angels would like Watson to reach 90 pitches. If everything goes
OK, Watson could be activated to pitch July 1 vs. his former team,
the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Salmon, who had a cortisone shot in his left foot Monday
night, was unavailable for Wednesday's game. However, he is
expected to be ready for pinch-hitting duties tonight.

KARIYA BACK ON HIS FEET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Little, if anything, has gone right for the Mighty
Ducks in the past year. So, when Paul Kariya says he's feeling
great, it has to be music to their ears.
</P>
<P>
   Kariya, who missed 32 games because of a long contract dispute
and played in only 22 games before suffering a season-ending
concussion on Feb. 1, is working out daily and expects to be 100
percent for the upcoming season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, I couldn't remember the last time I felt good. Now, I
can't remember the last time I felt bad,'' Kariya said this week.
``Time has flown by since I've gotten better.''
</P>
<P>
   Kariya, who admitted he was concerned about his hockey future
when the post-concussion headaches and dizziness lingered for more
than two months, said a month of acupuncture treatments that he
started a day after the regular season ended helped him turn the
corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like the cloud really lifted and, from that point
forward, everything has been very positive,'' Kariya said of the
treatments recommended by Philadelphia Flyers star Eric Lindros.
``I was pessimistic. I didn't think poking needles in me would
really help. (But) it has been around for thousands of years and,
obviously, it must work.''
</P>
<P>
   Kariya said he feels so good now that he really doesn't want to
talk about the down days of February, March and April.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to be in the situation now, where I'm looking ahead,
not looking back,'' said Kariya who hasn't seen the Ducks team
doctor (Craig Milhouse) in more than a month but will pay a return
visit to neurologist James Kelly in Chicago before the season
begins.
</P>
<P>
   Kariya, who scored 17 goals and 31 points in his 22 games last
season, said he will do his best not to worry about being hit once
the 1998-99 season begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I've got to shut it out,'' he said. ``It will be
tough initially because everybody will be asking about it. But,
hopefully, after five to 10 games, it's totally forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in his career, Kariya will wear a mouthpiece.
But he said he didn't want to become ``a target'' by wearing a new
helmet.

STARGAZERS DISCOVER HUGE PLANET 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARL T. HALL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A planet bigger than Jupiter has been found
circling one of the closest stars to the sun, astronomers have
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The planet was the first to be found orbiting a small star
called Gliese 876, one-third the size of the sun and located just
15 light-years from Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The star is the closest to Earth _ other than our own sun _
around which a planet has ever been found. It is one of the closest
members of a class of low-mass stars that are the most common in
the Milky Way galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said Wednesday that the discovery of a planet around
Gliese 876 dramatically raises the odds that many more planets may
be found relatively close to our own solar system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key issue is that this is by far the lowest-mass star
around which a planet has ever been discovered,'' said San
Francisco State University astronomer Geoffrey Marcy.
</P>
<P>
   Marcy, leader of a team of researchers, first announced the
discovery at a scientific symposium in Canada earlier this week.
Within hours, the finding was confirmed by a separate team in
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   A report on the discovery will be published in Saturday's issue
of Science News.
</P>
<P>
   Marcy's team found the planet through observations with the Keck
I telescope in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   The planet's huge mass _ at least 1.9 times bigger than
Jupiter's _ was detected by a wobble in the motion of the star, not
by direct visualization.
</P>
<P>
   The new planet most likely consists of little more than a ball
of gas, mostly hydrogen and helium, scientists said. Its surface
temperature is estimated to be about 110 degrees below freezing.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen planets have been found outside the solar system so far,
all through the telltale wobbles caused by gravitational pull.
Marcy and his colleagues are credited with seven of the extrasolar
discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence of any solid land on the planet on which
earthlike life forms might have developed.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers have only begun to methodically check what might
be orbiting some 400 stars ranked the closest _ in astronomical
terms _ to our own sun, a project Marcy called ``an exciting
reconnaissance of the galactic neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not spitting distance, exactly, but spacecraft distance
perhaps for future generations,'' he said.

 Phillies beat Red Sox, 11-8  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By Gordon Edes  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ To paraphrase a certain funny fat man whose girth
and mirth eclipsed Mo Vaughn and Rich Garces in both categories ...
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, the Red Sox would rather be anywhere than in the
company of the nine from Philadelphia, W.C. Fields's favorite town.
</P>
<P>
   Losers of two straight to the Phillies in Fenway Park, the Red
Sox took the Logan shuttle here and absorbed another flogging
Wednesday night on the National Leaguers' home artificial turf,
11-8.
</P>
<P>
   Until encountering the Phillies, the Red Sox had not dropped two
straight since losing back-to-back games to another NL team, the
Mets, June 5-6 in Fenway. Despite scoring eight runs for the second
time in three nights, the Sox have lost three in a row for the
first time since they dropped six straight to the Yankees and Blue
Jays, a streak that Thursday night's starter, Bret Saberhagen,
ended by beating the Yankees May 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about momentum and confidence,'' said center fielder
Darren Lewis. ``They come back and now they go into the next day
feeling good. They feel relaxed. In our situation, now we've got to
bounce back as quickly as possible, get back to playing good
fundamental baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   No sign of that last night in Veterans Stadium. The Sons of Jimy
Williams suffered through a seven-run third inning, which matched
the largest output by the opposition in any inning this season,
then fell behind, 10-1, before an out was recorded in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Lefthander Steve Avery had his shortest outing of the season,
lasting just 2 1/3 innings, then was followed to the mound by John
Wasdin, who spotted the Phillies another four runs in the next
three innings. That was too much for the Red Sox to overcome, even
though they stacked nine hits and seven runs between the sixth and
eighth innings after Nomar Garciaparra put them on the board with
his 11th home run, a 434-foot monster to left-center, in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I backed myself into a corner, then couldn't make the pitches
I wanted to,'' said Avery. ``I didn't like my changeup very much. I
wasn't fooling anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Avery might have spared himself some damage when, with two runs
already in and two Phillies on base in the third, he made a leaping
grab of Kevin Jordan's comebacker. But because the runners were on
the move, Avery's throw to second was late.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the runners go like that, they sometimes go a little easy
into second base, and even if you don't get the runner there, you
still have time for the runner at first,'' Avery said. ``I just
didn't make a very good throw because I was a little off balance.
Bad move on my part.''
</P>
<P>
   The next batter, Mike Lieberthal, shot another ground ball over
the mound that Avery just missed, the ball continuing into center
field for a two-run single that made it 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   When Mark Lewis tripled high off the right-field wall, it was
6-0 and Avery was finished. The Phils, however, weren't. Kevin
Sefcik greeted Wasdin with an RBI single to make it 7-0, and
Philadelphia scored three more in the fourth with an outburst that
began when Doug Glanville's shallow fly to right fell among three
Red Sox: Lewis, right fielder Darren Bragg, and second baseman Mike
Benjamin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see it,'' said Lewis, who earlier had overthrown
late-arriving cutoff man Vaughn on Gregg Jefferies's two-run single
in the third, ``and Braggie didn't see it. Benji could see it, but
when I came running in yelling, `I can't see it, I can't see it,'
it scared him off.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra had two hits to extend his hitting streak to 16
games, matching his longest of the season, but even his night came
with an asterisk, as Phillies third baseman Scott Rolen robbed him
of extra bases with a diving stop of his smash down the third base
line in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Lewis, a paragon of consistency all season, was
involved in another scene born of confusion. Garciaparra managed to
salvage an infield hit on Rolen's play.
</P>
<P>
   The next batter, Vaughn, lifted a fly to center. Third base
coach Wendell Kim held up a stop sign to Wasdin, among the slowest
of all Sox players, but he headed for home. When Lewis, who was on
second, saw Wasdin going, he headed for third, hoping to draw the
throw and spare Wasdin. Wasdin did score, but Lewis was easily cut
down.
</P>
<P>
   The late Red Sox rallies succeeded in stretching out the muggy
night, but nothing more. Thanks to John Harrington, a big proponent
of interleague play, there's a rematch at the Vet tonight. Keep
this in mind: The Sox haven't won a game against the Phillies here
since 1915.

HOUSE, SENATE PANELS EARMARK PRESIDIO FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   By LOUIS FREEDBERG  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Presidio will receive between $40 million and
$50 million if legislation approved by key committees in both the
House and the Senate Wednesday becomes law.
</P>
<P>
   The House Appropriations Committee approved $25 million for
operating and maintaining the park, as well granting the Presidio
Trust to borrow up to $25 million to rehabilitate and prepare
facilities for leasing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This funding recognizes the Presidio as a national treasure in
the coming year, and brings it one step closer to
self-sufficiency,'' said Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., a member of
the committee.
</P>
<P>
   A slightly different bill was approved by a Senate
appropriations subcommittee, providing $40 million for operating
the park.
</P>
<P>
   According to Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., the legislation is
part of a longer term plan for the Presidio to become
self-supporting within 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maintaining the beauty and integrity of the Presidio has long
been one of my highest priorities,'' said Boxer. ``This funding
will help the people of the Bay Area accomplish this goal and enjoy
this national treasure for generations to come.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill also calls for $2 million to assist in the
acquisition of Bair Island, which is part of the Don Edwards
National Wildlife Refuge in the South Bay. The island, recently
purchased by the the Peninsula Open Space Trust, is thought to be
the largest unprotected wetland in the San Francisco Bay. The bill
also calls for $5.6 million for construction projects in the Golden
Gate National Recreation Area. &QL;

 Excitement lacking in draft  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By Bob Ryan  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I wish I could get excited.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Pierce? Hey, I like Paul Pierce. Why did he slip to 10?
'Cause it's still a judgment, that's why. Teams ahead of the Boston
Celtics all wanted somebody else. There is no so-called right
answer. There are wrong answers, as we all know, but there is no
right answer.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Pierce was there when the Celtics picked, and Rick Pitino
was up there beaming. ``Last year we got a little unlucky,'' he
told the FleetCenter crowd Wednesday night. ``This year we got
lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   On paper, it sounds great. Paul Pierce is a pure small forward
who averaged 20 points a game for one of the premier college
basketball programs of them all. He was a great high school player
and he was a great player at Kansas, and if Rick Pitino is as lucky
as thinks he is, he could become a very good NBA player. If he's
what he appears to be, the Celtics have three brilliant young
mid-sized talents under the age of 23 in Antoine Walker, Ron
Mercer, and Paul Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   (This is where I could get into the whole Walker business, but
let's table that for at least 24 hours, OK?)
</P>
<P>
   Great. I hope it all works out. But it's gotten to the point
where the NBA draft has become one of the most depressing nights of
the year on my sporting calendar.
</P>
<P>
   What we had last evening was another example of the beast
devouring its young. We have seen the steady deterioration of play
in this league, and the decline will continue with the addition of
more immature, incomplete, and almost certainly misguided players
to the mix. Listening to the comments of Hubie Brown, John
Thompson, and Rick Majerus on TNT Wednesday night, you'd think that
every one of the first 10 players selected was on his way to sure
stardom. Uh-uh. Isn't gonna happen.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the first 10 players selected in the 1998 draft were
underclassmen. The only four-year player chosen was Raef LaFrentz,
who went at No. 3 to Denver. First pick Michael Olokowandi, a
departure from the new norm since he is a mature 23 years old, came
to these shores from England three years ago. He played three years
of American college basketball, but he is a legitimate academic
senior.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone else came out early, or, in the case of German Dirk
Nowitzki, didn't play here at all. We already know what to expect
when he decides to play here (he might choose to wait for a year or
two, although Pitino said he would have been ``available to the
Boston Celtics'' had that situation materialized). Doc Rivers
explained Nowitzki on TV Wednesday night. He is a European, which
means he would have been utterly clueless on defense.
</P>
<P>
   These kids are really amazing sometimes. TNT's Craig Sager asked
Robert ``Tractor'' Traylor why he was in the best shape of his life
now after spending three years at 300-plus pounds at Michigan. The
kid said something about there being only 30 games a year in
college. Huh? It's OK to be fat for your college coach, but you'd
better get in shape for your pro career just because they play 82
games? I don't think that's the answer Oscar Robertson, Jerry West,
John Havlicek, or Joe Dumars would have given, do you?
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento made Pierce possible for Boston by taking a 6-1 point
guard from Florida named Jason Williams. Sacramento needed a point
guard badly. How badly? The Kings needed one badly enough to take a
kid who was originally signed by Providence, then went to Marshall
for one year before transferring to Florida, where he was kicked
off the team after 20 games during his one and only season as a
Gator for violating ``team and athletic policy.'' Sounds like a
very coachable kid. What he needs is for some coach to give him an
hourly spanking. What he'll now receive as the seventh pick in the
draft is a guaranteed contract for approximately $1.5 million
annually over the next three years. What a country.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Hughes was the eighth pick. He spent one year at St.
Louis, where he averaged 20 points while shooting 41 percent from
the floor. He is a nice talent, but is he ready in any way for the
NBA? Probably not. But he's the eighth pick.
</P>
<P>
   And what, by the way, does it say about the quality of the big
men available that the No. 1 pick in the entire draft is a young
man from Nigeria who wasn't even playing basketball four years ago?
Perhaps Michael Olokowandi is the next Hakeem Olajuwon. Perhaps
he's the next Dikembe Mutombo. But there is no guarantee he won't
be the next Yinka Dare.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Pitino loves the idea of Paul Pierce, and that's fine. But
he also loved the idea of Chauncey Billups last year. Maybe there
was a reason Paul Pierce dropped. I just know I'd feel better about
Paul Pierce, Mike Bibby, Antawn Jamison, Vince Carter, and Robert
Traylor if they had gone through four years of college so they
could enter the NBA as better men.
</P>
<P>
   The battle has been lost. With each passing year, the NBA draft
disgorges more and more incomplete players. You see the results. No
NBA person can look me in the eye and say it's as entertaining and
satisfying a league as it was 10 or 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sorry. I used to love the draft. Now I hate it.

UNBOWED UNABOMBER PITCHES BOOK IDEA TO PUBLISHER 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL TAYLOR  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Far from disappearing silently into the
anonymous maw of a federal prison, confessed Unabomber Theodore
Kaczynski is busy pitching a New York publisher and writing a
Chicago documentary producer about his plans for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Kaczynski says he wants to ``cross swords'' with government
prosecutors and FBI agents in an effort to clear his name. It is
doubtful, however, that he will ever get a chance to do so because
as far as everyone else in the case is concerned _ prosecutors,
defense attorneys and the judge _ the Unabomber case is over.
</P>
<P>
   But Kaczynski is still trying.
</P>
<P>
   Simon and Schuster, the big New York publishing house, said it
got a four-page proposal from Kaczynski, in which the 56-year-old
former mathematics professor said he wanted to write a book ``about
how he was portrayed and how he was misrepresented.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think the world wants Theodore Kaczynski's point of
view on Theodore Kaczynski? I kind of doubt it,'' Simon and
Schuster executive Bob Bender said.
</P>
<P>
   The firm sent a form letter rejecting Kaczynski's proposal to
his Florence, Colo., prison cell.
</P>
<P>
   Last January, Kaczynski pleaded guilty to killing three men and
injuring two others in a bombing campaign that terrorized the
nation between 1978 and 1995. On May 4, U.S. District Judge Garland
Burrell Jr. sentenced Kaczynski to four life terms in prison
without the possibility of release.
</P>
<P>
   Burrell also said Kaczynski could not profit from his crimes
through publishing books, giving interviews or anything else that
could earn him money.
</P>
<P>
   Besieged by reporters ever since he was arrested April 3, 1996,
at his remote cabin in Lincoln, Mont., Kaczynski has, for the most
part, refused to respond to media requests for interviews, let
alone grant any.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, however, Towers Productions received a letter from
Kaczynski this week turning down their request for an interview
with the serial bomber. Towers is co-producing a one-hour
documentary on the case.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Chronicle,
Kaczynski said it ``would be disadvantageous'' to give an interview
now because ``I am still a long way from completing the analysis of
documents that will enable me to cross swords with the prosecutors,
the FBI, the shrinks, and certain others who have misrepresented
me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to finish the work at some time within the next several
months,'' he wrote, ``and I will then be able to back up my points
with solid evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meanwhile, the public would do well to reserve judgment about
me and about the UNABOM case,'' Kaczynski wrote.
</P>
<P>
   That last thought is almost exactly what he said when the judge
gave him an opportunity to speak during his sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   As for the possibility that Kaczynski could reopen his case,
federal prosecutors have said the time for that is long past since
he agreed to an ``unconditional plea,'' which means he gave up his
right to appeal any aspect of his arrest or pretrial litigation.

 Celtics draft Pierce 
(For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By Michael Holley  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nature of the NBA draft is such that in the last month, the
Celtics worked out several players all over the United States and,
in one case, Italy. But they never thought about interviewing the
player they wound up drafting. It's not that they didn't like him.
They just thought he was too good for them.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the Celtics could see, their math wasn't working. They
knew they held the 10th pick in Wednesday night's draft and that
Paul Pierce was supposed to go in the top seven. That would leave
the Celtics three draft slots away from being able to get the
University of Kansas forward. Or so you would think. So why did the
Celtics leave the second draft of the Rick Pitino Era smiling about
the acquisition of a 6-foot-7-inch forward who grew up rooting for
the Lakers?
</P>
<P>
   That's a question that could not be answered by Pierce, Pitino,
or most Celtic fans Wednesday night. All the Celtics know is that
they entered the night thinking about Keon Clark and Dirk Nowitzki.
Instead, they came away with a 20-year-old forward who averaged 20
points per game for Roy Williams's Jayhawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you, I'm in shock right now,'' Pitino said
after Pierce had become a Celtic. ``I didn't expect this.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Pierce, he thought he wouldn't get by the Warriors, who
picked fifth. But ``after that Golden State pick, I was wondering,
`Where can I end up?''' he said. ``I was sort of holding my breath
after each pick. I really didn't have a clue coming into the draft
whether I'd be drafted in the top five or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Lester Conner, the Celtics' newest assistant coach, had raved
about Pierce to Pitino. He told the coach he and Magic Johnson _
who works out with Pierce in Los Angeles _ always said Pierce would
be an All-Star. They said Michael Olowokandi, who was taken first
by the Clippers, would be a fine pro. But Pierce wouldn't be far
behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just changed the subject and didn't follow any of that
up,'' Pitino said. ``We didn't think we had a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   But they got their shot, and once again, they should thank a
team formerly known as the Southwest Celtics (the Dallas Mavericks)
and the Sacramento Kings. It was the Mavericks who allowed the
Celtics to draft Antoine Walker and Ron Mercer in 1996 and '97. In
'98, the Mavericks took Robert Traylor with the sixth pick, which
led to the Kings shocking everyone and taking Florida point guard
Jason Williams, who wasn't projected in the top 10. That upset the
order of the draft and began the buzz: Could the Celtics get
Pierce?
</P>
<P>
   First they had to get by the 76ers, who took Larry Hughes. Next,
Pitino got word that the Bucks would take Nowitzki, whom the
Celtics worked out in Italy. That left the Celtics with a chance to
take Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a little unlucky last year,'' Pitino told a group of
cheering fans at the FleetCenter. He was referring to the '97
lottery, an event that led to the Celtics getting the No. 3 overall
pick (Chauncey Billups) while the Spurs finished first and took
draft prize Tim Duncan. ``We got lucky this year. We will take,
from the University of Kansas, Paul Pierce ...''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd erupted as the NBA wondered why Pierce slipped so low.
Some suggested that he did not arrive at all his workouts in the
best shape. He worked out for the Clippers, Warriors, Raptors,
Grizzlies, and Nuggets. Any of them could have used the 220-pound
forward from Inglewood, Calif., who sharpens his game daily by
working out with Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   But no one was talking about wind sprints and ``suicides''
Wednesday night. Most were imagining a starting five which includes
Pierce, Antoine Walker, Kenny Anderson, and Ron Mercer. ``We've got
four pieces to the puzzle in place,'' Pitino said. ``I'll tell you,
this young man will have all the ingredients. I don't have to get
him on my program. Roy Williams already has him on it. So we're
extremely lucky as far as that's concerned. We're getting somebody
who is going to be well schooled in all phases of our style.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino was asked if he truly had his lineup set since there has
been speculation that Walker will be traded because of his contract
demands. The coach said Walker was never mentioned in trade talks.
He also said there was no truth to the rumor that the Celtics had a
chance to trade Travis Knight straight up for the Lakers' Nick Van
Exel.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Pitino said, all anyone has to worry about is Pierce in
Boston. And that's what Pierce, a lifelong Lakers fan, has on his
mind, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a system where I can go in right away and play
well,'' Pierce said on a conference call from Vancouver, British
Columbia, site of the draft. He added that what concerns him most
about the NBA is ``the long season and a lot of frustrating
moments.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino left the building saying he would sleep with a smile on
his face. That's assuming he got any sleep. And if he did sleep and
happened to dream, perhaps he had visions of the kind people in
Sacramento.

DODGERS WIN, THEN FIRE THREE COACHES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Fox caught the Goose. And then some.
</P>
<P>
   Just moments after Wednesday night's 6-5, 11-inning win over the
Angels in front of 46,822 at Dodger Stadium, new Dodgers general
manager Tom Lasorda started his purge of the staff by firing three
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda began with first-year pitching coach Goose Gregson who
will be replaced by former Dodgers knuckleballer Charlie Hough.
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Hatcher, hero of the Dodgers 1988 World Series
championship, will replace Reggie Smith as the Dodgers hitting
instructor. John Shelby, another member of that World Series team,
takes over as bullpen coach, replacing Mark Cresse.
</P>
<P>
   Third base coach Joe Amalfitano keeps his job and first base
coach Mike Scioscia becomes the bench coach for Glenn Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   The new coaches are all members of the Dodgers minor league
organization. The four fired coaches have been offered positions in
the farm system. Gregson can become pitching coach at Triple-A
Albuquerque and Smith has been offered the batting coach job with
the Dukes.
</P>
<P>
   Cresse, who has been with the Dodgers since 1974, was offered
the manager's job at Class-A San Bernardino.
</P>
<P>
   If the moves weren't enough, the Dodgers took the field wearing
their blue batting practice jerseys, the first time in club history
they did not wear their white tops for a home game.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield and Raul Mondesi had home runs for the Dodgers
off left-hander Chuck Finley and Cecil Fielder and Gary DiSarcina
went deep for the Angels against right-hander Darren Dreifort.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Adrian Beltre, the Dodgers top prospect, singled
home a run in his first major league at-bat. Jim Edmonds crashed
into the center-field wall to take extra bases away from Eric
Karros in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers trailed 1-0 in the second inning when Fielder drove
a 1-2 fastball into the lower left-field stands.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre, batting .321 with 13 homers and 56 RBI at Double-A San
Antonio, came to the plate in the second inning with runners at
first and second. He drilled Finley's first pitch into left field,
scoring Paul Konerko and tying the score.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels took the lead in the third when DiSarcina homered to
center, his first of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But Finley, who had dropped two straight after winning three in
a row, did not settle down. Eric Young opened with a single and
stole his league-leading 30th base.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Castro walked and Sheffield drove a Finley fastball into
the right-field pavilion to give the Dodgers a 4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   They made it 5-2 in the fifth when Mondesi homered with two
outs. It was his team-leading 17th of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But just like the first two games in Anaheim, the Dodgers were
unable to hold their lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels got two back in sixth, the first on a wild pitch by
Dreifort that scored Dave Hollins. The second came home on a
sacrifice fly by catcher Matt Walbeck.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman came to the mound in the sixth, but wasn't ready to make
a move. But after Fielder opened the seventh with his third hit,
the Dodgers went to left-hander Scott Radinsky, who has been
demoted from closer to set-up man.
</P>
<P>
   Garret Anderson sacrificed pinch runner Damon Mashore to second
and Walbeck singled him home to tie the score at five. Greg
McMichael replaced Radinsky and retired the next two batters to get
out of the inning.

<P>
   Just moments after Wednesday night's 11-inning 6-5 win over the
Angels in front of 46,822 at Dodger Stadium, new general manager
Tom Lasorda started his purge of the Dodgers coaching staff by
reassigning pitching coach Goose Gregson, hitting instructor Reggie
Smith and bullpen coach Mark Cresse.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the beginning of the Glenn Hoffman era,'' bellowed
Lasorda, who said the Dodgers' new manager was responsible for the
changes. ``This was his first major-league victory and there are
many more to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregson will be replaced by former Dodgers knuckleballer Charlie
Hough. Gregson, who replaced Dave Wallace before the season, will
take Hough's job at Class-A San Bernardino.
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Hatcher, hero of the Dodgers' 1988 World Series
championship, will replace Smith as the Dodgers' hitting
instructor. Smith has been offered the manager's spot at Triple-A
Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be a positive change and a way to manage in the
majors someday,'' Smith said. ``But it's something I'll talk over
with my wife before I decide.''
</P>
<P>
   John Shelby, another member of that World Series team, takes
over as bullpen coach, replacing Cresse.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman coach Joe Amalfitano keeps his job and first base
coach Mike Scioscia becomes the bench coach for Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things can't be done at the end of the season, they have
to be done now,'' Hoffman said. ``There is not enough time to wait
to see if things turn around.''
</P>
<P>
   Cresse, who has been with the Dodgers since 1974, was offered
the manager's job at San Bernardino three years ago. He is close to
Lasorda, who is godfather to his son Brad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll go home and think about it,'' he said. ``I kind of always
thought I'd be here forever.''
</P>
<P>
   If the moves weren't enough, the Dodgers took the field wearing
their blue batting-practice jerseys, the first time in club history
they did not wear their white tops for a home game.
</P>
<P>
   The coaching changes and new jerseys overshadowed the game, the
first Dodgers victory since last Friday and first over the
first-place Angels in three interleague games this season..
</P>
<P>
   Trenidad Hubbard, who returned from a rehab assignment Monday,
drove in the winning run when he singled home Matt Luke against
left-hander Greg Caderet (1-1). Antonio Osuna (4-0), the fourth
Dodgers pitcher, threw two scoreless innings to pick up he victory.
</P>
<P>
   Long before the game was decided, Gary Sheffield and Raul
Mondesi had home runs for the Dodgers off left-hander Chuck Finley,
and Cecil Fielder and Gary DiSarcina went deep for the Angels
against right-hander Darren Dreifort.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Adrian Beltre, the Dodgers' top prospect, singled
home a run in his first major-league at-bat. Jim Edmonds crashed
into the center-field wall to take extra bases away from Eric
Karros in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre, batting .321 with 13 homers and 56 RBI at Double-A San
Antonio, came to the plate in the second inning with runners at
first and second. He drilled Finley's first pitch into left field,
scoring Paul Konerko and tying the score.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels took the lead in the third when DiSarcina homered to
dead center, his first of the season. But Finley, who had dropped
two straight after winning three in a row, did not settle down.
Eric Young opened with a single and stole his league-leading 30th
base. Juan Castro walked and Sheffield drove a Finley fastball into
the right-field pavilion to give the Dodgers a 4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   They made it 5-2 in the fifth when Mondesi homered with two
outs. It was his team-leading 17th of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels got two back in sixth, the first on a wild pitch by
Dreifort that scored Dave Hollins. The second came home on a
sacrifice fly by catcher Matt Walbeck.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman came to the mound in the sixth but wasn't ready to make
a move. But after Fielder opened the seventh with his third hit,
the Dodgers went to left-hander Scott Radinsky, who has been
demoted from closer to setup man.
</P>
<P>
   Garret Anderson sacrificed pinch runner Damon Mashore to second
and Walbeck single him home to tie the score at five. Greg
McMichael replaced Radinsky and retired the next two batters to get
out of the inning.

 Thank Kings for Pierce  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By Peter May  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Send your thank you notes to Geoff Petrie in Sacramento. If
you're as excited about Paul Pierce as Rick Pitino is, then you've
got Petrie, the Kings' basketball boss, to thank. He made it all
happen.
</P>
<P>
   He did it by surprising one and all and taking point guard Jason
Williams from Florida with the seventh pick Wednesday night in the
NBA draft. That not only cleared the way for Pierce to fall to No.
10 _ we'll only mention Michael Young, Sam Vincent, and Acie Earl
once _ but it typified a wacky first round.
</P>
<P>
   Petrie took a novel approach to the draft: He made the selection
based on need. He needed backcourt help in the worst way, having
lost Mitch Richmond via trade and Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf via defection
(Turkey), and had no one reliable to run the show. Williams was on
everyone's list as the second-best point guard, after Mike Bibby.
He might have been seen as a legit top seven pick had he not been a
total boothead at Florida. (He should have fun with Chris Webber.)
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' choice meant Pierce, still unaccountably available,
was destined for Boston. The 76ers are committed to Tim Thomas at
small forward and needed a shooting guard. Hello, Larry Hughes. And
Milwaukee already had a prearranged deal with Dallas to draft the
player Boston really wanted _ German Dirk Nowitzki _ which meant
Pierce would be available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sacramento was the key for us,'' Celtics general manager Chris
Wallace said.
</P>
<P>
   Thus concluded a wacky top 10. It would get even wackier as the
night went on. Nazr Mohammed, a player the Celtics said they were
considering at No. 10, went 29th to the Jazz, who didn't want to
pick anyone and moved him to Philadelphia for a future first-round
choice. The Celtics, according to Wallace, ``chased a lot of big
guys through the teens and 20s,'' offering a first-round pick. No
one accommodated them.
</P>
<P>
   It was, of course, destined to be a wacky night because the
Clippers were in control and there was no stand-alone No. 1. For
the first time since Pervis Ellison went first overall in 1989,
there was last-minute confusion, discussion, and debate over which
way Los Angeles would turn: big or little.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers couldn't lose either way _ we think. They went big,
with raw but promising Michael Olowokandi, a 7-foot-1-inch athlete
who may or may not be one of the better centers in the league by
the millennium. In so doing, they dissed David Falk, who had
determined that his guy, Bibby, was going to the Clippers and had
had an 11th-hour repast with Los Angeles owner Donald Sterling to
make a final pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby ended up going second, also a mild surprise. It was at
this spot that many had slotted Pierce, if only because Vancouver
had drafted a point guard last year. Would Stu Jackson, the
Grizzlies' general manager, pick another point guard knowing that
he was admitting to one and all that he botched Antonio Daniels?
(We all knew that, anyway.)
</P>
<P>
   Dallas, with Trader Don Nelson at the helm, was all over the
map, starting with Nowitzki and ending with the acquisition of
Steve Nash. With the sixth pick, the Mavericks took Robert Traylor,
which was an eye-opener. They needed backcourt help. But the
Traylor pick was for Milwaukee; the Bucks had agreed to send picks
9 and 19 to Dallas for No. 6.
</P>
<P>
   That enabled them to snatch Nowitzki right out of Pitino's
hands. The Celtics had zeroed in on the German, despite public
expressions of doubt regarding his availability and foreign players
in general. (Hey, Pitino admitted they were lying.) It would have
been interesting to see which way Boston would have gone had both
Pierce and Nowitzki been available; the guess here is that the
Celtics would have taken the German.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics think he has a chance to be a great one. Boston
already had practically leased a Lufthansa widebody to send an
entourage to Germany to begin the courtship, selling the NBA (it
would be restricted as to what it could offer him) and the Celtics
and the tradition and Red Auerbach and the parquet floor and the
Big Dig. Pitino said he was confident Nowitzki would have played
for Boston this season _ the coach is an optimist, but he seemed
sure about this and had worked him out in Rome _ while most reports
had Nowitzki committed to a team in Italy for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Nellie also got Pat Garrity with his second pick, then wrangled
Nash from Phoenix for the Mavs' unprotected No. 1 next season.
Dallas threw in Garrity and a couple players to balance the
contract, but the Mavericks, with Nash and, perhaps, Nowitzki
available next season, suddenly look passable.
</P>
<P>
   Nellie also had the Warriors convinced that he was interested in
Antawn Jamison and was ready to pounce on the North Carolina star
at No. 4. That led Golden State to work a deal with Toronto,
flip-flopping picks. Golden State got its man _ Jamison _ while
Toronto got its man _ Vince Carter _ along with what Sidney
Greenstreet would call ``carrying charges.''
</P>
<P>
   Several projected first-rounders slid even further than Pierce,
including Mohammed. Rashard Lewis, the Houston high schooler who
many felt would go to the Rockets at 14, 16, or 17, instead went in
the second round. High schooler Al Harrington went 25th to Indiana.
The Bulls took Corey Benjamin, who had been mentioned as a top 20
pick in some mock drafts.

 Revolution blasted, 5-3  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By Jim Greenidge  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Hoping to reverse their fortunes, the
New England Revolution switched from a 4-4-2 to a 3-5-2 alignment
last night against the New York-New Jersey MetroStars.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a Plan B?
</P>
<P>
   Finding no problem solving this new look, the MetroStars rang up
14 shots on net and set a team record for goals as they dealt the
Revolution their seventh straight Major League Soccer setback, 5-3,
before a crowd of 10,310 at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It was particularly deflating for the Revolution, who erased a
3-1 deficit, then surrendered the winning goal to rookie Mark Petka
of Southern Connecticut State in the 69th minute _ only 30 seconds
after Raul Diaz Arce's second goal of the game had tied things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I had a bull's-eye on my chest,'' said Revolution
goalkeeper Ian Feuer. ``It's not an individual thing. It's all of
us. Enough is enough. We had a lot of breakdowns, all 11 players.
Things could have gone better. Even I could have played better.
We're not a team right now. Until we work for each other and cover
up for each other's mistakes ... but we still have the talent to do
something.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution (4-10) climbed within a goal when midfielder
Edwin Gorter belted in a shot from just outside the box along the
right side to the far side in the 64th minute. Then Diaz Arce
converted a setup pass from Gorter, heading it from outside the
6-yard box along the left.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we tied it, I thought we were going to win,'' said
Gorter. ``Every time the MetroStars took shots, though, they scored
goals by having it hit a hand, changing the shot. Maybe it was
concentration for us. Maybe it was intensity. I'm not sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it was, Petka, a Rookie of the Year candidate, ripped
in the winner from the top of the box, over Feuer's head, for his
first goal. ``That goal took the wind out of their sails,'' said
MetroStars coach Alfonso Mondelo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We broke down, and with veterans, that can't happen,'' said
Revolution head coach Thomas Rongen, who took leave of his
assistant duties with the US World Cup team in France to fly in for
this match. ``That happens too often. We broke down our
concentration with (Johnny) Torres and (Janusz) Michallik. We fell
asleep. We have to coach the players the whole period.''
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars tried to beat the Revolution to the outside.
``With three men deep, we had a lot of room to the outside to try
to exploit them,'' Mondelo said. ``It was a far different look to
play against us than the last time when they gave us a different
look at 4-4-2.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's the deal with the Revolution's defense? ``We didn't
adjust to our game plan; we didn't stay with their runners,'' said
defender David Nakhid. ``Some players weren't picking up their
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Now two losses shy of the league record for futility they set
last season, the Revolution will have reinforcements for Saturday's
game against the Dallas Burn at Foxboro Stadium. Defender Mike
Burns and forward Joe-Max Moore will be back from the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like we have to go at it again,'' Nakhid said. ``It's
the nature of the beast. We have to somehow find the result and
stay positive and come back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One encouraging thing is that we haven't lost faith, and any
time you get to six and seven straight, you can lose faith,''
Rongen said. ``We've got to do this together. This is especially
tough when you're down, 3-1, and you tie it up, 3-3, so you're
always hopeful.''

 &HT;    CLINTON GETS POMP AND COLOR AT FIRST CHINA STOP BEFORE FACING
TOUGH ISSUES
 &HT;    With CHINA-ODDITIES-$ADV25; CHINA-HISTBOX-$ADV25.
 &HT;    By MARCIA KUNSTEL and JOSEPH ALBRIGHT 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   XIAN, China _ Thousands of Chinese were gathering in the shadow
of this 600-year-old city's walls Thursday evening (China time) to
give a vivid imperial-era welcome to U.S. President Bill Clinton
and his family, opening what promises to be the most controversial
foreign visit of this presidency.
</P>
<P>
   An extravaganza of music, dance and martial arts, patterned
after elaborate Tang Dynasty ceremonies, was awaiting a crowd of
several thousand guests invited to come and greet the Clintons upon
their arrival to the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
   In the hot and hazy summer night, Clinton was expected to walk
to the city's towering South Gate down a red carpet the length of
two football fields. It was lined with 32 hanging red lanterns --
red is for luck in China -- adding their glow to the strings of
tiny white lights that outline much of the seven-mile long walls,
their gates and towers.
</P>
<P>
   Horse guards and Chinese dressed as warriors also were part of
the ceremony, the kind of production that Tang Dynasty emperors
used to mount back in 600-900 A.D. for foreign guests come to pay
homage at Xian, a metropolis that was bigger and grander than any
Western capital.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Clintons arrived to enjoy the outpouring of
hospitality that thousands of Chinese here have worked for months
to prepare, the region's leaders got a taste Friday of the
contentious issues Clinton will be trailing along in the wake of
his entourage.
</P>
<P>
   ``For as long as 1,100 years Xian was China's political economic
and cultural center,'' Mayor Feng Xuchu proudly announced at a
reception for foreign journalists, an event clearly intended to be
a pleasant social respite.
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor and provincial governor both were quickly thronged
after their welcoming remarks and peppered with the kind of
questions that journalists for the government-controlled media
would not dare to ask.
</P>
<P>
   What about reports that local dissident Yan Jun had been
arrested, an uncomfortable Mayor Feng was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know this person. I don't even know the name. I deny
it,'' Feng said. Then he added that if anyone was arrested, it was
because he violated the law.
</P>
<P>
   Yan, a dissident in Xian who took part in a letter signed by 70
people asking Clinton to meet dissidents, was taken away from his
home Wednesday afternoon, the Information Center of Human Rights
and Democratic Movement in China said.
</P>
<P>
   Yan's whereabouts were unknown Thursday, shortly before
Clinton's planned arrival in the north China city, the Hong
Kong-based group added.
</P>
<P>
   Also detained Wednesday was Li Zhiying, a county official in
Chengcheng, about 80 miles northeast of Xi'an, who was in frequent
contact with other Xi'an dissidents and had previously signed
petitions to the government, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   Letters and petitions are among the few recourses for Chinese
who take issue with government policy. Even former Communist Party
leader Zhao Ziyang, under house arrest since the June 3-4, 1989,
crackdown on democracy protests centered on Tiananmen Square, has
resorted to penning his grievances.
</P>
<P>
   It was a taste of the difficult questions both the American
delegation and its Chinese hosts will be facing for the nine days
of the Clinton visit, which is the longest presidential foray to a
single nation in nearly eight decades.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Chinese and American sides have characterized this
visit as an important turning point in relations, a chance to usher
into the 21st Century a cooperative liaison that will be vital in
shaping the world of the future.
</P>
<P>
   Yet leaders on both sides have also tried to downplay any
potential controversies. Thus, it is startling that so little about
the final outcome of the summit is pre-determined. It is uncertain
whether any major agreements will be reached, on either trade or
arms controls.
</P>
<P>
   And the Chinese well may take umbrage if Clinton fulfills his
promise to the American public to speak out about human rights
violations and religious oppression.
</P>
<P>
   The American team managed to schedule at least the first night
and following day of Clinton's visit to avoid as much controversy
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's 24-mile journey from the Xian airport to city center
is a motorcade through history, an education for any first-time
visitor to China.
</P>
<P>
   The route passes flowering persimmon trees, orchards of
pomegranates and fields where winter wheat was lately harvested.
Peasants normally are still at work at dusk, the time the motorcade
was scheduled, threshing stacks of wheat by hand or tending their
fruit trees or vegetable plots with primitive farm equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Bumping up from stretches of flat farmland are twin high mounds
of dirt holding tombs of the Han Dynasty that ruled China from 206
B.C. to 220 A.D. Across the four-lane road stands a symbol of a
more modern China, a coal-fired thermal power plant that billows
clouds of white smoke as plants and industries do across China,
making it one of the world's most polluted countries.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Clinton will take the tourist road out to the resting
place of more than 7,000 ancient terra cotta warriors, horses and
chariots, the 2,000-year-old wonder unearthed little more than 20
years ago. Then he will talk to leaders of a local village before
heading on to Beijing on Friday night.

   Western thought about sex has been tainted by the notion that
the female is a kind of imperfect or unfinished male. But science
is demonstrating that women can do some things better, that they
have many biological and cognitive advantages over men _ and vice
versa. In fact, just about every aspect of our physiology diverges
</P>
<P>
   _ how we metabolize alcohol and drugs, the way our circulatory

   With the recent introduction of Viagra, the impotence pill made
by Pfizer, the world has changed. Suddenly there is a pill for men
who have trouble getting and maintaining erections. Almost as
suddenly, drug-company scientists, wondering whether Viagra or
something like it can enhance sex for women, are asking academic
scientists what is known about women's sexual responses. The answer
is not much, writes Gina Kolata, who reports on science and
medicine for The New York Times.

   The number of liposuction operations increased 215 percent to
149,042 from 47,212 between 1992 and 1997, according to the latest
statistics from the American Academy of Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgeons in Arlington Heights, Ill. Plastic surgeons performed
32,607 breast augmentations in 1992; five years later, they did
122,285. As the numbers show, cosmetic surgery is soaring thanks to
baby boomers who are looking longer in the mirror and seeing sags
and wrinkles. But what are the hazards? Susan Gilbert, who writes
regularly about health for the Science Times section of The New

   It took Carla and Bruce P. three and a half gut-wrenching years
of invasive medical treatments and more than $40,000 of their

Task Force on Life and the Law recognizes as the ``disease'' of
infertility. The odds can be long when it comes to infertility
treatment, reports free-lance journalist Anne Adams Lang. And the

   Five years ago, a much-wanted pregnancy at age 37 prompted
medical writer Kathleen McAuliffe to seek prenatal testing. The
grainy picture on the ultrasound machine showed a glorious baby.
But the results of her amniocentesis were ominous. The fetus was
male and appeared to be normal _ except for an alteration on one
chromosome. If even a fraction of a gene had been nicked or
scrambled, the consequences could be terrible. The child might be
born deformed or retarded and suffer from multiple disabilities. In
this poignant feature, McAuliffe leads readers into the murky world
of genetics and recounts her personal plan of action.

concentrating on women, were the hottest stocks on Wall Street. But
few lived up to investors' expectations, and their high-flying

   It took Carla and Bruce P. three and a half gut-wrenching years
of invasive medical treatments and more than $40,000 of their
savings before Carla got pregnant in April. That makes them part of
a small but growing population that beat what the New York State
Task Force on Life and the Law recognizes as the ``disease'' of
infertility. The odds can be long when it comes to infertility
treatment, reports free-lance journalist Anne Adams Lang. And the
odds of having insurance cover what is needed can be even trickier.

   Five years ago, a much-wanted pregnancy at age 37 prompted
medical writer Kathleen McAuliffe to seek prenatal testing. The
grainy picture on the ultrasound machine showed a glorious baby.
But the results of her amniocentesis were ominous. The fetus was
male and appeared to be normal _ except for an alteration on one
chromosome. If even a fraction of a gene had been nicked or
scrambled, the consequences could be terrible. The child might be
born deformed or retarded and suffer from multiple disabilities. In
this poignant feature, McAuliffe leads readers into the murky world
of genetics and recounts her personal plan of action.

   With the recent introduction of Viagra, the impotence pill made
by Pfizer, the world has changed. Suddenly there is a pill for men
who have trouble getting and maintaining erections. Almost as
suddenly, drug-company scientists, wondering whether Viagra or
something like it can enhance sex for women, are asking academic
scientists what is known about women's sexual responses. The answer
is not much, writes Gina Kolata, who reports on science and
medicine for The New York Times.

   The number of liposuction operations increased 215 percent to
149,042 from 47,212 between 1992 and 1997, according to the latest
statistics from the American Academy of Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgeons in Arlington Heights, Ill. Plastic surgeons performed
32,607 breast augmentations in 1992; five years later, they did
122,285. As the numbers show, cosmetic surgery is soaring thanks to
baby boomers who are looking longer in the mirror and seeing sags
and wrinkles. But what are the hazards? Susan Gilbert, who writes
regularly about health for the Science Times section of The New

   Five years ago, a much-wanted pregnancy at age 37 prompted
medical writer Kathleen McAuliffe to seek prenatal testing. The
grainy picture on the ultrasound machine showed a glorious baby.
But the results of her amniocentesis were ominous. The fetus was
male and appeared to be normal _ except for an alteration on one
chromosome. If even a fraction of a gene had been nicked or
scrambled, the consequences could be terrible. The child might be
born deformed or retarded and suffer from multiple disabilities. In
this poignant feature, McAuliffe leads readers into the murky world
of genetics and recounts her personal plan of action.

   Every day, Marcie Rothman, 51, takes three Body Wise Female
Advantage nutritional capsules _ an arsenal of 22 ingredients
marketed as the natural answer to menopause. And she's not alone.
Like many women her age, Rothman is helping to support a $4 billion
alternative-remedy industry by dosing herself with nontraditional
treatments. But how safe are they? And just how effective? Karen
Stabiner, a Los Angeles-based writer who is the author of ``To

   Bright hopes but poor performance help explain Wall Street's
ambivalence toward women's health-care companies, reports Leslie
Eaton, a financial reporter who covers Wall Street for The New York
Times. In the early 1990s, biotechnology companies, including some
concentrating on women, were the hottest stocks on Wall Street. But
few lived up to investors' expectations, and their high-flying
stocks plunged.

   With the recent introduction of Viagra, the impotence pill made
by Pfizer, the world has changed. Suddenly there is a pill for men
who have trouble getting and maintaining erections. Almost as
suddenly, drug-company scientists, wondering whether Viagra or
something like it can enhance sex for women, are asking academic
scientists what is known about women's sexual responses. The answer
is not much, writes Gina Kolata, who reports on science and
medicine for The New York Times.

   The number of liposuction operations increased 215 percent to
149,042 from 47,212 between 1992 and 1997, according to the latest
statistics from the American Academy of Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgeons in Arlington Heights, Ill. Plastic surgeons performed
32,607 breast augmentations in 1992; five years later, they did
122,285. As the numbers show, cosmetic surgery is soaring thanks to
baby boomers who are looking longer in the mirror and seeing sags
and wrinkles. But what are the hazards? Susan Gilbert, who writes
regularly about health for the Science Times section of The New
York Times, reports.

   It took Carla and Bruce P. three and a half gut-wrenching years

Task Force on Life and the Law recognizes as the ``disease'' of

treatment, reports free-lance journalist Anne Adams Lang. And the

<P>
   Western thought about sex _ from the story of Eve to Aristotle's
belief that girl babies arise from cooler sperm _ has been tainted
by the notion that the female is a kind of imperfect or unfinished
male.
</P>
<P>
   Medical science, however, has gone from treating women as though
they were simply smaller men to realizing that sex confers many
more differences than those that are related to reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the feminist premise that women can do anything
men can do, science is demonstrating that women can do some things
better, that they have many biological and cognitive advantages
over men. Then again, there are some things that women don't do as
well.
</P>
<P>
   One of the less visible, but theoretically very important
differences, is the larger size of the connector in women between
the two hemispheres of the brain. This means that women's
hemispheres are less specialized: a stroke that damages the left
side of the brain leaves men barely capable of speech, while the
same damage to a woman's brain is far less debilitating since she
can use both sides for language.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no hard evidence, the larger connector may
also account for a woman's tendency to exhibit greater intuition
(the separate brain halves are more integrated) and a man's
generally stronger right-handed throwing skills (controlled by a
left hemisphere without distractions).
</P>
<P>
   Mary Catherine Bateson, the cultural anthropologist and a former
president of Amherst College, has described women as ``peripheral
visionaries'' able to follow several trains of thought (or
children) simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Men, by contrast, seem more capable of focusing intensely on
single topics. Our strengths, then, come from our differences
rather than from our similarities.
</P>
<P>
   Science and medicine are finally realizing that the differences
that exist between men and women necessitate developing distinct
therapeutic treatments addressing the specifics of our physiology.
</P>
<P>
   For example, doctors like Dr. Susan G. Kornstein, at the Medical
College of Virginia's department of psychiatry, are advocating the
use of sex-specific assessment and treatment of psychiatric
disorders, like depression.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent paper published in the Journal of Clinical
Psychiatry, Kornstein points out that while depressed men seem to
respond best to drugs that affect two neurotransmitter systems,
those involving norepinephrine and serotonin, women respond better
to drugs that affect only the serotonin system.
</P>
<P>
   These differences in the therapeutic benefits of drugs not only
underscore the need for medicine to go beyond giving women tapered
doses of whatever is being prescribed for men (a latter-day
offshoot of the women-as-incomplete-men theory), but support the
idea that men's and women's brains do not function the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is not only our brain functions that apparently
diverge, but just about every aspect of our physiology. The way we
metabolize alcohol and drugs, the way our circulatory system works
and how resistant we are to infection are all affected by our sex.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Hormones.
</P>
<P>
   In utero, girls and boys are chromosomally different; one might
wag that the determinant of maleness, the Y chromosome, named for
its shape, is ``missing'' something that the female determinant,
the X chromosome, has. But they look identical.
</P>
<P>
   The development of characteristic male and female sexual
genitalia at birth and of secondary sexual characteristics like
breasts during adolescence, result from influxes of hormones,
including estrogen and testosterone.
</P>
<P>
   But the hormones we once thought were important only for
pregnancy, lactation and sexual drive have profound effects on just
about every organ in the body.
</P>
<P>
   For example, recent research demonstrates that while men begin
to suffer from coronary artery disease earlier in life than women
do, women are more likely to die of coronary complications once
they are afflicted. Men are also more prone throughout most of
their lives to high-blood pressure, but as women get older, this
advantage disappears.
</P>
<P>
   The delayed onset of cardiovascular disease in women may be
linked to the fact that the female hormone, estrogen, which is
produced mostly by the ovaries, protects the circulatory system
from disease.
</P>
<P>
   Differences in the quantities of estrogen, essential for
organization and maintenance of tissues and organs in both sexes,
plays an important role in brain development and appears to be the
reason that men's brains are bigger, but women's brains have more
neurons.
</P>
<P>
   Estrogen makes blood vessels more elastic, stimulates them to
expand and allow good blood flow, and prevents cholesterol
accumulation on the inside of blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   As women age, however, they lose the protective benefits of
estrogen because, in a rather dramatic fashion, their bodies stop
producing it.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some treatments that are used to prevent
cardiovascular disorders _ aspirin, for example _ are less
effective in women.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting in a recent issue of the International Journal of
Fertility and Women's Medicine, Dr. Marianne Legato, of the
Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, notes:
``Although aspirin use is associated with less frequent myocardial
infarction in both men and women, it does not decrease the risk of
stroke in hypertensive women, as it does in men.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of naturally produced compounds that
fluctuate more in women than in men: steroids, for example, which
are infamous on the street for their simultaneous role in
developing muscles and shortening tempers.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that steroids, a class of compounds that includes
sex hormones, may play an important role in the mood swings of
menstruators. These hormones directly affect brain cells.
</P>
<P>
   The neuroactive steroid allopregnanolone, made from
progesterone, dampens the sensitivity of brain cells; it works like
benzodiazepine drugs, most familiarly Valium. When the progesterone
level is high, a woman is calmer. When it is low, she may feel more
anxious and irritable. Moreover, women with PMS become insensitive
to the calming effects of Valium-like drugs.
</P>
<P>
   There is a growing consensus that these steroids produced by the
sex organs are responsible for the greater incidence of mood
disorders and depression in women. And a growing body of research
is pointing to a role for other, similar steroids in memory, stress
and alcohol abuse.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the increasing recognition that some powerful
mind-altering substances are internally produced by hormones, it is
no wonder that adolescence is often a time of emotional turbulence.
You cannot ``Just say no'' to your body's own genetically timed
release of mood-altering sex hormones at puberty.
</P>
<P>
   What society considers ``recreational'' drug use, which often
begins at adolescence, may sometimes be motivated by an effort to
self-medicate, changing or reversing the effects of sex hormones
and neuroactive steroids. The notorious mood swings of adolescents
may very likely reflect the body's adjustment to new concentrations
and combinations of these compounds.
</P>
<P>
   Lester Grinspoon, an associate professor of psychiatry at
Harvard Medical School and an advocate of the medical use of
marijuana, points out that marijuana has long been known as a
palliative for the psychophysical pains of menstruation. Queen
Victoria, according to her doctor J.R. Reynolds, used it for that
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously (and although since disputed), one of the few medical
studies on marijuana suggests that its use lowers testosterone
levels in men.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this drug, among others, interacts with or works in a
similar way to the hormonal and neuroactive steroids.
</P>
<P>
   In any case women, who are twice as prone as men to depression,
and who have a higher body-fat-to-muscle ratio and more hormonally
distinct brains, cannot be expected to respond to drugs, legal or
illegal, in the same way men do.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, humans have learned that the two sexes, subtly
different, develop differently, respond differently to certain
drugs and see the world in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   As the French say, vive la difference.

 By GINA KOLATA 
 c.1998 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Dr. Julia Heiman, a psychologist who directs the reproductive
and sexual medicine clinic at the University of Washington, wanted
to know whether women become sexually excited by talk of love and
romance, or are they turned on by explicit talk of sex itself?
</P>
<P>
   So Heiman asked college students to wear a tamponlike device
that detects blood flow to the vagina. While they wore it, the
young women listened to romantic tape recordings and to erotic
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Heiman got her answer: If blood flow to the vagina is an
accurate measure of sexual excitement, women, like men, are
sexually excited by erotic talk, not romance.
</P>
<P>
   That was in the early 1970s. Yet even now, when most fields of
medicine have been transformed, Heiman's studies are still state of
the art.
</P>
<P>
   With the recent introduction of Viagra, however, the impotence
pill made by Pfizer, the world has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly there is a pill for men who have trouble getting and
maintaining erections. Almost as suddenly, drug-company scientists,
wondering whether Viagra or something like it can enhance sex for
women, are asking academic scientists what is known about women's
sexual responses.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is not much.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most medical professionals, a woman's genitals are still
`down there,''' said Dr. John Gagnon, a sociology professor at the
State University of New York at Stony Brook. At their mention,
Gagnon added, ``Everyone averts their eyes in horror.''
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, he said, is finding out what gives women pleasure
and how to enhance their pleasure. Men worry that ``if she enjoys
it too much, will she do it with someone besides me?'' Gagnon
explained.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes the evidence that many women are unhappy with
their sex lives. Dr. Sandra R. Leiblum, a psychologist at the
Robert Wood Johnson Medical Center in New Brunswick, N.J., noted
that ``every survey invariably finds that many more women than men
complain of sexual difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiblum cited a major survey in the United States that found a
third of women respondents _ but only a sixth of men _ saying they
are uninterested in sex. One-fifth of the women _ but only
one-tenth of the men _ said sex gave them no pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Leiblum said she thinks most sexual complaints in women are
psychological. Most women can have orgasms easily by masturbating,
she said, ``when they don't feel pressured to perform, and when
they don't feel concerns about how they look or how they are formed
or how they smell.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is also much easier and more socially acceptable to study
psychological problems than the physiology of sexual responses in
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a huge resistance'' to understanding women's sexual
responses, said Dr. James H. Geer, a professor of psychology at
Louisiana State University and an inventor of the tamponlike device
that Heiman, his graduate student then, used in her studies.
</P>
<P>
   Geer and his colleagues developed that device without financing,
he said, which is typically how studies of female sexuality are
done.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of this reluctance, the simplest questions have no
answers. Half a century ago, when Dr. Alfred C. Kinsey surveyed the
sex lives of Americans, he proclaimed that men and women have
basically the same sexual responses, except that men are more
influenced by psychological factors.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Bancroft, the director of the Kinsey Institute at
Indiana University, said that scientists now know that ``Kinsey was
wrong about psychological differences.'' Yet, Bancroft added,
``Whether he was wrong about physiological similarities remains an
open question.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Viagra increases blood flow to the penis, enabling
men to have erections. By analogy, some doctors have suggested that
Viagra might also increase blood flow to the clitoris and enhance a
woman's sexual response.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Gagnon noted, the idea that women suffer from
inadequate blood flow to the clitoris has no experimental evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were women with inadequate clitoral swelling, how
would we know that?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers who want to directly measure sexual responses in
women are stymied by a lack of a good method, Heiman said.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have said that her studies, involving blood flow to
the vagina, focused on the wrong organ. Why did she avoid the
clitoris? Because no one has figured out how to study the
physiological changes in the clitoris during sexual arousal, Heiman
said. It is not easy to fit the clitoris with a measuring device.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clitoris is so sensitive that simply touching it could
trigger a response,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   Women often complain of having difficulty lubricating, so some
researchers tried to measure the secretion of vaginal fluids while
women watched erotic movies or listened to erotic tapes. The
researchers used tampons, weighing them before and after the women
were stimulated.
</P>
<P>
   But the tampons turned out to be too crude to measure the amount
of vaginal secretions. So far, no one has found a reliable way to
measure vaginal fluids secreted during arousal, and no one knows
how much fluid is enough and how much is insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer, meanwhile, is hoping to bypass the morass of ignorance
regarding women's sexual physiology and simply ask, Does Viagra
improve women's sex lives?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frances Quirk, who works for Pfizer at its research center
in Sandwich, England, said that the early studies of Viagra in men
concentrated solely on ways to measure the drug's physical effects
on erections. But the company soon redirected its efforts, Quirk
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the big breakthroughs was in understanding that patient
assessments and perceptions can yield valuable information,'' she
said. ``This is probably even more important for women.''
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing from the same method, Dr. Quirk and her colleagues
developed a questionnaire that asks women how often they have sex,
how confident they are as a sexual partner and how well and how
quickly they respond to sexual stimulation. They tested their
survey with 1,160 women living in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The results, Quirk said, appear to show a relationship between
women's symptoms of sexual dysfunction and worries about the future
of their sex lives.
</P>
<P>
   For example, 34 percent of women who said they had difficulty
becoming aroused said they worry about the future of their sex
lives, whereas just 5 percent of those who had no such difficulty
with arousal had this worry. And 13 percent of those who had
difficulty lubricating _ as compared with 8 percent who had no such
problem _ were anxious about their sex lives.
</P>
<P>
   Now, sex researchers say, the moment of truth is looming.
</P>
<P>
   It was easy to justify Viagra in men because the drug, as Pfizer
keeps emphasizing, does not increase desire. All it does is help a
man who already has the desire for sex to achieve an erection.
</P>
<P>
   But the primary complaint among women is the lack of desire. For
society to sanction research on sexual dysfunction in women, Heiman
said, ``People would have to view women's sexual desire as an
important issue.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, drug companies are not the federal
government. They can go ahead with sex research if there is a
problem that needs to be treated and a market for a drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``One could say that having a lack of information on women's
sexuality is just fine with the general culture,'' Heiman said,
``but it may not be so fine with the drug industry.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Dr. Julia Heiman, a psychologist who directs the reproductive
and sexual medicine clinic at the University of Washington, wanted
to know whether women become sexually excited by talk of love and
romance, or are they turned on by explicit talk of sex itself?
</P>
<P>
   So Heiman asked college students to wear a tamponlike device
that detects blood flow to the vagina. While they wore it, the
young women listened to romantic tape recordings and to erotic
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Heiman got her answer: If blood flow to the vagina is an
accurate measure of sexual excitement, women, like men, are
sexually excited by erotic talk, not romance.
</P>
<P>
   That was in the early 1970s. Yet even now, when most fields of
medicine have been transformed, Heiman's studies are still state of
the art.
</P>
<P>
   With the recent introduction of Viagra, however, the impotence
pill made by Pfizer, the world has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly there is a pill for men who have trouble getting and
maintaining erections. Almost as suddenly, drug-company scientists,
wondering whether Viagra or something like it can enhance sex for
women, are asking academic scientists what is known about women's
sexual responses.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is not much.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most medical professionals, a woman's genitals are still
`down there,''' said Dr. John Gagnon, a sociology professor at the
State University of New York at Stony Brook. At their mention,
Gagnon added, ``Everyone averts their eyes in horror.''
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, he said, is finding out what gives women pleasure
and how to enhance their pleasure. Men worry that ``if she enjoys
it too much, will she do it with someone besides me?'' Gagnon
explained.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes the evidence that many women are unhappy with
their sex lives. Dr. Sandra R. Leiblum, a psychologist at the
Robert Wood Johnson Medical Center in New Brunswick, N.J., noted
that ``every survey invariably finds that many more women than men
complain of sexual difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiblum cited a major survey in the United States that found a
third of women respondents _ but only a sixth of men _ saying they
are uninterested in sex. One-fifth of the women _ but only
one-tenth of the men _ said sex gave them no pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Leiblum said she thinks most sexual complaints in women are
psychological. Most women can have orgasms easily by masturbating,
she said, ``when they don't feel pressured to perform, and when
they don't feel concerns about how they look or how they are formed
or how they smell.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is also much easier and more socially acceptable to study
psychological problems than the physiology of sexual responses in
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a huge resistance'' to understanding women's sexual
responses, said Dr. James H. Geer, a professor of psychology at
Louisiana State University and an inventor of the tamponlike device
that Heiman, his graduate student then, used in her studies.
</P>
<P>
   Geer and his colleagues developed that device without financing,
he said, which is typically how studies of female sexuality are
done.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of this reluctance, the simplest questions have no
answers. Half a century ago, when Dr. Alfred C. Kinsey surveyed the
sex lives of Americans, he proclaimed that men and women have
basically the same sexual responses, except that men are more
influenced by psychological factors.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Bancroft, the director of the Kinsey Institute at
Indiana University, said that scientists now know that ``Kinsey was
wrong about psychological differences.'' Yet, Bancroft added,
``Whether he was wrong about physiological similarities remains an
open question.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Viagra increases blood flow to the penis, enabling
men to have erections. By analogy, some doctors have suggested that
Viagra might also increase blood flow to the clitoris and enhance a
woman's sexual response.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Gagnon noted, the idea that women suffer from
inadequate blood flow to the clitoris has no experimental evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were women with inadequate clitoral swelling, how
would we know that?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers who want to directly measure sexual responses in
women are stymied by a lack of a good method, Heiman said.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have said that her studies, involving blood flow to
the vagina, focused on the wrong organ. Why did she avoid the
clitoris? Because no one has figured out how to study the
physiological changes in the clitoris during sexual arousal, Heiman
said. It is not easy to fit the clitoris with a measuring device.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clitoris is so sensitive that simply touching it could
trigger a response,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   Women often complain of having difficulty lubricating, so some
researchers tried to measure the secretion of vaginal fluids while
women watched erotic movies or listened to erotic tapes. The
researchers used tampons, weighing them before and after the women
were stimulated.
</P>
<P>
   But the tampons turned out to be too crude to measure the amount
of vaginal secretions. So far, no one has found a reliable way to
measure vaginal fluids secreted during arousal, and no one knows
how much fluid is enough and how much is insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer, meanwhile, is hoping to bypass the morass of ignorance
regarding women's sexual physiology and simply ask, Does Viagra
improve women's sex lives?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frances Quirk, who works for Pfizer at its research center

<P>
   Sitting naked on tissue paper, mouth dry, heart flip-flopping,
clawing at the plastic hide of the examining table, I do not feel
as if I'm in a power position.
</P>
<P>
   It's been more than 30 minutes and the paper is adhering,
shifting with me.
</P>
<P>
   My imagination is metastasizing; the syringes, catheters and
scalpels in the cabinet all have my name on them.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a fully-dressed human being marches into the room
weary, impatient and, while reading from a folder that really does
have my name written on it, demands, ``What seems to be the
trouble?''
</P>
<P>
   If this were a true story, I would mumble, ``I'm really sorry to
bother you, doctor, but. ...'' But since this is a fantasy, I smile
confidently as I gesture at a person sitting quietly in a corner
and say: ``This is my Patients Union representative, doctor. You
don't mind if we videotape the session?''
</P>
<P>
   In 20 years of serious travel in what I call Malady, the country
of illness, as a cancer patient and as a caregiver, I have come to
be certain only of this: You must never cross the border into that
country by yourself.
</P>
<P>
   At best, your traveling companion should be a healthy spouse or
a partner with advanced degrees in accounting, diplomacy, law,
medicine and comedy. That is a fantasy even I don't entertain.
</P>
<P>
   Too often we make the journey alone, sick and scared, vulnerable
to bullying billing clerks, snide receptionists, overworked
technicians and nurses and doctors who can rarely take the time to
listen to a history that can ensure a future.
</P>
<P>
   So. Let me introduce the Patients Union.
</P>
<P>
   At its most personal level, your Patients Union local would
supply a sidekick, a seasoned traveler in Malady, to be a second
pair of eyes and ears at a doctor's appointment and at a meeting
with your health insurance company or with the hospital's financial
department.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the national organization would be giving ulcers to
government agencies, HMOs and drug companies that aren't acting in
your best interest.
</P>
<P>
   When I say all this, and until now it has mostly been said at
parties after the medicinal red wine, the doctors smile tightly or
roll their eyes or, if they understand that I am not kidding, shift
uncomfortably as if they are sitting on tissue paper.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard for them to understand that the Patients Union does
not necessarily consider doctors to be the central target of
protest and change _ they have always cherished their centrality to
medicine _ but rather another element, caught as we are in a
Titanic medical-corporate complex.
</P>
<P>
   We need to seize control of the bridge and-or the lifeboats by
banding together as boldly as the doctors, nurses, hospitals and
accountants have.
</P>
<P>
   We are the one element that even the ultimate
GE-Disney-Microsoft HMO can never completely control or contain.
</P>
<P>
   We are the one element they can never do without _ their raw
material, product, customer base, constituency. Without sick
people, they are dead.
</P>
<P>
   But sick people and their caregivers have traditionally been
balkanized not only by age, race, gender, class and money but, most
critically, by disease.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every major malady has its own laboratory and lobbyist,
national society, celebrity chairman, board of famous doctors and,
too often, financing from a drug company profiting from the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Each malady competes with other maladies for government money,
publicity and TV movies of the week.
</P>
<P>
   While the gallantry and media savvy of the AIDS bandwagon played
on, the breast-cancer forces learned and prospered. Now the
prostate boys are moving up. Look for mental illness, particularly
depression, adult schizophrenia and bipolar disorders to be coming
on strong.
</P>
<P>
   Does this make sense? Can you imagine if those diseases joined
forces, if they included the sufferers of lupus, multiple
sclerosis, Crohn's disease, diabetes, sickle-cell anemia; if they
embraced the marathon caregivers of people with Canavan's disease
and Alzheimer's; if they found room for the quads, the hep Cs, the
almost invisible heroes of Charcot-Marie-Tooth, a chronic,
incurable neuromuscular disease?
</P>
<P>
   For three weeks this spring, while appearing on call-in radio
shows and at bookstores from Miami to Seattle, I spoke with
hundreds of fellow patients and was amazed anew at how bound we are
by common concerns, regardless of sex or disease.
</P>
<P>
   We are frightened and outraged by the tyranny of current
health-insurance practices. Even when we are lucky enough to have
decent coverage, we often feel trapped in the job that offers it.
</P>
<P>
   We are frustrated by the decreasing amount of ``face time'' with
doctors, who themselves admit that the relationship between doctor
and patient is critical to getting and staying well.
</P>
<P>
   And we are bedeviled by the message of the healer-dealers that
somehow we are at fault for being sick; that it is a shame and a
punishment, and that we should be grateful for any casual mercies
the system dispenses.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I had thought of the Patients Union in Miami instead of
in Seattle, so that I could have crossed the country with a sheaf
of membership applications.
</P>
<P>
   Joining is easy, I would have said. All you need is an old
medical bill and a willingness to protest against, even picket, a
doctor who doesn't share information and options; an HMO making
cost-efficient, rather than life-saving decisions; a drug company
inflating prices; and a government official selling us out.
</P>
<P>
   In my organizing speech I would say: Our imperfect union of
imperfect people will include the measured brand-testing of the
Consumers Union and the muscular intimidation of the teamsters'
union under Jimmy Hoffa.
</P>
<P>
   While our C.U. side will distribute those best doctor-best
hospital lists that the glossy magazines love so much, our lists
will include mortality, hygiene, affability and cost charts.
</P>
<P>
   Our teamsters' side will throw the occasional chanting picket
line around an HMO that cuts services and raises prices.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, there will be union wildcats, officially disavowed,
of course, who will leave bad administrators, doctors and
politicians outside TV studios dressed only in their ``malpractice
suits'' _ naked except for a wrap of tissue paper.
</P>
<P>
   At Patients Union meetings, we will keep reminding one another
that as customers we have a right to demand service, to get
information and to be part of the decision-making process, which
ultimately includes who gets all the new drugs and procedures for
which we are paying through taxes and medical fees.
</P>
<P>
   Each meeting will include an injection of tumor humor, that
nasty, silly, self-affirming chemotherapy for the spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Patients and caregivers need permission to mock health-care
providers behind their backs (doc spelled backward is cod, after
all, not god) or to make the offensive, scatalogical-location jokes
that somehow ease the most painful of journeys.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone will get Patients Union T-shirts and bumper stickers
saying: P.U. because the system stinks!
</P>
<P>
   And no meeting can end without the fight speech: ``Nobody wants
to be a professional patient, to be identified by what has gone
wrong. But merely waiting for magic bullets or another gang take
over is just another way of giving up.''

depression, adult schizophrenia and bipolar disorders to be coming
on strong.
</P>
<P>
   Does this make sense? Can you imagine if those diseases joined
forces, if they included the sufferers of lupus, multiple
sclerosis, Crohn's disease, diabetes, sickle-cell anemia; if they
embraced the marathon caregivers of people with Canavan's disease
and Alzheimer's; if they found room for the quads, the hep Cs, the
almost invisible heroes of Charcot-Marie-Tooth, a chronic,
incurable neuromuscular disease?
</P>
<P>
   For three weeks this spring, while appearing on call-in radio
shows and at bookstores from Miami to Seattle, I spoke with
hundreds of fellow patients and was amazed anew at how bound we are
by common concerns, regardless of sex or disease.
</P>
<P>
   We are frightened and outraged by the tyranny of current
health-insurance practices. Even when we are lucky enough to have
decent coverage, we often feel trapped in the job that offers it.
</P>
<P>
   We are frustrated by the decreasing amount of ``face time'' with
doctors, who themselves admit that the relationship between doctor
and patient is critical to getting and staying well.
</P>
<P>
   And we are bedeviled by the message of the healer-dealers that
somehow we are at fault for being sick; that it is a shame and a
punishment, and that we should be grateful for any casual mercies
the system dispenses.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I had thought of the Patients Union in Miami instead of
in Seattle, so that I could have crossed the country with a sheaf
of membership applications.
</P>
<P>
   Joining is easy, I would have said. All you need is an old
medical bill and a willingness to protest against, even picket, a
doctor who doesn't share information and options; an HMO making
cost-efficient, rather than life-saving decisions; a drug company
inflating prices; and a government official selling us out.
</P>
<P>
   In my organizing speech I would say: Our imperfect union of
imperfect people will include the measured brand-testing of the
Consumers Union and the muscular intimidation of the teamsters'
union under Jimmy Hoffa.
</P>
<P>
   While our C.U. side will distribute those best doctor-best
hospital lists that the glossy magazines love so much, our lists
will include mortality, hygiene, affability and cost charts.
</P>
<P>
   Our teamsters' side will throw the occasional chanting picket
line around an HMO that cuts services and raises prices.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, there will be union wildcats, officially disavowed,
of course, who will leave bad administrators, doctors and
politicians outside TV studios dressed only in their ``malpractice
suits'' _ naked except for a wrap of tissue paper.
</P>
<P>
   At Patients Union meetings, we will keep reminding one another
that as customers we have a right to demand service, to get
information and to be part of the decision-making process, which
ultimately includes who gets all the new drugs and procedures for
which we are paying through taxes and medical fees.
</P>
<P>
   Each meeting will include an injection of tumor humor, that
nasty, silly, self-affirming chemotherapy for the spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Patients and caregivers need permission to mock health-care
providers behind their backs (doc spelled backward is cod, after
all, not god) or to make the offensive, scatalogical-location jokes
that somehow ease the most painful of journeys.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone will get Patients Union T-shirts and bumper stickers
saying: P.U. because the system stinks!
</P>
<P>
   And no meeting can end without the fight speech: ``Nobody wants
to be a professional patient, to be identified by what has gone
wrong. But merely waiting for magic bullets or another gang take
over is just another way of giving up.''
</P>

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   As a securities analyst for the brokerage firm Salomon Smith
Barney, and one of the first people on Wall Street to specialize in
companies focusing on women, Melissa Wilmoth can rattle off
demographic facts and figures that show women are becoming a vast
and powerful market for medical products.
</P>
<P>
   Wilmoth speaks excitedly about technological breakthroughs and
new devices that will improve the treatment of breast and cervical
cancers, osteoporosis, incontinence and infertility. And she can
reel off a long list of small companies that are developing these
new products.
</P>
<P>
   So of the two dozen companies in Wilmoth's area of expertise,
how many does she recommend as investments? Two, both of which have
business links to her firm.
</P>
<P>
   This situation exemplifies Wall Street's attitude toward
investing in women's health care: a lot of hope, a little hype and
a huge amount of caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to recommend stocks that aren't good
investments,'' Wilmoth said.
</P>
<P>
   The financial track record of many women's health companies is
not good, but neither is the financial performance of most small
medical firms.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, biotechnology companies, including some
concentrating on women, were the hottest stocks on Wall Street. But
few lived up to investors' expectations, and their high-flying
stocks plunged.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have been wiped out,'' said Morton A. Cohen,
who operates Clarion Partners, an investment management firm in
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Because they were burned, many long-term investors shunned
biotechnology, Cohen said. He has persevered, he added, because
``it's the industry of the 21st century, with a lot of unexploited
areas, such as women's health.''
</P>
<P>
   Some investors have been burned twice. In 1995 and 1996, about
10 companies sold stock to the public for the first time. These
were not biotechnology firms; rather, they were working on devices
for diagnosing and treating ailments that afflict women.
</P>
<P>
   But after a sizzling debut, most of the stocks sank.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Wilmoth said, was that these companies' products
``were early stage, and it may have been a little premature for
them to go public.''
</P>
<P>
   Many ran into trouble persuading the Food and Drug
Administration to approve their products, insurance companies to
cover their costs or doctors to use them at all.
</P>
<P>
   An extreme case was Imagyn Medical, which went public in May
1996 for $15 a share. Though the stock immediately rose, going as
high as $18, the company quickly ran into difficulties as customers
cut their orders of its microlaparoscopes, which are used in
gynecological examinations.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Imagyn merged with Urohealth Systems, a troubled
company that produces urological medical products. An investor who
bought Imagyn's stock at $15 now owns shares worth about $1.50
each.
</P>
<P>
   The shares have fallen mostly because the company's earnings
were not as strong as analysts had expected, said David Pyrce,
Imagyn's vice president for investor relations, adding, ``It's sort
of the kiss of death to disappoint Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Bright hopes but poor performance help explain Wall Street's
ambivalence toward women's health-care companies. Only a handful of
analysts follow the sector, up from zero just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Conferences on the subject are springing up, always a sure sign
of Wall Street's interest. On the other hand, there is no mutual
fund devoted to women's health companies despite the proliferation
of specialized funds.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia F. Widner can explain why. Widner is a co-manager of
the Warburg Pincus Health Science Fund, the top fund in the health
sector over the last year. She tracks almost 40 small, innovative
companies, many specializing in women's health and urological and
reproductive medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm intrigued,'' she said, but as of late May, she added, ``I
don't own any of them.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because they do not meet all of the fund's criteria for
companies, including having more than one product to sell and an
experienced management that can operate a new business, deal with
the FDA, reassure Wall Street and persuade insurance companies to
reimburse doctors who use their new products.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not enough to invest in good science,'' Widner said,
echoing colleagues. ``It's a good business we're looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Even professional investors most likely to take big risks _ the
early investors known as venture capitalists _ have been slow to
commit to women's health companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most venture capitalists are guys,'' explained Cynthia
Robbins-Roth, the editor of Bioventure Publishing in San Mateo,
Calif., which tracks developments in that field.
</P>
<P>
   But more venture capitalists will become interested,
Robbins-Roth said, as the big pharmaceutical companies become
corporate partners with the little companies or simply buy them.
</P>
<P>
   That is starting to happen. Biopsys, which makes equipment for
breast biopsies and went public in 1996, was bought last year by
Johnson &AMP; Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who purchased at the initial offering would have
almost doubled their money in a year, Wilmoth noted.
</P>
<P>
   Other big corporations, like Eli Lilly and American Home
Products, are also making sizable efforts in women's health care.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for mergers, acquisitions and stock underwritings
_ all lucrative businesses for Wall Street _ helps explain
analysts' growing interest in women's health companies.
</P>
<P>
   Some firms, too, are trying to improve reputations tarnished by
lawsuits contending that they discriminated against female
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Salomon Smith Barney, for example, settled such a suit earlier
this year; individual claims are now being heard by arbitrators.
</P>
<P>
   An emphasis on women's health also gives firms a chance to lure
women, who have previously been ignored by Wall Street and
represent a huge untapped market, into becoming investors. But
there may be sound financial reasons behind the advice that women
should invest in companies catering to their medical needs.
</P>
<P>
   If the demographers and financial gurus are right, women will be
spending large sums on health care in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why shouldn't you benefit from the trend you are paying
into?'' asked Widner, the mutual-fund manager.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, that may mean investing mainly in major
pharmaceutical companies such as Eli Lilly, Merck, Johnson &AMP;
Johnson and American Home Products, which is merging with Monsanto.
</P>
<P>
   Among the specialty companies, Wilmoth recommends Trex Medical,
which makes a new, high-tech mammography machine, and ESC Medical
Systems, which produces lasers for dermatology and depilatory uses.
Both have sold stock through Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Wilmoth predicted that many more companies will be profitable
enough to make them attractive investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sector is driven by demographics,'' she said. ``The
demographics equal dollars, and the dollars equal profits.''

<P>
   Are men worth it?
</P>
<P>
   More precisely, is the maxim true about marriage being good for
a man's health but hazardous for a woman's _ or is it a sly old
spinster's tale?
</P>
<P>
   Do we live better with men or without them, and which life will
be longer, and which will simply seem longer?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, like marriage itself, is a glorious mess.
Nevertheless, it can be roughly summed up as follows: Marriage is
pretty good for the goose much of the time, but golden for the
gander practically all of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marriage has a beneficial effect for both men and women, but
the effect is much stronger for men,'' said Jeffery Sobal, an
associate professor of nutritional sciences at Cornell University.
``Men may resist, they may kick and scream about getting married,
but then it does them a world of good.''
</P>
<P>
   A little background first. Researchers first noticed the
benefits of marriage to men's health and longevity in the mid-19th
century.
</P>
<P>
   For women, the epidemiological picture was less clear, but
everybody assumed that they, too, must thrive in matrimony: After
all, weren't women the ones who wanted it so badly?
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, however, Jesse Bernard wrote a highly influential book
called ``The Future of Marriage'' in which she argued that wedding
bells sounded the death knell to a woman's well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard presented data indicating that while married men scored
higher than single men on measures of mental health like
depression, severe neurotic symptoms and phobic tendencies, the
opposite applied for women.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers of the era came to similar conclusions, and to
this day the belief persists that the ranking of personal
satisfaction runs from married men at the blissful peak, followed
by single women, married women and, lastly, by single men.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the conventional portrait of marriage as chicken soup for
the man, battery acid for the woman is misleading.
</P>
<P>
   According to Linda J. Waite, a sociologist at the University of
Chicago, the early studies were too limited in how they defined
mental health.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you broaden the psychological outcomes that you look at,
you see that marriage is good for both sexes,'' Waite said. ``It
helps men on this dimension, women on that dimension, but there's
no difference in the sum total of benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, she said, marriage protects women against problem
drinking better than it does men, and it helps shield men against
depression more effectively than it does women.
</P>
<P>
   In Waite's view, a strong marriage is a nondenominational wonder
drug. She cites evidence from a recent cross-cultural survey, which
found that married people in 17 countries reported feeling
significantly happier than their unmarried peers.
</P>
<P>
   In another study, researchers analyzed 11 measures of
psychological well-being in a group of people at the beginning and
end of five years. During that time, some subjects got married,
others were widowed or divorced and still others stayed married. On
nearly all 11 variables, the still-marrieds outperformed everybody
_ except the recently married.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about being married that makes people work
better,'' Waite said. ``We're group-living animals, and we're
hard-wired to bond.''
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to say you feel chipper and self-confident. But
does the body listen? There, the data for women are murkier.
</P>
<P>
   In a report that will be published in the fall in the Journal of
Health and Social Behavior, Dr. Ingrid Waldron of the University of
Pennsylvania and her colleagues looked at a group of 3,000 young
women over 10 years. They explored the effect of marriage and
employment status on 16 measures of general physical health _
including proneness to chronic fatigue or dizziness, the distance
one can walk and the weight one can lift.
</P>
<P>
   They concluded that marriage improved the physical health of
women who were not employed outside the home. But for working
women, being married or single made no physical difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We suspect that it's a matter of social support,'' said
Waldron, a biologist. ``You can get that support from your husband,
or you can get it from being around other adults at work, but
having it is what seems to be the key.''
</P>
<P>
   For men, on the other hand, nuptials offer health benefits
independent of employment status.
</P>
<P>
   Most studies show that matrimony adds more years to a man's life
than it does to a woman's, said Joan S. Tucker, a psychologist at
Brandeis University.
</P>
<P>
   Marriage can even make frail men strong. Researchers from the
Rand Center for the Study of Aging in Santa Monica, Calif.,
recently determined that men in comparatively poor condition were
more likely than men in robust shape to get married, and at an
earlier age.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite their initial health handicap, the married men ended
up with a three- to four-year advantage in life span over their
single brethren.
</P>
<P>
   Matrimony helps men even as it thickens their waistlines. Sobal
and his colleagues at Cornell have calculated that men gain more
weight as a result of being married than women do. Yet they still
outlast the confirmed bachelors.
</P>
<P>
   Among the elderly, losing a spouse hits men harder than it does
women. Dr. Maradee A. Davis, an epidemiologist at the University of
California, San Francisco, and her co-workers recently reported
that men 70 or older experienced a 20 percent rise in their risk of
death in the year after the loss of a wife, but that older women
who lost a husband experienced a slight decrease in their risk of
dying within the year.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaping to the conclusion that wives do far too much for
their mates, though, it bears recalling that women outlive men by
about eight years, regardless of who is happily coupled and who
miserably alone.
</P>
<P>
   Men may need marriage; men very likely invented it in the first
place. But women can only offer them so much protection against an
untimely departure.

<P>
   Are men worth it?
</P>
<P>
   More precisely, is the maxim true about marriage being good for
a man's health but hazardous for a woman's _ or is it a sly old
spinster's tale?
</P>
<P>
   Do we live better with men or without them, and which life will
be longer, and which will simply seem longer?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, like marriage itself, is a glorious mess.
Nevertheless, it can be roughly summed up as follows: Marriage is
pretty good for the goose much of the time, but golden for the
gander practically all of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marriage has a beneficial effect for both men and women, but
the effect is much stronger for men,'' said Jeffery Sobal, an
associate professor of nutritional sciences at Cornell University.
``Men may resist, they may kick and scream about getting married,
but then it does them a world of good.''
</P>
<P>
   A little background first. Researchers first noticed the
benefits of marriage to men's health and longevity in the mid-19th
century.
</P>
<P>
   For women, the epidemiological picture was less clear, but
everybody assumed that they, too, must thrive in matrimony: After
all, weren't women the ones who wanted it so badly?
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, however, Jesse Bernard wrote a highly influential book
called ``The Future of Marriage'' in which she argued that wedding
bells sounded the death knell to a woman's well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard presented data indicating that while married men scored
higher than single men on measures of mental health like
depression, severe neurotic symptoms and phobic tendencies, the
opposite applied for women.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers of the era came to similar conclusions, and to
this day the belief persists that the ranking of personal
satisfaction runs from married men at the blissful peak, followed
by single women, married women and, lastly, by single men.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the conventional portrait of marriage as chicken soup for
the man, battery acid for the woman is misleading.
</P>
<P>
   According to Linda J. Waite, a sociologist at the University of
Chicago, the early studies were too limited in how they defined
mental health.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you broaden the psychological outcomes that you look at,
you see that marriage is good for both sexes,'' Waite said. ``It
helps men on this dimension, women on that dimension, but there's
no difference in the sum total of benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, she said, marriage protects women against problem
drinking better than it does men, and it helps shield men against
depression more effectively than it does women.
</P>
<P>
   In Waite's view, a strong marriage is a nondenominational wonder
drug. She cites evidence from a recent cross-cultural survey, which
found that married people in 17 countries reported feeling

<P>
   IT took Carla and Bruce P. three and a half gut-wrenching years
of invasive medical treatments and more than $40,000 of their
savings before Carla got pregnant in April. That makes them part of
a small but growing population that beat what the New York State
Task Force on Life and the Law recognizes as the ``disease'' of
infertility.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky? Indisputably.
</P>
<P>
   First because Carla, a legal assistant, and Bruce, a real-estate
broker, succeeded when the biological odds are stacked against a
41-year-old woman conceiving even with high-tech intervention.
Second because Carla's new insurance carrier, U.S. Healthcare, paid
for the successful round of blood tests, sonograms, laboratory
work, egg harvesting, in-vitro fertilization and implanting the
resulting embryos. All this was performed by one of New York City's
top reproductive medical teams, which was led by Dr. Cecilia
Schmidt-Sarosi and her husband, Dr. Peter Sarosi, reproductive
endocrinologists.
</P>
<P>
   That insurance policy saved Carla and Bruce, who do not want
their last name published, roughly $10,000 that they would have
paid themselves if they had approached the managed-care company
just one month later.
</P>
<P>
   On April 1, U.S. Healthcare, now merged with Aetna, canceled its
coverage of in-vitro fertilization and other high-tech fertility
treatments, making it available to employers only through a rider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we were one of the few programs covering IVF, women
flocked to us who could not find coverage elsewhere,'' said Jill
Griffiths, a spokeswoman for Aetna Healthcare. The policy, she
said, was simply too expensive to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We contacted them in March and when I read that the company
had stopped the policy, my heart just dropped,'' Bruce said. ``But
we lucked out. We got coverage on a shoestring, and we just got in
under the wire.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurance carriers are mostly like poltergeists haunting the
field of reproductive medicine. They materialize with ephemeral
policies that are changed or are withdrawn in a flash.
</P>
<P>
   Only recently, for example, Group Health Insurance, one of the
largest carriers in New York, announced that it is withdrawing its
coverage for all assisted reproductive technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless they operate in states with mandates to cover
infertility treatments, such as Massachusetts, Illinois and
Maryland, managed-care and indemnity insurers have ignored
fertility coverage and gotten away with it,'' said Dr. Norbert
Gleicher, who founded the Center for Human Reproduction, a
Chicago-based chain of fertility treatment centers. ``That's
imminently about to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gleicher, who recently contracted with Oxford Health Plans
to do a joint venture with Columbia University, gave three reasons
for the new interest in fertility coverage:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; VIAGRA. &LR;  The White House decision to require Medicaid coverage
of the drug that treats male sexual dysfunction, and mounting
pressure on private insurance companies to do the same, has opened
the floodgates to sexual-discrimination suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once insurance companies conclude they have to cover Viagra,
how can they not cover female infertility drugs?'' Gleicher asked.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LEGAL PRECEDENT. &LR;  A police officer sued the city of Chicago for
violating the Americans With Disabilities Act, saying infertility
is a disability.
</P>
<P>
   ``A disability is an impairment of a body system that inhibits a
major life activity,'' said Patricia Collins, the lawyer who won
the class-action suit this year. ``The only question is whether
procreation is a major life activity. My position is, if work is a
major life activity, I would hope procreation is as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Susan B. Conlon agreed and the city settled, saying it
would follow Illinois's guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ECONOMICS. &LR;  ``Smart insurance companies are recognizing that it
may be in their interest to cover, even to a limited extent,
infertility because it brings an underground economy in fertility
services above ground,'' Gleicher said.
</P>
<P>
   He explained that doctors often perform infertility treatments,
like tubal surgeries, and list them as a different, often more
costly procedure so that patients can secure coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In a study to be published in September, William M. Mercer, a
firm of human-resource consultants, concludes that the hidden costs
of infertility treatments range from 27 cents to 50 cents a month
for each member of the insurance plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending on co-pay arrangements and how well the plans are
managed, it would cost in the neighborhood of 40 cents to 50 cents
to provide coverage,'' said Lisa Astor, a consultant at Mercer.
```Our thoughts are that employers are already paying for
infertility whether they know it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a wave of consumer anger over the right to
reproduce that threatens to engulf lawmakers in several states,
including New York.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman David S. Sidikman has introduced a bill that would
require insurers to cover the diagnosis and treatment of
infertility. State Senator Seymour Lachman recently introduced a
similar bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who make $250,000 a year are the ones swinging the
out-of-pocket costs for assisted reproduction,'' said Pamela
Madsen, the executive director of the New York chapter of Resolve,
a support and advocacy group for infertile individuals. ``Maybe
they have to give up the vacation. The more middle class are giving
up their homes, and the working poor are out of it altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   Madsen and her husband gave birth to two children using IVF and,
she said: ``I have four embryos at Mount Sinai waiting for me in
the freezer that I can't access. I'm tapped out, mortgaged out,
credit-carded out. And we were lucky. We got our babies. We still
live in a one-bedroom apartment. We had a nest egg when we got
married; we had health insurance, and the system wasn't there for
us. We are the norm.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without legislation forcing coverage, assisted-reproduction
technology specialists are gearing up for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing more and more patients going to centers, which
increases the volume and lowers the price,'' said Dr. Mark Sauer,
the director of Columbia University's division of reproductive
endocrinology. ``Corporate groups, for-profit groups and HMOs are
learning to split the heavy overhead of a university program like
research, and streamline certain operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Managed care, Dr. Sauer said, could act as a great leveler,
making fertility treatments ``possible for people without the kind
of resources to go to a fee-for-service boutique practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Grifo, the head of New York University Medical
Center's division of reproductive endocrinology, said his group is
negotiating, albeit reluctantly, with a managed-care company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would prefer to control our own fate,'' he said. The
problem is that large institutions like universities have less seed
capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more onerous for them to start and support these kinds of
programs,'' Grifo said.
</P>
<P>
   Economic pressure has whittled the number of large academic
medical institutions where new reproductive technologies are
incubated. The many that remain need high volume, said Dr. Zev
Rosenwaks, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology and the
director of the New York Center for Reproductive Medicine and
Infertility at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have over 100 staffers,'' Rosenwaks said. ``You cannot run
a program that's a good program, that has full research and all
aspects of lab work without having a critical mass of patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cornell program has grown to 750 patients a year from
approximately 250 patients in 1988 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're constantly re-evaluating the costs,'' Rosenwaks added,
while trying to accommodate a changing economic environment. That
requires market savvy, which means, he said, being
patient-friendly, including securing insurance coverage for IVF.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Schmidt-Sarosi, noting that small can be
profitable, said that a successful fertility clinic doesn't need
the ``heavy machinery of an academic setting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do I need an academic telling me how to run my clinic?''
said Schmidt-Sarosi, who recently left the clinical practice at New
York University to open her own practice. ``Our prices are
competitive and lower. I don't have the overhead of hospitals.
Those of us who practice look at what is the out-of-pocket cost. We
streamline, so that if a patient is going to use drugs, we do IVF
faster. It's more efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   As for managed care, she said it will probably bring down IVF
costs to $5,000 per ovulation cycle from $10,000. That could lead
her to consider joining a network of small, high-quality clinics to
negotiate with good insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Other practitioners have devised a kind of money-back guarantee
approach to lowering costs.
</P>
<P>
   At the Shady Grove Fertility Center in Rockville, Md., for
example, patients pay $18,000 up front for three full IVF cycles.
Embryos are frozen and transferred without additional charges. If a
patient doesn't take home a baby, the money, minus a deductible of
$1,250 per cycle, is returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you still have money for adoption,'' said Dr. Michael
Levy, a founder.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Aronson, the executive director of Resolve, warns that
such programs could be an incentive for doctors to implant more
embryos than is medically sound, to maximize the chances of
pregnancy on the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Aronson is also concerned about the possibility of unscrupulous
clinic administrators practicing a bait-and-switch in which they
lure patients with the promise of a money-back guarantee only to
tell them that they don't qualify for that particular program.
</P>
<P>
   Defending his practice, Dr. Levy said that every program could
potentially exploit the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a fee-for-service, it's unnecessary procedures; in
capitated policies with a monetary limit, it's not doing necessary
procedures, and in shared risk, it's by treating patients
differently than you would treat others,'' he said. ``When we
looked at our data on shared risk, we analyzed whether we
transferred more embryos, and we put back exactly the same number
in fee-for-service.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I'd be very happy if there was no need for shared
risk. In France, where it's covered, they do five times the amount
of IVF as we do. There's a lot of politics hidden in this issue.''

Task Force on Life and the Law recognizes as the ``disease'' of
infertility.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky? Indisputably.
</P>
<P>
   First because Carla, a legal assistant, and Bruce, a real-estate
broker, succeeded when the biological odds are stacked against a
41-year-old woman conceiving even with high-tech intervention.
Second because Carla's new insurance carrier, U.S. Healthcare, paid
for the successful round of blood tests, sonograms, laboratory
work, egg harvesting, in-vitro fertilization and implanting the
resulting embryos. All this was performed by one of New York City's
top reproductive medical teams, which was led by Dr. Cecilia
Schmidt-Sarosi and her husband, Dr. Peter Sarosi, reproductive
endocrinologists.
</P>
<P>
   That insurance policy saved Carla and Bruce, who do not want
their last name published, roughly $10,000 that they would have
paid themselves if they had approached the managed-care company
just one month later.
</P>
<P>
   On April 1, U.S. Healthcare, now merged with Aetna, canceled its
coverage of in-vitro fertilization and other high-tech fertility
treatments, making it available to employers only through a rider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we were one of the few programs covering IVF, women
flocked to us who could not find coverage elsewhere,'' said Jill
Griffiths, a spokeswoman for Aetna Healthcare. The policy, she
said, was simply too expensive to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We contacted them in March and when I read that the company
had stopped the policy, my heart just dropped,'' Bruce said. ``But
we lucked out. We got coverage on a shoestring, and we just got in
under the wire.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurance carriers are mostly like poltergeists haunting the
field of reproductive medicine. They materialize with ephemeral
policies that are changed or are withdrawn in a flash.
</P>
<P>
   Only recently, for example, Group Health Insurance, one of the
largest carriers in New York, announced that it is withdrawing its
coverage for all assisted reproductive technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless they operate in states with mandates to cover
infertility treatments, such as Massachusetts, Illinois and
Maryland, managed-care and indemnity insurers have ignored
fertility coverage and gotten away with it,'' said Dr. Norbert
Gleicher, who founded the Center for Human Reproduction, a
Chicago-based chain of fertility treatment centers. ``That's
imminently about to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gleicher, who recently contracted with Oxford Health Plans
to do a joint venture with Columbia University, gave three reasons
for the new interest in fertility coverage:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; VIAGRA. &LR;  The White House decision to require Medicaid coverage
of the drug that treats male sexual dysfunction, and mounting
pressure on private insurance companies to do the same, has opened
the floodgates to sexual-discrimination suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once insurance companies conclude they have to cover Viagra,
how can they not cover female infertility drugs?'' Gleicher asked.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LEGAL PRECEDENT. &LR;  A police officer sued the city of Chicago for
violating the Americans With Disabilities Act, saying infertility
is a disability.
</P>
<P>
   ``A disability is an impairment of a body system that inhibits a
major life activity,'' said Patricia Collins, the lawyer who won
the class-action suit this year. ``The only question is whether
procreation is a major life activity. My position is, if work is a
major life activity, I would hope procreation is as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Susan B. Conlon agreed and the city settled, saying it
would follow Illinois's guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ECONOMICS. &LR;  ``Smart insurance companies are recognizing that it
may be in their interest to cover, even to a limited extent,
infertility because it brings an underground economy in fertility
services above ground,'' Gleicher said.
</P>
<P>
   He explained that doctors often perform infertility treatments,
like tubal surgeries, and list them as a different, often more
costly procedure so that patients can secure coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In a study to be published in September, William M. Mercer, a
firm of human-resource consultants, concludes that the hidden costs
of infertility treatments range from 27 cents to 50 cents a month
for each member of the insurance plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending on co-pay arrangements and how well the plans are
managed, it would cost in the neighborhood of 40 cents to 50 cents
to provide coverage,'' said Lisa Astor, a consultant at Mercer.
```Our thoughts are that employers are already paying for
infertility whether they know it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a wave of consumer anger over the right to
reproduce that threatens to engulf lawmakers in several states,
including New York.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman David S. Sidikman has introduced a bill that would
require insurers to cover the diagnosis and treatment of
infertility. State Senator Seymour Lachman recently introduced a
similar bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who make $250,000 a year are the ones swinging the
out-of-pocket costs for assisted reproduction,'' said Pamela
Madsen, the executive director of the New York chapter of Resolve,
a support and advocacy group for infertile individuals. ``Maybe
they have to give up the vacation. The more middle class are giving
up their homes, and the working poor are out of it altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   Madsen and her husband gave birth to two children using IVF and,
she said: ``I have four embryos at Mount Sinai waiting for me in
the freezer that I can't access. I'm tapped out, mortgaged out,
credit-carded out. And we were lucky. We got our babies. We still
live in a one-bedroom apartment. We had a nest egg when we got
married; we had health insurance, and the system wasn't there for
us. We are the norm.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without legislation forcing coverage, assisted-reproduction
technology specialists are gearing up for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing more and more patients going to centers, which
increases the volume and lowers the price,'' said Dr. Mark Sauer,
the director of Columbia University's division of reproductive
endocrinology. ``Corporate groups, for-profit groups and HMOs are
learning to split the heavy overhead of a university program like
research, and streamline certain operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Managed care, Dr. Sauer said, could act as a great leveler,
making fertility treatments ``possible for people without the kind
of resources to go to a fee-for-service boutique practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Grifo, the head of New York University Medical
Center's division of reproductive endocrinology, said his group is
negotiating, albeit reluctantly, with a managed-care company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would prefer to control our own fate,'' he said. The
problem is that large institutions like universities have less seed
capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more onerous for them to start and support these kinds of
programs,'' Grifo said.
</P>
<P>
   Economic pressure has whittled the number of large academic
medical institutions where new reproductive technologies are
incubated. The many that remain need high volume, said Dr. Zev
Rosenwaks, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology and the
director of the New York Center for Reproductive Medicine and
Infertility at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have over 100 staffers,'' Rosenwaks said. ``You cannot run
a program that's a good program, that has full research and all
aspects of lab work without having a critical mass of patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cornell program has grown to 750 patients a year from
approximately 250 patients in 1988 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're constantly re-evaluating the costs,'' Rosenwaks added,
while trying to accommodate a changing economic environment. That
requires market savvy, which means, he said, being
patient-friendly, including securing insurance coverage for IVF.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Schmidt-Sarosi, noting that small can be
profitable, said that a successful fertility clinic doesn't need
the ``heavy machinery of an academic setting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do I need an academic telling me how to run my clinic?''
said Schmidt-Sarosi, who recently left the clinical practice at New
York University to open her own practice. ``Our prices are
competitive and lower. I don't have the overhead of hospitals.
Those of us who practice look at what is the out-of-pocket cost. We
streamline, so that if a patient is going to use drugs, we do IVF
faster. It's more efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   As for managed care, she said it will probably bring down IVF
costs to $5,000 per ovulation cycle from $10,000. That could lead
her to consider joining a network of small, high-quality clinics to
negotiate with good insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Other practitioners have devised a kind of money-back guarantee
approach to lowering costs.
</P>
<P>
   At the Shady Grove Fertility Center in Rockville, Md., for
example, patients pay $18,000 up front for three full IVF cycles.
Embryos are frozen and transferred without additional charges. If a
patient doesn't take home a baby, the money, minus a deductible of
$1,250 per cycle, is returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you still have money for adoption,'' said Dr. Michael
Levy, a founder.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Aronson, the executive director of Resolve, warns that
such programs could be an incentive for doctors to implant more
embryos than is medically sound, to maximize the chances of
pregnancy on the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Aronson is also concerned about the possibility of unscrupulous
clinic administrators practicing a bait-and-switch in which they
lure patients with the promise of a money-back guarantee only to
tell them that they don't qualify for that particular program.
</P>
<P>
   Defending his practice, Dr. Levy said that every program could
potentially exploit the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a fee-for-service, it's unnecessary procedures; in
capitated policies with a monetary limit, it's not doing necessary
procedures, and in shared risk, it's by treating patients
differently than you would treat others,'' he said. ``When we
looked at our data on shared risk, we analyzed whether we
transferred more embryos, and we put back exactly the same number
in fee-for-service.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I'd be very happy if there was no need for shared
risk. In France, where it's covered, they do five times the amount
of IVF as we do. There's a lot of politics hidden in this issue.''

<P>
   It has never been easier to have cosmetic surgery and other
beauty-enhancing procedures than now.
</P>
<P>
   More cosmetic surgeons are setting up shop as baby boomers are
looking longer in the mirror and seeing sags and wrinkles. New
lasers and other technologies keep coming out with the promise of
better results.
</P>
<P>
   And money is no longer an obstacle. Finance companies offering
to lend you the money in as little as 24 hours are advertising on
television, radio and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As one advertisement on the Web proposes, ``Why wait?''
</P>
<P>
   Industry figures indicate that fewer people are waiting and that
most of them are women.
</P>
<P>
   The number of liposuction operations, the most popular form of
cosmetic surgery, increased 215 percent to 149,042 from 47,212
between 1992 and 1997, according to the latest statistics from the
American Academy of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons in
Arlington Heights, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   More breast enlargements, eyelid lifts and face lifts are also
being done. Indeed, plastic surgeons performed 32,607 breast
augmentations in 1992; five years later, they did 122,285.
</P>
<P>
   The higher numbers reflect the fact that cosmetic surgery is
more acceptable and that people feel more pressured to look good
and age well.
</P>
<P>
   But many doctors say that the risk of complications is also
rising as record numbers of doctors and patients enter an
essentially unregulated field.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole influx of folks into cosmetic surgery with a
whole variety of backgrounds, some with just a weekend course,''
said Dr. Dennis Lynch, the president of the American Academy of
Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons. ``Some of these physicians may
not even have a background in surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   And they don't have to be certified by the state or any medical
board to do this surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said that doctors are attracted to cosmetic surgery
because it is more lucrative than many other areas of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not something that insurance reimburses, so there's
cash up front, without restrictions from managed care,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are no national or statewide statistics on complications
and deaths from esthetic procedures. But since last fall, Lynch has
heard of 13 patients around the United States who have died from
liposuction.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, he said, he knew of just four or five such deaths
in the three years before last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frequently the deaths involved surgeons misjudging what
patients can handle,'' he said, by taking out too much fat during
liposuction and doing a face lift simultaneously or operating on
patients with health problems that make the surgery high risk.
``There may be other deaths. This information tends to be concealed
in legal actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Established cosmetic surgeons say that more patients are asking
them to fix complications from procedures performed by other
doctors: impaired vision and even blindness from damage incurred
during eyelid lifts; eyelids that don't close completely because
too much skin was removed from the lower lid to eliminate bags;
internal injuries from liposuction; permanent skin discoloration
from laser treatment of wrinkles. Many doctors say the need for
repair work is partly linked to the lack of licensing and
regulation in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike, say, heart surgery, which can be performed only by
board-certified cardiologists under state laws, cosmetic surgery
can be performed by any licensed doctor. Any dentist can bleach or
bond teeth. And since esthetic procedures are usually performed in
doctors' offices, those doctors do not need to be affiliated with
hospitals, which places them outside professional peer reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the risks, doctors say, is that new technology and
techniques are appearing with record speed and heralded with more
aggressive publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything happens so much faster now, and evaluation of new
procedures and instruments is difficult,'' said Dr. Gerald H.
Pitman, a plastic surgeon in Manhattan and the author of a textbook
on liposuction.
</P>
<P>
   Because these procedures are often rushed to the market without
clinical trials, problems usually come to light after the work is
done.
 &UR; THE SAFE BETS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A patient's best hedge against complications and poor results is
to choose an experienced, well-qualified doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't do that by looking on the Web,'' Pitman said,
referring to the hundreds of doctors who publicize their practices
on Internet home pages. He suggested that people begin by obtaining
the names of doctors from friends who are satisfied with their
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get a name, ask physicians you know to check up on the
person,'' he said. ``Or ask your own doctors for names of plastic
surgeons.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors tend to specialize in, say, liposuction or face lifts,
so people should look for someone whose expertise lies in the
procedure being considered, Dr. Lynch noted.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor should be board-certified in plastic surgery or
another specialty that involves esthetic procedures, he added. The
field of expertise should be accepted by the American Board of
Medical Specialties, the organization that sets standards for
specialized medical training and practice. These specialties
include plastic surgery, which comprises cosmetic surgery like
liposuction and face lifts; reconstructive surgery to repair damage
from accidents or diseases; ophthalmology for eyelid lifts; ear,
nose and throat surgery for face lifts and rhinoplasty; and
dermatology for collagen injections and similar wrinkle treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The cosmetic surgery board is not a member of the American Board
of Medical Specialties, which makes a board-certified cosmetic
surgeon akin to an unaccredited university, said Dr. Steven Miller,
the American board's executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Dolsky, a past president of the American Academy of
Cosmetic Surgery, takes issue with that view, saying that
board-certified cosmetic surgeons are well trained in cosmetic
procedures. Many are also board-certified in member specialties,
like plastic surgery or dermatology, he said.
</P>
<P>
   When evaluating doctors, it is important to ask whether they
have privileges at a hospital, Lynch said, adding, ``That means
that they have to meet standards set by the hospital, even if they
do most of their surgery in their own offices.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the doctor's operating suite should be accredited
and evaluated by an organization like the American Association for
the Accreditation of Ambulatory Facilities or the Joint Commission
on the Accreditation of Health Care Organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Accreditation means that an outpatient clinic meets certain
standards, like being equipped to handle an emergency if surgery
goes wrong. But accreditation of all out-patient operating rooms is
mandatory in just nine states, including New Jersey, California,
Maryland and Pennsylvania. (It is pending in New York.)
</P>
<P>
   When meeting with a doctor, potential patients should ask what
they can expect _ not only how the work can improve their looks,
but the chances that they will need a second procedure to achieve
acceptable results. Even topflight surgeons' handiwork can be
imperfect, Lynch said. As much as 10 percent to 15 percent of nose
jobs, he added, need to be repeated to correct breathing problems
or to finesse one's appearance. ``Patients need to know that
cosmetic surgery is not a magic bullet,'' he said.

liposuction and face lifts; reconstructive surgery to repair damage
from accidents or diseases; ophthalmology for eyelid lifts; ear,
nose and throat surgery for face lifts and rhinoplasty; and
dermatology for collagen injections and similar wrinkle treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The cosmetic surgery board is not a member of the American Board
of Medical Specialties, which makes a board-certified cosmetic
surgeon akin to an unaccredited university, said Dr. Steven Miller,
the American board's executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Dolsky, a past president of the American Academy of
Cosmetic Surgery, takes issue with that view, saying that
board-certified cosmetic surgeons are well trained in cosmetic
procedures. Many are also board-certified in member specialties,
like plastic surgery or dermatology, he said.
</P>
<P>
   When evaluating doctors, it is important to ask whether they
have privileges at a hospital, Lynch said, adding, ``That means
that they have to meet standards set by the hospital, even if they
do most of their surgery in their own offices.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the doctor's operating suite should be accredited
and evaluated by an organization like the American Association for
the Accreditation of Ambulatory Facilities or the Joint Commission
on the Accreditation of Health Care Organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Accreditation means that an outpatient clinic meets certain
standards, like being equipped to handle an emergency if surgery
goes wrong. But accreditation of all out-patient operating rooms is
mandatory in just nine states, including New Jersey, California,
Maryland and Pennsylvania. (It is pending in New York.)
</P>
<P>
   When meeting with a doctor, potential patients should ask what
they can expect _ not only how the work can improve their looks,
but the chances that they will need a second procedure to achieve
acceptable results. Even topflight surgeons' handiwork can be
imperfect, Lynch said. As much as 10 percent to 15 percent of nose
jobs, he added, need to be repeated to correct breathing problems
or to finesse one's appearance. ``Patients need to know that
cosmetic surgery is not a magic bullet,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Five years ago, a much-wanted pregnancy at age 37 prompted me to
seek prenatal testing.
</P>
<P>
   I had of course been prepared for the possibility of bad news.
But the test results posed a harrowing dilemma unlike anything I
had anticipated or been warned to expect.
</P>
<P>
   The grainy picture on the ultrasound machine showed a glorious
baby. At 16 weeks, it had a gracefully arched spine and a classic
Roman profile.
</P>
<P>
   As my doctor maneuvered the syringe in my womb to get a sample
of amniotic fluid, the baby suddenly grasped in the direction of
the intruding object. ``That's a reflex response they sometimes
have to the fluid being disturbed,'' the doctor said.
</P>
<P>
   The report from our genetic counselor was ominous. The fetus was
male, he haltingly began his call. It appeared to be normal _
except for an alteration on one chromosome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for?'' I screamed, prompting my husband to pick up the
other line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The baby is probably healthy,'' the counselor reassured us.
``In fact, if either of you have the same chromosome alteration the
fetus will be at no increased risk whatsoever. You'd be living
proof that the abnormality had no harmful effect.''
</P>
<P>
   He described the alteration in detail: a large segment of
chromosome 2 had done a 180-degree flip upside down known as an
inversion.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if neither of us has this defect?'' my husband asked.
</P>
<P>
   The baby still might be fine, the counselor said _ assuming no
gene had been lost in the reshuffling. But if even a fraction of a
gene had been nicked or scrambled, the consequences could be
terrible. He might be born deformed or retarded and suffer from
multiple disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The chance of that happening, our counselor estimated, was
probably in the 5 percent to 10 percent range. A baby in the
overall population, the counselor reminded us, has a 2 percent to 3
percent risk of being born with a serious congenital anomaly.
</P>
<P>
   The next step, we agreed, was genetic testing for my husband and
me. If either of us had the defect, our worries would be over.
</P>
<P>
   A week later the news wasn't good; the inversion was the baby's.
</P>
<P>
   I accepted the news in my measured reporter mode, then hung up
the phone and howled. What were we to do with this information?
</P>
<P>
   Based on my knowledge and our pretest counseling, I viewed
amniocentesis as a test for Down's syndrome and other gross
chromosomal defects whose effects are debilitating or devastating
to a majority of those affected.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, I saw the standard battery of tests performed
during prenatal screening as highly predictive and the information
of unquestionable utility.
</P>
<P>
   What I didn't know was that amniocentesis has become adept at
detecting tiny imperfections whose implications vary wildly. The
inversion detected in our fetus is one of many such smaller
defects, collectively known as chromosome structural abnormalities.
Accounting for one in every six hereditary aberrations detected by
amniocentesis in women over 35, they include microscopic deletions,
duplications and rearrangements that are highly idiosyncratic.
</P>
<P>
   In a face-to-face, hourlong meeting, our genetic counselor gave
us facts, such as they were. But he could shed little light on our
predicament. Various registries, which keep track of chromosome
abnormalities and their clinical implications, had been consulted,
but he was not aware of any other case like ours.
</P>
<P>
   We stared, mystified, at our son's stained chromosomes splayed
in black-and-white bands. Just how had our counselor come up with a
5 percent to 10 percent risk?
</P>
<P>
   Turns out this estimate was based on a single study of fewer
than 50 cases of similar inversions detected in fetuses electively
aborted or carried to term.
</P>
<P>
   With such a small sample size, the reliability of the odds we
had been given was dubious. But that didn't diminish the study's
power to shock. A table of abnormal outcomes listed a menagerie of
horrors: children with mushroom heads, clouded eyes and other
cruelties too awful to contemplate.
</P>
<P>
   My husband remained undaunted. The ultrasound at 16 weeks, he
pointed out, had been normal. If anything was wrong, it was
probably something minor that could be corrected. What's more, if I
continued the pregnancy, our genetic counselor had recommended a
final ultrasound scan at 20 weeks _ just before the legal cutoff
point for a late-stage abortion in Florida. Surely, he argued,
serious malformations would be detected then.
</P>
<P>
   I was not so reassured. Schooled in the intricacies of
developmental biology, I knew that an imperceptible error _ a
faulty hemoglobin molecule, a single missing enzyme in the brain or
liver _ could spell doom as surely as a grave deformity.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, the reality sunk in: We would have to make our
decision.
</P>
<P>
   My husband and I debated proceeding with the pregnancy. The
risk, in his view, was scary but not sufficient to warrant an
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   I, on the other hand, vacillated: One moment I was convinced the
risk to the fetus was negligible; the next moment I was conjuring
images of the monstrous ways a child could be wrenched from the
human template.
</P>
<P>
   During all this I got a call from a friend who has worn many
hats in his life, from internist and molecular biologist to medical
director of a company marketing genetic tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congratulations, I hear you're pregnant,'' he said, as if his
wife had not told him that the baby had a genetic abnormality. But
he was taking his cues from me and remained matter-of-fact,
answering technical questions and nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   As our conversation ended, I finally asked, ``If you and your
wife were in my position what would you do?''
</P>
<P>
   The pause was so long I thought he hadn't heard me. Then in a
calm, clear voice he announced, ``I'd advise her in no uncertain
terms to terminate the pregnancy.''
</P>
<P>
   I gasped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry,'' he said, ``but you asked.''
</P>
<P>
   I tried to console myself that my choice would be clearer in
time. But each day I grew more muddled. I couldn't eat or sleep; I
dropped six pounds in almost as many days.
</P>
<P>
   One day, my husband finally said: ``I just want you to know that
I love you, and that your opinion counts most to me. It's your
body. Whatever you decide to do I'll respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Later I told him my decision: I wanted an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was veering in that direction myself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   My ob-gyn nobly agreed to do the abortion. But we made a pact:
The report of the fetal autopsy would be sent to a genetic registry
so that other couples might benefit from the findings. However, I
did not want to know the results.
</P>
<P>
   How do I feel about my choice now? There is sorrow _ how could
there not be? But fate has been good to me. Almost a year to the
day after the abortion, a screaming baby girl with ear-piercing
good health was delivered into my arms. Two years later, we were
blessed with a robust son, now a delightful 1-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   There is something else. I know the results of the fetal autopsy
because they were sent to our home by mistake.
</P>
<P>
   According to the pathologist, the baby seemed to have
``crushing'' deformities probably owing to insufficient amniotic
fluid in the womb _ a not-uncommon consequence of genetic defects.
Without adequate room to develop, the baby's facial features had
grown distorted, and all the joints had been damaged, suggesting
that it would not have had the use of its limbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must feel vindicated,'' a friend said after I told her the
news.
</P>
<P>
   Not really. Vindicated suggests there was a right or wrong
choice to make. But if there is a moral to my story, it is that
there is no moral. Embarking down the path of prenatal testing, I
did not foresee where it might lead, and I made my choice without
knowing what the future held.

<P>
   Every day Marcie Rothman, who is 51, takes three Body Wise
Female Advantage nutritional capsules _ an arsenal of 22
ingredients marketed as the natural answer to menopause.
</P>
<P>
   Soy protein is a selective estrogen-response modifier meant to
stabilize a woman's suddenly dwindling supply of estrogen; along
with black cohosh root, it is now a popular way to fight hot
flashes. Mexican yam is a trendy natural source of progesterone,
and passionflower, valerian root and kava are supposed to
ameliorate mood swings.
</P>
<P>
   The capsules also contain evening primrose oil and flax seed for
essential fatty acids, as well as gotu kola and alphaketoglutaric
acid, both of which are supposed to keep the brain sharp.
</P>
<P>
   Add vitamin pills, a calcium supplement to fight osteoporosis,
exercise, a no-smoking policy and a low-fat diet, and Rothman
figures that she has done everything she needs to do.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Rothman, a former magazine researcher who now writes
about food and nutrition, is helping to support a $4 billion
alternative-remedy industry by dosing herself with nontraditional
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago she would have been at the fringe of consumer
society. Today, she is a foot soldier in a revolution that includes
members of the medical establishment, like Dr. Susan M. Love, who
co-wrote ``Dr. Susan Love's Hormone Dilemma,'' and Dr. David Heber,
the director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the University of
California, Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Women, who buy the majority of medicines and medicinal
treatments, have a dizzying array of products at their disposal.
What these products do not have yet is quantifiable proof either of
quality or of effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   No regulatory agency enforces quality control of these
supplements, and there are not nearly enough scientific data to
confirm that their ingredients do what they profess.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a resurgence of a romantic idea about nature,'' said
Dr. Richard Friedman, the director of psychopharmacology at New
York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. ``Like all ideology, it's
dangerous. The bottom line should be, if it works and it's safe and
effective, what does it matter where it came from? Molecules are
molecules.''
</P>
<P>
   Before 1994, the government categorized dietary supplements as
food additives. Companies had to prove their products' safety to
the Food and Drug Administration, which could yank an item off the
shelf.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act put the
burden of proof on the FDA, which lacks the resources to police a
growing industry. Even proponents of these treatments worry that
women will end up with poor-quality products.
</P>
<P>
   ``My practical advice for right now is, go with one of the big
herbal companies,'' Heber said. ``Big companies have big insurance
liabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman added, ``It's buyer beware. You might get a treatment,
a potentially toxic substance or a placebo. It's Russian
roulette.''

   The standard alternative approach to dealing with the long-term
effects of menopause _ bone weakness, cardiovascular problems and
skin dryness _ depends on natural sources of depleted hormones,
along with specific remedies for short-term discomforts like hot
flashes.
</P>
<P>
   It usually involves a progesterone cream, of which Progest is
the oldest and most popular brand, and a phyto- or plant-derived
estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Soy-protein powder is the phyto-estrogen of the moment. Women
usually mix it into fruit juice or milk twice a day, though many
who take it look forward to the day when an equivalent batch of
isoflavones are packed into a flavorless capsule.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are mavericks like Dr. Uzzi Reiss, a Beverly Hills
gynecologist and anti-aging specialist who says he has a ``booked
practice, early morning to late at night'' concocting custom
hormone cocktails for his patients.
</P>
<P>
   If the herbalists and nutritionists believe that Premarin is
unnecessary, Reiss and his colleagues believe it is outmoded.
</P>
<P>
   Menopause is the wild frontier for alternative entrepreneurs,
with 1.3 million women very likely to be entering menopause this
year. But even established companies, like Transitions for Women,
which sells Progest cream and is based in Oregon, depend more on
patient testimonials than on research.
</P>
<P>
   Rothman's proof of efficacy is simple but also profound: She
began taking supplements five years ago, when her stress level
spiraled because of her parents' illnesses and a fractured romance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had as much as a sore throat since,'' she said. Nor
any menopausal symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   The medical community prefers a broader sampling and has finally
acknowledged public interest by beginning to research popular
products.
</P>
<P>
   Love includes soy-rich foods and herbs in her daily regimen.
While ``we need more randomized, controlled double-blind studies,''
she said, referring to the ``gold standard'' in which half the
subjects receive an alternate remedy and half a placebo, she points
out that women are frequently prescribed drugs for which such
studies were not conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The requirement for gold-standard studies has to be seen in
perspective,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she keeps an eye on the emerging data. She had been
taking 25 grams of soy powder every day, for example, until a
recent double-blind study suggested 40 grams was optimal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bumped it up to 40,'' she said, ``and the hot flashes
disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   Heber mixes four scoops, about 30 grams, of soy protein in a
drink twice a day because studies on animals suggest there is a
cancer-fighting, or antioxidant effect.
</P>
<P>
   But there is much trial and error in dosage and effectiveness;
for all the popularity of topical progesterone preparations, for
example, the FDA has yet to limit the progesterone content. What
works is often a matter of experimentation and individual
perception.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most hopeful sign,'' Friedman said, ``is that the National
Institute of Medicine has its agency of alternative health, and
they're doing studies now. You have to ask: If I'm going to put
this in my body, is it safe? What does it mean if a lot of
menopausal women say they're feeling better on something? Did it
work, or did they feel better because of the placebo effect?''
</P>
<P>
   Women are generally disinclined to wait for official answers and
prefer to apply their networking skills in an informal menopause
information exchange. There are several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   This generation's distrust of authority has been heightened by
managed care _ having promised everything, medicine has delivered
far less.
</P>
<P>
   This generation also has a global perspective. Thanks to an
enhanced ability to travel abroad or on the Internet, women can
learn about other cultures and treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby boomers are a major revolution, 77 million of us thinking
we can change the world and live to 120,'' Heber said. ``An
internationalization of economies means we're getting an influx of
information from cultures that like natural remedies. In China,
they don't take Premarin.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that the baby boomers' curiosity, combined with
their mistrust of the pharmaceutical-medical establishment and the
torrent of data, has made the current menopause generation more
responsive to promotions for products that are, for the most part,
untested and unregulated.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say pharmaceutical companies ignore profit
projections. But drugs, unlike ``cosmeceuticals,'' undergo rigorous
clinical trials to win FDA approval.
</P>
<P>
   The danger is that women are doing their own informal clinical
trials, and that most doctors cannot keep up with them.
</P>
<P>
   Practitioners who recommend alternative remedies urge women to
find what Love calls a ``guide'' who knows which companies make the
best products and how they are supposed to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just take two of these and three of those,'' Love
said. ``You have to go to a herbalist, a naturopath, a traditional
Chinese doctor and have them match the herbs to your needs. You
hear what a friend takes, and you try that? Not a good idea. So go
to someone who knows what they're doing. That's your only
safeguard.''

<P>
   Every day Marcie Rothman, who is 51, takes three Body Wise
Female Advantage nutritional capsules _ an arsenal of 22
ingredients marketed as the natural answer to menopause.
</P>
<P>
   Soy protein is a selective estrogen-response modifier meant to
stabilize a woman's suddenly dwindling supply of estrogen; along
with black cohosh root, it is now a popular way to fight hot
flashes. Mexican yam is a trendy natural source of progesterone,
and passionflower, valerian root and kava are supposed to
ameliorate mood swings.
</P>
<P>
   The capsules also contain evening primrose oil and flax seed for
essential fatty acids, as well as gotu kola and alphaketoglutaric
acid, both of which are supposed to keep the brain sharp.
</P>
<P>
   Add vitamin pills, a calcium supplement to fight osteoporosis,
exercise, a no-smoking policy and a low-fat diet, and Rothman
figures that she has done everything she needs to do.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Rothman, a former magazine researcher who now writes
about food and nutrition, is helping to support a $4 billion
alternative-remedy industry by dosing herself with nontraditional
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago she would have been at the fringe of consumer
society. Today, she is a foot soldier in a revolution that includes
members of the medical establishment, like Dr. Susan M. Love, who
co-wrote ``Dr. Susan Love's Hormone Dilemma,'' and Dr. David Heber,
the director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the University of
California, Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Women, who buy the majority of medicines and medicinal
treatments, have a dizzying array of products at their disposal.
What these products do not have yet is quantifiable proof either of
quality or of effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   No regulatory agency enforces quality control of these
supplements, and there are not nearly enough scientific data to
confirm that their ingredients do what they profess.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a resurgence of a romantic idea about nature,'' said
Dr. Richard Friedman, the director of psychopharmacology at New
York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. ``Like all ideology, it's
dangerous. The bottom line should be, if it works and it's safe and
effective, what does it matter where it came from? Molecules are
molecules.''
</P>
<P>
   Before 1994, the government categorized dietary supplements as
food additives. Companies had to prove their products' safety to
the Food and Drug Administration, which could yank an item off the
shelf.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act put the
burden of proof on the FDA, which lacks the resources to police a
growing industry. Even proponents of these treatments worry that
women will end up with poor-quality products.
</P>
<P>
   ``My practical advice for right now is, go with one of the big
herbal companies,'' Heber said. ``Big companies have big insurance
liabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman added, ``It's buyer beware. You might get a treatment,
a potentially toxic substance or a placebo. It's Russian
roulette.''
</P>

   The standard alternative approach to dealing with the long-term

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: A real-life Viagra joke
 &HT;    (For release Sunday, June 28, 1998.)
 &HT;    (Eds: Bocaiuva do Sul in 5th graf is cq.)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The introduction of Viagra to the market has done more than just
resurrect sex lives. It has offered us some relief from the
ferocity of thousands of Monica Lewinsky-Bill Clinton jokes.
</P>
<P>
   The creativity of the public in originating Viagra jokes by the
hundreds is to be admired, although most of them are predictable
and unfunny. So were the Lewinsky-Clinton jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly, we have a new Viagra joke each minute of each day _
and some are based on real-life situations, such as the woman who
sued because her 70ish husband, fortified with Viagra, began
playing the field again after years of dormancy.
</P>
<P>
   A newer story involving Viagra also comes, not in the form of a
ribald joke, but as real life. This, too, can lead to a new genre
of jokes, if not bureaucratic gestures.
</P>
<P>
   In the southern Brazilian town of Bocaiuva do Sul, the mayor is
using Viagra as a key ingredient for participation in Brazil's
formulized revenue sharing.
</P>
<P>
   With the population of his community down to 8,750, Mayor Elcio
Berti has said he will distribute Viagra free to his townsfolk.
Behind it is a shrewd political and economic concept.
</P>
<P>
   The more people in town, the more financial aid the town gets
from the federal government. I am uncertain of the principal
industry of Bocaiuva do Sul but I am beginning to suspect it is
procreation. One wire story more or less confirms this by claiming
federal aid is the main source of income for this town.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier effort to jumpstart the population, the mayor
tried to ban condoms but it was ruled unconstitutional by a judge.
Now, along comes Viagra and Mayor Berti can look at the population
issue from an entirely different perspective.
</P>
<P>
   There are several obstacles to Berti's plan, not the least of
which is fertility. But, also, health authorities in the Brazilian
state of Parana, where Bocaiuva do Sul is situated, are wondering
aloud about the mayor's right to dispense a prescription drug.
</P>
<P>
   He claims he has spent $35,000 from his own pocket on this
project, so one must assume that it will come back to him in some
form of covert reimbursement if and when incremental funds arrive
from the Brazilian feds. The waiting period of fund anticipation,
due to natural necessities, will be no less than nine months.
</P>
<P>
   Also, I wonder to myself, how does the mayor plan to get the
pills from their U.S. manufacturer, Pfizer? Does he go to his local
doctor and get him to write a prescription for several thousand
Viagra pills?
</P>
<P>
   What is the problem with his town in the first place? Are all
the men over 65; is that why they need help in the propagation
process? Or is it that the younger men (and, of course, the women)
aren't interested in having children by the carload? Or is it
because something has happened down there to bring on an epidemic
of impotency upon the entire male population?
</P>
<P>
   No matter which, the mayor has introduced to the world the
formula for a unique form of economic growth. One only can hope
that other cities and towns in Brazil, some of them horribly
overpopulated, do not embrace the same scheme to reap even more
funds into their coffers.
</P>
<P>
   Of particular interest is that the mayor plans to distribute the
pill personally, contending he knows 90 percent of the men in town.
It is reported that Viagra sells for more than $25 a pop in Brazil,
and the mayor is concerned that Brazilians from afar will turn up
in his town for a free, stimulating handout.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest he give the outsiders placebos; he's already increased
the population simply by getting them there. He now just needs a
good gate to keep them in.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Court confirms _ Constitution applies to Alabama
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has kissed off another attempt by Alabama to
finagle prayer into public classrooms. The court continues to hold,
contrary to the declared position of the state's governor, that the
Constitution applies to Alabama. The justices' persistence in the
conceit is touching, though still of indifferent effect.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling ought to put paid to the school-prayer hustle, but
then so should have all the other like rulings since 1963. School
prayer is a sure-fire pheromone to a certain genus of politician.
Humping as always these days to appease their party's religious
right, congressional Republicans and GOP presidential hopefuls, for
instance, bawl for its restoration.
</P>
<P>
   And, really, how much would it matter if we bored just a teeny
hole in the wall of church-state separation? Well, maybe we can
guess at the consequences from some of the abuses that occur
despite the intact wall.
</P>
<P>
   In a suburban school district in the South, a foreign-language
teacher offers 10 bonus points to students who say ``I love Jesus''
in the language. Jewish kids who do so are then quizzed by the
teacher about whether they really mean it. When they say they just
want the extra credit, they're knocked down to three points.
</P>
<P>
   A city cheerleading coach encourages _ and seems almost to be
expecting _ student attendance at meetings of the Christian
Fellowship of Student Athletes.
</P>
<P>
   A teacher in Tennessee uses biblical citations in classroom
lessons so incessantly that, according to an investigator of the
matter, teaching turns into preaching.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, Jewish parents in one district had to seek court
protection for their kids from proselytizing school officials, and
in another district a court-appointed monitor is working to tamp
down schoolhouse evangelism.
</P>
<P>
   The Southeastern office of the Anti-Defamation League logs whole
categories of ongoing problems: Schools selling faddish WWJD wrist
bands _ What Would Jesus Do _ to raise money, for instance, and
teacher and administrator prayers over classroom loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine how much more charged the atmosphere would be if
children were, in effect, forced either to go along with classroom
prayer or ostracize themselves. Most proponents of school prayer,
at least the ones outside politics, are sincere in believing
society somehow would be healed by it.
</P>
<P>
   What they fail to understand is that Christian prayer would mark
off the children of minority religions _ a growing number, with
Muslim and Hindu immigration _ as The Other, exotics rather than
classmates. School prayer enforces division; it doesn't heal it.
</P>
<P>
   In its latest run at the wall, Alabama tried to get around that
by requiring that prayers be nonsectarian, but what's the point of
that? A prayer that could be equally intended for Hera as for any
other deity offends and trivializes faith rather than honoring it.
Prayers like that are the empty calories of religion. They nurture
no spiritual growth.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Education has published guidelines
showing just how, and just how much, religion can constitutionally
be part of student life. Quite a lot, it turns out. How odd to hold
that the only scholastic faith that could possibly matter is the
unconstitutional sort.

VIAGRA'S OTHER SIDE EFFECT : UPSETS IN MANY A MARRIAGE Therapists
and experts on sexuality are finding that Viagra, the popular new
drug for impotence, may actually throw into chaos some
relationships that have fallen into their own routine, sexual
dysfunction and all. By Jennifer Steinhauer. New York Times Science
Times. 1,500 words.

HAIR ANALYSIS YIELDS CLUES TO HEROIN DEATHS Hair analysis of 37
people who died from heroin overdose in Italy reveals that they had
taken little or no heroin in the months before their last injection
of the potent narcotic. The findings suggest that the risk of
heroin overdose is particularly high for addicts who go back to the
drug after quitting for a time, and for so-called 'recreational' or
'weekend' users who inject heroin only occasionally, a pattern of
heroin use that is becoming increasingly common. By Michael
McCarthy. The Lancet News Service. 1,000 words.

 &HT;    CHINESE CHIEF AWAITS CLINTON IN THE COMPOUND WHERE MAO CAVORTED
 &HT;    With CHINA-CLINTON; CHINA-HISTBOX-$ADV27.
 &HT;    For Use Saturday, June 27 And Thereafter.

<P>
   BEIJING _ Chinese artisans have been renovating a secluded
waterside pavilion inside the communist leadership compound where
President Bill Clinton is expected to hold some of his most
sensitive talks.
</P>
<P>
   The 213-acre complex called Zhongnanhai has no equivalent in
America. It is a Beijing-style amalgam of the White House, Camp
David, parts of Georgetown and an incumbent president's national
party headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Last month President Jiang Zemin told visiting U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright that the vermilion-walled compound was
being spruced up for the Clinton visit.
</P>
<P>
   Zhongnanhai means ``the Central and South Seas,'' a name taken
from two lakes within the walls that were once part of the imperial
palace grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The compound is not just China's seat of the ruling Communist
Party politburo and the government's State Council. It is also
where the patriarch Mao Tse-tung used to live. A few of Mao's
former revolutionary comrades-in-arms still have apartments here,
and so do some of China's senior and not-so-senior leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also the Chinese analog of the White House
Communications Agency, the place where Chinese leaders have located
the secure ``hot line'' for urgent communications with U.S.
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Zhongnanhai is where China has held all important private talks
for the last quarter-century with American leaders, starting with
U.S. National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger's secret mission in
1971. Visiting French, Russian and other top officials also have
been received here.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, it is where Jiang has granted interviews to
well-connected visiting journalists. In the last month, Jiang has
spoken here with columnist Lally Weymouth, the daughter of retired
Washington Post publisher Katherine Graham, and with Agence France
Press board chairman Jean Miot.
</P>
<P>
   A generation ago, Zhongnanhai had quite different uses.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s and 60s, this was where Mao held weekly ballroom
dancing sessions with a stable of beautiful young Chinese women
chosen for their ``political reliability,'' according to the
memoirs of Mao's personal physician Li Zhisui.
</P>
<P>
   The dancers were peasant girls assigned to the Cultural Work
Troupe of the Central Garrison Corps, the doctor wrote in 1994
memoirs that have not been refuted. ``He (Mao) was happiest and
most satisfied when he had several young women simultaneously
sharing his bed,'' wrote Mao's personal physician from 1955 through
the Great Helmsman's death in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Long before that, Zhongnanhai was also the site of pleasure
pavilions for Qing dynasty emperors, who built the compound as an
extension of the Forbidden City during the 18th century reign of
emperor Qian Long.
</P>
<P>
   Situated on an island near the compound's center is the stately
Pavilion of the Soaring Phoenixes. It is famous among Chinese
scholars as the gilded prison where the young reform-minded Emperor
Guanxu was held under house arrest starting in 1898.
</P>
<P>
   The young emperor was confined for a decade by power-hungry
Empress Dowager Cixi. He spent much of the time in the Soaring
Phoenixes pavilion while imperial China teetered toward its final
collapse in 1911.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang told the U.S. secretary of state that the pavilion under
renovation for the Clinton visit dated from the Qing Dynasty
(1644-1911). It was not disclosed whether Jiang was speaking of the
same pavilion where Emperor Guanxu was detained.
</P>
<P>
   Zhongnanhai became the center of power in revolutionary China in
the fall of 1949. It was just after the communist takeover, and
many of the guerrilla fighters set up their apartments and offices
on the water's edge inside the complex. Mao took one of the most
spacious.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, the tranquility ended when China was convulsed by the
Cultural Revolution. Thousands of Red Guard radicals were ushered
into the compound. They rampaged through the houses of suspected
``capitalist roaders'' in the communist leadership, including
China's future leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
   Deng's abject ``self-criticism'' didn't satisfy the Red Guards,
who yelled that he was a ``capitalist despot.'' Deng was evicted
from the compound, kicked out of his party offices and banished to
the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Following Mao's death in 1976, Deng was rehabilitated and came
to power as premier in 1980. But instead of emulating Mao, Deng
preferred to live in his own house outside the walls -- a practice
that many in today's top leadership follow.
</P>
<P>
   Deng was a man of simple tastes,'' author Harrison Salisbury
wrote in 1992. ``Mao had celebrated his emperorship by moving into
Zhongnanhai. Deng Xiaoping celebrated his by moving out.''
</P>
<P>
   Access to Zhongnanhai became less exclusive as the aura of Mao
faded.
</P>
<P>
   By 1987, Chinese tourists could get tickets from their factories
to visit a large part of the compound. They tromped through the
shaded ``Hall of Noble Refinement'' in Mao's quarters and gaped at
the ``Hall of Fragrant Robes,'' where Qing emperors used to change
their clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Zhongnanhai was again closed to Chinese tourists during the 1989
Tiananmen Square uprising. If such visits are currently permitted,
there has been no publicity about it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet these days not just heads of state and celebrity journalists
are invited inside to see the ginkgo trees beside the placid lake.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., and a
12-member congressional delegation were among the compound's
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   China's relations with the U.S. has entered a state of
``sunshine after the rain,'' Jiang said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich was more blunt: ``I told them we will defend Taiwan.
Period,'' Gingrich said. ``The thing that was striking to me is
that we never got into an argument about it.''

 &HT;    HOW SHANGHAI BECAME A CITY OF THE 21ST CENTURY
 &HT;    With CHINA-CLINTON; CHINA-YOUTH-$ADV29.
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service (at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI _ A precis of how Shanghai grew:
</P>
<P>
   1000-1800 A.D. _ Port. Shanghai expands from an obscure village
into a quiet fishing port because of its favorable location 12
miles from the confluence of the Yangtze River and the Pacific
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   1842 _ Concession. After defeating Chinese imperial armies in
the Opium Wars, Britain imposes the Treaty of Nanking. The British
occupy the choicest sector of Shanghai as a mini-colony known as a
``concession.'' The Americans, French and Japanese soon build their
own concessions.
</P>
<P>
   1900-1935 _ Sin. Shanghai is the richest, most elegant and most
decadent city in Asia. Western businessmen and rich Chinese cavort
in 688 brothels, some the size of factories. Opium dens operate
with impunity. An upper crust of Westerners plays billiards in the
Shanghai Club on the waterfront and bets on thoroughbreds at the
Race Club.
</P>
<P>
   July, 1921 _ Stirrings. Shanghai's wretched slums incubate the
Chinese Communist Party. Mao Tse-tung and 12 other representatives
of Communist cells meet over tea in a house off Huaihai Street to
form a national communist party.
</P>
<P>
   1926 _ Protest. Marshal Sun Chuanfang begins a campaign to evict
the British, French, American and other concession-holders from
their Shanghai enclaves. He calls the concessions a ``humiliation''
because they are ``a long-standing reminder of our loss of
sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   1937-1945 _ Decline. Under Japanese occupation, Shanghai
withers. Silt clogs the port and nearby Huangpu River because no
one dredges it for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   May 1949 _ Takeover. Mao's troops march into Shanghai. They
impose steep taxes, destroy some of the worst slums and send off
hundreds of prostitutes known as ``sing-song girls'' for
``re-education.'' The fleeing Nationalist Chinese forces carry off
Bank of China's gold reserves to Taiwan, leaving Shanghai's
treasury empty.
</P>
<P>
   July 1985 _ Rebound. Former English teacher Jiang Zemin, China's
future president, is appointed Shanghai mayor by Beijing communist
authorities. He cultivates a populist image and brings in foreign
investment. Shanghai's economy grows by 110 percent in 1986. Jiang
is promoted to China's Politburo in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   April 1990 _ Takeoff. Ten months after the Tiananmen Square
massacre, Beijing decides to pour massive resources into Shanghai
to turn the city into an ultra-modern high-tech port. A
150-square-mile special zone on the Pudong peninsula is accorded
tax and customs privileges to draw in foreign banks and
manufacturers. Shanghai's economy starts to soar.
</P>
<P>
   Late 1997 _ Bursting. By some estimates, 20 percent of the
world's construction sites are in Shanghai. Five years ago, the
city had one 20-story building. Now it has 966, and dozens more are
under construction.

 &HT;    TIANANMEN SQUARE _ A HALLOWED BAROMETER OF DISSENT
 &HT;    With CHINA-CLINTON; CHINA-COMPOUND-$ADV27.
 &HT;    For Use Saturday, June 27 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service (at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ For eight decades, Tiananmen Square has been the
world's best barometer of protest and repression in China:
</P>
<P>
   May 4, 1919 _ May Fourth Movement. About 3,000 university
students protest the post-World War I Versailles Treaty. They
demand that China be treated as a war victor, having sent 100,000
coolie laborers to support Allied combat troops. (The Allies gave
Germany's worldwide ``sphere of influence'' to Japan, including a
German enclave in China.)
</P>
<P>
   1925 _ Anti-British. Students protest a massacre of Chinese
demonstrators by British troops in the British enclave of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 9, 1935 _ ``December Ninthers.'' Thousands of students
demand a war of national resistance against Japan, which now
controls China's northern Manchuria region and most of Hebei
Province, which rings Beijing. In frigid weather Nationalist
Chinese authorities train water hoses on the demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 1, 1949 _ Communists. Victorious communist guerrilla Mao
Tse-tung stands on the gate to the former imperial city and
declares to a mass rally, ``the Chinese People have now stood up.''
</P>
<P>
   1952-1958 _ Demolition. Mao's construction brigades raze the
outer palace gate of the Forbidden City to enlarge the square to
its present mammoth proportions of 98 acres, making it the world's
largest public square.
</P>
<P>
   August 1966 _ Red Guards. Mao reviews more than one million
``Red Guards,'' who chant slogans of the Cultural Revolution and
hold up copies of ``The Quotations of Chairman Mao.''
</P>
<P>
   April 4-5, 1976 _ Confrontation. Stirred by the death of
revolutionary hero Zhou Enlai, students pay homage to Zhou and also
demand ``genuine'' Marxism-Leninism. A crowd of 100,000 scuffles
with police, burning a few police cars. Authorities jail at least
388 and send many to labor camps for ``counter-revolutionary
sabotage.''
</P>
<P>
   1976-77 _ Mao's Tomb. In 10 months following Mao's death, one
million Chinese ``volunteers'' erect a massive marble mausoleum for
the leader's corpse, which will be mechanically raised from a
freezer inside its crystal coffin, draped in a red flag, for daily
lines of viewers. Mao's waxy corpse is still on display.
</P>
<P>
   November 1978-March 1979 _ ``Democracy Wall.'' On a wall along
the main avenue leading to Tiananmen Square, near the Zhongnanhai
leadership compound, dissidents paste hand-written ``wall
posters.'' One by a disillusioned Red Guard, Wei Jingsheng, calls
for a ``fifth modernization'' in China _ democracy. Wei is
imprisoned, becoming one of China's most prominent dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   January 1987 _ Long Live Freedom. Students hold a mass
``freedom'' rally in defiance of police bans.
</P>
<P>
   April 17, 1989 _ Anti-corruption. Students begin assembling to
mourn the death of revolutionary leader Hu Yaobang, whose ouster
from the party hierarchy had made him a cult hero. Students decry
corruption and nepotism. Authorities hesitate to crack down,
fearing embarrassment prior to a summit visit by Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev. The crowds increase daily.
</P>
<P>
   May 17, 1989 _ Escalation. Student crowds in the square grow to
one million. About 3,000 hunger-strikers set up a tent city,
occupying the square around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   May 20, 1989 _ Failed crackdown. Premier Li Peng declares
martial law, orders troops into Beijing to evict the students. But
masses of city residents clog the streets, bottling up the troops.
</P>
<P>
   May 29, 1989 _ Goddess of Democracy. Art students from Beijing
University erect a 33-foot statue made of plaster and Styrofoam
resembling the Statue of Liberty. Meanwhile, communist rulers worry
about activists in an unauthorized trade union camped out with the
student hunger-strikers.
</P>
<P>
   June 3-4, 1989 _ Massacre. Tanks and motorized troops of the
People's Liberation Army rumble in, forcing out the last 5,000
protesters. Between 500 and 1,000 demonstrators and a few dozen
troops are killed, most in clashes on the boulevards leading to
Tiananmen. Thousands of students, including protest leader Wang
Dan, are arrested; thousands flee into exile through Hong Kong.

 &HT;    RELIGION IN CHINA - TWO MILLENNIA OF COMPETITION
 &HT;    With CHINA-CLINTON; CHINA-RELIGION-$ADV28
 &HT;    For Use Sunday, June 28 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service (at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Here's how China's personality for the last two
millennia has been shaped by religions:
</P>
<P>
   200 B.C.-200 A.D. _ Imperial Confucianism. The human-centered
philosophy of the Chinese thinker Confucius (551-479 BC), who
stressed duty to the state and to ``moral behavior according to
status,'' is adopted by Chinese imperial rulers as a state
religion.
</P>
<P>
   1st Century A.D. _ Buddhism. The teachings of The Buddha, who
probably lived in Nepal in the 7th century B.C., are imported from
India and spread rapidly, eclipsing state Confucianism during the
golden age of Chinese Buddhism in the 5th-9th centuries A.D.
</P>
<P>
   2d-6th Century A.D. _ Daoism. A native mystical philosophy,
rooted in the wise sayings attributed to a Chinese hermit named Lao
Zi, thrives as an alternative to rigid Confucianism. It stresses
contemplation and ``dropping out,'' in contrast to Confucianism's
codes of duty to state and family elders.
</P>
<P>
   8th-9th Centuries A.D. _ Islam. Arabian camel caravans on the
Silk Road introduce the Muslim religion, which takes hold in
present-day Xinjiang province of western China and other ethnic
minority regions.
</P>
<P>
   16th Century A.D. _ Roman Catholicism. Jesuit priests enter
China, reach the imperial Ming Dynasty court and introduce
Christianity among the inner-most elite. Catholic missionaries
begin underground parishes, even though missionary work is
forbidden by the emperors.
</P>
<P>
   1807 _ Protestantism. Nearly 150 years of increasingly open
Christian proselytizing among Chinese begins as the first
Protestant missionary arrives from Britain.
</P>
<P>
   1843 _ Americans arrive. China opens its borders to American
Protestant missionaries, who are allowed to operate churches and
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   1850-64 __ Taiping Rebellion. Firebrand Chinese mystic draws
ethnic minorities and Chinese to his quasi-Christian revolt against
the Qing Dynasty's oppressive domination. British and French forces
help the Qing defeat rebels, who had nearly toppled the empire.
</P>
<P>
   1898-1901 _ Boxer Rebellion. Devotees of folk religion and
martial arts rise up against foreign influences, attacking
Christian missionaries and their converts. A foreign army of 20,000
U.S., British, Russian, Japanese and French troops enters China to
quell the uprising. Western missionary work expands.
</P>
<P>
   1949 _ Communist Suppression. All missionaries are expelled as
Lenin's atheism becomes the state religion. Some Christian churches
are forced to convert into state-controlled ``patriotic'' churches.
The rest are banned.

   1950-1960 _ Tibet Shackled. The People's Liberation Army enters
Tibet and gradually suppresses Tibetan nationalist resistance. The
Tibetan Buddhist leader, the Dalai Lama, escapes to exile in India

   BEIJING _ Sunday evening in the candlelit sanctuary of Dong
Tang, a ``patriotic'' Catholic church, a four-year-old Chinese girl
in a frilly dress sang the memorized words of a hymn with as much
gusto as the adults around her.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 worshipers chanted alleluias, partook holy
communion and heard of miraculous events at the Sermon on the
Mount. Elderly men, young couples, three sweaty teens in baggy
pants -- basketball in tow -- filled two-thirds of the pews last
week.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese-language service looked much like a mass in America.
</P>
<P>
   But the priest could not mention Catholicism's most revered
living figure, Pope John Paul II, or even whisper a reference to an
issue central to the church worldwide: the stand against abortion.
</P>
<P>
   And fortunately for the four-year-old's mother, no hard-line
Chinese authorities were in Dong Tang (East Church) that night
looking for violators of government mandates, because it is
forbidden to spread religion to anyone under 18.
</P>
<P>
   China controls all Christian groups by forcing them to register
as social organizations, regulating what they preach and arresting
or detaining those who cross the government-drawn line of
acceptable religious practice. Both Protestants and Catholics must
be part of China's ``patriotic'' religious movement, which means
they cannot align with a foreign-based church.
</P>
<P>
   These are the kinds of restrictions advocates of human rights
hope President Bill Clinton's visit today to a Beijing Protestant
church will spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic Dong Peiying, 77, saw her religion outlawed and its
sanctuaries desecrated during the Cultural Revolution from
1966-1976. She welcomes any restoration of open religious practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite free for people to worship. There are many people
who believe in religion now. Usually there are no obstacles,'' said
the diminutive white-haired woman leaving the Dong Tang service,
around the corner from Beijing's Forbidden City.
</P>
<P>
   But she sighed when asked about her church's break with the
Vatican, which China's Communist government directed after the 1949
revolution in order to expel foreign influence from a potent social
force.
</P>
<P>
   Will China's Catholics ever return to Rome's fold?
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it is possible. We hope it is possible,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese think tank specialists speak of a possible breakthrough
in informal talks quietly going on between intermediaries for the
Vatican and the Chinese government. To facilitate the reported
compromise, the Vatican would end diplomatic recognition of Taiwan
and take an even trickier step of agreeing Rome would not appoint
archbishops in China.
</P>
<P>
   In back-channel talks in March, a Catholic emissary is said to
have cited as a possible precedent a centuries-old agreement with
French and German monarchs, in which the Vatican reportedly allowed
local authorities to select archbishops.
</P>
<P>
   Even could those conditions be met, the Holy See would face
repeated compromises in reuniting with the Chinese church under
current government controls.
</P>
<P>
   At least four million Chinese Catholics agree with parishioner
Dong that the constraints are not too onerous, and they worship in
the officially-sanctioned church, according to government figures.
Another 10 million Chinese participate in the Protestant churches
registered with the government.
</P>
<P>
   But 30 million or more are estimated to gather in underground
churches in defiance of government regulations, praying in
apartments or caves or fields.
</P>
<P>
   Local enforcement of the national policy is uneven. Some
unregistered churches remain fairly free from harassment, said Nina
Shea, director of the Center for Religious Freedom in Washington,
D.C. Other churches are not.
</P>
<P>
   This is the only underground movement in China. There is no
Solidarity, no samizat press,'' said Shea, referring to the labor
union that brought down Poland's Communist regime and the
underground publications that criticized Soviet life. ``The Chinese
have been terribly efficient in wiping out dissent.''
</P>
<P>
   And dissent, according to Western watchers, is exactly what the
Chinese government fears religion may foster -- especially with
today's increasing unemployment and economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally in China there have been religious sects that have
arisen, especially in the countryside, and gathered a lot of people
and eventually moved to political ends,'' said Brent Fulton,
managing director of the Institute for Chinese Studies at Wheaton
College in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   The most infamous example was the 1850-64 Taiping Rebellion, led
by a charismatic Chinese who declared himself a brother to Jesus,
called by God to save China from the oppression of the Qing
Dynasty's Manchu rulers.
</P>
<P>
   His militant evangelism attracted legions of followers who
mounted civil war and took over much of central China. Only with
the aid of French and British forces did the Manchus finally quell
the uprising.
</P>
<P>
   Today, religion with political overtones particularly is
targeted in Tibet, where authorities suspect the exiled Dalai Lama
wants to return to lead Buddhist followers to independence. Muslim
activists in mountainous Xinjiang Province on the western border
are likewise monitored.
</P>
<P>
   Even in mainstream ethnic Chinese areas, however, deviation from
accepted religious lines spells trouble. From across the country
come reports of religious leaders being arrested or detained,
popular shrines shut down and worship sites trashed.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials maintain the charges of religious persecution,
including those made in the latest U.S. State Department Human
Rights Report, are wrong and even fabricated.
</P>
<P>
   Like the previous reports, they simply pieced together hearsay
and distorted information and used this material as the basis for
their report,'' Ye Xiao Wen, director general of China's Religious
Affairs Bureau said at a news conference in Washington this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese citizens' freedom of religious belief is guaranteed
under the constitution of China,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when three prominent American clergymen toured China this
year to assess the status of religion, a key question concerned the
fate of 30 Chinese religious leaders believed detained for reasons
of faith.
</P>
<P>
   Wheaton College's Fulton, who was in the delegation, said
authorities did not deny religious figures have been imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   They practiced religion outside the official sphere and that's
why they were arrested. The official version is they were causing
trouble or getting into political affairs,'' he said.

   BEIJING _ China's new graduates are a rare tribe -- more
informed, more free, more pampered and more job-pressured than any
generation since the 1949 communist revolution.
</P>
<P>
   They herald a new round of university students unbowed by the
burden of their country's tumultuous recent past, as they take
their turn at molding its future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing for us students is to enrich ourselves. On
one hand to enrich ourselves with knowledge, and on the other to
broaden our visions,'' said Wang Qi, an earnest 22-year-old
graduating from Beijing University, where she majors in Japanese
language studies.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual to find students at Beida, as China's most
prestigious, 100-year-old university is nicknamed, speaking of
heavy personal responsibilities to China's future.
</P>
<P>
   That is, when they aren't mesmerized by the NBA Finals or the
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   At Fudan University in Shanghai, another distinguished school in
a more free-wheeling cosmopolitan setting, senior English major
Shen Yi Ming takes a breezier approach to life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like rolling stones. It's easy to move from job to
job,'' said Shen, 22, a top student who starts working at the Bank
of China this summer. ``Shanghai will be a financial center. I'm
going to play some role in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, no one can say just how this tranche of young Chinese
will progress through careers and family. It is a generation that
has no precedents.
</P>
<P>
   Even at Beida's gated campus -- strictly closed to outsiders
since its students began the 1989 democracy movement that ended in
blood at Tiananmen Square -- the world's ways are breaking through.
Students are hooked on the internet, play the Shanghai stock market
and expect to own an apartment one of these years. Intrigued by
foreign technology and management techniques, they say they have no
time for anybody's political ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them were not even born when the death knell rang in
1976 for Mao Tse-tung, the Chinese leader who twice led into
pandemonium and destruction the country he had revolutionized. They
missed the Cultural Revolution that finally gasped to a full stop
with Mao's death, though their parents were among its most direct
victims.
</P>
<P>
   And they grew up with the late leader Deng Xiaoping's policies
of economic reform and openness. These doctrines they were
spoon-fed in current affairs classes were policies their elders
never envisioned and still may not fully comprehend.
</P>
<P>
   Another impact is China's ``one-child'' policy that began 18
years ago and left many of them sibling-less, the ``Little
Emperors'' whose families count on them both ``to do good and do
well.''
</P>
<P>
   More and more like them will follow; one-third of China's
population is under age 16.
</P>
<P>
   Despite national growth rates hovering around 8 percent a year,
China's young graduates see gathering clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Guo Xueliang, 20, is in a two-year program of politics and
administrative management at Beida that used to feed civil servants
to China's far-flung bureaucracy. Has she been walking the halls of
the ministries looking for work?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no. I have passed the exam of qualification for public
service. But I'm not likely to work for the government,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Guo is holding out for a private company, because the future of
state jobs looks shorter by the week under bureaucratic downsizing
and bankruptcy of unwieldy state industries.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment is everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The official China Daily newspaper reported this month that 80
percent of this year's graduating students have found jobs, which
might be an impressive success rate elsewhere. But this is a
country that used to assign every single graduate to a job.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first year graduating students have been totally
untethered to fend for themselves in the job market. And this
bumper crop of 1.06 million graduates is 17 percent larger than
last year -- the biggest since the People's Republic of China was
founded in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Beida is China's Harvard, Fudan University its Yale. What keeps
these young Chinese optimistic is knowing they are trained for the
new jobs opening up, while the laid-off workers -- often their
parents -- don't have a clue to making it in the high-tech,
high-finance world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of our state-owned enterprises don't pay attention to
management,'' said Chen Feng, 28, an MBA student at Beida. ``So we
are very likely to go to foreign-funded enterprises. In this aspect
foreign enterprises are 100 years ahead of us.''
</P>
<P>
   They may not want to work for the state, but the young people
who will be the cream of Chinese leadership by 2025 are extremely
patriotic. These students, even when interviewed outside the
presence of journalist-watching monitors, professed not to
understand the flap in America over Clinton visiting Tiananmen
Square, the symbol of democracy's crushing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe China is not the same today. Maybe the economy is
different. The economy was partly the cause of the politics (in
1989),'' said Chris Yu, 22, a Fudan student who chose the name
``Chris'' for her new job with the Deloitte Touche accounting firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's more likely for young people today to care more
about their career, their job and making a contribution to their
country,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   They have hard work ahead. Lay-offs and the one-child policy may
make them the sole supporter of their parents before they even
begin their own families. But for now they are still in their final
student days and follow universal student ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aim now is to enjoy life thoroughly,'' said Fudan's
irreverent Shen, ``and have no regrets about university days.''

   VILNIUS, Lithuania _ It is a grim, frightfully intimate job
performed by Juozas Aleksiejunas. He gives guided tours of his
former hell.
</P>
<P>
   The 76-year-old Aleksiejunas escorts visitors around Lithuania's
appallingly well-preserved KGB prison, a lingering monument to the
bleak, brutal days of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt ill when I came back here,'' he said of his first
glimpse of the prison in 1992, almost 50 years after his
incarceration. ``People who left this building after interrogation
here just wanted to see it torn down. But if you tore it down the
evidence would be gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Lithuania, the first of the three small Baltic states which
broke away from the Soviet Union in 1990, looks back with this
unique museum to the KGB, the feared security apparatus which kept
dissidents in check and punished any notion of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   In the heart of its capital, the Lithuanian government has
preserved the brownstone building in all its horrific detail _ from
the suffocating isolation chambers to the barren interrogation
rooms. Now, the prison goes by the name of the Genocide and
Resistance Center.
</P>
<P>
   In one corner is the wholly preserved padded cell where torture
took place, a room well insulated to mask the inmates' agonizing
screams from the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   In another is the ``wet'' cell, where prisoners were stripped
naked and forced to squat for hour after hour on a small metal
platform while frigid water flooded the concrete cell floor beneath
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who were brought here, their cases were already
decided,'' said Aleksiejunas, who began working at the museum as a
volunteer and now receives a small salary to augment his pension.
</P>
<P>
   He was a nationalist partisan fighter in the 1940s who spent
four months in the prison in central Vilnius before being exiled to
Siberia, one of an estimated 350,000 Lithuanians who were
imprisoned and banished by the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   He points to the spot in a gloomy concrete cell where he was
forced to squat for hours under questioning while being beaten.
</P>
<P>
   And then, to emphasize his point, he invites his visitor to
assume the position for only 45 uncomfortable seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Lithuanians are eager to assert their nationality and
their liberty from the Soviet past. They want alliances with the
European Union and with NATO that will remind them and the world
that they are no longer shackled to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is that message stronger than in the dank, dark recesses
of this museum, which preserves the thick stone walls, bare light
bulbs and heavy steel doors of its infamous place in history.
</P>
<P>
   Grainy black-and-white photos display the fighters who did not
survive their stay. Between 1944 and 1947, an estimated 700 people
were executed at the prison, most of them shot in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Such ruthlessness by the KGB diminished the armed resistance but
did not stifle the underground antagonism towards the Soviets. Over
the decades of Soviet rule, a steady stream of patriotic writing
was circulated, some of it on display at the museum.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955 an anonymous writer penned: ``They keep our hearts
pinched as with red-hot pliers and they wash their hands in the
blood of our brothers and sisters. Perhaps this independence day
will free our young hearts when the tricolor (flag) waves.''
</P>
<P>
   Aleksiejunas was a member of Brothers of the Forest, a
resistance group which first fought the Soviets, whose Red Army
occupied Lithuania in 1940, then the Nazis who followed a year
later, and then the Soviets again, who drove the Germans out at the
end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested in 1945, charged under the notorious Soviet
Article 58 -- betrayal of the socialist state. Three years later,
his parents also paid for his resistance activities. They were
deported to Siberia and their family farm in Lithuania was
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was easy to be convicted under Article 58. If you were
chatting with three friends and you were talking about cars,
perhaps you might have said that American cars are better than the
Russian ones. If one of your friends was an informant, you ended up
in jail for treason,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aleksiejunas spent 18 years in various prisons and labor camps,
including Vorkuta, nearly 1,200 miles northeast of Moscow, a link
in the infamous Soviet gulag.
</P>
<P>
   But the jail in Vilnius was among the worst of it, he recalls,
because here he lost many of his friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to keep the memories, to tell people about the
past,'' he said. ``Because without the past there is no future.''

his parents also paid for his resistance activities. They were
deported to Siberia and their family farm in Lithuania was
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was easy to be convicted under Article 58. If you were
chatting with three friends and you were talking about cars,
perhaps you might have said that American cars are better than the
Russian ones. If one of your friends was an informant, you ended up
in jail for treason,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aleksiejunas spent 18 years in various prisons and labor camps,
including Vorkuta, nearly 1,200 miles northeast of Moscow, a link
in the infamous Soviet gulag.
</P>
<P>
   But the jail in Vilnius was among the worst of it, he recalls,
because here he lost many of his friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to keep the memories, to tell people about the
past,'' he said. ``Because without the past there is no future.''

<P>
   Maybe Dr. Dolittle shouldn't have listened this time
</P>
<P>
   By Dave Larsen
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Murphy launched his monumental comeback with a remake of
Jerry Lewis' The Nutty Professor, for which he earned a Golden
Globe best-actor nomination. So it's no surprise that Murphy's next
starring role would be an update of another '60s film.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Dolittle? The original, a 1967 musical-comedy starring
Rex Harrison, was a colossal dud that almost ruined 20th Century
Fox studios.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy's sporadically amusing, non-singing update is a slight
improvement, putting a contemporary spin on Hugh Lofting's stories
about a physician who can talk to the animals. The songs, though,
have been replaced by ``litter box'' humor that's much too crude
for small children, earning the Betty Thomas-directed film a PG-13
rating.
</P>
<P>
   Kids in that age bracket would probably rather see The X-Files
or Armageddon than a bunch of chatty critters. Especially when many
of the animals are obviously animatronic puppets.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dolittle's menagerie of voice actors reads like a ``Comic
Relief'' all-star team: Chris Rock, Norm MacDonald, Albert Brooks,
Garry Shandling, Julie Kavner, John Leguizamo, Ellen DeGeneres,
Jenna Elfman, Gilbert Gottfried and Paul Reubens, to name a few.
All but the first three are woefully under-used. The same might be
said of Murphy, who winds up playing straight man to a sarcastic
dog (MacDonald), a fast-talking guinea pig (Rock) and an ailing
circus tiger (Brooks)..
</P>
<P>
   We meet John Dolittle as a boy, when the family pet (DeGeneres)
explains to him why dogs sniff one another's backsides. When John
tries this method to greet the new principal, his pooch is sent to
the pound by his disapproving father (Ossie Davis). John never
talks to another animal.
</P>
<P>
   Not until adulthood, that is, after Dolittle has become a doctor
with a beautiful wife (Kristen Wilson) and two individualistic
daughters (Kyla Pratt and Raven-Symone). His long-dormant ability
is unleashed when he hits a stray dog, whom he hears call him a
``bonehead.'' Soon, wounded and sick animals are flocking to
Dolittle's door, jeopardizing an impending buyout of his medical
practice, and calling his sanity into question.
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay opts for too many butt jokes, rather than fully
exploiting the comedic potential of the cast or storyline.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dolittle does have heart, however, and is somewhat redeemed
by a cute ending and a litter of one-liners.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy needs to talk to his agent and tell him no more lame
remakes.

<P>
   A steadicam follows Brendan Fraser and Alicia Silverstone
through the lobby of a Holiday Inn in Hollywood, past the check-in
desk, past a frosted glass mural of Marilyn Monroe, through
faux-grand doors and outside, where the passing traffic hisses and
wheezes on Highland Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The two keep up a steady patter as they go, Fraser gesturing
wildly, like a silent-movie clown.
</P>
<P>
   They're shooting a comedy called ``The Blast from the Past,''
with Fraser playing Adam, a young man who'd been raised in an
elaborate underground bomb shelter since the 1962 Cuban missile
crisis by a paranoid scientist father, Christopher Walken, and
mother, Sissy Spacek _ ``June Allyson on Listerine,'' Fraser calls
her.
</P>
<P>
   Now in the 1990s, in spite of its hydroponic garden and fish
tank, the family is running out of supplies. Adam emerges to seek
batteries, toilet paper _ and a girl.
</P>
<P>
   And here he is, not the psychopath one would expect after a
childhood like this, but a clean-cut, rather starchy fellow with
early-'60s values and impeccable manners.
</P>
<P>
   He develops an instant crush on tough cookie Silverstone, whom
he meets while trying to cash in a l950s Joe DiMaggio baseball
card.
</P>
<P>
   Silverstone, all sausage curls and trademark petulance, is
complaining to Adam about her lack of a boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never works out, because I'm into butts and legs and hair
myself, so I always end up with some guy who's more shallow than I
am.''
</P>
<P>
   No boyfriend? Adam goes into hormonally induced paroxysms of
glee.
</P>
<P>
   Cut. Do it again. And again. And again, as extras playing
Scandinavian tourists mingle with genuine British travelers,
bemused and jet-lagged as they stagger off a bus and wander into a
Hollywood movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brendan was born to play this part,'' says writer-director
Hugh Wilson, a pleasant-faced man in chinos. ``It's all about
innocence, and Brendan exudes innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   It's true that Fraser's furrowed brow always manages to give him
a rather sweet air of faint bewilderment, which he used to comic
advantage in ``George of the Jungle'' and which made him touchingly
vulnerable in ``School Ties,'' the l991 movie about teen-age
anti-Semitism that gave him his big-screen break.
</P>
<P>
   But at 6 feet 3 inches, the 29-year-old Fraser is also a great
lunk of a guy. During a lull in filming, he's settled into a
nondescript armchair, his oversized feet planted firmly on the
carpet in a suite on the 22nd floor of the location hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Against a decorating nightmare of lurid flowered curtains and
fake floral arrangements that could have time-warped out of the
movie, Fraser is talking up a storm, hands flying in all directions
to punctuate his points.
</P>
<P>
   He's usually called shy, a description that makes him balk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm thoughtful,'' he says. ``And I'm told I have
infrared vision. I like to understand people before I present
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, he adds, he likes to save himself for his performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many comedians won't say boo to you, but put them in front
of a microphone and they blister the wallpaper.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what he did to the screen in ``George of the Jungle,''
last summer's surprise hit with kids and critics alike.
</P>
<P>
   A $100 million-plus box-office gross put the movie on Daily
Variety's Golden Reel list of top moneymakers for 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``So hoo ha for the business end of the things,'' says Fraser,
whose price tag jumped from $1 million for ``George'' to several
million. He also gained a new audience of 7-year-olds, who laughed
at earnest George, and their mothers and baby-sitters, who gulped
at the sight of his well-toned muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wardrobe was about the size of a tea-towel,'' says Fraser,
who began a mad weight-lifting routine when he got the part.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it never really seemed like enough,'' he says about his
physique, which he considered nothing more than part of his George
costume. ``I'm glad they took a picture of it, because it sure
doesn't stay that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Fraser has gotten used to things not staying the same for long.
His father traveled the world promoting Canadian tourism, and the
family went along. The youngest of four brothers, Fraser lived in
Britain, the United States, Canada and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, he was introduced to the Buster Keaton movies that he
draws on now for comic roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's immense dignity in playing a clown. We're
asked to do everything no one else wants to do, only with
panache,'' he says, perhaps remembering his title role in ``Encino
Man'' _ his other loincloth movie _ in which, as a prehistoric man
unfrozen after millions of years, he shared a dish of dog food with
a Labrador retriever.
</P>
<P>
   Life on the move may also have had something to do with Fraser's
becoming an actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It influenced me at an early age to be open to different
people,'' he says. ``Or to invent them, or beg, borrow or steal
from them, and pretend they were mine all along.''
</P>
<P>
   The actor's first brush with theater came in an unlikely
setting: the Upper Canada College in Toronto, a New World
incarnation of a British public school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't paddled, but we were definitely tested again and
again,'' he remembers. ``We were little businessmen in our suits.
We weren't making money, but we were making marks. That was our
income. I can attest to that: All the old boys have gone on to the
Canadian equivalent of Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   He, on the other hand, discovered the small campus theater _ not
as a budding actor, but by stage-managing and selling tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the bug had bitten. After a stint at the Actor's
Conservatory at Seattle's Cornish College of the Arts, he was on
his way to grad school in Texas when he stopped in Los Angeles to
make money.
</P>
<P>
   He never left. And just a year later, he landed the coveted lead
in ``School Ties,'' an ensemble movie in which he co-starred with
Matt Damon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was wonderful. The same guy you see today,'' Fraser says of
Damon. ``He wasn't trying to make himself look good to charm an
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Fraser glances through the hotel window at a grim-looking urban
vista obscured by gray mist, and recalls his first reaction to Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt distanced from it,'' he says. ``As I look out right
now, I can't say I recognize this view, because it's always
changing every time I turn around _ if you can see it through the
thick air.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then again,'' he continues, ``there's that kind of misty
quality that makes for great black-and-white photography.''
</P>
<P>
   Fraser, who collects old Polaroid cameras, describes himself as
``a spectacular amateur'' photographer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He takes his cameras everywhere. Takes them to dinner. Maybe
hides behind them. I don't know,'' says director Wilson, who
invited Fraser to his Virginia farm to get acquainted before the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson has five children and notes that Fraser, possibly out of
shyness, spent more time playing with the kids than talking to him.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Fraser remembers arriving at the farm after
surviving a combination of back-slapping and ``jealous glares'' at
his Upper Canada College 10th-year reunion.
</P>
<P>
   He'd flown from Toronto into Washington D.C., and the studio
sent a stretch limo to pick him up. He arrived to find Wilson, in
raincoat and hat, waiting for him atop a John Deere tractor.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Fraser lives in Hollywood with girlfriend Afton
Smith, a former actress he describes as ``dreamy.'' They plan to
marry and live somewhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a homebody,'' he says _ dashing the fantasies of a slew of
prepubescent girls and their mothers. ``I've discovered things like
fleece-lined doeskin slippers. Given that and a choice between a
cocktail party ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm drawn to what I don't have,'' he concludes.
</P>
<P>
   What he has very little of, apparently, is free time. With the
success of ``George'' and his newly perceived image as Hollywood
hunk, Fraser is on a hot streak, finding more scripts coming his
way than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Still Breathing,'' which came out in April, he was a
longhaired innocent again, this time a San Antonio street performer
in search of the true love he's envisioned in a dream.
</P>
<P>
   He was also recently in Morocco, shooting a techno-version of
the 1939 ``The Mummy,'' and in the upcoming ``Gods and Monsters,''
he stars as the fictional boyfriend of a movie director played by
Ian McKellen.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the innocence of some of the characters he plays,
the actor himself looks at it all with a faintly jaundiced eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times this is a Restoration comedy,'' he says about
Hollywood. ``We're seeking favor in court. There are jealousies and
rivalries. It's a play.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he adds, ``the meaning of `play,' is fun.''

   A steadicam follows Brendan Fraser and Alicia Silverstone
through the lobby of a Holiday Inn in Hollywood, past the check-in
desk, past a frosted glass mural of Marilyn Monroe, through
faux-grand doors and outside, where the passing traffic hisses and
wheezes on Highland Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The two keep up a steady patter as they go, Fraser gesturing
wildly, like a silent-movie clown.
</P>
<P>
   They're shooting a comedy called ``The Blast from the Past,''
with Fraser playing Adam, a young man who'd been raised in an
elaborate underground bomb shelter since the 1962 Cuban missile
crisis by a paranoid scientist father, Christopher Walken, and
mother, Sissy Spacek _ ``June Allyson on Listerine,'' Fraser calls
her.
</P>
<P>
   Now in the 1990s, in spite of its hydroponic garden and fish
tank, the family is running out of supplies. Adam emerges to seek
batteries, toilet paper _ and a girl.
</P>
<P>
   And here he is, not the psychopath one would expect after a
childhood like this, but a clean-cut, rather starchy fellow with
early-'60s values and impeccable manners.
</P>
<P>
   He develops an instant crush on tough cookie Silverstone, whom
he meets while trying to cash in a l950s Joe DiMaggio baseball
card.
</P>
<P>
   Silverstone, all sausage curls and trademark petulance, is
complaining to Adam about her lack of a boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never works out, because I'm into butts and legs and hair
myself, so I always end up with some guy who's more shallow than I
am.''
</P>
<P>
   No boyfriend? Adam goes into hormonally induced paroxysms of
glee.
</P>
<P>
   Cut. Do it again. And again. And again, as extras playing
Scandinavian tourists mingle with genuine British travelers,
bemused and jet-lagged as they stagger off a bus and wander into a
Hollywood movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brendan was born to play this part,'' says writer-director
Hugh Wilson, a pleasant-faced man in chinos. ``It's all about
innocence, and Brendan exudes innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   It's true that Fraser's furrowed brow always manages to give him
a rather sweet air of faint bewilderment, which he used to comic
advantage in ``George of the Jungle'' and which made him touchingly
vulnerable in ``School Ties,'' the l991 movie about teen-age
anti-Semitism that gave him his big-screen break.
</P>
<P>
   But at 6 feet 3 inches, the 29-year-old Fraser is also a great
lunk of a guy. During a lull in filming, he's settled into a
nondescript armchair, his oversized feet planted firmly on the
carpet in a suite on the 22nd floor of the location hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Against a decorating nightmare of lurid flowered curtains and
fake floral arrangements that could have time-warped out of the
movie, Fraser is talking up a storm, hands flying in all directions
to punctuate his points.
</P>
<P>
   He's usually called shy, a description that makes him balk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm thoughtful,'' he says. ``And I'm told I have
infrared vision. I like to understand people before I present
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, he adds, he likes to save himself for his performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many comedians won't say boo to you, but put them in front
of a microphone and they blister the wallpaper.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what he did to the screen in ``George of the Jungle,''
last summer's surprise hit with kids and critics alike.
</P>
<P>
   A $100 million-plus box-office gross put the movie on Daily
Variety's Golden Reel list of top moneymakers for 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``So hoo ha for the business end of the things,'' says Fraser,
whose price tag jumped from $1 million for ``George'' to several
million. He also gained a new audience of 7-year-olds, who laughed
at earnest George, and their mothers and baby-sitters, who gulped
at the sight of his well-toned muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wardrobe was about the size of a tea-towel,'' says Fraser,
who began a mad weight-lifting routine when he got the part.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it never really seemed like enough,'' he says about his
physique, which he considered nothing more than part of his George
costume. ``I'm glad they took a picture of it, because it sure
doesn't stay that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Fraser has gotten used to things not staying the same for long.
His father traveled the world promoting Canadian tourism, and the
family went along. The youngest of four brothers, Fraser lived in
Britain, the United States, Canada and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, he was introduced to the Buster Keaton movies that he
draws on now for comic roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's immense dignity in playing a clown. We're
asked to do everything no one else wants to do, only with
panache,'' he says, perhaps remembering his title role in ``Encino
Man'' _ his other loincloth movie _ in which, as a prehistoric man
unfrozen after millions of years, he shared a dish of dog food with
a Labrador retriever.
</P>
<P>
   Life on the move may also have had something to do with Fraser's
becoming an actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It influenced me at an early age to be open to different
people,'' he says. ``Or to invent them, or beg, borrow or steal
from them, and pretend they were mine all along.''
</P>
<P>
   The actor's first brush with theater came in an unlikely
setting: the Upper Canada College in Toronto, a New World
incarnation of a British public school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't paddled, but we were definitely tested again and
again,'' he remembers. ``We were little businessmen in our suits.
We weren't making money, but we were making marks. That was our
income. I can attest to that: All the old boys have gone on to the
Canadian equivalent of Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   He, on the other hand, discovered the small campus theater _ not
as a budding actor, but by stage-managing and selling tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the bug had bitten. After a stint at the Actor's
Conservatory at Seattle's Cornish College of the Arts, he was on
his way to grad school in Texas when he stopped in Los Angeles to
make money.
</P>
<P>
   He never left. And just a year later, he landed the coveted lead
in ``School Ties,'' an ensemble movie in which he co-starred with
Matt Damon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was wonderful. The same guy you see today,'' Fraser says of
Damon. ``He wasn't trying to make himself look good to charm an
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Fraser glances through the hotel window at a grim-looking urban
vista obscured by gray mist, and recalls his first reaction to Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt distanced from it,'' he says. ``As I look out right
now, I can't say I recognize this view, because it's always
changing every time I turn around _ if you can see it through the
thick air.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then again,'' he continues, ``there's that kind of misty
quality that makes for great black-and-white photography.''
</P>
<P>
   Fraser, who collects old Polaroid cameras, describes himself as
``a spectacular amateur'' photographer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He takes his cameras everywhere. Takes them to dinner. Maybe
hides behind them. I don't know,'' says director Wilson, who
invited Fraser to his Virginia farm to get acquainted before the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson has five children and notes that Fraser, possibly out of
shyness, spent more time playing with the kids than talking to him.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Fraser remembers arriving at the farm after
surviving a combination of back-slapping and ``jealous glares'' at
his Upper Canada College 10th-year reunion.
</P>
<P>
   He'd flown from Toronto into Washington D.C., and the studio
sent a stretch limo to pick him up. He arrived to find Wilson, in
raincoat and hat, waiting for him atop a John Deere tractor.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Fraser lives in Hollywood with girlfriend Afton
Smith, a former actress he describes as ``dreamy.'' They plan to
marry and live somewhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a homebody,'' he says _ dashing the fantasies of a slew of
prepubescent girls and their mothers. ``I've discovered things like
fleece-lined doeskin slippers. Given that and a choice between a
cocktail party ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm drawn to what I don't have,'' he concludes.
</P>
<P>
   What he has very little of, apparently, is free time. With the
success of ``George'' and his newly perceived image as Hollywood
hunk, Fraser is on a hot streak, finding more scripts coming his
way than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Still Breathing,'' which came out in April, he was a
longhaired innocent again, this time a San Antonio street performer
in search of the true love he's envisioned in a dream.
</P>
<P>
   He was also recently in Morocco, shooting a techno-version of
the 1939 ``The Mummy,'' and in the upcoming ``Gods and Monsters,''
he stars as the fictional boyfriend of a movie director played by
Ian McKellen.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the innocence of some of the characters he plays,
the actor himself looks at it all with a faintly jaundiced eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times this is a Restoration comedy,'' he says about
Hollywood. ``We're seeking favor in court. There are jealousies and
rivalries. It's a play.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he adds, ``the meaning of `play,' is fun.''

 &HT;    Neglected spinster weaves web of revenge
 &HT;    By Gary Schwan
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sculptor Auguste Rodin caused a stink when he unveiled his
phallic statue of the 19th century French novelist Honore de
Balzac. Behind the statue _ or in front of it, you could say _ is
the idea that sex and artistic creativity are somehow synonymous.
</P>
<P>
   This quaint notion took root with the Picassos and Hemingways of
the early 20th century and endures among Hollywood filmmakers of
our era.
</P>
<P>
   Balzac was prodigious _ creatively, at least. His aim was to
document every aspect of the confusing period before the Revolution
of 1848. He did so with a ferocious energy, knocking out book after
book filled with insecure aristocrats, avaricious bankers,
ambitious courtesans, wan artistes _ and in his novel ``Cousin
Bette,'' one very vengeful spinster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Human Comedy'' is the title of Balzac's massive collected
works. ``Cousin Bette'' is now a film starring Jessica Lange, and
it takes the ``comedy'' bit very seriously. As for the ``human'' _
well, the characters tend to be made of cardboard.
</P>
<P>
   But the real problem for this black comedy is a mixed, confusing
tone. Part melodrama, part farce, the strains merge awkwardly when
they come together at all.
</P>
<P>
   Balzac was a master of witty irony. Noted theater director Des
McAnuff, in his feature film debut, has a feel for the ridiculous.
But if it weren't for the subtle Jessica Lange as Cousin Bette, the
film would have missed the irony altogether, not to mention the
poignancy.
</P>
<P>
   Bette is a spinster wronged once too often by her dingbat family
of newly minted aristocrats who are living uneasily off the glories
of the Napoleonic era. Sometimes inadvertently, she gains her
revenge through actions that are invisible to the dopes around her.
</P>
<P>
   Bette is the poor relation of the Hulot clan. When her cousin
(Geraldine Chaplin) dies, she expects to become the lady of the
Hulot household. But the self-absorbed widower Hector Hulot (Hugh
Laurie) ignores her hopes for romance, instead offering her a job
tending to the needs of his pretty daughter Hortense (Kelly
Macdonald).
</P>
<P>
   Bette declines and moves to a poor quarter of Paris. There she
becomes a costumer for the cabaret songbird Jenny Cadine (Elizabeth
Shue), and falls for the young bohemian sculptor Wenceslaus (Aden
Young).
</P>
<P>
   But when love and life pass her by again, Bette begins to subtly
manipulate all of these characters. The Hulots never know what hit
them, although it's an intriguing question whether revenge is
really sweet for Bette since it's a bit by-the-way and ultimately
empty.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some bad casting and an inconsistent tone, the film has
enjoyable moments, thanks largely to Lange. She proves that you
don't have to be a vixen to be vindictive. Doing her best to look
dowdy, Lange proves the master of The Stare. Indeed, she stares so
hard and meaningfully that, at times, she seems cross-eyed. But she
also adds gravity to a film in constant danger of slopping over
into Monty Pythonism.
</P>
<P>
   Shue is horribly miscast as a theatrical thrush; Laurie, a
wonderfully goofy comedian, is just a tad too silly as Hulot; Young
is a tiresome caricature of a bohemian artist; and Bob Hoskins
should have lost the wig as the banker Crevel.
</P>
<P>
   For every scene that captures your attention, there's one that
seems simply wrong _ an absurd duel, for example, and the
inevitable sex scenes, including a bout of chocolate-covered
love-making that will put you off the procreative act for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   When it avoids the absurd, ``Cousin Bette'' is fun, as only rude
justice, cleverly obtained, can be. But the film is far too
farcical for its own good.
</P>
<P>
   --ENDIT--

<P>
   There was a time when Michael Bailey, an expert in computer
graphics development, toed the party line: He told people that a
two-dimensional image of an object on a computer screen could
convey as much detail and enlightenment as the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   But over the past few years he's become something of a heretic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I have to tell those people that I was wrong,'' he says.
``It's embarrassing, but graphics are just not as good as having an
object to touch and hold.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey has rediscovered a need that we all, as babies,
instinctively recognized. When babies see something new, they
immediately want to explore it with their tiny fingers. It's the
way they acquire a solid working knowledge of the physical world.
</P>
<P>
   Now a growing number of scientists are discovering, along with
Bailey, that a picture just won't do for their purposes, either.
</P>
<P>
   Objects large and small can be represented with physical models
_ and these are Bailey's new passion.
</P>
<P>
   Walk into his office at the San Diego Supercomputer Center and
you can't help noticing them littering his desk. Most have the
color, heft and polished softness of carved wood. His collection
includes a human heart, fist-size molecules and a strangely
flattened jack-o'-lantern.
</P>
<P>
   They look like solid wood, but all were crafted from paper and
glue.
</P>
<P>
   The sculptor was a copy machine-size device called the Helisys
1015 Laminated Object Manufacturing Rapid Prototyping System _ or
LOM.
</P>
<P>
   The LOM is the star of the center's Tele-Manufacturing Facility,
which Bailey runs.
</P>
<P>
   (The LOM, a computer in Bailey's office and a link to the
Internet constitute the entire Tele-Manufacturing Facility.)
</P>
<P>
   The Tele-Manufacturing Facility represents the latest chapter in
the decade-long history of the attempt to turn computer graphics
into solid models _ a process known as rapid prototyping.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've found that even before you pick up the model and touch
it, you've already gathered more information than if you just
looked at it on a flat computer screen,'' Bailey says. ``We're
trying to figure out why, but my hunch is that it has something to
do with the way your eye can vary its focus on a solid model.''
</P>
<P>
   For John Johnson, a structural biologist at the Scripps Research
Institute, a LOM-created model of a protein turned out to be a
revelation.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson studies the black beetle virus, a simple pathogen that
infects insects, so that he can better understand more complex
viruses that plague humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Viruses have the same problems to solve whether they are HIV
or insect viruses,'' Johnson explains, ``and this one is very easy
to work with because it has only two genes.''
</P>
<P>
   After 15 years of careful work, Johnson thought that he and his
colleagues completely understood the black beetle virus. They knew,
for example, that 180 identical copies of one protein linked
together to form the virus' geodesic dome-shaped outer capsule,
they knew how those links were forged and they could program a
computer to show it.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Johnson handed his data over to Bailey, who then built
nine copies of the protein, each 20 million times actual size. When
Johnson got his hands on the protein models, he assembled three
into a clump, just as they assemble themselves in nature.
</P>
<P>
   Then, turning the proteins over in his hands, Johnson saw a hole
where the three molecules met. In all his years of studying the
proteins, this hole had eluded him. Computer graphics couldn't give
him enough sense of depth to notice it.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Johnson saw the hole in the model, he recognized that
it was a perfect fit for a peglike protrusion on another surface of
the three-protein chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an alignment just like you would align things if you
were fitting together pieces of wood,'' Johnson says, ``and we
hadn't realized it. We didn't even know we had missed it. Now it is
possible to design small molecules that can fit into that hole and
block the assembly of the virus.''
</P>
<P>
   LOM begins building an object by creating the bottom-most layer.
Paper fed off a roll is glued to a metal platform inside the LOM,
and a carbon-dioxide laser then traces an outline on the paper.
</P>
<P>
   Any paper lying outside the outline then gets crosshatched by
the laser, and the metal platform drops down a fraction of an inch.
</P>
<P>
   Another section of paper is then rolled out on top of the first
layer, and as they are heated to 400 degrees, the two layers fuse.
The laser now cuts a new outline for the second layer.
</P>
<P>
   The machine repeats this process hundreds or thousands of times,
and when the last layer has been rolled and cut, Bailey can pay the
model off the platform with a putty knife.
</P>
<P>
   The model is a solid block, but the crosshatched areas
surrounding the object fall away easily. The smaller pieces wedged
into cracks and crevices can be fished out with tools that look
like dental picks.
</P>
<P>
   The process can take anywhere from a few hours, for simple
models like the human heart in Bailey's office, to more than a day
for complicated molecules like the black beetle virus protein.
</P>
<P>
   Because the scorched edges of the paper form the exterior
surfaces of the parts, the finished product has the appearance of
aged wood, which can be accentuated by a coat of lacquer.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of Dru Clark, a graduate student at the University
of California at San Diego, Bailey has created hundreds of models.
Some are exotic: topographical maps of the seafloor and Venus, a
swirling hurricane. Others are traditional manufacturing models,
like gears and aircraft parts.
</P>
<P>
   The data for building these models generally come to Bailey's
office over the Internet. Before a model can be built, though, the
data must be translated into a geometric representation of the
object's surface _ a mesh of as many as 600,000 tiny triangles.
</P>
<P>
   The translation isn't always smooth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that the computer graphics on the screen
doesn't care about solidity,'` Bailey says ``You can do all kinds
of things with graphics and the computer will happily draw it up
because you are simply modeling appearance.''
</P>
<P>
   But you can build only those physical objects that can exist in
three dimensions. There here are mathematical rules that must be
followed. If a gap is hiding in the data, for example, it can
become a crack in the model.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a crack, the machine can get confused about what
is inside and what is outside,'' Bailey says. ``For instance, if I
drew a circle on a piece of paper and asked you what was inside,
well, that's easy. But what if I drew an arc? What is inside? I
don't know. It could be the area on the bottom of the line, or it
could be the area on top.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey has built a program that will let his computer
automatically check data for these sort of errors, with the
ultimate goal of making the LOM produce finished models without his
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   These subtleties of turning strings of ones and zeros into a
piece of sculpture are pretty much lost on the researchers who send
Bailey their data files, but he doesn't mind their indifference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scientists don't want to know, they just want the model.
They are only interested in the science,'' Bailey says. ``And that
is the purpose of the project _ scientists don't have to be
mathematicians or engineers.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   For 139 years, ever since its delicate bones and feathers were
found splayed on a limestone slab in a German quarry, Archaeopteryx
has had the distinction of being the most primitive bird known.
</P>
<P>
   Its clawed wings, toothy beak and long bony tail, most
paleontologists now believe, show the transformation of a lineage
of bipedal dinosaurs into birds.
</P>
<P>
   Since its discovery, the 145-million-year-old Archaeopteryx has
perched alone on a low branch of the avian evolutionary tree.
</P>
<P>
   Now the old bird finally has company. In March, paleontologists
described a 65- to 70-million-year-old bird from Madagascar, which,
though younger than Archaeopteryx, is almost as primitive. In life
it would have resembled a little winged Velociraptor.
</P>
<P>
   Paleontologists found the fossil in a quarry in northwestern
Madagascar.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Sampson of New York College of Osteopathic Medicine in Old
Westbury, N.Y., came across a wing bone embedded in rock.
Suspecting that more of the skeleton might be hidden in the rock,
he dug around the bone and shipped a yard-long block to the State
University of New York at Stony Brook, where the fossils could be
carefully extracted.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the wing bone, the researchers thought they had a
relatively ordinary bird (it even had nodes on one edge where
feathers were once lodged) _ until they uncovered the tail. Modern
birds have a stub to anchor a fan of feathers; the Madagascar bird
had a bony tail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just looked really primitive,'' says Catherine Forster of
Stony Brook. ``I remember a preparator was working on the foot, and
I joked that wouldn't it be funny if the foot had a big sickle
claw?''
</P>
<P>
   She was remembering that in the 1970s John Ostrom of Yale had
suggested that birds were closely related to dromaeosaurs,
predatory dinosaurs with giant sickle claws on their feet. This
group included dinosaurs such as Deinonychus and Velociraptor,
which probably disemboweled prey with their claws.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Archaeopteryx had evolved, most paleontologists
assumed, this weapon had dwindled to an ordinary bird claw.
</P>
<P>
   After she made her joke, Forster left the lab to teach an
anatomy class. Half an hour later a colleague called from the lab
to tell her that the bird did indeed have an inch-long sickle claw.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers recovered part of the bird's tail and spine, the
pelvis, much of its legs, parts of its arms and a shoulder blade.
</P>
<P>
   To determine its closest relatives, Forster compared it with
seven birds and eight dinosaurs, using a computer to calculate the
simplest evolutionary pattern that could produce their anatomic
similarities.
</P>
<P>
   Her analysis showed that the Madagascar bird was nearly as
primitive as Archaeopteryx, possibly located on the same side
branch of bird evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Forster and her colleagues have named the bird Rahonavis
ostromi.
</P>
<P>
   ```Rahona' is a Malagasy word,'' Forster says, ``with a double
meaning: 'cloud' and 'menace.' We thought it was a good name for a
flying killer.''
</P>
<P>
   Forster also honored Ostrom with the name because the fossil
further supports the bird-dinosaur connection.
</P>
<P>
   Although most paleontologists subscribe to Ostrom's ideas today,
there are critics. Some argue that dinosaurs lost their fourth and
fifth fingers while birds are missing their first and fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Still others have looked at dinosaur fossils found recently in
China and have argued that they had crocodile-like lungs radically
unlike those of birds.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to Forster and others, the many primitive bird and birdlike
dinosaur fossils found recently in Spain, China and Argentina
bolster Ostrom's theory.
</P>
<P>
   Rahonavis, Forster says, is a particularly strong link in the
chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a primitive bird, it looks almost exactly like
Archaeopteryx, and it has a dromaeosaur foot, which is a pretty
clear link to its dinosaur origins.''

<P>
   For 139 years, ever since its delicate bones and feathers were
found splayed on a limestone slab in a German quarry, Archaeopteryx
has had the distinction of being the most primitive bird known.
</P>
<P>
   Its clawed wings, toothy beak and long bony tail, most
paleontologists now believe, show the transformation of a lineage
of bipedal dinosaurs into birds.
</P>
<P>
   Since its discovery, the 145-million-year-old Archaeopteryx has
perched alone on a low branch of the avian evolutionary tree.
</P>
<P>
   Now the old bird finally has company. In March, paleontologists
described a 65- to 70-million-year-old bird from Madagascar, which,
though younger than Archaeopteryx, is almost as primitive. In life
it would have resembled a little winged Velociraptor.
</P>
<P>
   Paleontologists found the fossil in a quarry in northwestern
Madagascar.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Sampson of New York College of Osteopathic Medicine in Old
Westbury, N.Y., came across a wing bone embedded in rock.
Suspecting that more of the skeleton might be hidden in the rock,
he dug around the bone and shipped a yard-long block to the State
University of New York at Stony Brook, where the fossils could be
carefully extracted.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the wing bone, the researchers thought they had a
relatively ordinary bird (it even had nodes on one edge where
feathers were once lodged) _ until they uncovered the tail. Modern
birds have a stub to anchor a fan of feathers; the Madagascar bird
had a bony tail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just looked really primitive,'' says Catherine Forster of
Stony Brook. ``I remember a preparator was working on the foot, and
I joked that wouldn't it be funny if the foot had a big sickle
claw?''
</P>
<P>
   She was remembering that in the 1970s John Ostrom of Yale had
suggested that birds were closely related to dromaeosaurs,
predatory dinosaurs with giant sickle claws on their feet. This
group included dinosaurs such as Deinonychus and Velociraptor,
which probably disemboweled prey with their claws.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Archaeopteryx had evolved, most paleontologists
assumed, this weapon had dwindled to an ordinary bird claw.
</P>
<P>
   After she made her joke, Forster left the lab to teach an
anatomy class. Half an hour later a colleague called from the lab
to tell her that the bird did indeed have an inch-long sickle claw.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers recovered part of the bird's tail and spine, the
pelvis, much of its legs, parts of its arms and a shoulder blade.
</P>
<P>
   To determine its closest relatives, Forster compared it with
seven birds and eight dinosaurs, using a computer to calculate the
simplest evolutionary pattern that could produce their anatomic
similarities.
</P>
<P>
   Her analysis showed that the Madagascar bird was nearly as
primitive as Archaeopteryx, possibly located on the same side
branch of bird evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Forster and her colleagues have named the bird Rahonavis
ostromi.
</P>
<P>
   ```Rahona' is a Malagasy word,'' Forster says, ``with a double
meaning: 'cloud' and 'menace.' We thought it was a good name for a
flying killer.''
</P>
<P>
   Forster also honored Ostrom with the name because the fossil
further supports the bird-dinosaur connection.
</P>
<P>
   Although most paleontologists subscribe to Ostrom's ideas today,
there are critics. Some argue that dinosaurs lost their fourth and
fifth fingers while birds are missing their first and fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Still others have looked at dinosaur fossils found recently in
China and have argued that they had crocodile-like lungs radically
unlike those of birds.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to Forster and others, the many primitive bird and birdlike
dinosaur fossils found recently in Spain, China and Argentina
bolster Ostrom's theory.
</P>
<P>
   Rahonavis, Forster says, is a particularly strong link in the
chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a primitive bird, it looks almost exactly like
Archaeopteryx, and it has a dromaeosaur foot, which is a pretty
clear link to its dinosaur origins.''

 &HT;    ``Diary'' truly a delicious, frothy farce
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY, by Helen Fielding. Viking; 271 pages;
$22.95.
</P>
<P>
   All is not well in Bridget Jones' England. Her mother is
sleeping, not with Bridget's father, but with a newly acquired
Portuguese lover. Her friend Jeremy is sleeping with a terrible
slut. Prince Charles is sleeping with Camilla Parker-Bowles. Worst
of all, Bridget is sleeping with a man who only shows up when every
other woman has turned him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bridget Jones's Diary'' was last year's must-read in England
and is being touted as this summer's must-read here. It began as a
weekly newspaper feature and seems ready-made for a movie. It's a
year in the life of a 30-something girl mired in mid-level
publishing, whose biological clock is resounding like Big Ben.
</P>
<P>
   Unattached and loathing every minute of it, she especially
bridles at impertinent questions from family and friends about her
love life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why can't married people understand that this is no longer a
polite question to ask? We wouldn't rush up to them and roar,
`How's your marriage going? Still having sex?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Each of the novel's daily entries is preceded by Bridget's
careful notations of her weight, the number of cigarettes she's
smoked, the units of alcohol she's drunk.
</P>
<P>
   Bridget wishes she was a literary figure like Kathleen Tynan,
who radiated poise and could be found writing at a small, bare
table in the center of a room, sipping an exquisitely chilled glass
of white wine.
</P>
<P>
   Bridget, on the other hand, is given to white whine. In spite of
her good intentions, it's a daily struggle to just muddle through.
Dignified hauteur is quite beyond her.
</P>
<P>
   When she notices the tell-tale signs of early aging _ creases
around the eyes, etc. _ she decides to go for a more upscale look.
Elizabeth Hurley seems to be the goal. She ends up looking like
Barbara Cartland.
</P>
<P>
   Bridget has an extended family of friends, including Tom, Jude,
Shazzer and Magda, all of whom she adores, relies on emotionally,
and, behind their backs, slags mercilessly. They undoubtedly return
the favor, for they're as adorably confused as she is.
</P>
<P>
   Bridget's friend Magda, a former commodities broker, goes into
an earth-mother kick when she gets pregnant, only to lose her nerve
and begin shrieking, ``Give me the drugs, you fat cow!'' as soon as
her water breaks.
</P>
<P>
   The plot, such as it is, relates to Bridget's giddy mother,
whose affair with the Portuguese has devastated her husband even as
it has liberated her. Once a nominal housewife, she lands a job as
an inquiring reporter for the BBC on issues relating to
osteoporosis. In other words, Mum's doing better than Bridget, and
Bridget isn't happy about it.
</P>
<P>
   This ratchets up the anxiety level, and Bridget flings herself
desperately from pillar to post, from ecstasy to oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bridget Jones's Diary'' is largely delicious, frothy farce,
the sort of stylized romp the English do so well.
</P>
<P>
   It's also frankly derivative; Bridget is really the compulsive,
desperate and doomed Basil Fawlty with a sex-change, set loose in
the boozy, upscale, gloriously irresponsible world of ``Absolutely
Fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that Basil, Patsy and Edina had only the
prospect of more chaos in front of them; Helen Fielding gives
Bridget a highly unlikely, not to mention retro, happy ending.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I suspect Fielding has captured a moment in time here,
and not just in England _ Bridget is a perfect representation of a
modern girl/woman flummoxed by time and change, vacillating between
what she really wants and what she thinks she should want, aspiring
to be mistress of the universe when she can't quite manage to
untangle her pantyhose.

 &HT;    Look who's talking to the animals: Eddie Murphy!
 &HT;    By Charles Passy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Old comics don't die. They just become kiddie fare.
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be the best way to describe Eddie Murphy's career
these days. After a decade of mostly forgettable movies _ did
anyone actually see ``Beverly Hills Cop III''? _ the former
``Saturday Night Live'' star has resurfaced in a couple of fine
children's films. First, he was the wise-cracking voice of the
dragon in ``Mulan'' and now he's the eponymous hero of a remake of
``Dr. Dolittle.''
</P>
<P>
   Forget any memories you have of a dry-as-sherry Rex Harrison in
the 1967 original. With lots of help from some furry friends,
Murphy turns the 1998 ``Dr. Dolittle'' into a bust-a-gut delight
that will appeal to kids and adults alike.
</P>
<P>
   It's a performance that overlooks plenty of faults in Nat
Mauldin and Larry Levin's script (based upon Hugh Lofting's classic
stories) and Betty Thomas' direction. It's a performance that even
overlooks Murphy's weaknesses as a dramatic actor.
</P>
<P>
   But when you witness the spectacle of Murphy giving
mouth-to-mouth to a dying rat and then proclaiming upon the
rodent's recovery, ``It was just gas,'' you've got your money's
worth.
</P>
<P>
   In this updated ``Dr. Dolittle,'' Murphy is a successful San
Francisco physician who is considering selling his practice to a
managed-care firm and who is guiding his youngest daughter (played
by a charming Kyla Pratt) through a nerdy stage of childhood. These
troubles serve as a catalyst for what Dolittle's friends and family
mistake as a nervous breakdown. But Dolittle ain't nuts: He's just
talking to the animals.
</P>
<P>
   And what animals they are: In addition to the rat with gas,
we've got a dog with an attitude, a guinea pig who takes a dip in a
toilet bowl, a pigeon who fantasizes he's a bluejay and a tiger
who's contemplating suicide. Once the word is out that Dolittle's
the man who can hear them, they all find their way to his door.
Literally.
</P>
<P>
   When Murphy is interacting with the animals, ``Dr. Dolittle'' is
at its strongest. Murphy's timing and mannerisms reveal his natural
comic instincts, the script sizzles with lots of good gags and
Thomas plays each scene for its hilarious worth. Add to that the
cast of celebrity voices _ Norm Macdonald, Chris Rock, Albert
Brooks, Garry Shandling, Julie Kavner and Ellen DeGeneres, among
others _ and you have a smart concept movie a la ``Look Who's
Talking.'' Only funnier.
</P>
<P>
   Then, about midway through, everyone starts to worry that the
gags aren't enough; the script gets bogged down with too many
unlikely scenarios and the need to project a statement. We're led
to believe that the reason Dolittle must talk to the animals is the
same reason his daughter must continue on her nerdy trajectory _
it's all about being who you are. The self-important tone doesn't
suit Murphy, nor does Thomas find a way to deliver the message
without the film lapsing into sentimentality.
</P>
<P>
   But remember the rodent with gas. There's nothing like a little
bathroom humor to bring out the kid in all of us.

 &HT;    Untested water storage plan is Florida's best hope for
protecting Everglades
 &HT;    By Joel Engelhardt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The federal plan to save the Everglades
depends on the untested practice of storing up to 1.7 billion
gallons of water underground every day during wet years and pulling
it back up during dry times.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that it's never been done before on such a massive
scale.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that federal regulators at the highest levels are
agonizing over the idea of injecting untreated _ and possibly
tainted _ lake water into underground drinking sources.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the alternatives are not well-defined, could
cost millions or even billions more and would fill at least 100,000
acres with water ringed by levees 112 miles long.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' plan for the Everglades relies
on the approach known as Aquifer Storage and Recovery, or ASR,
because of its promise.
</P>
<P>
   The system could be a savior of the 21st century, reducing the
need for reservoirs that turn valuable farmland into swamps while
replacing a brackish layer of ground water with enough fresh
watercq to meet the demands of Florida's fast-growing population.
</P>
<P>
   It has so much promise, it should be attempted on a scale five
times as large as planners envision, said a Gainesville consultant
who has shepherded such projects in Florida since the procedure's
infancy in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fear is that without ASR the cost will be so high it would
take us a long time, maybe decades, to solve the problems,'' said
David Pyne, ASR director for CH2MHillcq. That engineering firm has
worked on all five underground storage projects operating in
Florida and about half of the 30 in planning or construction
stages.
</P>
<P>
   Yet critics say the approach is so uncertain it should be
consigned to backup status. The plan's reliance on the underground
storage system to meet the demands of people while water from other
sources flows into the Everglades is too extreme, said Gary
Dernlan, who manages the Palm Beach County water and sewer system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to take a stance to restore everything and forget
the 5 million people who are here. We don't feel that's the best
route to go,'' Dernlan said.
</P>
<P>
   For the water managers crafting the plan, the answer is in the
middle, a cautious approach that doesn't rely entirely on the
underground storage system but still makes it a significant factor.
They are rushing to create backup plans if the system doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
   The most pressing concern is whether they would have to treat
the water before injecting it underground.
</P>
<P>
   Planners estimate that building 200 underground storage wells
around Lake Okeechobee will cost $600 million. But if the water
must be treated first, it would cost nearly another $1 billion,
making the ASR system as expensive as other storage options, if the
water must be treated first.
</P>
<P>
   The science involves digging a hole more than 1,000 feet deep to
reach the brackish Floridan aquifer. The injected water pushes
aside the brackish water, creating a bubble of fresh water that
eventually can be pulled out and pumped through canals to treatment
plants.
</P>
<P>
   The only question is whether the water will still be there years
later.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, water managers have worked to persuade the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency to let them send untreated water
into the aquifer. The EPA refused, worried about the presence of
coliform bacteria in the injected water. But at a meeting last
week6/9/98, EPA official Richard Harvey said the agency would allow
untreated water to be injected as long as it met other
water-quality standards.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came from EPA Secretary Carol Browner, Harvey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure that our legacy down here is not that we
allow the ground water to be trashed,'' Harvey said. ``The only
reason we're willing to consider this is because of the potential
economic benefits for the whole South Florida system.''
</P>
<P>
   By summer, an underground storage project in the city of West
Palm Beach may get the nation's first permit to inject untreated
water.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is promising, water managers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``This plan is beginning to look like it will be an A-plus with
ASR and maybe a B-minus without it,'' South Florida Water
Management District Chairman Frank ``Sonny'' Williamson said at an
April 15 meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Or as Palm Beach County environmentalist Rosa Durando put it:
``ASR is really our only hope. If it doesn't pan out we're dead.''

 &HT;    ``Biggest environmental restoration ever'' draws fire from
Florida sceptics
 &HT;    By Robert P. King
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A half-century ago, weary from an
unending cycle of flood, drought and fire, South Florida residents
asked Washington to build them a barrier against the extremes of
nature.
</P>
<P>
   It worked. All too well.
</P>
<P>
   Federal engineers constructed a 1,600-mile-long bulwark of
canals, levees, pumps and floodgates to ensure that people would
always have enough water _ but never too much. That let the
region's farms prosper. Suburbs and strip malls swarmed, faster
than anyone had imagined, toward the gravel-covered dikes that
marked the Everglades' new boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond those walls, the Everglades strangled in its man-made
straitjacket.
</P>
<P>
   Now the engineers say it's time to start over. They want to
redesign the entire drainage system.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists call it the Everglades' last chance.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers and water managers say it will cost more than $7.5
billion, making it the biggest environmental restoration ever. The
project would spend decades restoring the Everglades' life-giving
pulses of water. The engineers say it's also needed to serve a
region whose population is expected to more than double during the
next 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   It will mean transforming the landscape once again, creating a
network of reservoirs occupying enough territory for a good-size
city. Imagine water covering eight Miamis or two Philadelphias.
Water managers will use so-far-untested methods to store hundreds
of billions of gallons more than 1,000 feet underground, hoping to
retrieve the water years later.
</P>
<P>
   It likely will mean higher taxes or water bills. No one has
decided how to divide the costs, although Washington is expected to
pay half.
</P>
<P>
   All this can happen only if Congress OKs the proposal sometime
after mid-1999. But first, the plan's creators have to sell it to
the people of South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water
Management District say their plan wouldn't just rescue the
Everglades. They say it's also the key to making South and Central
Florida livable for the next half-century as its population doubles
to 12 million.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, residents can expect more frequent water shortages,
greater floods and repeats of this winter's pounding of the St.
Lucie and Indian rivers by Lake Okeechobee's overflow.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a cost to doing nothing,'' said Stuart Appelbaum, the
corps' restoration chief in Jacksonville. ``These problems won't go
away. They'll get worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet parts of the plan have drawn skeptics.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar growers say it would cripple their industry to give up
tens of thousands of acres of productive farmland for some of the
reservoirs. Water utilities fear relying on unproven storage wells
that might not be able to get federal permits.
</P>
<P>
   Even environmentalists, eager to see the long-promised
restoration become reality, want assurances that this time the
Everglades will come first.
</P>
<P>
   This is more than the old fight between environmentalists and
sugar growers. Everyone has a stake in this debate _ even
suburbanites who wouldn't know saw grass from crab grass. A more
natural Everglades
</P>
<P>
   In corps-speak, the plan is the Central and Southern Florida
Restudy, ordered by Congress in 1992. It's the update of the 1947
federal blueprint that led to the creation of today's South
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   That project, which the corps built largely in the 1950s and
'60s, began by erecting a 100-mile-long wall to separate the
Everglades from the populated coast.
</P>
<P>
   To provide a reliable water supply, the corps divided what
remained of the central and northern Everglades into a series of
bathtub-like basins. The engineers straightened the Kissimmee
River, widened drainage canals and created the 700,000-acre
Everglades Agricultural Area.
</P>
<P>
   The new proposal would leave that structure largely intact. But
it would overlay it with a complex web of pumps, canals, dikes,
100-foot-deep underground ``curtain'' walls, well fields and every
conceivable type of reservoir, from shallow marshes to steep pits
left over from rock mining.
</P>
<P>
   The main idea is to find new places to store water until it's
needed _ especially the estimated 600 billion gallons that drain
unused into the sea each year.
</P>
<P>
   The cities and farms would get all the water they need, with
plenty left over for the Everglades, engineers say.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, the Everglades could return to natural
cycles, no longer dependent on humans' leftover water. The corps'
advisers say the plan would help birds, crocodiles, deer and fish.
</P>
<P>
   The plan rests on a paradox: Man-made dikes and pumps have
trashed the Everglades. To rescue it, the engineers would add more.
</P>
<P>
   That has worried some scientists and environmentalists, who said
the plan could amount to a $7.5 billion water supply project that
helps the Everglades only slightly. They have pressed the corps to
be more aggressive in dismantling canals and dikes to restore the
features that the Everglades' plants and wildlife need: the wide
stretches of slow-trickling water with a mix of shallow and deep
marshes.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone can agree on what's natural.
</P>
<P>
   When the engineers looked at removing part of the levee around
the Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge,
scientists there objected. They said the Palm Beach County refuge
would dry out if the levee didn't hold the water inside.
</P>
<P>
   In the plan, the levee stays.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the latest version of the plan, unveiled last week, would
remove 228 miles of canals and levees, including most of the Miami
Canal and the entire east-west levee that runs north of Everglades
National Park along Tamiami Trail. The corps would add bridges or
culverts to the road to let water flow south into the park.
</P>
<P>
   Appelbaum calls truly natural flow an impossible goal for an
Everglades that has lost half its territory to development.
</P>
<P>
   Park researcher Robert Doren agreed but said the current plan
goes further toward that goal than any earlier proposal. He said he
still questions whether the plan would restore enough water to the
heart of the park, but the rest of the proposal seems likely to
help the environment a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're never going to get back the way the Everglades used to
be,'' Doren said, noting that early explorers found the marsh so
wet that they could ride sailboats from hammock to hammock. ``It's
not that way today, and it will probably never be that way again.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal's supporters say scientists don't know enough about
how much water, at what places, at what times, will do the most
good _ at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to learn a lot as we implement this plan over the
next 20 years,'' said Dan Cary, the water district's planning
director. ``What I want is the most tools in the toolbox.''
</P>
<P>
   Another possible sticking point is the project's price.
Florida's half of the $7.5 billion cost would be more than the
water district could handle by itself so some mix of state, county
and local money would be needed.
</P>
<P>
   The corps and district have given too little thought to the
price tag, argued Palm Beach County Utilities Director Gary
Dernlan, although he said he supports the project and thinks it
will work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing they can do is price themselves out of the
market,'' Dernlan said. ``Then the project goes down the tubes, and
everyone loses.''
</P>
<P>
   But Florida Audubon Society lobbyist Charles Lee said the price,
paid out over decades and helping more than 12 million people,
isn't that expensive compared with other big-budget projects. He
cited the estimated $4 billion cost for expanding Miami
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're really talking about is a couple of airport runways
or an expressway somewhere,'' he said. Fooling with nature
</P>
<P>
   The proposal follows a century-old tradition of carving up South
Florida to fit the prevailing ideas of progress.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1800s, when most saw the Everglades as a
vermin-ridden swamp in need of draining, a Philadelphia millionaire
named Hamilton Disston(cq) dug a canal linking the Caloosahatchee
River to Lake Okeechobee.
</P>
<P>
   By 1917, his successors had dynamited riverbeds and scraped four
major drainage canals from the lake to the east coast. Later they
linked the lake to the St. Lucie River, still another outlet for
Okeechobee's excess.
</P>
<P>
   But those primitive efforts backfired in the 1940s, when fires
raged across the dried Everglades, and salt from the ocean invaded
the canals and coastal wells. Then two hurricanes and a tropical
storm struck in the fall of 1947, spreading a blanket of water
across 4,700 square miles from Kissimmee to Florida Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Things got dangerous quickly.
</P>
<P>
   In the farming towns around Lake Okeechobee, schoolboys and
prisoners packed sandbags atop canal dikes. In Canal Point, a dike
collapsed, and 4 feet of water flooded the community.
</P>
<P>
   In West Palm Beach, health officials evacuated 400 families from
their homes in neighborhoods where flood waters mixed with sewage.
Loxahatchee Slough sloshed across Okeechobee Road (cq) when a dike
just west of Military Trail gave way.
</P>
<P>
   It was enough to make a cow cry. Or so the state implied in its
official plea to Congress, which bore a drawing of a cow bawling
its eyes out as water rose to its neck.
</P>
<P>
   The corps had a drainage plan ready, and public sentiment was in
no mood to wait.
</P>
<P>
   On July 1, 1948, the day after President Harry Truman signed the
bill giving the go-ahead, the front page of The Palm Beach Post
carried a cartoon of a big equipment crane labeled ``Flood
Control.'' The man at the controls was shouting, ``Let's go!''
</P>
<P>
   For the Everglades, the results were deadly.
</P>
<P>
   Canals offered a conduit to foreign plants and fish while drying
out vast stretches of saw-grass marsh, allowing melaleuca trees to
invade. Other areas have drowned in too much water, causing
island-dwelling trees to wilt. The levees destroyed the fringe
marshes that give wading birds a place to feed.
</P>
<P>
   Water often arrives at the wrong time, scattering the prey of
nesting wood storks and other wading birds. In a cruel ritual, baby
birds routinely starve to death when rising water forces their
parents to flee.
</P>
<P>
   Little surprise, then, that the Everglades' wading bird
population has declined about 90 percent since the corps began its
work.
</P>
<P>
   North of the Everglades, the drainage system failed miserably
this year as El Nio-driven rains filled Lake Okeechobee and sprang
leaks in the Herbert Hoover Dike. The corps released billions of
gallons of lake water down the St. Lucie Canal, devastating fish,
sea grass and tourism-based businesses downstream.
</P>
<P>
   No such misgivings seemed to matter 50 years ago, said Johnny
Jones, retired former chairman of the Florida Wildlife Federation.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they could think of in those days was how do you get rid
of all that damn water,'' said Jones, who used to hunt ducks near
where the Palm Beach Mall was later built. ``It was simply land
reclamation.'' What's next
</P>
<P>
   The corps and the district plan to revise their proposal during
the summer, then unveil it to the public in mid-October. After
holding public hearings in November, they'll ship a final version
to Congress in July 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Even congressional approval won't end the story. The engineers
and water managers would spend the next 20 years or so designing
each step of the project and lining up the money. What they have
now, the district's Cary said, is ``just a skeleton.''
</P>
<P>
   But parts of the project already are under way. Aided by $200
million from Congress, the corps and district have bought tens of
thousands of acres for future reservoirs south of Lake Okeechobee
and along the Everglades' fringes.
</P>
<P>
   The land will be crucial. In a flat region like Florida, most
above-ground reservoirs have to be shallow _ which means they have
to be broad. Water managers are in a race to buy the land,
especially just east of the Everglades, before developers snatch it
up.
</P>
<P>
   Some think it's too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the coast there's nothing left,'' said Herb Zebuth, a
coordinator for the state Department of Environmental Protection,
who thinks the plan calls for too little storage. ``What are you
going to do in downtown West Palm Beach? Are you going to tear up
all the streets, replace the buildings with treatment areas?''
</P>
<P>
   Questions remain, but supporters say the plan represents a great
leap forward. Twenty-five years ago, most politicians called even
the idea of Everglades restoration a pipe dream, and engineers and
water managers relied on piecemeal fixes that created their own
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember, even as recently as the '80s, really becoming
discouraged at how unwilling, how unprepared we were to take a
big-picture look,'' said John Ogden, a water district biologist and
Everglades expert.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all turned around just remarkably.''

 &HT;    No fireworks for a dry Florida Fourth
 &HT;    By Ron Hayes
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Celebrate your liberty this Fourth of
July by setting off a bottle rocket anywhere in Palm Beach County
and you might wind up under arrest.
</P>
<P>
   But only if a law enforcement officer actually sees you light
the fuse.
</P>
<P>
   While county officials were trying to decide how best to enforce
their ban on private fireworks, Gov. Lawton Chiles prepared to
cancel all public displays as well.
</P>
<P>
   In Tallahassee, Chiles said the lack of any forecast for
sustained rainfall could lead him to ban all municipal Fourth of
July fireworks displays.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not something that we look forward to doing,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach Gardens has already canceled its $15,000 Fourth of
July fireworks display on The Gardens mall property because of the
fire danger.
</P>
<P>
   The site north of the mall _ the only one that could accommodate
the 20,000 to 30,000 people who attend the annual event _ has brush
and woods, and firefighters put out a small brush fire there
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach County officials acknowledged they're largely
depending on voluntary compliance to not set off fireworks to
reduce the threat of brush fires.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a statewide state of emergency,'' warned county Fire
Marshal Jim Sweat, ``and we're hoping people will pitch in just
like they did after Hurricane Andrew. People said hurricanes can't
happen here. We've had 150 brush fires in June, and it can happen
here, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The emergency resolution, signed Tuesday by County Commission
Chairman Burt Aaronson, restricts until Aug. 6 the use of all
fireworks, sparklers and open burning to people or groups with a
government permit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will fully enforce this resolution and make arrests when
necessary,'' said sheriff's Capt. Ed Bieluch, ``but the violation
must occur in the presence of officers.''
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, Bieluch said, violators will be given a notice to
appear, unless they're drunk or belligerent. Juveniles will be
turned over to their parents, and officers will confiscate any
fireworks in plain view.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really hoping our 1 million-plus sensible and
law-abiding citizens will recognize the severity of the
situation,'' Bieluch said.
</P>
<P>
   Three deputies are working solely on illegal fireworks sales and
use, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the county, police responded to the ban with varying
degrees of urgency.
</P>
<P>
   West Palm Beach police also will issue notices, spokeswoman Dena
Peterson said. ``But our best advice is for people to police
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In Palm Beach Gardens and Jupiter, officers will have the option
of issuing warnings instead of notices.
</P>
<P>
   ``If kids are doing it, it would probably be a warning,'' said
Gardens police chief Jim Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   Greenacres will have two extra officers on duty July 4 from noon
to midnight to watch out for bootleg fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   While setting off fireworks is banned, buying them isn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been exceptionally quiet,'' said Ronald Hunnewell, owner
of Galaxy Fireworks at Boca Rio Road and Florida's Turnpike.``We
anticipate we're going to have about a 50 percent drop in business
from last year, but we'll have a better picture after the
weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   In court, Circuit Judge Edward Fine heard a request by Hunnewell
for an injunction to bar the county from enforcing its new vendor
ordinance, which requires vendors to post a $15,000 bond, check
photo IDs, take down names and addresses of anyone who buys
fireworks and note the exemption in the law that allows them to
make the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Hunnewell claims the county's new rules violate state and
federal laws that permit fireworks sales.
</P>
<P>
   Ira Schwartz, manager of Phantom Fireworks in West Palm Beach _
a year-round fireworks business _ said the county's ban on the use
of fireworks already has decreased his customer traffic. It will
only get worse, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very devastating blow to our business,'' he said.
``This is our Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz's employees tried to go about business as usual,
stopping people as they came through the door and asking them to
fill out the affidavits and show a driver license or other forms of
identification.
</P>
<P>
   But as far as John Lewis and his 10-year-old son Devon are
concerned, they're lighting up on July 4 _ ban or no ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Fourth of July, you should be allowed to have
fireworks,'' Lewis said. ``I know I'm going to do it. I think the
ban will be pretty tough to enforce.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Farkas, manning a Forest Hill Boulevard fireworks tent,
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are more tempted to do stuff that's illegal,'' said
Farkas, who by early afternoon had sold fireworks to about six
people. ``It's like telling a little kid not to do something, and
then it just makes them more determined to do it. And this is the
kind of thing you can get away with.''

 &HT;    Pumping at SWT springs criticized
 &HT;    By Rebeca Rodriguez
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN MARCOS, Texas _ As Central Texas continues to swelter under
a merciless June sun and water becomes an ever-more-precious
resource, a 6-inch-wide pipeline behind a popular seafood
restaurant is creating watery battle lines in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The pipeline, the water that will run through it and Joe's Crab
Shack restaurant are owned by Southwest Texas State University. The
pipeline will carry water from San Marcos Springs directly to
university chilling plants that run the air-conditioning systems
around campus. The springs _ locally referred to as Spring Lake _
are on the 90-acre grounds of the old Aquarena Springs theme park
east of the university campus. The university paid $7 million for
the park and rights to the spring water four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The lake, former home to Ralph the Swimming Pig, has become a
stage for ongoing debates over water rights. Local environmental
groups say the pipeline is an example of ivory tower administrators
putting corporate concerns above the delicate ecosystem in the
region. The university says pumping from the lake will reduce the
school's direct draw on the aquifer and free up water for other
users.
</P>
<P>
   Construction of the pipeline comes at an especially sensitive
time, as temperatures around the state inch up and aquifer levels
steadily drop. Statewide burning bans have been in place for weeks,
and the City of San Marcos has issued Stage I water restrictions,
which ban lawn watering during the day. Within days, the city is
likely to impose the second level of restrictions, which allow
once-a-week lawn watering and restrict restaurants to serving water
only when customers ask for it. Because the university is a state
institution, it does not have to abide by the water restrictions,
although it does try to be sensitive to them, said William Nance,
vice president for finance and support services.
</P>
<P>
   Pipeline construction on the banks of the San Marcos River will
last only through the end of the month, and the university has put
up signs to keep the community informed.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not good enough for some.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very distressed about the Spring Lake pumping. It is a
wrong thing to be doing at a time when the aquifer is getting lower
and lower,'' said Dianne Wassenich, president of the San Marcos
River Foundation, a nonprofit organization that works to preserve
and beautify the river. ``The very web of life that we all depend
on is based on those rivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Aquifer levels are dropping at the rate of almost a foot a day,
said Tammy Valentine, a spokeswoman for the Edwards Aquifer
Authority in San Antonio. The elevation Wednesday was 642.2 feet
above sea level. Regional Stage II measures take effect whenthe
aquifer drops to 642 feet, which Valentine estimated will be this
week.
</P>
<P>
   The aquifer is the sole source of water for SWT, as well as many
Central and South Texas cities, including San Antonio and San
Marcos. About 1.5 million Texans rely on the aquifer for water
either directly or through another water source fed by the aquifer.
</P>
<P>
   San Marcos plans to begin drawing surface water from Canyon Lake
within a year, a move that will ease its demand on aquifer
reserves. University officials say the new pipeline will achieve
the same effect by using aquifer water that has already bubbled to
the surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the water gets into Spring Lake, it is going to end up in
the Gulf of Mexico,'' Nance said. By taking it from the surface of
the springs, Nance said, the university will not have to pump as
much water out of the aquifer itself.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Nance said, the amount of water to bepumped to the
university will be only 1/1,000 of the average annual flow from the
springs. ``It's bizarre to think that will drastically affect river
levels,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That argument rings hollow for Wassenich, who said the
university has not considered how its actions could affect San
Marcos and other cities downstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``This story goes all the way to the coast,'' she said, ``but
this Spring Lake problem is a showy one because it's right at the
head of the river.''
</P>
<P>
   The springs feed into the San Marcos River, which eventually
enters the Guadalupe River as it wends southeast to the Gulf.

 &HT;    ``Land Girls'': World War II homefront hokum
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not all women who joined the work force in World War II became
Rosie the Riveter. Instead of heading into factories, some plucky
lasses volunteered to farm, as the well-meaning but mawkish movie
``The Land Girls'' illustrates. It should have been about women in
detergent plants, because it quickly degenerates into a soap opera.
</P>
<P>
   There's an interesting true drama to be told in the stories of
those English maidens who joined the Women's Land Army, but
apparently screenwriter-director David Leland (``Wish You Were
Here'') didn't want to tell it. Instead, he was content to make a
sentimental, randy ``Masterpiece Theatre'' episode about three
women conveniently drawn from different social classes, thrown
together by the hardships of wartime.
</P>
<P>
   With most men off in combat, they are left to fight over a
farmer's shy son, as if the movie were the mirror image of a joke
some traveling salesman would tell.
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers, there's Stella (Catherine McCormick), a banker's
daughter engaged to a navy officer, there's Ag (Rachel Weisz), a
Cambridge ivory tower academic, and there's Prue (Anna Friel), a
down-to-earth, earthy hairdresser. ``The Land Girls'' celebrates
how they adjust to the rural life _ or don't _ and how they put
aside their differences of background and breeding _ or don't _ for
the war effort.
</P>
<P>
   Although it would have been far less explicit, you can imagine a
film like ``Land Girls'' being made right after the war. It's an
old-fashioned women's picture that is harder to accept from a '90s
perspective, though it is based on Angela Huth's 1994 novel.
</P>
<P>
   Rejected for service in the Air Force is Joe (Steven
Mackintosh), the handsome son of the farm owner, whom the three
Land Girls quickly set their sights upon. Prue simply seduces him,
though she also decides he should relieve Ag of her cumbersome
virginity. Stella, however, takes an instant dislike to Joe, which
is a cliched set-up for the serious romance that follows. War
effort or not, Joe soon doesn't have much time for plowing the
fields, for he has his work cut out for him in the hayloft.
</P>
<P>
   The three attractive women compete with the Dorset countryside
for visual attention. They win that skirmish but are frequently
defeated by some of the overripe dialogue they have to deliver. The
picture looks good, with a lot of care taken over period details.
Ultimately, though, the work of the Women's Land Army gets
trivialized, as Leland's script reduces the characters and their
actions into formula hokum.

 &HT;    Bizarre and funny, ``Opposite'' attracts
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Caution: Those who want to like and trust the characters they
watch are going to have a lot of trouble with Dedee Truitt. She's a
precocious, mean-spirited 16-year-old who narrates ``The Opposite
of Sex,'' describing the trouble she stirs up and leaves in her
wake. She's unrepentant bad news, manipulative and trashy, a
refreshingly different comic springboard for a cross-country road
picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a heart of gold, and I'm not going to get one,''
declares Dedee (a snide Christina Ricci), playing with our
expectations earned from so many more conventional movie comedies.
We quickly understand, as she desecrates the casket of her
stepfather at his funeral and then leaves her Louisiana home to
live with her homosexual half-brother Bill (Martin Donovan), a
Midwest schoolteacher.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, she is seducing Bill's lover Matt, convincing him
he impregnated her, running away together to California with money
they stole from Bill and the ashes of Bill's former lover. Did I
mention that Dedee is pure trouble? And that that's the only thing
about her that is pure?
</P>
<P>
   So Bill, suspended from his job because of accusations of sexual
abuse from a jealous ex-student, heads westward in pursuit. He is
accompanied by teaching colleague Lucia (``Friends''' Lisa Kudrow),
the angry, repressed sister of Bill's ex-lover, who pines for Bill
to notice her romantically. Also on the trail is a droopy-eyed
sheriff (Lyle Lovett, showing no signs of learning to act) and
Randy, a Southern twerp with a genital abnormality who happens to
be the real father of Dedee's baby.
</P>
<P>
   Add a little water, stir vigorously, and you've got the makings
of a modern day screwball comedy. Writer-director Don Roos (whose
scripts range from ``Boys on the Side'' to ``Love Field'') keeps
juggling these diverse, ditsy elements and keeps coming up with
deliciously deadpan dialogue for Dedee. Among his merry devices is
having her narration mess with the audience's minds, as she lies to
us, sees how far she can go, then erases what we've just been shown
and returns _ briefly and reluctantly _ to the truth.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of this satirical stew, there are also some pointed
observations about gays, homophobia, sexually active teens and
abortion. While it is easy to feel superior to these wayward souls,
``The Opposite of Sex'' keeps landing rabbit punches of
recognition. And when we see the lengths to which these characters
go because of sex, we can certainly understand why Dedee concludes
that she wants the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   This is a far cry from ``The Addams Family'' for Ricci, who
gives the movie a poisonous spark and is sorely missed when not
onscreen. Between this and her chilling performance in ``The Ice
Storm,'' she has truly made that treacherous transition from child
star to adult actress. Also eye-opening is Kudrow, who _ for the
first time, it seems _ does not fall back on her dumb blonde
shtick. The rest of the cast _ except for Lovett _ is on target
too, which suggests Roos works well with actors or he's got great
instincts for casting.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Roos is a filmmaker to keep an eye on. And Dedee
Truitt is a character worthy of a sequel.

 &HT;    Prison gangs linked to crime beyond walls
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ For members of the Texas prison gang La Raza Unida, the
typewritten words govern life and death. Especially death.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are ordered to carry out a hit, you must do it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way out . . . except by death.''
</P>
<P>
   Those two rules, among 30 that make up the group's constitution,
are much like ones in written dictums governing Texas' other prison
gangs and, authorities say, the growing web of murder and mayhem
that those groups are spreading across Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, a Senate committee is scheduled to open a hearing in the
Senate chambers into whether the activities of those gangs _ both
inside and outside of prison _ have helped turn Texas' corrections
system into an incubator for racism and organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing was scheduled before the recent racially motivated
dragging death of a black man in Jasper, a crime which
investigators say was committed by white ex-convicts who were
suspected of racist-gang affiliations while they were in a Texas
prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drug trafficking, weapons smuggling, murder _ they're into it
all,'' said Sammy Buentello, chief expert on prison gangs for the
Texas Department of Criminal Justice. ``I don't think there's a
large city in Texas that hasn't experienced violence related to
these prison groups. It is a real and growing problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, prison officials said, investigators believe two recent
murders in Austin may have been ordered by one prison gang.
</P>
<P>
   ``These new gangs have shown themselves to be extremely
organized in comparison to their predecessors as well as being more
ruthless, cold-hearted and loyal to their group,'' states a recent
law enforcement memo highlighting the growing danger the gangs
pose.
</P>
<P>
   At present, Buentello said, there are seven organized gangs and
several smaller groups inside Texas prisons with about 4,900
confirmed members _ less than 4 percent of Texas' 142,000 convicts,
but far more than the 400 which prison officials had identified 12
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Still more convicts claim membership in smaller groups or
cliques, prison officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Aides for state Sen. Royce West, the Dallas Democrat who chairs
the committee, said it plans to scrutinize whether a state law may
be helping spread the influence of prison gangs by requiring that
convicts be paroled back to the county where they were convicted
and whether anti-gang programs are hitting the mark.
</P>
<P>
   All of the major gangs have written constitutions, officials
said, ranging from a single page to three or four pages. They
establish rules for friendship, the leadership hierarchy and ways
to settle disputes between members.
</P>
<P>
   ``No fighting between carnales (members). Settle your conflict
or (you) will have to settle it with knives and one of you must
die,'' read the Raza Unida constitution, a copy of which was seized
by authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Most gangs maintain segregated memberships. Buentello and other
prison officials say that has been the case for 20 years, since
gangs emerged in Texas prisons _ ironically, a byproduct of
court-ordered changes in prison operations that desegregated
housing and allowed convicts inside prisons to freely write to one
another.
</P>
<P>
   The desegregation triggered racial and ethnic tensions inside
prisons and, as weaker convicts sought protection from predators,
they formed groups _ almost always along racial or ethnic lines.
Black groups such as the Mandingo Warriors and Self Defense Family
were at odds with the white Aryan Brotherhood and Texas Mafia,
which warred with the Hispanic-membered Mexican Mafia and Texas
Syndicate.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble reached a peak in the mid-1980s, Buentello said, when a
wave of gang-related violence in just one year left more than four
dozen convicts murdered inside prisons _ and thousands of
non-lethal attacks on other convicts and guards.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six years, with the explosion of the prison
population and arrival of young gang members, prison officials
began isolating confirmed gang members in solitary confinement. But
letters to family and friends and a surreptitious network of
communication inside prisons have allowed the gangs to continue
expanding their influence and criminal activity, officials said.

 &HT;    Prison gangs linked to crime beyond walls

<P>
   AUSTIN _ For members of the Texas prison gang La Raza Unida, the
typewritten words govern life and death. Especially death.

</P>

 &HT;    Frankly, ``Wind'' still a tour-de-force
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back on theater screens for the first time since 1989, ``Gone
With the Wind'' looks good, sounds good and remains an almost
completely absorbing experience.
</P>
<P>
   What animates this great melodramatic war horse of the movies,
beyond the splendor of the romantic setting, and what keeps it
continually interesting for nearly all of its 222 minutes is the
struggle for supremacy between two strong-willed, egocentric,
thoroughly selfish adults.
</P>
<P>
   The battle between Scarlett and Rhett involves property, status,
money, power and sex. Basically, she's a manipulative bitch, and
he's a bastard. But _ and this is no small thing _ he loves her. In
their self-absorption and lack of pieties, they're a startlingly
modern couple.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at it for the first time in nearly 10 years, two things
struck me about the film itself as opposed to its presentation
(more on that in a minute).
</P>
<P>
   First, the amazingly propulsive story-telling. Every scene
advances the story, and nearly every shot. The script is reasonably
literate, often wry, and manages the difficult task of integrating
its central characters into a believably vast panorama.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the quality of the acting. Vivien Leigh has always been
regarded as first-rate, but Clark Gable is at least as good. Gable
had the narrow range common to most movie stars, but within that
range he was capable of considerable variations.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, Gable always played a lovable tomcat. But in ``Gone
With the Wind,'' when he has to handle a fair amount of the kind of
thankless expositional dialogue usually given to supporting
players, Gable does it beautifully. The man was a total pro. Beyond
that, Rhett's anguish over the death of his daughter remains
completely convincing. Gable's performance has snap, energy and
passion, he moves well, and, God knows, looks fantastic.
</P>
<P>
   What doesn't work? As always, it requires a distorting
suspension of disbelief to believe that a woman of Scarlett's
wiliness and erotic energy could carry such a strong torch for the
hapless Ashley Wilkes _ one of the worst parts ever written, which
Leslie Howard is helpless to disguise.
</P>
<P>
   (By contrast, Olivia de Havilland's Melanie, a stock,
one-dimensional part, is nearly believable and rather touching.)
</P>
<P>
   What about the technical changes in this revival? The use of
dye-transfer Technicolor for the new prints shows up most
prominently in grace notes _ the creamy complexions, the vibrance
of a red hair ribbon, the electric blue of a sash, the amazingly
black blacks.
</P>
<P>
   The digitizing of the soundtrack has largely avoided the
artificial and unpleasant sharpness that can result from that
process. The new print offers more of a bass range than is common
in soundtracks from the '30s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gone With the Wind'' remains an ultimate example of the dream
factory at its best.

 &HT;    A way back machine
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The barber's tale had the ring of urban
legend.
</P>
<P>
   He'd heard about a wealthy man who was so fascinated by Model A
Fords that he tried for years to collect one in every shape and
style: sedan, convertible, pickup truck, you name it.
</P>
<P>
   They're all hidden in warehouses, the barber said, right here in
Palm Beach County. Fifty or more old cars, covered with tarps but
ready to run. The owner hates publicity. Probably no point trying
to talk to him.
</P>
<P>
   All the barber could offer to back up his story was the vague
location of a long-shuttered storage yard, and this advice: ``If
you can find the place, look around for a man named Mouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding the place took three tries.
</P>
<P>
   Way back beyond the road, beyond the weeds, beyond the broken
asphalt and the thick line of knotted trees stood a row of
signless, numberless warehouses so worn and weathered you might
miss them if you drove past a hundred times.
</P>
<P>
   And in the withering heat of the second bay, wrench in hand and
bandanna around his head, stood a slim but sinewy mechanic with
biceps toned by the weight of so many cast-iron engines and steel
fenders: ``Mouse'' Walborn.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 12 years now, Walborn _ who does not remember when
people stopped calling him Mike, much less why _ has opened shop at
7 a.m., seven days a week, and resumed the work of recreating an
era.
</P>
<P>
   After a bit of talk, and a couple of promises, Walborn put down
his tools long enough to roll back the big warehouse doors and
reveal his employer's remarkable secret: a movable document of life
and commerce during the most trying of modern times.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, Walborn uncovered what could be every car and truck
parked on any Main Street in the United States in 1931, second full
year of The Depression. ``Now you know how people lived back
then,'' Walborn said.
</P>
<P>
   Not just how they lived, but how they played, worked and died.
</P>
<P>
   He first uncovered an elegant, open-topped DeLuxe Phaeton with
rich leather seats, a car to defy the worst of times. Next, a coupe
with a sure cure for dour mood: a rumble seat.
</P>
<P>
   Then he uncovered a telephone repair truck, with tools and wires
ready to be strung. Then a milk truck, with crates and bottles; a
police car, with siren and spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   An open-back truck that carried cows to slaughter. A closed one
that carried the meat to butcher shops.
</P>
<P>
   An ambulance, a school bus, a United Parcel Service van, a
hearse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someday, when people see this, they'll understand that time
and the people a lot better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He has been waiting quite a while for that someday and has no
idea how much longer it will be. The goal is to build a museum to
preserve these cars and showcase those times, but where and when
are really up to The Boss, and he isn't close to working out those
details.
</P>
<P>
   The Boss is how Walborn refers to the man who pulled into a Palm
Beach gas station more than 20 years ago in a green Model A coupe.
Walborn was the station's mechanic, a trade he took up after years
on the road as trumpet-playing band leader of Mouse and the
Matadors. The man liked Mouse's work enough to come back with his
next Model A and the one after.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he hired Walborn full time, gave him a stack of
credit cards and checks and told him to buy more cars and hire
whomever else he needed to restore them. Walborn pointed out that
he was hardly an expert on Model A's. The Boss told him to become
one.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Walborn has at least three and often as many as six
people helping him grind, mill, sand and paint _ and 56 Model A's
to keep them busy.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of a handful of rusty shells, they all run
fine and many look better than new. Keeping them road-worthy is an
essential part of the job, because Walborn never knows when The
Boss will show up and call for the tan phaeton or the blue-green
convertible pickup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cars are meant to be driven, and he drives them,'' Walborn
said. ``So do we.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the only way to keep the batteries charged and the
bearings lubricated. Every day, Walborn and crew take one or two
Model A's out for a ride, twisting knobs and pulling levers in a
rhythmic routine that would confound anyone who learned to drive in
a modern car.
</P>
<P>
   A Model A driver adjusts the timing, sets the choke, raises or
lowers the idle and, most important in a car with no fuel pump,
opens a valve that lets gasoline flow from a tank mounted behind
and slightly above the engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, even we forget to open the valve and the car won't
start,'' Walborn said. ``And if you forget to close it, you come
back to the car and find a big puddle of gasoline and none in the
tank.''
</P>
<P>
   People stare, shout, wave and insist on sharing stories about
Sunday rides and first dates. From time to time, someone follows
them back to the shop, and then others are sure to come after.
</P>
<P>
   The Boss has two problems with that: There's still work to be
done, and he worries that vandals will ruin what's already been
accomplished. So The Boss was willing to be interviewed, but only
if the cars' location was kept secret, along with his name.
</P>
<P>
   He enjoys showing his cars to fellow Model A owners, but he
doesn't want to be bothered by speculators who want to buy his cars
or sell him theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has no taste for publicity, The Boss is no recluse.
At 60, he's still active in business and sport, dividing time
between Palm Beach and favorite hunting spots. Except for his
hunting truck, he drives nothing but Model A's, like the car he
learned to drive in.
</P>
<P>
   He has no idea what he has spent on his cars or their
restoration and upkeep and doesn't care.
</P>
<P>
   While rising labor costs have shifted old-car restoration
heavily toward more unusual and expensive cars, The Boss is
interested only in 1930 and '31 Model A Fords. ``It's an aesthetic
consideration,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His practiced eye recognizes them as slightly rounder and more
rakish than the 1928 and '29 models. Brand new, in a profusion of
striking colors such as Andalusite Blue and Rose Beige, they sold
for as little as $435. Nicely restored roadsters often sell today
for less than $20,000, little more than some owners invest in
parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never make a business of your hobby,'' The Boss said.
``Whatever you collect, you can't ever expect to sell something for
more than you paid.''
</P>
<P>
   The Model A was the successor to the Model T, that tipsy-looking
contraption seen flickering down rutted roads in old movies. The
Model T put America on wheels, but the Model A kept it there when
the bottom dropped out.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Ford, who showed no more regard for alphabetical order
than for other people's ideas about cars, made the Model A more
complicated and comfortable than the Model T, but it was just as
rugged and nearly as popular.
</P>
<P>
   In four years, including two that followed the stock market
crash of 1929, Ford sold more than 4 million Model A's. In a
country with twice the population, Toyota would need 10 years to
sell that many of today's best-selling car, the Camry.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just proliferation that infused America with Model
A's, it was permutation. As different as they look, all the cars
and trucks (known as Model AA's) are built around the same
40-horsepower, four-cylinder engine and basic mechanical parts.
</P>
<P>
   There are still thousands of Model A's running, but The Boss has
given Walborn a challenge that past success makes more difficult:
finding new ones different from the rest. He figures there were
more than 120 body styles but doesn't know how many still exist.
</P>
<P>
   The latest acquisition is the milk truck, with familiar stand-up
driving position, from the Rockford Dairy in Illinois. It's the
first addition in three years, and there won't be another until the
next really different Model A is discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the distinctions are easy to spot: Tudor or Fordor
sedans; open cars or closed. Others, such as the difference between
Standard and DeLuxe models, demand study.
</P>
<P>
   It's the commercial vehicles that are truly distinctive. The
taxi, for example, is one of only 10 built. The lettering, Capitol
Cab, faithfully follows the original, as does the trim on every
truck that could be read or discovered through research. Others are
whimsical: Gwen's Catering is a salute to a friend's cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Walborn has chased down cars all over the country, following
leads from classified ads and from other collectors. The best
prospects are often the least convenient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been to Montana when it was freezing and Wichita Falls
when it was 100 degrees,'' Walborn said.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, he's made friends and gained notice. A man called
from Germany recently to ask for help aligning a Model A's doors.
``I told him it was a little hard to tell what the problem was from
here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At 48, Walborn has no plans except to find more Model A's and
keep working on the ones already in the collection. There is no
end, in sight or beyond, because a restored car does not stay
restored forever. One or the other will always need new paint or an
overhauled motor.
</P>
<P>
   The deterioration is accelerated by the heat and humidity of the
warehouses, with further damage caused by rats and wild cats that
scratch the paint and upholstery. But Walborn shows no sign of
exasperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no stress to this, because The Boss just says to do
what needs to be done, and he leaves it up to me,'' Walborn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stress is working for some guy who's screaming that he wants
his Porsche right now,'' he said. ``Stress is fixing the guy's car,
and then he doesn't pay you. Here, if a fender gets scratched, it
just gives us something to do tomorrow.''

 &HT;    When windows opened

<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The Sun Belt owes its prosperity to air
conditioning. Few normal people would choose to live where it
starts getting into
</P>
<P>
   the triple digits in Spring and doesn't even cool down that much
at night.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the walk to the car, people can ignore the summer
heat in this part of the country. We travel in air-conditioned
cars, work
</P>
<P>
   and shop in air-conditioned buildings and eat our meals, watch
television and sleep in air-conditioned homes.
</P>
<P>
   But we can't ignore the heat when the air-conditioner goes out,
as it did the other night at the home of a Colorado ex-patriot and
colleague.
</P>
<P>
   Even though I am descended from generations of questionably
normal relatives who chose to live in this sweltering heat, I know
how my Rocky Mountain colleague felt sweating through the night
without air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   When I was a boy, no one I knew had air conditioning. I had a
bed on a screened sleeping porch in one house. That was a darned
good even when it didn't get below 80 at night.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes when the house refused to cool at night, and if the
mosquitoes weren't too bad, we drug our mattresses out in the back
yard under the Texas stars and hoped for a slight breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone back then slept with the doors and windows open. Those
who could afford it kept oscillating fans trained on their beds.
</P>
<P>
   Some people hung wet sheets over a window. Others put wet sheets
on their beds, a cooling trick I never liked. Sheets got wet enough
with sweat.
</P>
<P>
   A block of ice in front of an electric fan would have been an
excellent primitive air conditioner except no one could afford such
luxury. Ice was considered expensive and was needed for the icebox.
</P>
<P>
   The coolest place anyone could go in the days before air
conditioning was the ice house, a miraculous refuge from the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Most towns of moderate size had an ice house. Before air
conditioning and before average homeowners could afford electric
iceboxes (later
</P>
<P>
   known as refrigerators), ice was in such demand that the owner
of the ice house was often the richest man in town.
</P>

   WACO, Texas _ The Sun Belt owes its prosperity to air
conditioning. Few normal people would choose to live where it
starts getting into
</P>
<P>
   the triple digits in Spring and doesn't even cool down that much
at night.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the walk to the car, people can ignore the summer
heat in this part of the country. We travel in air-conditioned
cars, work
</P>
<P>
   and shop in air-conditioned buildings and eat our meals, watch
television and sleep in air-conditioned homes.
</P>
<P>
   But we can't ignore the heat when the air-conditioner goes out,
as it did the other night at the home of a Colorado ex-patriot and
colleague.
</P>
<P>
   Even though I am descended from generations of questionably
normal relatives who chose to live in this sweltering heat, I know
how my Rocky Mountain colleague felt sweating through the night
without air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   When I was a boy, no one I knew had air conditioning. I had a
bed on a screened sleeping porch in one house. That was a darned
good even when it didn't get below 80 at night.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes when the house refused to cool at night, and if the
mosquitoes weren't too bad, we drug our mattresses out in the back
yard under the Texas stars and hoped for a slight breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone back then slept with the doors and windows open. Those
who could afford it kept oscillating fans trained on their beds.
</P>
<P>
   Some people hung wet sheets over a window. Others put wet sheets
on their beds, a cooling trick I never liked. Sheets got wet enough
with sweat.
</P>
<P>
   A block of ice in front of an electric fan would have been an
excellent primitive air conditioner except no one could afford such
luxury. Ice was considered expensive and was needed for the icebox.
</P>
<P>
   The coolest place anyone could go in the days before air
conditioning was the ice house, a miraculous refuge from the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Most towns of moderate size had an ice house. Before air
conditioning and before average homeowners could afford electric
iceboxes (later
</P>
<P>
   known as refrigerators), ice was in such demand that the owner
of the ice house was often the richest man in town.
</P>
<P>
   Later when we moved into town, some homeowners installed devices
in windows that dripped water over screens in front of a powerful
fan. Those devices were used in many stores. Some motorists
installed small, ugly units on their cars. I seem to recall those
devices were called evapo-transporaters.
</P>
<P>
   Houses before the days of air conditioning had tall ceilings to
allow the heat to rise. In the evening, people gathered on porches,
sipped ice drinks, told stories and sometimes turned a bucket of
homemade ice cream while the children scurried about tiring
themselves out before bed.
</P>
<P>
   Poster-board fans stapled to tongue depressors were popular,
especially with women. The fans were tucked in with the hymnals in
church pews but
</P>
<P>
   often found their way home. Funeral parlors liked to put their
advertising on those fans.
</P>
<P>
   Every school kid knew how to fold a sheet of notebook paper into
a handy fan for those days when the classroom was like a sweat
lodge and the heat-rashed teacher was just one spitball away from a
pressure-cooker explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Families also used to go for car rides just to catch a cooling
breeze.
</P>
<P>
   In the days before cars, I suppose it was buggy rides. The first
``conditioned air'' stores and movie theaters were indeed a wonder.
It was like watching a movie in the ice house.

   DR-DOLITTLE-DAYTON _ Eddie Murphy launched his monumental
comeback with a remake of Jerry Lewis' The Nutty Professor, for

<P>
   COUSIN-BETTE _ Honore de Balzac's aim was to document every
aspect of the confusing period before the Revolution of 1848. He
did so with a ferocious energy, knocking out book after book filled

courtesans, wan artistes _ and in his novel ``Cousin Bette,'' one

Jessica Lange, and it takes the ``comedy'' bit very seriously.

   OPPOSITE-OFSEX _ Caution: Those who want to like and trust the
characters they watch are going to have a lot of trouble with Dedee
Truitt. She's a precocious, mean-spirited 16-year-old who narrates
``The Opposite of Sex,'' describing the trouble she stirs up and

trashy, a refreshingly different comic springboard for a

   DIARY-EYMAN _ ``Bridget Jones's Diary'' was last year's

here. It began as a weekly newspaper feature and seems ready-made
for a movie. It's a year in the life of a 30-something girl mired
in mid-level publishing, whose biological clock is resounding like
Big Ben. (Eyman, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   EVERGLADE-RESTORATION _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The federal plan
to save the Everglades depends on the untested practice of storing
up to 1.7 billion gallons of water underground every day during wet
years and pulling it back up during dry times. Never mind that
federal regulators at the highest levels are agonizing over the
idea of injecting untreated _ and possibly tainted _ lake water
into underground drinking sources. (Engelhardt, Palm Beach Post)

<P>
   EVERGLADE-RESCUE _ A half-century ago, weary from an unending
cycle of flood, drought and fire, South Florida residents asked
Washington to build them a barrier against the extremes of nature.
It worked. All too well. Now, the Everglades strangled in its
man-made straitjacket. Now the engineers say it's time to start
over. They want to redesign the entire drainage system.
Environmentalists call it the Everglades' last chance. (King, Palm

   NO-FIREWORKS _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Celebrate your liberty
this Fourth of July by setting off a bottle rocket anywhere in Palm
Beach County and you might wind up under arrest. But only if a law
enforcement officer actually sees you light the fuse. (Hayes, Palm
Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   WATER-SWT _ SAN MARCOS, Texas _ As Central Texas continues to
swelter under a merciless June sun and water becomes an
ever-more-precious resource, a 6-inch-wide pipeline behind a
popular seafood restaurant is creating watery battle lines in the
city. Construction of the pipeline comes at an especially sensitive
time, as temperatures around the state inch up and aquifer levels
steadily drop. (Rodriguez, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MODEL-T _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ For more than 12 years now,
``Mouse'' Walborn _ who does not remember when people stopped
calling him Mike, much less why _ has opened shop at 7 a.m., seven
days a week, and resumed the work of recreating an era. One by one,
Walborn uncovered what could be every car and truck parked on any
Main Street in the United States in 1931, second full year of The
Depression. (Kalajian, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   SOMETHING-OLD _ Dietrich became Mrs. Russell Warner during a
brief ceremony at the nursing home where they met less than two

   STYLE-KHAKIS _ To distinguish yourself from the khaki-clad

CLINTON BRACES FOR TIANANMEN SQUARE VISIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ President Clinton is walking a political tightrope by
accepting China's official welcoming ceremony overlooking the
98-acre expanse of Tiananmen Square where hundreds of unarmed
pro-democracy activists were killed by army troops in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will be the first American president to visit China
since the massacre and is expected to receive the standard
ceremonial welcome for a state visit. The ceremony is scheduled to
begin at 9 p.m. EDT Friday in front of the Great Hall of the People
overlooking the plaza that has been at the heart of Chinese
politics for generations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision to accept the Chinese salute is evoking a
storm of controversy back home. Congressional Republicans and
Democrats and human rights organizations have condemned his
readiness to participate in a ceremony near the site where
demonstrators erected a towering foam and plaster replica of the
Statue of Liberty before Chinese army troops moved in.
</P>
<P>
   The president will come face to face with that army _ the
People's Liberation Army _ when he reviews ranks of PLA troops. PLA
units will fire the 21-gun salute that welcomes heads of state. A
PLA band will play the Chinese and American national anthems.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Clinton nor Chinese President Jiang Zemin will speak
publicly during the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   For many Americans, the televised image of Clinton taking part
in a ceremony adjacent to Tiananmen Square will be their first
extended look at the site since the televised coverage of the
protests and the aftermath in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The president, arriving in the city of Xian late Thursday to
begin his nine-day visit to five cities, made only an elliptical
appeal for China to broaden human rights. Political issues are
touchy topics in a nation of 1.2 billion people that remains edgy
about organized political dissent five decades after a tumultuous
civil war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Respect for the worth, the dignity, the potential and the
freedom of every citizen is a vital source of America's strength
and success,'' Clinton told his Chinese hosts at a colorful,
drum-pounding, flag-waving welcome pageant beneath a massive
eight-story gate of a city that rivaled Rome and Constantinople in
the ancient world.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton added: ``In this global information age, where both
economic growth and individual opportunity are based on ideas, a
commitment to providing all human beings the opportunity to develop
their full potential is vital to the strength and success of the
new China, as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton flies to Beijing after completing a two-day visit to
Xian.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Chinese authorities rounded up dissidents and
assigned work crews to sweep streets and paint buildings at sites
awaiting Clinton's visit.
</P>
<P>
   In Xian, police detained Yan Jun, one of 70 Chinese who signed a
letter asking Clinton to meet dissidents during his visit. In the
southern city of Guilin where Clinton stops next Thursday, police
arrested Li Xiaolong, 34, a member of the now-defunct dissident
group Human Rights Voice.
</P>
<P>
   Police, however, permitted tens of thousands of Chinese to line
Clinton's 30-mile motorcade route into Xian from the airport.
</P>
<P>
   At a refueling stop at Elmendorf AFB in Alaska, Clinton
described his approach to China during remarks to Air Force
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to human rights, we should deal respectfully,
but directly with the Chinese,'' Clinton said. ``That's more
effective than trying to push them in a corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton repeatedly defended his decision to take part in the
15-minute official welcoming ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial ceremony takes place adjacent to Tiananmen
Square about 100 yards across a multi-lane boulevard in front of
the Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Clinton hopes to deflect criticism back home by
publicly _ and subtly _ urging Jiang to apologize for the crackdown
when the two leaders hold a news conference after the welcoming
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton road tested the approach in a June 11 address at the
National Geographic Society. Chinese leaders ``can only move beyond
the events of June 1989 when they recognize the reality that what
the government did was wrong,'' Clinton declared. ``Sooner or later
they must do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's bid won the support of former Communist Party chief
Zhao Ziyang, who urged Chinese leaders to admit the mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than let it become an obstacle to international
relations, it would be better to resolve the June 4 problem
ourselves voluntarily,'' wrote Zhao, 78, who was ousted as general
secretary of the Communist Party in 1989 after resisting the
crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government has never apologized. The pre-Jiang
leadership appeared on state-run television five days after the
killings to praise the PLA for suppressing a ``counterrevolutionary
rebellion.''
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said Clinton does not plan to meet with
Chinese dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials who stubbornly resisted private U.S. efforts
to shift the welcoming ceremony elsewhere are hailing the Tiananmen
Square ceremony as a sign that U.S-China relations have recovered
from the post-Tiananmen chill.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is important is the visit itself, its symbolic value,'' a
senior Chinese officials told a White House pool reporter. ``It
means that we now can finally leave behind us the problems we have
and open a new era in the relationship.''

GOSPEL OF PEACE ARISES FROM CONFLICT IN VIETNAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Luciano Perez, raised in the late 1950s in a hard-scrabble
section of Los Angeles, had a vision while stationed in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The killing fields of Southeast Asia in fact changed Perez
permanently. They converted the soldier to a man of peace. His
vision, that skin color and gender should not separate us, that
love should replace violence, became his raison d'etre.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, 47, director of the Inter-Tribal Peace and Healing Center
in Valley Center, Calif., now is hoping to lead as many people as
possible in his quest for world peace. Dance and song are his
primary tools, along with prayer and sweat, as he travels the world
promoting harmony among people.
</P>
<P>
   Perez is of Purepecha Indian and Mexican heritage. He was named
a Lakota chief, a title of the highest respect, two years ago. Six
years ago, coinciding with the 500th anniversary of Europeans'
arrival in North America, Perez completed 40 days of fasting and
praying for a vision, a means by which to deliver his gospel of
peace.
</P>
<P>
   What followed was a four-day dance in southern California
devoted to the principle of unity, the first of what was to become
an annual peace dance. The October dances draw people from many
nations, and for the past three years they have taken place in the
White Mountains of Arizona on land purchased by the Inter-Tribal
Peace and Healing Center.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to make the peace dance available to people unable
to travel to Arizona, Perez is holding versions of the dance this
year throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   Next week he will be in upstate New York, leading a three-day
dance for peace amid the fertile, rolling hills near Cooperstown.
The dance, spiritual in nature, embodies Perez's quest for harmony.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sacred, spiritual event for anyone interested in the
`old' ways,'' said Lenny Singer, who owns the property where the
dance will take place. ``Chief Luciano wants to bring together both
victims and victimizers, because he believes it's the only way
indigenous and all people will be able to live in peace.''
</P>
<P>
   While Perez, as a representative of the Lakota nation and
director of the Inter-Tribal Peace and Healing Center, is
particularly sensitive to Native-American issues, his perspective
regarding victims is all-embracing, according to Singer. Indians,
women, people of color, all merit a more level playing field in
Perez's view.
</P>
<P>
   Perez and Singer hope the peace dance will encourage the
participants to take part in a peace walk planned for Sept. 15 in
New York. The walk, being held during the week of the World Street
Peace Summit, an annual United Nations-sponsored event, will start
in Harlem and end at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The walk, just like the peace dance, is about unity and
breaking down barriers between people of different colors and
backgrounds,'' Singer explained. ``This is all part of Luciano's
particular vision, and what he sees as his role in replacing
violence and abuse with love and respect.''

FOR CHATEAU MONTELENA, IT'S BACK TO THE FUTURE(S) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICHAEL LONSFORD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I saw these consecutive quotes the other day, and talk about
your jarring juxtaposition:
</P>
<P>
   ``Wine is bottled poetry'' _ Robert Louis Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poetry is the devil's wine'' _ St. Augustine.
</P>
<P>
   Wine and poetry _ now there are two subjective topics that could
keep a conversation going for hours.
</P>
<P>
   That came to mind the other day when I ran across this Spanish
proverb couplet:
</P>
<P>
   ``Con pan y vino
</P>
<P>
   se anda el camino.``
</P>
<P>
   (Literally: With bread and wine you can walk your road.)
</P>
<P>
   Well, I guess I could keep on truckin' with those two staples,
although some red meat occasionally wouldn't hurt. Especially if
the red meat was braised lamb shanks and if the red wine was a
California cabernet sauvignon such as Chateau Montelena.
</P>
<P>
   Chateau Montelena dates to the 1880s, but fell dormant for years
before being resuscitated in 1972 by the Barrett family. It gained
instant fame in 1976 when its 1973 chardonnay came in first in the
famous Paris taste-off between top California and French wines. The
Montelena chardonnay, along with the 1973 Stag's Leap Cabernet, put
California on the world map, bending a number of French noses out
of joint in the process.
</P>
<P>
   While Montelena continues to make a fine chardonnay that's made
for food, not for lovers of overextracted white wines, its fame
today rests primarily with its estate cabernet sauvignon.
</P>
<P>
   Winemaker Bo Barrett was in Houston recently to show off a
vertical (consecutive vintages) of the Montelena cabernet, as well
as announce a new futures program for the cabernet. Futures
offerings _ wherein consumers pony up their cash right after a
vintage, usually at a savings _ are designed to allow consumers to
acquire highly allocated wines that might otherwise not be
available. Those offerings also allow the winery to get the money
up front and adjust prices according to market demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think our estate cabernet is underpriced,'' Barrett said,
``but how do you raise prices without abandoning the people who
brought you to the party 25 years ago? It's not the money, it's the
prestige. But the futures offering has to benefit the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the French, particularly the Bordeaux merchants, have
been offering wines this way for eons. Futures offerings in
California are a much newer proposition, and one with a spotty
track record.
</P>
<P>
   There are some pitfalls in a futures offering, not the least of
which is what happens when the vintage is a lousy one?
</P>
<P>
   The current Chateau Montelena cabernet is the 1994 vintage, but
that vaunted vintage has been snapped up. Montelena's distributor,
Republic Beverage, will have the 1995 vintage available this fall.
Estimated retail price will be in the $60-$70 a bottle range.
</P>
<P>
   As for tasting the skein of vintages, I did find a consistency
in style, but the wines did vary by vintages.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest wine was a barrel sample of the 1996 Chateau
Montelena cabernet, which won't be available probably until next
year. Too young and grapey to assess fairly.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest wine was the 1991, which you may find on a stray
restaurant wine list (at a dear price), and it was terrific.
</P>
<P>
   The other outstanding vintage was the 1994, which in a couple of
years (did anyone say the year 2000?) should be hitting its peak.
</P>
<P>
   The 1992 was thinner and a bit acidic, the '93 showed some
leather and tobacco nuances, not unlike an aging Bordeaux, and '95
showed good fruit, but it's a bit young to drink right now.
</P>
<P>
   As for what the future _ not futures _ will bring, the 1997
Chateau Montelena cabernet, Barrett said, is going to be
sensational. ``It's a career vintage.''
</P>
<P>
   But going back to the Spanish proverb: With the '91 and '94
cabernets I nibbled on a piece of bread, the wines were that good,
and I didn't want any palate distractions. The others I drank with
the lamb shank. But with the ``starter'' course, which was some
outstanding raviolis and wild mushrooms, I drank water; I found the
cabernets too hard and iron-fisted for the delicacy of the pasta.
The raviolis and mushrooms would've been excellent with a red
burgundy or pinot noir, though.

COURT RULES LINE-ITEM VETO UNCONSTITUTIONAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that Congress
violated the principle of separation of powers when it gave the
president the power to cut individual projects from tax and
spending bills without vetoing the entire legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In a 6-3 ruling, the court said the 1996 Line Item Veto Act
unconstitutionally allows the president, by altering a bill after
its passage, to create a law that was not voted on by either house
of Congress. The court also said the 1996 measure authorized the
president to issue what were, in practical terms, partial vetoes.
</P>
<P>
   In passing the law, Congress said the president could cancel
individual items in tax and spending bills within five days of
signing them into law. Congress, however, was allowed to try to
reinstate the items by having both houses pass them in separate
bills.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was the first president to exercise a line-item veto, an
authority sought by nearly every chief executive this century as a
tool to limit pork-barrel spending.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the court, said the
law ``authorized the president himself to effect the repeal of
laws, for his own policy reasons, without observing Article 1
procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   Article 1 of the Constitution established the principle of
separation of powers among the three branches of government.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens concluded that the 1996 act ``may or may not be
desirable, but it is surely not a document'' that is
constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the justices heard a challenge to the act brought by
six members of Congress, but it dismissed their suit, saying they
had no standing to sue because they had not suffered any injury
because of the veto, which at that point Clinton had not exercised.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the president has canceled 82 items in 11 laws. One
was a Medicaid tax benefit to New York City, which challenged the
law, claiming it was injured by the veto.
</P>
<P>
   The Snake River Potato Growers and an officer of the Idaho group
also sued, saying they were injured by Clinton's veto of a tax
measure that would have allowed agricultural processors to defer
capital-gains taxes when they sell their plants to farmers'
cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a U.S. District Court here ruled the line-item veto
unconstitutional, saying Congress violated the Constitution's
separation of powers clause by delegating such authority to the
president.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the high court agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens acknowledged the ``profound importance'' of the case,
saying, ``The court expresses no opinion about the wisdom of the
act's procedures and does not lightly conclude that the actions of
the Congress that passed it, and the president who signed it into
law, were unconstitutional.''
</P>
<P>
   In their arguments before the court, lawyers for the challengers
said that no matter when a president changes the spending bill or
for what reasons, the bottom line is that what takes effect was not
passed by both chambers of Congress, as required by the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   In his argument for the Clinton administration, U.S. Solicitor
General Seth Waxman contended that a line-item veto would not
actually repeal part of a law but would be a presidential exercise
of spending authority delegated by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens was joined in his opinion by Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, David Souter, Clarence
Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Stephen Breyer, Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia
dissented.
</P>
<P>
   Breyer's dissent said that while the Line Item Veto Act ``skirts
a constitutional edge ... it does not violate any basic separation
of powers principle.''
</P>
<P>
   In other major decisions Thursday, the court ruled:
</P>
<P>
   By a 6-3 vote that the attorney-client privilege does not end
with the death of the client. It thus blocked Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr's attempt to obtain notes taken by James Hamilton,
the lawyer for deputy White House counsel Vincent Foster Jr. nine
days before Foster committed suicide in July 1993.
</P>
<P>
   That the government can deny cash grants to artists because
their work is considered indecent, saying the policy does not
violate artists' free-speech rights. The 8-1 decision said the
National Endowment for the Arts can consider decency, as well as
artistic merit, in deciding who gets public money for the arts.
</P>
<P>
   That HIV-infected people are protected by a federal ban on
discrimination against the disabled even if they suffer no symptoms
of AIDS. The 5-4 ruling ordered a lower court to reconsider whether
a Maine dentist violated the Americans With Disabilities Act when
he refused to fill an HIV-infected woman's tooth in his office.

TEXAS FINALLY FREE OF SMOKE FROM MEXICO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL HANNA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The smoke from Mexican forest fires that turned Texas skies a
murky brown for more than a month appears to have paid its last
visit across the border.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rain during recent weeks, combined with the efforts of
more than 1,300 firefighters, has reduced the number of Mexican
fires to 34. Since January, 13,634 fires have consumed more than
1.25 million acres in Mexico, according to the U.S. Agency for
International Development, which is coordinating U.S. firefighting
assistance to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   A patch of smoke from the fires moved across West Texas on
Friday, said Bryan Lambeth, senior meteorologist for the Texas
Natural Resource Conservation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was pretty much the last gasp we're going to see,''
Lambeth said. ``I think it's likely we will not see any more of it
_ for this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The weather in southern Mexico and Central America has
dramatically changed during the past three weeks, said Steve Fano,
a National Weather Service meteorologist.
</P>
<P>
   A tropical wave moved onto Mexico's east coast at mid-week and
Hurricane Blas was sitting off the country's western coast. Both
systems were pumping moisture into Mexico's dense forests, which
firefighters have found virtually impenetrable. Satellite images
showed much of the fire-plagued states of Chiapas and Oaxaca hidden
beneath clouds on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A report released Tuesday by the Agency for International
Development said only 17 Mexican fires were still considered out of
control as of June 18.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven fires were still listed as ``large priority fires'' _
five in Chiapas, three in the state of Tamaulipas, and one each in
the states of Nuevo Leon, Hidalgo and San Luis Potosi.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent flyovers, which ended June 14, found that fires
in Chiapas and Oaxaca had dramatically declined because of recent
thunderstorm activity, the report said. As recently as Sunday, 2.13
inches of rain fell in sections of Chiapas, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Showers also helped dampen fires in Guatemala, Nicaragua, El
Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   Satellite images still detected slight traces of smoke moving
along the Pacific coast of Mexico on Monday, but clouds and rain
either hid the remaining haze or had caused it to dissipate, Fano
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm not confident to say any plume of smoke is in
that area of southern Mexico,'' Fano said. ``There may be a plume
hiding in there somewhere but I can't see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Texas, the rainy weather in Mexico shows no
sign of moving north, forecasters said.
</P>
<P>
   Even a tropical disturbance in the Gulf of Mexico will likely
bring relief for only the southernmost portions of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brownsville is a little bit excited about it, but for the rest
of us it doesn't look good,'' Fano said. ``If it does keep going
way the way it is going, the southern tip of Texas may see some
relief. But forecasts have it going 100 to 150 miles south of
Brownsville. That won't bring much relief for them.''

TEXAS DEMOCRATS GATHER IN SAN ANTONIO FOR STATE CONVENTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAX B. BAKER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED _ At their convention this month, Texas Republicans were
elated at the idea of Gov. George W. Bush leading a historic
statewide sweep in November, including taking control of the Texas
House.
</P>
<P>
   But as 8,500 Democratic delegates and alternates gathered in San
Antonio's Alamodome on Thursday for their state convention, party
leaders scoffed at the notion of a Bush-led political blitzkrieg
ending Democrats' hold on the House.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are confident of maintaining their control of the
House and predict that they will retake the state Senate after
losing it in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see no evidence of their taking the state House,'' said
Jorge Ramirez, executive director of the Texas Democratic Party.
``They will have a difficult time holding on to what they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say they have recruited a strong slate of candidates
that will help them protect their eight-seat majority in the House,
and they say they are targeting three Republican state Senators for
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   And one Republican political consultant said that although
Bush's message is extremely popular with Democrats and Republicans,
Texas voters also like split-ticket voting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The common trend is that in rural districts where Republicans
do well at the top of the ticket, Democrats still control the local
offices,'' said Bryan Eppstein, a Fort Worth Republican political
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   In the March primaries, Democrats had 664,690 ballots cast
compared with 597,011 for the Republicans. The Democrats' higher
vote total came despite most of the action being in the Republican
primary.
</P>
<P>
   The theme at the Republican State Convention in Fort Worth this
month was ``Changing the Course of Texas History,'' reflecting the
Republicans' goal of commanding all branches of state government.
</P>
<P>
   To accomplish that feat, Republicans will have to hold onto
their majority in the Senate and win eight additional seats to take
control of the 150-seat state House.
</P>
<P>
   Six House seats are up for grabs in November that are being
given up by Democrats, including heavyweights such as Beaumont Rep.
Mark Stiles, Huntsville Rep. Allen Hightower and Gatesville Rep.
Allen Place.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans predict that they will take no fewer than four of
those seats and more likely all six. Depending on the length of
Bush's coattails, the GOP could win as many as 12 new House seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush will have to do poorly to get four or less,'' said
Arlington Rep. Kent Grusendorf, a leader in the Republican Party's
``8 in 98,'' an organization dedicated to winning control of the
Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP is equally upbeat about maintaining control of the
Senate and electing _ for the first time since Reconstruction _ a
Republican lieutenant governor to set the agenda in that chamber.
Rick Perry is the GOP nominee for that post.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are forecasting double-digit gains in the House,'' said
Robert Black, spokesman for the state Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said Republicans are being presumptuous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans are hoping for George Bush to pull voters over
in the House races. They will fail in that,'' Ramirez said. ``The
one thing that is clear is that Bush doesn't have coattails.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent Texas Poll helps proves their point, Democrats said.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush holds a 70 percent to 17 percent lead over Democratic
challenger Garry Mauro, Perry holds only a 3 percentage point lead
over Democratic nominee John Sharp in the race for lieutenant
governor. The margin of error in the poll is plus or minus 3.7
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   In the race for attorney general, Democrat Jim Mattox leads
former Texas Supreme Court Justice John Cornyn, 44 percent to 35
percent, according to the poll.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are mounting aggressive and well-financed campaigns to
retain the six House seats being given up by Democratic incumbents
, said Rafe Bemporad, a state party spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Ritter, a businessman from a well-known family in the
Beaumont area, is seeking Stiles' seat, and insurance agent and
Vietnam veteran David Lengefeld is putting on a ``first-rate''
campaign for Place's seat, Bemporad said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Democrats are targeting Republican state Sen.
Michael Galloway from The Woodlands for defeat, as well as Bryan
Sen. Steve Ogden and Wichita Falls Sen. Tom Haywood.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Mary Moore is challenging Ogden, who barely defeated
Moore in a special election in 1997. David Bernsen, a former state
transportation commissioner, is expected to run a close race with
Galloway.
</P>
<P>
   Former Bowie Mayor Greg Underwood is taking on Haywood, who was
elected in 1995 in a district that was traditionally a Democratic
stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats will campaign on issues such as education, welfare
reform and tax fairness _ issues that resonate with most of Texas
voters, Bemporad said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the important things that the Democrats have
done this year is articulate where they want to take the state in
the future on issues important to voters,''Bemporad said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have concrete ideas that will help families. The
Republicans haven't done that. All they have is Bush.''

 &HT;    SOME DEFICIT FOES ARE NOSTALGIC FOR RED INK
 &HT;    With FEDBUD-DATA
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a three-decade struggle that included a
national crusade to add a balanced-budget amendment to the U.S.
Constitution, the federal deficit monster has morphed into a budget
surplus. So why, instead of dancing in the streets, are some
thrift-minded conservatives positively glum?
</P>
<P>
   For many of these deficit warriors, it's a hollow victory. After
the long push to shrink government, trim waste and attack fraud,
the red ink has turned black. But the government itself is no
smaller, arguably no less wasteful and still running on billions of
dollars borrowed from the Social Security trust fund reserved for
future retirees.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, without the menacing threat of huge deficits, the
restraint on spending is easing up on Congress and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prospect of a surplus as far as the eye can see has
obliterated the need to cut spending,'' opined Scott Hodge, author
of numerous budget studies for the Heritage Foundation, a
conservative Washington research group. ``It's a missed
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the budget is technically in balance, Hodge and
other fiscal conservatives point out that:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Federal spending continues to climb to historic levels, rising
an estimated $70 billion this year, a 4.3 percent increase that is
more than double the rate of inflation.  &QR;  Revenues are soaring
toward a new historic high, consuming at least 20.4 percent of the
gross domestic product this year. It is this largely unexpected
windfall of tax receipts from the booming U.S. economy _ not
spending cuts _ that produced the first balanced budget since 1969.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The big federal bureaucracy has survived largely intact.
Although the federal work force has been trimmed by 300,000
workers, Republicans did not fulfill their promises of dramatic
cutbacks when they won majority control of Congress in 1994. Not a
single major agency has been closed, and when House Budget Chairman
John Kasich, R-Ohio, made a run this spring at closing the Commerce
and Energy departments, he was criticized by lawmakers in his own
party and dropped the plan.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Massive waste and mismanagement continues largely unabated, as
documented by a steady flow of reports issued by the government
itself. Medicare makes an estimated $23 billion a year in improper
payments, enough to pay for the entire food stamp program. In a
recent attempt to account for all of the government's assets, the
Federal Aviation Administration could not find $245 million in
spare parts, and the Navy could not immediately locate 21 vessels.
The Treasury Department was unable to reconcile $100 billion in
transactions among agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, when you have a time when the government has
plenty of money, the urgency to fix these problems is reduced,''
said Stephen Moore, vice president of the Cato Institute, a
Washington-based libertarian group. As exhibit A, he cited the
just-enacted $204 billion highway bill, the largest in history,
with its record-breaking pork-barrel projects that lawmakers
inserted for their home districts.
</P>
<P>
   For Moore and some others, the solution is to reduce the
surpluses before the lawmakers find new ways to spend. ``These
politicians see a surplus and dollar signs are dancing in their
eyes,'' he said. ``A tax cut is a pre-emptive measure to prevent
them from establishing new entitlement programs that got us into
this trouble in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Still others are seeking ways to bring back the specter of the
deficit by reminding the public that it has never really gone away.
Forecasts show that without huge and growing Social Security trust
fund surpluses, the government's operations will continue to run in
the red for the foreseeable future. However, the ``unified''
accounting system, set up during the 1960s under President Lyndon
Johnson, makes the overall government appear to have a surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Although some lawmakers have discussed taking the trust fund out
of the deficit calculations, there has been no serious attempt by
congressional leaders to change the accounting system, which
critics see as a shell game to hide the operating deficit. ``We
don't have a surplus,'' said Robert Bixby, policy director for the
Concord Coalition, a non-partisan group that is seeking to reduce
spending and reform Social Security. ``We're actually still running
a budget deficit. It's just that everybody ignores it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need to focus people's attention on is that until we
can balance the budget without counting the Social Security
surplus, we don't really have a surplus to spend,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But that has been a difficult case to make, said Stan Collender,
a federal budget consultant at the public relations firm of
Fleishman-Hillard Inc. and one of the capital's foremost budget
experts.
</P>
<P>
   Fiscal conservatives are now in a quandary, he said. ``This is
for them what defense hawks felt when the Berlin Wall fell. There's
no enemy out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Mitchell, an economist at the Heritage Foundation,
conceded that balancing the budget has sent his organization back
to the drawing board. ``We just need to focus back on the merits or
demerits of particular government programs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we really wanted to do is shrink the federal government
to its proper constitutional functions,'' he said. ``But we sort of
used the deficit as the reason, and it's come back and it's bitten
us.''

`OUT OF SIGHT' IS ENTERTAINING, CHARMING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's definitely something in the air this movie summer.
Filmmakers seem to be serving notice they're sick to death of the
formulas and cliches that have ruled the multiplexes for the past
two decades and they're not going to take it any more.
</P>
<P>
   And this revolution, if that's what it is, is not coming from
the independent, art or foreign film scene, which is still very
much mired in mediocrity. It's coming from mainstream Hollywood,
and films like ``The Truman Show,'' ``Bulworth,'' and even ``The
X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest example of the phenomenon is ``Out of Sight,'' which
is the movies' umpteenth version of an Elmore Leonard novel in
recent years, done, in fact, by the same screenwriter (Scott Frank)
and production team that gave us the 1995 Leonard-adaptation, ``Get
Shorty.''
</P>
<P>
   But this time out, their film is visually innovative,
structurally fragmented, cavalier in its attitude toward plot, and
determined to go against expectations at every turn. It's very
close to one of those Robert Altman genre deconstructions of the
'70s, only more entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   The story is about a charming bank robber (George Clooney) and a
beautiful federal marshal (Jennifer Lopez) who met cute one night
in the trunk of a car (yes, that's right) when he's escaping from a
Florida prison and she's briefly taken hostage.
</P>
<P>
   They can't stop thinking about one other, and the rest of the
movie has her chasing him as he moves from Florida to snowy Detroit
and wanders through a complicated scheme to steal some diamonds
from a Mike Milkin-like Wall Street tycoon (Albert Brooks).
</P>
<P>
   But the movie cares less about the credibility of its plot than
perhaps any major Hollywood movie in years. And director Steven
Soderbergh (``sex, lies and videotape'') goes for a bewildering,
three-part, non-linear structure, flashing back and forth between
the present and two of the hero's past prison sentences.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the film assiduously avoids all the little
audience-pleasers and de rigueur scenes that have become the
cliches of the romantic thriller genre. When the plot calls for a
mass murder, for instance, Soderbergh is happy to not rub our faces
in it: he merely implies what happens with a few hasty visual
symbols.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, ``Out of Sight'' is that rare Hollywood movie of the
'90s that is not afraid to operate off the energy of its romance.
The only motivation the characters really have in the script is
that they're crazy for each other. Not surprisingly, the best scene
in the movie is an impressionistic but sexy love scene.
</P>
<P>
   Does it work? Maybe not for everyone. Audiences of the '90s are
so conditioned to formula conventions that the structure, pacing
and even the glossy, surreal visual style of the movie (it often
looks computer-animated) are probably going to put a lot of people
off. In many ways, it's a demanding movie, especially in its first
act.
</P>
<P>
   Those willing to be stay with it, however, will be rewarded with
a film that's funny, sophisticated and packed with irresistible
dialogue and delightful supporting performances (especially Dennis
Farina as Lopez's over-protective father). It's probably the
movies' best evocation to date of the distinctive world of Elmore
Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   It's also one terrific star vehicle. Soderbergh seems to have
taught George Clooney that, on the big screen, less is always best,
and, for the first time in five tries, he actually comes off as an
appealing, high-octane movie star. Jennifer Lopez is even better _
tough, vulnerable, poetry-in-motion. Together, they make a most
combustible team.
</P>
<P>
   Out of Sight. Directed by Steven Soderbergh. Screenplay by Scott
Frank. Cast: George Clooney, Jennifer Lopez, Ving Rhames, Albert
Brooks. Universal. 120 minutes. Rated R for violence.

LITTLE FEELS NEW IN UPDATE OF `DR. DOOLITTLE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 1967 family film ``Dr. Dolittle,'' which starred the suavely
arrogant English actor Rex Harrison as a doctor who can talk to
animals, had only marginal charm.
</P>
<P>
   So it's hard to figure why either star Eddie Murphy _ who seemed
to be making a comeback after ``The Nutty Professor'' _ or Betty
Thomas, the director of such surprise hits as ``Private Parts'' and
``The Brady Bunch Movie,'' would have much interest in doing a
remake of a mediocre movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Dolittle'' has been updated with a '90s sensibility, but
outside of throwing in endless scatological references (the word
``butt'' is uttered at least 10 times), sexual innuendos as prime
jokes and a vogue soundtrack that includes Aaliyah and Twista &AMP; The
Speed Knot Mobsters, there's very little that feels new or
contemporary about it.
</P>
<P>
   In its heart, it still extols the virtue of good old-fashioned
family values, individuality and honesty over greed.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Dolittle has the capacity to communicate with animals _
an ability he suppressed in childhood but which has suddenly
re-surfaced. It's wreaking havoc on his medical practice, which is
about to be bought out by a big company, his family and his life.
</P>
<P>
   But his four-legged patients are thrilled by the fact that they
have a human to communicate with and to share their complaints
about aches and pains and woes at living in a world run by people
and their unpredictable ways. Dr. Dolittle must decide whether to
forego wealth for integrity _ and it certainly isn't much of a
surprise which way he goes.
</P>
<P>
   Though Murphy is known primarily as an edgy stand-up comedian
and comic actor, he plays the title role with dull restraint and
reserve. He brings so little of his usual flair and characteristic
humor to the part that it feels as if any actor could have filled
the lead. He definitely takes a backseat to his furry friends.
</P>
<P>
   Though the animals are the real stars of the show, even they
feel contrived and ordinary. There have been so many recent films
that feature talking animals _ ``Babe,'' ``Paulie,'' ``Look Who's
Talking'' and the upcoming DreamWorks production, ``Antz'' _ that
the idea feels worn and threadbare.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the impressive lineup of voice talent, including Albert
Brooks, Ellen DeGeneres, Chris Rock, John Leguizamo, Jenna Elfman
and Garry Shandling (among others), there's very little originality
or creativity to the story and the humor is tepid.
</P>
<P>
   Even its moral message _ that animals have feelings and are our
friends on the planet _ doesn't take hold with any real force.
Though ``Dr. Dolittle'' doesn't put the actors _ or animals _ to
shame, it certainly doesn't have anything exciting to offer either.
It's uninspired, formulaic and doesn't have much bark _ or bite.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dolittle. Directed by Betty Thomas. Written by Nat Mauldin,
Larry Levin. Cast: Eddie Murphy, Ossie Davis, Oliver Platt. 20th
Century Fox. 85 minutes. Rated PG-13 for intense scenes with
animals, animal surgery, sexual innuendo.

CHILDREN'S BOOKS PROMISE JOURNEYS FULL OF FUN, ADVENTURE AND
LEARNING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JANE P. MARSHALL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Books are Rollerblades and yachts, kayaks and
Explorers, 747s and motorcycles. They take you anywhere in the
world for a summer vacation _ across the street or across the
ocean. The mode of travel is as exciting and varied as the
destination.
</P>
<P>
   Hop aboard.
</P>
<P>
   These new books for children promise many journeys full of fun,
adventure and, yes, learning.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``My Life With the Wave'' (Lothrop, Lee &AMP; Shepard, $16) based
on the story by Octavio Paz; translated and adapted by Catherine
Cowan; illustrated by Mark Buehner. Cowan and Buehner have honored
Paz's wonderful story with this version for children. A young lad,
on his first trip to the beach, falls in love with waves. One
follows him to shore, where they play. The wave wants to go home
with the lad, and, finally, his parents agree. You can imagine the
problems when you live with a wave. This enchanting tale captures
the essence of youth, of summer, of a life led with imagination and
joy.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I Lost My Bear'' (Morrow, $16) by Jules Feiffer. This is a
true story. Ask any parent. Ask any kid. A girl loses her favorite
stuffed animal _ her bear. And she looks and looks. She gets advice
from others on detecting. What an adventure _ a familiar one.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Journey Home'' (Lee &AMP; Low, $15.95) by Lawrence McKay Jr.;
illustrated by Dom and Keunhee Lee. Mai and her mother travel to
Vietnam to search for roots. Mai's mother was a war orphan, and
this is her first trip back to her homeland. Together they learn
who they are and feel the tug of belonging to two places.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Jukebox Man'' (Dial Books, $15.99) by Jaqueline K.
Ogburn; illustrated by James Ransome. Poppaw is a jukebox man.
Every Saturday he takes Donna on his rounds to repair broken
jukeboxes, change records, and empty dimes and quarters from the
money box. They stop at diners, truck stops and fish camps.
Everybody knows Poppaw, and everybody knows Donna's favorite song
is B-6 _ ``Blue Suede Shoes.'' The story and pictures (oils on
paper) take young readers to an unfamiliar time. But the feeling is
familiar. It is that special bond between a child and a grandparent
who takes time to let the child into his world.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Legend of Mexicatl'' (Turtle Books, $15.95) by Jo
Harper; illustrated by Robert Casilla. Harper tells the story of
how the people of Mexico got their name, their flag and their
capital city with clarity and empathy. Young Mexicatl learns, after
a harsh lesson, the difference between being a good leader and a
poor leader as he guides a group of followers from the desert (some
believe the Aztecs came from as far north as Utah) to a lake
surrounded by mountains. They founded the city of Tenochititla'n,
where Mexico City now stands.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``My Father's Boat'' (Scholastic, $15.95) by Sherry Garland;
illustrated by Ted Rand. Garland, a Houston author who specializes
in books for children and young adults about the Vietnamese
culture, has another winner with this story of a
Vietnamese-American boy who spends a day on his father's shrimp
boat. The boat takes them into the Gulf of Mexico, but Father's
story, unwinding throughout the day, takes them to the South China
Sea, where the father and his father learned to be fishermen. The
story is about sharing family history and about not forgetting.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Baba Yaga and the Wise Doll'' (Dutton, $15.99) retold by
Hiawyn Oram; illustrated by Ruth Brown. Just when you wanted to
holler ``enough of the Baba Yaga stories,'' one like this comes
along. It involves child-gobbling toads, a little girl named Too
Nice, and two evil sisters named Horrid and Very Horrid. The
illustrations are as magical as the witch Baba Yaga, who has never
looked so enchantingly devilish. Her toads look even grander.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Mapped Out!: The Search for Snookums'' (Gibbs-Smith, $19.95)
by Carol Baicker-McKee; illustrated by Traci O'Very Covey. This is
a halfway-to-Colorado book. It starts with a lively story of Lon
Stori, who let the iguana he was pet-sitting be pet-napped.
Snookums is no ordinary iguana; it's an endangered Pukapukan iguana
that belongs to Lon's grandmother, the famous naturalist. Lon begs
Bianca Beare, the renowned blind detective who solves most of her
cases from the comfort of her specially constructed rocking chair,
to take the case. The reader takes on the persona of Eyeballs, Ms.
Beare's summer assistant. Eyeballs must be the detective's eyes,
following maps, figuring coordinates, and navigating with compasses
and train timetables. Maps, ransom notes, and other clues to solve
the case and find Snookums come with the book. Kids won't even
realize they are learning. A clever idea cleverly executed.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Summer My Father Was Ten'' (Boyds Mills, $15.95) by Pat
Brisson; illustrated by Andrea Shine. That summer, Father learns a
hard lesson when he and his friends vandalize Mr. Bellavista's
garden. As he rebuilds, he does more than replace the garden. He
builds a friendship and a tradition that he shares each summer with
his son. The watercolors are rich and beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Special Effects in Film and Television'' (DK Publishing,
$17.95) by Jake Hamilton. No, ``Deep Impact'' and ``X-Files''
aren't here, but you can learn how the New York skyline turned
futuristic in ``The Fifth Element,'' how big became bigger in ``The
Borrowers'' and how Jim Carrey bugged his eyeballs out of his skull
in ``The Mask.'' SFX (special effects) also turn men into monsters,
create fake snow and windstorms, and make toys breathe fire. Each
page is heaped with photographs and drawings to illustrate an
amazing world we recognize but don't understand.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Pegasus'' (Morrow, $16) retold by Marianna Mayer;
illustrated by K.Y. Craft. The art, oil over watercolor, captures
the drama and loveliness of this Greek myth urging man to live in
harmony with nature. Mayer expertly retells the story with
compassion and spirit. It's important that children know the real
myths, not just the TV and movie versions.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Cats'' (Kingfisher, $15.95) by Amanda O'Neill. This book
will capture many hours away from the TV. Good. For a cat lover or
a new kitten owner, O'Neill covers cats from myths and magic to
teeth and claws. In typical Kingfisher fashion, illustrations,
photographs and graphics help distribute all this information.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Circus: an Album'' (DK Publishing, $19.95) by Linda
Granfield. Also a nonfiction book for the whole family, ``Circus''
packs facts, photographs, old posters and lore into a tantalizing
look at the big top. P.T. Barnum once said, ``As long as there are
children, there will always be a circus.'' This book feeds the
fascination.
</P>
<P>
   Bon voyage.

EMERGENCIES EXPLODE ON JULY FOURTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Firecracker warnings have become as much a part of the Fourth of
July as the glare of rockets bursting in the hot night air.
</P>
<P>
   But tummy troubles, scrapes, sprains, bug bites, sunburns and
dehydration are even more likely than bottle rockets or Roman
candles to mar July Fourth celebrations for young children.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital emergency rooms still treat patients of all ages who
have been seriously injured by fireworks, most of them set off by
amateurs, but more families today heed the warnings and let the
professionals handle the fireworks displays, put on by hundreds of
municipalities and organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see fingers torn off by fireworks and burns and wounds to
faces,'' says Dr. Ronald Charles, assistant professor of emergency
medicine at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at
Dallas. ``Clothes can catch on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most serious injuries involve eyes damaged by hot,
burnt-out sparklers, usually considered the safest of fireworks for
children to handle. Also, explosive noises can cause permanent
hearing loss, especially when they are being thrown and explode
near the ear, Charles notes.
</P>
<P>
   Still more common are the all-American boo-boos _ skinned knees,
sunburns, upset stomachs, bug bites and heat complaints _ that
never make it to the emergency room, but can spoil outdoor
activities, says Dr. Paula Elbirt, assistant clinical professor of
pediatrics at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Elbirt maintains a Web site (www.drpaula.com), and says she
often answers questions until 2 or 3 a.m. from parents eager to
keep their children happy, healthy and out of harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   ``July Fourth is the single most busy day of the year for most
pediatric emergency centers,'' Elbirt says. ``We need to address a
wide variety of concerns to keep our children safe and make the
Fourth of July a fun day.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, picnics, barbecues and too many star-spangled
treats spell belly bummers, ranging from common indigestion to food
poisoning. Children may vomit once from too much candy, and the
problem can be solved with plenty of clear liquids and some
children's Mylanta, but if there is fever, rampant diarrhea or
repeated vomiting, the illness should be considered a medical
emergency, Elbirt says.
</P>
<P>
   She recommends a first-aid kit for every outing. For prevention,
it should include a sunscreen with a sun protection factor of 30
and an insect repellent containing DEET.
</P>
<P>
   For treatment, pack adhesive bandages, an ice pack, antibiotic
cream, antihistamine cream such as Benadryl, hydrocortisone, a
lotion to soothe sunburn, tweezers and epinephrine for
life-threatening allergic reactions.
</P>
<P>
   Wine-fortified: The latest dietary supplement, hyped this
summer, is a multiformula vitamin-mineral supplement ``pumped up''
with red wine, green tea and garlic.
</P>
<P>
   Radiance includes a full complement of vitamins and minerals
(including time-released forms of the water-soluble vitamins B and
C for a more prolonged benefit from once-a-day dosing), plus herbs
and ``support components'' such as co-enzyme Q10 and Pycnogenol
(antioxidants), chromium picolinate (to boost metabolism and lower
cholesterol) and ginseng (to enhance energy and improve physical
performance).
</P>
<P>
   The garlic is identified as ``an herb many people have included
in their overall regimen,'' and the red wine and green tea extracts
are included ``for their antioxidant properties.''

`GONE WITH THE WIND' RE-RELEASE IS TOP DRAWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there was any lingering doubt after the spectacular
theatrical return of the ``Star Wars'' trilogy, the success of the
recent re-release of ``Grease'' should cinch it: the ``first-run''
re-release is going to be a regular feature of the new movie
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   With no new production costs involved and the possibility of a
big payoff at the box-office, the risk of a few restored prints and
a modest ad campaign seems irresistible to the studios. And even if
the re-release flops _ as did last year's ``The Godfather'' _ the
inevitable media hoopla (critics love old movies) promotes the
video re-release.
</P>
<P>
   So in the months and years ahead, we can expect a special
anniversary edition or a director's cut of some great golden oldie
almost every month or so. This weekend we have two: the
technologically retooled edition of 1939's ``Gone With the Wind''
and the director's cut of 1975's ``Picnic at Hanging Rock.''
</P>
<P>
   ``GWTW'' is, of course, a film that needs no introduction. For
the past 59 years, producer David Selznick's adaptation of Margaret
Mitchell's epic civil war novel has been universally regarded as
the high point of the Golden Age of Hollywood, and the phenomenon
of movie phenomenons, with enough books written about it to fill a
Carnegie library.
</P>
<P>
   It's simply the most popular, most beloved film of all time. In
fact, it was estimated back in the mid-1950s that the total number
of tickets sold for ``GWTW'' was more than the then-population of
the United States. In inflation-adjusted dollars, it far
outdistances its new competitor, ``Titanic'' _ and probably always
will.
</P>
<P>
   The film is also (and this does not necessarily follow from the
above statistics) a genuinely great film, a shattering masterpiece
that just sweeps an audience up and carries it to a different
place. It's been at the top of every critical poll ever taken of
the ``greatest films of all time'' _ even the most snooty European
ones. (Last week's AFI poll put it at number 4.)
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, ``Gone With the Wind'' is the movie that wrote
the book on first-run re-releases. It's enjoyed a successful
national theater re-release in every decade since its debut (except
the '80s, when it finally went to video). Each one of these runs,
in inflation-adjusted dollars, is comparable to the re-issued
``Star Wars'' grosses.
</P>
<P>
   The speculation in the movie trade press is that it could happen
again in the '90s _ despite the film's advanced age and daunting
222-minute running time. The AFI's vote of confidence will help,
and it could be the public's appetite for epic historical romances
has been whetted by ``Titanic,'' which, you may recall, Janet
Maslin of the New York Times dubbed the ``GWTW'' of our time.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the film again for the first time in decades, it
seems almost too good to be true, and certainly superior to
``Titanic'' in every department. It has a script of shocking
subtlety and intelligence, characters of amazing complexity and
depth, movie star performances (Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh, Olivia
de Havilland) of dizzying power and production design so epic and
thrilling it actually gives one goosebumps. It's a love story that
captures a huge chunk of American history in one rapturous,
operatic gulp. It's magic.
</P>
<P>
   The sound on this new print has been digitally reproduced for
greater clarity, and the color has been fully restored (using the
old Technicolor die transfer printing process). Unlike the film's
more recent theatrical revivals in the '60s and '70s, the 1998
``GWTW'' will also be presented in its original aspect ratio of
1:33X1. It's never looked better or sounded so good. Don't miss it.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's second welcome return is ``Picnic at Hanging
Rock,'' Peter Weir's 1975 Australian classic _ adapted from a novel
by Joan Lindsay, but supposedly based on a true story _ about a
trio of schoolgirls and their teacher who inexplicably vanish from
the face of the earth one summer day on a school picnic, circa
1901.
</P>
<P>
   This revival, which is playing one week only at the Varsity, is
being billed as the ``director's cut,'' but instead of the usual
addition of new footage this revised cut has actually lost six
minutes from its original 110-minute running time. Reportedly,
these are a handful of trims here and there to tighten scenes and
speed up the pacing.
</P>
<P>
   The first of Weir's metaphysical masterpieces (the others
include ``The Last Wave,'' and the current Jim Carrey hit, ``The
Truman Show''), ``Picnic'' is one of the great films of the '70s
and a one-of-a-kind experience: a haunting, unsettling drama that
eerily communicates the idea that _ just on the other side of the
ordinary _ there is a vast, unknowable, perhaps malevolent
dimension of existence.
</P>
<P>

`THE LAND GIRLS' NEEDS A LITTLE DIRT UNDER ITS FINGERNAILS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What is it about wartime that makes us get all weepy and
sentimental and forget our morals and obligations? Films about
illicit love affairs during battle evoke such forgiving responses
in audiences and filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Think back on John Schlesinger's ``Yanks,'' about the women who
dallied with American soldiers stationed in England, or ``The
English Patient'' and its tale of infidelity _ even the passionate
trysts between Lara and Zhivago in ``Dr. Zhivago'' _ and we're
swept away on a wave of nostalgia and feelings of hope in the face
of death.
</P>
<P>
   The same chin-up nobility and sacrifice wafts through David
Leland's ``The Land Girls,'' partly because the film is a male
fantasy disguised as female sensibility and partly because it's
such an idealized view of the tranquil English countryside
contrasted against the altered state of reality created by war's
uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   The Women's Land Army was formed in 1917 just at the end of
World War I. It boasted 80,000 members at its peak in the 1940s and
``land girls'' were dispensed to every part of England to fill the
jobs left by the men who went off to battle. Most were volunteers
from every class and walk of life. They worked in factories and on
farms to keep England productive and functioning.
</P>
<P>
   Leland, who also directed ``Wish You Were Here,'' based his
script on a book by Angela Huth and it has some appeal despite
glaring problems. It's 1941 and three gorgeous young ``land girls''
have responded to a call for help on a muddy, industrious milk farm
in a remote part of Dorset. Stella (Catherine McCormack) has a
fiance who is in the navy; Ag (Rachel Weisz) is a no-nonsense
Cambridge-bred intellectual and a virgin at 26, and Prue (Anna
Friel) is a flirty hairdresser intent on making the best of a rough
situation.
</P>
<P>
   They're dispatched to the Lawrence farm where Lawrence, his wife
and their son, Joe (Steven Mackintosh), labor to keep the place
afloat. Joe desperately wants to enlist and become a pilot but to
abandon his parents would be fatal to the business. Lawrence at
first disapproves of the ``land girls,'' (``They're not an army,
just an excuse for a lark,'' he says) but soon comes to admire
their uncomplaining willingness to toil and slave in the fields.
</P>
<P>
   They're also willing to bed Joe, who is the only available man
for miles. And this is the most problematic part of the film. The
three women take a tumble with the lucky lad for very distinct
reasons, and since the actresses are good _ as is Mackintosh as the
frustrated son _ they almost make us believe they'd do such a
thing. Still, it's a stretch of the imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the problem is the pacing. The story demands a leisurely
unfolding of character and motivation but everything happens far
too quickly _ and conveniently. But the biggest hurdle is the
sanitized world the land girls have come to inhabit. Even death and
deformity is pretty and glamorous on this farm.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine McCormack and Rachel Weisz, especially, make the very
best of very little. Still, the film belongs to a time in history
that has been romanticized out of proportion for the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Leland goes so far as to show white doves floating through the
landscape as a symbol of the peaceful nature and patriotism of the
English. Everyone in ``The Land Girls'' pitches in to make this
cinematic view a scrupulously serene, lush and clean guilty
pleasure that, in all truth, could have used lots more dirt under
its fingernails.
</P>
<P>

Dewhurst, Leland. Cast: Catherine McCormack, Rachel Weisz, Anna

`COUSIN BETTE' UNFAITHFUL TO ORIGINAL BALZAC SOURCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even allowing for the major changes that are always necessary
when a great novel is adapted to the screen, the screenplay for
this rather dismal version of Balzac's 1846 novel, ``Cousin
Bette,'' seems strikingly unfaithful to its source:
</P>
<P>
   _ Balzac's entire back story of how Baron Hector Hulot d'Ervy
(Hugh Laurie) ruined his family's reputation and fortune via a
series of scandals is omitted, so the movie has no context. Also
missing is Hector's primary motivation _ to marry one of his
kitchen maids.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hector's wife, Adeline (Geraldine Chaplin) is killed off in
the first scene of the movie, while in the novel she's a major
character, lusted after by Crevel (Bob Hoskins), often conspiring
with her husband's many mistresses, and the drama's one figure of
dignity and sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Josepha, a young Jewish singer in the Opera and a minor
character in the novel, has been combined with the character of
Madam Valerie Marneffe and elevated into a major character who is
not in the novel at all, Jenny Cadine (Elisabeth Shue).
</P>
<P>
   _ Hector's son, Victorin (Toby Stephens), another character in
the novel with some dignity and resourcefulness, is burlesqued and
turned into a fool; Crevel doesn't have a wife and doesn't die of a
mysterious illness.
</P>
<P>
   _ And so on and on.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing the movie takes from Balzac is the central
plot line in which Hector's old maid cousin, Bette (Jessica Lange),
seeks revenge on her relatives after her beloved _ a young Polish
sculptor (Aden Young) _ marries Hector's niece, Hortense (Kelly
Macdonald).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, such a wholesale reworking of a classic would barely
be noticed if it led to some happy cinematic end. But the changes
have only served to broaden and vulgarize the characters, destroy
the novel's uniquely satisfying sense of texture, and so muddle up
the storyline that it's hard to figure out exactly what's happening
at any one time.
</P>
<P>
   First-time movie director (but Broadway heavyweight) Des McAnuff
seems to have gone less for the subtlety and depth of Balzac's
``Comedie Humaine'' than for its characters' occasional
extravagance and for a rapid, almost dizzying pace _ so his film
feels like a ``Masterpiece Theater'' episode run at fast-forward
speed.
</P>
<P>
   Lange is suitably malevolent and passive-aggressive as the title
character, Aden Young is quite funny as the self-obsessed sculptor
and Bob Hoskins supplies a touch of humanity as Crevel. Elisabeth
Shue, with her flat, inexpressive, prototypically American voice
seems to have taken a wrong turn from the ``Leaving Las Vegas''
set.
</P>
<P>
   Cousin Bette. Directed by Des McAnuff. Produced by Sarah
Radclyffe. Screenplay by Lynn Siefert and Susan Tarr. Cast: Jessica
Lange, Elisabeth Shue, Hugh Laurie, Bob Hoskins. Fox Searchlight.
108 minutes. Rated R for sexual situations and nudity.

INSPIRATIONAL SUCCESS STORIES MAY CHALLENGE READER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA McUSIC 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the hot summer sun takes its toll on our body and spirits,
some of us may need a little inspiration. So get something cool to
drink, find a pool (even the inflatable kind) and pick up a copy of
``Unstoppable: 45 Powerful Stories of Perseverance and Triumph from
People Just Like You'' (Sourcebooks, 316 pages, $12.95).
</P>
<P>
   The book is similar in type to the bestselling Chicken Soup for
the Soul series, but richer in detail and fact. I always wondered
if I was reading a true story when I looked at a Chicken Soup book,
and I'm not sure that it was the authors' point to tell one. They
may have just been looking for an illustrative story to match their
ideas of a meaningful life.
</P>
<P>
   But in ``Unstoppable,'' there is little doubt as to the validity
of the stories. For one thing, many of them are about well-known
people and businesses, such as Millard and Linda Fuller, the
founders of Habitat for Humanity; or Paul Orfalea, founder of
Kinko's; or Anita Roddick, founder of The Body Shop.
</P>
<P>
   All have amazing stories of overcoming major obstacles that were
seemingly unsurmountable, yet these people persevered and created
something impressively useful, generally in markets totally missed
by corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the story of Maria Ilena Ibanez, a native of Colombia
who earned a computer engineering degree in the United States
during the 1970s. After graduation, she saw a tremendous market for
personal computers in Latin America, where prices for personal
computers were 10 times what they were in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But all the major U.S. computer companies turned her down,
saying that Latin Americans were poor and couldn't afford even the
cheaper models. Finally, she told Altos Computers that she would
sell $10,000 of their products in a year and the company gave her a
distribution agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In just three weeks, using the Yellow Pages as her sole source
of contacts, she came back to the United States with $100,000 worth
of orders in the form of cashier's checks.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next five years, sales at her company, International
Micro Systems, grew to $15 million. By 1988, when Ibanez sold the
company, sales had reached $70 million.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly resting on her laurels, Ibanez is doing the same thing in
Africa. Her new company's sales have averaged $13 million in the
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Ibanez's advice?
</P>
<P>
   ``When you encounter a hurdle _ and I do that every week _ view
it as an opportunity, not the end of the world,'' she says in the
book. ``Do whatever you need to do to get past it quickly. If you
believe in your dream, you'll definitely get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Another woman featured, Sharlyne Powell, developed an exercise
class for overweight women, a market of about 60 million in the
United States. Despite being met with disdain by the fitness
industry, Powell developed the Women at Large fitness clubs and has
sold thousands of fitness videos.
</P>
<P>
   Powell is quoted in the book: ``I haven't done anything anybody
else can't do if they find something that truly inspires them. It
will require taking some risks and possibly subjecting yourself to
ridicule and ignorance. There's always a price. But if you push
through, you can go places you never dreamed you could go.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all stories in the book concern business. One is about a
woman who started writing encouraging notes to ill children after
the death of her son and has developed a booming, but nonprofit,
volunteer service reaching thousands of kids.
</P>
<P>
   Another story tells of an African boy who left his village with
no money, but a dream of attending college in the United States.
Legson Kayira is now a widely acclaimed author and professor of
political science at Cambridge University.
</P>
<P>
   His advice: ``I learned I was not, as most Africans believed,
the victim of my circumstances, but the master of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Author Cynthia Kersey, who has launched several companies and
tours the country speaking on fulfilling careers, has identified
seven characteristics of ``unstoppable people'' and devotes a
chapter to each.
</P>
<P>
   Such people, she says:
</P>
<P>
   _ Devote themselves to their true purpose.
</P>
<P>
   _ Follow their heart's passion.
</P>
<P>
   _ Believe in themselves and their ideas.
</P>
<P>
   - Prepare for challenges.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ask for help and build a support team.
</P>
<P>
   _ Seek creative solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Persevere, no matter what the challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stories of these unstoppable dreamers awaken in us our own
potential to dream again, to act on those dreams, and see them
through to the finish line,'' she writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They illustrate that anyone _ no matter how difficult their
circumstances _ can achieve their goals and overcome any obstacle,
if only they will commit themselves to doing so. The qualities that
assured their success are qualities that can be learned and
developed by anyone with the will to do so.''

ASHLAND SHAKESPEARE FESTIVAL HAS GROWN INTO A SLICK, MODERN EVENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOE ADCOCK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASHLAND, Ore. _ What started out in 1933 as a shrine of
nostalgic amateurism is now America's premiere destination resort
for innovative theatrical professionalism.
</P>
<P>
   The Oregon Shakespeare Festival used to be quaint and cozy, the
ultimate West Coast Renaissance Faire. Now the festival is
cosmopolitan and diverse, slick and contemporary.
</P>
<P>
   Gone this year is the last vestige of Ye Olde Ashland: dancers
in Elizabethan costumes who cavorted nightly in exhibitions of
antique choreography.
</P>
<P>
   Festival artistic director Libby Appel has replaced them with
modern dance viruosi in sleek unitards. Their work gives a flashy
choreographic preview of themes from that evening's mainstage play.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, her second season as head of the festival, Appel
fired long-time Ashland director Pat Patton. He is now artistic
director of the Tacoma Actors Guild. Patton specialized in
museum-quality productions with actors in full Elizabethan regalia
declaiming in a mid-century Stratford-on-Avon or Stratford,
Ontario, festival style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time the festival has made a change over the years,
there has been an angry outcry from a few people,'' Appel says.
``When the policy of casting fully professional actors began in
earnest there were protests: `They've destroyed everything the
festival stands for! It's supposed to be community theater!' But
the festival has been growing and changing from the start.''
</P>
<P>
   Appel finds vindication in numbers. The festival audience is
getting bigger. Last year set a record attendance of 364,602, the
highest for any American non-profit theater. ``And the way things
are going, it looks as if we may set another record this season,''
Appel says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as if Elizabethan costumes are now forbidden. It's
just that they are generally not part of our directors' vision of
Shakespeare in America.''
</P>
<P>
   And so this season the festival is offering ``Midsummer Night's
Dream'' in a Dickensian surrealist mode, ``Henry IV, Part One'' as
a metal dude's excellent adventure, ``A Comedy of Errors'' as a
crazy costume caper, ``Measure for Measure'' as a modern
psychodrama (directed by Appel), and ``Cymbeline'' as a fairytale.
</P>
<P>
   That's the Shakespeare component of the festival. Also featured
are an 18th-century English farce by Richard Brinsley Sheridan, a
19th-century Russian drama by Anton Chekhov and plays by four
20th-century Americans: Eugene O'Neill, Sandra Deer, Lorraine
Hansberry and Ernest Joselovitz.
</P>
<P>
   Rebellion is rife throughout the 1998 repertory. Rebels arise in
medieval Britain and Lithuania, in 20th-century Ireland and Africa,
and even in timeless terrains of fairytale and myth.
</P>
<P>
   First some short reviews of works by that noted playwright
William Shakespeare, 17th-century celebrity and the abiding genius
behind Ashland's 20th-century boomtown legend:
</P>
<P>
   _ A Midsummer Night's Dream. Director Penny Metropolous'
production is total dream: It glides from unnerving nightmare to
erotic fantasia to absurd hallucination. The result is marvelous.
</P>
<P>
   At least the conception and the design are marvelous. Some of
the acting is so vehement that it tatters the subtle vision.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Seattle actor G. Valmont Thomas brings extreme clowning
to bear on the part of Thisbe, the farcical-tragical heroine of a
play within the play. The result is hilarious. Thisbe's sweety,
Pyramus, is played by another dextrous clown, David Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas and Kelly are part of an excellently done low-life plot.
The high-life plot _ romantic foibles among the well-born _ is less
interestingly acted. And the supernatural plot _ jealous
manipulations and hissy fits amongst opposing gangs of fairies _ is
only a little more nuanced.
</P>
<P>
   But the look and feel of this show is what makes it marvelous. A
set by William Bloodgood, with doors 20 feet off the ground opening
out of oddly angled walls, instantly makes unreality real. From
time to time, frantic characters find themselves trapped in a
plexiglass phone booth ... that has no phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alice in Wonderland'' costumes, enhanced by some beyond-punk
gravity-defying wigs, are surreal, as are wild lighting effects and
dreamy musical moments (costumes by Deborah Trout, lights by Ann G.
Wrightson and sound by Jeremy J. Lee).
</P>
<P>
   _ Henry IV, Part One. Director Michael Donald Edwards' take on
this medieval action adventure drama looks like slackers from the
Crocodile Cafe joining forces with suits from the Rainier Club and
heading off for a military mop up of the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The effect is sensational, even if the theme _ nothing like
violence to turn an effete punk into a real man _ is dispiriting.
The hand-to-hand combat, devised by fight director John Sipes, is
spectacular, as are special battle effects contrived by set
designer William Bloodgood and lighting designer Derek Duarte. The
final scenes look like the worst of times in Kosovo or Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   In the central role (a prince who goes from dissolute to
resolute), Dan Donohue makes the implausible seem at least vivid.
Early scenes, outfitted by David Zinn, look like Halloween on
Capitol Hill. Then come scenes that look like a Pentagon show of
the latest looks in mass murder attire.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle audiences may remember actor John Pribyl as a sort of
Marlboro Man who performed at various theaters 10 or 15 years ago.
Pribyl is now an Ashland regular. In a much-padded costume, he
plays a desperately dissolute old hippie, Sir John Falstaff by
name. Pribyl drolly orchestrates the slacker gang's frolics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry IV, Part One'' was presumably inspiring and patriotic
400 years ago. Now it is cynical and disheartening. However, the
play's world-weary presentation of male bonding as a curse benefits
in this production from gorgeous, garish visuals.
</P>
<P>
   _ A Comedy of Errors. Director Kenneth Albers' spectacular
production is so giddy and gaudy that one almost forgets that the
characters are superhumanly stupid.
</P>
<P>
   One of Shakespeare's earliest plays (1594 or thereabouts), ``A
Comedy of Errors'' features two sets of twins, separated at birth.
After about a dozen mistaken identity incidents, you'd think the
four long-lost brothers would put two and two together. But
thinking is definitely not in their bags of tricks.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the various bags of tricks are brimming with goodies.
Albers would seem to be a long-lost Flying Karamazov Brother _ the
one who got all the money. His costume budget is huge. Never before
have so many sequins, fringes, feathers, ribbons, beads and
irridescent everythings been brought together in one place at one
time (costumes by Charles Berliner).
</P>
<P>
   The whole cast clowns madly. Two of the brothers are played by
women, which is novel. Amid the explosions, tumbles and supposedly
comic beatings, one bit of shtick stands out: Terrilynn Towns, as
an eligible bachelorette, clowns with her eyes. They flit wildly,
denoting everything from guilty conscience to innocent lust.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cymbeline. With reason, this Celtic/Roman mishmash of a
fairytale is rarely produced. ``Cymbeline'' is largely a matter
nonsensical people doing nonsensical things. Not only are the
people nonsensical, they are also tiresome. And their nonsensical
doings are boring.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the main character, Imogen, is nicely played by Jodi
Somers. Though Imogen is a sort of combination Snow White,
Goldilocks and Sleeping Beauty, Somers makes the girl's peculiar
behavior pass as youthful passion. Also, Somers speaks loudly and
clearly and expressively.
</P>
<P>
   The plot is absurd. Along the way, true love proves false but
not really and invading Roman legions are defeated by the dotty
King Cymbeline, but they can be friends, anyway. The incidents are
as convoluted and contrived as the Celtic knot patterns with which
designer Richard L. Hay profusely festoons the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Ashland's mandate extends beyond Shakespeare to include works _
classic, modern and contemporary _ that might be called
Shakespearean: ``large in scale and rich in language,'' as the
festival's mission statement puts it.
</P>
<P>
   Among the non-Shakespeare works included in this year's festival
are the following:
</P>
<P>
   _ Vilna's Got a Golem, by Ernest Joselovitz. This is a
fantastic, wonderful play. But unless you dash off to Ashland right
this very minute, you will not see it. It closes on Saturday to
make room for ``Measure for Measure.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe some adventurous Seattle company will produce it.
``Vilna's Got a Golem'' raises issues that are both primordial and
immediate. It is about, so to speak, the kid who takes a gun to
school, the third world country that gets the bomb and the ethnic
cleansers who are at work everywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   It is also about Jews in Europe in 1540 and in 1899. A Jewish
theatrical troupe in Vilna is putting on a play about a about a
Medieval legend, a secret weapon, a killing machine that should
stop pogroms once and for all. As ethnic satire, the show indicts
both Israel's tough-guy policies and assimilated American Jews'
nice-guy, secularist culture.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Barbara Damashek, the drama is at once playful and
horrifying. Peppy klezmer (traditional Jewish dance band) music by
Damashek is performed by an on-stage trio. Joselovitz's achievement
is in the style of the 20th century German theatrical revolutionary
Bertolt Brecht. ``Vilna's Got a Golem'' combines tragedy and ``just
kidding'' reassurances. As Brecht insisted, such a style is
entertaining. But it precludes escape. It makes you think.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vilna's Got a Golem'' makes you think.
</P>
<P>
   _ Uncle Vanya. Libby Appel's staging of this comedy drama by
Anton Chekhov is like a string of firecrackers with a long fuse.
After about 90 minutes of anticipation, the characters explode one
by one _ bang, bang, bang. Actually, the title character goes off
with two bangs.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Elmore is an unusually combustible Vanya. The other
characters seem to become inflamed by his chafing agitation.
</P>
<P>
   The play focuses on a family and their visitors. They are cooped
up in a country house, Russia, summer, late 19th century. Desire
and desperation are in the air. Frustration and fear are on the
ground. The tedium is sometimes tedious.
</P>
<P>
   Appel uses a sleek adaptation by American playwright Jean-Claude
van Italie. The show's only linguistic eccentricity is an arch
English accent used by one of the actors.
</P>
<P>
   Helping to build tension are little visual emblems before each
of the four acts: Vanya asleep atop a grand piano; a wine bottle
and a bucket to catch the rain that comes through a leaky roof; a
bouquet of roses; a map of Africa. Set designer Robert Brill and
lighting designer Robert Peterson help Appel to create a
loaded-and-ready-to-explode atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   _ The School for Scandal. Richard Brinsley Sheridan's 1777
satirical farce is at least more stylish than a two-and-a-half hour
CNN wrap-up of the latest Washington sex 'n' chicanery scandals.
</P>
<P>
   But the talk of London two centuries ago was so similar to
contemporary twaddle that Ashland director Lillian Garrett-Groag's
extremely elegant production might be an enactment of an
extraordinarily well-written edition of People magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Brown's costumes are as fancy as can be, as are settings
by Richard L. Hay.
</P>
<P>
   Sheridan's caricatures, however, are only ludicrous if they are
preposterous. And just now they are not. They are more like
unflinching realism, an expose of hypocrisy, hoaky news leaks and
rampant malice among the high and mighty.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett-Groag finds funny things for a platoon of servants to
do. The menials' clowning is at least an improvement over the long
faces presented in interviews with White House underlings.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes timeliness works in favor of a revival. But this
``School for Scandal'' is too timely: CNN with hoop skirts and
three-cornered hats.

<P>
   _ Les Blancs. In 1970, this dramatization by Lorraine Hansberry
of African nationalist independence struggles was written off as a
ploddingly literal confrontation between one-dimensional
categories. The one-dimensional categories and the plodding are
still there. But now, nearly every line of ``Les Blancs'' tinkles
with unintended irony.
</P>
<P>
   Hansberry, though living in a time of dirty little wars in Asia
and Latin America, understood and maybe even condoned
anti-imperialist violence in Africa. The actors representing
independence fighters have heroic lines and in Ashland, anyway,
they also have heroic physiques.
</P>
<P>
   But these warrior's faith in ethnic cleansing is anti-heroic in
1998. Starting with a glance at Ruanda and Burundi, circling around
central Africa, and then widening the focus to include the whole
world, one sees very little justification for hatred and violence
other than historical inevitability.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Les Blancs,'' white liberalism, white humanitarianism and
white imperialism; black anti-imperialism, black moderation and
black ambivalence all have their say before historical
inevitability takes over. Director Tim Bond (former artistic
director at the Group Theatre in Seattle) gives ``Les Blancs'' full
honors. The 17 performers are desperately committed to bringing
their respective categories to life. But that commitment is about
as futile as bringing dramatic life to a philosophical dialogue by
Plato.
</P>
<P>
   Jungle outpost settings by Richard L. Hay, costumes by Helen
Qizhi Huang and lighting by Dawn Chiang are all spectacular efforts
to transfuse vitality into a lifeless political tract.
</P>
<P>
   Hansberry is remembered as the author of ``A Raisin in the
Sun,'' which was funny and dramatic and righteous. ``Raisin'' was a
huge success in 1959, when Hansberry was 28. A few unpopular
Hansberry plays, including ``Les Blancs,'' followed.
</P>
<P>
   Hansberry died in 1965. Till the end of her short life, she was
annoyed by the question, ``Why doesn't Lorraine write another
`Raisin'?'' One can understand her annoyance. But one can also
understand why the question came up.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sailing to Byzantium. Playwright Sandra Deer mixes civility
and barbarity, senimentality and harshness in this highly literary
drama about the highly literary.
</P>
<P>
   Questions of taste arise: Are the the horrors of World War I and
the Easter 1916 nationalist rebellion in Dublin thrown in as
picante seasoning for insipid incidents and characters? Are famous
and semi-famous and almost famous personages _ poets Ezra Pound and
William Butler Yeats, Irish revolutonary Maud Gonne and novelist
Olivia Shakespear _ exploited to give celebrity sensation to banal
relationships?
</P>
<P>
   I found the show mildly interesting but vaguely distasteful.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain, the word ``love'' is spoken as often in
this two-hour play as it is sung in two hours of top 40 pop music
radio. And unrequited love, hopeless love and abusive love are as
prevalent as they are at a country music concert.
</P>
<P>
   Director Chris Coleman's staging of ``Sailing to Byzantium'' is
elegant. All the actors perform fiercely. Linda Alper as Maud Gonne
sings a beautiful bit of an Irish martyrdom ballad. And James
Edmondson, as a staunch and stuffy Englishman, is a refreshing
zephyr in Deer's emotional hot house.
</P>

WALTER LIKES WESTPHAL, BUT NOT LABOR STRIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a guy who thinks UCLA remains the center of the universe,
Bill Walton's willingness to even talk about ex-Trojan Paul
Westphal is, for him, a considerable descent from the mount.
</P>
<P>
   Then to offer him a compliment, well ... will boiling oceans and
flaming skies be next?
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how much integrity he has?'' Walton said. ``He turned
down John Wooden.''
</P>
<P>
   In Walton's mind, Westphal did the unimaginable. As a
well-regarded prepster from Aviation High in Los Angeles in the
late 1960s, Westphal chose USC over UCLA, where he could have
studied under the coaching legend, not to mention teaming with
Walton for a season.
</P>
<P>
   But Westphal also would have had to share the ball with stars
Sidney Wicks, Curtis Rowe and Steve Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wooden would have made him dump the ball inside to those big
guys,'' Walton said. ``Paul wanted to shoot. So he went to USC and
established their program.''
</P>
<P>
   To the point where in Westphal's junior season of 1971, formerly
bedraggled USC found itself the nation's fifth-ranked team with a
24-2 record, 12-2 in the Pac-8.
</P>
<P>
   You know who provided the two losses. The 29-1 Bruins were the
national champions, so Walton needed only to chuckle over the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   He was, however, quick to overlook that shortcoming in assessing
Westphal's latest basketball decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hiring Paul is a terrific move for the Sonics,'' Walton said.
``As a player, he was visionary, one of the most skilled and
creative offensive players in the game. Same with his coaching. The
players will love playing for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Walton has been in the area all week as a principal speaker at
the annual Seafirst Jammin' Hoops Camp, including the Seattle
portion tomorrow at Garfield High School. The free sessions, which
last year drew 6,300 kids around the state, feature current and
former NBA players, including Nate McMillan and Sam Perkins, who
hang out and talk about making good decisions in hoops and in life.
</P>
<P>
   Walton has been a part of the popular one-day fests since they
began in 1990 with the encouragement of former Sonic staffer (and
another ex-Trojan) Jim Marsh, now with Seafirst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim and Paul,'' Walton said, laughing, ``are the only Trojans
I associate with.''
</P>
<P>
   The camp is another way for Walton, a member of the Hall of Fame
as well as NBA champions in Portland and Boston, to feed his
basketball jones.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate as he might look on NBC's telecasts, where his
disarming honesty remains refreshing, Walton still aches to swap
elbows in the paint.
</P>
<P>
   ``(NBA players) have the greatest lives in the world,'' he said.
``And I've been fortunate to be coached by six Hall of Fame
coaches. When you are touched like that, life is never the same
again. You try to chase that the rest of your life, trying to make
that happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven years removed from his playing days, which were shortened
to nine seasons by injuries, Walton has a particularly hard time
accepting the idea that Michael Jordan is seriously considering
retirement for no good reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Play as long as you can,'' he said. ``You can play only a
short time in your life. I don't believe his stature will be
diminished at all if he keeps playing ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he wins, people feel good for him, and that kind of
feeling is what sports entertainment is all about. People like
Jordan, John Lennon, Jerry Garcia, Mozart . . . these are people
who can provide joy, enthusiasm and hope that the world is a great
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally foolish is the potential breakup of the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so hard to win a championship,'' he said. ``It's the
greatest feeling in the world. It never leaves you. If (players and
management) trade that opportunity away for money, they will learn
a very hard lesson in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael already learned it once.''
</P>
<P>
   A harder lesson will be learned by the entire industry next week
when, as expected, the NBA locks out its players in order to force
changes in the collective bargaining agreement _ a decision that
has the potential to be a calamitous act of self-destruction, given
the growth of the NBA's global popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of really rich people dividing up a pie,'' Walton
said. ``The biggest advantage the NBA has is that the games have
become special events that fans want to be part of. Anytime you do
anything to jeopardize that trust, you risk losing the advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NBA has special players and teams that when you watch them
play, it's never about money. It's about the joy of basketball. If
that feeling can be kept, instead of falling down into the gutter
of labor and money, the game is going to be so much better.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony of the moment is that Walton, who as a player was one
of the most marvelously gifted expressions of team-game
selflessness, is spending a week here giving a little more, while
the game that grew him is on the verge of taking much away.
</P>
<P>
   Hard to convince kids to stay out of the gutter when their
heroes roll in it.

CHEFS TRADE CHAOTIC RESTAURANTS FOR GROCERY STORES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Dave Hamlin has worked side by side with some of
the top chefs in the country. As an alum of the esteemed Culinary
Institute of America, Hamlin refers to these men and women as his
peers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when Hamlin graduated from the Hyde Park, N.Y., school in
1991, he took a job as a food service specialist with Price Chopper
supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for a quality of life change,'' explained
Hamlin, 37, who is married with two daughters. ``I didn't want to
be a slave to a saute pan for 80 hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting home at one or two in the morning after working 12
hours in a kitchen does not promote a healthy family life,'' he
added. ``What I was looking for was a job that would challenge me
without completely consuming me.''
</P>
<P>
   Little did Hamlin know that he was at the forefront of a
nationwide trend. More and more grocery stores are turning to
first-class chefs as they battle head-to-head with restaurants for
a public increasingly eager for quality take-out lunches and
dinners.
</P>
<P>
   While Hamlin was the second CIA graduate hired by the Golub
Corp., which has Price Chopper stores in five states, the company
has been actively adding chefs to its staff. There are now more
than a dozen culinary school graduates overseeing the deli
departments and fresh-meal stations at Price Choppers, as well as
another eight to 10 interns from the culinary program at the
Schenectady County Community College in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   Hamlin, now corporate program development specialist for Price
Chopper, created the Roasters, Bella Roma and Coyote Joe's sections
that are highly visible in many of the stores.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two months he has been working at a frantic pace on
the redesign of a Price Chopper in Glens Falls, N.Y., targeted as
the company's new flagship store.
</P>
<P>
   Steve McKee, director of food service for Golub and an '86 CIA
graduate who spent the last 12 years as director of purchasing at
the CIA, is working with Hamlin on the project.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Golub has been combing restaurants to recruit
chefs who may not have the CIA on their resume, but have proved
themselves with years of practical experience.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent study by the Food Marketing Institute, the
number of shoppers who purchase prepared food from a supermarket to
eat at home (known in the industry as HMR, or home-meal
replacement) has doubled in the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   And this trend is exploding. The FMI survey found 22 percent of
consumers bought ready-made food from grocery stores last year,
nearly double the 12 percent who did so in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   From a chef's perspective, the supermarket doesn't have the same
ring as a gourmet cafe or trattoria, but the pluses far outweigh
whatever ego is attached to the image of an eatery.
</P>
<P>
   Stability is another factor. The prospects for an independent
restaurant are bleak; more than half fold within their first year.
</P>
<P>
   The marriages between supermarkets and chefs appear to be a
perfect match on the onset of the next century mostly because it
fits both parties' needs. The supermarkets need culinary experts as
the traditional grocery store morphs into a take-out restaurant,
and chefs are eager to have a life as well as a career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally feel like I could get married now, but a
relationship was a hard thing to juggle when you're a chef at a
restaurant,'' said John Mazzacco, a former restaurant chef in the
Troy, N.Y., who now works for Price Chopper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I have a personal life and my life has changed for the
better, without a doubt,'' said Mazzacco, 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``For more than eight years I could never spend Mother's Day or
Easter with my mom and dad. Restaurant chefs get one day off a
year, Christmas, and all the other holidays you're working.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quality of life is more important than words can express. You
can't put a price tag on time you can spend with your family.''

CANADA TRYING TO SELL REACTORS CALLED UNSAFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ The country that jump-started India's nuclear weapons
program is aggressively seeking to sell atomic reactors to China,
Turkey and other nations with poor reputations for protecting
either human rights or the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the nuclear reactors that Canada is peddling abroad
are the same models, in basic design, as atomic generators shut
down in Ontario in recent months after being deemed too dangerous
to operate.
</P>
<P>
   The pending $3 billion sale of a pair of reactors to China,
approved by the government but still facing a court challenge by
the Sierra Club, has drawn furious criticism from environmental
groups both in Canada and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ottawa is quietly offering Turkey more than $1 billion in
taxpayer-backed loans in hopes of selling two more reactors, in an
effort to salvage its own government-subsidized and deeply troubled
nuclear industry.
</P>
<P>
   In both deals, the government of Prime Minister Jean Chretien is
refusing to subject the nuclear projects to the same environmental
assessments that Canadian law requires for far smaller
international aid programs.
</P>
<P>
   One ludicrous result: ``Ordinary'' foreign projects funded by
Ottawa, such as the Canadian-sponsored construction of latrines at
a missionary clinic in Bolivia, the building of a fence in Colombia
and startup of rabbit-breeding farms in South Asia, must undergo
much more rigorous environmental reviews than the export of nuclear
reactors capable of producing plutonium and other nuclear weapons
material.
</P>
<P>
   The export sales of nuclear reactors built by a government-owned
corporation, Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., are exempt from review
under a special law hastily pushed through by the Chretien
government in 1996 to speed up the sale to China.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's timing was auspicious. In that year, American companies
were still banned from selling nuclear technology to China because,
according to the CIA, Beijing was providing major assistance to
Pakistan's nuclear weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   Later, President Clinton rescinded the ban, partly because the
nuclear energy lobby in the United States complained that American
companies were losing multi-billion dollar sales to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's reactors, named Candu, for Canadian Deuterium Uranium,
are reputed internationally to be easier to build than competing
models sold by American, German and French firms. But the Candu
reactor is so difficult to operate that over the past year, Ontario
Hydro, North America's largest utility company and the employer of
some of the most highly trained nuclear technicians in the world,
has closed seven of its reactors for safety reasons. That
represents a stunning third of the 21 nuclear reactors operating in
Canada, all Candus, a reactor type once regarded as a reliable
world beater but now suffering dismal performance ratings.
</P>
<P>
   The Ontario reactors were dogged by a terrifying series of
leaks, power failures and inadequate monitoring, according to
internal reviews. Candu reactors sold abroad have also suffered
leaks and other serious mishaps.
</P>
<P>
   But the Chretien government claims there is no need for an
environmental assessment in the sale of two 700-megawatt Candu 6
reactors to China because the reactors are safe, China is an
experienced nuclear country and controls are in place to ensure the
reactors will not be used to create weapons.
</P>
<P>
   As for the troubles that forced the closure of the Ontario
reactors, Canadian nuclear officials shrug these off as
``management problems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words, Canadian Candu reactors are perfectly safe to
operate by anyone except highly trained Canadians,'' said Elizabeth
May, executive director of the Sierra Club-Canada. ``In reality,
Canada is showing an appalling contempt for environmental law in
its crazed effort to find foreign markets for reactors that it can
no longer build at home.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club has sued to force the government to complete a
thorough environmental review of the project, as is mandatory for
all other Canadian foreign aid. The suit is expected to go to court
within the next few months despite delaying tactics by Ottawa and
the nuclear industry.
</P>
<P>
   As in the United States, Canada's nuclear industry is
essentially dead, with no new reactors under construction or even
planned for the distant future anywhere in the country. But with
billions of tax dollars invested in the technology, the government
is desperate to find markets in less-developed countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is somewhat comparable to the American chemical companies
that continued to peddle DDT abroad after it was banned at home,''
said Norman Rubin, director of nuclear research for Energy Probe, a
Toronto-based antinuclear group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canada, which prides itself for taking the moral high ground
on issues of peace and diplomacy, is weirdly amoral when it comes
to exporting nuclear tecnology,'' he said. ``The clients for
Canadian Candu reactors are hardly on the list of the most
responsible governments in the world. Military juntas, communist
dictatorships, strongarm leaders _ these are typical Candu
clients.''
</P>
<P>
   The countries that have purchased 14 Canadian reactors over the
past 40 years include India, South Korea, Romania and Argentina,
all of which have less money and technical experience to operate
nuclear systems that have bedeviled Canada's own elite operators.
Later this month, Canada may win a multi-billion dollar, two
reactor contract from Turkey, where Ottawa is in tight competetion
with a US-Japan consortium and a French-German atomic group for the
sale. Ottawa is also courting Indonesia as a future client.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the outcry of anti-nuclear groups, the 1996 sale to
China received little public attention in Canada. Construction work
has already begun on the complex in Qinshan, 75 miles south of
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   That public indifference changed dramatically last month, when
atomic weapons tests in Pakistan and India alerted the world to a
dangerous new arms race in Asia, a race in which Canada has direct,
if inadvertent, complicity.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's first exports of nuclear technology, in the 1950s, were
to India under the so-called ``atoms for peace'' program. India
vowed that it would never use the Canadian reactors for anything
but peaceful purposes.
</P>
<P>
   But India lied. In 1974, the country exploded a nuclear test
device using plutonium from a Canadian-made reactor, by New Delhi's
own admission.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan, meanwhile, launched its civilian nuclear power program
in 1965 with a Canadian-supplied reactor. There is no evidence that
Canada's atomic assistance to Pakistan helped that nation build its
first nuclear weapons, although in 1995 Islamabad made a point of
publicly thanking both Canada and China for getting its nuclear
program underway.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that Canada contributed both technology
and equipment to the escalation of the nuclear armament situation
in India and Pakistan,'' said Alexa McDonough, a member of
Parliament from Nova Scotia and national leader of the New
Democratic Party. ``Canada is going to be one of the countries with
the most blood on its hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa cut nuclear ties to both states in 1976, although
Canadian nuclear experts still provide technical assistance. Atomic
power advocates say that Canada learned a harsh lesson. ``We will
not sell technology to any country that has not signed the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty,'' said Allen Kilpatrick, vice-president
for marketing of Atomic Energy of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Chretien, meanwhile, dismisses the notion that
Canada has any moral responsibility for the nuclear arms race in
South Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``International regulations ... did not exist at the time we did
business with India and Pakistan,'' he said last week.

EARL PROULX: FIXING IT WITH PLAIN TALK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI DOTEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SURRY, N.H. _ Earl Proulx did not set his sights on being a
nationally known columnist. He just wanted to make a decent living
_ something his father, a skilled carpenter and contractor, thought
might be beyond the reach of his middle son.
</P>
<P>
   Proulx proved him wrong. Not only did he make a darn good living
over the years as a supervisor for large contractors, he became the
Monadnock region's answer-man for people seeking solutions to
building problems big or small. Then at age 66, seemingly the
twilight of his career, he parlayed his down-home wisdom into a
successful column called ``Plain Talk'' for Yankee magazine. After
20 years, it's still running.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all began when I was 11 or 12,'' says Proulx, sitting in
his office on the ground floor of the house he built himself in the
1950s. ``I overheard my father telling my brothers that they had to
be prepared to `take care of Earl.' He didn't think I would be able
to make a living because I was born with a club foot. After that my
brothers didn't want anything to do with me. So I became a loner
and spent a lot of time in my bedroom reading.''
</P>
<P>
   He read anything he could find that had anything to do with
building and making things. He would cut out the instructions,
painstakingly arranging clippings in notebooks. Today, Proulx
continues to clip and file, but his routine has been updated a
little by the use of a yellow highlighting marker.
</P>
<P>
   He also has a computer, but don't mention e-mail to this tall
man whose unlined face belies his 85 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hooked up to e-mail,'' says Proulx, dressed in gray
polyester slacks, a white nylon shirt, and patterned tie. ``But I
hate it. It's not personal enough.''
</P>
<P>
   So every Monday, Proulx drives over to Yankee magazine's
headquarters in nearby Dublin in his dark-cherry Oldsmobile and
collects his mail. He gets up to 20 letters a week. Back home, he
organizes them in their appropriate slots _ letters he can answer
off the top of his head go in one slot, queries that need some
research in another, and ones that require a lot of homework go up
top.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started filling these binders with clippings when I was a
kid,'' says Proulx. ``And these books over here help me identify
old tools for readers. This one here is a Sears Roebuck catalog
from 1902. And this one up here is filled with thank-yous from
readers.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything has a place. Nothing is out of order.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been neat,'' he says. ``Even my room as a teenager
was neat. My mother never had to speak to me about picking up my
room. The only thing she disliked was the wooden snake I kept in my
desk drawer.''
</P>
<P>
   And his neatness does not just pertain to his office. His large
workshop, now seldom used, is immaculate. Over the years he has
also collected a treasure-trove of old tools that line the walls. A
painting easel, parked in a corner, has not been touched since his
third wife died 21 years ago. Upstairs the bed is made, the kitchen
picked up, and the dog leashed outside.
</P>
<P>
   Proulx honed his skills, he says, first by working for his
father and then with other contractors. His second marriage
produced a son, who lives in San Diego and has three children. It
was his son and Proulx's third wife who helped him build his dream
house, with its spectacular view of Mount Monadnock.
</P>
<P>
   After searching for the perfect spot for five years, he bought
the land in 1951, then it took four years to dig the long driveway
up the hill by hand _ shovel load by shovel load. And another year
to build the house. He is most proud of a dumbwaiter he built to
bring firewood up from the basement. He used an old coal stoker as
the carrier.
</P>
<P>
   During his years working for contractors, he built homes and
office buildings as well as dams, bridges, and roads. And he laid a
lot of driveways. ``I could build anything anyone asked for,'' says
Proulx, whose formal education ended with high school. ``One of my
favorite jobs was dismantling an old house, moving it to Keene, and
then putting it back together again. I also got 27 barns built in
27 days at the race track in Hinsdale. Each of those barns had 20
stalls and five tack rooms. We put up a barn a day. I was directing
50 carpenters for that job.''
</P>
<P>
   Proulx emphasizes that he always did things the least expensive
way, but that he never scrimped on quality. He practices good
old-fashioned frugality in his home life but makes exceptions when
it comes to cars and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, he took a job at Yankee maintaining buildings. Since he
helped build most of the company's structures in Dublin, he was
well suited for the job. When the magazine was looking for a
columnist, an employee suggested Proulx: He was always answering
everyone's questions about old tools and helping with home building
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked me if I wanted to write a column and I said, `Sure,
for the heck of it, I'll try,''' says Proulx. ``So I made up some
questions and answered them. Then they sent it to be edited by some
guy, and he changed everything. I told them I couldn't put my name
on the changed column. I said I was writing for the ordinary guy
and I wanted it to be my wording. So they said they'd run the
column any way I wanted it. And they have.''
</P>
<P>
   He has written three books, all of which provide valuable tips
on everything from cleaning methods to bee stings, odor removal to
roof repair, crab grass control to car maintenance. His most recent
book is ``Yankee Magazine's Practical Problem Solver, 1,001
Ingenious Solutions to Everyday Dilemmas.'' There are suggestions
on how to cut your washing in half, make jewelry sparkle, and keep
pigeons away from the eaves of your house. Before that there was
``Yankee Magazine's Make It Last, Over 1,000 Ingenious Ways to
Extend the Life of Everything You Own'' and ``Earl Proulx's Yankee
Home Hints, From Stains on the Rug to Squirrels in the Attic, Over
1,500 Ingenious Solutions to Everyday Household Problems,'' with
over 500,000 copies in print.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, Proulx might write another book. For now the man Yankee
calls ``America's favorite handyman'' is content signing copies of
his latest tome at nearby bookstores and continuing to disseminate
advice in plain-talk style.

IN THE END, IT WILL BE PLAIN OLD TELEPHONE SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Too much time on the Internet can warp your judgment. Your ideas
about the world come to you in jagged little bits instead of
flowing human voices, and that can mislead you.
</P>
<P>
   I found myself falling into the trap Wednesday, as I thought
about AT&AMP;T Corp.'s acquisition of the cable TV company
Tele-Communications Inc. My first reaction was a surge of what can
only be called bandwidth lust. All I could see at first was AT&AMP;T
using all that coaxial cable to deliver high-speed Internet service
to 33 million homes. Broadband data services, a reality at last.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe one of these days. But the track record of our local
cable company MediaOne brought me back to earth. A couple of years
after rolling out ambitious broadband plans, MediaOne is still
basically a cable company. In the same way, AT&AMP;T will come out of
the TCI deal as much a telephone company as ever.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it'll be a couple of years before the company
will serve up a full spectrum of broadband offerings to all its
customers. I can sympathize. MediaOne has so far managed to install
its hot new system almost everywhere except my neighborhood in
Quincy. We're supposed to get lucky sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps MediaOne is in cahoots with my boss to make me spend
more time at the office. Here at the Globe, my computer is
connected to our corporate network, which links to the Internet at
1.5 million bits per second, far faster than my telephone modem at
home.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is immense. Not just because our Internet service
is fast, but because it's always on. Suddenly, the Web is the most
convenient source for information. I never use a Yellow Pages at
work; it's faster to look up phone numbers on the Web. When I want
corporate financial data, I download it directly from the
Securities and Exchange Commission. When I must question an
industry executive, I send an e-mail. It's often faster _ no
mucking around with voice mail _ and there's a written record of
our discussion.
</P>
<P>
   There's no need to dial a phone number and wait to log on. I'm
always on. Suddenly, the Internet isn't ``out there'' any more. It
works like a very large hard drive inside the computer. This is why
I've defended Microsoft Corp.'s plan to build Web browsing into its
operating systems. It's precisely the best place for a browser.
Many more people will realize this as high-speed Internet access
spreads across the land.
</P>
<P>
   But that could take forever, and not because of technology.
Here's the dirty little secret of home broadband services: &UR;  &LR; most
people don't seem to want them.
</P>
<P>
   MediaOne is one of the leaders in deploying advanced cable
technology. Almost half of the company's 5.1 million customers are
capable of using cable modems. Yet only 40,000 of them have signed
up. That's a lousy 2 percent subscription rate. MediaOne spokesman
Rick Jenkinson won't say whether MediaOne can make money at that
level of market penetration, but it's not hard to guess.
</P>
<P>
   Still, MediaOne is &UR;  &LR;  not counting on Internet service alone to
pay the freight, any more than AT&AMP;T is. The real money is likely to
come from the sale of boring old telephone service. ``Customers
spend a lot more on telephone than they do on cable or Internet at
this time,'' said Jenkinson.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts alone, Bell Atlantic serves up 4.5 million
phone lines, many to businesses and individuals that lease them by
the handful. These lines bring in revenues of $1.75 billion.
MediaOne wants a piece. Its &UR;  &LR;  upgraded cable systems will be able
to handle voice traffic, and the company plans to start peddling
the service this fall. If MediaOne can get just a slice of Bell
Atlantic's business, that'll justify the expense of converting
its &UR;  &LR;  cable system to broadband.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T is thinking the same way. It's &UR;  &LR;  mainly interested in
selling telephone service to those 33 million TCI subscribers _ and
not having to pay local phone companies for handling the start and
finish of the long-distance calls made by those customers. Today,
AT&AMP;T is locked out of the residential market because it doesn't
have wires running directly into customers' homes. They soon will.
And while those lines will provide millions of bits per second to
avid gearheads, it'll be plain old telephone service that pays the
freight.

THERE'S THIS DOG, YOU SEE ... 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MIKE BARNICLE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Has this ever happened to you? You're leaving for work or
perhaps going out your driveway en route to a vacation with the
nagging thought that you've forgotten something.
</P>
<P>
   Like, maybe, your pants? Or the tickets? Or shutting the
windows? Or turning off the gas stove? Stuff like that. Well, the
other day, I forgot to do something before leaving: Kill my dog.
</P>
<P>
   My dog is a moron. And he is bigger than Macedonia, so plotting
his death required planning as well as thought: Run over him in the
driveway as the kids sleep? Drench him in charcoal lighter, and
flip a match out the window as I leave?
</P>
<P>
   No. Too cruel. Plus I didn't want my children scarred for life
from living with someone guilty of dogicide.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the reason I wanted him dead is simple as well as
understandable: He ate my golf clubs, including the only one I
consistently hit with any authority, the 7-iron.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this is not all he has eaten over the past year. His
appetite has included 612 pairs of sneakers, a dining room set, and
a Ford Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to train him and failed. I took him to doggie school.
His tuition _ room and board _ was the rough equivalent of two
years at Milton Academy.
</P>
<P>
   He enjoyed great success there. He loved it so much that I began
wondering what fool ever came up with the saying, ``Works like a
dog'' or ``Is treated like a dog.'
</P>
<P>
   I mean, dogs wake up, get both breakfast and supper delivered to
them, take a nap, take a walk, take a dump, take another nap. They
do nothing. They don't work. They don't have to report to any
office. They don't have to explain why they were out so late, who
they were with, or why they did what they did to the French poodle
across the road.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, he did anything and everything for the trainer: He read
``Ulysses,'' prepared his own meals, cleaned his room, and
generally behaved better than Julia Child.
</P>
<P>
   Then he graduates and does nothing for me other than stare at me
with the eyes of a complete dope, looking exactly the way Christie
Brinkley would look while listening to a discussion of why India
and Pakistan went nuclear.
</P>
<P>
   So, the trainer asked to see me. I went and paid attention to
the guy for about an hour. He explained how I had to be stern and
consistent and use no big words.
</P>
<P>
   I went home. I thought about what I'd learned, got up from my
chair and began drinking water out of a toilet bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Something was terribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the golf clubs. They are the athletic equivalent of dogs;
they represent an idea that sounds good in theory, but turn out to
be worse than water torture in reality.
</P>
<P>
   Golf, of course, is the '90's version of crack for middle-age
males. We will go out at any hour of day or night and humiliate
ourselves worse than a whore on a corner in our lust to acquire the
latest equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Graphite shafts. Heads larger than Ted Kennedy's. Gloves that
take seven strokes off your game. All of this while forgetting my
late, great Dad's official slogan: ``It's a poor workman who blames
his tools.''
</P>
<P>
   Think about how nutty this is: When men were boys and perhaps
played baseball, if anybody said there was a better bat on the
market or that a newer glove would make them superior performers
you would quickly figure the person to be fresh out of an asylum.
</P>
<P>
   A glove was a glove. A bat was a bat. You throw the ball, catch
the ball, and hit the ball. Simple enough, and if you couldn't do
it, you went home and became a genius.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, let one guy tell you that graphite shafts will improve your
golf game and you are in the car headed toward the store. Just
yesterday, right after I gave up the thought of killing the dog, I
am in the Wayland Golf Shop when one of the all-time great golfers,
Steve Israel, tells me to buy Callaway irons rather than the
Taylor-Made I held in my hand.
</P>
<P>
   At the time he told me this I had known Israel for all of four
minutes. Yet his advice had a huge impact on me because golf causes
such huge insecurity in people that the slightest suggestion from
anyone can cause your convictions to resemble Kleenex in a
hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   So today I have a new set of irons and the same old phobias
about this miserable little pill that sits on a tee or settles in
grass, does not move at all when you try to hit it, but torments
and terrorizes millions across the country. Maybe, instead of doing
the dog, I should think things over and simply burn my sticks.

BREWERS HOPE SPORE WILL TAKE A POWDER IN THE US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MAC DANIEL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DANVERS, Mass. _ If you attended the American Society of Brewing
Chemists conference here this week, you likely heard three words
that could make suds-soaked American lips tremble.
</P>
<P>
   Hops powdery mildew.
</P>
<P>
   Last September in Washington state, 1,500 acres of hops, a plant
that is the basic element in beer, had to be destroyed because of
this airborne spore. It was the first time that this lethal mildew
had been found in America.
</P>
<P>
   Europe has been dealing with the disease for more than 300
years. And one of the reasons that American hops have dominated the
market for so long is the domestic crops' resistance to disease.
After last fall, this is no longer the case.
</P>
<P>
   This year's hops growing season has also featured an outbreak of
mildew, maybe worse than last year, and the nation's brewing
scientists are quietly scared while trying to find ways to fight
this disease.
</P>
<P>
   Some people believe the diseased hops do not affect the flavor
of beer. Nonetheless, there is ample concern that the outbreak of
mildew could have a serious impact on the American hops industry,
the largest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were cautiously optimistic a few weeks ago, but now we
think we still could have a major problem,'' said David Hysert, a
vice president with John I. Haas Inc., the largest grower and
seller of hops in the world.
</P>
<P>
   As for beer drinking itself, there seems to be little worry.
</P>
<P>
   While some trial brews have produced a ``mushroom-like aroma,''
others have found no noticeable difference between beer brewed with
hops powdery mildew and beer brewed without.
</P>
<P>
   And with a glut of hops in the world market now, some are
quietly saying that the arrival of the mildew in America is more a
blessing for the industry than a curse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average beer drinker in America right now shouldn't really
be affected by hops powdery mildew,'' said Mike Dutelle, director
of sales and marketing for John I. Haas Inc., in North America.
``It really hasn't been that significant.''
</P>
<P>
   The four-day conference ended Wednesday with a gala dinner and
an informal taste testing, in which spiked samples of beer were
swooshed and sniffed for aromas and tastes ranging from medicinal
to road kill, the result of beer that has been hit by too much heat
and light.
</P>
<P>
   The conference dissected beer into it finest elements. There
were abstracts ranging from developing a technique to detect
heat-induced flavor damage in beer to the frozen stability of beer.
</P>
<P>
   There was also new research presented by Jan F. Stevens of
Oregon State University that demonstrated the potential of a
component of hops in fighting breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which doesn't mean that women should go out and start drinking
more beer,'' said one researcher. ``It's just another possible use
for hops.''

THE DIRECTOR WHO GOT GEORGE CLOONEY TO ACT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Director Steven Soderbergh shows up for his interview almost an
hour early, and without a retinue of publicists. He's alone, with
his shiny new Apple G3 laptop. He's also unguarded and easy to talk
to, surprising since his ``sex, lies, and videotape'' set the world
on its ear nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first indie film to win at the Cannes Film Festival
and to make an impact at the mainstream box office; it produced $25
million on a $1.5 million investment. Since 1989, Soderbergh has
directed a handful of films, including the smart and underrated
coming-of-age story ``King of the Hill'' (which has nothing to do
with the animated show of the same name), and the noirish ``The
Underneath.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I aimed low,'' he says of ``Underneath,'' ``and I missed.''
</P>
<P>
   His newest picture, the adaptation of Elmore Leonard's ``Out of
Sight,'' smacks the target dead center. The story revolves around
an escaped bank robber (George Clooney) and the federal marshal
(Jennifer Lopez) bent on recapturing him. It may not be the kind of
project _ big budget, with a major star _ you'd associate with
Soderbergh. ``In this case, I had to go get this job, and audition
for it,'' he confesses.
</P>
<P>
   How does a director audition for a job? ``It means going to meet
with the producers, and with Clooney, who was attached at the time.
And saying, `This is how I want to do it. If you don't want to do
it this way, then I'm the wrong guy.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I made reference to a lot of films from the early '70s, that
period we all liked. The two I mentioned most specifically were
`The French Connection' _ in terms of its ground-level style,
really unadorned, nothing fancy _ and `The Last Detail,' which I
thought had a great balance of humor and drama. I guess I mentioned
the right movies, or the right reasons, because the other people
they were talking to fell away.''
</P>
<P>
   He has also been credited with freeing Clooney from that tic of
his, where he holds his head down and peers up into the camera.
``People see this performance of (Clooney's) and say, `Gee, how did
you get him to stop doing that?' I really didn't. He came in
knowing what he had to do. I was very impressed by him. He's smart
about acting. Or rather, smart about his acting,'' Soderbergh says
with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt this role provided George with the opportunity to do
the things that he does very well, and he's not often asked to do,
or allowed to do, or given the time to do. There's a ``gravitas''
to George that he hasn't got to show very much, a resigned quality
to him that, in this film, I think is very compelling.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a formidable task, restructuring Leonard's fiction for the
screen, one resolved by Soderbergh and screenwriter Scott Frank.
The Detroit-based Leonard is beloved in the film business, but what
works in his novels doesn't exactly translate to the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, if you break his books down into the plot, into what
happens,'' Soderbergh muses, ``then you've eliminated the most
interesting part of the books, which is the characters. The
characters aren't self-reflective, which is what I like about them.
They make decisions entirely based on emotions, and not any sort of
real logic. And as soon as you try to impose some sort of external
logic on this material it sort of falls apart. Or becomes not very
interesting. I try to maintain a style and tone throughout the film
that's true to Leonard, and sets that up, so that the audience
still comes away satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an intriguing time for Soderbergh now, being the midst of
the media storm for ``Out of Sight.'' But such scrutiny is not new
for him. The character study ``sex, lies, and videotape'' _ a
combination of melodrama and romantic comedy _ propelled him into
the spotlight and brought a whole new interest to the independent
filmmaking world. ``The great thing about winning at Cannes, was
that it was a surprise. I didn't anticipate it or ask for it,'' he
says, smiling. ``I just showed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's great about it, is that it's impossible to predict.
Somewhere out there right now _ anywhere in the world _ someone is
writing, or editing, or directing a movie that we're not aware of.
And it's gonna turn the (film) industry on its ear, again, six
months or a year from now. Last year, on two ends of the spectrum,
it was ``Titanic'' and ``The Full Monty.'' That what's exciting
about movies, is that somewhere out there, there's another surprise
lurking. I love the unpredictability of it.''

LAWMAKERS WRESTLE WITH PROBLEM OF LOST TOBACCO BILL REVENUE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Amid the ashes of last week's Senate defeat of the
tobacco bill was a nearly unnoticed vote on child care. By a 2-to-1
ratio, conservatives and liberals agreed to expand
child-development initiatives by 25 percent, pumping an extra $7
billion into child-care and Head Start programs.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the massive tobacco bill is dead, along with its
$516 billion in potential revenues over 25 years, the enthusiasm
for spending so much money on children seems only a memory.
President Clinton, who proposed his own version of the child-care
initiative, is not pushing alternative funding. Congressional
support is in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two-thirds of the Senate agreed on child care,'' said Helen
Blank, director of child-care services at the Children's Defense
Fund. ``When Congress thinks something is important, it finds a way
to pay for it. They found billions for highways.''
</P>
<P>
   But money for an array of initiatives that Clinton wanted to pay
for with a cigarette tax increase is not available _ and the White
House so far has no plan B for funding. Earlier this year, Clinton
proposed spending money on everything from school construction to
hiring more teachers. Now the White House strategy is to try to
revive tobacco legislation partly by stressing that no money will
be available for these programs.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also had plans to spend the $516 billion in revenues
expected from the cigarette tax increase, most notably a proposal
to eliminate the ``marriage penalty'' that adversely affects many
couples who file taxes jointly.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the debate on the tobacco bill, senators lined up
with proposals about how to spend the money that would be
generated. Senator John F. Kerry cosponsored the measure that would
have provided $7 billion over five years for child-care and Head
Start programs. The Senate voted 66-33 against tabling the
proposal, which was approved by voice vote.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry said he will continue fighting for child-care money,
especially funds that would have gone to Head Start, a federal
program to help low-income preschool children. The Massachusetts
Democrat said the money is needed because only 30,000 out of 3
million 3-year-olds _ or 1 percent _ who are eligible for the Early
Head Start program now participate, and only half of the 1.6
million 4- and 5-year-olds eligible for Head Start are in the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Since the tobacco bill was killed last week in the Senate,
Clinton may be remaining silent about other funding purposefully in
order to put pressure on Republicans to agree to a modified tobacco
bill that includes child-care money.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the states to get that money for child care, they need to
press for the tobacco bill,'' said Bruce Reed, assistant to the
president for domestic policy. ``We are not giving up on the
tobacco bill and will keep pressing forward in any event.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry, who is considering a run for the presidency, said the
White House strategy may be unrealistic. ``I'm not sure that will
be the big pressure point'' to persuade senators to back tobacco
legislation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry is hardly alone in trying to revive social programs that
were debated as part of the tobacco bill. Senator Edward M. Kennedy
hoped the tobacco bill would provide $12 billion in extra funding
for the National Institutes of Health, $6.5 billion for school
construction, and enough money to hire 100,000 teachers. The money
for schools and teachers was not in the last version of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy vowed to continue to fight for the measures, but without
the leverage of a tobacco bill, it is unclear whether he can
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also had proposals for spending the billions of
dollars that would have been generated by the $1.10-per-pack tax
hike. The GOP, with some Democratic support, wanted to use part of
the tobacco revenues to offset the so-called marriage penalty in
the tax code.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty affects many couples in which spouses earn roughly
equivalent salaries. Such couples pay more taxes filing jointly
than they would as individuals. Under the GOP proposal added to the
bill, all couples earning less than $50,000 would have received a
tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, said the fight to
eliminate the marriage penalty will continue in the debate over the
budget. Gramm said support was so impressive during the tobacco
debate that he is calling for expanding the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm wants the marriage penalty to be eliminated for all
married couples, a far more expensive proposition than what was
contained in the tobacco bill. Instead of costing $46 billion over
10 years, Gramm's proposal would cost $101 billion, he said. He
estimated that an average family earning $40,000 would get a tax
cut of $1,400 under the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe all we did in the tobacco bill was prove this is
Congress's top priority,'' Gramm said about the marriage penalty.
``Even though the bill is dead, the principle lives on.''

DON'T REVARNISH THRESHOLD, STAIN IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. The varnish on my exterior oak threshold is wearing off. How
can I lighten the oak in order to revarnish it?
</P>
<P>
   JOHN SIEGMAN, Princeton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You can lighten the oak by sanding it to the bare wood, but I
would avoid varnishing it again; it will simply wear off and peel
sooner than you might hope. Varnish might be all right if the
threshold is completely protected from the weather, but if this is
not the case, I suggest staining the threshold with a
semitransparent stain. Only one coat is needed, and when it wears
in three to five years, you slap on another coat. And, no peeling.
Color choices range from dark brown and beige to light and dark
gray, with other earth colors inbetween.
</P>
<P>
   Semitransparent stain is made to cover shingles and clapboards,
but it will work equally well on horizontal surfaces such as
thresholds or decks.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's the best way to cut a hole for a sink in my laminated
plastic countertop? The plastic is already glued to the top.
</P>
<P>
   CLIFF BUCHANAN, Hanover, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Laminated plastic is normally cut with a plastic cutter, a
small, inexpensive tool with a hard scoring point that scores the
plastic enough so that it can be snapped, making a clean, straight
cut. You could try this on the plastic that is glued to the
counter, but it will be difficult and very tedious because you have
to score all the way through rather than snapping it. Before you
begin, make an outline of the opening on the plastic.
</P>
<P>
   The only other way that I know of is to use a hacksaw blade in a
saber saw. First, drill 3/8-inch holes with a power drill in each
corner of the outline so you can insert a saber-saw hacksaw blade.
The saber-saw hacksaw blade will keep chipping to a minimum, but be
sure to keep the saber-saw plate firmly and flat on the plastic, to
avoid lifting of the plastic. If the plastic lifts, it will chatter
with the movement of the blade, and you will get severe chipping.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I bought a nice antique bed with double-thick rails (about 1
1/2 inches) but to my surprise the box spring does not fit between
the rails. The box spring is as wide as the distance from one rail
to the other. What can I do? I can't put the box spring on top of
the rails; this would make the mattress way too high.
</P>
<P>
   M.J., from Massachusetts
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. For every 5,000 antique beds out there, there are 4,900
different sizes, it seems. You could have a box spring made to fit
but it would be expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a way to fix everything, and have the box spring left
over to put on another bed frame. Make your own box spring to fit,
except it is not a spring at all but a plywood frame.
</P>
<P>
   This frame can be an open box made of 3/4-inch pine boards with
a 1/2-inch plywood top. Put in crossbars for extra strength if the
bed frame is more than 40 inches wide. You want to make the frame
as thick as the depth of the rails, so that the top is flush with
the tops of the rails; that way the mattress will go on top of the
frame and come to the outer edges of the rails.
</P>
<P>
   Such an arrangement, with a quality mattress, sounds a little
firmer than you might like, but you may find it quite comfortable.
The handyman did just this on two beds, and its occupants have not
complained yet.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The only gutter I have on the house is at the rear. It is 15
feet long and has a downspout only at one end. Water tends to flow
toward the end with no downspout; but that end is open and it
becomes a waterfall. What's wrong and what can I do?
</P>
<P>
   A.C., from Massachusetts
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Two things are wrong: The gutter is sloping in the wrong
direction and there is no end block to prevent that waterfall. One
thing is right, though; one downspout is enough. Actually, the
informal rule on downspouts is that there should be one downspout
for each 30 feet of gutter.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, you can block that open end, and reslope the gutter so
that it slopes toward the downspout. Your gutter was either
installed wrong or became loose and drooped, sagged, or slanted the
wrong away. And while a level gutter will drain, a sagging one
(say, sagging in the middle) or one sloping in the wrong direction
obviously will not.
</P>
<P>

`LAND GIRLS' MIRED DOWN ON THE FARM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TODD CAMP 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Writer/director David Leland's new historical drama ``The Land
Girls'' is like a cryogenically preserved rose _ cold and
completely lifeless, yet still strangely beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   That is, of course, until you touch it and it crumbles into a
thousand pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why pretty settings and lush photography might be
appealing on the surface, but Leland's inability to create any kind
of involving story line or characters worth giving a flip for
disintegrates into an experience about as entertaining as an
outdoor insurance seminar in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   Set during World War II (and seeming to last longer than the
entire conflict), ``The Land Girls'' refers to the Women's Land
Army, an organization for war brides and able-bodied young women
who were dispatched across England to pick up the slack for
soldiers serving in the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to do their duty, three spirited lasses find
themselves teamed at a rural Dorset farm under the watchful eye of
a less-than-thrilled head of the household.
</P>
<P>
   Stella (Catherine McCormack) is the level-headed, moon-eyed
romantic, promised to a handsome naval officer. Ag (Rachel Weisz)
is the flaky but proper one of the bunch, and Prue (Anna Friel) is
the hellcat, a quick-witted hairdresser with an eye for the
farmer's son.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, everyone's got an eye for the farmer's son,
but poor Joe (Steven Mackintosh) is too clueless to notice. Not
that that stops the girls, of course. By the time poor Stella gets
around to falling for him, both of her buddies have already had a
go. She doesn't seem to mind, though. (Were all war-time romances
this shallow?)
</P>
<P>
   In between these developments, there are lots of sumptuous shots
of green meadows and forest lanes along with plenty of scenes of
the girls wallowing in mud and engaging in other filthy manual
labor (bet this was a fun shoot, huh?).
</P>
<P>
   But the only emotion ``Land Girls'' manages to muster is intense
indifference. Nobody ever ``does'' anything, and there are so many
shots of the gals engaging in menial farm chores, you leave the
picture feeling like you've done most of them yourself.
</P>
<P>
   The players are good, McCormack especially, but without any
dramatic impact to play with, their efforts are wasted and the
point of this whole tedious exercise escapes even the most
attentive audience member. When a damaged German fighter plane
crashes onto one of the meadows, you find yourself regretting the
doomed chap didn't take out the whole lot with him.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK &UR;  &LR; _ &UR;  &LR; Steven Brill is moving around his modest Fifth
Avenue office mentally replaying Sunday's ``Thrilla in Washington''
battle with Tim Russert. The editor and publisher of the new
Brill's Content magazine went on Russert's ``Meet the Press'' to
discuss his explosive story charging independent counsel Kenneth
Starr and the press corps with grievous misdeeds in the handling of
the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   When the cameras rolled, host Russert quickly pounced, summing
up the complaints of angry journalists who accused Brill of shoddy
work in his article headlined ``Pressgate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather a dubious debut for a so-called media watchdog,
wouldn't you say?'' Russert asked Brill.
</P>
<P>
   Brill quickly counterattacked, accusing Russert of erroneous
punditry that he hadn't admitted to. And he suggested to another
guest, Weekly Standard executive editor Fred Barnes, that his
magazine had attacked Brill because Content is working on a story
revealing the fat sums that people like Barnes pull down on the
speaking circuit. All in all, pretty sweaty stuff for a Sunday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Now, two days after the ``Meet the Press'' dust-up, Brill is in
his office working on a sharper response to the Russerts of the
world. In starting a magazine of media criticism, Brill obviously
wanted to watch the watchers. The grand irony is that he is now the
most scrutinized man on the media radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly toying with his famous unlit cigar _ before stowing it
when the photographer starts clicking _ he suddenly seems to find a
strategy for dealing with all this.
</P>
<P>
   ``No more Mr. Nice Guy,'' he says with a sly smile.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Nice Guy is not something that the 47-year-old Queens native
(and Deerfield Academy, Yale, and Yale Law grad) gets called very
often. Throughout his rather amazing career _ from freelance writer
to youthful founder of The American Lawyer and Court TV to the man
behind the magazine that has the media all atwitter _ Brill has
been known primarily for two things. He is a demanding boss who
doesn't suffer fools: In a 1986 Wall Street Journal profile, his
sister said, ``He can be a real SOB.'' And he is a driven and
highly intelligent journalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a very courageous guy,'' says Tom Rosenstiel, vice
chairman of the Committee of Concerned Journalists. ``Very smart
and full of the kind of hubris that is necessary for a journalist
who takes on his own craft. ... The guy is a monumental figure in
his business.''
</P>
<P>
   Brill rolls his eyes when you bring up the old war stories _ how
he made underlings cry with his cutting assessments of their work
or how, years ago, he supposedly bit someone during a water polo
match. For the record, Brill denies the chomp occurred, saying the
alleged victim _ financial writer James Cramer, who contributed to
the first issue of Content _ ``swears I did.'' But, jokes Brill,
``he had to be on drugs at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' says Brill, ``I am tough about ...'' and then to
illustrate what he is tough about, he grabs a story manuscript. In
the margin is scribbled the word ``sidebar,'' meaning Brill is
going to ask the writer to go back and do more reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Says Boston Globe staffer Gregg Krupa, who worked at Brill's
Manhattan Lawyer for several years: ``If you could put up with the
occasional vituperative comment, there was the reward of this
feeling that we were really doing cool stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   If he doesn't relish the resurfacing of the big-bad-Brill
stories, the Content boss had better get used to the attention.
He's got a reporter in his office, The Washington Post is
supposedly working on a big story about him, and the Los Angeles
Press Club is on the line, asking him to speak. Now Brill is the
guy under the microscope.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Genesis in Time trial
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The idea of creating a magazine of media scrutiny began
percolating in Brill's head when he wrote a 1985 American Lawyer
piece attacking Time magazine for its story on former Israeli
defense minister's Ariel Sharon's role in the 1982 Palestinian
massacres, coverage that made Time the defendant in a libel trial.
Several years back, when he was partnered with Time-Warner, Brill
broached the idea of buying the Columbia Journalism Review to
Time-Warner boss Gerald Levin.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the publication of the first issue of Content,
Brill's every move has been dissected. An ill-conceived plan to
link his magazine with NBC's ``Dateline'' program quickly surfaced
in the media and had to be scrapped. Stories have already
questioned whether his partnership with Content investor and cable
executive Barry Diller will deter him from examining Diller's
friends. And when Brill delivered a speech to students at a tony
New York private school urging them to toughen up the school paper,
he earned a skewering from New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd,
who called him the media's ``very own Godzilla.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was nothing compared with the response generated by the
``Pressgate'' story that Brill released June 13. Its provocative
thesis _ that Starr improperly leaked the ``most damaging details''
of his investigation to a scandal-starved press corps that became
``an enabler of Starr's abuse of power'' _ created a furious
backlash. Starr responded with a 19-page letter accusing Brill of a
``reckless and irresponsible attack'' bordering on libel. ABC News
president David Westin wrote a little letter to Brill noting that
``it is tempting to point out the various inaccuracies in your
reporting.'' One Brill target in ``Pressgate,'' NBC reporter David
Bloom, retorted, ``Just a willingness to hurl insults shouldn't be
mistaken for sound journalism.'' Another, The Washington Post's
Susan Schmidt, wrote an angry letter to Brill.

   And then there was the revelation that Brill hadn't disclosed
contributions he and his wife made to the Clinton-Gore campaign and
Democratic congressional candidates. That was something Russert
grilled Brill about on Sunday, pointedly noting that ``there is a
lot of concern that perhaps you did have a political agenda in
writing this article.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if had anticipated all this attention, Brill says
that on an intellectual level he was prepared. As he began
disseminating copies of ``Pressgate,'' he recalls saying that ``I
feel like I'm about to go over Niagara Falls in a barrel.''
</P>
<P>
   But the intensity of the reaction, he admits, ``surprises you at

   When Steven Brill was a boy, he organized a neighborhood
snow-shoveling operation by collecting an up-front fee of $25
apiece from a group of homeowners and subcontracting the work to
chums. When an unusually mild winter delivered only one or two
snowfalls, Brill had a tidy little profit. But he never returned to
the enterprise, figuring ``you can't get lucky two years in a
row.''
</P>
<P>
   From that point on, no one should have doubted his
entrepreneurial bent. He was in his 20s when he founded The
American Lawyer and barely in his 40s when Court TV debuted in
1991. Brill will not say how much he banked when Time-Warner bought
out his American Lawyer Media last year, other than to say that the
$30 million figure most frequently bandied about is ``not right.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Brill, he and his three minority partners invested
a total of $25 million in Content, which has an annual budget of
around $13 million. The magic number he is aiming for five years
down the line is a circulation of 500,000. Content starts making
money, he says, at about 400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers are skeptical that a magazine that examines the
media can put up those kinds of numbers. In a recent New York
magazine article, one analyst compared Content with the movie
``Primary Colors,'' warning that ``in media centers, that film did
very well. In the hinterlands, nobody gave a damn.''
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to Brill's crafty Saturday release of ``Pressgate,''
_ timed perfectly to make him the talk of the next day's Washington
TV panel show circuit _ Content is out of the gate at a full
gallop. The magazine has already announced that because of
``unexpected demand,'' it is going back for a second printing of
the first issue. And Brill calculates that he will sell well over
300,000 copies of that edition.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia government professor,
calls Brill's promotion of the debut issue ``a master stroke. It
was about salesmanship and it succeeded. ... He managed to play the
media like a fiddle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve has certainly achieved a huge buildup,'' notes Columbia
Journalism Review editor Marshall Loeb.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be wrong to accuse Content, or Brill, of being more
sizzle than steak. Regardless of one's opinion of ``Pressgate,''
the rest of the magazine features an intelligent, eclectic, and
eminently readable lineup of stories that cover everything from the
lives of those who book guests on TV news shows to the Barnes &AMP;
Noble executive who decides which books go on the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   The American Lawyer reflected Brill's ability to broaden the
appeal of narrow subject matter. The legal profession wasn't used
to being seriously covered when Brill started the publication and
``was absolutely freaked out,'' says Krupa. American Lawyer stories
_ ranging from a look at Hillary Rodham Clinton's duties at the
Rose law firm to Brill's listing of the ``Am Law 100'' top-grossing
law firms _ expanded a trade publication into something both
accessible and interesting to a wider audience.
</P>
<P>
   Brill says the idea behind Content is to ``make it much broader
than a journalism review. ... We've been very careful to make the
magazine's voice such that it is for people outside the industry.''
And despite long odds, some are betting that if anyone can sell
media criticism to the masses, it is Brill.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done something very few people thought he could do,
potentially ... secure a larger subscriber base than anyone thought
possible,'' says Sabato.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Course corrections
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Steven Brill prides himself on being a guy who can say he's
sorry. He has admitted he was ``dumb'' on the ``Dateline''
collaboration and wrong for not disclosing his political
contributions. In the next issue, he will apologize for making an
error about The Wall Street Journal's handling of the Lewinsky
scandal. And he is going to run all of Starr's 19-page letter in
Content.
</P>
<P>
   But the battling Brill quickly emerges when he is asked for a
response to the independent counsel's critique of ``Pressgate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to slough it off; it did take someone a long time
to type it,'' he says, doing a poor job of concealing the sarcasm.
``But there's not a lot to respond to.''
</P>
<P>
   This is man who clearly relishes the contest, whether it be on
the baseball field _ he has built a diamond at his home and is
famous for his competitive approach to the game _ or in the world
of journalism.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why he chose the role of media policeman rather than,
say, editor of a major newspaper, Brill says simply: ``In some
ways, I think I can have much more impact.'' And the negative
reaction to the magazine from what Brill calls the ``dark ...
underbelly of journalism'' is ``the single best argument'' for
publishing it, he says.
</P>
<P>
   He concedes that Content could sow the seeds of its own demise
if it succeeds in getting the media to police themselves. ``That's
the weak link in my business plan, that I exist (because of) their
arrogance.'' Then he tacks on three words that will disabuse anyone
of the Mr. Nice Guy notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I'm safe.''

WALLACE GETS RUSTY AS WINNING NASCAR STAR HAS RUN OF BAD LUCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SONOMA, Calif. _ NASCAR veteran Rusty Wallace can tell you, race
by race, why he hasn't won in Winston Cup competition this season.
He's smiling while he talks, but he's not happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dover, Delaware,'' he said. ``As soon as I hit the pit road
the caution flag comes out. That put me down two laps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bristol, Tennessee. I was on the pole, big, big lead, and the
motor blows.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the California 500 I was running second with eight laps to
go. Blown motor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week the car was just flying. Thirteen laps into the
race, blown engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the one that really hurt _ the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte.
I'm running really good at the end, the caution flag comes out and
we all pull into the pits ... put on two new tires. (Jeff) Gordon's
running seventh, his crew chief says, `What've we got to lose?
Let's put on four tires,' and he just flies out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, who finished second behind Gordon at Charlotte, said,
``That one cost me a million, 200,000 dollars ... But my life's
been that way _ either hero or hobo.''
</P>
<P>
   The end result of Wallace's troubles is a drop to sixth place in
the points standings as Winston Cup racers head into this weekend's
Save Mart/Kragen 350 at Sears Point Raceway near Sonoma.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, with 1,992 points, trails Jeremy Mayfield (2,208
points), Gordon (2,172), Dale Jarrett (2,160), Mark Martin (2,155)
and Terry Labonte (2,008) as the Winston Cup field heads into
Friday's qualifying runs.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, whose Miller Lite Ford runs on the same Penske team as
Mayfield's Mobil 1 Ford, said ``it's just luck'' that his cars have
had three blown engines while Mayfield's have cruised to the points
lead. Last week, for instance, the crankshaft on Wallace's Ford
broke in two, smashing his engine to pieces. ``It was a brand-new
engine, and the crankshaft only had a thousand miles on it, which
isn't much. But the way it broke ... it was like having an atom
bomb under the hood.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't have those blown engines, I'd probably be a leader
in the standings,'' said Wallace, who has twice won the pole
position and finished second four times. ``But at 220-something
points behind, it's going to take some kind of heroic move by my
team to get back out in front.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's purse is set at $2.016 million, and in order to take
the $90,025 first-place money, Wallace will have to run full-out.
Having a faster Sears Point track, with a new straightaway at the
top of the course, should help.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, who tested the track for the first time Wednesday, said
eliminating two curves to create ``The Chute'' will make the race
``real, real fast. I don't think you're going to want to go
side-by-side through there, hitting 150 miles an hour, the wall 4
feet off to your left.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are drawbacks to wiping out two curves, Wallace added
_ ``Exiting that carousel before, that was a real good spot for me
to set up a pass. Now that's gone. I'm going to have to find
another spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Things are also complicated by new NASCAR rules, including
downsized rear spoilers, that have led to floating crashes. Wallace
said Dale Earnhardt wasn't too happy when, two weeks ago at
Michigan, the Miller Lite Ford ``got loose and got up into him.''

LAWMAKERS WRESTLE WITH PROBLEM OF LOST TOBACCO BILL REVENUE

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Amid the ashes of last week's Senate defeat of the
tobacco bill was a nearly unnoticed vote on child care. By a 2-to-1
ratio, conservatives and liberals agreed to expand
child-development initiatives by 25 percent, pumping an extra $7
billion into child-care and Head Start programs.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the massive tobacco bill is dead, along with its
$516 billion in potential revenues over 25 years, the enthusiasm
for spending so much money on children seems only a memory.
President Clinton, who proposed his own version of the child-care
initiative, is not pushing alternative funding. Congressional
support is in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two-thirds of the Senate agreed on child care,'' said Helen
Blank, director of child-care services at the Children's Defense
Fund. ``When Congress thinks something is important, it finds a way
to pay for it. They found billions for highways.''
</P>
<P>
   But money for an array of initiatives that Clinton wanted to pay
for with a cigarette tax increase is not available _ and the White
House so far has no plan B for funding. Earlier this year, Clinton
proposed spending money on everything from school construction to
hiring more teachers. Now the White House strategy is to try to
revive tobacco legislation partly by stressing that no money will
be available for these programs.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also had plans to spend the $516 billion in revenues
expected from the cigarette tax increase, most notably a proposal
to eliminate the ``marriage penalty'' that adversely affects many
couples who file taxes jointly.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the debate on the tobacco bill, senators lined up
with proposals about how to spend the money that would be
generated. Senator John F. Kerry cosponsored the measure that would
have provided $7 billion over five years for child-care and Head
Start programs. The Senate voted 66-33 against tabling the
proposal, which was approved by voice vote.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry said he will continue fighting for child-care money,
especially funds that would have gone to Head Start, a federal
program to help low-income preschool children. The Massachusetts
Democrat said the money is needed because only 30,000 out of 3
million 3-year-olds _ or 1 percent _ who are eligible for the Early
Head Start program now participate, and only half of the 1.6
million 4- and 5-year-olds eligible for Head Start are in the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Since the tobacco bill was killed last week in the Senate,
Clinton may be remaining silent about other funding purposefully in
order to put pressure on Republicans to agree to a modified tobacco
bill that includes child-care money.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the states to get that money for child care, they need to
press for the tobacco bill,'' said Bruce Reed, assistant to the
president for domestic policy. ``We are not giving up on the
tobacco bill and will keep pressing forward in any event.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry, who is considering a run for the presidency, said the
White House strategy may be unrealistic. ``I'm not sure that will
be the big pressure point'' to persuade senators to back tobacco
legislation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry is hardly alone in trying to revive social programs that
were debated as part of the tobacco bill. Senator Edward M. Kennedy
hoped the tobacco bill would provide $12 billion in extra funding
for the National Institutes of Health, $6.5 billion for school
construction, and enough money to hire 100,000 teachers. The money
for schools and teachers was not in the last version of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy vowed to continue to fight for the measures, but without
the leverage of a tobacco bill, it is unclear whether he can
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also had proposals for spending the billions of
dollars that would have been generated by the $1.10-per-pack tax
hike. The GOP, with some Democratic support, wanted to use part of
the tobacco revenues to offset the so-called marriage penalty in
the tax code.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty affects many couples in which spouses earn roughly
equivalent salaries. Such couples pay more taxes filing jointly
than they would as individuals. Under the GOP proposal added to the
bill, all couples earning less than $50,000 would have received a
tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, said the fight to
eliminate the marriage penalty will continue in the debate over the
budget. Gramm said support was so impressive during the tobacco
debate that he is calling for expanding the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm wants the marriage penalty to be eliminated for all
married couples, a far more expensive proposition than what was
contained in the tobacco bill. Instead of costing $46 billion over
10 years, Gramm's proposal would cost $101 billion, he said. He
estimated that an average family earning $40,000 would get a tax
cut of $1,400 under the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe all we did in the tobacco bill was prove this is
Congress's top priority,'' Gramm said about the marriage penalty.
``Even though the bill is dead, the principle lives on.''

MAKE MY VOTE CREAM FILLED

   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Soon Massachusetts may have a state polka, but will it ever have
a state doughnut?
</P>
<P>
   According to a story in Tuesday's Globe, we already have a state
bean (navy), a state insect (lady bug), a state cookie (chocolate
chip, or, strictly speaking, Toll House). We even have a state cat
(tabby), which came as a surprise to me, and perhaps to the yellow
tabby chosen to illustrate the story, who stares into the camera
with an expression that seems to say, ``Who me? State cat?''
</P>
<P>
   However a campaign initiated by Emma Krane, 8, and backed by her
classmates in Mary McDermott's third grade class at the Brown
School in Somerville to have the Boston cream doughnut named the
state's official doughnut was rejected by the State Administration
Committee. In the same session the committee recommended a song
with the catchy title ``Say Hello to Someone in Massachusetts'' be
named the state's official polka.
</P>
<P>
   Putting a state polka ahead of a state doughnut strikes me as
unfair and shortsighted in light of the important role doughnuts
play in the life of our Commonwealth. At any given moment, there
are more people in Massachusetts eating doughnuts than doing the
polka. True, they may not all be eating Boston cream (or creme or
kreme, depending on where you buy them) doughnuts, but according to
Dunkin Donuts, their stores alone sell 14 million Boston Kreme
Donuts annually in this state. That's an awful lot of doughnuts.
</P>
<P>
   The legislative committee rejected the Somerville third-graders'
petition on the grounds that the Boston cream doughnut ``lacks
historical significance.''
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the Boston cream doughnut may not figure as
prominently in the history of the Commonwealth as the cod, which
fueled our economy for centuries until it was fished to the brink
of extinction. (That's one thing you can be sure of with any kind
of doughnuts, they'll never be a threatened species.) And it may be
true that the Boston cream doughnut isn't as firmly connected in
the public mind with our state capital as the Boston baked bean.
</P>
<P>
   But how many beaneries do you see hereabouts? How many
codderies? And yet, seemingly on every other streetcorner, there's
a doughnutery, which is what doughnut shops were once called,
according to H.L. Mencken's ``The American Language.'' Now they are
all called Dunkin' Donuts, a company that was founded in Quincy and
has its international corporate headquarters in Randolph, where it
lays plans to deluge the world with doughnuts.
</P>
<P>
   The Somerville third graders' Boston cream doughnut proposal may
have been done in by political regionalism, ever the bane of
progress in our Commonwealth. Leading the fight against it was Rep.
Cele Hahn (R-Westfield) who took time from her busy schedule to
post what I can only describe as an anti-doughnut diatribe on her
web page. ``I ask you, do we need an official donut?'' Hahn writes.
</P>
<P>
   And if we do, she writes, why should it be the Boston cream?
``Isn't that just a little too eastern?'' she asks.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe she'd get behind a Westfield cream doughnut.
</P>
<P>
   Hahn notes that in some places in her constituency the Boston
cream doughnut is known as the Bavarian cream doughnut. She
speculates that if it were named official state doughnut it might
lead to ethnic strife. ``Would, say, the Norwegians demand another
type of donut?'' she asks. ``How about the Czechs? The Irish?''
</P>
<P>
   She may be onto something with that Irish cream doughnut idea.
Sounds tasty. Meanwhile, Emma Kane, reached yesterday on her last
day of school, said she and her classmates haven't given up.
They've written a letter to the governor. The're planning another
campaign. The doughnut issue isn't dead yet.

   I was sitting in an elementary school gymnasium, watching first
and second graders perform in an end-of-the-school-year play. The
set, made out of refrigerator cartons by my daughter Laura and her
friends, showed the sides of a sailing ship, complete with rigging,
cannons, and pilings while the youngsters on stage pretended to be
powder monkeys on  &UR; board the USS Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The kids were singing their hearts out. Each parent and
grandparent, I'm sure, had eyes for no one but their own incredibly
talented little monkey. I was having trouble watching my
granddaughter, however, because of the tears running down my
cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom, this is a happy occasion.'' My daughter Julie was staring
at me, astonished. ``Why are you crying?''

   You had to be there. It wasn't only the words:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I have often dreamed of a far off place
</P>
<P>
   Where a hero's welcome would be waiting for me,
</P>
<P>
   Where the crowds will cheer when they see my face
</P>
<P>
   And a voice keeps saying this is where I'm meant to be.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You had to see the children's shining eyes and radiant faces.
You had to experience how deeply those words resonated within them.
They weren't acting. They want to be heroes when they grow up _
brave, virtuous, and idealistic _ and be recognized for eir
courage. I know because I remember how I felt when I was their age.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'll be there someday.
</P>
<P>
   I can go the distance.
</P>
<P>
   I will find my way if I can be strong
</P>
<P>
   I know every mile will be worth my while
</P>
<P>
   When I go the distance,
</P>
<P>
   I'll be right where I belong.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These children still believe the future holds a challenge large
enough for their abilities and an occupation meaningful enough to
become their life's work. To a child, they are planning on making
the world a better place. We haven't yet shrunk them small enough
to fit within the narrow confines of our consumer culture.
</P>
<P>
   Not that we haven't started. After all, we enrolled them in
Consumer U. the day we sat them down in front of the TV. They've
already mastered some of the vocabulary they'll need if they're
going to pass the SAT (Self-indulgent Acquisition Test) we use for
admission to the world we're offering them: Beanie Babies, Nike
sneakers, Barbie dolls, Big Macs, L.L. Bean backpacks, Froot Loops
...
</P>
<P>
   But they haven't gotten the following mathematical formula down
pat yet: Getting good grades (EQ) getting into a good college (EQ)
getting a good job (EQ) making a lot of money (EQ) buying
everything you want (EQ) fulfilling the American Dream. Or taken
the class called ``Living Beyond Your Means: Magic Tricks You Can
Do With a Credit Card.''
</P>
<P>
   They still need to develop keener observational skills, such as
how to judge their friends by what they own, how to find out what
products are ``in'' or ``out'' at any given moment, that pretty and
thin is never pretty and thin enough. Then there's social studies.
They're just learning that looking out for No.1 is the key to
success, that they should feel contempt for those uglier, fatter,
poorer, or stupider than they are, that salary is the only measure
by which jobs are worth pursuing, and that those who wish to win
must be willing to sacrifice everything and everyone else to their
ambition.
</P>
<P>
   Soon we'll teach them how much more profitable it is to be a
celebrity than a hero. (Goodbye, shining eyes.) We'll inform them
that all our leaders are self-serving charlatans. (So long, radiant
faces.) We'll convince them that everyone lies. (Farewell, trust.)
We'll numb their sensitivity with 10,000 televised murders. (Who
needs compassion?) We'll demonstrate that making money always takes
precedence over protecting the environment. (Of what use is hope?)
By the time they're teens, they'll know the only power worth
exercising is buying power.
</P>
<P>
   Then the girls can concentrate on weighing themselves while the
boys breathlessly follow their favorite teams. Unless we commit
ourselves to keeping this from happening, by the time they go the
distance, they'll be just where they belong _ where the only mile
that is worth their while leads to a shopping mall.

<P>
   A portal, according to the dictionary, is a grand and impressive
doorway. It's the sort of entrance you would find on a Gothic
cathedral or the US Capitol _ and now, the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Companies ranging from Internet specialist Yahoo Inc. to media
giant Walt Disney Co. are building ``portal sites'' on the World
Wide Web _ attractive, easy-opening front doors to the vast
information storehouse of cyberspace. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It makes for the hottest trend on the &UR;  &LR; hot and ever trendy
'Net. &UR;  &LR; The rush to develop or acquire such digital gateways has
sparked a flurry of corporate dealmaking, prompted efforts to
develop portal brand names, opened up huge new potential for
advertisers, and boosted the market value of leading Internet
companies. Indeed, so many players are piling into the portal
market that some predict a shakeout before long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt the most contagious disease running amok among
Web marketers is portal-itis,'' jokes Gregory Wester, research
director for the Yankee Group in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the portals started as Internet ``search
engines,'' &UR;  &LR; where Web surfers go to track down information by
keying in terms _ for example, ``World Cup soccer'' _ and then
clicking on the sites found by the service. They are now expanding
themselves into gateways to dozens of on-line resources: news
headlines, weather reports, electronic mail, classified
advertising, shopping, even advice for small-business owners.
</P>
<P>
   Already, portals like Yahoo, Lycos, and Excite are among the
most popular sites on the World Wide Web, attracting millions of
visitors every month. But these firms face competition from some of
America's biggest media companies, which are eager to gain wider
audiences for their programming and other content.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two weeks ago, the NBC broadcasting unit of General
Electric Co. invested $165 million in Snap, a relatively new and
little-visited portal operated by the popular Internet news service
CNet Inc. Then last Thursday, Disney, which owns the ABC television
network, acquired a 43 percent stake in Infoseek Corp. in a complex
deal worth about $900 million. Infoseek is an Internet search
service that's among the 10 most popular sites on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the browser war between software companies Microsoft
Corp. and Netscape Communications Corp. is turning into a portal
war. Both firms make Internet software that &UR;  &LR; automatically directs
millions of users to their corporate Web sites. Microsoft and
Netscape are beefing up these sites, turning them into full-service
portals that will be the first Web sites many people see when they
dial into the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The portal services &UR;  &LR; should sound familiar to users of such
traditional on-line computer networks as America Online or
CompuServe. These companies provided the same kind of service to
millions of customers over private computer networks long before
the Internet became popular. Indeed, many portal executives admit
that they want to duplicate the formula that has made AOL, with 12
million subscribers, far and away the world's most successful
consumer on-line business. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``We've become like a free version of America Online,'' says Bob
Davis, chief executive of Lycos Inc. Started as a site for looking
up other Internet sites, the Waltham, Mass. company now offers
about 200 services ranging from free e-mail to on-line parlor games
like chess and backgammon.
</P>
<P>
   The comparison amuses Barry Schuler, president of AOL's
interactive services unit. Not only does his company dominate the
commercial on-line service business, its Internet Web site,
aol.com, is the Web's second-most-popular location, with 22.8
million visitors in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers buy brands. That's an absolute,'' Schuler says.
``America Online is the only true national brand in the Internet
on-line world.''
</P>
<P>
   There are problems with AOL as a role model for portals. More
than 80 percent of AOL's revenue comes &UR;  &LR; from subscriber fees. By
contrast, portals don't charge customers a dime. Anyone with
Internet access is welcome.
</P>
<P>
   The portal players think the Internet can be made to pay just as
television has: by rounding up viewers and bombarding them with
advertising. The profits come from corporations ready to pay
millions for a chance to hawk their wares to an audience of
millions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, portals cut distribution deals with major Internet
retailers. For example, the on-line bookstore Barnes&AMP;Noble.com pays
a premium to the Lycos portal. In exchange, Barnes &AMP; Noble gets
listed on the Lycos home page as the site's preferred source for
books.
</P>
<P>
   But comparing portals to TV channels suggests that a shakeout is
inevitable. After all, the bulk of TV ad revenues are earned by the
four major broadcast networks, with dozens of cable companies
fighting for the leftovers. Portal competitors think the same thing
will happen on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The frenzied battle for the top slots among portal sites has
begun.
</P>
<P>
   As with television, the key is ratings. The winners will be
portals that can attract tens of millions of regular visitors.

Clinton during his 21-gun greeting at Tiananmen Square and the

scaled down anti-teen smoking bill. Sources say there will be
provisions to allow FDA regulation of tobacco, but it will be a

it is not expected to call for a price increase to pay for the wide

 UNDATED: ... regular visitors.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``A portal is a site that can successfully broker a significant
share of consumers' information, communication, and commerce
needs,'' says the Yankee Group's Wester. ``Anyone who doesn't have
significant share is just a damn Web site.''
</P>
<P>
   The closest to a sure thing in the portal sweepstakes is Yahoo,
which practically invented the concept. Yahoo was created as an
Internet directory by two Stanford University graduate students.
But it quickly evolved into a one-stop center for many on-line
services. Today, Yahoo is not only the most popular site on the
Internet, with more than 30 million visitors a month. It's also one
of those rare Internet businesses that actually turns a profit _
$2.2 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo and the other search services have a major advantage in
the portal sweepstakes. They are perhaps the only Internet sites
that virtually everyone has to visit sooner or later. The Web is
now so big _ more than 320 million pages according to one recent
estimate in the journal Science _ that a search service is the only
way anybody can hope to find information.
</P>
<P>
   Other search services are moving quickly to take advantage of
their high traffic rates. In the past year, Lycos has added free
e-mail, chat rooms, and a software library where visitors can get
free or low-cost computer programs. In February, Lycos acquired
Tripod Inc., a Williamstown, Mass. company that provides free
personal Web pages to more than a million people. Davis says that
Tripod and other new features are leading Web surfers to spend more
time at Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were originally a go-through site. ... The success of Lycos
was based on how soon you left,'' Davis says. ``Now we've become a
destination site.''
</P>
<P>
   In Marlborough, Mass., the staff at AltaVista is heading in the
same direction. AltaVista is a high-powered Internet search service
created in 1995 by Digital Equipment Corp. to show off the speed of
its Alpha computers. Today, AltaVista is still one of the most
popular search sites on the Web, but the company has lagged in
converting itself into a portal.
</P>
<P>
   No more, says director of marketing Kathy Greenler. Even before
Digital's acquisition last week by Compaq Computer Corp., AltaVista
had begun making moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've taken a slower path, but we've taken a global
perspective,'' Greenler says.
</P>
<P>
   AltaVista has begun to offer the same kinds of services
available at other portals. The AltaVista site now features a link
to ABC News and CBS Sportsline and a free e-mail service. But
Greenler is especially proud of the site's translation
capabilities. AltaVista can make rough translations into English of
Web pages written in French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, and
German. It can also translate English pages into any of these
languages.
</P>
<P>
   If search services can count on high traffic volumes, the makers
of browser software might have an even sweeter deal. The leading
browsers from Netscape and Microsoft are usually preset so that the
first Web site to appear on a screen belongs to the browser maker.
</P>
<P>
   That's too good an opportunity for Netscape, which is reeling
from Microsoft's competitive thrusts in the browser and server
software markets. Netscape is turning its Netcenter Web site into a
portal in hopes that visitors will linger to use the free e-mail
and discussion groups.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape senior vice president Jennifer Bailey says that 5.5
million Web surfers have registered to use the site since it was
opened in September. In the quarter ended in April, Netcenter
racked up $31 million in revenues from advertisers wishing to reach
those visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Netscape brand is by far more recognized and associated
with the Internet than any other portal brand out there, including
Yahoo,'' Bailey says.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft hopes to change that. Already the company runs several
of the most popular Web sites. Now Microsoft is testing a prototype
for a new portal called Internet Start, which will pop up on the
screens of future users of Microsoft's browsing software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to be the home for Microsoft customers on the
Internet,'' says Ed Graczyk, a Microsoft product manager. He sounds
modest enough until you remember that ``Microsoft customers'' are
about 90 percent of the world's computer users.
</P>
<P>
   Now established media companies, eager not to be shut out of the
Internet, are moving to make portals of their own. While Disney's
investment in Infoseek is the bigger of the two recent deals, NBC's
choice of a partner is more interesting. Infoseek is already a
major Web site, while Snap isn't in the top 25. NBC is betting that
its marketing clout can turn a little-known Web site into a
top-tier portal.
</P>
<P>
   ``NBC knows about audiences and mass marketing,'' says NBC
spokesman Robert Silverman. Besides, according to Silverman, less
than 5 percent of Americans have ever heard of Yahoo, largely
because most people still don't use the Internet. Silverman sees
this as evidence that there's still plenty of room in the portal
market.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, any number of other firms are trying to create
mini-portals &UR;  &LR; for specialized audiences. For example, the leading
personal finance software firm Intuit Inc. offers Quicken.com, a
site laden with financial news and information.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, everybody agrees that only a few of these
companies will get enough regular visitors to attract a profitable
level of ad revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there'll be three winners _ Yahoo, AOL, and
Microsoft,'' says Chris Charron, an analyst at Forrester Research
in Cambridge. He also gives an outside chance to Netscape because
of the popularity of its browser.
</P>
<P>
   As for the other players, including Lycos and AltaVista, Charron
sees them as also-rans, and possibly as takeover bait for a media
company looking to build its own gateway to the Internet.

</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Bad gene may temper the desire to light up &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Life isn't fair. Some people can eat and not get fat, others can
smoke and not get addicted. With smoking, researchers have now
discovered why.
</P>
<P>
   Nonsmokers and casual smokers, it turns out, are twice as likely
to have a defective gene for a liver enzyme called CYP2A6 that
breaks down nicotine, the addictive chemical in cigarette and cigar
smoke. That means nicotine stays in their system longer, blunting
the desire to smoke more to keep blood levels high.
</P>
<P>
   ``The principle is that people who remove nicotine more slowly
have to refuel less often,'' said Rachel Tyndale of the University
of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Smokers with the defective enzyme smoked 20 percent fewer
cigarettes per week than those who didn't, Tyndale, Dr. Edward
Sellers, and Michael Pianezza report in the current British journal
Nature.
</P>
<P>
   But how would a defective enzyme prevent people from becoming
smokers in the first place?
</P>
<P>
   ``In people who are naive to nicotine, it tends to cause
dizziness or nausea,'' Tyndale said. ``As you learn to smoke you
get tolerant to those effects. We think people with a reduced
ability to remove nicotine are tipped toward finding it even more
aversive. When they have a second cigarette, they still have more
nicotine around, which reduces their desire to continue.''

   The Toronto report represents the first time researchers have
discovered a genetic basis for smoking risks _ a behavior that,
according to earlier studies of twins, appears to be about half due
to social environment and half by genetic factors.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery suggests ways to help some of the 62 million
Americans who smoke to stop. First, by blocking the normal
nicotine-clearing enzyme (which apparently has no other critical
role in the body), scientists hope to convert a 30-cigarettes-a-day
smoker to a 10-a-day habit. ``It's much easier to quit if you're
smoking less,'' Tyndale notes.
</P>
<P>
   The enzyme blocker could also be a boon in preventing relapses
among quitters. ``We think in those people we can, especially in
high-risk situations like a social event or during stress,
reproduce the protective effect we see in nonsmokers with the
defective enzyme when they try to smoke,'' Tyndale says.

 &UR; How pneumonia hits in nursing homes
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Dr. Daniel M. Musher, a Houston physician, tells in the current
New England Journal of Medicine about his medical-student
daughter's reaction to the news of an outbreak of pneumococcal
pneumonia at a Texas nursing home last winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``How is that possible?'' she asked. ``Hadn't all the residents
of the nursing home been vaccinated?''
</P>
<P>
   Nope. And that's not uncommon in US nursing homes, judging from
a study in this week's issue of the journal.
</P>
<P>
   The study details an ``explosive'' outbreak of pneumonia in an
Oklahoma nursing home in February 1996, involving a strain of
pneumococcus resistant to many drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 84 residents of the rural nursing home, only three had
been vaccinated against pneumonia. Eleven residents developed the
lung disease, and three died.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pneumococcal disease accounts for more deaths than any other
vaccine-preventable disease,'' Dr. J. Pekka Nuorti and co-workers
write. Since 1990, they note, drug-resistant strains have become
increasingly common, making treatment difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Inertia among doctors and nursing home staff is largely the
reason why ``some public health recommendations that are so well
known to medical students are so poorly implemented,'' Musher
writes in an editorial, adding that it will probably take public
pressure to wake up the professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was, after all, the Rev. Cotton Mather who urged the
adoption of smallpox (vaccination) in the 18th century over the
objection of Boston's medical establishment.''

</P>

   Another form of drug resistance is the focus of articles in
today's Journal of the American Medical Association.Resistant forms
of the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS, are
increasingly common. A panel of 13 experts is calling for
resistance testing among some groups, such as HIV-infected pregnant
women, to warn doctors when to use drugs that will still work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We desperately need more prevalence data in a variety of
places before we can make accurate recommendations on what
physicians should do,'' said Dr. Martin Hirsch, a Boston AIDS
specialist who chaired the group.

HARLEM AGENCY`S PRESIDENT STRIKES RIGHT BALANCE 
</HEADLINE>

 By PETER G. GOSSELIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe

<P>
   NEW YORK _ For a teenage Deborah C. Wright, growing up the
eldest daughter of a black Baptist minister in the South meant a
life full of givens. Chief among them: attending Atlanta's Spelman
College, the proper school for generations of middle-class
African-American women.
</P>
<P>
   But Wright would have none of it; she would go to Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew my dad was upset when he offered me a car if I wouldn't
go north,'' laughed Wright, now 40 and president of the Upper
Manhattan Empowerment Zone, the agency charged with doling out $550
million in public funds to help jump-start Harlem's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Wright has made a specialty of such cautious, finessed
rebellions, ones that shake up those close to her, but that let her
reach from one world into another. It is a talent that could serve
her well as she tries to bridge the gap between high finance and
grinding poverty, between &UR;  &LR; a white elite and a black underclass, to
help lift up Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   When it was time for Wright to pick a career, her family assumed
she would follow her famous aunt, social activist and FOH (Friend
of Hillary) Marion Wright Edelman, and go to law school. But to
their dismay, she discovered that her real passion was business.
(She compromised by earning advanced degrees in both law and
business, both at Harvard.)
</P>
<P>
   When it was time to go to work, she landed one of the hottest
jobs at the hottest firms of the 1980s: corporate finance at First
Boston Inc. But she threw it over for a modest marketing position
with a nonprofit housing agency.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, with her job as politically and racially sensitive
as any in this notoriously sensitive city, she continues to buck
the expected. After finishing work in poor black Harlem, she takes
what for almost anybody else would be a politically suicidal step:
She goes home to predominantly white and trendy Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the pattern, friends and colleagues seemed offended,
insisting it reflects no uncertainty or conflict in Wright. But
Wright herself had a different reaction. ``There's no question,''
she said. ``There's a duality.'' And to all appearances, it has
been there from the outset.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Wright is the product of two very different
worlds: a child of rural and static Bennettsville, S.C., who came
of age in the upheaval of the civil right movement; and a daughter
of the town's leading black pastor who is also the niece of one of
America's fiercest liberal advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the friction between those worlds is still apparent
today in what her father and aunt have to say about Wright's early
life and their roles.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Harry S. Wright, who is now minister of the Cornerstone
Baptist Church in Crown Heights, said his daughter was a ``very
determined and impatient'' young person for whom he sought to
provide ``a stable presence'' and ``some sense of sanity.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Edelman, founder and president of the Children's
Defense Fund, one of the nation's most forceful advocacy groups,
described her niece as someone with ``great grit'' who ``challenged
the segregated mores of the town far more than her parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright's challenges have traced the arc of a generation of
African Americans from activism to protest to separation and back.
Her class was the first to attend Bennettsville's formerly
all-white elementary school. When her sixth-grade principal refused
to lower the flag after the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s
assassination, she led a walkout. By the time she'd finished
Radcliffe, she had retreated into a black enclave. She remembers
her mother remarking at graduation that she had not introduced any
white friends, and Wright responding, ``I don't have any.''
</P>
<P>
   Her return to the mainstream was too abrupt. Not long after
leaving Harvard, she found herself a $135,000-a-year investment
banker and deeply unhappy. ``She told me she'd spent eight years
preparing for a professional life that she didn't want,'' said
Kathyrn S. Wylde, who was running a nonprofit housing agency at the
time and is now chief executive of the New York City Investment
Fund. ``She was profoundly shaken by that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wright recovered her footing, first in a $35,000-a-year job
with Wlyde's group; then in a series of high-profile positions for
both Democratic Mayor David Dinkins and his Republican successor
Rudolph Giuliani; and now as empowerment zone president.
</P>
<P>
   Even critics say she is maintaining a near-perfect mix of
combativeness and conciliation in her current job, a vital
ingredient for someone with millions of dollars to give away, but a
wild array of political factions to appease.
</P>
<P>
   Wright herself traces the ability to her long search or the
proper balance between the minister and the advocate in her
life.``I feel like I spend 80 percent of my time trying to find the
middle ground on the spectrum from Dad to Marion,'' she said.

IN HARLEM A CRUCIAL TEST FOR PRIVATE ENTERPRISE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS

 By PETER G. GOSSELIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The last time Sikhulu Shange, proprietor of the
Record Shack on Harlem's 125th Street, felt threatened by
development, he blamed it on Racism. This time, he blames it on
Capitalism. In the strange alchemy of urban revitalization, that's
progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are lambs to the slaughter,'' 57-year-old Shange declared
recently. ``We are being driven from existence,'' he said of his
tiny shop, which was at the center of a violent outburst three
years ago when the white store owner from whom he sublet space
tried to evict him in order to expand.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of Shange's new worry is a 265,000-square-foot mall
scheduled to begin rising this summer in the heart of this poor
black community, the first substantial commercial project here in
more than 70 years. It will house an HMV record store that Shange
fears will entice away his customers and a host of other upscale
retailers that have never done business before in a place like
Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   The mall is emerging as a giant test of America's renewed faith
in free markets, and especially of its conviction that private
forces, egged on by substantial tax breaks and low-interest loans,
can reverse the kind of urban blight that a generation of public
programs and billions of dollars of taxpayer money have not.
</P>
<P>
   It is a test as well of a new generation of black leaders who
are often more educated, more affluent, and more at ease with the
business ethos of the era than their predecessors, and one that is
surprisingly, almost shockingly, casual about gestures and
alliances that have largely defined race relations in America since
the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have three, perhaps five, years to prove this thing can
succeed, no more,'' said Deborah C. Wright, the three-time Harvard
graduate (Harvard College, Harvard Law, Harvard Business School)
and president of the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, the agency
responsible for using hundreds of millions of dollars in public
funds to encourage private revitalization of Harlem. ``We can't
give money to people who can't put together a business plan or make
a financial target, no matter how deserving or who they know.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the people almost certain to be looking for money is
Shange. One of the most politically charged decisions Wright is
likely to make is on how to handle his request.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To watch television, where six of the top 10 network shows are
now set in cities, you'd think that urban America is back. To
listen to some business and government leaders, you'd think that
poor urban America is well on its way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inner cities offer market opportunities that are greater than
most countries' and that is beginning to be recognized,'' said
Harvard Business professor Michael E. Porter, who has made himself
a spokesman for private sector revitalization of urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   But inner-city opportunities have yet to produce many results.
Whether they can will be most prominently decided in Harlem _
arguably the nation's best-known inner city, the emotional home
base to millions of African Americans, and a place where the forces
of decline and revival are squared off as almost nowhere else.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most heavily patrolled sections of New York, it has a
murder rate that is still twice the citywide average. Only a
10-minute subway ride from the corporate headquarters of Midtown,
it has an unemployment rate that is four times the national
average. Some streets are lined with elegant brownstones, but
almost one third of its buildings are abandoned. Some affluent
families have begun to return, but more than one third of its
households remain on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   To tackle these problems, ``We're trying to build businesses and
create jobs, not expand social service bureaucracies and erect
monuments to government,'' said New York's Republican governor,
George E. Pataki, whose administration provides Wright's agency
with one third of its funding. ``If our approach can succeed in
Harlem, then there is absolutely no reason it can't succeed
elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One measure of the odds against it succeeding can be found in
the story of what happened at the Record Shack three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The current revitalization effort did not begin with Congress's
1993 passage of empowerment zone legislation, but with a series of
skirmishes between street vendors and police along 125th Street
that ended in murder and arson. City officials insisted then that
they were simply trying to maintain order, but some Harlem
residents saw the plight of the black vendors as part of a larger
struggle to free Harlem from what they believed to be its mostly
white store owners.
</P>
<P>
   The battle lines hardened in late 1995 when the white owner of
Freddy's Fashion Mart on 125th Street, Fred A. Harari, told one of
the few black store owners that he could no longer sublet space.
The black owner was Record Shack owner Shange.

 NEW YORK: ... owner Shange.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shange said recently that, now as then, he believes ``people
have the right to protest when there is an injustice towards
them.'' When he protested Harari's move, angry picketers appeared
in front of Freddy's.
</P>
<P>
   Then on a cold day in December, Roland J. Smith Jr., a one-time
vendor, picketer, and self-described black revolutionary, took
matters into his own hands. He entered Freddy's with a .38-caliber
handgun, wounded four people, set a fire in which seven perished,
and shot himself in the chest. The memory of the massacre still
haunts 125th Street. In a similar episode two months ago, a black
man threatened to firebomb a white-owned store across the street.
When police caught up with him, they discovered his duffel bag
contained an AK-47 assault rifle, seven banana clips, a .22-caliber
pistol, a two-way radio, and a ski mask.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One pattern that often emerges after violent outbursts like the
Freddy's attack is that the government pumps money into programs to
revitalize poor communities. A second is that the programs almost
invariably fail. To almost everyone's amazement, that hasn't
happened here _ at least so far.
</P>
<P>
   On its face, the current revitalization effort looks a lot like
previous ones, a government program that promises to use public
dollars to lure private business, but often wind up spending its
money on ancillary things like housing, social services, and
politically connected projects.
</P>
<P>
   However, there are two differences here. First, officials are
actually spending the bulk of their funds on businesses like the
new mall. Second, they are beginning to argue what until recently
would have been heretical in Harlem: that what the community really
needs to do is get ready to compete in the mainstream capitalist
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard for African Americans to wholly embrace capitalism
because we started out in the system as slaves, but the truth is
it's the only thing you can count on,'' said Wright, the
empowerment zone president. ``We've tried the legal system and
we've tried the political system, and that's gotten us part of the
way. But we've got a very, very long way to go,'' she said. ``I
don't see that we have much of an option but to make our peace with
capitalism.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Wright and her colleagues can offer the community a
considerable cushion against the rigors of capitalist competition _
almost $550 million in publicly funded grants, low-interest loans,
and tax breaks over the next 10 years. But their call for Harlem to
get over its problem with free markets is more than rhetoric; to
the shock of some local business people, they have begun enforcing
some rudimentary standards of the mainstream economy.
</P>
<P>
   When Dorothy Pitman Hughes, a politically connected community
activist and owner of Harlem Office Supply, applied for a loan two
years ago, she was rejected. ``Debbie Wright told me the
reason...is I'm not a good businesswoman,'' Hughes said. Hughes
admitted owing $23,000 in back taxes.
</P>
<P>
   How empowerment zone officials have managed to take such action
when it is so at odds with what most of Harlem was saying and doing
about its problems only a few years ago is hard to explain. More
than anything else, it appears to be that residents believe the
officials' promise to land something big for the community. And the
first and crucial ``something'' is Harlem USA, a $65 million
glass-walled mall that will house a nine-screen Loews theater, an
Old Navy clothing store, a Modell's sporting goods store, an New
York Sports Club gym, and a Disney store, as well as an HMV
Records.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of the mall, together with a Pathmark supermarket
going up nearby, is almost impossible to overstate, according to
local leaders. Upper Manhattan (which includes the Harlem, East
Harlem, Washington Heights, and Inwood sections) has 520,000
residents, or only slightly fewer than Boston. But is has only one
movie house, and no full-sized supermarkets, upscale clothing
stores, or chain record stores.
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody is thrilled with the progress. People like Hughes
see a dark purpose in the empowerment zone's strategy. ``They are
trying to move the mass of black people out of Harlem as part of
gentrification,'' asserted the office supply store owner. Hispanic
store owners almost succeeded in killing the Pathmark supermarket
because Abyssinian Development was involved in the project and
Abyssinian is black.
</P>
<P>
   Still with the coming of the mall, something fundamental is
changing in Harlem and nobody knows it better than record store
owner Shange. After complaining recently about the project's
failure to respect ``the essence of the community'' and its
``onslaught against community-based businesses'' such as his, he
abruptly switched gears.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a different ballgame,'' he said of the mall and the HMV
record store. ``It's just another business competing with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Shange is willing to go head-to-head with HMV, but he said needs
something in order to do it. ``Working capital.''
Two-hundred-thousand dollars of it. And he wants it from the
empowerment zone.
</P>
<P>
   Told of the figure, Wright remarked, ``That's an awful lot of
working capital for a little record store.'' Perhaps, but this is
the question that has got to be in the back of her mind: Is it an
awful lot for racial calm?

ASTRONOMY TEAM FINDS NEW PLANET BIGGER THAN JUPITER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The world's champion planet-finders have
discovered another new world, one tantalizingly close to Earth's
doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   Two San Francisco State University astronomers and two of their
colleagues found the planet orbiting a star called Gliese 876, 15
light-years away. It is far closer than any previously known
extrasolar planet, or one outside Earth's solar system.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of an extrasolar world so close to our own, and
orbiting such a low-mass star, implies the galaxy is even more
jam-packed with these planets than previously believed, said lead
researcher Geoffrey Marcy of San Francisco State.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's by far the closest star around which any planet has been
found,'' Marcy said Wednesday. The previous closest-known
extrasolar planet orbits a star about 35 light-years away. A
light-year is 5.9 trillion miles, the distance light travels in one
year.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the star is unusually low in mass to have its own planet.
``It's by far the faintest star around which a planet has been
found,'' Marcy said. The star is too faint to be seen with the
naked eye, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The star's size is another hint that extrasolar planets may be
common throughout the galaxy, Marcy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the stars in the galaxy are these little puny stars
that are a tenth to a third the mass of our sun,'' he said. ``It
certainly tells us that low-mass stars can harbor planets, and so
there may be many more planets in the galaxy.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the seventh planet find since 1995 for Marcy and his
associates. So far, 12 such planets have been found by the world's
astronomers.
</P>
<P>
   The latest planet was detected using one of the two giant Keck
Observatory telescopes atop Mauna Kea on the big island of Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   The planet was not seen directly by Marcy and his colleagues.
Rather, they detected subtle wobbles in the star's motion caused by
the back-and-forth gravitational tug of the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Marcy's other partners in the discovery are Paul Butler of the
Anglo-Australian Observatory in Australia, Steve Vogt of the
University of California at Santa Cruz and Debra Fischer of San
Francisco State.
</P>
<P>
   The planet is about 1.8 times as large as Jupiter, the biggest
planet in our solar system, Marcy said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he described it to colleagues at an astronomy conference
in Canada this month.
</P>
<P>
   Although this is Marcy and his associates' seventh planet
discovery, the quest hasn't gotten dull.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what Paul Butler and I have devoted our lives to,'' Marcy
said. ``We don't have kids. We work until midnight at this. This is
what we're after in life. The main thing we like to do is to find
more planets.''
</P>
<P>
   On May 28, astronomer Susan Terebey and her colleagues at a
private research firm in Pasadena announced they had used the
Hubble Space Telescope to spot what might be an extrasolar planet
escaping from a star system about 450 light-years from Earth.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Marcy reacted cautiously to Terebey's claim. Her
planet explanation ``is only one of several interpretations'' of
the object, he said. ``The jury is certainly still out. One of the
leading alternative interpretations is that it's a background
star.''

 &HT;    CHICANOS AND MEXICANS EXPLORE SIMILARITIES, DIFFERENCES IN
MEXICO CITY
 &HT;    With photo placed in the International folder on the Cox Server.

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Maybe it's the fact that she favors whole-grain
cereal in the morning over ``pan dulce,'' traditional Mexican sweet
bread.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's the jolt she felt when she scanned newspaper ads here
and found companies openly demanding job applicants who were
``unmarried, pretty girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Certain things Monica Sahagun has experienced in Mexico remind
her that many of her sensibilities were shaped by her Southern
California upbringing -- although Spanish was her first language,
she was raised by Mexican parents and, as she puts its, she
``camouflages'' herself well here.
</P>
<P>
   Sahagun is a Mexican-American living in Mexico City, and an
organizer of the first meeting to be held in Mexico City of a U.S.
academic group, the National Association for Chicana and Chicano
Studies.
</P>
<P>
   An underlying theme at the June 24-27 conference is an
exploration not just of the ties that bind Mexicans and Chicanos,
but also the cultural clashes and mutual resentment that sometimes
plague their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has a special attraction for Mexican-Americans, and even
though they've heard stories from their immigrant relatives about
hardship and corruption, Mexico's culture is familiar enough to
many to make them feel at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here for survival of the ``alma,'' the soul,'' said
Sahagun.
</P>
<P>
   With the population and political clout of Mexican-Americans
growing, the Mexican government has taken more of an interest in
the Chicano community in the United States. Mexico's Congress
recently voted to allow Mexican-born U.S. citizens or their
children to regain their Mexican nationality, a decision that might
allow some to eventually vote in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   And through the art exhibits and panels convened by this
conference, organizers hope, more Mexicans may be persuaded to put
aside their sometimes snobbish views of Chicanos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot of Chicano conferences in places like Germany,
Holland and Spain. It's about time Mexicans had a conference for us
here,''' said Maria Herrera-Sobek, a Chicano Studies instructor at
the University of California, Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   Sobek travels to Mexico often for research on her speciality,
``corridos,'' Mexican folk songs. She believes Mexicans are growing
less judgmental of Chicanos, who are sometimes mocked here for not
speaking Spanish perfectly or for showing an interest in
traditional Mexican music and art that some urbane Mexicans find
old-fashioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're beginning to be seen here as something other than
traitors who crossed the border,'' Herrera-Sobek said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet differences persist.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference held recently in Mexico City to promote the
Chicano Studies meeting, some Mexican journalists were irritated
that the program appeared to be mostly in English, although
translation would be provided.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers patiently pointed out that English is the dominant
tongue of many Chicano scholars because they live and work as
professionals in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``To Mexicans, Chicanos are like the great tome, 'Don Quixote.'
All Mexicans know about 'Don Quixote,' but few have ever read it.
Likewise, Chicanos are known, but rarely studied or understood,''
said Alex Ramirez, a Mexican conference organizer and professor of
Chicano Studies at Mexico's Autonomous National University.
</P>
<P>
   At a Chicano art exhibit hosted by the conference, some Mexicans
were startled by paintings and etchings that blended symbols of
ancient Mexico with low rider cars or scenes from U.S. Latino
barrios.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why so much nostalgia for Mexico?'' asked a puzzled Margarita
Martinez, a Mexico City elementary school teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Margo Gutierrez, a Latino Studies librarian at the University of
Texas, Austin, said, ``Being Chicano and coming to Mexico or living
in Mexico can be a poignant experience. Mexicans sometimes don't
know what to make of us.''
</P>
<P>
   For young Chicano students, she added, attending a Chicano
Studies conference in Mexico offers a healthy dose of reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of them idealize Mexican culture, and that's natural.
It's part of their roots,'' she said. ``So it's good for them to
come here and see how different Mexico is, yet appreciate where
they came from and celebrate the good things that we have
maintained.''
</P>
<P>
   Maryana Carsillo, who is studying Chicano and Latin American
literature at the UC-Irvine, said Chicanos seem to ``either hold on
really tight, or let go'' of Mexican culture as they try to sort
out their identity.
</P>
<P>
   As a child in Los Angeles, she said, she realized she wasn't
really as Mexican as Mexicans when she would visit her cousins each
summer in Guadalajara.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my cousins would tell me jokes in Spanish, I realized I
couldn't tell them back to them,'' she said. ``And they thought you
were being stuck-up when you mixed English into your Spanish.''
</P>
<P>
   Raquel Marquez, a Ph.D. student in sociology at UT, grew up on
the border, closer to Mexico, and in her work she regularly blends
both worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Marquez was in Mexico City for a panel called ``Mexicanas and
Chicanas Bridging Two Worlds: A Study of Poverty on the
Texas-Mexico Border.''
</P>
<P>
   Her research takes her back to Brownsville, Texas, where she
grew up, and over to Matamoros, in Mexico, where she gathers life
histories of women on both sides of the frontier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love traveling in Mexico,'' she said. ``The culture shock is
only what you make of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chicano Studies Association is 25 years old, and reflects a
scholarship that grew out of the 1960s civil rights movement to
recognize Chicano history and ethnicity. About 600 U.S. students
and teachers signed up to come to the Mexico conference, along with
dozens of Mexican researchers and speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of panels addressed subjects as diverse as ``Violence and
Militarization on the Mexico-U.S. Border'' to ``A Catholic Church
and its Role in the Barrio.''
</P>
<P>
   Several panels on gay Chicanos, gender conflict and the
generally favorable Chicano reaction to the Zapatista rebel
movement in Mexico's southern state of Chiapas tread on sensitive
ground in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Chicanos have followed the Zapatista Indian uprising in Chiapas
with interest and support, said Monica Sahagun. After living in
Mexico for a year, she said, she now compares the Chicano community
in the United States with the dispossessed Indians in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education, health care, work -- the demands are the same,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sahagun, who works as a translator for the Mexican news agency
Notimex, performed a one-woman show about bilingualism and
biculturalism to help open the Chicano Studies conference here.
</P>
<P>
   She danced to Mexican folk music and to Chicano rap, and slid
effortlessly between Spanish and English while describing how she
balances between ``hot and cold, happy and sad, English and
Spanish.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My world has always been double,'' she said.

<P>
   BEIJING _ Mao Tse-Tung's ghostly portrait beamed down on
Tiananmen Square as China prepared an ear-splitting 21-gun salute
Saturday for the American president Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton began his China tour with robed dancers and
heart-thudding drumbeats at China's old imperial capital of Xi'an
on Thursday night, but the events on Saturday at Beijing's infamous
downtown square will be the centerpiece of his nine-day visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If China will cooperate with America, then nobody can defeat
China,'' said Wei Wenqing, 86, on the day President Clinton became
the first U.S. leader in a decade to land on Chinese soil. The
gnarled pensioner was out for an afternoon walk on the exact spot
where Clinton is due to receive the ceremonial Tiananmen Square
greeting that the U.S. House of Representatives urged the president
to refuse.
</P>
<P>
   Workers could be seen polishing the brass doors of the Great
Hall of the People. This massive parliament building, which
resembles an over-grown Soviet-built subway station, will be the
television backdrop as Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin
stride down a formation of People's Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers
on the eastern edge of the world's biggest public square.
</P>
<P>
   If China's past practice is followed, the troops Clinton reviews
will be carrying highly polished fixed bayonets.
</P>
<P>
   Following the 15-minute outdoor ceremony, Clinton and the
71-year-old Jiang are due to mount a set of stone steps leading
into the Great Hall of the People for the first session of their
Beijing summit conference.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-gun salute Clinton will receive is an honor that China
reserves for a rarefied group of foreign leaders it regards as
especially worth cultivating. In this decade they have included
Japanese Emperor Akihito in 1992, King Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia
in 1994, Russian President Boris Yeltsin in 1997 and Bulgarian
President Petur Stoyanov last month.
</P>
<P>
   Except for hauling in some extra flower pots, the Chinese seemed
to be making no effort to prettify the square that to many in
America symbolizes the Chinese Communist Party's cold-blooded
suppression of the 1989 student-led pro-democracy movement.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, along one of the main streets bordering the square there
hangs a big blue propaganda billboard saying in English and
Chinese, ``Devote Our Great Efforts To Build Up The Socialist
Spiritual Foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Clinton will make any gesture in memory of the victims
of the Tiananmen crackdown is one of many question marks hovering
over this summit.
</P>
<P>
   The official welcome Saturday will be a stiff and formal affair
compared to the glorious extravaganza the Chinese staged on
Thursday night, little more than an hour after President and Mrs.
Clinton and their daughter Chelsea flew into the 600-year-old
former imperial capital of Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
   China's state television broke into its main evening news show
at 7:15 p.m. (China time) to announce that Air Force One had
landed. Until that interruption the news anchor hadn't mentioned
the Clinton visit, and the 10 p.m. news didn't give it very good
billing -- it was the fifth item reported, after news about such
momentous events as Prime Minister Zhu Rongji's visit to a drug
exhibit and a performance by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   At the colorful Xi'an show in front of the city's towering old
South Gate, which featured huge red lanterns, lithe dancers in
gauzy dresses and performers marching in through billows of smoke,
Clinton made oblique reference to some of the political
controversies studding his trip before it even began.
</P>
<P>
   ``Respect for the worth, the dignity, the potential and the
freedom of every citizen is a vital source of America's strength
and success,'' he told the select crowd of about 1,000 invited
onlookers, raising thoughts of the human rights issues so sensitive
here.
</P>
<P>
   And he added that providing all people opportunities to develop
``is vital to the strength and success of the new China, as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports that authorities arrested several dissidents in the days
leading up to Clinton's arrival added to the strain attending this
visit.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said he anticipates U.S.
Ambassador James Sasser ``will bring this up directly with the
Chinese government'' on Friday. He also said Clinton will encourage
China to permit free political dialogue when he holds formal talks
with Chinese President Jiang on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Before heading on to the controversial Tiananmen Square welcome,
Clinton will spend the day in Xi'an Friday, first touring the
resting place of more than 7,000 ancient terra cotta warriors,
horses and chariots, the 2,000-year-old wonder unearthed little
more than 20 years ago. Then he will talk to leaders of a local
village before heading on to Beijing on Friday night.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Some of the high points and low points in the
two-century relationship between the United States and China:
</P>
<P>
   1800-1820 _ Opium Trade. American merchant ships, many belonging
to Russell &AMP; Co. and other respectable Boston shipowners, join the
British in smuggling Indian opium to Chinese ports to feed the
addiction of 1 million Chinese, in return for Chinese silks and
spices and tea.
</P>
<P>
   1821 _ Terranova Incident. A crewman of the U.S. merchant ship
docked in Canton harbor accidentally drops an earthenware pitcher
that kills a Chinese fruit seller. The ship's captain, afraid that
his illegal opium cargo will be confiscated, surrenders the man.
The crewman, named Terranova, is executed after a secret one-day
Chinese trial, causing outrage in America.
</P>
<P>
   1843 _ Treaty Rights. American President John Tyler sends
Massachusetts Congressman Caleb Cushing as an emissary to the
Chinese imperial court. Cushing concludes the Treaty of Wanghia,
granting American merchants extra-territorial rights in five
Chinese ports. The treaty also opens China to American missionaries
by allowing American-run ``hospitals, churches and cemeteries.''
</P>
<P>
   1865-1880 _ Coolie Labor. Chinese by the tens of thousands
immigrate to the United States, most to work in labor gangs
building America's western railroads. Without the Chinese, ``it
would be impossible to complete the Western portion of this great
national enterprise within the time required by Congress,'' the
governor of California writes to President Andrew Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   1880-1900 _ ``Yellow Peril.'' Unemployed American whites spread
hatred against Chinese immigrants, culminating in scalpings of
Chinese workers in Montana and other western states. U.S. Congress
restricts immigration by Chinese, and the Chinese population in the
United States drops from 110,000 to 60,000.
</P>
<P>
   1908 _ Chinese Students. U.S. Congress allocates $12 million to
bring Chinese students to the United States. Over the next two
decades, 1,268 Chinese scholars study in America.
</P>
<P>
   1940-1945 _ Flying Tigers. With Japan occupying the northern
Chinese region of Manchuria, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's
administration authorizes ex-U.S. Army officer Claire Chennault to
recruit ``the Flying Tigers,'' an unofficial force of American
pilots. Their combat missions from Chinese bases against Japanese
fighters eventually help expel Japan from China.
</P>
<P>
   1949 _ Communist takeover. The United States does not recognize
the new communist regime of Mao Tse-tung.
</P>
<P>
   January 1950 _ Green Light? Public declarations by the Truman
Administration define a new Pacific ``defense perimeter'' that does
not include Taiwan or South Korea among America's key strategic
interests. Republicans later charge that Truman gave communist
forces a green light to attack South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   June 25, 1950 _ Korean War. North Korean armies strike south
across the 38th Parallel and capture South Korea's capital, Seoul,
drawing Truman to order U.S. troops into combat to help South
Korea. After an initial stalemate, China joins the invasion,
sending 700,000 troops into South Korea. Chinese ``human wave''
tactics cause revulsion in America.
</P>
<P>
   July 1953 _ Nuclear Threat. Korean war ends in an armistice,
following a veiled threat by President Dwight Eisenhower to bomb
China with nuclear weapons. America's Korean War losses reach
54,000 dead and 103,000 wounded, Chinese casualties reached
800,000.
</P>
<P>
   1957 _ Nuclear Tension. United States deploys nuclear-armed
Matador missiles on Taiwan. Mao gave a cold-blooded riposte: ``If
the worst came to the worst and half of mankind died, the other
half would remain while imperialism would be razed to the ground
and the whole world would become socialist.''
</P>
<P>
   February 1972 _ Isolation Ends. President Richard Nixon visits
China, ending two decades of U.S.-China hostility. Nixon's trip
brings about a rapprochement that has continued, with fits and
starts, until now.

   BEIJING _ The enigmatic Chinese leadership that awaits President
Bill Clinton is like a carriage hitched to three galloping
stallions: one sturdy, one limping, one flashy.
</P>
<P>

   Why not become your own amateur China-watcher? Just tune in
events over the next two days and scrutinize these four big steeds
of the Chinese Communist Party politburo.
</P>
<P>
   You can bet that every professional China follower around the
world will be glued to the coverage of Clinton during his 21-gun
greeting at Tiananmen Square and the banquet later in the Great
Hall of the People. They'll be watching for bits of byplay, body
language and facial expressions to gain insight into such questions
as these:
</P>
<P>
   How will these four cunning survivors of a generation of
sometimes deadly party intrigue interact with each other, and with
the Clinton entourage? Which of the three leading rivals-in-harness
really pulls the most weight? Are they pulling in different
directions? Who will be ``in'' and who will be ``out'' by the year
2000?
</P>
<P>
   China is run by a self-perpetuating, secretive and extremely
status-conscious leadership collective.
</P>
<P>
   Those with real power number only about 200, of which more than
180 are men. They are the chieftains of China's ruling communist
party, along with a dwindling cadre of retired revolutionary elders
in their 80s and 90s. (Most of those not yet retired hold second
hats as cabinet ministers, province chiefs, or generals of the
People's Liberation Army.)
</P>
<P>
   On questions as crucial as how to handle the Clinton visit, a
rough consensus will have to emerge among all China's collective
leadership, and especially among the roughly 20 members of the
party's ruling politburo. The leaders who matter the most in
shaping any consensus are the seven men who make up the politburo's
Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Of these ``big seven'' in the politburo's inner sanctum, the
most interesting to watch during the Clinton visit are:
</P>
<P>
   _ The sturdy work horse: State President Jiang Zemin, 71, who
ranks first in the politburo and also chairs the vital Central
Military Commission. China-watchers used to deride Jiang as ``the
flower-pot'' because he managed to look good without doing
anything. Others sneered at him as ``the weather vane'' because he
seemed to have no beliefs of his own. To their surprise, this bland
figure _ long viewed as a mere transitional leader put in after the
Tiananmen Square debacle _ has clung to the top job in the Chinese
communist party for nine years. That is longer than any party
general secretary since the Great Helmsman, Mao Tse-tung, who died
in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   _- The limping war horse: the chairman of the rubber-stamp
legislature, Li Peng, 69, who ranks second in the politburo. To
dissidents and foreign human rights monitors, Li is the ``butcher
of Beijing.'' As premier in May 1989, Li issued the infamous
martial law declaration that led to the Tiananmen massacre. Despite
worldwide excoriation, the party allowed this cautious hardliner to
serve out two full five-year terms as premier, the maximum allowed
by constitution. Then just three months ago Li stepped down as
premier to chair the National People's Congress, where he
occasionally receives second-level foreign deputations in his
quarters in the Great Hall of the People. Otherwise he is little
seen.
</P>
<P>
   _ The flashy race horse: The new premier Zhu Rongji, 69, who
ranks third in the politburo. The darling of today's Chinese
student generation and of many Western financiers, the hard-driving
``Boss Zhu'' is credited as the magician of China's economic growth
miracle. When Zhu was made ``economic czar'' in 1993, inflation was
soaring at 24 percent a year and China's dollar reserves were down
to a dangerous $20 billion. Using his own blend of market
mechanisms and a communist-style nonconvertible currency, Zhu
engineered a ``soft landing.'' He brought inflation to zero, kept
economic growth roaring and increased dollar reserves to $140
billion. Some have compared Zhu with Ludwig Erhard, the engineer of
Germany's post-war recovery. ``No matter what is waiting in front
of me _ whether it be land minds or an abyss _ I will blaze my
trail,'' Zhu said when he was promoted to premier three months ago.
Zhu's handicap: he lacks an independent power base and he's stepped
on too many toes. If the Chinese economy sours, Zhu could be put
out to pasture.
</P>
<P>
   -- The young horse: Vice President Hu Jintao, 55, the
fifth-ranking member of the politburo. Dubbed the ``golden boy''
and ``rising star'' of the politburo, Hu is the youngest in the
party's inner circle. He got there because of his tough, yet adroit
handling of separatist unrest in Tibet, where he became regional
party boss in 1989. Within a month of Hu's arrival in Tibet, the
death of the 10th Panchen Lama led to independence demonstrations.
By wielding a news blackout, tear gas and martial law, Hu snuffed
out the protests without embarrassing Beijing. Returning to the
capital in 1992, Hu immediately vaulted into the politburo standing
committee, reportedly on the say-so of then Chinese communist
patriarch Deng Xiaoping, who died in 1997. Barring a stumble, Hu is
on track to become the next communist party general secretary by
2002 and president of China by 2003.

 &HT;    SPORTS REPORTER FIRST IRANIAN WOMAN TO ATTEND SOCCER MATCH
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i ) International and (s ) Sports
categories.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox Newspapers 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ For this sports reporter to get the story, she
has to break the gender barrier in Iranian soccer.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Mahin Gorji became the first Iranian woman to attend a
soccer game here since the Islamic revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   She credits the new moderate Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
for making it possible, but it's still hard for a woman sports
reporter in a country where most sporting events are segregated by
gender.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud. I'm Iranian. I prove to men that women are
powerful,'' said the enthusiastic Gorji, a 29-year-old reporter
with the Jameah (Society) daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   While Iranian women can hold important jobs in Iran _ one is
vice president _ and are freer than women in countries nearby, they
still live under strict limits.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious rule is that they must wear a head scarf and
large cape or raincoat-styled covering, in keeping with ``modesty''
customs.
</P>
<P>
   Less obvious, but more important, women's court testimony is
worth only half that of men's and they automatically lose custody
of the children in a divorce, for which the husbands must give
approval.
</P>
<P>
   The sports rules seem arbitrary. Women cannot attend soccer
games or play organized soccer. They can attend men's basketball,
but are told it is too dangerous for them in a stadium of crazed
male soccer fans.
</P>
<P>
   Women can play several organized sports, but men cannot attend
when women are not fully covered. Men can attend women's canoeing,
skiing and shooting, but not volleyball or swimming.
</P>
<P>
   Gorji does not appear to be a trendsetter. While other Iranian
women are pushing the limits by wearing colorful head scarves far
back on their heads, she wears a traditional black hood and
repeatedly pulls it over her hair.
</P>
<P>
   But, she works at one of Iran's most progressive newspapers _
conservatives are attempting to close it down. She loves sports
and, in Iran, soccer is number one.
</P>
<P>
   When Iran hosted a soccer match against Kuwait in April, Gorji's
editor got permission from the government for her to attend.
</P>
<P>
   She said other reporters, players and coaches welcomed her, at
times too much.
</P>
<P>
   The Kuwaiti coach offered a handshake, but Gorji knew police
nearby would object to any physical contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, I'm sorry. I'm a Muslim. I'm not allowed to shake
your hand,''' she recalls.
</P>
<P>
   That game was in a small stadium in the Iranian city of Tabriz.
Gorji later covered a game in Tehran's 100,000-seat Azadi Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Indicative of current Iranian debate over how to reform Iran
nearly 20 years after the Islamic revolution, some praised Gorji.
But a female editor at Iran Sports, a sports daily, said she was
acting too much like Western women.
</P>
<P>
   Gorji, an avid volleyball and pick-up soccer player herself, is
bothered that other women cannot attend soccer matches.
</P>
<P>
   The desire is there. When the Iranian soccer team returned to
the country in December after qualifying for the World Cup
Tournament, several thousand women forced their way into the
stadium to honor the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not allowed to do something, you want to do it,''
she said. ``It's their right and I'm angry about it.''

HIGHER MINIMUM WAGE LEAVES LABOR-FRIENDLY MAYOR DIVIDED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHUCK FINNIE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A high-stakes, behind-the-scenes policy fight
over whether San Francisco should have the nation's highest minimum
wage for the employees of city contractors is testing Mayor Willie
Brown's strong ties to organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has tried negotiating a deal on the ``living-wage''
ordinance to make it palatable to all sides. On June 1, he met with
representatives of businesses and nonprofit agencies, which would
have to pay their workers the higher wages, and the labor unions
that support the ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   Differences over a possible living-wage law and other city
regulations have led both sides to talk of taking their cases to
voters in November through a ballot initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Brown wants to avoid a messy, costly campaign that is likely to
generate bitter feelingsand end with the loser continuing the
fight in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted them to set aside ballot measures so they could reach
an accord on something so basic as a living wage,'' Brown said
recently.
</P>
<P>
   A living wage, the cornerstone of labor's legislative agenda at
City Hall, is as complicated and politically loaded as any issue to
face the mayor during his two years in office.
</P>
<P>
   Led by the mayor's close political allies at the Service
Employees International Union, labor wants San Francisco to top
other municipalities that have passed living-wage laws, which set
pay minimums for the employees of those who do business with a city
or receive a municipal benefit, such as a grant.
</P>
<P>
   Neighboring Oakland has a rate of $8 per hour with health
benefits, or $9.25 without benefits, the highest of a half-dozen
cities in the country that have living-wage laws.
</P>
<P>
   Business interests, while not opposing such a law in San
Francisco, want the measure to exempt small companies and
entry-level jobs. They also hope the pay rate doesn't go so high
that it makes doing business with the city unprofitable.
California's minimum wage is $5.75 per hour; the national minimum
is $5.15 per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Nonprofit social service agencies want their contracts with the
city increased to cover any higher wages they might be required to
pay under the living-wage minimum.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, nonprofit agencies formed a political
alliance with corporate San Francisco to fight other regulatory
measures at City Hall _ including labor-backed bids for new job
protection for laid-off janitors and restaurant workers and for
easing union organizing drives.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who has enjoyed the support of labor throughout his
political career, could nonetheless prove to be an obstacle in the
minimum wage push.
</P>
<P>
   Labor got a taste of Brown's resistance to part of its agenda at
the June 1 meeting in his office.
</P>
<P>
   When the unions talked about extending the living wage to
general assistance recipients in the city's workfare program, the
mayor let his labor friends know he thought they were going too
far.
</P>
<P>
   Josie Mooney, of Service Employees International Union Local
790, acknowledged her differences with Brown on the point, but said
it would be hypocritical for the city to impose a living wage on
the private sector while exempting workfare participants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard (for the city) to hold people to a standard it
doesn't hold itself to,'' Mooney said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Mosher of the Committee on Jobs, an association of San
Francisco's biggest corporations, said Brown should be able to help
business, labor and social service groups reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the business community and nonprofit community would
be very amenable to try to build some kind of consensus around a
living-wage issue,'' Mosher said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd rather come up with a solution that lifts people out of
poverty without destroying entry-level jobs and harming nonprofit
service delivery,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mosher said the mayor's first step was helping persuade both
sides to drop, for now, measures aimed at the November ballot.

 &HT;    U.S. THREATENED BY DELAYS ABROAD ON 'MILLENNIUM BUG'
 &HT;    620&AMP;add. With COMPUTERS-DATA
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories for
release Saturday, June 27.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIRFAX, Va. _ American prosperity could be eroded by slow
progress in many other countries toward updating millions of
computer systems and billions of microchips to recognize the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   The damage ``would be about the same size as the expected
economic damage from the turmoil in East Asia,'' Maria Livanos
Gattaui, secretary general of the International Chamber of
Commerce, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do we inject a sense of urgency without generating
doomsday hysteria?'' she asked some 1,700 senior high-tech and
government leaders at the World Congress on Information Technology
here.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates from 93 countries spent hours comparing notes on
the political and technical changes needed to fix or replace
millions of pre-1997 computers and software programs and billions
of embedded chips in electronic devices that won't know whether the
two-digit date ``00'' stands for 1900 or 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Irrespective of whether it is a problem of $1 billion or $1
trillion, it is a problem that is going to affect every country,''
said Ahmad Kamal, a Pakistani diplomat who heads the United Nations
working group on information technology. ``Due to the mere
existence of information-technology networks, no country is in an
isolated pocket that can be hermetically sealed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, government and corporate decision-makers
began focusing seriously on the problem in 1995. Prosperous
European and Asian countries followed up within the next two years.
A survey this year of governments in 158 of the world's poorest
countries showed that more than half had done nothing _ mistakenly
thinking of the so-called Y2K bug was a ``rich nations' problem''
that wouldn't affect their phones, power grids, shipping or fuel
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of late right now for many of us,'' acknowledged
diplomat Carl Frances of Trinidad and Tobago. ``The World Bank is
using British grants to sponsor 20 meetings, including one in
Jamaica for Caribbean countries within a few weeks, to see a
presentation an Italian firm has developed on what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In China, we do not have today the manpower with the precise
skills needed to do this work, `` said Junjie Li, a professor
working for a joint state-private software firm in Qingdao.
Imported software riddled with Year 2000 bugs is used to run
Chinese computers that handle everything from airports and military
missiles to the payrolls at government-owned factories.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are outsourcing to Americans for the fixes,'' Junjie said.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's government recently decided to give tax credits to
businesses that make deadlines and punish government officials who
miss them, said Kuo Yun, the former general who heads Taiwan's
official Year 2000 efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some American firms are subcontracting Year 2000 work
to India, where lower wages and longer hours cut the cost by
three-fourths.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are running three shifts a day right now, doing a lot of
work right from Calcutta for customers in the United States,'' said
Tapan Mukerji, director of a systems integration firm. ``Of course,
we have our own Year 2000 problems, though not as intense or
extensive as in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't put it in the category of 'we're satisfied and we
don't worry about it,' or, you know, 'we're hysterical and our hair
is on fire.' It's somewhere in the middle,'' said Michael Dell,
chairman and chief executive officer of Dell Computer Corp. His
Texas-based company depends on the Internet, phone calls, faxes and
trips to coordinate operations in 42 countries.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Small firms, exporters and importers will bear the brunt of the
risks, predicted David J. Cassano, general manager of Year 2000
global initiatives for IBM Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many small companies are still holding out hope that someone
will come up with the one tool, the silver bullet, that they can
install on a Friday and be okay on a Monday. It isn't going to
happen,'' Cassano said. He said IBM polls of its own customers
suggest that three-fourths of them ``either haven't gotten started
or are in denial.''
</P>
<P>
   Even among large companies, ``globally, many of them are still
in the assessment phase _ sorting out what really has to get
fixed,'' Cassano said.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts in Europe are handicapped by the diversion of many
programmers to work on converting financial systems for next year's
switch from marks, francs and other currencies to the new euro.
</P>
<P>
   Asia's economic turmoil has drained corporate and government
budgets that could have been diverted to Year 2000 fixes, as well.
</P>
<P>
   In many African and Latin American countries, private and public
leaders alike were concentrating on switching from
government-commanded economies to free-market systems, and did not
pay much attention to warnings from their technical staffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some executives tell me 'I'm working on it,' and they just
mean they're still deciding which outside vendor they will try to
hire to perform a miracle,'' said Fernando Parra, president of DTS
Software Latin America, which works on Year 2000 fixes for clients
in many countries.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Parra said, ``Here in Brazil and in
most of Latin America the worst problem is huge governmental firms
_ telephone companies and banks and electrical companies _ that
move so slowly because they need to ask for public bids, and need
budgeting in advance.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``If a telephone company in Peru or in Brazil stops
working, or if an insurance company or bank shuts down for a few
days or a few weeks or whatever, it is a problem for everyone in
every country that is doing business with them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Face it, everybody's behind schedule everywhere, and not all
the work will be done,'' said Barry Ingram, a vice president for
Texas-based Electronic Data Systems Inc., which does systems work
in most countries of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people have to do is assess all their systems, designate
the mission-critical ones that they must repair or replace, and
find ways to live with the errors in the rest of them,'' Ingram
said.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting problems should be kept in perspective, said
Cassano of IBM. ``If an ATM won't give you money, it doesn't mean
your money is not safe. It means the ATM is broken,'' Cassano said.

 (f and a coding)  
 NEW YORK: ... owner Shange.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shange said recently that, now as then, he believes ``people
have the right to protest when there is an injustice towards
them.'' When he protested Harari's move, angry picketers appeared
in front of Freddy's.
</P>
<P>
   Then on a cold day in December, Roland J. Smith Jr., a one-time
vendor, picketer, and self-described black revolutionary, took
matters into his own hands. He entered Freddy's with a .38-caliber
handgun, wounded four people, set a fire in which seven perished,
and shot himself in the chest. The memory of the massacre still
haunts 125th Street. In a similar episode two months ago, a black
man threatened to firebomb a white-owned store across the street.
When police caught up with him, they discovered his duffel bag
contained an AK-47 assault rifle, seven banana clips, a .22-caliber
pistol, a two-way radio, and a ski mask.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One pattern that often emerges after violent outbursts like the
Freddy's attack is that the government pumps money into programs to
revitalize poor communities. A second is that the programs almost
invariably fail. To almost everyone's amazement, that hasn't
happened here _ at least so far.
</P>
<P>
   On its face, the current revitalization effort looks a lot like
previous ones, a government program that promises to use public
dollars to lure private business, but often wind up spending its
money on ancillary things like housing, social services, and
politically connected projects.
</P>
<P>
   However, there are two differences here. First, officials are
actually spending the bulk of their funds on businesses like the
new mall. Second, they are beginning to argue what until recently
would have been heretical in Harlem: that what the community really
needs to do is get ready to compete in the mainstream capitalist
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard for African Americans to wholly embrace capitalism
because we started out in the system as slaves, but the truth is
it's the only thing you can count on,'' said Wright, the
empowerment zone president. ``We've tried the legal system and
we've tried the political system, and that's gotten us part of the
way. But we've got a very, very long way to go,'' she said. ``I
don't see that we have much of an option but to make our peace with
capitalism.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Wright and her colleagues can offer the community a
considerable cushion against the rigors of capitalist competition _
almost $550 million in publicly funded grants, low-interest loans,
and tax breaks over the next 10 years. But their call for Harlem to
get over its problem with free markets is more than rhetoric; to
the shock of some local business people, they have begun enforcing
some rudimentary standards of the mainstream economy.
</P>
<P>
   When Dorothy Pitman Hughes, a politically connected community
activist and owner of Harlem Office Supply, applied for a loan two
years ago, she was rejected. ``Debbie Wright told me the
reason...is I'm not a good businesswoman,'' Hughes said. Hughes
admitted owing $23,000 in back taxes.
</P>
<P>
   How empowerment zone officials have managed to take such action
when it is so at odds with what most of Harlem was saying and doing
about its problems only a few years ago is hard to explain. More
than anything else, it appears to be that residents believe the
officials' promise to land something big for the community. And the
first and crucial ``something'' is Harlem USA, a $65 million
glass-walled mall that will house a nine-screen Loews theater, an
Old Navy clothing store, a Modell's sporting goods store, an New
York Sports Club gym, and a Disney store, as well as an HMV
Records.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of the mall, together with a Pathmark supermarket
going up nearby, is almost impossible to overstate, according to
local leaders. Upper Manhattan (which includes the Harlem, East
Harlem, Washington Heights, and Inwood sections) has 520,000
residents, or only slightly fewer than Boston. But is has only one
movie house, and no full-sized supermarkets, upscale clothing
stores, or chain record stores.
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody is thrilled with the progress. People like Hughes
see a dark purpose in the empowerment zone's strategy. ``They are
trying to move the mass of black people out of Harlem as part of
gentrification,'' asserted the office supply store owner. Hispanic
store owners almost succeeded in killing the Pathmark supermarket
because Abyssinian Development was involved in the project and
Abyssinian is black.
</P>
<P>
   Still with the coming of the mall, something fundamental is
changing in Harlem and nobody knows it better than record store
owner Shange. After complaining recently about the project's
failure to respect ``the essence of the community'' and its
``onslaught against community-based businesses'' such as his, he
abruptly switched gears.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a different ballgame,'' he said of the mall and the HMV
record store. ``It's just another business competing with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Shange is willing to go head-to-head with HMV, but he said needs
something in order to do it. ``Working capital.''
Two-hundred-thousand dollars of it. And he wants it from the
empowerment zone.
</P>
<P>
   Told of the figure, Wright remarked, ``That's an awful lot of
working capital for a little record store.'' Perhaps, but this is
the question that has got to be in the back of her mind: Is it an
awful lot for racial calm?

<P>
   FAIRFAX, Va. _ American prosperity could be eroded by slow
progress in many other countries toward updating millions of
computer systems and billions of microchips to recognize the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   The damage ``would be about the same size as the expected
economic damage from the turmoil in East Asia,'' Maria Livanos
Gattaui, secretary general of the International Chamber of
Commerce, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do we inject a sense of urgency without generating
doomsday hysteria?'' she asked some 1,700 senior high-tech and
government leaders at the World Congress on Information Technology
here.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates from 93 countries spent hours comparing notes on
the political and technical changes needed to fix or replace
millions of pre-1997 computers and software programs and billions
of embedded chips in electronic devices that won't know whether the
two-digit date ``00'' stands for 1900 or 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Irrespective of whether it is a problem of $1 billion or $1
trillion, it is a problem that is going to affect every country,''
said Ahmad Kamal, a Pakistani diplomat who heads the United Nations
working group on information technology. ``Due to the mere
existence of information-technology networks, no country is in an
isolated pocket that can be hermetically sealed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, government and corporate decision-makers
began focusing seriously on the problem in 1995. Prosperous
European and Asian countries followed up within the next two years.
A survey this year of governments in 158 of the world's poorest
countries showed that more than half had done nothing _ mistakenly
thinking of the so-called Y2K bug was a ``rich nations' problem''
that wouldn't affect their phones, power grids, shipping or fuel
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of late right now for many of us,'' acknowledged
diplomat Carl Frances of Trinidad and Tobago. ``The World Bank is
using British grants to sponsor 20 meetings, including one in
Jamaica for Caribbean countries within a few weeks, to see a
presentation an Italian firm has developed on what to do.''

IN HARLEM A CRUCIAL TEST FOR PRIVATE ENTERPRISE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS  
 (f and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER G. GOSSELIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The last time Sikhulu Shange, proprietor of the
Record Shack on Harlem's 125th Street, felt threatened by
development, he blamed it on Racism. This time, he blames it on
Capitalism. In the strange alchemy of urban revitalization, that's
progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are lambs to the slaughter,'' 57-year-old Shange declared
recently. ``We are being driven from existence,'' he said of his
tiny shop, which was at the center of a violent outburst three
years ago when the white store owner from whom he sublet space
tried to evict him in order to expand.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of Shange's new worry is a 265,000-square-foot mall
scheduled to begin rising this summer in the heart of this poor
black community, the first substantial commercial project here in
more than 70 years. It will house an HMV record store that Shange
fears will entice away his customers and a host of other upscale
retailers that have never done business before in a place like
Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   The mall is emerging as a giant test of America's renewed faith
in free markets, and especially of its conviction that private
forces, egged on by substantial tax breaks and low-interest loans,
can reverse the kind of urban blight that a generation of public
programs and billions of dollars of taxpayer money have not.
</P>
<P>
   It is a test as well of a new generation of black leaders who
are often more educated, more affluent, and more at ease with the
business ethos of the era than their predecessors, and one that is
surprisingly, almost shockingly, casual about gestures and
alliances that have largely defined race relations in America since
the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have three, perhaps five, years to prove this thing can
succeed, no more,'' said Deborah C. Wright, the three-time Harvard
graduate (Harvard College, Harvard Law, Harvard Business School)
and president of the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, the agency
responsible for using hundreds of millions of dollars in public
funds to encourage private revitalization of Harlem. ``We can't
give money to people who can't put together a business plan or make
a financial target, no matter how deserving or who they know.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the people almost certain to be looking for money is
Shange. One of the most politically charged decisions Wright is
likely to make is on how to handle his request.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To watch television, where six of the top 10 network shows are
now set in cities, you'd think that urban America is back. To
listen to some business and government leaders, you'd think that
poor urban America is well on its way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inner cities offer market opportunities that are greater than
most countries' and that is beginning to be recognized,'' said
Harvard Business professor Michael E. Porter, who has made himself
a spokesman for private sector revitalization of urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   But inner-city opportunities have yet to produce many results.
Whether they can will be most prominently decided in Harlem _
arguably the nation's best-known inner city, the emotional home
base to millions of African Americans, and a place where the forces
of decline and revival are squared off as almost nowhere else.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most heavily patrolled sections of New York, it has a
murder rate that is still twice the citywide average. Only a
10-minute subway ride from the corporate headquarters of Midtown,
it has an unemployment rate that is four times the national
average. Some streets are lined with elegant brownstones, but
almost one third of its buildings are abandoned. Some affluent
families have begun to return, but more than one third of its
households remain on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   To tackle these problems, ``We're trying to build businesses and
create jobs, not expand social service bureaucracies and erect
monuments to government,'' said New York's Republican governor,
George E. Pataki, whose administration provides Wright's agency
with one third of its funding. ``If our approach can succeed in
Harlem, then there is absolutely no reason it can't succeed
elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One measure of the odds against it succeeding can be found in
the story of what happened at the Record Shack three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The current revitalization effort did not begin with Congress's
1993 passage of empowerment zone legislation, but with a series of
skirmishes between street vendors and police along 125th Street
that ended in murder and arson. City officials insisted then that
they were simply trying to maintain order, but some Harlem
residents saw the plight of the black vendors as part of a larger
struggle to free Harlem from what they believed to be its mostly
white store owners.
</P>
<P>
   The battle lines hardened in late 1995 when the white owner of
Freddy's Fashion Mart on 125th Street, Fred A. Harari, told one of
the few black store owners that he could no longer sublet space.
The black owner was Record Shack owner Shange.

IN 1977, SHE WAS ONE OF THE BOYS

<P>
   Twenty-one years ago,  &UR; Leslie Greis  &LR; was playing golf with the
guys at Harvard. Not necessarily because she wanted to _ Harvard
didn't have a women's team.
</P>
<P>
   Flash forward to last week. Greis was rubbing elbows with
professional golfers at the US Open in San Francisco, and  &UR; Arnold
Palmer  &LR; presented her with an Achievement Award from the College
Golf Foundation and Rolex at a dinner hosted by Palmer and  &UR; Jim
Nantz. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Greis, who grew up in Holden, Mass., recalls that when she
entered Harvard in 1977, ``it came on the heels of Title IX,
(enacted in 1975) so absent a women's team, I was welcomed onto the
men's team.'' She went on to earn three varsity letters before
graduating with a degree in economics in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Greis, 39, said that being a minority on the team didn't strike
her as especially unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had done the same thing at Wachusett Regional High School,
so playing with guys was not anything different,'' she said. She
admits the caliber of play was different, though. ``It was at the
college level, and we played at The Country Club.''
</P>
<P>
   While none of her teammates treated her differently, Greis
acknowledged that competitors often did a double take. ``I'm sure a
couple of heads turned,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Since a women's team was not formed at Harvard until 12 years
after she entered, Greis was allowed to enter women's tournaments,
and in 1979 was named Massachusetts Women's Intercollegiate Golf
Champion. She also played on the Harvard women's basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation, Greis wanted to stay on the golf circuit, and
tourned nationally in pursuit of her LPGA card. She even attended
the LPGA qualifying school three times, but to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally hung up my spikes and decided to put my economics
degree to use,'' Greis said.
</P>
<P>
   She currently works for Cambridge Associates, advising nonprofit
institutions in investment issues, and was previously a senior
executive vice president at the Peoples Bancorp of Worcester.
</P>
<P>
   On the volunteer side, Greis has been a director of the YWCA of
Central Massachusetts and is a former director of the Harvard
Alumni Association. And she still supports the Harvard teams by
``writing checks, and showing up to cheer them on.''
</P>
<P>
   At the award ceremony last week in San Francisco, Greis was
honored along with former vice president  &UR; Dan Quayle &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who was
captain of the golf team and top player his senior year at DePauw
University.
</P>
<P>
   Each received a Rolex watch, and their alma mater's golf
programs each received a $2,500 donation. Greis noted that both the
men's and women's golf teams at Harvard will benefit from the
award.
</P>

Climbing for charity

<P>

</P>
<P>
   The 80 women who spent the weekend climbing the White Mountains
to benefit the Elizabeth Stone House are no doubt soaking their
feet now.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Beth Shapiro &LR; , founder of the four-year-old Wilderness Heals
hike, declared it a success, and said that the Stone House in
Jamaica Plain should reach its goal of $130,000. The Stone House
offers services for women ranging from protection from domestic
violence to skill training to get women back in the workforce.
</P>
<P>
   She reported that the ropes given each team for emergency stream
crossings weren't necessary, but rain ponchos were.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you I've never seen lightning from up close before
_ it's amazing,'' Shapiro said.

HARLEM AGENCY`S PRESIDENT STRIKES RIGHT BALANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER G. GOSSELIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For a teenage Deborah C. Wright, growing up the
eldest daughter of a black Baptist minister in the South meant a
life full of givens. Chief among them: attending Atlanta's Spelman
College, the proper school for generations of middle-class
African-American women.
</P>
<P>
   But Wright would have none of it; she would go to Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew my dad was upset when he offered me a car if I wouldn't
go north,'' laughed Wright, now 40 and president of the Upper
Manhattan Empowerment Zone, the agency charged with doling out $550
million in public funds to help jump-start Harlem's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Wright has made a specialty of such cautious, finessed
rebellions, ones that shake up those close to her, but that let her
reach from one world into another. It is a talent that could serve
her well as she tries to bridge the gap between high finance and
grinding poverty, between &UR;  &LR; a white elite and a black underclass, to
help lift up Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   When it was time for Wright to pick a career, her family assumed
she would follow her famous aunt, social activist and FOH (Friend
of Hillary) Marion Wright Edelman, and go to law school. But to
their dismay, she discovered that her real passion was business.
(She compromised by earning advanced degrees in both law and
business, both at Harvard.)
</P>
<P>
   When it was time to go to work, she landed one of the hottest
jobs at the hottest firms of the 1980s: corporate finance at First
Boston Inc. But she threw it over for a modest marketing position
with a nonprofit housing agency.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, with her job as politically and racially sensitive
as any in this notoriously sensitive city, she continues to buck
the expected. After finishing work in poor black Harlem, she takes
what for almost anybody else would be a politically suicidal step:
She goes home to predominantly white and trendy Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the pattern, friends and colleagues seemed offended,
insisting it reflects no uncertainty or conflict in Wright. But
Wright herself had a different reaction. ``There's no question,''
she said. ``There's a duality.'' And to all appearances, it has
been there from the outset.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Wright is the product of two very different
worlds: a child of rural and static Bennettsville, S.C., who came
of age in the upheaval of the civil right movement; and a daughter
of the town's leading black pastor who is also the niece of one of
America's fiercest liberal advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the friction between those worlds is still apparent
today in what her father and aunt have to say about Wright's early
life and their roles.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Harry S. Wright, who is now minister of the Cornerstone
Baptist Church in Crown Heights, said his daughter was a ``very
determined and impatient'' young person for whom he sought to
provide ``a stable presence'' and ``some sense of sanity.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Edelman, founder and president of the Children's
Defense Fund, one of the nation's most forceful advocacy groups,
described her niece as someone with ``great grit'' who ``challenged
the segregated mores of the town far more than her parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright's challenges have traced the arc of a generation of
African Americans from activism to protest to separation and back.
Her class was the first to attend Bennettsville's formerly
all-white elementary school. When her sixth-grade principal refused
to lower the flag after the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s
assassination, she led a walkout. By the time she'd finished
Radcliffe, she had retreated into a black enclave. She remembers
her mother remarking at graduation that she had not introduced any
white friends, and Wright responding, ``I don't have any.''
</P>
<P>
   Her return to the mainstream was too abrupt. Not long after
leaving Harvard, she found herself a $135,000-a-year investment
banker and deeply unhappy. ``She told me she'd spent eight years
preparing for a professional life that she didn't want,'' said
Kathyrn S. Wylde, who was running a nonprofit housing agency at the
time and is now chief executive of the New York City Investment
Fund. ``She was profoundly shaken by that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wright recovered her footing, first in a $35,000-a-year job
with Wlyde's group; then in a series of high-profile positions for
both Democratic Mayor David Dinkins and his Republican successor
Rudolph Giuliani; and now as empowerment zone president.
</P>
<P>
   Even critics say she is maintaining a near-perfect mix of
combativeness and conciliation in her current job, a vital
ingredient for someone with millions of dollars to give away, but a
wild array of political factions to appease.
</P>
<P>
   Wright herself traces the ability to her long search or the
proper balance between the minister and the advocate in her
life.``I feel like I spend 80 percent of my time trying to find the
middle ground on the spectrum from Dad to Marion,'' she said.

GAY PRIDE EVENTS MEAN BIG BUSINESS IN SAN FRANCISCO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL DOUGAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Two years ago a young man from London joined the
throngs of eager tourists who flock each year to San Francisco's
annual gay pride parade. Like most, he was electrified by the scene
played out before him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the most enobling moments in my life,'' he
recalled this week. ``You get a sense of the tremendous power of
the queer community in the Bay area.''
</P>
<P>
   He was particularly impressed by the participation of prominent
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming from outside the Bay area,'' he said, ``it is quite
awesome to see that level of support.''
</P>
<P>
   The eager Briton _ Teddy Witherington _ is now executive
director of the San Francisco Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and
Transgender Parade taking place Sunday. As the parade's first paid
honcho, he found himself wondering how many others venture into San
Francisco from distant locales to attend the world-famous
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Ask those in the know and the answer is: Lots. Many. Mobs of
'em. Which is to say that those in the know don't know.
</P>
<P>
   They fill the hotels. They ring up pre-Christmas levels of sales
at restaurants and trinket emporiums. But data _ how many come and
how much they spend _ have never been gathered, Witherington
admitted Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until now there's been this acceptance that, yes, all these
people come and, yes, it's a great economic engine for the city,
but nobody how many or whether they're coming from Arkansas or
Nevada or Washington State,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, parade organizers will have a visitor's
center at the event this year and _ more importantly _ a team of 30
researchers will comb the crowd ``to give us a start, at least'' in
obtaining data about visitors, Witherington said.
</P>
<P>
   For businesses, the figures will confirm what they already know
_ oodles of out-of-towners spend gobs of money on the day before
the parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it Pink Saturday,'' said Irv Spivak, past president of
the Golden Gate Business Association, a gay business organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditionally, this is like our Christmas and likewise go the
sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Spivak said some businesses report that the Saturday before the
parade is their highest grossing day of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who really benefits from it are the gift shops, the
restaurants, the hotels and the bed and breakfasts,'' said Steven
Perlmutter of The Lavender Pages, a gay business directory. ``A lot
of these people do really well.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime hotel rooms become scarce during the gay pride weekend,
said John Neal of Travel Trends, a San Francisco travel agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europeans stop in and say `Where are we going to stay?''' he
said. ``There are still rooms in the city, out by Fisherman's
Wharf, out in the suburbs. That's not what they want, but if they
come unprepared, that's what they end up with.''

LEONARD-MOVIE (Los Angeles) _ Call him Dutch. That's what
novelist/screenwriter Elmore Leonard's friends do. Now call him
successful. That's because Quentin Tarantino, Danny De Vito and the
rest of Hollywood finally have figured out how to capture Leonard's
effortless realism, offbeat characters and ear for offbeat dialogue
on celluloid. By Glenn Whipp. 
. 
TRUMAN-FILM (Los Angeles) _ In a clear case of life imitating art,
all eyes were on ``The Truman Show'' at the recent San Diego
International Film Festival, where it dominated the awards for
studio entries. By Bob McCarthy. 
. 
SIGHT-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ ``Out of Sight'' continues the recent
string of successful Elmore Leonard big-screen adaptations that
began with ``Get Shorty'' and leading-man George Clooney finally
delivers the goods. 3{ Stars. By Glenn Whipp. 
. 
DOLITTLE-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ With its computer-generated effects
that bring the animals and their verbal skills to life, ``Dr.
Dolittle'' undoubtedly will will appeal mostly to the ``Babe''
crowd: kids and soft-hearted animal lovers. 2{ Stars. By Glenn
Whipp. 
. 
TANGO-STAGE (Los Angeles) _ Luis Bravo knows there are many other
tango shows out there. Too many? ``To be honest, I didn't see the
other ones,'' replies the ever-diplomatic musician and impresario.
As for judging the relative merits of these fast-spawning tango
tributes, Bravo demurs, ``I leave that for the people.'' By Reed
Johnson. 
. 
SYSTEM-MUSIC (Los Angeles) _ Bet you've never heard of an Armenian
hard rock band before. But the Valley-based System of a Down _ the
strange name comes from the title of a poem written by the band's
guitarist _ built up such a buzz on the local club scene that major
labels launched a bidding war. By Fred Shuster. 
. 
POP-BEAT (Los Angeles) _ On its first album four years ago, the
funky North Carolina band Dag proved it could lay down deep soul
grooves in an age of synthetic effects. With ``Apartment 635'' due
Tuesday, Dag is still doing things the old-fashioned way. By Fred
Shuster. 
. 
DISCS-MUSIC (Los Angeles) _ Top local club band Ozomatli is a
melting pot all by itself. The 11-member group's politicized fusion
of salsa, jazz, rap and funk is bolstered by a solid rhythm section
that often makes up for a lack of outstanding material on its
self-titled debut from the Almo Sounds label. By Fred Shuster. 
. 
MORI-ART (Los Angeles) _ She could be the star of a '50s sci-fi
serial, or perhaps a high priestess of some exotic,
technology-based religion. In fact, Japanese artist Mariko Mori
sees technology not as art's implacable foe, but as an ally in an
ongoing quest for spiritual equilibrium. By Reed Johnson.

LEONARD UNLOCKED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After federal marshal Karen Sisco stumbles onto a
South Florida prison break in an early scene from the new
underworld comedy ``Out of Sight,'' she soon finds herself locked
in the trunk of the getaway car with one of the escaped convicts, a
debonair bank robber named Jack Foley.
</P>
<P>
   It's close quarters for Jack and Karen, and since they're played
by George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez, you know some sparks are
going to fly. And they do _ sort of _ but mostly the two talk about
the movies, old films like ``Three Days of the Condor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Karen says, ``the one with Faye Dunaway and Robert
Redford, when he was young.''
</P>
<P>
   Novelist Elmore Leonard, who wrote the book upon which ``Out of
Sight'' is based, finds it perfectly natural that a federal marshal
and career criminal would find a common language in film.
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk about the movies; I know I do with my friends,''
Leonard says. ``Movies are something we all know. One of the
quickest ways to get to know a stranger is to ask him what movies
he likes. It's that simple.'' &QL; 
These days, the type of movies Hollywood producers seem to like are
ones based on Elmore Leonard novels. When Leonard began writing, he
supported his westerns and crime capers by cranking out
screenplays. Among them were two original works that Leonard
himself calls stinkers _ a Charles Bronson revenge picture, ``Mr.
Majestyk'' and probably the worst western Clint Eastwood ever made,
``Joe Kidd.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad thing about screenplays is that you have to please
everyone involved with the movie, and that's too many people,''
Leonard, 72, says. ``I always took (Raymond) &UR;  &LR; Chandler's advice on
working in Hollywood, which was to wear your second-best suit,
artistically speaking, and keep your mouth shut. That's why I
always stayed with the books first. There, the only person I have
to please is myself.''
</P>
<P>
   After his novels became financially successful _ no short
process _ Leonard let others adapt his work for the screen. But the
resulting movies _ duds like ``Stick,'' ``52 Pick-up'' and ``Cat
Chaser'' _ always failed because they never grasped the funky,
funny world of misfit losers that Leonard always so perfectly
captured on the page.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought he deserved better movies,'' says Clooney, a
big fan, who still can recall every word of his first conversation
with Leonard. (``He's this little guy and he walks up and says,
`Hi. Call me Dutch.' And I'm like, `OK, Mr. Leonard. You got it.'')
</P>
<P>
   Leonard's books have been getting better treatment recently,
starting three years ago when screenwriter Scott Frank nailed
Leonard's snappy tone with ``Get Shorty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When we did that movie, it was the hardest of hard sells,''
says Danny DeVito, whose company, Jersey Films, produced both ``Get
Shorty'' and ``Out of Sight.'' ``Nobody wanted to do an Elmore
Leonard book.''
</P>
<P>
   And now everyone does. Last year, Quentin Tarantino paid homage
to the author, putting the wild eccentrics of ``Rum Punch'' into
his ``Pulp Fiction'' follow-up, ``Jackie Brown.'' In fact,
Tarantino loves Leonard's work so much that his production company
bought the rights to four other novels, including one of his early
westerns.
</P>
<P>
   Joel and Ethan Coen have already written the screenplay for
Leonard's latest book, Cuba Libre, a period piece set in Cuba
around the time of the Spanish-American War, and are considering
bringing it to the screen as their next project. ABC is looking to
turn Maximum Bob, one of Leonard's most popular novels, into a
television series. And Leonard has already written _ and sold _ his
``Get Shorty'' sequel, Be Cool, which follows loan shark Chili
Palmer into the music business. John Travolta is reportedly very
interested in reprising the role.
</P>
<P>
   Tarantino, who says he shoplifted Leonard's novel The Switch
from a local K-mart when he was 15, believes it was just a matter
of time before the novelist made it big in the movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most important things about Elmore's work is that
feeling of effortless realism,'' Tarantino says, ``where events
seem to just sort of unfold all by themselves and you're reading
along and you say to yourself, `This is exactly the way it would
really happen.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Screenwriter &UR;  &LR; Frank, who did another fine job putting Leonard's
world on the screen with ``Out of Sight,'' agrees, saying that he
never knows what's going to happen next even as he's reading.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all happenstance, and that's what makes the books so
delicious,'' Frank says. ``Elmore himself will tell you he doesn't
know what's going to happen when he sits down to write every day.
The books feel like that in a wonderful way, and I think that's one
of the things that help turn them into really enjoyable movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank says the key to adapting Leonard's work to the screen is
to give it structure while maintaining that sense of
unpredictability. Certainly, the early Leonard-based films failed
simply by adhering too closely to cinematic devices without
managing to capture the author's comedic tone and knack for ironic,
offbeat characters and distinctive dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those movies took themselves way too seriously,'' Leonard
says. ``These last few films _ ``Get Shorty,'' ``Jackie Brown'' and
this one _ put the emphasis on character and not the action. You
find out what these people are like and how they talk. Then stuff
happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognize the books in these movies,'' Leonard continues.
``Not that I need to. I just want a good movie. I don't care how
closely they're adapted.''
</P>
<P>
   With ``Out of Sight,'' Leonard was initially surprised that
Clooney was cast as Jack Foley, a career criminal in his 50s in the
book. In his mind, Foley was closer to Jack Nicholson or Sean
Connery.
</P>
<P>
   ``George works, though, because he has an ageless quality to
him,'' Frank says. ``And with a younger guy playing the part, one
of the book's most interesting themes _ the road not taken _ is
given a little different twist. Here's this guy, getting older, and
he meets a wonderful woman and wonders, `What if I hadn't been a
bank robber? Maybe I could have actually had a relationship with
this woman instead of 10 minutes in a motel.' George gives it the
same kind of sadness that would have been there with Connery.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Leonard doesn't spend a whole lot of time in
self-analysis. He says most of his lead characters are pretty much
like himself _ flawed men who drift through life waiting to see
what the next day brings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is one difference, though,'' Leonard says, smiling. ``I
love the idea of coming up with exactly the right line. I can do it
in my books, but never in my life.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, I'm skiing in Aspen and it's 4:30 and I'm sitting
on a bench exhausted and a woman puts her foot up on the bench to
unsnap her boots and says, `God, I don't know what is more
satisfying. To take off your boots or to get laid.' And, of course,
I said, `Uuuuuh.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I've wondered for years what one of my guys would have said.
And I'm still wondering.''
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Leonard no longer skis.

`OUT OF SIGHT' OFFERS CLEAR PICTURE OF CHARACTER-BASED
ACTION-COMEDY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 3{ Stars 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If you combined the budgets of Steven Soderbergh's
first six films (which include ``sex, lies, and videotape,'' the
movie that put the Sundance Film Festival on the map in 1989), you
wouldn't come close to the $50 million he spent on his latest
picture, the sleazy action comedy ``Out of Sight.''
</P>
<P>
   Soderbergh, though, proves he can handle a big budget (OK, it's
pretty puny by summer movie standards) and deliver the goods,
producing a funny, crackling caper movie that continues the recent
string of successful Elmore Leonard big-screen adaptations that
began with ``Get Shorty'' and continued last year with Quentin
Tarantino's ``Jackie Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   A key element here is the presence of screenwriter Scott Frank,
who proved he had a way with Leonard when he helped bring ``Get
Shorty'' to the screen three years ago. Like that movie, ``Out of
Sight'' isn't so much about action as it is about characters, in
this case a group of sharply drawn bank robbers, thugs and lowlifes
who manage somehow to be endearing, even though most of them are
pretty frightening human beings. Frank understands that, perfectly
nailing Leonard's comic tone while streamlining his book's plot to
make it work as a film.
</P>
<P>
   George Clooney stars as Jack Foley, a mostly successful bank
robber whose failure to plan ahead on one job lands him in prison.
There he engineers a prison break (one of the movie's best
sequences) that falls a little short of expectations, landing Foley
in the trunk of the getaway car with a curvy federal marshal, Karen
Sisco (Jennifer Lopez), who inadvertently happened on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   During the ensuing road trip, Jack's hand rests softly on
Karen's leg while they talk about movies and life's missed
opportunities. When they part, they can't stop thinking about each
other. And the audience can't wait to see them together again.
</P>
<P>
   The chemistry between Clooney and Lopez works so well that the
filmmakers have added a couple of scenes to the film just to put
these two sexy performers together again. Their encounters
underscore the movie's running theme, the Big ``What If?'' as Jack
wistfully wonders what his life _ and his relationship with Karen _
might have been like if he had chosen a path that didn't include
holdup notes and getaways.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is filled with first-rate performances, including Ving
Rhames as Jack's conscientious bank-robbing buddy, Steve Zahn
playing a perpetually stoned accomplice who's always seen wearing
cheap sunglasses and Don Cheadle as a rival con man out to beat
Foley at his own game.
</P>
<P>
   Soderbergh and Frank refuse to make any judgments about the
characters' behavior, leaving the audience to relish their amoral
behavior and its often funny _ and dire _ consequences. Most
importantly, they find the key to each character. You feel like you
know these people, even if they're only on screen for a few
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   With this movie, Clooney finally has found a vehicle to fulfill
his leading-man promise. Lopez continues to turn heads with her
acting as well as her figure, only this time she is surrounded by
talent that helps her rise to an even higher level.
</P>
<P>
   Soderbergh, too, has stepped up his game (not that his resume
doesn't include some decent movies _ it's just that no one has seen
them). His technique lays the groundwork for much of the
electricity between Clooney and Lopez, from the scene in the trunk
to an absorbing, intimate love scene that memorably cross-cuts
between a hotel lounge where the couple meets and the bedroom where
they wind up.
</P>
<P>
   It's the most arresting moment in the movie, which is saying
something, because ``Out of Sight'' is a film that is loaded with
such moments. Soderbergh should consider making another movie that
people will actually see, certainly before another 10 years
passes. &UR;

`DR. DOLITTLE' TICKLES THE FUNNY BONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 2{ Stars 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Eddie Murphy does, indeed, talk to the animals in
the newly updated version of ``Dr. Dolittle.'' It would be nice,
though, if this frequently funny film would also occasionally speak
to its audience above the level of, say, an 8-year-old. As it
stands, ``Dr. Dolittle'' will appeal mostly to kids and
soft-hearted animal lovers who will enjoy the film's entertaining
and often sympathetic stable of chattering critters.
</P>
<P>
   With its computer-generated effects that bring the animals and
their verbal skills to life, the movie undoubtedly will remind many
of that porcine classic, ``Babe.'' ``Dr. Dolittle'' certainly can
match that movie laugh for laugh, but director Betty Thomas (``The
Brady Bunch Movie,'' ``Private Parts'') is unable to wring any
poignancy from the pedestrian script. What we're left with is cute
animals and sight gags involving pigeon poop.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there's anything wrong with that _ up to a point. This
remake is vastly superior to the 1967 musical, a movie so bad it
almost bankrupted 20th Century Fox. There are no sappy songs here _
just a cute little guinea pig (voiced by Chris Rock) who does a
mean version of Bob Dylan's ``Blowin' in the Wind.'' Murphy's
doctor is much more engaging than Rex Harrison's M.D., although in
fairness to Harrison, he did try to escape the project when he
realized just how bad it was going to be.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Dolittle'' never sinks to that level, mostly because it
never aspires to be anything more than a funny movie for kids.
</P>
<P>
   When we first meet Dolittle, he's a young boy conversing with
the family dog. His father (Ossie Davis) thinks that's a little
odd, particularly after the little Dolittle greets his new school
principal by sniffing his butt. Following that episode, Dad sends
the pooch away and the child comes to believe that he should keep
his unique gift to himself.
</P>
<P>
   Flash forward 30 years and Dolittle is a family man with a wife
and two daughters (who would have thought we'd ever buy Eddie
Murphy as a patriarch?) and a thriving medical practice. Then one
day, he starts hearing those voices again. And they're not inside
his head _ the cacophony of conversation is coming from the family
guinea pig, stray dogs he sees on the street and mice in garbage
cans. He can understand every word and, just as significantly, they
can understand him. Dr. Dolittle soon becomes a magnet for every
creature in need.
</P>
<P>
   The film's premise _ a man who dismisses animals as a nuisance
suddenly can't stop hearing what they have to say _ works well and
creates many funny situations. The animals and computer effects
blend to produce some memorable characters, including a
wisecracking stray terrier and a monkey whose beverage of choice is
Jack Daniel's. The vocal talent is uniformly good, too, including
performances by Norm MacDonald, Albert Brooks, Garry Shandling and
the aforementioned Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the movie never goes beyond its premise. Would-be
heartfelt moments involving a sick circus tiger, a stay by Dolittle
in a mental hospital and some father-daughter bonding all fall
rather flat. And although the movie runs for less than 90 minutes,
its novelty begins to flag after about an hour. It's at this point
that a decent script would have come in handy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in a time where the nation's favorite television
character is a taco-loving Chihuahua, there's bound to be an
audience who just wants to listen to the animals _ even if they
don't have much of anything original to say.

DOWN WITH A HARD-ROCK SYSTEM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Armenian rock _ it may just be the Next Big Thing.
</P>
<P>
   System of a Down _ made up of four young Armenians from the
Valley _ built up such a buzz on the club scene that major labels
launched a bidding war.
</P>
<P>
   In the three years the group has been plying its trade, its
eclectic, aggressive sound has won fans in Europe and the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Lead singer Serg Tankian says it's merely a coincidence that
System of a Down's four members are Armenian, but concedes that the
common bond may have something to do with the music's strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe being Armenian has allowed me to see more clearly
injustice in the world,'' said Tankian, 30, of Sherman Oaks,
referring to his country's troubled history. ``We're in touch with
our heritage and culture, and we're proud of it.''
</P>
<P>
   System of a Down's Rick Rubin-produced self-titled debut on
American/Columbia is due Tuesday. The unusual band name stems from
a poem by the quartet's guitarist Daron Malakian.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meaning is open to interpretation,'' Tankian said. ``It
can mean different things for different people.''
</P>
<P>
   The hard-rock genre has never been famous as pop's United
Nations, but System of a Down _ which blends metal, rap, rock and
even Middle Eastern melodies _ isn't the only ethno-metal outfit.
</P>
<P>
   This week's hard-rock chart features East German band Rammstein
and Brazil's Soulfly with ex-Sepultura singer Max Cavalera.
</P>
<P>
   ``We built up interest on the street by playing clubs when
nobody was interested,'' Tankian explained. ``We entered the scene
from nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   System of a Down, which recently opened a short tour for label
mates Slayer, is currently on the road with Ozzfest, the
hard-rocking summer trek featuring Ozzy Osbourne and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Slayer crowd is very intense,'' Tankian said. ``We got a
tremendous response, taking into consideration that Slayer is the
heaviest band you could ever open for. When we started out with
them, we were wondering what would ever become of us. But whenever
I went into the crowd after a show, kids were coming up and saying
how much they liked us.''
</P>
<P>
   Tankian said the game plan for his band involves lots of steady
touring.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the first day, we never did this knowing we'd get played
on the radio,'' the singer said. ``We don't even have a video
concept or a single figured out yet. Building our roots is what's
important right now. We do what we do and if it hits radio, fine.''
</P>
<P>
   System of a Down's diverse sound (which sometimes includes a
cover of Berlin's angsty '80s radio hit ``The Metro'') comes from
the wide-ranging listening tastes of the band members, Tankian
claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're into goth, jazz, hip-hop, pop, alternative, Armenian
music _ all sorts of things,'' said Tankian, who grew up in
Hollywood. ``In other words, whatever is good. Someone told me
there's no magic in finding good music but you know it when it hits
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Tankian, whose group has played often at such Sunset Strip clubs
as the Viper Room, the Whisky and the Roxy, says there's more
camaraderie than competition among bands on the local scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I see it, the idea of competition is more an invention
as far as I'm concerned,'' he said. ``On the street, everyone's
just trying to do their best and be themselves.''

OZOMATLI A MELTING POT BAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
OZOMATLI/``Ozomatli''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Top local club band Ozomatli is a melting pot all by itself. The
11-member group's politicized fusion of salsa, jazz, rap and funk
is bolstered by a solid rhythm section that often makes up for a
lack of outstanding material on its self-titled debut from the Almo
Sounds label. The energetic album, which in places recalls the
much-missed San Francisco funk 'n' world-beat band the Looters, is
best on the Afro-Cuban grooves and crisp Prince-style dance-funk
tunes like ``Cut Chemist Suite'' and ``Super Bowl Sundae.''
Ozomatli _ the Indian name for the Aztec god of dance _ also pulls
off some adventurous horn arrangements and, in the end, just may
fuel a world-beat revolution. 3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
LUCINDA WILLIAMS/``Car Wheels on a Gravel Road''
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope Mercury uses some of those Hanson bucks on something
that matters. Almost six years in the making, country-folkie
Williams' ``Car Wheels on a Gravel Road'' is an absolute joy and is
shaping up to be the album of the year. The disc offers masterful,
instantly affecting songs such as ``Right in Time,'' ``Drunken
Angel,'' ``Greenville'' and ``Lake Charles,'' jaw-dropping vocal
performances from Williams, who at one point channels a weary
Appalachian mom, and imaginative playing from guitarists Buddy
Miller, Gurf Morlix and Greg Leisz that goes far beyond the realm
of plain old backup work. This album took so long to make, no less
than three producers were involved. ``Car Wheels,'' due Tuesday, is
exceptional. 4 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SOUNDTRACK/``The Truman Show''
</P>
<P>
   The year's best movie comes with a most diverse score. ``The
Truman Show'' (Milan) features original music from German classical
pianist Burkhard Dallwitz, affecting new pieces and other
compositions from avant-garde composer Philip Glass and an
especially haunting theme by Polish composer Wojciech Kilar.
There's also a Chopin piano sonata movement performed by Artur
Rubinstein and a remake of Marc Bolan's ``Twentieth Century Boy''
by British beat combo the Big Six. Like the film, the soundtrack is
solidly entertaining. 3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
THELONIOUS MONK/``Monk Alone: The Complete Columbia Solo Studio
Recordings (1962-68)''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't truly a reissue since 14 of the 37 tracks from the
'60s found on this two-CD set are not so much alternate takes but
new approaches to the tunes. That's Monk for you, especially when
playing unaccompanied. This distinctive and compelling pianist _
perhaps best-known for co-writing the standard ``'Round Midnight''
_ was sometimes considered difficult because of his ear for
dissonance and his rhythmic virtuosity. Here, Monk works his magic
on such standards as ``Body and Soul,'' ``Just a Gigolo,'' ``Don't
Blame Me'' and ``Nice Work If You Can Get It,'' among other titles,
played in slow stride style and without much deviation from the
melody. It may be because Monk was learning some of this material
from sheet music in the studio that some tracks here have a
thinking-out-loud quality to them. 3{ Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
TOM WAITS/``Beautiful Maladies: The Island Years''
</P>
<P>
   This 23-track compilation contains songs chosen by Waits from
his 10 years of work for the Island label. The titles alone tell
the story _ ``Jockey Full of Bourbon,'' ``Earth Died Screaming,''
``Cold Cold Ground,'' ``Frank's Wild Years'' _ along with deeply
weird, intentionally lo-fi and always adventurous music. What makes
this album special is the way Waits' sequencing sheds new light on
his material. 3{ Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
RANCID/``Life Won't Wait''
</P>
<P>
   On its previous album, Bay Area punkers Rancid did a pretty
convincing Clash imitation on such cuts as ``Ruby Soho'' and ``Time
Bomb.'' The new album also follows the Clash, but this time right
off the rails. ``Life Won't Wait'' (Epitaph), due Tuesday, has its
moments to be sure. The title track, the punk anthem ``Bloodclot,''
the ska-infused ``Hooligans,'' ``Hoover Street'' _ all are
standouts. But by the time we get to the halfway point, ``Leicester
Square,'' Rancid are singing in fake British accents and
name-checking South American revolutionary hot spots. 2{ Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
CHUCK RAINEY/``The Chuck Rainey Coalition''
</P>
<P>
   Originally released in the early '70s, this album from studio
mainstay and bass great Rainey offers some choice New York groove
music normally found these days only on old Stuff albums. Rainey,
part of the great Atlantic rhythm section that cut some of Aretha's
golden moments, put together an all-star cast for this effort,
including guitarists Cornell Dupree, Eric Gale and Billy Butler,
drummer Bernard Purdie and keyboardist Richard Tee. Although Rainey
is at his most intuitive when backing vocalists, the
all-instrumental ``Chuck Rainey Coalition'' (DCC) boasts some nice
moments, such as the covers of ``Harlem Nocturne'' and the ``Peter
Gunn'' theme. 2 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
BLUE HAWAIIANS/``Sway''
</P>
<P>
   Popular in local clubs like the Lava Lounge for blending cool
surf sounds and sultry instrumental exotica, the Blue Hawaiians
here treat fans to 11 originals and four covers, including Henry
Mancini's `Charade.'' The quintet's convincing retro
sands-at-sunset sound on ``Sway'' (Pascal) avoids the cynicism of
much of today's newly embalmed lounge stylists while guitarist Mark
Sproull, steel guitarist Gary Brandin and drummer Tom Maxwell earn
marks for authenticity and strong originals like ``Last Days of
Summer.'' 3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
HEATHER NOVA/``Siren''
</P>
<P>
   Two years since the release of her debut album, Nova has logged
many hundreds of road miles and the hard-won self-confidence shows
here. Along with emotive singing, fine lyrical imagery and strong
guitar-driven musicianship, ``Siren'' (Work) has a number of strong
melodies like album-opener ``London Rain'' and especially
``Avalanche.'' 3 Stars.

`TRUMAN SHOW' TAKES TOP PRIZE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB McCARTHY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ All eyes were on ``The Truman Show'' at the recent
San Diego International Film Festival, where it dominated the
awards for studio entries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truman'' was chosen best major studio film, Peter Weir best
director, Ed Harris best actor; it also took the award for best
screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, writer Andrew Niccol's title character, Truman
Burbank, has grown up with the world watching him on television,
only he doesn't know it.
</P>
<P>
   The only major award ``The Truman Show'' didn't win was best
actress, which went to Gwyneth Paltrow for ``A Perfect Murder.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Smoke Signals,'' by director Chris Eyre, was the judges'
choice for best American independent feature. It won other awards
in the independent category: Eyre was chosen best director, Adam
Beach best actor, and Sherman Alexie took the prize for best
screenplay. The film is being distributed by Miramax.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvie Testud was chosen best actress for her performance in
``Beyond Silence,'' also a Miramax release. The French film ``Gadjo
Dilo'' won best foreign film honors.
</P>
<P>
   Audience members voted ``En Garde'' by director Phillipe De
Broca best foreign film and ``The Waiting Game'' by Chris verr Wiel
best American independent feature.
</P>
<P>
   Lifetime achievement awards were presented to actor Martin
Landau, who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for ``Ed Wood,'' and
director John Frankenheimer, whose 1962 political thriller, ``The
Manchurian Candidate,'' starring the late Frank Sinatra, was among
the 80 films screened during the festival's 10-day run.
</P>
<P>
   SPEAKING OF TRUMAN: Missouri's own ``Give-'em-Hell'' Harry
Truman wore many hats in his day: president, senator, farmer,
husband, father and, ironically, haberdasher. After leaving the
White House in 1952, &UR;  &LR; he returned to Independence, Mo., where he
lived to be 88.
</P>
<P>
   This American folk hero's long and eventful life is the subject
of a documentary, ``Harry S. Truman, 1884-1972'' showing 7:30 p.m.
Tuesday at Skirball Cultural Center, 2701 N. Sepulveda Blvd., Los
Angeles. Academy Award-winning director Charles Guggenheim will
introduce his film, commissioned by the Harry S. Truman Library
Institute, at its West Coast premiere.
</P>
<P>
   Momentous world events occurred on Truman's watch as president _
the decision to use atomic weapons against Japan, the Korean War,
the recognition of Israel and the Berlin airlift _ and Guggenheim's
film examines the difficulties Truman faced in deciding what action
the United States should take. The presentation is the last in the
``Vantage Point'' symposium under the ``50 Years of Friendship:
America &AMP; Israel'' exhibitions and programs.
</P>
<P>
   Call (310) 440-4500 for program and ticket information.
</P>
<P>
   COMING OUT: The 16th annual gay and lesbian film showcase,
``Outfest '98,'' opens July 9 with a gala and premiere of ``Relax
... It's Just Sex'' at the historic downtown Orpheum Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   The Sundance Film Festival entry ``Relax,'' follows a tight-knit
group of 30-somethings who begin drifting in different directions.
Sundance program director John Cooper praised it as ``emblematic of
a refreshing trend in independent cinema with gays, lesbians and
straights co-existing together, just like real-life Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 250 films and videos will be shown over the July 9-20
schedule, including an outdoor evening of cinema at the John Anson
Ford Amphitheatre. A coming-of-age film, ``Edge of Seventeen'' by
David Moreton and Todd Stephens, will be featured.
</P>
<P>
   Winners in the six juried, six audience and two special
programming categories will receive ``Outies.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign films from 25 countries are included. Sir Ian McKellen
(``Richard III,'' ``Gods and Monsters'') will be presented with a
lifetime achievement award for excellence in gay filmmaking.

DISAGREEMENT MARS ACCORD ON ANIMAL TREATMENT IN CHINATOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIE CHAO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Brokers of a compromise agreement on the humane
treatment of live animals in Chinatown markets fear the deal is
falling apart even before it is to take effect.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese merchants and their representatives appear to be
backpedaling from an agreement signed earlier this year to kill and
store animals humanely. Part of the agreement is scheduled to be
implemented July 1.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has been a hot one in San Francisco's Chinatown for
more than two years. It is an ideological and procedural quagmire
that combines science, ethics, culture and, as some Chinese are
fond of pointing out, 5,000 years of history.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fear is, if this fails, it'll end up being a racial issue
which will divide the city,'' said City Administrator Bill Lee, who
has helped negotiate between merchants and animal groups.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was brokered by the San Francisco Society for
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Chinese Consolidated
Benevolent Association, a group with a 150 year history in
Chinatown that is also known as the Chinese Six Companies.
</P>
<P>
   It is a voluntary set of guidelines. The rules on killing
animals take effect July 1 and rules on storing animals go into
effect Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   After the agreement was signed, the SPCA began to hold weekly
meetings with merchants to discuss implementation, such as humane
ways to kill a turtle.
</P>
<P>
   Separate from the SPCA agreement is a lawsuit filed in April by
a coalition of animal groups, not including the SPCA, asking for an
end to all sales of live animals for food in San Francisco. The
groups sued after the city's Board of Supervisors declined to enter
into the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Closing arguments in the trial were heard in late April and a
Superior Court judge has until late July to issue a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things were moving along pretty well when the attorney
representing the merchants in the litigation basically advised his
clients to not attend the meetings pending the outcome of the
litigation,'' said SPCA President Richard Avanzino.
``Unfortunately, that brought our discussions to a screeching
halt.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Wartelle, the lawyer representing the merchants, denied he
instructed his clients to stop attending the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   However, in a letter dated April 28 to the Chinese Six
Companies, Wartelle clearly stated that he instructed his clients
to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Wartelle said his clients already meet the guidelines in the
agreement, including not dismembering or cutting an animal while it
is alive. But several animal rights activists said they have
witnessed live turtles being de-shelled in Chinatown markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately we're still facing some internal politics in the
community,'' said Pius Lee, a real estate broker and community
figure helping with negotiations between merchants and animal
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain groups are encouraging the merchants to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Avanzino said the agreement should be implemented regardless of
the outcome of the litigation, which could drag on with appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reconciliation is superior to litigation or legislation that
creates winners and losers,'' he said. ``We're trying to achieve a
win-win accommodation, as opposed to an outcome where one side
could raise the flag of victory, angering and upsetting the other
side.''
</P>
<P>
   The SPCA and the Chinese Six Companies are preparing to send a
letter to merchants urging them to resume discussions.
</P>
<P>
   The city administrator, Bill Lee, said the voluntary guidelines
would avert escalating the disagreement from a cultural one to a
racial one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people don't come to the table and talk, we're never going
to resolve anything,'' the city administrator said. ``If we can't
resolve an issue of live turtles and frogs, how are we going to
resolve other ethnic and cultural differences in the city?''

DAG REMAINS TRUE TO R&AMP;B SOUNDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; On its first album four years ago, the funky
North Carolina band Dag proved it could lay down deep soul grooves
in an age of synthetic effects.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Apartment 635'' (Columbia) due Tuesday, Dag is still
doing things the old-fashioned way. Influenced by such vintage r&AMP;b
acts as Stevie Wonder, War and Sly Stone, the six-member group
makes organic dance music that holds up in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of it was a conscious effort,'' says Dag guitarist Brian
Dennis. ``We were on the road for a long time supporting our first
album, and that gave us a lot of time to sit around listening to
CDs. The new record reflects the music we've been listening to for
the past four years.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest disc also features the addition of two new members _
keyboardist-singer Jen Gunderman and keyboardist Kai Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recorded the record one song at a time,'' Dennis said.
``We've never been a band that does basic tracks, then adds vocals,
then does overdubs. I think people do that mostly for financial
reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis said the hometown music scene is a close-knit one. Fellow
Raleigh, N.C., bands Ben Folds Five and Squirrel Nut Zippers
rehearse in the same building.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really looking forward to the road,'' the guitarist
said. ``We pride ourselves on the fact that we're an r&AMP;b band that
plays clubs. There just aren't many bands anymore that play
straight-ahead r&AMP;b. We want to come to every city and turn it
out.''
</P>
<P>
   MICHEL'LE BACK IN ACTION: Michel'le was one of the original
hip-hop/r&AMP;b fusion kids in the early '90s, with a couple of hits
under her belt, when she signed with Death Row Records.
</P>
<P>
   That was six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The troubled rap label has finally released its first Michel'le
album, ``Hung Jury,'' which continues the mix of classic soul and
hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knew that hip-hop and r&AMP;b would blend together the way
that it has when we were recording my first album,'' Michel'le said
in her Minnie Mouse-on-helium speaking voice. ``I was part of the
rap world back then, and it just made sense for my music to use
tracks that, up until then, only rappers rhymed over.''
</P>
<P>
   Michel'le was a teen working in a Los Angeles department store
when she began winning talent shows for her singing. Eventually,
she started working with the late Eazy-E on her self-titled debut
album.
</P>
<P>
   She signed with Death Row in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rap was a top priority for Death Row at the time, so I
continued writing songs, raising my son and building my clothing
business,'' Michel'le said. ``I had opportunities to record but I
didn't agree with the creative direction they wanted me to go in.
Now, it's my time, and I can't wait to share my music with the
world again.''
</P>
<P>
   GETTING URBAN: More than 50 panels, workshops and demo listening
sessions are set for the Urban Focus Music Conference on Saturday
and Sunday at the Musicians Institute, 1655 McCadden Place,
Hollywood. The second annual event deals with issues in r&AMP;b and
hip-hop music. Advance registration is still available through
today for $75. Information: (310) 289-6350.

EXPERIENCING `NIRVANA'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; She could be a refugee from a '50s sci-fi serial,
or the high priestess of some exotic cyber-based religion.
</P>
<P>
   Extending a tentative hand in greeting, artist Mariko Mori is
swathed in space-age fibers: a gleaming white dress so slick it
looks waterproof, accented by a silver pocketbook and the kind of
footgear Jane Fonda might have favored in ``Barbarella.''
</P>
<P>
   If Mori and her work represent the shape of things to come, then
this summer the Los Angeles County Museum of Art will be the
cultural equivalent of a Silicon Valley research lab.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than seeing technology as art's implacable foe, Mori
regards it as a potential ally in the quest for spiritual
equilibrium. Not unlike her attire, her art is all about distilling
harmony from opposites: nature and technology, East and West,
fantasy and reality, ancient Buddhist spirituality and 21st-century
materialism.
</P>
<P>
   Mori explores those themes in ``Nirvana,'' a large-scale
multimedia installation consisting of four billboard-sized
photographs, a 3-D video, a lotus-shaped acrylic sculpture and
another video accompanied by a series of photo stills.
</P>
<P>
   The show's predominant images are of uncanny landscapes, filled
with computer-generated cartoon sprites, mysterious globules and
levitating dieties portrayed by Mori herself. Serving in effect as
her own producer, director, costume designer, cinematographer,
location scout and star, Mori constructs hallucinatory environments
that she thinks of not as whimsical playlands, but as gateways to
new, futuristic realms of perception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtual reality will actually help us to create new space. I
think it will actually help us with our consciousness,'' says Mori,
31, her words edged with a faint British accent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think next century's technology will have a balance between
materialism and technology and nature and culture. We have to
rethink traditional Eastern philosophy of Buddhism, Taoism, which
talks a lot about balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Balance appears to be central to Mori's personality as well as
her art, which first caught the world's attention at last year's
Venice Biennale.
</P>
<P>
   Formal yet forthright, she steers a visitor through LACMA's
galleries with the purposeful politeness of a tea-ceremony hostess,
quietly explaining the intricate Buddhist symbolism that underlies
much of her work.
</P>
<P>
   First stop is a darkened gallery where the seven-minute 3-D
video ``Nirvana'' is being shown. In it, a brilliantly costumed
Mori, impersonating the traditional Japanese goddess Kichijoten,
floats out from the screen surrounded by tiny Claymation spirits
resembling Asian Teletubbies, which Mori calls ``tunes.''
</P>
<P>
   Each ``tune'' plays a traditional Japanese instrument as it
floats by on a frothy blue cloud. Simultaneously, Mori's 3-D image
begins to sing and perform a dance combined with hand positions
known as mudra, used in Buddhist art to signify particular mental
states. Though the words sound like ancient incantations, Mori
later confesses with a giggle that they're actually snippets of
Japanese pop songs.
</P>
<P>
   Though Mori's Zen-drag performance flirts with campiness,
there's not a speck of irony here. Overall, the video induces a
meditative calm, not the hyperactive buzz usually associated with
high technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not an engineer,'' Mori emphasizes. ``I don't have any
skills to create technology. I'm interested in how to use
technology to create new ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Mori's theatrical flair stems from her early training in fashion
design at Bunka Fashion College in her native Tokyo. Later she
turned to photography in London before taking up a one-year
independent study program at the Whitney Museum of Art, which
brought her to the United States in 1992. Today she maintains
studios in Tokyo and New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Spirituality is a new twist in Mori's evolution. In earlier
works she often posed as a cyborg doll, enacting ancient Japanese
rituals amid sterile urban surroundings. Her 1996 video ``Miko no
inori (The shaman-girl's prayer),'' included in LACMA's exhibition,
was shot in Osaka's antiseptic Kansai International Airport. Mori
appears in a frosty blond wig, her eyes tinted a chilling ice-blue,
menacingly stroking a crystal ball while indifferent passengers
stream by.
</P>
<P>
   A less robotic persona emerges in ``Nirvana,'' which uses
natural marvels, not anonymous urbanscapes, for backdrops. The
exhibition's largest gallery is devoted to the four oversized
photo-murals incorporating vistas of the Gobi Desert, the Dead Sea,
Arizona's Painted Desert and France's Massif Cave. Collectively,
these sites correspond to the Buddhist elements of nature _ wind,
water, fire, earth and empty space _ derived from the structure of
mandalas, which are circular designs symbolizing wholeness in
Buddhist and Hindu imagery.
</P>
<P>
   Mori appears in all four photographs, mostly in flowing
costumes, with wigs or elaborately sculpted headpieces she creates
herself. In some she proffers lotus blossoms or other ceremonial
objects. In the mural titled ``Entropy of Love,'' the artist and
her sister float in a UFO-like bubble above a surreal terrain that
combines elements of the Painted Desert, a California wind-power
station and the dome of the Biosphere outside Tucson, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Mori's ideas about technology attain perhaps their most tangible
form in the final gallery. Here hangs the ``Enlightenment
Capsule,'' a see-through teardrop-shaped acrylic sculpture
incorporating a stylized lotus blossom that suggests a cocktail
table lifted from a '60s airport lounge.
</P>
<P>
   The sculpture is lit from within by a special fiber-optic cable
that draws daylight from a special tube connected to one of the
museum's outdoor patios. The beam is then filtered so as to remove
ultraviolet and infrared rays, leaving only light of the utmost
purity, Mori says.
</P>
<P>
   In this way, she elaborates, the artificial lotus mimics a real
lotus blossom, which grows out of mud but is untainted by it _ just
as Buddha was born into this world, but transcended it through
meditation and achieved the state of nirvana.
</P>
<P>
   ``The human not only exists as a body, as material, but there
also is a spirit which keeps moving,'' Mori observes. That same
spirit should move other pilgrims to seek out ``Nirvana'' this
summer.

QUEST FOR THE PERFECT TANGO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Luis Bravo knows there are many other tango shows
out there.
</P>
<P>
   Too many?
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I didn't see the other ones,'' replies the
ever-diplomatic musician and impresario.
</P>
<P>
   As for judging the relative merits of these fast-spawning tango
tributes, Bravo demurs, ``I leave that for the people.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past eight years, the people have been voting with their
feet by the tens of thousands for Bravo's ``Forever Tango.''
</P>
<P>
   After opening at UCLA in 1990, where it played nine weeks,
``Forever Tango'' has toured in Argentina, London and New York. It
returned to Los Angeles in 1994 for an engagement at the Wiltern
Theatre and later spent a phenomenal 92 weeks in San Francisco,
where it was voted Best Touring Musical of 1996 by the Bay Area
Theatre Critics.
</P>
<P>
   Such success would seem to certify ``Forever Tango'' as a
genuine cult article. But then tango's darkly eroticized nature has
always inspired a furtive following.
</P>
<P>
   Bravo, however, insists that despite its clenched couplings and
its origins in Buenos Aires brothels, tango is not primarily about
sex.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, he says, tango speaks to the loneliness of the
sailors and cowboys who landed in Buenos Aires after leaving their
families behind in Europe. Tango's melancholy, nostalgic sound
externalizes the pain of the immigrant's isolation, he says, and
its stylized aggression suggests a subliminal death wish more than
sexual passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You dance it by yourself, with your own history,'' he
observes. ``You dance it with somebody, but you're by yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Bravo finds a similar quality of painful yearning in
African-American spirituals, although tango reverberates with
something closer to fatalistic despair than hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to do with the Argentinian psychology. Argentinians are
very unstable people because of our heritage and our history,''
says Bravo, who has made his home in the Los Angeles area since the
early 1980s. ``Our history changes every 30 years with the economy,
in cycles. Argentinian people never know about their future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes us a very fatalstiic people. That's why everything in
Argentina is a Greek tragedy. It comes from the Italians, you know.
We're Latins.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, so much for subtext.
</P>
<P>
   What really sets his show apart from its imitators, Bravo
believes, is its emphasis on music. A cellist himself for many
years, Bravo gave his last concert in 1993 with the National
Symphony of Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   He calls ``Forever Tango'' a very simple show and particularly
loves one critic's description of it as an ``illustrated concert.''
</P>
<P>
   In performance, he wants audiences to experience the passion of
the music _ as well as the passion of the dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a big passion and conviction of what you're
doing. It's an obsession of perfection. And being a musician, it's
your destiny to have that obsession for perfection.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: MANAGING THE POLITICS OF SURPLUS
 &HT;    For release Sunday, June 28
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It took the end of the Cold War for the Senate to
debate and approve the expansion of the NATO security umbrella to
Eastern Europe. It will take until the end of the debate over
federal budget deficits for the Congress to approve Social Security
reform.
</P>
<P>
   No longer is Social Security legislation widely viewed as the
``third rail of American politics _ touch it and you die.'' A broad
consensus has emerged that the program must be fixed in one way or
another _ if only because otherwise, sooner or later, it will go
broke. The game has changed into one of when to act, how to present
it to the people, and, most important, just what should be done.
</P>
<P>
   It looks as if 1999 will be the year of Social Security. That's
because both Republicans and Democrats have decided to drag their
feet until after the mid-term elections. At the same time, key
figures in both parties want the Social Security issue resolved
before the 2000 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, when Social Security was last on the fiscal ropes,
a Republican president, with backing from congressional Democrats,
named a blue-ribbon panel to cut the needed deal. The legislation
raised payroll premiums well beyond current needs, taxed benefits,
covered federal workers and increased retirement ages in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton will spend some time this year holding forums
around the country, in hopes of building a public consensus of what
to do, which is lacking. Meantime, his own folks have been meeting
in the White House in hopes of building a private consensus within
the administration of what to do, which is also lacking.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely, after these efforts end, Clinton will copy Ronald
Reagan's model and name his own commission, probably in early 1999.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the Social Security trust fund solvent, the next set of
dealers can basically play any one of four tough hands, or maybe
some combination of them. They can either raise taxes, lower
benefits, inflate the currency or privatize the system.
</P>
<P>
   Most reformers, dubbing themselves conservatives, argue that the
last choice is the best one.
</P>
<P>
   They see the 63-year-old system as a huge pyramid scheme _ one
in which taxes drawn from today's younger workers cover the
benefits paid to today's retirees, while tomorrow's benefits for
today's workers are to be paid by tomorrow's taxes on tomorrow's
workers. Without the infusion of fresh cash from equity markets,
the reformers fear rising life expectancies and declining birth
rates will cause the pyramid to topple.
</P>
<P>
   Many preservationists, ducking the liberal label, claim the
would-be reformers fail to tell the whole story.
</P>
<P>
   They view Social Security as a combination pension plan,
insurance plan and income redistribution plan. They note that,
unlike private investment accounts, the system should continue to
provide a much greater return to poor people than to high earners.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, flush with a current budget surplus that would ease the
pain of reform, claims the middle ground. He says some allowance
could be made for private accounts. But he opposes full
privatization ``because then you couldn't have a universal system
that was fair that had a benefit certain.''

   SAINT-ETIENNE, France _ It is a thrilling but dangerous way to
play, falling behind and frantically playing catch up. Three times
in this World Cup, Mexico has given up the first goal, or the first
two goals, and three times it has scrambled back for a victory or a
tie. Thursday, the Netherlands took a 2-0 lead and played for 60
minutes as if there were only one team on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Then Mexico got a goal out of thin air, and four minutes into
extra time it produced another by Luis Hernandez for a stunning 2-2
draw. The result sent both teams into the second round and
threatened to send goalie Jorge Campos to the hospital with a heart
attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like these kind of situations,'' Campos said with a
laugh. ``It's very difficult, a lot of nerves. But this team has
much courage.''
</P>
<P>
   In extra time, the Netherlands (2-0-1) appeared to have held on
for a 2-1 victory to win its group and set up a second-round match
against Germany or Yugoslavia. But Mexico (1-1-1) finished with
sublime desperation, not knowing the result of a simultaneous match
between Belgium and South Korea, and forged a tie despite playing
with only 10 men.
</P>
<P>
   If Belgium had won and Mexico had lost, the Mexicans would have
joined Jamaica and the United States as failures from the North
American, Central American and Caribbean region. As it turned out,
Belgium drew 1-1 with South Korea, but the Mexican players were
unaware of that outcome, so they fought on with relentless
determination.
</P>
<P>
   They were rewarded in the 94th minute, when substitute forward
Ricardo Pelaez bounced a header toward the charging Hernandez. Jaap
Stam, the Dutch defender, had smothered Hernandez all afternoon,
but this time he whiffed upon trying to clear the pass and
Hernandez punched a left-footed shot for the tying goal.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates mobbed him, and when the game ended, the Mexican
players did airplane dives in delirious exhilaration as their fans
chanted ``Ole, ole, ole'' and tossed sombreros at their heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has a lot of character to come back in the second
half,'' said Hernandez, the diminutive blond forward who wears a
rawhide strap for a sweatband. ``From a young age, we all develop a
winning attitude. It is in our blood.''
</P>
<P>
   In the opener, Mexico gave up a goal before routing South Korea
3-1. Then it gave up two goals to Belgium before earning a
white-knuckled 2-2 tie. Again Thursday, it spotted the Netherlands
a pair of goals by Phillip Cocu in the fourth minute and Ronald
DeBoer in the 18th minute before frenetically pulling even. Mexico,
as the second place finisher in its group, will now play Germany or
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holland is one of the favorites and we demonstrated that
Mexico can compete with these teams,'' Pelaez said. ``We are not
afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelaez and midfielder Jesus Arellano had the effect of jumper
cables, entering in the second half and energizing Mexico's dead
battery. In the 75th minute, Pelaez bounded a header off a corner
kick into the net as teammate Cuahtemoc Blanco shielded Edwin
Vander Der Sar, the Dutch goalie. The goal was the first
surrendered by Holland in this World Cup and halved its lead to
2-1.
</P>
<P>
   In the 89th minute, Ramon Ramirez, the Mexican playmaker, was
ejected for vehemently protesting an offsides ruling that negated
the apparent tying goal by Blanco. Shorthanded, Mexico still scored
again in extra time. For the first time, it qualified for the
second round in a World Cup held outside North America.
</P>
<P>
   Before the World Cup, Mexico appeared to be in full panic. It
fired Bora Milutinovic despite not losting a game in the final
round of qualifying. Then it came to Europe two months ago and
played miserably in exhibition matches, threatening the job of
Milutinovic's replacement, Manuel LaPuente.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them to have faith,'' LaPuente said. ``You can never
lose faith.''

AMERICA IS GETTING LITTLE EUROPEAN HELP IN JAPAN CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   News Analysis  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BERNARD D. KAPLAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ In dealing with the Japanese financial crisis, America
finds itself virtually alone, getting little help from its friends.
</P>
<P>
   It's a familiar situation for U.S. officials. Ever since Asia's
economic storm burst nearly a year ago, they have found themselves
carrying most of the burden in trying to contain the damage
although several other western nations including Germany, France
and Britain are also heavy investors in the region.
</P>
<P>
   German economist Wolfgang Munchau, writing in Britain's
Financial Times, noted that, while European officials expect their
new single currency, the euro, to supplant the dollar as the
dominant world currency, last week's massive monetary intervention
to bolster the staggering Japanese yen would not have occurred
under European aegis because ``nobody would have been in charge.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to America's ability to take the necessary crisis
measures alone and quickly, the Europeans have no capacity for
united action despite their claim to have created a monetary union
with political backup, he said.
</P>
<P>
   So the European authorities, as usual, waited for Washington to
act and were content to serve as cheer leaders for the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, officials of the so-called Group of Seven
industrial nations met in Tokyo to consider how to deal with
Japan's long-running banking woes, which are the key problem in
that country's stumbling economy.
</P>
<P>
   But few observers were fooled by the presence of representatives
of France, Britain, Germany, Italy and Canada as well as the United
States and Japan. The G7 it may have been, but as a French
newspaper pointed out, ``What really mattered was the Group of One,
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort to persuade inward-looking Japanese officials to take
swift steps to meet the crisis that has dealt a sharp blow to the
international value of the yen has really been a U.S. endeavor. As
far as the other western nations are concerned, Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin has performed as chief strategist and field commander
in the battle to prevent Japan's problems from spilling over
globally and possibly setting off a worldwide recession.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union's Executive Commission in Brussels has
undisguised ambitions to be the continent's government.
Nonetheless, its president, Jacques Santer, has been remarkably
silent about Japan and the Asian crisis as a whole. ~``Santer
possesses no mandate to deal with such matters and he knows it,''
according to Laurent Wilms, a Paris banker and specialist on the
EU. ``Individual EU governments would pounce on him if he tried.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the European Central Bank, created to manage the euro,
now exists under its Dutch president, Wim Duisenberg, it lacks
authority over such questions as intervention in currency markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nearly everything is still unclear,'' said Frankfurt banker
Reinhold Meltzer. ``Governments still consider currency
intervention to be a national perogative. How cooperation will be
handled between the European Central Bank and the EU finance
ministers remains unsettled.''
</P>
<P>
   The German financial expert said, ``It will take years for these
questions to be worked out. Until they are, the euro is likely to
have a strictly limited impact on the world scene.''
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the role of riding to the rescue in international
economic crises to the United States and its trusty dollar.

DANCER ALERT: PILOBOLUS HOLDS AN OPEN AUDITION  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 28) 
</HEADLINE>

 Terry Teachout is the music critic of Commentary and a contributing
writer for Time magazine.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WEDNESDAY, MAY 27, 11:30 a.m. Forty barefoot women are lined up
along the dingy walls of City Center's fourth-floor rehearsal hall,
waiting to improvise a 30-second dance that could change their
lives. Some look alert, some nonchalant, a few terrified. All are
here in response to a terse notice posted in a handful of New York
dance studios and published in the trade press: Pilobolus Dance
Theater is holding open auditions, starting today.
</P>
<P>
   Between now and Friday, one of these women will crash through
the blank wall of anonymity and win a place in one of the world's
most popular modern-dance troupes. Not only will audiences across
the country applaud her, but she will also earn a living wage,
perhaps for the first time in her career as a professional dancer.
</P>
<P>
   Most dancegoers know Pilobolus as a company famous for its wit
and sensuality. These qualities will be on display in the three
programs being presented during the group's annual monthlong season
at the Joyce Theater, which opens Tuesday night with the New York
premiere of ``The Hand That Mocked, The Heart That Fed,'' a new
dance featuring an original score by the noted jazz composer Maria
Schneider.
</P>
<P>
   (Two other dances, ``Apoplexy'' and ``Orangotango,'' will
receive their New York premieres during the run.)
</P>
<P>
   But professional dancers also know Pilobolus as one of the few
modern-dance troupes that provides a regular paycheck, a rare
commodity in a profession whose members regard unemployment
benefits as an integral part of their skimpy incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the company's six dancers performed about 130 shows
and were paid 45 weeks out of 52. That's one reason more than 200
people showed up today to compete for the jobs of Tamieca McCloud,
Trebien Pollard and Mark Santillano, who are leaving at the end of
the season to pursue their own projects.
</P>
<P>
   Though the company's four artistic directors are in the enviable
position of being able to take their pick of some of the best
dancers in the business, they know their requirements are unusually
idiosyncratic. Many otherwise talented dancers are baffled by
Pilobolus's elusive style, a homegrown blend of gymnastics, modern
dance and performance art; moreover, the company's dances are
choreographed collaboratively, with the dancers playing a key role
in the creative process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't looking for conventional dancers,'' says Jonathan
Wolken, the executive director and one of the company's founders in
1971. Just as important, he adds, is the need to hire mature men
and women who are capable of getting along during the many weeks
they will spend together on the road. ``It's a tightly knit family,
and the emotional weather is very important,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Wolken, Robby Barnett, Michael Tracy and Alison
Chase have devised a system that allows them to sift more or less
efficiently through the large numbers of dancers their auditions
invariably attract.
</P>
<P>
   In the first stage, the dancers learn a phrase, then perform it
in groups of eight, after which they are allowed to improvise
briefly on their own. ``It's grueling,'' Wolken says, ``but it's
also fun to watch, a kind of human circus.''
</P>
<P>
   THURSDAY, 10:45 a.m. Ten women and nine men were called back for
the second day of auditions. Rebecca Anderson, a friendly faced
blonde who is Pilobolus's dance captain, is concentrating on the
women this morning. ``I'm looking for somebody with some spark to
her,'' she says. ``And of course she has to be able to lift me, and
I her. We had to cut some of the bigger women yesterday just for
that reason.'' (Ms. Anderson is 5 feet 4 inches.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Anderson and Ms. McCloud demonstrate a phrase from ``Duet,''
an intricate exercise in female partnering. Then the women pair off
and repeat it. ``Watch the way they lift each other, and the way
they're lifted,'' Wolken whispers. ``Who's a sack of potatoes?
Who's a part of a sculpture? Who's doing Rodin? Who's
embarrassed?''
</P>
<P>
   A petite dancer with exotic features is singled out for special
treatment, and as Ms. Anderson helps her polish the phrase, you can
see the other women trying to decide whether their chances for
success have gone up or down.
</P>
<P>
   NOON The directors and dancers huddle briefly and make the next
cut. Then the six men and six women who are left are told how
Pilobolus works. Members are expected to live near the company
studio, in rural Connecticut; there are no understudies, so
everybody must be willing to dance hurt; relationships with
significant others are often strained by the lengthy touring
schedule; some dances involve full or partial nudity. ``You're
going to be lonely, hurt, poor and naked,'' interjects Matt Kent,
Pilobolus's class clown. Everybody laughs; nobody leaves.
</P>
<P>
   FRIDAY, 10:30 a.M. Ben Pring, one of the remaining male dancers,
is taken to the back of the hall for a whispered conference while
the other men continue to improvise. Michael Tracy and Robby
Barnett offer him a job. ``We think you'd be really good,'' says
Tracy, ``and I think you'd find this a good dance job.'' (He will
accept over the weekend.)
</P>
<P>
   11:45 Josie Coyoc, the elfin dancer who was singled out Thursday
morning, has now emerged as one of the two front-runners among the
women. An elegant performer whose demeanor is quiet and
self-contained, she has spent the last five years with Bill T.
Jones's company but is concerned about its financial stability.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to keep dancing,'' she says, ``but I also want to be
able to pay my bills _ I'm actually going into debt _ so I told
Bill in February that I was going to have to look for something
else. It was hard. But I love what Pilobolus does _ all the
partnering, and the beautiful movements.'' Suddenly she starts to
cry. ``It's like leaving one family, perhaps to go to another.''
</P>
<P>
   12:15 p.m. The other front-runner is Jennifer Binford, a tall,
ebullient woman who makes fetchingly funny faces as she improvises.
``This is the most creative audition I've ever had,'' she says
excitedly. ``I feel like I fit in, like I can be myself. I'm having
a great time!'' Then she sheepishly confesses that she hasn't slept
for two days.
</P>
<P>
   1 p.m. One man and three women are sent home. Each is taken
aside and gently given the bad news. ``Dancers are always telling
us: `You treat us like humans; you actually (italics)talk(end
italics) to us!' '' Tracy says after they leave. ``Which gives us
some idea of how things must work at other companies' auditions.''
He shudders.
</P>
<P>
   3:30 p.m. Another male dancer is sent home. The rest line up
side by side as Wolken barks out a series of unlikely commands:
``Look straight out. Relax your face. Now show us pure, unmitigated
hatred ... falling asleep ... one drink too many ... horrified ...
flabbergasted ... you just walked through poison ivy ...
(italics)dignified!''(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   The dancers dissolve in laughter, then sit down for more talk.
``Do any of you keep a journal?,'' Wolken asks them. ``What do you
read?'' The answers range from ``One Hundred Years of Solitude'' to
``The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People.''
</P>
<P>
   4:20 p.m. The directors and company members excuse themselves
and begin an intense, sometimes testy debate. Otis Cook, an
extroverted improviser with a shaved head, is called over for a few
more questions; the group then decides to offer him the second male
slot, which he accepts at once. Choosing between Ms. Binford and
Ms. Coyoc proves more difficult. ``Rebecca was right when she said
that it's basically going to be an esthetic decision,'' Barnett
says. ``Jennifer and Josie are both excellent dancers, they can do
all the moves, but they're very different in size, appearance and
character. So what do we want the company to look like? Where do we
want to go as a group?''
</P>
<P>
   After 20 minutes of increasingly heated talk, a compromise is
reached: the company will assemble in Connecticut next week to make
a final decision, having had the weekend to think it over.
</P>
<P>
   AFTERWARD The members of Pilobolus reconvened the following
Monday and voted unanimously to ask Ms. Coyoc to join them. ``I
needed a day to let it wash over me,'' she says a few weeks later.
``Then I accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   She speaks wistfully of telling her soon-to-be-former boss that
she will be leaving his company: ``I think Bill understood it was a
choice I had to make, so I could continue to do what I love.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Coyoc, Cook and Pring will report to Connecticut on Aug. 10
for their first rehearsal. ``I think we have a terrific looking new
company,'' Barnett says. ``We have a lot of faith in our audition
process. It's not infallible, but it gives us an unusually good
sense of who we're working with, and we've never had to let anyone
go. On the basis of those three days, I think all of us are
positive and enthusiastic about the year to come.''

MASTER OF MOVEMENT DECIDES TO TELL A STORY WITH AN OPERA  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Roslyn Sulcas is writing a book on the choreographer William
Forsythe.  
 By ROSLYN SULCAS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ What makes a master of one art form turn to
another after a lifetime of perfecting and refining her craft? For
the choreographer Trisha Brown, probably the same impulses that
have impelled her to build a career from challenge and change, and
to occasionally infuriate but more often thrill audiences with her
slippery, elusive gestural poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown, at age 61, is an internationally renowned
choreographer, acclaimed for the subtle and complex style of dance
that she has developed with her eponymous company. From
experimental beginnings in the '60s, when she formed part of the
Judson Church group in New York, Ms. Brown has moved toward the
status of an institution: she has performed in famous opera houses,
danced with Mikhail Baryshnikov and Bill T. Jones, received
prestigious awards, and last year celebrated the Trisha Brown
Company's 25th anniversary with a three-program season that drew
from her substantial repertory.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ms. Brown recently put herself in the position of a novice
once again by seeking out and accepting the chance to direct an
opera, a role that had her working for the first time with singers
and musicians as well as her own dancers.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, her production of Claudio Monteverdi's ``Orfeo'' _
regarded as the first important opera in the history of Western
music _ received its premiere to great acclaim at one of Europe's
most distinguished opera houses, La Monnaie in Brussels, as part of
the city's Kusten Festival des Arts.
</P>
<P>
   It later played at the Barbican in London and will next be seen,
starting July 14, in four performances at the Festival
International d'Art Lyrique et de Musique in Aix-en-Provence in
France. Next year it will travel to the Brooklyn Academy of Music. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From her earliest days as a choreographer, Ms. Brown has been
open to a myriad of influences. She has found inspiration in
Manhattan's architecture for early ``equipment'' pieces that set
dancers walking on walls and semaphoring across rooftops. She has
collaborated with artists like Robert Rauschenberg and Donald Judd.
And she has applied John Cage's notions of chance to dance
composition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The classes I took with Robert Dunn when I got to New York
gave me a concept of how one might make art,'' Ms. Brown says.
``And I use that word purposely, as applied to all disciplines. My
training is in dance and choreography, but my connection is to form
and content, as for any artist. Once I understood that, it was just
a matter of time before I could flesh it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown's first working contact with opera came in 1986, when
the filmmaker Lina Wertmuller asked her to choreograph a short
section of ``Carmen.'' The result was a dense movement haiku _ the
entire narrative compressed into a relentless progression across
the stage as the two protagonists moved toward their grim destiny. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Working on `Carmen' was like a vacation,'' she says. ``It was
very enjoyable to have so many elements _ story, history, context _
built in. It's so hard to make what I usually do, strict
abstraction, believable.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown's ``strict abstraction'' involves complex gesture
stripped of narrative context and counterpointed by supple,
beguiling chains of movement that defy the eye to single out
original impulses or rhythmic dynamics. For a long time (until
1981, when she created ``Son of Gone Fishin' '' to a computerized
organ score by Robert Ashley), Ms. Brown eschewed musical
accompaniment, believing that it distracted from the development of
her own style of dancing.
</P>
<P>
   And for another 14 years she used solely contemporary scores,
turning to the canon of classical music for the first time in 1995
with ``M.O.,'' set to J.S. Bach's ``Musical Offering,'' followed in
1996 by ``Twelve-Ton Rose,'' set to Webern.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Brown's sights had in fact been set on opera for some
time, and rather than representing an independent evolution toward
more conventional scores (a view that seemed to fit her growing
status as a pillar of the dance world), the works set to Bach and
Webern were part of the preparation for ``Orfeo.''
</P>
<P>
   `` `Carmen' had opened things up for me,'' Ms. Brown says. ``I
was a little tired of the stigma of abstract art, and I wanted to
reach a wider audience. I began to think about character, the
differences between men and women, and to choreograph
gender-specific roles. I became interested in gesture that is
ostensibly neutral, but nonetheless holds meaning, and the way in
which people read gesture, whether consciously or not. I decided
that I had less life to live than that which I'd already lived, and
thought about what I wanted to do and hadn't done. And it was
opera.''
</P>
<P>
   When Frie Leysen, the founder and director of the Brussels
festival, which had commissioned ``M.O.,'' discovered that it ``was
a dream of Trisha's to do an opera,'' she immediately thought of
the Monteverdi cycle that she had been planning for the 1998
festival. Ms. Leysen talked to Bernard Fouccroulle, the director of
La Monnaie, who had already worked with Ms. Brown on musical issues
concerning ``M.O.''
</P>
<P>
   Fouccroulle didn't hesitate despite the gamble such projects
might seem to represent. ``Opera has enjoyed a renaissance since
the '80s because great theater directors like Peter Sellars and
Robert Wilson gave it new energy,'' he says. ``It seems to me,
though, that dance is in a healthier state today than theater, and
that a choreographer who is perhaps more used to the notion of
abstraction can open up an opera in a new way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown is not the first choreographer to take on opera; Mark
Morris, Martha Clarke, Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker and Pina Bausch,
among others, have all made successful forays into the genre. But
she was determined not to let a lifetime of making dance dictate
the way she would approach her task.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than thinking about ``Orfeo'' in choreographic terms, she
approached the work thematically, aware from the outset that she
wanted to do far more than produce a danced accompaniment to the
singing.
</P>
<P>
   A commission from the American Dance Festival in June 1997
allowed her to develop a physical vocabulary before addressing
other directorial issues (``It made sense to use the opportunity to
work on `Orfeo,' '' Ms. Brown says pragmatically.) But almost from
the moment that Foucroulle confirmed the project in 1995 (three
years, almost to the day, before the opera's premiere on May 14),
Ms. Brown had been reading and analyzing Alessandro Striggio's
libretto with the help of Guillaume Bernardi, a specialist in
Italian Renaissance poetry who also works in theater.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at how Monteverdi had used the text in relation to
the music, where there were spaces for breathing and gesture, how
Trisha's language could fuse with Striggio's,'' Bernardi says. We
literally went through the text word by word, over the course of a
year. She was unbelievably hard-working and precise.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Early in 1997, Ms. Brown began to work with her dancers with the
goal of creating a vocabulary of movement that would be used by
everyone on stage. ``At first we made movement that attempted to
depict what was in the text,'' Ms. Brown says. ``Rounded arms for
mondo, or world, for example. Then I `culled' the gestures to
create a vocabulary that was both abstract and representational. I
wanted to convey the sense of a larger, metaphoric meaning. But I
also retained my criteria for good dance composition, which people
usually don't have to bother about when staging an opera!''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown blocked out each act, piece by piece, often finding
``physical solutions'' to various directorial questions, but
leaving certain sections open when she thought it would be more
useful to work directly with the singers at a later stage. These
physical solutions included the creation of a machine to move
identically costumed (in loose cream-colored pajama suits) singers
and dancers on and off the stage without the contrivance of
conventional exits and entrances.
</P>
<P>
   The result is magical: rippling lines of figures that peel
smoothly around one another and create a unified framing device for
the principal characters without separating the dancers and
singers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not dance per se,'' comments Ms. Brown. ``It's a
theatrical solution that is informed by my ability to structure
movement.'' She decided to place her pure-dance sections (the only
moments where the dancers emerge from the choral group) where she
wanted to build toward climactic moments.
</P>
<P>
   Magical aerial dances, which might be seen as an echo of Ms.
Brown's equipment pieces, were made for Diane Madden as an
incarnation of La Musica, Orfeo's entrance, the loss of Eurydice,
the hero's death.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown also decided to add the opera's original ending _
Orfeo torn to pieces by the Bacchantes _ to the later version in
which he is saved by his father, the god Apollo.
</P>
<P>
   In making these choices, Ms. Brown was both supported and guided
by the musical director, Rene Jacobs. ``He is both incredibly open
to imagination, and immensely knowledgeable about tradition,'' she
says. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Also intricately linked to Ms. Brown's dramatic conception of
the opera is Roland Aeschlimann's striking design and lighting.
They are near-Japanese in their subtle simplicity: a bare stage,
framed by an enormous cutout circle that variously represents the
moon, the sun and the world, glowing with heavenly blues and
oranges and sometimes eclipsed by a wall that moves from right to
left and back again during the course of the work.
</P>
<P>
   Although used to making final decisions about her own work, Ms.
Brown describes this intensely collaborative experience as sheer
heaven, ``if fair argumentation can be called heaven!'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During a six-week period in Brussels last fall, collaboration
became more complex as each singer _ chorus as well as principals _
was tutored by a dancer in the movement vocabulary specific to his
or her role. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We were amazed that dancers knew the music and words better
than we did at that stage,'' says Simon Keenlyside, who is Orfeo in
one of the two casts. ``Trying to learn the movement was
horrendously embarrassing at first, but ultimately it's one of the
most interesting things I've ever done. We're certainly not
dancing, but we are doing a form of what Trisha wants, and it's
part of the musical experience. There are times in performance when
I don't know whether I'm singing or moving because conceptually
it's so fused.''
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, as ``Orfeo'' unfolded, it became clear that Ms.
Brown had neither produced a choreographed version of the opera,
amplified by singing, nor echoed the sung narrative in analogous
dances.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, she has used her medium _ movement _ to clarify and
enlarge the musical domain, incorporating musicians, singers and
dancers into the same dramatic universe with rare skill and
finesse.
</P>
<P>
   After the hugely successful premiere in Brussels, Ms. Brown
confessed that she had felt ``completely numb'' while watching the
performance. ``I had to remind myself to breathe,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But breathe she did later when, glowing with pleasure, Ms. Brown
accepted the tributes of the audience. Once again she had succeeded
in her restless refusal to accept familiar solutions; she had
reinvented her own visions and in the process had reimagined a
genre.

`CARLA'S SONG': JOBLESS SCOT IN NICARAGUA DISCOVERS POLITICAL
INSIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Production notes at end)  
 (JT)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine a more unlikely visitor to Central America
in wartime than George (Robert Carlyle), an unemployed Scottish bus
driver who is astounded to find himself in mortal peril jouncing
along a rutted mountain road in Nicaragua with a group of soldiers
dressed in camouflage. It is 1987, when right-wing contras are
waging a guerrilla war against the leftist Sandinista government,
and George has impulsively flown all the way from Glasgow with his
Nicaraguan fiancee Carla (Oyanka Cabezas) on a risky quest that
could turn out to be a wild-goose chase.
</P>
<P>
   George's culture shock and political awakening form the
emotional core of Ken Loach's angry and sorrowful film ``Carla's
Song.'' This intermittently powerful film, directed from a
screenplay by Paul Laverty, is never quite sure of what kind of
movie it wants to be. In its early scenes, which have a
documentary-like realism, it appears to be a microscopic
examination of the life of a discontented city worker whose chafing
at the rules of his job have an unexpectedly shattering effect on
his life. Later, it becomes a somewhat unwieldy allegory in which
the search for a casualty of war assumes Conradian allegorical
overtones.
</P>
<P>
   The bus driver's journey into a strange new life begins when he
takes pity on a mysterious passenger who is being harassed by the
police for not paying her fare. George's resistance, along with
other small acts of rebellion, cause him to be dismissed from his
seemingly secure job. And when he befriends and falls in love with
the passenger he defended, a beautiful Nicaraguan refugee named
Carla who dances in the streets to raise money for the Sandinista
cause, the rigid moorings of his life become untethered.
</P>
<P>
   Carla, whom Ms. Cabezas portrays with a quicksilver intensity
that cuts against acting cliches, turns out to be a lot more
trouble than George had bargained for. Suffering from
post-traumatic stress, she is suicidal. As bits and pieces of her
story emerge, George becomes convinced that the only way she can
conquer her demons is to return to Nicaragua to find a former lover
and fellow Sandinista named Antonio, who was caught and tortured by
the contras and who has since disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, ``Carla's Song'' lurches boldly but unsteadily
into a hybrid of quasi documentary, angry political tract and
turgid fable. Abruptly moving from Glasgow to Nicaragua, the movie
plunges you into the state of dazed bewilderment that George
experiences in his first few days abroad. And in the not terribly
believable figure of Bradley (Scott Glenn), a hard-boiled former
CIA operative who is now a conscience-stricken worker for a human
rights organization, it also gives the movie its blunt political
mouthpiece.
</P>
<P>
   A former enemy turned advocate of the Sandinista cause, and a
witness to unspeakable CIA-sponsored atrocities, Bradley is
bursting with secrets, most of which are withheld until the end of
the film. It turns out he knows where the elusive Antonio is
living. The movie wastes valuable time withholding information to
build up a bogus head of suspense that turns out not to have been
justified once the ugly but unsurprising facts are revealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carla's Song'' is at its most effective in scenes that feel
semi-improvised, in which George breaks through the barriers of
language and culture to establish a warm camaraderie with
Sandinista soldiers and peaceful villagers who are under attack
from the contras. Its portrait of an idealistic peasant-based army
and its supporters standing up to a ruthless enemy is unabashedly
nostalgic for the leftist dream the Sandinistas once represented.

`SMOKE SIGNALS': 2 IDAHO INDIANS TRACE A SHARED PAST  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; ``Smoke Signals'' was shown as part of this year's New
Directors/New Films Series. Here are excerpts from Janet Maslin's
review, which appeared in The New York Times on March 27. The film
opens Friday. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Victor Joseph (Adam Beach) and Thomas Builds-the-Fire (Evan
Adams) are Coeur d'Alene Indians living in Idaho, characters drawn
by Sherman Alexie from his sharply etched, mordant book of stories,
``The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven.'' Lighter and less
bittersweet on screen, and adapted by Alexie into a splendid
screenplay, these tales describe a contemporary American Indian
culture coming to terms with its past in offbeat, unexpected ways.
These range from casual asides about George Armstrong Custer to the
patter of the reservation's radio station, where ``It's a good day
to be indigenous!'' is a way to greet the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas and Victor are opposites, with their fates linked by a
calamity from the cradle. Thomas was an infant when his parents,
who had been drinking heavily, were killed in a fire; it was Arnold
Joseph (Gary Farmer), Victor's father, who saved him. The boys have
been rivals and opposites ever since. Victor is the bigger and
sterner of the two, with Thomas as his screwball sidekick. It is
Victor, for instance, who accuses Thomas of having gotten his ideas
of Indian behavior from too many viewings of ``Dances With Wolves''
and advises him to quit grinning, start scowling and toughen up.
</P>
<P>
   As played by Beach and Adams, these two become enormously
likable characters during the easygoing course of the story.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a first feature from Chris Eyre, a 28-year-old
Cheyenne-Arapaho filmmaker, that has an American Indian cast and
outlook. And it needs no dispensation for novelty: it stands
beautifully on its own merits. Eyre presents an inviting,
affectionate and witty look at contemporary Indian lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smoke Signals'' stays home at first, describing such
reservation fixtures as the radio traffic scout who sits parked in
the middle of nowhere, filing bulletins. (``Ain't no traffic,
really.'' ``Big truck just went by. Now it's gone.'') Then it moves
on to the more serious business of Arnold Joseph's fate. As is
gradually revealed, Arnold left years earlier to start a new life
near Phoenix, damaging both boys and his battle-scarred wife,
Arlene (Tantoo Cardinal) in the process. With her son, Arlene
refers to this as ``your daddy's magic act: he sawed us all into
pieces, didn't he?''
</P>
<P>
   As childhood flashbacks reveal the boozy outbursts that colored
Arnold's life with his family, his loved ones learn that he
recently died far from home. So Thomas and Victor, calling a
temporary truce to their own jokey rivalry, go off in search of
him. ``You're leaving the Rez and going into a whole different
country, Cousin,'' one young Indian woman teases. But aren't they
traveling in the United States? ``Damn right it is!'' adds her
girlfriend. ``That's as foreign as it gets.''
</P>
<P>
   We see what that means as soon as Thomas and Victor board a bus,
but culture clash is not the film's main concern. Instead, it lets
the two travelers reinvent their friendship in light of a new
understanding of what Arnold meant to each as a father, and they
discover (through Arnold's loyal latter-day companion, played by
Irene Bedard) how Arnold himself struggled with the weight of the
past. The film's serious underpinnings are not obscured by
charming, mostly lighthearted performances or by frequent flashes
of Alexie's wry humor. It's as natural as anything else, for
example, for Thomas and Victor to make up a little song about John
Wayne's teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Though this is very much a first feature, ``Smoke Signals''
shows colorful style and a wisdom beyond precocity about its
setting and its people.

`VOYAGE TO THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD': FADING IN A WORLD THAT
SEEMED ETERNAL  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; ``Voyage to the Beginning of the World'' was shown as part of
last year's New York Film Festival. Here are excerpts from Stephen
Holden's review, which appeared in The New York Times on Oct. 6.
The film opens Friday. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Wisdom is bodily decrepitude,'' wrote William Butler Yeats,
who railed as eloquently as anyone about the indignities of
senescence. This bitter observation runs to the heart of ``Voyage
to the Beginning of the World,'' an exquisitely sad and moving
reflection on memory and personal roots by the 88-year-old
Portuguese-French director Manoel de Oliveira.
</P>
<P>
   The movie also is the final film of Marcello Mastroianni, who
completed it shortly before his death and appears to be seriously
ailing on the screen. Pale and gaunt and moving unsteadily with a
cane, the great Italian actor gives one of his finest performances
as a stand-in for the director, a crotchety old realist who has no
use for the soothing blandishments of his younger traveling
companions while they tour Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voyage to the Beginning of the World'' is really two vignettes
stuck together. In the first part of the film, Mastroianni
(portraying a director named Manoel) and three colleagues, one of
them a 40-ish actor named Afonso (Jean-Yves Gautier), travel around
rural Portugal. Along the way, Afonso, a successful French
television actor born in Portugal, decides to pay an unannounced
visit to an aunt he has never met in an obscure country village.
</P>
<P>
   As the camera lingers on a vandalized roadside sculpture of a
mustached man toting a log, the battered artwork becomes a symbol
of the aged director himself carrying on in a world that barely
seems to notice. A visit to an abandoned, crumbling, once grand
hotel powerfully evokes the impermanence of a physical world that
seemed almost eternal.
</P>
<P>
   Manoel's childhood memories are only a prelude to Afonso's
heart-rending meeting with his ancient aunt, Maria Afonso (Isabel
de Castro), a cadaverous, hard-bitten crone dressed in black who
initially refuses to accept him as a relative because he doesn't
speak Portuguese. The spare, hand-to-mouth way of life the old
woman shares with her aged husband is clearly on the verge of
extinction. And as she reminisces about wars in other places that
have drawn away the young men of the village, where livestock is
still herded through the winding stone streets, the place feels
like a spiritual oasis.
</P>
<P>
   The film's rhythm is the measured contemplative pace of a mature
filmmaker moving slowly and taking deliberate care to observe the
world as clearly and fully as his senses allow. As the car glides
through the countryside, the camera is always pointed back, and the
pictures of the world literally receding have a piercing poignancy.

`BUFFALO '66': MAYBE YOU CAN GO HOME AGAIN, BUT WHY IN THE WORLD
WOULD YOU?  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; ``Buffalo '66'' was shown as part of this year's New
Directors/New Films Series. Here are excerpts from Janet Maslin's
review, which appeared in The New York Times on April 3. The film
opens Friday. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In Vincent Gallo's ``Buffalo '66,'' Billy Brown (Gallo) steals a
blond kewpie doll named Layla (Christina Ricci) out of her tap
dancing class and browbeats her into masquerading as his wife at a
dinner with his parents. Billy hectors, cajoles and tries to bribe
Layla. (``You can eat all the food you want. Just make me look
good.'') He threatens both that he will kill her and that he won't
be her best friend. He bullies her outrageously but with such crazy
brio and jittery persistence that Layla falls for him. Gallo's film
works on its audience in much the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Having acted for filmmakers as adventurous and diverse as Abel
Ferrara, Aki Kaurismaki, Claire Denis and Emir Kusturica (and
served as the embodiment of junkie chic in Calvin Klein
advertisements), the gaunt, hollow-eyed Gallo knows how to cut a
striking figure. Skinny and volatile, hunching as if he's cold no
matter what the weather, he looks comically desperate from the very
start of this story. The film's opening sequence finds him being
released from prison (``I was innocent,'' he later explains) and
then refusing to go away. Next thing Billy knows, he is wild to use
a bathroom and begging a prison guard to let him back in. Clearly
Billy has some issues with the concept of home.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take long to see why. The visit to Billy's parents,
played with sly finesse by Anjelica Huston and Ben Gazzara, proves
nightmarish in hilarious ways. Mom is an obsessive Buffalo Bills
fan who sits twitching and clicking a television remote control
while she feigns interest in her son. She has yet to forgive him
for being born on the day of a big game, and in the family photo
gallery Jack Kemp and O.J. Simpson are as well represented as
Billy.
</P>
<P>
   Dad turns out to be the guy from whom Billy inherited his
general misanthropy and excitable temper. At least Billy's father
likes one guest. ``C'mere, honey,'' he keeps saying to Ms. Ricci,
who has stunningly reinvented herself as a baby-blue sexpot for
this role, and who plays Layla with tenderness and shrewd comic
timing. ``Let me hug my new little daughter!''
</P>
<P>
   One loony visit home is enough to underscore Billy's plight and
explain his self-imposed isolation. Despite its utterly despairing
notion of family, the film is openly autobiographical to the point
of using Gallo's hometown, a house where he lived with his parents
and a recording of his father's singing.
</P>
<P>
   Cool, stark compositions and the occasional audacious visual
trick give ``Buffalo '66'' a memorable look even when its narrative
enters an uneventful stretch. The strong cast includes such indie
notables as Rosanna Arquette, Kevin Corrigan and Mickey Rourke.
It's a group that could ordinarily be expected to include Steve
Buscemi, but he would be redundant here. Gallo's nutty, tightly
wound Billy is the only lovable loser ``Buffalo '66'' needs.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: This Fourth of July, think of the
Soviet Union
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Best Fourth of July I remember is the only Fourth of July I
remember crying.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1990. I was in Moscow. This was back when it was still
the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   I'd been there two weeks, staying with Russian friends in their
cramped little apartment _ this in a complex of buildings dating
back to the 1950s and known as Khrushchev's teeth, yellow and
crooked as they were.
</P>
<P>
   My friends were breaking the law simply by having me as a guest.
Russians were forbidden even from being seen on the street talking
with Westerners. Such were the bad old days of communism.
</P>
<P>
   I'd brought a suitcase full of American cigarettes, the coin of
the Soviet realm. That, too, was illegal _ something on the order
of contraband.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anybody ever actually smoked them. They were too
valuable. Russians swapped packs of cigarettes for luxuries
available only through the black market. Food, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   But you couldn't buy a beer in Moscow for any price, except at a
small foreign-owned grocery that catered to diplomats and their
families.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about exclusive. You had to show an American Express card
to get in the door. No kidding.
</P>
<P>
   What I missed most were Cokes over ice. Coca-Colas I could buy
at the diplomat mart. You couldn't find ice anywhere. This in the
country that boasts of Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   But each Fourth of July the U.S. Embassy hosted a celebration at
its country estate, what's called a dacha (rhymes with gotcha.)
Anybody American _ even journalists _ were welcome.
</P>
<P>
   There was baseball, hamburgers, hot dogs, cold beer and, thank
heaven, even Cokes on ice!
</P>
<P>
   Kids were running barefoot. Guys were tossing frisbees. I
remember a pretty lady sitting beneath the shade of a tree, reading
a Danielle Steel novel.
</P>
<P>
   It was like a miracle. It was like America.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Marine color guard marched in, the brass band struck up
``The Star-Spangled Banner'' and everybody stood in reverence as
Old Glory of the United States fluttered in a summer breeze from
atop the flagpole.
</P>
<P>
   There I was, half a world away from home, hand over my heart,
the words of the National Anthem on my lips, and tears rolling down
my cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   Communism has since disappeared from what was the Soviet Union.
For that matter, so has the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The New Russians _ Yuri the Yuppie, if you will _ drive Jeep
Grand Cherokees, pronounced sure-ROCK-yees.
</P>
<P>
   Billboards advertise Wonder Bras.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy a Coca-Cola on most any corner, or coke if that's
what you're into.
</P>
<P>
   Cell phones are everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   So are food stores, with giant neon signs that say ``Food
Stores'' in good ol' American English.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the KGB. Think KFC.
</P>
<P>
   In a way I guess it's a miracle. But it's not America.
</P>
<P>
   There's more to freedom than fast food, fancy cars and franchise
operations. It's a matter of the heart.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure Russia will ever get it right. But being there all
those years ago taught me a lesson in patriotism I'll never forget.
</P>
<P>
   This Fourth of July, be thankful you're an American.
</P>
<P>
   Salute the flag.
</P>
<P>
   Sing the National Anthem.
</P>
<P>
   Shoot off a firecracker.
</P>
<P>
   Shed a tear.

`DR. DOLITTLE': ANIMALS WITH ATTITUDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end)  
 (JT)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When last seen talking to the animals, Dr. Dolittle sounded like
Professor Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison starred in the 1967 musical),
and his unorthodox friends were a treacly crew. That could have
been the beginning and end of the doctor's film career, but the
idea of a nouveau ``Dolittle'' has unexpected appeal. Chalk that up
to Eddie Murphy's ability to play the straight man with hilarious
aplomb, and to the director Betty Thomas' ability to turn kitsch
(``The Brady Bunch Movie'') or worse (``Private Parts'') into
mischievous fun. Her breezy, undemanding ``Dr. Dolittle'' is the
sunniest family film so far this season.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone charting the course of American entertainment over the
last 30 years can predict one thing point-blank: The animals have
gotten ruder. (``Watch your head, I'm flyin' here!'' exclaims one
winged creature.) But they're also funnier, thanks to a stellar
array of vocal talent that gives acerbic flair to the animal
wisecracks. In any case, this ``Dr. Dolittle'' is a children's
storybook compared with Murphy's version of ``The Nutty
Professor.'' Jon Farhat, the visual-effects supervisor who gave
Murphy a believable case of multiple personality disorder for that
film, does an artful, unobtrusive job of integrating
computer-generated animal acting with real creatures here.
</P>
<P>
   In an adaptation that owes little to either the musical
``Dolittle'' or to the well-loved stories by Hugh Lofting, Murphy
plays a mild-mannered San Francisco doctor. He treats only people,
since his father insisted he quit talking to pets many years
before. (Ellen DeGeneres is the voice of the pooch who encouraged
little Dolittle to sniff his grade-school principal.) But as the
film quickly demonstrates, human patients can be a lot less cute
than wildlife. And people doctors may have to contend with
occupational hazards like greedy partners (Oliver Platt, with all
due smarminess) and HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   A life-altering event occurs when the film's main character,
while driving at night, accidentally injures a dog. (See
Kieslowski's ``Red'' for the more sophisticated version of this
premise.) This time, the dog (Norm McDonald) says ``Bonehead!,''
and the amazed Dolittle understands him. Next thing he knows,
Dolittle is driving his daughter's guinea pig on a car trip and the
guinea pig begins sounding like Chris Rock. When the doctor reaches
his destination, he finds a raccoon (Paul Reubens) rooting through
trash and asking, ``Can I get tuna in oil instead of water?''
</P>
<P>
   Like ``The Nutty Professor,'' this film becomes a Jekyll-Hyde
comedy. But this time, it's the creatures who are the wild things
and Murphy who remains the soul of politesse and reason. Or tries
to: the laughs here come from watching Dolittle try to keep up
appearances, as when he hides from his family the presence of
ducks, sheep, a goat and even penguins in their apartment. Even Ace
Ventura would envy the menagerie assembled for this scene.
</P>
<P>
   That Murphy remains the funniest figure in the movie is all the
more amazing since the screenplay (by Nat Mauldin and Larry Levin)
drags him into some inspirational moments (``No matter what
happens, you be who you are, and you love who you are!''), and
since the critters get the best lines. Overheard at the dog pound:
``Dead dog walking'' and ``I am Keyser Soze!'' And this exchange,
between two rat cronies (Reni Santoni and John Leguizamo) when one
gets sick: ``If he dies, I don't know what I'll do!'' ``You'll take
me outside and eat me.'' ``Only out of respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert Brooks plays the troubled tiger who prompts McDonald's
dog to bark, ``Will you stop looking at me like I'm a side dish?''
Replies the tiger wearily, ``Don't flatter yourself, pal.''
</P>
<P>
   The film's human cast includes Ossie Davis, in the brief but
imposing role of Dolittle's father, and Kristen Wilson as his
pretty, exasperated wife. But it's the animal acting that's out of
the ordinary. The pet performers have body and beak language to
suit their dialogue and are smoothly integrated with the people
around them. The creatures look real even when computer-generated.
Murphy has said he faced the acting challenge of delivering much of
his performance to a tennis ball or a moving piece of string. &QL;

 A MERGER THAT MIGHT MAKE SENSE  
 By JAMES SUROWIECKI 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years late, the Telecommunications Reform Act of 1996 has
finally given birth to a deal that might actually break local
phone-service monopolies, as AT&AMP;T announced Wednesday that it was
going to be acquiring cable giant Tele-Communications, Inc. in a
deal valued at close to $48 billion.
</P>
<P>
   For all of the promises of lower costs and increased competition
that accompanied the Telecom Reform Act, in practice it has
translated into little more than carte blanche for Regional Bell
Operating Companies (RBOCs) to merge and for cable operators to
raise their rates.
</P>
<P>
   The fundamental problem that telecom reform has always
confronted has been the so-called ``last mile'' problem. While
long-distance carriers like AT&AMP;T or Sprint can offer lower rates or
connections that provide for the transmission of data and voice
simultaneously, access to consumers has been, for the most part,
controlled by the RBOCs, since they own the lines that enter our
houses. Small competitors like Teleport and RCN have sprung up in
many regions, but they too have been forced either to purchase
access from the RBOCs or build their own local networks, which
entails enormous sunk costs and requires zoning permission that is
often hard to come by. The RBOCs, meanwhile, have done an excellent
job of making it as difficult as possible for consumers to switch
local carriers.
</P>
<P>
   What TCI offers AT&AMP;T, then, is that crucial wire into the home.
I have pointed to the patience company chairman John Malone
exhibited through three years (1995-1997) when the cable industry
looked to be on its way out. Malone always recognized the long-term
leverage that TCI's network of coaxial cable gave the company, and
the AT&AMP;T deal represents the culmination of his long quest to turn
TCI into an all-purpose information carrier.
</P>
<P>
   If Malone and AT&AMP;T chairman Mike Armstrong are to be believed,
AT&AMP;T will now become the Citigroup of the telecom industry,
offering its users one-stop shopping for everything from digital
telephony to cable TV to high-speed Internet service. Malone, in
his inimitable fashion, even suggested that users would be able to
order Viagra while watching their ``favorite entertainment'' (wink,
wink) with a simple point-and-click.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, on yet another big day for stocks, the market's
verdict on the deal was decidedly negative, with AT&AMP;T finishing
down sharply and TCI's main stock up only a little more than a
point. The deal does merit skepticism. Although initial press
accounts suggested that telephone service over the cable wire would
become an instant reality, in fact it's going to take billions of
dollars and at least a couple of years before AT&AMP;T could become a
serious player in the local phone-service market. In addition, AT&AMP;T
is paying a premium for TCI stock and taking on $16 billion in
debt, so it's going to need a huge increase in cash flow in order
to garner an acceptable return on capital.
</P>
<P>
   Still, AT&AMP;T's future was looking increasingly bleak. Its profit
margins were dropping, its sales were standing still, and it really
had no clear plan that would allow it to circumvent the RBOC
stranglehold on consumers. Aside from the managerial and cultural
difficulties created by any huge acquisition, the technological
questions involved in one-stop telecom service are not easy to
solve. But getting access to that last mile does materially change
AT&AMP;T's business. In the long run, this might actually be a merger
that makes sense.

 MANNING THE HOSPITAL BARRICADES  
 By ATUL GAWANDE 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you walk into the cafeteria at my hospital--or, I suspect, at
any other academic medical center--you'll find a medical Bosnia. We
surgical residents sit at one end of the cafeteria, the medical
residents--or ``meddies,'' as we call them--at the other. God knows
where the psychiatrists sit. In the hundreds of meals I've eaten
there over the last three years, I don't think I've sat down with
the meddies more than half a dozen times.
</P>
<P>
   I remember one such time, when the surgery table was full.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mind if I sit here?'' I asked. The pack of meddies eyed me in
my green scrubs suspiciously. Someone grunted, ``OK,'' and cleared
a corner of the table for me. It was my own little Bantustan. The
pack ignored me and resumed a boring conversation comparing how
many ``hits''--patient admissions--each had and how little sleep
each was functioning on. Among surgeons, it's a point of pride
verging on arrogance that we work harder than anybody else. So I
ate my meal silently, looking faintly bemused at their complaints.
Who wanted to talk with those do-nothing, pill-pushing, pointy
heads anyway?
</P>
<P>
   Later I took my share of ribbing from fellow residents for
``going meddie'' at dinner. Next thing you know, someone said,
you'll be wearing a dog collar. Meddies, you see, wear their
stethoscopes around their necks. Surgeons, should we need anything
besides our bare hands, keep our stethoscopes coiled up in a pocket
of our white coats like forgotten but occasionally necessary
detritus. Like admitting you're tired, being caught wearing a dog
collar is embarrassing. It diminishes you.
</P>
<P>
   This all seems childish, I know. Why all this sniping along the
medical front? These are educated, professional people, right? If
you pushed surgeons to explain, I suspect the response would be
that the animosity is functional, that patients would not want
surgeons accepting other specialties' softer values.
</P>
<P>
   Because surgery is so violent, surgeons generally do not
undertake it unless they expect to succeed. So surgical training
inculcates the view that nothing must be allowed to go wrong. One
learns to take responsibility for almost any unwanted
``surprise''--not just death but an unexpected infection, a
dressing applied carelessly, anything.
</P>
<P>
   Once, I had a patient who refused to get out of bed after
surgery and soon developed a clot in his leg. Medical residents
might have thrown up their hands and said, ``What could we do?''
But the chief resident gave me hell for it. It didn't matter that
the patient wouldn't cooperate. Why, she asked, didn't I figure out
a way to make the patient cooperate?
</P>
<P>
   As the argument goes, surgical residents quite naturally
disparage specialties with less rigid--dare I say less
virtuous--priorities, because our values are central to what we do.
So we seldom gripe about cardiologists, because they share our
ethic of personal responsibility and keep our long hours. But
pimple poppers (dermatologists)? Forget it. Here's a joke we tell:
How do you keep a dollar bill from a radiologist? Pin it to a
patient.
</P>
<P>
   This theory of discrimination's functionality doesn't quite add
up, though. Why not simply accept that our group has a certain set
of skills and values that fit our needs, while others have theirs?
If we were sensible about it, we shouldn't need to beat the meddies
down.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out, however, that to social psychologists there is
nothing at all surprising about this antagonism. In numerous
studies, they have documented a deep paradox about human
relations--persons get along, but people don't. Encounters among
individuals are generally positive, supportive, and rewarding, but
those among groups are ordinarily unpleasant and confrontational.
What's more, they observe something called ``the minimal group
effect.'' Even if people are randomly divided into groups, the
groups will automatically discriminate against each other. It seems
we can't help ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   A friend recently put me on to a classic demonstration of the
phenomenon--the Robbers Cave study. In 1954, some experimental
psychologists randomly divided 24 sixth-grade boys into two groups
and took them to Robbers Cave State Park, Okla., for summer camp.
Initially, the two groups were kept apart and unaware of each
other. Almost instantly, kids in each group formed bonds of loyalty
and group identification.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when the groups learned of one another's existence, the
boys immediately drew lines in the sand. They spoke of ``our guys''
and ``those guys.'' Each group named itself--one the Eagles and the
other the Rattlers. Name-calling began at their first interaction.
For example, the Eagles called the Rattlers the ``nigger campers,''
even though all the boys were white. At common meals they glowered
from separate tables. Cabin raids and fistfights ensued.
</P>
<P>
   People discriminate even when it's against their own
self-interest. In a 1970 study, teen-age boys were asked their
preferences among paintings by two ``foreign painters.'' Afterward,
the boys were told that their choices divided them into a ``Klee
group'' and a ``Kandinsky group.'' In fact, they were assigned to
these groups at random. Then, each boy was taken aside and asked
how he would divide up rewards among individual boys from ``your
group'' and ``the other group.''
</P>
<P>
   The results were depressingly consistent. The boys gave more
money to those in their own group. Furthermore, when the options
were fixed so that a boy could not give his group more without
sacrificing profits for both groups, the boys still chose to
maximize the difference in rewards between groups. Although they
knew each other from school; although their groups were defined by
flimsy, irrelevant criteria; and although self-interest was not
served; they discriminated faithfully.
</P>
<P>
   In an influential 1995 paper, the social psychologists Roy
Baumeister and Mark Leary reviewed all such studies and concluded
that we have an instinctive ``need to belong.'' Given the
advantages that would have come to our ancestors from banding
together in groups, this is plausible. Might prejudice--the hatred
between the Rattlers and the Eagles, the Klees depriving the
Kandinskys, the surgical residents' disdain for meddies--be
instinctive too? I spoke with Leary, and he wasn't ready to go that
far.
</P>
<P>
   Given the pessimistic findings, however, we might ask why groups
aren't always at war with one another. Fortunately, it turns out
that despite how easily group hostility forms, it's not that hard
to damp it down. Sociologists have documented many methods--for
example, fomenting competition within a group, even moral suasion.
</P>
<P>
   At Robbers Cave, animosity rapidly disappeared when the
``counselors'' created common tasks, for example, fixing a broken
water tank. Also, these experiments--like residency--artificially
isolate individuals from families, outside friends, and other
social ties that produce bonds outside group lines.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one of the difficulties I have keeping up my aversion
to meddies is that I'm friends with a few from my medical school
class. (Why can't other meddies be like you? I ask them.) It seems
that given the chance, we are legions ready to mass against one
another. Fortunately, we keep getting distracted.

 A TALE OF TWO CHAIRS  
 By ALEXANDER CHANCELLOR 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When, in the early 1940s, my grandmother set about refurbishing
Shieldhill, a reacquired ancestral home in Scotland, she called
upon her friend Dolly Mann, a fashionable London interior decorator
with a shop in Mayfair. And in this shop were two chairs of an
unusual and beguiling character.
</P>
<P>
   They had all the formality and grandeur my grandmother could
desire, but there was also much charm in the gilt decoration of
their wooden frames. They had rams' hooves for feet and rams' heads
on their front corners, and lots of leaves and flowers between. My
grandmother took them up to Shieldhill and placed them on each side
of the drawing-room chimney piece. We don't know how much she paid,
for both she and Mann are long dead, and Mann's shop and its
records were demolished by one of Hitler's bombs. But my uncle
Robin Chancellor believes she bought them for something like 50
pounds each. He does not believe his mother knew or cared about
their provenance.
</P>
<P>
   The chairs ultimately found their way to Robin's
Northamptonshire home, where they remained for another 35 years,
during which time my childless uncle generously made me a gift of
his property and, he believed, its contents. So the chairs were
thought to be mine when a country neighbor, James Miller, dropped
in for tea last June and looked longingly upon them. Miller, a vice
president of the London auction house Sotheby's, thought they might
be extremely valuable. Might he return with a furniture expert from
Sotheby's?
</P>
<P>
   When Miller returned with Joseph Friedman, head of Sotheby's
furniture department, he told Robin, ``If they are what we think,
they could be worth a king's ransom,'' perhaps between 300,000 and
500,000 pounds. Miller asked if they could take a chair to London
for closer examination, and Uncle Robin (and I when he consulted
me) readily agreed.
</P>
<P>
   We waited impatiently for the Sotheby's verdict. Money was
urgently needed for all kinds of purposes, and my confidence that I
would win the national lottery was waning. At the request of
Sotheby's, the second chair was dispatched to London. Friedman kept
in touch, declaring mounting optimism about the chairs' value, but
there always seemed to be some further test to be made or expert
advice to be sought.
</P>
<P>
   Their aim was to authenticate the chairs as belonging to a
famous suite of 18th century furniture designed by the architect
Robert Adam for the chief merchant-adventurer of his day, Sir
Lawrence Dundas (``The Nabob of the North''). Dundas had
commissioned the suite to adorn his stately home, Moor Park in
Hertfordshire (now a golf clubhouse). The furniture was made by a
little-known cabinetmaker--James Lawson--whose invoice of 1764
survives. Lawson charged Dundas a total of 122 pounds 5 shillings
for two sofas, six chairs and two stools, making the sale one of
the most expensive recorded in England in that century.
</P>
<P>
   While Sotheby's was beavering away, its rival Christie's carried
out a spectacular sale of two other Adam chairs commissioned in
1765 by Dundas for his London house. The two gilt and red damask
chairs sold for the incredible sum of 1,706,500 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   I began to see my chairs not just as a solution to pressing
financial problems but also as a means of transforming my entire
way of life.
</P>
<P>
   But my euphoria was premature. There was a world of difference
between the ``Dundas Chairs'' sold at Christie's and mine. They had
been manufactured by the legendary Thomas Chippendale and were
opulent-looking chairs on which any fat, ignorant, cigar-smoking
billionaire would have contentedly rested his bottom. By contrast,
the ``Moor Park Chairs'' were, in one expert's words, ``awkward''
and ``lacking in sex appeal.'' And then, of course, the
authenticity of my chairs had still to be established. At the end
of July, just as I was about to set off for a holiday in Italy, I
got a message from Friedman. He was tremendously optimistic but
needed to take the chairs up to Kenwood House in Hampstead, a
property administered by English Heritage, to compare them in
detail with authenticated Moor Park chairs there.
</P>
<P>
   At my first holiday stop, among the other guests was Desmond
Fitz-Gerald, who represents Christie's in Ireland. When I produced
some photographs of my granddaughters, he was less interested in
them than in the chair on which they happened to be besporting
themselves. Did I realize what an important chair this was? I said
I did, and that its pair was currently at Sotheby's. Fitz-Gerald
then made it his holiday mission to wrest the chairs away from
Sotheby's and into the hands of Christie's. He told me that
nowadays anyone with something valuable to sell would invite
proposals from competing auction houses. I told him I was committed
to Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Fitz-Gerald telephoned to press his case. But
only a few minutes earlier I had received a telephone call from
Robin, who said that Sotheby's had rung to tell him regretfully
that they now believed our chairs were copies of the Moor Park
originals, with a value of perhaps 20,000 pounds. I told
Fitz-Gerald this disappointing news. Still, he said, since the
chairs were in London, Christie's might like to take a look at
them. Soon afterward I got a call from Orlando Rock of Christie's
furniture department, who arranged to have the chairs taken to
Christie's.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks later, Rock telephoned me to say his investigation
of the chairs was complete, and ``I am completely certain that the
chairs are 'right.''' They had been taken to pieces, and the
webbing was right, the tufting was right, and under the top layer
of cheap modern gilt paint lurked a layer of authentic 18th century
oil gilt. Christie's would like to auction the chairs as the star
attraction of its sale of Important English Furniture on Nov. 13.
</P>
<P>
   There was, however, less-good news. The sale might be difficult
because of the conclusion reached by Sotheby's that the chairs were
copies. Negative ``back chat'' could deter some potential bidders.
So, Christie's recommended a cautious reserve price of 150,000
pounds that they might raise to 200,000 if we insisted.
</P>
<P>
   For the childish reason that 200,000 pounds is more than
150,000, we chose the former and waited excitedly for the sale. Two
days beforehand I received a call from an agitated Rock. The
dreaded ``back chat'' had broken out. The Sunday Telegraph's arts
reporter, Catherine Milner, had been telephoning London's top
furniture dealers suggesting that the Moor Park chair on the cover
of Christie's lavish catalog was a later copy. He had been unable
to convince Milner that the chairs were ``right.'' She said she
wasn't going to publish an article on the subject because she
hadn't enough evidence, but he feared she had done sufficient
damage to threaten the auction.
</P>
<P>
   When I called Milner--a former colleague whom I knew and
liked--she told me that unnamed furniture experts had told her the
chairs looked fishy. The chairs' decorations differed from those in
a published design for a Moor Park stool, and the construction
differed from that of an authenticated one at Kenwood House.
</P>
<P>
   My conversation with Milner took place on the eve of the sale,
and there was no time to investigate these claims. By the time I
went to bed I had learned from Rock that of half a dozen people who
had earlier expressed an interest, only one was now expected to bid
for the chairs--a collector in Los Angeles. But next morning, he
too pulled out and, at the auction, the chairs failed to reach
their compromise reserve price of 180,000 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   We were certainly much disappointed, but before the day was out,
Rock's boss, Robert Copley, called to say seven people had
approached Christie's since that morning to say they were
interested. He proposed conducting an informal telephone auction
among them. After several days Copley called to say the highest bid
was 180,000 pounds. We accepted it at once. Christie's wouldn't
identify the buyer, but they said he was a British collector who
planned to restore the chairs to their original condition. Whoever
he is, I would like to thank him here for making out his check with
such exemplary promptness.
</P>
<P>
   So the sale finally achieved a satisfactory outcome. When the
chairs had failed at auction, however, I had telephoned Robert
Holden, an independent fine art agent who had shepherded the Dundas
chairs to their triumphant Christie's sale. He was certain of our
chairs' authenticity and outraged by what had happened to them.
Holden's advice is that anyone with anything important to auction
on the art market should first seek the help of an independent
consultant. One would expect him to say that, but my experience
with the Moor Park chairs suggests that he may have a point.
</P>
<P>
   I see I'm calling them the Moor Park chairs again, but what of
all the doubts about their authenticity? Sotheby's Friedman still
maintains they are copies. An early enthusiast, he says he changed
his mind upon seeing one of ours next to one of the authenticated
Kenwood ones. Ours was different in construction and much inferior
in quality.
</P>
<P>
   Julius Bryant, director of collections at English Heritage, says
he has no doubt the chairs are of 18th century construction but
doesn't feel able to state categorically that they were part of the
original Moor Park set. But if they weren't, what could they have
been? Rock maintains there is no shred of evidence to suggest that
suite was extended later in the century.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's colleague Treve Rosoman, an English Heritage curator
and furniture historian who was present at the visits of both
Sotheby's and Christie's to Kenwood, says that after their side
upholstery had been peeled off, he, by contrast, became certain the
chairs were ``absolutely right.''
</P>
<P>
   Christie's Rock says he genuinely believes Milner's calls to
dealers ``effectively ruined the sale.'' But it seems strange that
a body of experts in such a specialized field should be put to rout
by a few inquiries from a journalist claiming no expertise at all.
If Rock is correct, the art market is as vulnerable to unwarranted
crises of confidence as the market in foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Still, my Uncle Robin and I are very happy, for 180,000 pounds
still seems to us an awful lot of money. As for you, dear readers,
do not forget that one stool and one chair from the original Moor
Park suite are still out there somewhere, unaccounted for. If you
happen to own either of them and wish to sell it, I hope you will
now be a little better prepared to judge how best to proceed.

 LIGHT AND DARK  
 By BRENT STAPLES 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Martin Luther King was beatified because he died dramatically
with his sins unknown and the civil rights movement still seen as
an epic gathering of heroes. Hero worship dominated the story from
the Montgomery bus boycott in the 1950s through the Reaganaut '80s,
when writers finally began to acknowledge that the civil rights
establishment had just as many fakers as saints.
</P>
<P>
   The inner workings of King's organization have yet to be fully
revealed. But enough has been said to show that the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference was a cult of personality in which
King's lieutenants covered up his sexual peccadilloes and vied
obscenely for his attention and the chance to succeed him in the
public eye.
</P>
<P>
   The tale of the selfless prophets is giving way to a more
realistic but no less amazing story of how egoists, hustlers and
sensualists rose above their failings to remake the United States.
In his memoir, ``Walking With the Wind,'' Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga.,
pushes this new openness a good deal further. He speaks bluntly
about the movement's faults--and his own--during his leadership of
the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   SNCC was SCLC's chief competitor and the principal operator in
the dangerous voting rights campaigns in Mississippi and Alabama.
Lewis respected his civil rights forefathers but did not worship
them. A decade younger than King and substantially more aggressive,
he regularly dismissed the advice of bigwigs like King and the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's Roy
Wilkins and Thurgood Marshall, pursuing a course far more radical
than theirs in the deep South.
</P>
<P>
   But what is freshest about ``Walking With the Wind'' is that
Lewis is equally candid about the class conflicts that afflicted
the modern civil rights movements from the very beginning. Tensions
between the uneducated rural poor and the urban intellectuals were
glaringly obvious to African-Americans, but largely invisible to
the white press and the historians who succeeded them.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years is less than the blink of an eye in human history.
Yet it was that recently that black people in Alabama or
Mississippi were arrested, beaten, fired from their jobs and even
lynched for trying to vote. The campaign that overturned American
apartheid was a potent form of theater, in which demonstrators
embraced the opportunity to be shot, gassed and thrashed in order
to generate outrage against Southern racism.
</P>
<P>
   The most harrowing parts of this book tell of Lewis and the
integrated teams of Freedom Riders who rode on buses through the
South to test federal laws that forbade segregation in interstate
transport. One bus was firebombed in Anniston, Ala. The bus was
surrounded by a mob that had lynching on its mind until an
undercover policeman got off the bus brandishing his pistol.
</P>
<P>
   A Freedom Riders bus carrying Lewis had the unfortunate
experience of arriving in Montgomery, Ala. The mob that came to
savage them bore a striking resemblance to the flesh-eating zombies
in the cult movie ``Night of the Living Dead'':
</P>
<P>
   ``And then, out of nowhere, from every direction, came people.
White people. Men, women and children. Dozens of them. Hundreds of
them. Out of alleys, out of side streets, around the corners of
office buildings. ... They carried every makeshift weapon
imaginable. Baseball bats, wooden boards, bricks, chains, tire
irons, pipes, even garden tools--hoes and rakes. One group had a
woman in front, their faces twisted in anger, screaming, `Git them
niggers, GIT them niggers.' ... And now they turned to us, this sea
of people, more than three hundred of them, shouting and screaming,
men swinging fists and weapons, women swinging heavy purses, little
children clawing with their fingernails at the faces of anyone they
could reach. ... I could see Jim Zwerg now, being horribly beaten.
Someone picked up his suitcase, which he had dropped, and swung it
full force against his head. Another man lifted Jim's head and held
it ... while others, including women and children, scratched at
Jim's face. His eyes were shut. He was unconscious. ... At that
instant I felt a thud against my head. I could feel my knees
collapse and then nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   SNCC pioneered the strategy of trading fractured skulls for
press attention and moral outrage. This seems coldblooded--until
the reader considers that Lewis thrust himself into the most
dangerous confrontations. Lewis' admirers called it bravery. Lewis
called it ``redemptive suffering,'' a concept he picked up from
studying Gandhi, among others. But what it amounted to was putting
yourself forward to be beaten, possibly to death, day after day,
week after week, month after month. What would drive someone to do
this is still an enigma to me.
</P>
<P>
   The method succeeded to perfection when Alabama state troopers
bludgeoned and tear-gassed the Selma march led by Lewis in 1965.
King had skipped the march, fearful of the violence. But ``Bloody
Sunday'' at Selma outraged the nation and gave President Lyndon
Johnson cover to press for the Voting Rights Act.
</P>
<P>
   Wildly successful, the Selma campaign nonetheless marked the
beginning of the end for the movement. The civil rights coalition
was tearing itself apart in disputes over tactics, money and who
would get the most exposure in the press.
</P>
<P>
   Egos were clearly at issue. But so were the antagonisms that had
long separated middle- and upper-class blacks from their
sharecropper cousins. A blatant elitism infested the movement for
racial uplift from the outset. The first civil rights leaders were
from the mulatto elite, which historically discriminated against
darker-skinned blacks and held many of the same ideas about them
that whites did.
</P>
<P>
   These antipathies mellowed into condescension in W.E.B. Du Bois,
a scion of the fair-skinned elite, a co-founder of the NAACP, and
the first black man to earn a Ph.D. from Harvard. Du Bois' racial
philosophy emerged in his essay on ``the talented tenth,'' assigned
the task of lifting up the rest. Du Bois wrote, ``Progress in human
affairs is more often a pull than a push, a surging forward of the
exceptional man, and the lifting of his duller brethren slowly and
painfully to his vantage-ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis had lots of experience with snobbery from high-toned
Negroes. The NAACP in particular was chock full of fair-skinned
members of the black middle class. Lewis, by contrast, was
darker-skinned and had been raised in poor, rural Alabama. His
accent and modest, even diffident, manner led the Negro leaders to
view him as much less than he was.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis describes the civil rights elite as bourgeois folks who
enjoyed fund-raisers but had never known the billy club and
``tended to look down through a telescope at the little people.''
Meeting with Wilkins to plan the March on Washington in 1963, Lewis
found himself being treated like a hick.
</P>
<P>
   The most complex tensions were between Lewis and his close
colleague Julian Bond, whose father was a pillar of Atlanta's Negro
elite and a close friend of Du Bois'. Bond must have found it
satisfying to be accepted by a black person who had been raised
hard--and who was not from the affluent set.
</P>
<P>
   The official line is that Lewis and Bond were fast friends when
they were in SNCC together but fell out in 1986, when they both ran
for the same congressional seat. ``Walking With the Wind'' tells a
different story. Lewis hints at secret annoyance with Bond from the
first mention, in which he writes that Julian was ``like most of
the Atlanta members, more upper crust than those of us from
Nashville.'' Lewis portrays SNCC's Atlanta branch as being made up
of well-off Negroes who carped all the time.
</P>
<P>
   The split seemed to come in 1969, when Julian Bond was elected
to the Georgia state Legislature and became the darling of the
American left's radical chic set. Lewis advised Bond to stay at
home in Atlanta, build a political machine and run for Congress.
Bond rejected this advice. But a quarter of a century later, the
two faced off in a bitter campaign for the Fifth Congressional
District seat. Andrew Young, Maynard Jackson and the mulatto elite
dismissed Lewis and lined up behind Bond.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the book, Lewis remarks bitterly on press coverage that
referred to Bond as ``light-skinned, dashing, erudite, articulate''
and to Lewis as ``short, squat, thick-necked, balding, dark,
scowling, a sharecropper's son.'' Influential blacks from around
the country advised him to quit the race and leave the seat to the
man many of them viewed as its rightful heir. Still angry, Lewis
writes, ``Throughout my years in the movement ... people had always
underestimated me ... often in the end to their dismay.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis brought to the campaign the same intensity he had trained
upon redneck troopers and sheriffs. When he defeated Bond, it was
more than just a victory for himself. It was a victory for the
dark-skinned, dirt poor masses against the hincty Negroes who had
historically looked down on them.

YES, VIRGIL, THERE WERE COMPOSERS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Joseph Horowitz teaches at the New England Conservatory, where he
will direct a weeklong festival exploring the music of Chadwick and
other turn-of-the-century Americans next March.  
 By JOSEPH HOROWITZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A venerable article of faith holds that American concert music
``came of age'' after World War I. Previous American composers, we
are told, were second-rate clones of German teachers. Virgil
Thomson called the music of George Chadwick, Edward MacDowell, John
Knowles Paine, Amy Beach and other prominent turn-of-the-century
Americans ``a pale copy'' of ``Continental models'' and reckoned
their scale of achievement ``a sort of adolescence.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Bernstein termed this ``the kindergarten period of
American music,'' whose ``fine, academic imitations'' of European
masters were actually intended to sound like Brahms and Liszt:
``the more they did, the better.''
</P>
<P>
   Only with the waning of modernism does this article of faith
begin to seem a bill of goods: the wholesale rejection of an
American past richly indebted to Germanic culture, science and
scholarship. The act of repudiation was both political and
esthetic.
</P>
<P>
   Its origins included acute Germanophobia occasioned by the Great
War, during which ``Kultur'' became a dirty word, Wagner and
Strauss were banned by certain orchestras and opera companies, and
Karl Muck, the distinguished conductor of the Boston Symphony, was
interned in Georgia as an enemy alien.
</P>
<P>
   In music, the new postwar culture-bearers were modernist
Francophiles, like Thomson and Aaron Copland, who vastly preferred
Stravinsky to Wagner or Brahms. America's Germanic genteel
tradition, with its emphasis on spiritual uplift, seemed musty and
vague, anything but ``American.'' In no European nation was the
continuity of musical culture fractured by a schism of such
magnitude.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein, whose various scenarios of American musical
accomplishment typically denied the existence of an American school
before the advent of jazz in the 1920s, was never able to account
for the genius of Charles Ives, who, no less than his genteel Yale
mentors, espoused Beethoven and Brahms, ennoblement and uplift. If
Ives' First Symphony, completed in 1898, is a maverick excursion,
it is an excursion within genteel terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was Ives the first genteel composer whose music sounded
``American.'' A steady stream of recordings of the music of George
Whitefield Chadwick should suffice to convince any sympathetic
listener that his was a voice both genteel and _ pace Thomson and
Bernstein _ unmistakably American.
</P>
<P>
   It was Chadwick's own opinion that he found his voice with an
Allegretto scherzando that became the second movement of his Second
Symphony. At its premiere, in 1884, this six-minute scherzo proved
the first music to be encored by the Boston Symphony, and Julius
Hegyi's recording with the Albany Symphony on New World shows why.
</P>
<P>
   A model of ingenious construction and melodic invention, it even
makes the orchestra giggle and guffaw. The breeziness of its humor
is a Chadwick trademark.
</P>
<P>
   So is the pentatonic flavor of the main tune, steeped in
Anglo-American folk song. The methodology of this music may be
Germanic, but its composer is American.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a new observation. Henry T. Parker, the dean of
Boston's music critics in Chadwick's day, once wrote: ``Chadwick
does not write American music because he was born in Lowell, or
because he lives and works in Boston, or because he now and then
recalls an American folk tune. He writes it because it is often ...
intrinsically American in mood, spirit and appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1854, Chadwick studied at the Leipzig Conservatory,
where he was considered a greater talent than his German
classmates. From 1897 until his death in 1931, he directed the New
England Conservatory in Boston. His music was frequently performed
by the Boston Symphony under such conductors as Arthur Nikisch and
Muck.
</P>
<P>
   This was a great American epoch for symphonic culture:
Chadwick's colleagues included Antonin Dvorak, who, as director of
the National Conservatory in New York, awarded him a prize for his
Third Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Chadwick's lifetime, his most popular work was the concert
overture ``Melpomene'' (1887). The Boston Symphony played it 14
times between 1887 and 1902 (and twice thereafter, in 1921 and
1942). Anton Seidl, Gustav Mahler, Josef Stransky and Henry Hadley
conducted it 11 times with the New York Philharmonic between 1896
and 1921. Theodore Thomas and Frederick Stock performed it a dozen
times with the Chicago Symphony. It was also heard in Copenhagen
and Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by the muse of tragedy, ``Melpomene'' is entertainingly
earnest. But here Chadwick lives up _ or down _ to his reputation:
the opening English-horn solo is almost comically derivative from
the Prelude to ``Tristan und Isolde.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jubilee'' (1895), from the ``Symphonic Sketches,'' more
embodies Chadwick's metier. Its Yankee exuberance and heartwarming
nostalgia evoke something like Mark Twain's America. When this
music isn't busy shouting, it sings lovingly of hearth and home.
The big tune begs for an Oscar Hammerstein lyric. With three
recorded versions currently available, ``Jubilee'' is today
Chadwick's best-known composition, but less familiar than it should
be.
</P>
<P>
   A prime example of ``serious'' Chadwick, eclipsing
``Melpomene,'' is the 35-minute Third Symphony (1894), the one
honored by Dvorak. After the first performance, by the Boston
Symphony under Chadwick's baton, the composer confided in a memoir:
``The orchestra and all the musicians agreed that this was my best
work so far. Of course, it does show the influence of Brahms in
places. ...'' When Chadwick led the symphony in Leipzig in 1905, a
local critic wrote, ``I hold George W. Chadwick to be the most
important living Anglo-American composer _ Edward Elgar not
excepted.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Chadwick Third evokes Brahms, it is a more blithe and
sprightly Brahms than the one we know. The symphony's virtues
include a ravishing slow movement with such magical constructive
touches as Chadwick's way of easing into the recapitulation, with
its big cello tune, through a halo of violins.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the finale's stentorian horn theme and contrapuntal
bustle, this isn't ``victory'' music, a la Beethoven or Brahms; it
is merely happy. (A Polish musician friend for whom I played Neeme
Jarvi's recording thought this movement's ranginess and optimism
suggested ``the great American West.'')
</P>
<P>
   Chadwick's catalog is also rich in vocal and chamber music. Of
his five string quartets (recorded by the Portland Quartet on
Northeastern), the Fourth (1896) was the most popular in his
lifetime. It is a hearty work, echoing with New England hymns and
fiddle tunes yet distinguished by a finale incorporating elements
of passacaglia and fugue. The Chadwick scholar Steven Ledbetter
speculates that Dvorak's ``American'' Quartet, introduced by the
Kneisel Quartet in Boston in 1894, was a likely source of
inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, according to Ledbetter, the two composers influenced
each other during Dvorak's years in America. ``Both were masters of
warmhearted melody and gifted orchestrators; both created themes
that sound like, but are not, folk song.'' And both experienced the
American heartland: Dvorak traveled west to Iowa, where the
``American'' Quartet was born; Chadwick taught in Michigan and
traveled west, to Nebraska and Minnesota, while working on his
Fifth Quartet.
</P>
<P>
   Rediscovering Chadwick can refine our understanding of our
musical past. If so, we will have to overcome stubborn prejudices
about American music in relation to its European parents, and about
19th-century American music in relation to its rebellious
20th-century progeny.

   ``It's a complex thing being an American,'' Henry James once
observed, ``and one of the responsibilities it entails is fighting
against a superstitious valuation of Europe.''

<P>
   Not long ago, a composition student at a leading American
conservatory was invited to sample the Chadwick Third. Asked what
he made of it, the student thought for a time, then volunteered,
``It's better than I thought it would be.''

CHILDREN AND NEW HOUSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Thursday July 2)  
 By MARY J. LOFTUS   Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   My 7-year-old stood by the creek behind the house, spellbound by
the shadows of minnows darting through the shallow water.
</P>
<P>
   I looked up the back yard toward the tan, two-story brick with
dormer windows. The family who lives there now is moving out, and
we will be moving in within the month.
</P>
<P>
   My husband and I took our eldest up for the house closing,
having read that it would ease his anxieties to get a preview of
our new town, choose his room, meet the principal of his new
school.
</P>
<P>
   The first day we drove by the house, Adam wouldn't even look out
the car window.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh-huh, I see it,'' he said, crouched down in the back seat.
</P>
<P>
   But the next day, the day we are to sit in a lawyer's office and
sign form after duplicate form, he quietly tours the house, climbs
the basement stairs, gazes out the windows of the upstairs
bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may choose this room or that one,'' his dad and I say.
</P>
<P>
   We cheerfully point out the downstairs fireplace, the rec room,
the tree-filled yard, the nearby playground and community pool.
</P>
<P>
   We've picked the neighborhood _ a quiet, 25-year-old suburb
northwest of Atlanta _ largely for the school district and the
affordable homes.
</P>
<P>
   The elementary school, Knight Elementary, meets expectations.
It's warm and homey, with shining suits of armor standing at regal
attention in the lobby and live plants on every table in the
lunchroom.
</P>
<P>
   A goldfish named ``Piggy,'' the mascot of the library, splashes
Adam when he looks into her bowl.
</P>
<P>
   When we return to the house, it is rightfully and legally ours.
I begin to have my own anxieties.
</P>
<P>
   Who's going to mow the lawn, water the grass, collect the mail
while we're 500 miles away wrapping up our other lives? Why didn't
I notice this atrocious pineapple wallpaper in the kitchen before?
What can we do to the kitchen deck to make sure our 2-year-old
doesn't tumble off it?
</P>
<P>
   I try to memorize the house number, to mentally retrace the way
to the elementary school, to choose a color to repaint the upstairs
bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   I try, also, to envision our life replanted here.
</P>
<P>
   How this residential street and mail box and school newsletter
and bus schedule will soon become our daily reality.
</P>
<P>
   Then I walk back down the back yard _ our back yard _ to where
Adam has wandered back to the creek. He's throwing stones in the
water, disrupting the minnows, stirring up the silt.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, we've arranged to meet with friends who live
here and who, best of all, have an 8-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   He and Adam will have a great time splashing in the motel pool,
playing chicken on their dads' shoulders, watching the Bulls play
the Jazz for the championship.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, we sit and watch the muddy water, waiting for it to
settle.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what do you think of the house?'' I ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nice,'' he says, shrugging.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want to go back in one more time before we leave?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope,'' Adam says, throwing another rock.
</P>
<P>
   He's probably right. There will be plenty of time for that
later.
</P>
<P>

   Even if you haven't seen ``The Truman Show'' _ and you should,
it's an oddly beautiful and intricately multi-layered fantasy _ you
probably know the trick of the movie is that Jim Carrey's whole
life is an orchestrated TV show taking place inside a gigantic
studio masquerading as a Florida seacoast town, with Carrey the
only one in the world who's not in on the secret.
</P>
<P>
   It's Voyeur TV.
</P>
<P>
   The main character's name is Truman Burbank. He's a true man,
get it? As for the surname, ``beautiful downtown Burbank,'' as
Johnny Carson used to call it, is home to countless TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   Logic tells us nothing like ``The Truman Show'' could happen in
the real world _ that Truman Burbank would never make it to age 30
without figuring out he's living inside television. And the second
he realized it was all a charade, he'd demand to be released from
the studio-prison.
</P>
<P>
   Or would he? One of the alternate endings considered for ``The
Truman Show'' had the hero opting to remain inside the blissful
biosphere, where the days were sunny and bright and the people were
kind and considerate, and his own disposition was so optimistic and
worry-free he greeted the neighbors each day with: ``Good morning!
And if I don't see you, good afternoon, good evening and good
night!''
</P>
<P>
   Why give up a comforting bubble for the frightening unknown?
</P>
<P>
   As it is, there's a growing subculture of people who are living
in a kind of ``Truman Show'' of their own making _ the key
difference being that these human beings are volunteering to live
in a video fishbowl.
</P>
<P>
   On June 16, a woman Elizabeth gave birth while her husband, her
three children, a cameraman, a producer, a play-by-play announcer
and an online audience looked on. The event was billed as the
world's first Internet delivery, and viewers caused an online
traffic jam in their rush to have a virtual front-row seat in the
delivery room.
</P>
<P>
   Most amusing to me was that Elizabeth, 40, didn't want the media
to use her last name. Privacy concerns, don't you know.
</P>
<P>
   That's also the practice on ``The Real World,'' the long-running
``documentary'' on MTV in which seven young people, selected from
thousands of auditioning hopefuls, live together for three months
while film crews record their every waking moments _ outside of the
bathroom and bedroom, that is.
</P>
<P>
   This year's edition was filmed in Seattle. They've already done
New York, L.A., San Francisco, London, Miami and Boston. Sooner or
later they're going to come to Chicago, whether we want them to or
not.
</P>
<P>
   They never use last names on ``The Real World,'' either. They
have, however, shown a young woman named Tami as she went through
an abortion and also had her jaws wired shut in a sad effort to
lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   These women are saying: Film me as I deliver a child, record me
as I battle an eating disorder and go through an abortion _ but no
last names, please!
</P>
<P>
   Interesting where some people draw the line.
</P>
<P>
   Starring in their own personal ``Truman Show'' adventures _
though once again it's the subjects, and not some unseen
megalomaniacal artiste, who are initiating the filming process _
are the hundreds of ``personal cam'' and ``live cam'' websites
popping up all over the Internet. All you have to do is click on
these sites and you can watch real-time photos or in some cases
videos of people living their lives in stultifying detail.
</P>
<P>
   There's a guy in New England who has a camera looking out his
window at his backyard, all time.
</P>
<P>
   Another man in Las Vegas keeps a camera focused on himself as he
works all day. He types, he drinks coffee, he taps away at his
computer, he answers the phone.
</P>
<P>
   A young woman in downstate Illinois keeps a camera in her
bedroom _ but don't get any ideas, the footage is strictly G-rated.
</P>
<P>
   Several college students have set up dorm cams. Watch 'em drink!
See 'em study! Wait for Friday night and see if the boyfriend gets
to stay over!
</P>
<P>
   The most famous personal cam website is operated by a
21-year-old woman named Jennifer (http://www.jennicam.org), who has
been featured in numerous magazine and newspaper articles,
discussing the ``jennicam'' way of life.
</P>
<P>
   Each day hundreds of visitors to the website can view
continually-updated images of Jennifer combing her hair, Jennifer
talking on the phone, Jennifer kissing her boyfriend, Jennifer
eating dinner, Jennifer taking a nap, and yes, Jennifer taking off
her clothes in a very non-sexual kind of way.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not about Peeping Tomism, it's much deeper and weirder
than even that. Jennifer is a New Age exhibitionist who delights in
sharing her world, all of it, with thousands of strangers. She is
the spiritual godchild of Andy Warhol; she likes to be watched, all
the time.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the wannabe-stars on ``The Real World,'' Jennifer seems
completely oblivious of the camera _ yet we know that's not true.
The camera is the center of her being. As a child of the multimedia
age, Jennifer seems to believe her very ordinary life will somehow
take on greater importance and weight if it's broadcast on the
Internet, and as long as people keep visiting her website, how can
we tell her she's sadly mistaken?

 &HT;    COURT UPHOLDS RESTRICTIONS ON ARTS FUNDING
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Creating fears for free speech advocates, the
Supreme Court ruled 8-1 on Thursday that the government can deny
federal funding to artists whose works are deemed indecent.
</P>
<P>
   The decision will have a ``chilling effect'' on controversial
artists who would otherwise seek grants from the National Endowment
for the Arts for projects outside the mainstream, predicted Majorie
Heins, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   But the ruling was hailed by critics of the federal arts agency
who have objected to taxpayer funding of works such as Andres
Serrano's depiction of a crucifix immersed in urine and the late
Robert Mapplethorpe's homoerotic photographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the government is in the arts business, it has every right
to call the tune,'' said Robert Knight, cultural director of the
Family Research Council, a conservative advocacy group. ``No
individual has a right to be granted tax dollars with no strings
attached.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the court, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said the
First Amendment guarantee of free speech does not preclude Congress
from requiring the NEA to consider general standards of decency, as
well as artistic excellence, in allocating its funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any content-based considerations that may be taken into
account in the grant-making process are a consequence of the nature
of arts funding,'' O'Connor wrote. ``The NEA has limited resources
and it must deny the majority of the grant applications that it
receives....
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the First Amendment certainly has application in the
subsidy context, we note that the government may allocate
competitive funding according to criteria that would be
impermissible were direct regulation of speech or a criminal
penalty at stake. So long as legislation does not infringe on other
constitutionally protected rights, Congress has wide latitude to
set spending priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Compromising as conservatives sought to abolish the NEA,
Congress established the decency rule in 1990. The law directs the
NEA to take ``into consideration general standards of decency and
respect for the diverse beliefs and values of the American public''
in making its grants.
</P>
<P>
   However, it was quickly challenged by several performance
artists, including Karen Finley, known for expressing feminist
outrage by smearing her nude body with chocolate. Lower courts
struck down the statute, declaring it unconstitutionally vague and
a violation of artists ' rights of free expression.
</P>
<P>
   Overturning that decision, the Supreme Court concluded that the
law ``is facially valid, as it neither inherently interferes with
First Amendment rights nor violates constitutional vagueness
principles.''
</P>
<P>
   While conceding disappointment in the ruling, civil libertarians
were not devastated by the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have been worse,'' said Heins, the ACLU attorney.
``Basically, they upheld the law by saying it is meaningless.''
</P>
<P>
   That was also the reading of David Cole, a Georgetown law
professor who represented Finley and the other artists who took the
case to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority opinion accepted our theory that the First
Amendment applies when the government distributes money to the
arts,'' said Cole. ``They just interpreted this statute as not
being in violation'' because it instructs the NEA to consider the
decency standards but does not issue edicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where the court went wrong is failing to recognize the
real-world effect'' of the statute -- which has been to stop
funding of controversial projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cole said his reading was bolstered by a concurring opinion
written by Justice Antonin Scalia and endorsed by Justice Clarence
Thomas. They said the majority had upheld the law ``by gutting it''
in their interpretation. O'Connor was joined in full by Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices John Paul Stevens,
Anthony M. Kennedy and Stephen G. Breyer, and in part by Justice
Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Justice David H. Souter dissented, saying the law should be
struck down because it was ``overbroad and carries with it a
significant power to chill artistic production and display.''
</P>
<P>
   But the court rejected the notion that the statute was too broad
or vague.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the context of selective subsidies, it is not always
feasible for Congress to legislate with clarity,'' wrote O'Connor.
``Indeed, if this statute is unconstitutionally vague, then so too
are all government programs awarding scholarships and grants on the
basis of subjective criteria such as 'excellence.'''
</P>
<P>
   Imposing the decency standards did not end the jeopardy for the
NEA, which was established in 1965 and has been opposed from the
start by some critics who believe taxes should not support the arts
at all. The agency's budget has been reduced in recent years. The
full House is expected to vote soon on the issue. Last year, the
House voted to abolish the agency but the Senate saved it during
conference negotiations.

<TEXT>
<P>
   To visit Pennsylvania's Amish country is to drive 150 miles from
New York City and feel like an outsider in your own land. I have
lived in New Delhi and Tokyo, but I felt almost as foreign in Bird
in Hand and Intercourse, two villages at the historic center of the
Amish settlement, where my family and I spent a recent weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Although I found much to love in the area _ the honest food, the
impressive quilts, the plain, verdant esthetic _ there were
uncomfortable moments over the two days.
</P>
<P>
   When my husband asked our Amish buggy driver about the attitude
of the traditional Old Order Amish toward the more modern groups,
the driver sternly replied: ``There aren't any attitudes. The Bible
tells us not to judge others.''
</P>
<P>
   A sign at Hannah Stoltzfoos Quilts &AMP; Handmades warned, ``No
photographs, no tourists beyond this gate.''
</P>
<P>
   In a museum slide documentary, an Amish farmer recounted how a
tourist once asked him, ``Hey, are you for real?'' The farmer,
disdainful, replied: ``No, we're the fake ones. The real ones live
down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   The Amish clearly have a complicated relationship with the
tourists who make their roads impassable in summer yet spend $400
million a year in Lancaster County, much of it on Amish-made
products. As Dr. Donald B. Kraybill writes in ``The Riddle of Amish
Culture'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1989), one of the best
books on the community, ``To discard the buggy, for instance, would
not only break Amish tradition but also shatter powerful
expectations placed upon them by the outside world.'' In this way,
Kraybill says, tourism may be inadvertently strengthening, not
diluting, Amish life.
</P>
<P>
   The Amish of Lancaster County are, after all, thriving; they
numbered around 1,000 at the turn of the century, compared with
22,000 today.
</P>
<P>
   So there is more than ever to see, and to stew about. How can
you understand a culture whose essence is not letting outsiders in?
</P>
<P>
   Our weekend began in Times Square late on a Friday afternoon.
The four of us _ my husband and me and our children, Madeleine, 8,
and Teddy, 4 _ drove for three and a half hours, then checked into
the Village Inn of Bird in Hand, a restored 19th-century red brick
building on the main street of town. Local lore has it that the
original inn, built in the 18th century, and the village got their
names when two road surveyors of the Old Philadelphia Pike couldn't
decide whether to stay at the inn that was in front of them or go
on to Lancaster. One of them said, ``A bird in hand, etc.,'' and so
the inn was named.
</P>
<P>
   Though we heard the passing klop-klop of horses' hooves through
the night, the noise seemed surreal, until the next morning.
Despite all the pictures, despite the movie ``Witness'' starring
Harrison Ford, which angered the Lancaster County Amish and put
them in a big way on the tourist maps, it was still startling to
see for the first time a black Amish buggy driven by men in dark
suits, long beards and straw hats. They looked like part of a stage
set, but turned out to be some of the most authentic sights we saw
all day.
</P>
<P>
   Our first stop Saturday morning was the People's Place, an
``interpretation center'' in Intercourse, where we arrived just
behind a tour bus and saw the slide documentary ``Who Are the
Amish?'' The photographs were lush, the narration intelligent. We
were told that the Amish struggle between seeking humility and
perfection, and that their lives are hardly idyllic. Like all
families, they have problems with the temptations of modern life.
This week, in fact, two Lancaster County Old Order Amish men in
their 20s were indicted on charges of buying cocaine and
distributing it to young members of the community.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs we walked through ``Amish World,'' a child-friendly
exhibition. There was an Amish buggy, Amish clothes for dress up
and a display of 12 months in the life of Amos and Susie, two
hypothetical Amish children. Some of the adult exhibits were a
little dense.
</P>
<P>
   (EDITORS: THE NEXT 8 GRAFS CAN BE EXCERPTED AS A SIDEBAR, OR
INCLUDED WITHIN THE MAINBAR, AS IS DONE HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Here is what I think is important to know, culled from
Kraybill's book:
</P>
<P>
   The Amish do not drive cars, use electricity from public
utilities, accept Social Security or Medicare benefits, or go to
war. They trace their roots to the religious upheavals of
16th-century Europe, when a group of renegades in Zurich became
impatient with the pace of the Protestant Reformation, and critical
of the continuing baptism of infants. In their view, only adults
able to choose obedience to Christ deserve baptism.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels were called Anabaptists, meaning ``rebaptizers,''
because they had already been baptized as infants in the Roman
Catholic Church. Adult baptism became the symbol of the new
movement, although Kraybill writes that the real issue was one of
control: were the Protestant and Catholic civil authorities the
interpreters of Christian faith, or was it the Bible?
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss radicals illegally rebaptized themselves in January
1525, an intolerable challenge to the state authorities who
controlled the church. Over the next 200 years, thousands of
Anabaptists were executed by civil and religious authorities;
Anabaptist hunters were commissioned to torture, burn, drown or
dismember them.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a Dutch Anabaptist, Menno Simons, became such a
powerful leader that his followers were soon calling themselves
Mennonites. The Amish emerged a century and a half later, in 1693,
after a split with the Mennonites led by Jacob Amman, a leader in
Alsace.
</P>
<P>
   The first large group of Amish to settle in Lancaster County
arrived in Philadelphia in 1737, on the ship the Charming Nancy.
The centuries of bloody persecution led in part to their decision
to separate themselves from the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Lancaster County is a complex mix of Amish sects and the
generally more modern Mennonites, lumped together under the term
Pennsylvania Dutch, which refers to the many groups that fled
southern Germany for Pennsylvania. (``Dutch'' is believed to be a
corruption of ``Deutsch.'')
</P>
<P>
   More progressive Amish groups have splintered off; today most of
Lancaster County's Amish are Old Order Amish, the most distinct in
their customs and the fastest growing and one of the largest groups
of Amish in the United States. They have worked as farmers
traditionally, but in recent years more than half the adults have
become entrepreneurs in small businesses like farm machinery,
furniture and crafts.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Next stop after the museum was Aaron and Jessica's Buggy Rides,
billed by the guidebooks as the only buggy business owned and run
by the Amish. Our buggy was a sedate gray, but unlike the enclosed
boxes that the Amish really drive, ours had big side windows for a
better view and rubber around the wheels for a smoother ride. The
Amish use steel, believing that rubber will lead to mobility and
the car.
</P>
<P>
   For half an hour, under a brilliant sky, our horse pulled past
alfalfa fields and orchards of pear, peach and apple trees. It was
quiet, bountiful and orderly, a landscape molded with thought and
discipline. Our guide pointed out a windmill, the house of a bishop
_ the main religious authority for the surrounding district _ and a
one-room school house.
</P>
<P>
   A 1972 Supreme Court decision gave the Amish the right to take
their children out of school after the eighth grade; the Amish
believe that a high school education separates children from their
parents and values.
</P>
<P>
   On the way back, our guide pulled the buggy into the driveway of
a small farmhouse, calling out to two children in Pennsylvania
German. The kids ran into the house and came back shyly offering us
a red horseshoe, which we bought for $2. ``You've made them very
happy,'' our guide said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ One good thing about ``The Art of the Motorcycle,''
opening Friday at the Guggenheim, is that by the time it's over
everyone should finally be sick and tired of jokes about the museum
as a big parking garage ramp.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Lloyd Wright know-it-alls, upon reading this sentence, are
probably already preparing letters to the effect that the
Guggenheim's design originated in a plan of Wright's during the
1920s to build a planetarium encircled by a kind of double-helix
system of ramps, a ziggurat for cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you see,'' these letters will no doubt say, ``the idea of
motorcycles in the Guggenheim is, in fact, a fulfillment . . . ''
Blah, blah, blah.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for the record, as far as motorcycles go, I drove a scooter
in Cozumel, Mexico, once, and as a boy I pedaled around Manhattan
on a banana bike, the kind that had the ``Easy Rider'' handlebars _
or in the biker lingo of the Guggenheim's He-man-size exhibition
catalog, ``ape hanger'' handlebars.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and I have visited the Henry Ford Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Having thus firmly established my bona fides, let me state the
following:
</P>
<P>
   1. The show, historically speaking, covers the ground between an
1868 French velocipede with a steam engine beneath the seat (ouch!)
and a sleek new MV Agusta. With 105 motorcycles, it is much too
big, but many of the bikes in it really are great to look at, and
you don't have to have a tattoo or know what a single-overhead-cam
valve gear with enclosed rockers is to admire them. I suspect that
men who have been dragged to Monet exhibitions over the years will
seek revenge here, though anyone with design sense will do fine in
it.
</P>
<P>
   2. Frank Gehry's installation of the exhibition, which includes
shiny stainless-steel panels along the rotunda side of Wright's
ramp, miraculously dematerializes the rotunda and suddenly makes
the inside of the museum resemble a machine: an apt metaphor. At
the same time, the panels nod to Gehry's Wright-influenced,
titanium-clad Guggenheim in Bilbao, so the whole effect is a kind
of spiral of allusion.
</P>
<P>
   3. Yes, it is weird to find motorcycles in the Guggenheim, which
has never done anything quite like this before, but American art
museums have always shown objects of design. And anyway, much of
the art in the Metropolitan, never mind the Modern or the
Cooper-Hewitt, originally had a practical purpose, whether it was a
bowl or a chariot. Motorcycles, better than many things, illustrate
technology and taste as they have evolved together in the 20th
century, which is an issue basic to modern art. Looking at one of
the earliest bikes here, an 1893 Millet from France, I thought of
``Ballet Mecanique,'' the machine age film that Leger, Gerald
Murphy, Man Ray and George Antheil made in the 1920s. It made
abstractions out of close-ups of churning engines like the
Millet's.
</P>
<P>
   4. Besides, the Guggenheim under Thomas Krens, to the
consternation of many people, has been stretching in new
directions, which isn't bad. Listed as the main curator for this
show, he has lately been tooling around on a BMW motorcycle, so he
can now officially be regarded as the biker outlaw of museum
directors.
</P>
<P>
   5.. Apropos of BMW, there have been complaints in the press
about the company's sponsorship of ``The Art of the Motorcycle'' _
and one can't help wondering which came first, the idea for the
exhibition or the realization that money would be available for
such a show. The museum is quick to counter that among the bikes on
view, 6 are BMWs, 10 are Harley-Davidsons, 9 are Hondas. OK,
corporate support doesn't necessarily mean corporate noodling in
curatorial decisions. But the true test of any show's credibility
is what it adds to the sum of human knowledge and happiness. Which
brings me to:
</P>
<P>
   6. The catalog, a curious document. Clearly it wants to be
scholarly. One essay informs us that: ``Neither writing nor riding
is possible without a certain violence. As the writer inscribes
paper with ink and words, so the motorcyclist cuts a line through
sheer space using angles and velocity as letters and punctuation.''
</P>
<P>
   And: ``The pipes are to the motorcyclist's identity what the
unconscious is to the Freudian subject: a large inaccessible
reservoir of feeling and meaning, which is a remainder of a
collective spirit. In both cases, one must listen at least twice
for the significance of the utterances.''
</P>
<P>
   At least.
</P>
<P>
   As for the catalog entries on each bike, some are good, some are
like this: ``The geared primary drive and multi-plate clutch, which
were on the left side, transmitted power to a four-speed gearbox.
The full-circle crankshaft featured a roller big-end bearing, with
a bronze small end bush. Lubrication was wet-sump, with a gear-type
oil pump.''
</P>
<P>
   I can only assume that this makes sense to mechanics and,
perhaps, sexologists.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the photographs are cool.
</P>
<P>
   So we take this show seriously at a certain peril, which is
fitting because motorcycles are frivolous to begin with: they're
about irresponsibility, about not conforming, about getting away.
Or at least they're about embracing the image of nonconformity.
Motorcyclists are also famous for riding in packs and dressing
alike. Every society has its rules, even Hell's Angels.
</P>
<P>
   That's just one cultural cliche motorcycles neatly reflect. An
early American bike, the bright orange and white 1911 Flying
Merkel, summons to mind tinted postcard images of barber shop
quartets, brass bands and summer fairs. I picture a snake-oil
salesman, in boater hat and high collar, riding one. The huge 1948
Indian Chief, the apex of mid-century kitsch (pinstripes, decals,
big red swooping fenders), in the same way encapsulates America's
extravagant postwar spirit. It's the motorcycle equivalent of the
Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   For another reason I like British bikes. They tend to be black
and practical, with sturdy engines and no frills, and, so I'm told,
they're a pain to kick-start. They evoke the ethos of tinned food
and vast unheated manor houses. Take the 1926 Brough Superior
SS100, massive and not obviously beautiful but very elegant on its
own terms. (It's T.E. Lawrence's bike.) Likewise, the classic 1939
Triumph seems to embody pragmatism on two wheels.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition has sales brochures and magazine ads to
illustrate the marketing of bikes in different countries to suit
diverse tastes. In the early 60s, for instance, Japanese companies,
in the wake of similar efforts by British manufacturers like
Triumph and American makers like Harley-Davidson, made a mark with
bikes geared to a growing affluent populace of anti-outlaws.
</P>
<P>
   Honda's ads showed clean-cut families with efficient little
vehicles like the Super Cub. The company's famous slogan was ``You
meet the nicest people on a Honda.'' Then it became ``The new
American motorcycle gang.'' The standard view of Japan is that it
has always adapted other cultures, then often surpassed them.
That's what you see here in later years, as well, when Japanese
manufacturers mimicked stripped-down American muscle bikes of the
'70s and '80s.
</P>
<P>
   These muscle bikes are ugly, but that's the point, I suppose.
Esthetically, I prefer a stylish eccentric like the streamlined
1930 French Majestic 350, canary yellow and blue, the engine and
wheels wrapped in bullet-shaped fairing with vents on the sides.
Tres chic. Even when the French tried to imitate American swagger
they remained French. The 1933 Dollar is a tough, compact bike with
an Indian-head gas cap and decal, but the Jaeger clock with its
dandyish Roman numerals is a Gallic giveaway.
</P>
<P>
   I must mention the show-stopper, a 1925 Boehmerland, a Czech
novelty resembling a circus prop. Red and yellow, it has a wooden
sidecar in the shape of a rocket and is bigger than many
automobiles. The museum label says the bike carries six people.
That seems like a small exaggeration. Six clowns maybe.
</P>
<P>
   In the end the Italians, naturally, make the really
memorable-looking motorcycles. Check out the enveloping shape of
the 1958 Aermacchi Chimera; the surreal 1995 Aprilia Moto 6.5,
designed by Philippe Starck, which resembles a wasp, and the MV
Agusta F4, whose frame and exposed machinery can bring to mind the
body of a sleek swimmer. These are truly beautiful objects.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the Vespa. Sophia Loren. The Via Veneto.
``Roman Holiday.'' ``La Dolce Vita,'' and that unmistakable drone
of the Vespa's engine, like a throaty laugh. I recall the famous
1953 photograph by Mario De Biasi of a woman striding toward a
group of goggle-eyed Italian men. The man nearest to her sits on
(what else?) a Vespa.
</P>
<P>
   To anyone who really knows motorcycles, it's probably one of the
least exciting bikes in the show. But I don't care. It's the one I
want.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   ``The Art of the Motorcycle'' remains at the Guggenheim Museum,
Fifth Avenue at 898th Street, through Sept. 20. ``The Motorcycle on
Screen,'' a program of about 40 films and videos, begins Friday and
runs through July 31. Screenings in the museum's theater are on

   NEW YORK _ At 5:30 a.m., the day after James Naughton opened in
his new one-man musical revue at the Manhattan Theater Club, he was
in a graveyard in Queens acting in a scene in an independent film
called ``Oxygen.'' Then, after a long day's work, he raced back to
the theater to give his next performance. As always, Naughton is
high on energy and talent.
</P>
<P>
   A two-time Tony winner for ``City of Angels'' and the revival of
``Chicago,'' he has performed at benefits and sung with other
actors in cabarets, and he is a dramatic actor of distinction. This
is his debut as a solo performer in an act of his own devising.
</P>
<P>
   In the show, which closes on Sunday, he sings ``Star Dust'' and
``Lazy River,'' Elvis Presley's ``Are You Lonesome Tonight'' and a
country western, ``I've Been Everywhere,'' by Hank Snow, in which
he tongue-trips through 96 places in America and then repeats the
words double time without missing a beat. Intentionally he omits
show tunes while mixing a repertory with ease and musicality. ``Who
knew that Naughton is also a pop crooner with an extraordinarily
beautiful voice?'' Stephen Holden wrote in his review in The New
York Times.
</P>
<P>
   If Naughton knew it, he was not telling anyone. Over lunch on
another long work day _ filming in the morning, singing in the
evening _ he admitted that it was odd to be dubbed a pop crooner
after almost 30 years in the theater, adding that singing had come
to him naturally ever since he was a child. He has had very little
musical training, but possesses what he calls ``an iron voice'' and
has even sung through a cold as the Bogart-like detective in ``City
of Angels.''
</P>
<P>
   His effortless way with a tune is one reason he has avoided
making singing a career. Music is for entertainment, for noodling
around, and when he has been in a success he leaves after a year to
get back to the real business of acting. Although he is greatly in
demand as a musical star, he has done only three Broadway musicals.
(His first was ``I Love My Wife'' in 1977.)
</P>
<P>
   For years he has acted in films and on television to pay for his
summer vocation. He lives for the time he goes to the Williamstown
Theater Festival to challenge himself as an actor, and, in recent
years, as a director, and yes, he would have done these plays in
New York, if it were possible to do these plays in New York.
</P>
<P>
   At Williamstown, Naughton has done plays by Arthur Miller, Maxim
Gorky and a full range of roles by Tennessee Williams, including
Shannon, the defrocked priest in ``The Night of the Iguana,'' and
Alvaro Mangiacavallo in ``The Rose Tattoo,'' starring in both with
Maria Tucci.
</P>
<P>
   Naughton had often delighted audiences at Williamstown cabarets
and had thought about doing an act by himself, but kept putting it
off. About two years ago, he was asked to participate in a tribute
to Cy Coleman, the composer of his first two Broadway musicals, and
he chose a torch song, ``With Every Breath I Take,'' which had been
sung by an actress in ``City of Angels.''
</P>
<P>
   George Shearing, who was at his table, was taken with his
performance and encouraged him, even making a tape of songs he
might sing. Buoyed by Shearing's enthusiasm and by that of Mary
Cleere Haran, a cabaret star who also had suggestions, he finally
made his solo bow.
</P>
<P>
   Matched with John Oddo, for years Rosemary Clooney's musical
director and pianist, he put together an eclectic act, in contrast
with many other singers who specialize in one kind of number or in
work by a single composer. Partly he drew from his own backlog of
favorite songs. His aim was to create a show that would have a
dramatic curve as well as musical verve. What unifies the songs, of
course, is the singer and his engaging personality.
</P>
<P>
   Walking on stage with nonchalance, he intersperses songs with
patter about musical and theatrical matters (like stage fright).
Any night he might add a tune or a story. With a jazz-flavored
five-piece band in the background, the show is informal, as if
Naughton is making it up on the spot, although many hours have gone
into its preparation.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with his summertime roles, the show is resolutely
upbeat, which means that for once his art is drawing on his life.
``When I was a young actor,'' he said, ``I couldn't get enough of
the really tragic plays, the more dramatic, the more depressing the
better. The older I get, the more appreciation I have for the joy
you can have and you can give in singing.''
</P>
<P>
   Naughton said that his career has been serendipitous, but that
now he plans to take more initiative: directing, acting in more
plays by O'Neill and, of course, presenting a reprise of his
one-man revue.
</P>
<P>
   When he graduated from Yale Drama School, he made his New York
debut (in 1971) in the off-Broadway revival of ``Long Day's Journey
Into Night,'' starring Robert Ryan and Geraldine Fitzgerald. Since
then he has never stopped acting and though he continues to work in
movies and television (as host of a trial series on Court TV), most
of his roles have been on Broadway or in regional theaters near his
home in Connecticut. That is by choice, so that he could have a
family life with his wife, Pamela, and their two children, now both
grown.
</P>
<P>
   His son, Greg, and his daughter, Keira, both actors, are in the
family business, Greg Naughton as the artistic director of the Blue
Light Theater, one of the more enterprising of the new
off-off-Broadway companies. For Blue Light, James Naughton has
acted with his son (in ``Golden Boy'') and directed (``Filumena''),
and Pamela Naughton is the director of development. ``It's very
difficult to make a life _ and a living _ in the theater,'' said
James Naughton, ``but that's where my life has been.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been working for 28 years,'' he added. ``I'm 52, and I'm
only halfway through my career.'' Looking forward to that evening's
show and everything that will follow, he said, ``It feels like this
is the prime time.''

TIANANMEN SQUARE MARKS A HISTORY OF VIVID CONTRASTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: The reception for the president is scheduled at 9 p.m. EDT
Friday, 9 a.m. Saturday in Beijing.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ORVILLE SCHELL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ What makes President Clinton's scheduled reception in
Tiananmen Square in front of the Great Hall of the People so
sensitive is the historical resonance of this place in the minds of
the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
   Although Tiananmen Square _ the largest public square in the
world _ was constructed by Mao Zedong after ``liberation'' in 1949
to celebrate the triumph of a secular revolution, for most Chinese
it also has an almost mystical dimension as the place where the
soul of China resides.
</P>
<P>
   Because Tiananmen, the Gate of Heavenly Peace, was the portal
into ``the great within'' of the Forbidden City where emperors held
court during imperial times, it became the most symbolic point of
connection between ordinary Chinese and the Son of Heaven.
</P>
<P>
   It was from the Gate of Heavenly Peace that imperial edicts were
lowered in gilded ``cloud trays'' to berobed officials prostrated
below for transmission across the empire. It was through the gate's
portals that the emperor and his vast retinue passed whenever they
left the Forbidden City.
</P>
<P>
   And because Mao chose to build the mammoth Great Hall of the
People on the enlarged square's west side and then to take up
residence just adjacent to the emperor's old palace, Tiananmen
Square also became the symbolic interface in contemporary times
between the Chinese Communist Party and the ``broad masses of the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Because it was a traditional emblem of the state's figurative
bond with its people, Tiananmen Gate and the area in front of it
became the place to which people began coming to seek a redress of
grievances when ideas about democracy began to filter into China at
the turn of the century. Thus it acquired something of a split
personality _ the figurative seat of state power, on the one hand,
and a place of remonstration and dissent, on the other.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous of all demonstrations was the May 4th Incident
in 1919, when patriotic students marched in front of the Gate of
Heavenly Peace to protest the government's accession at Versailles
to giving Germany's concessions in China to Japan after World War
I.
</P>
<P>
   Although the demonstrations _ China's first _ lasted only one
day, this led to a much larger movement that inspired a whole
generation of intellectuals, including most of the founders of the
Chinese Communist Party, with the new watchwords of the day:
``science and democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1919, demonstrations in the square have followed one on
the other as these contradictory forces _ led by those who viewed
it as a symbol of the state's right to rule and by those who saw it
as a place of the people's right to remonstrate with official power
_ struggled over its symbolic power.
</P>
<P>
   Again in 1925, Chinese rallied in front of Tiananmen Gate
against the ``unequal treaties'' that gave foreigners
extraterritorial rights in China.
</P>
<P>
   In 1926, the first blood was spilled when government troops
fired on crowds protesting capitulation to Japanese demands. When
50 people were killed, China's most famous writer, Lu Xun, wrote
prophetically that ``Lies written in ink can never disguise truths
written in blood. Blood debts must be repaid in kind; the longer
the delay, the greater the interest.''
</P>
<P>
   These words were to resonate with eerie prescience in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   In 1935, students again gathered before Tiananmen, this time to
protest Chiang Kai-shek's refusal to form a united front with Mao
to fight the Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, Mao himself stood atop Tiananmen to proclaim that, at
last, China had ``stood up'' to establish a new independent and
sovereign government. In 1966, Mao was back, ironically, to rally a
million young Red Guards and to launch the Cultural Revolution in
an attack against the very Communist Party he himself had set up.
</P>
<P>
   Not until 1976, when beloved Prime Minister Zhou Enlai died, was
the square rebaptized with mass dissent. On April 5, tens of
thousands of grief-stricken Chinese spontaneously flooded in to pay
their respects to Zhou and indirectly to voice a protest against
the extreme leftist policies of Mao and the Gang of Four.
</P>
<P>
   Again in the winter of 1986-'87, students demanding more rapid
political reform and democratization broke through police cordons
and reached the square.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1989, the demonstration-of-all-demonstrations
erupted when, after the death of liberal ex-Communist Party Chief
Hu Yaobang _ who had been unceremoniously defrocked by Deng
Xiaoping _ Chinese again spontaneously poured into the square to
pay their final respects.
</P>
<P>
   These demonstrations ended six weeks later in the massacre of
June 3, which confirmed as never before the square's significance
as a place of protest against official power.
</P>
<P>
   It is into this highly symbolic place so supercharged with
history that President Clinton will be greeted by Chinese President
Jiang Zemin beginning at 9 p.m. EDT Friday. Indeed, Clinton will be
officially welcomed to Beijing at almost precisely that spot at the
east entrance to the Great Hall of the People where in April 1989
students were rebuked as they kneeled on the steps to present their
petition of grievance and where soldiers mustered to expel students
from the square.

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   China's leadership has made Clinton's appearance here as a one
price of entry for this state visit and a tithe to be paid in
advance of creating the ``new strategic alliance'' between the
United States and China that has become the centerpiece of the
president's trip.
</P>
<P>
   For Americans, Clinton's symbolic presence in Tiananmen Square
will recall the vivid imagery of the 1989 student movement and the
massacre that ended it.
</P>
<P>
   For Chinese, however, the imagery will resonate with far more
history. It will harken all the way back to the May 4th Movement of
1919, when the clarion call for democratic reform first broke out
as public protest.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's appearance, which will be broadcast all across
China, also will help reinforce the part of the square's symbolism
that has centered around state power. It will help the Chinese
leadership re-establish in the minds of its people a sense that the
Communist Party _ and not those who have used it to seek a redress
of grievances _ is the rightful heir to Tiananmen Square's
conflicted legacy.

`DAIMLER-BENZ IN THE THIRD REICH': AN INDUSTRIAL STOP BEFORE
AUSCHWITZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By HERBERT MITGANG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ranks of the Third Reich were filled both with true
believers and opportunists in every field of the arts, sciences and
professions _ musicians, physicians, professors, rocketeers,
bankers, lawyers, judges, journalists _ who lent their names and
talents to the Nazi regime.
</P>
<P>
   They were not just Hitler's legions committing war crimes in
uniform but also a cross section of Germany's civilian society. Not
everyone was involved, to be sure, but opposition was minuscule and
occurred only late in the war, when defeat clearly loomed.
</P>
<P>
   So it's not surprising that industrialists helped build the vast
military machines of the Wehrmacht and the Luftwaffe; turning out
armaments instead of passenger cars was a natural progression for
German big business on the home front.
</P>
<P>
   What is startling to read in ``Daimler-Benz in the Third
Reich,'' Neil Gregor's well-documented study of the automaker in
wartime, is the extent of complicity by owners and managers in the
deadly excesses of their country. At the same time that the
manufacturer of Hitler's favorite car, the Mercedes-Benz, was
building tanks, trucks and aircraft engines for the war effort, it
was also a transit point for people going to the death camps, with
the collusion of the SS, the fuehrer's most-feared special police
force.
</P>
<P>
   ``In pursuit of their own interests,'' Gregor coolly writes,
``companies actively participated in the exploitation of foreign,
concentration camp and Jewish labor, in `Aryanization' policies and
in the exploitation of the occupied territories. Daimler-Benz was
no exception here.''
</P>
<P>
   In an analysis, the author offers a bold conclusion: ``Without
the collaboration of industry, none of these crimes would have been
possible. Industry placed its own interests _ directly and
indirectly, the pursuit of profit _ above those of the victims of
the regime.''
</P>
<P>
   In retaliatory measures that followed the enemy's own terror
tactics against Britain and occupied Europe, Allied bombers hit
industrial targets deep inside Germany with increasing
effectiveness. Damaged plants were moved to remote areas or placed
underground. A great need arose for slave and foreign labor to take
the place of workers and soldiers called to the Eastern and Western
fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Here the interests of Daimler-Benz and the SS both merged and
clashed. The auto maker-turned-armament-maker needed replacements
for skilled and unskilled workers to keep their factories running
and profitable; the SS needed more bodies to fulfill the quotas for
the ovens at Auschwitz and the other concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   A Nazi racial hierarchy developed inside the Daimler-Benz
factories, with thousands of Jewish slave laborers being treated
even worse than Polish workers. The author writes: ``In other
words, as soon as the company had trained their replacements, it
was ready to release the Jews for deportation _ in the full
knowledge of what this meant for the Jews concerned. For
Daimler-Benz, only the securing of a steady production was
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Daimler-Benz, like other companies producing arms for the Third
Reich, became one of the way stations to the death camps. For a
comparatively lucky few, being assigned to the factories sometimes
meant being saved by Allied ground forces as they conquered
Germany. But that was hardly the concern or the intention of
Daimler-Benz's management.
</P>
<P>
   ``Self-identification with the company took precedence over any
self-identification with the real suffering of humans,'' Gregor
writes. ``The company was able to survive in a relatively healthy
position down to the end of the war at least partly at the expense
of the health, and indeed in many cases the lives, of these
thousands of victims of forced labor.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no ``Schindler's List'' at Daimler-Benz.
</P>
<P>
   In a left-handed compliment, the author leaves the impression
that the owners and managers of Daimler-Benz were shrewder than
Hitler, his lieutenants and the SS. With some exceptions, they were
not fighting for the barbarian ideals of the Third Reich but for
the future of their company. When the SS put pressure on them to
increase armament production near the end of the war, they went
through the motions but made sure to save their most expensive
machinery for postwar cars and trucks. Wars end, but business is
business.
</P>
<P>
   The book doesn't cover the personal finances of the company's
management; it would be useful to know whether the owners enriched
themselves during the war. The author does note that the company
introduced ``new pay and incentive structures'' to help increase
production.
</P>
<P>
   Another omission is the matter of civilian criminality and
postwar clearing of industrialists. Undeniably, Daimler-Benz and
other companies used slave labor and prisoners of war in their
factories. Their top boss, Albert Speer, the Nazi minister of
armaments, was sentenced to 20 years as a major war criminal at the
Nuremberg trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daimler-Benz in the Third Reich'' isn't polemical in tone; its
devastating facts speak for themselves. Gregor, a lecturer in
European history at Southampton University in Britain, was given
access to the Mercedes-Benz archives. He also drew upon documents
recently made available after East and West Germany were united.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a strong addition to our knowledge of the role of
big business under the Nazis. Gregor's book graphically
demonstrates how industry was essential for Hitler's dreams of
conquest. It deserves a place on the shelves with William L.
Shirer's ``Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,'' Primo Levi's
``Survival in Auschwitz'' and Arthur D. Morse's ``While Six Million
Died.''
</P>
<P>
   Since this history was written, Daimler-Benz of Stuttgart and
the Chrysler Corporation of Detroit have agreed to merge. That
makes ``Daimler-Benz in the Third Reich'' all the more timely; but
don't expect to find the book in the glove compartment of any of
their new cars.

   CHINA-CLINTON (Xian, China) _ With the pageantry of thundering
drums and clanging gongs, President Clinton was welcomed to China
tonight, the first American President to visit this country in
nearly a decade. The 30-minute ceremony was a made-for-TV
spectacle, replete with warriors in Tang dynasty costumes, a score
of maidens in flowing white gowns bearing baskets of flowers and
yellow-robed riders astride strutting horses. Red paper lanterns
hung from the lampposts and bright silk banners bearing images of
mythical birds of good fortune flapped in the breeze on a mild
smoggy night. By John M. Broder. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-SCENE (Xian, China) _ On this steamy summer night, the
people of Xian took to the streets to welcome Bill Clinton on the
first stop of his state visit, in what may well be the largest
spontaneous public display of affection in modern China. ``There's
never been another event like this here, I don't think I've ever
seen this many people come out for anything,'' said Sun Qinqi, an
engineer, who said he'd decided to pass up the World Cup to cram
onto the sidewalk just inside the South Gate to catch a glimpse of
the Presidential motorcade's arrival. By Elisabeth Rosenthal.
</P>
<P>
   NIRELAND-VOTE (Belfast, Northern Ireland) _ The Northern Ireland
peace effort marked another milestone today as residents of the
long polarized province turned out in large numbers to elect
members of a new legislature. Voters were choosing 108 lawmakers
from a field of nearly 300 candidates from once warring parties to
serve in the Northern Ireland Assembly. The new body will restore
local government here for the first time since the British imposed
direct rule in 1972. By Warren Hoge. &QL;

   SCOTUS-VETO (Washington) _ The Supreme Court ruled today that
the president could not cancel individual items of federal spending
and tax breaks approved by Congress because such ``line item
vetoes'' circumvent the law-making procedure prescribed by the
Constitution. The ruling is a major blow to Congress and to
President Clinton, who, like many of his predecessors, coveted tax
and spending powers that he did not have. By Robert Pear.
</P>
<P>
   SCOTUS-AIDS (Washington) _ People with H.I.V. infection need not
have any symptoms of disease or obvious impairment to be covered by
the Federal law that bars discrimination on the basis of
disability, the Supreme Court ruled in a major victory for people
with the virus that causes AIDS. Voting 5 to 4, the Justices agreed
with a Federal appeals court's ruling that a woman with
asymptomatic H.I.V. infection, who was refused care in a dentist's
office, met the definition of disability under the Americans with
Disabilities Act. By Linda Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   SCOTUS-STARR (Washington) _ The Supreme Court today broadly
affirmed the rights of clients to take to their graves their
consultations with lawyers. The ruling was a legal setback to the
Whitewater independent counsel, who was seeking notes taken by the
lawyer for Vincent W. Foster Jr., the deputy White House counsel
who committed suicide nearly five years ago. The justices' 6-3
decision found that the three pages of notes taken by Mr. Foster's

its protection under the lawyer-client privilege when Mr. Foster
died nine days later. By Stephen Labaton.

   VATICAN-LUTHERANS (Undated) _ In a decision that brings to a
close a divisive chapter of the Reformation, the Vatican said
yesterday that the Roman Catholic Church will sign a joint
declaration with the world's Lutherans that affirms that Catholics
and Lutherans share a basic understanding of how human beings
receive salvation. The document, approved last week by the Lutheran
World Federation, declares that Catholics and Lutherans have common
ground to overcome the issue that split the Western Christian world
nearly 500 years ago -- the question of whether ``justification''
comes solely through faith in God, as Luther held, or whether a
person's good works also play a role, as Catholics emphasized. By

worlds throbbing with life, are now drawing closer in cosmic terms
to the world of their discoverers. The latest detection, made this
month by American astronomers, is of a planet about twice the mass
of Jupiter orbiting the star Gliese 876, one of the Sun's nearest
neighbors at a distance of only 15 light-years away. Previous
confirmed extrasolar planets have been observed at stars 40 to 80
light-years away. By John Noble Wilford.

   GM-STRIKE (Flint, Mich.) _ Like a large stone thrown in a pond,

The first effects were felt immediately in this town when the
strike began, because General Motors accounts for more than half
the employment and taxes here. When 3,400 workers went on strike at
a metal parts stamping factory here on June 5, nearby restaurants
lost half their business immediately, while the pool table and bar
stools at the pub across the street have been deserted for the last
three weeks. The next ripples came over the last two weeks as the
company has closed 26 of its 29 assembly plants in North America
and curtailed production at nearly 100 parts factories. Now the
effects are reaching across the country, into communities and
states where the auto industry has been less visible than here in
the industrial Midwest. By Keith Bradsher.

JUSTICES STRIKE DOWN LINE-ITEM VETO AS UNCONSTITUTIONAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional ending) 
 
By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Thursday dealt a blow to the
power of U.S. presidents, striking down as unconstitutional a law
that enabled chief executives to delete individual funding items
from massive budget legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In a 6-3 decision, the high court ruled the Line Item Veto Act
violated the constitution's separation of powers between Congress,
which approves legislation, and the president, who either signs it
into law or vetoes it.
</P>
<P>
   The president, however, has no authority to erase individual
provisions in legislation, the justices said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the Constitution expressly authorizes the president
to play a role in the process of enacting statutes, it is silent on
the subject of unilateral presidential action that either repeals
or amends parts of duly enacted statutes,'' Justice John Paul
Stevens wrote for the majority. ``There are powerful reasons for
construing constitutional silence on this profoundly important
issue as equivalent to an express prohibition.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton issued a statement saying he was ``deeply
disappointed'' by the Supreme Court's ruling, which he called ``a
defeat for all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It deprives the president of a valuable tool for eliminating
waste in the federal budget and for enlivening the public debate
over how to make the best use of public funds,'' Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
   However, Rep. David Skaggs, D-Colo., who joined House and Senate
colleagues in waging an unsuccessful challenge to the law last
year, said he feels vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank goodness the Supreme Court has saved Congress from
itself,'' Skaggs said. ``The court has restored an absolutely
central provision to our constitutional balance: that Congress
writes the laws and can't give that power and responsibility
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the controversial statute, a president could _ after
signing a budget bill into law _ unilaterally strike individual
funding sections of the measure. Congress could create a separate
bill to restore the deleted provisions with a majority vote of both
the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   However, the high court said the law violates the Constitution's
``single, finely wrought and exhaustively considered procedure''
for the enactment of laws. That process requires the president to
approve or reject legislation in full, whereas the Line Item Veto
Act impermissibly allowed him to strike legislation piecemeal, the
justices added.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Line Item Veto Act were valid, it would authorize the
president to create a different law _ one whose text was not voted
on by either house of Congress or presented to the president for
signature,'' Stevens wrote. ``If there is to be a new procedure in
which the president will play a different role in determining the
final text of what may become a law, such a change must come not by
legislation but through the amendment procedures set forth in ...
the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Ruth Bader
Ginsburg, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter and Clarence Thomas
joined Stevens' opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, in a concurring opinion, took a swipe at Congress for
what he characterized as its cowardly attempt to surrender to the
president by statute its primary authority to raise and spend
federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Failure of political will does not justify unconstitutional
remedies,'' Kennedy wrote. ``Abdication of responsibility is not
part of the constitutional design.''
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting Justice Antonin Scalia, taking the unusual and
intense step of reading part of his dissent from the bench,
defended the law as a legitimate exercise of Congress'
constitutional prerogative.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers who dubbed the law the Line Item Veto Act ``succeeded
in faking out the Supreme Court'' because the statute does not give
the president new veto authority, Scalia said. Instead, the law
merely allows presidents to continue what they have always done by
exercising executive discretion to spend or not spend money
Congress has appropriated.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Stephen G. Breyer joined
Scalia's dissent.
</P>
<P>
   The case the high court decided, Clinton vs. New York City,
marked the second time the justices considered the
constitutionality of the Line Item Veto Act, which went into effect
in January 1997. Last year, the court rejected a challenge from
senators and representatives who said the statute violated the
authority of Congress to write laws.
</P>
<P>
   The high court said the lawmakers lacked standing to bring the
challenge because they suffered no injury as a result of the law's
enactment. In this year's case, the court _ over an objection from
Scalia _ said New York City and Idaho potato farmers could
challenge the law's constitutionality after Clinton eliminated
sections of funding legislation that would have benefited the city
and farmers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In New York's case, Clinton struck a section of the 1997
Balanced Budget Act that would have relieved the city's Health and
Hospitals Corp. of having to pay millions of dollars in retroactive
tax liability.
</P>
<P>
   With regard to the Idaho group, the president eliminated a
provision of the 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act that would have given
potato farmers a capital gains tax break in purchasing a processing
facility.

<TEXT>
<P>
   To visit Pennsylvania's Amish country is to drive 150 miles from
New York City and feel like an outsider in your own land. I have
lived in New Delhi and Tokyo, but I felt almost as foreign in Bird
in Hand and Intercourse, two villages at the historic center of the
Amish settlement, where my family and I spent a recent weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Although I found much to love in the area _ the honest food, the
impressive quilts, the plain, verdant esthetic _ there were
uncomfortable moments over the two days.
</P>
<P>
   When my husband asked our Amish buggy driver about the attitude
of the traditional Old Order Amish toward the more modern groups,
the driver sternly replied: ``There aren't any attitudes. The Bible
tells us not to judge others.''
</P>
<P>
   A sign at Hannah Stoltzfoos Quilts &AMP; Handmades warned, ``No
photographs, no tourists beyond this gate.''
</P>
<P>
   In a museum slide documentary, an Amish farmer recounted how a
tourist once asked him, ``Hey, are you for real?'' The farmer,
disdainful, replied: ``No, we're the fake ones. The real ones live
down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   The Amish clearly have a complicated relationship with the
tourists who make their roads impassable in summer yet spend $400
million a year in Lancaster County, much of it on Amish-made
products. As Dr. Donald B. Kraybill writes in ``The Riddle of Amish
Culture'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1989), one of the best
books on the community, ``To discard the buggy, for instance, would
not only break Amish tradition but also shatter powerful
expectations placed upon them by the outside world.'' In this way,
Kraybill says, tourism may be inadvertently strengthening, not
diluting, Amish life.
</P>
<P>
   The Amish of Lancaster County are, after all, thriving; they
numbered around 1,000 at the turn of the century, compared with
22,000 today.
</P>
<P>
   So there is more than ever to see, and to stew about. How can
you understand a culture whose essence is not letting outsiders in?
</P>
<P>
   Our weekend began in Times Square late on a Friday afternoon.
The four of us _ my husband and me and our children, Madeleine, 8,
and Teddy, 4 _ drove for three and a half hours, then checked into
the Village Inn of Bird in Hand, a restored 19th-century red brick
building on the main street of town. Local lore has it that the
original inn, built in the 18th century, and the village got their
names when two road surveyors of the Old Philadelphia Pike couldn't
decide whether to stay at the inn that was in front of them or go
on to Lancaster. One of them said, ``A bird in hand, etc.,'' and so
the inn was named.
</P>
<P>
   Though we heard the passing klop-klop of horses' hooves through
the night, the noise seemed surreal, until the next morning.
Despite all the pictures, despite the movie ``Witness'' starring
Harrison Ford, which angered the Lancaster County Amish and put
them in a big way on the tourist maps, it was still startling to
see for the first time a black Amish buggy driven by men in dark
suits, long beards and straw hats. They looked like part of a stage
set, but turned out to be some of the most authentic sights we saw
all day.
</P>
<P>
   Our first stop Saturday morning was the People's Place, an
``interpretation center'' in Intercourse, where we arrived just
behind a tour bus and saw the slide documentary ``Who Are the
Amish?'' The photographs were lush, the narration intelligent. We
were told that the Amish struggle between seeking humility and
perfection, and that their lives are hardly idyllic. Like all
families, they have problems with the temptations of modern life.
This week, in fact, two Lancaster County Old Order Amish men in
their 20s were indicted on charges of buying cocaine and
distributing it to young members of the community.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs we walked through ``Amish World,'' a child-friendly
exhibition. There was an Amish buggy, Amish clothes for dress up
and a display of 12 months in the life of Amos and Susie, two
hypothetical Amish children. Some of the adult exhibits were a
little dense.
</P>
<P>
   (EDITORS: THE NEXT 8 GRAFS CAN BE EXCERPTED AS A SIDEBAR, OR
INCLUDED WITHIN THE MAINBAR, AS IS DONE HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Here is what I think is important to know, culled from
Kraybill's book:
</P>
<P>
   The Amish do not drive cars, use electricity from public
utilities, accept Social Security or Medicare benefits, or go to
war. They trace their roots to the religious upheavals of
16th-century Europe, when a group of renegades in Zurich became
impatient with the pace of the Protestant Reformation, and critical
of the continuing baptism of infants. In their view, only adults
able to choose obedience to Christ deserve baptism.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels were called Anabaptists, meaning ``rebaptizers,''
because they had already been baptized as infants in the Roman
Catholic Church. Adult baptism became the symbol of the new
movement, although Kraybill writes that the real issue was one of
control: were the Protestant and Catholic civil authorities the
interpreters of Christian faith, or was it the Bible?
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss radicals illegally rebaptized themselves in January
1525, an intolerable challenge to the state authorities who
controlled the church. Over the next 200 years, thousands of
Anabaptists were executed by civil and religious authorities;
Anabaptist hunters were commissioned to torture, burn, drown or
dismember them.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a Dutch Anabaptist, Menno Simons, became such a
powerful leader that his followers were soon calling themselves
Mennonites. The Amish emerged a century and a half later, in 1693,
after a split with the Mennonites led by Jacob Amman, a leader in
Alsace.
</P>
<P>
   The first large group of Amish to settle in Lancaster County
arrived in Philadelphia in 1737, on the ship the Charming Nancy.
The centuries of bloody persecution led in part to their decision
to separate themselves from the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Lancaster County is a complex mix of Amish sects and the
generally more modern Mennonites, lumped together under the term
Pennsylvania Dutch, which refers to the many groups that fled
southern Germany for Pennsylvania. (``Dutch'' is believed to be a
corruption of ``Deutsch.'')
</P>
<P>
   More progressive Amish groups have splintered off; today most of
Lancaster County's Amish are Old Order Amish, the most distinct in
their customs and the fastest growing and one of the largest groups
of Amish in the United States. They have worked as farmers
traditionally, but in recent years more than half the adults have
become entrepreneurs in small businesses like farm machinery,
furniture and crafts.

   Next stop after the museum was Aaron and Jessica's Buggy Rides,
billed by the guidebooks as the only buggy business owned and run
by the Amish. Our buggy was a sedate gray, but unlike the enclosed
boxes that the Amish really drive, ours had big side windows for a
better view and rubber around the wheels for a smoother ride. The
Amish use steel, believing that rubber will lead to mobility and
the car.
</P>
<P>
   For half an hour, under a brilliant sky, our horse pulled past
alfalfa fields and orchards of pear, peach and apple trees. It was
quiet, bountiful and orderly, a landscape molded with thought and
discipline. Our guide pointed out a windmill, the house of a bishop
_ the main religious authority for the surrounding district _ and a
one-room school house.
</P>
<P>
   A 1972 Supreme Court decision gave the Amish the right to take
their children out of school after the eighth grade; the Amish
believe that a high school education separates children from their
parents and values.
</P>
<P>
   On the way back, our guide pulled the buggy into the driveway of
a small farmhouse, calling out to two children in Pennsylvania
German. The kids ran into the house and came back shyly offering us
a red horseshoe, which we bought for $2. ``You've made them very
happy,'' our guide said.

COURT RULES LINE-ITEM VETO UNCONSTITUTIONAL 
</HEADLINE>

minor edits throughout.) (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court said Thursday that Congress
violated the Constitution's separation-of-powers rule when it gave
the president authority to cut individual projects out of tax and
spending bills without vetoing the entire legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In a 6-3 decision, the court said the 1996 Line Item Veto Act
unconstitutionally allows the president, by altering a bill after
its passage, to create a law that was not voted on by either house
of Congress. The court also said the 1996 measure authorized the
president to issue what were, in practical terms, partial vetoes.
</P>
<P>
   The only way such vetoes can be authorized is through a
constitutional amendment, the justices said.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the court, Justice John Paul Stevens said
authorization for a presidential line item veto could not come from
Congress ``but through the amendment procedures set forth in
Article V of the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Republican Sens. Dan Coats of Indiana and John McCain
of Arizona introduced a bill hours after the court's ruling seeking
to undo it by statute rather than amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the decision ``a defeat for fiscal responsibility and a
defeat for the American taxpayer,'' the senators said their measure
would require that individual spending items be considered as
separate bills, allowing the president to veto them individually.
</P>
<P>
   In passing the 1996 law, Congress said the president could
cancel individual items in tax and spending bills within five days
of signing them into law. But the measure allowed lawmakers to try
to reinstate the items by having both houses pass them in separate
bills.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was the first president to exercise a line item veto, an
authority sought by nearly every chief executive this century as a
tool to limit pork-barrel spending.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said the law ``authorized the president himself to
effect the repeal of laws, for his own policy reasons, without
observing Article 1 procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   Article 1 of the Constitution established the principle of
separation of powers among the three branches of government.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens concluded that the 1996 act ``may or may not be
desirable, but it is surely not a document'' that is
constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the justices heard a challenge to the act brought by
six members of Congress, but it dismissed their suit, saying they
had no standing to sue because they had not suffered any injury
from the veto, which at that point Clinton had not exercised.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the president has canceled 82 items in 11 laws.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, New York City, a hospital and two hospital
associations, challenged the law, arguing that one of the canceled
items had caused them financial injury. Their suit sought
restoration of a provision that would have given New York state
preferential treatment in receiving federal matching funds under
the Medicaid program for poor people.
</P>
<P>
   The state estimated that losing the matching funds would cost it
as much as $700 annually. The city was expected to lose nearly $400
million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, this case was about more than an important
constitutional principle,'' said Leonard J. Koerner, the lawyer
representing the City of New York. ``It was about a large amount of
money that we were going to lose year after year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Snake River Potato Growers and an officer of the Idaho group
also sued, saying they were injured by Clinton's veto of a tax
measure that would have allowed agricultural processors to defer
capital-gains taxes when they sell their plants to farmers'
cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration estimated that the growers would have
been able to avoid paying $98 million in taxes over the next five
years and $155 million over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a U.S. District Court here ruled the line-item veto
unconstitutional, saying Congress violated the Constitution's
separation of powers clause by delegating a key legislative power
to the president.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday the high court agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens acknowledged the ``profound importance'' of the case,
saying, ``The court expresses no opinion about the wisdom of the
act's procedures and does not lightly conclude that the actions of
the Congress that passed it, and the president who signed it into
law, were unconstitutional.''
</P>
<P>
   In their arguments before the court, lawyers for the challengers
said that no matter when a president changes a tax or spending bill
or for what reasons, the end result is not what was passed by both
chambers of Congress, as required by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   In his argument for the Clinton administration, U.S. Solicitor
General Seth Waxman contended that a line item veto would not
actually repeal part of a law but would be a presidential exercise
of spending authority delegated by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens was joined in his opinion by Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, David Souter, Clarence
Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Stephen Breyer, Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia
dissented.
</P>
<P>
   Breyer's dissent said that while the Line Item Veto Act ``skirts
a constitutional edge ... it does not violate any basic separation
of powers principle.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the court, in applying the Constitution's
provisions delegating legislative powers to Congress and vesting
executive powers in the president, has in the past ``interpreted
them generously in terms of the institutional arrangements that
they permit.''

ANOTHER CHANCE FOR `AMISTAD'  
 NEW VIDEO RELEASES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Another Chance For `Amistad'
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those films that had big hype in the beginning
and never panned out in theaters,'' said Michael Becker. ``That
always leaves the door nice and open to do well on video.''
</P>
<P>
   Becker, proprietor of the Video Room, a store on the Upper East
Side of Manhattan, was referring to ``Amistad,'' Steven Spielberg's
film about a slave ship revolt in 1839. Not that the movie flopped
completely in theaters last winter: it eventually collected $44.3
million at the box office. But a much better result was expected
for the heavily promoted film from Dreamworks, the studio whose
co-founder was Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Universal will issue ``Amistad'' the video in standard
and wide-screen versions. What's the prognosis? In tone and heft
the film is somewhat reminiscent of ``Schindler's List,''
Spielberg's 1993 epic about the Holocaust. Generally speaking,
though, video dealers aren't as excited about ``Amistad'' as they
were about ``Schindler,'' which rented and sold strongly in many
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   When ``Amistad'' opened in theaters, reviewers hung terms like
``serious,'' ``important'' and ``earnest'' on the film, a solid
acknowledgment of worthiness if not exactly a rallying call to a
broadly appealing entertainment. Video more or less holds the same
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The Movie Monitor, a tip sheet for video dealers that grades
films and recommends the number of copies the average store should
carry, calls ``Amistad'' a film for ``serious'' renters. In the
Monitor, the movie rates highly in star power (Anthony Hopkins,
Morgan Freeman and Djimon Hounsou), gets a respectable if not
superlative B for reviews by major critics and scores strongly for
``legs,'' meaning length of theatrical run (the film ran into the
spring).
</P>
<P>
   That translates into a recommendation of 10 copies for the
average store, which is a moderate number for a big film. ``It
isn't for middle America,'' said Rich Thorward, publisher of The
Monitor. ``It's not wide-scale black, either. It's like
`Schindler's List' that way: upscale areas did well, blue-collar
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Debbie Allen, who proposed the idea for
``Amistad'' to Spielberg in 1994 and produced the film with him and
Colin Wilson, said video would ``open a wider viewership.''
</P>
<P>
   Becker agrees. In an affluent area, his store will stock about
20 copies. ``Because of the subject matter, upscale customers will
watch,'' he said, ``but it will get others who will watch for $3 or
$4 and not $8,'' a typical box office price in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Allen also said she hoped that the film had by now gained
enough distance from the controversies of last winter, when the
writer Barbara Chase-Riboud accused Spielberg of appropriating much
of ``Amistad'' from one of her books and critics complained that
the movie had been misrepresented as a nonfictional account. (Ms.
Chase-Riboud dropped her lawsuit in February.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the storm is over and we'll be looked at differently,''
Ms. Allen said.

   The president has groped a pre-teen-ager, his opponent's
commercials are set to the tune of ``Thank Heaven for Little
Girls'' and damage control is in high gear at the White House under
the direction of the master troubleshooter Conrad Brean (Robert De
Niro). No simple spinmeister, Brean decides to fabricate a crisis
with Albania to deflect the nation's attention. Reaching out to
Hollywood, he enlists the producer Stanley Motss (Dustin Hoffman),
and together they concoct a scenario that makes Barry Levinson's
satire, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, ``as scarily
plausible as it is swift, hilarious and impossible to resist.''

<P>
   The way young Ludovic (Georges DuFresne) explains it, the
chromosome that would have made him female accidentally fell into
the garbage, leaving him as a little boy with a preference for
dresses and an urge to marry the boy next door. But what begins as
a charming eccentricity eventually costs his father his job,
threatens to tear apart his parents' marriage and forces his family
to move from their proper Belgian neighborhood. Fortunately in such
circumstances, Alain Berliner's film avoids pathos and weighty
social commentary to tell a modern fairy tale ``with irresistible
good humor and minimal psychologizing'' (Stephen Holden).

   The Replacement Killers
</P>
<P>
   Antoine Fuqua's film is so sleek that it unrolls like a long
dance record. The Hong Kong action star Chow Yun-Fat and Mira
Sorvino are teamed as a hit man with a conscience and a forger of
passport papers who is comfortable around guns. Add shootings. If a
fusion of ``action-adventure style and cool, Los Angeles street
chic has a certain seductive charm, it is the only charm of a movie
that is otherwise devoid of content'' (Holden).

   Edward Burns moves the Irish-American ambiance of his earlier

Springsteen country in bleakest New Jersey. Plain-as-vanilla
Michael (Jon Bon Jovi) is trying to keep his girlfriend (Lauren
Holly) out of the clutches of her former boyfriend Charlie (Burns),
who's back after a failed try at the big time in Los Angeles. But
in reaching for an epic American sadness, Burns makes the mistake
of employing actors whose own ``prospects look considerably
brighter than the dead-end futures the movie insists on giving
them'' (Holden).

TOP 100 MOVIE LIST RAISES HOWLS IN HOLLYWOOD
</HEADLINE>
  (Advance for Sunday, June 28) 
 (ja) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Where's the brilliant silent clown Buster Keaton?
Where's Garbo? Where are Fred and Ginger? Or the great comedies by
Preston Sturges? Or Ernst Lubitsch's classic films, ``Ninotchka''
and ``Little Shop Around the Corner.''
</P>
<P>
   And what on earth are ``Fargo,'' ``Rocky,'' ``Easy Rider'' and
``Guess Who's Coming to Dinner'' doing on a list of the 100
greatest movies ever made?
</P>
<P>
   Those are some of the questions that have puzzled and distressed
Hollywood during the last week in the aftermath of what many
executives, filmmakers and producers viewed as the flawed and
over-hyped American Film Institute's list of 100 great movies.
There are other issues, too.
</P>
<P>
   Meryl Streep, speaking at a luncheon honoring women in the movie
business, deplored the absence of films on the list with women as
leading protagonists. Curtis Hanson, director of ``L.A.
Confidential'' and a former film critic, said that having only four
titles from the silent era, a period that many film experts
consider the peak of movie-making, as well as other omissions was
unforgivable. ``This list cannot be taken seriously,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a popularity contest,'' he continued, ``which is why it's
so heavily skewed toward movies of recent decades.''
</P>
<P>
   A critic at Variety, the show business newspaper, called the
list ``scholastically challenged.'' Kenneth Turan, the chief film
critic at The Los Angeles Times, said that ``the omissions on the
AFI list, and they are numerous, are frankly a scandal,'' and he
added that the entire exercise was both wasteful and a shame.
</P>
<P>
   And Russell Baker, writing in The New York Times, detailed what
he saw as the numerous films and stars that were ignored, including
Edward G. Robinson and ``Gunga Din,'' the greatest boy's adventure
in movies.
</P>
<P>
   Film institute officials were shaken by the onslaught. The
prestigious organization, which runs a film school and is dedicated
to advancing and preserving movies, initially saw the list as a way
to raise money, especially after financial cuts for the arts in
Washington. The organization teamed with CBS for a three-hour
special on the list, and Newsweek, one of the sponsors of the
television show, published a special issue. The TNT network also
began a series based on the list.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,500 members of the film community, as well as
President Clinton, were asked to select the best 100 films from a
list of 400 prepared by the institute. Orson Welles' ``Citizen
Kane'' (1941) was chosen the best. But the list was so heavy with
contemporary films that Steven Spielberg was the most chosen
director, with five films, and Martin Scorsese had three, an honor
that, as Turan said, may have embarrassed Scorsese, whose grasp of
films is second to none, because so many great films were shut out.
</P>
<P>
   The institute struggled to put the best possible light on the
controversy. Seth Oster, the director of communications for the
group, said the institute welcomed the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It meant that there was a dialogue going on about films that
was being created and fostered by the AFI through this
celebration,'' he said. ``That was our main goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Still. No Buster Keaton movies?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Seeing Double at Disney  &LR;  Nancy Meyers, a veteran writer and
producer of the hit comedies ``Private Benjamin'' (1980), ``Baby
Boom'' (1987) and ``Father of the Bride'' (1991) and its 1995
sequel, didn't think she'd find many surprises in making her
directorial debut in the new and updated Disney family classic,
``The Parent Trap.'' After all, in making her hits, she was on the
set every day and participated in most decisions made by her
longtime partner, Charles Shyer, who directed those movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think I'd be surprised, and I was shocked,'' said Ms.
Meyers. ``When Charles was directing, I slept at night. And I never
slept at night when I was directing. The night was torture. I
worried about everything. From midnight to three, I worried about
the day before. From three to six, I worried about the mistakes I'd
make the next day. I wrote notes in the dark. When I woke up, I
could barely read them.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. The film, which opens on July 29 and stars Dennis
Quaid; Natasha Richardson, who just won a Tony award for
``Cabaret,'' and a newcomer, Lindsay Lohan, in the Hayley Mills
role, has emerged as one of Disney's most anticipated movies of the
summer. The original 1961 movie, which has been extraordinarily
popular among young girls through the years, is about twins, raised
on different continents, who meet at a summer camp in Maine and
devise a scheme to reunite their divorced parents.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved the fact that the children controlled the story line
and pulled all the strings,'' Ms. Meyers said. ``I was, frankly, a
little worried about doing another remake after `Father of the
Bride,' but it finally seemed to me OK. There's a comfort level for
the audience in seeing something they've seen before. The challenge
is to tell the story in your own way. Why are people rushing to see
`Cabaret'? They know it. They want to see this interpretation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meyers said she has wanted to direct for a while, but held
off because the consuming hours would have taken her away from her
two daughters with Shyer. But the girls are now 17 and 10, and Ms.
Meyers felt now was the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the decisions on movies were made by the two of us but,
finally, all the shots and final choices were Charles','' she said.
``At a certain point I said, `I want to have a chance.'''
</P>
<P>
   There are few female directors, and Ms. Meyers was a bit
concerned about dealing with crews that sometimes patronize women
filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were fabulous with me,'' she said. ``They were mostly
young, and they helped me a lot. We have many special effects, and
I was fearful of that. When I met the effects crew, I thought it
would be like car mechanics talking to women, `Oh little lady, let
us worry about these complicated things, you just turn on the key
and push the pedal.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like that at all,'' said Ms. Meyers, who is planning
to direct another film as soon as she can.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Patience, Patience  &LR;  Like any actor, Tony Shalhoub has had his
share of rejection. He would have been delighted, he says, to have
been in the forthcoming Steven Spielberg film, ``Saving Private
Ryan,'' or to have won the Greg Kinnear role in ``As Good as It
Gets.'' Shalhoub said, ``All those roles I tried for _ they're
almost too numerous to mention.''
</P>
<P>
   But Shalhoub isn't too worried. The actor, best known to
audiences as the Italian cab driver, Antonio, in the television
show ``Wings,'' saw his film career take off as the uncompromising
risotto-specialist chef and Stanley Tucci's brother in ``Big
Night.'' Although some roles still elude him, Shalhoub now has a
film being released almost every other month or so through
December.
</P>
<P>
   The 44-year-old actor, who grew up in Green Bay, Wis., earned a
master's degree at the Yale School of Drama and spent four years at
the American Repertory Company in Cambridge, Mass., will appear in,
among other films, ``A Civil Action'' (he plays John Travolta's law
partner); ``Against All Enemies'' (he's an FBI agent with Denzel
Washington), and ``The Imposters,'' a screwball comedy set in the
1930's and directed by Tucci.
</P>
<P>
   Shalhoub, who has spent years working on and off Broadway, said
that probably his most important learning experience as an actor
occurred while he was an undergraduate at the University of Maine
in Portland. He had decided to become an actor and so performed at
children's theaters across the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did a lot of bad work and early experimentation,'' he said
with a laugh. ``The audiences could be very captive and very
disruptive. I got all my humiliations out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that actors can't let rejections shake their confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become somewhat easier for me since I'm married and have
two children and I've shifted my priorities somewhat,'' said
Shalhoub, who met his wife, the actress Brooke Adams, while working
on a Wendy Wasserstein play, ``The Heidi Chronicles.'' The couple
and their children live in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are consumed by the business and their careers so that
rejection can be devastating and the effects can be long-lasting.
It can become an unhealthy way to live. I was like that for years.
I was lucky. I met the right woman.''

`OUT OF SIGHT': A THIEF, A MARSHAL, AN ITEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(th) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the prologue to ``Out of Sight'' George Clooney is seen
robbing a bank. And it's a miracle that the teller doesn't thank
him. As the suavest-looking thief since Cary Grant played cat
burglar on the Riviera, Clooney stares at her meaningfully,
half-smiling, as he sweet-talks his way through the crime.
</P>
<P>
   His character, Jack Foley, is a consummate charmer, but he is
about to meet his match in the voluptuous form of a federal marshal
named Karen Sisco (Jennifer Lopez). As directed with terrific
panache by Steven Soderbergh, these two sultry stars take an
intricate Elmore Leonard crime tale and give it steam heat.
</P>
<P>
   As Leonard told Movieline magazine with typical dead-on
simplicity: ``You put Jennifer Lopez in it, that's going to make it
sexy.'' He should know: it was he who contrived a way to lock Jack
and Karen in a car trunk together before this story even gets
going, and to make the most of their mutual, possibly fatal,
attraction.
</P>
<P>
   It was also Leonard who came up with this book's vivid rogues'
gallery, with a dozen colorful supporting roles that have been cast
here to wicked perfection. The film includes a couple of unbilled
stars and saves its credits for the final reel. This makes for many
a nice surprise as each of these flamboyant minor figures barges
into the story.
</P>
<P>
   For Soderbergh, whose most accessible films have been ``Sex,
Lies and Videotape'' and ``King of the Hill,'' ``Out of Sight'' is
a departure into markedly commercial material. And he makes it work
like a dream.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-boiled beauty of the cinematography (by Elliot Davis,
who has shot three previous Soderbergh films) brings out the
story's own innate color and creates a warmly inviting backdrop for
the central star-crossed romance. The film's sleek moodiness and
visual sophistication are so effective that there's even a scene
here that makes Detroit look like the most romantic city in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The action starts in Florida, where Jack has been jailed after
hitting a glitch during that bank robbery. (The getaway car
wouldn't go.) Feeling correctly that he is not made for prison
life, Jack involves himself in an escape scheme that also involves
Buddy (Ving Rhames), his longtime pal and confidant.
</P>
<P>
   Though everyone in the story has an Achilles' heel, Buddy's is
best: he has a habit of confessing his transgressions to his
sister, who is a nun. And the nun has a habit of turning Buddy in.
</P>
<P>
   It happens that Karen is on assignment near the prison, and when
she sees the breakout, she gets ready to shoot. So Buddy stuffs her
into his car trunk, where Jack is also hidden, and a funny thing
happens: a first date.
</P>
<P>
   Locked in these red-lit close quarters, the two make small talk
about movies and other matters, and each is strangely smitten when
the ride is over. For the rest of this delicately poised story,
Karen daydreams about Mr. Wrong while Jack wonders exactly how
dangerous Karen is to his health.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Get Shorty,'' ``Out of Sight'' has been adapted with
deftness and fidelity by Scott Frank, who knows exactly how to
translate Leonard's narrative voice to the screen. This is not an
attention-getting feat, since both films so smoothly resemble the
books on which they are based, but it's much subtler than it may
appear.
</P>
<P>
   Frank works in all the requisite smart lines and small nuances,
and the story has been modified only where it needed changing most:
in a climactic crime sequence that sent the novel off on a
nihilistic note. Without sacrificing this episode, the film manages
to end with a fine little cameo appearance and a secret smile.
</P>
<P>
   The film's major supporting performers, including Don Cheadle,
Albert Brooks, Steve Zahn and Isaiah Washington, are uniformly
savvy. (For the sake of surprise, let's leave it at that.)
</P>
<P>
   And the movie benefits from presenting more of an ethnic mix
than the book did. The formerly blond and coltish Karen, for
instance, now looks like a younger sister to Jackie Brown. Ms.
Lopez has her best movie role thus far, and she brings it both
seductiveness and grit; if it was hard to imagine a hard-working,
pistol-packing bombshell on the page, it couldn't be easier here.
</P>
<P>
   The casting of Clooney also departs from the book, since Jack
Foley on the page is seasoned and sad-eyed, reminding other
characters of Harry Dean Stanton. Clooney, who like Ms. Lopez makes
the most of a splendid opportunity here, won't be reminding anyone
of Stanton at all. Soderbergh plays some graceful time tricks with
these two by sometimes letting their daydreams anticipate their
long-overdue real romance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of Sight'' relies on top-flight technical contributions
from the production designer Gary Frutkoff (who did ``Devil in a
Blue Dress''), the editor Anne Coates (who won an Oscar for
``Lawrence of Arabia'') and the costume designer Betsy Heimann.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Heimann's like-minded credits include ``Get Shorty,''
``Reservoir Dogs,'' ``Jerry Maguire'' and ``Pulp Fiction,'' and one
of her main contributions to posterity may be putting Ms. Lopez in
a black leather trench coat here.
</P>
<P>
   This film winds up as reminiscent of ``Pulp Fiction'' as it is
of other first-rate Elmore Leonard adaptations, what with its big
cast, bold use of color and generally hip, wary tone. The
production company Jersey Films (``Reality Bites,'' ``Pulp
Fiction,'' ``Get Shorty,'' ``Gattaca'') once again shows off its
shrewd cutting edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of Sight'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying
parent or adult guardian). It includes profanity, violence and
sexual situations staged without nudity.
</P>

GORE PROMOTES BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT IN INNER CITIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 28)   (EDs: Filed in Washington, ``w,'' and Financial, ``f,''
categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the face of congressional opposition to its
urban agenda, the Clinton administration is finding other ways to
fulfill its vision of bringing jobs and development to hard-pressed
inner-city neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   At a little-noticed White House meeting June 5, Vice President
Al Gore hosted chief executives of nine corporations that already
have invested heavily in building commercial enterprises in
poverty-stricken areas. Each used the meeting to make commitments
to major expansions.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, the White House Business and Entrepreneurial
Roundtable on Community Empowerment, marked a turning point in the
often tenuous relationship between businesses and impoverished
urban neighborhoods. During the riots of the 1960s, images of
looting and burning convinced many retailers and manufacturers to
shift investments to upscale neighborhoods, suburbia or industrial
zones far from cities. A significant number of urban areas became
wastelands with few, if any, jobs or amenities.
</P>
<P>
   However, with the economy improving and urban unemployment down,
executives and government leaders gradually are coming to view
these same neighborhoods as opportunities. At the meeting, Gore
equated investment in impoverished neighborhoods with good business
sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``By working in partnership with the private sector, we can make
our communities and our nation stronger and more competitive,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Henry McKinnell, head of New York-based Pfizer Inc.'s
pharmaceuticals group, said his company would develop a
supermarket, low- and moderate-income housing, and expand a school
and industrial space on land it owns near its original and
still-operating Brooklyn plant.
</P>
<P>
   And Martin Grass, chief executive of Rite Aid Corp. in Camp
Hill, Pa., pledged to open 40 new drugstores over the next two
years in economically depressed urban areas nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful symbiotic relationship,'' said Suzanne Mead,
Rite Aid's vice president for corporate communications. ``We invest
in the community and in return we are able to increase our sales.
And our growth actually helps benefit the community because we
employ local people, and we buy products and services from local
vendors.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 1999 budget, Clinton called for an ambitious effort to
make inner cities more business friendly. He asked Congress to
spend $400 million to establish a new Community Empowerment Fund,
which officials said would spur about $2 billion in private
investment and create 280,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The administration also wants to spend $1.5 billion to expand
empowerment zones, where businesses receive tax breaks for
investments in defined urban areas. Also, Clinton proposed adding
an extra $50 million to the ``brownfields'' effort to clean up
polluted urban sites, and provide $283 million in rental assistance
to families moving from welfare to work.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican congressional aides say new programs and
expansions of old ones are unlikely to get past the GOP-controlled
Congress, especially with the demise of a cigarette tax increase
that was the centerpiece of tobacco legislation. Clinton was
counting on that money to fund $10 billion in domestic social
spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can assume the likelihood on most of these proposals is
nil,'' said one Republican aide, who asked not to be
identified..MDRV/.MDNM/
</P>
<P>
   One exception, aides said, is Clinton's proposal on rental
vouchers for welfare-to-work families. Republicans are likely to
support a modified version, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is to empower people and help pay their rent,''
said another Republican aide. ``That's the most we can
realistically do in this budget environment.''
</P>
<P>
   With the nation's economy humming along, many cities that
languished in the 1970s and 1980s are in the midst of a remarkable
comeback. Now that crime is down, New York is a tourist mecca. And
even old industrial cities such as Cleveland and Baltimore have
attracted business and tourism with ambitious downtown
redevelopment projects.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment in cities averaged 5.3 percent in March. In March
1993, the rate was 8.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But problems persist. The exodus of middle-class families
continues, with six million middle-income families leaving inner
cities since 1970. Unemployment rates for minority youth in central
cities average 26 percent, five times higher than the overall
unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's answer is a host of bully-pulpit efforts
such as Gore's business roundtable that do not require
congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   However, in calling for increased inner-city business
investment, the administration is placing itself atop a wave
already rolling to shore, said Bruce Katz of the Brookings
Institution, an independent Washington-based think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Katz, an urban specialist who served in Clinton's first term as
an official at the Department of Housing and Urban Development,
gave the administration high marks for stimulating the urban
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Katz said, ``the vice president didn't manufacture
these commitments. The corporations aren't doing this out of
charity. They're doing it because they know they can profit.''
</P>
<P>
   Such investments, Katz added, represent a better-late-than-never
recognition that contrary to the general perception that poor urban
dwellers have little disposable income, ``these neighborhoods have
long been under-served by retail.''

SUBTLY DISGUISED, DANCE SLIPS BACK TO BROADWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dance fans at more than one Broadway show this summer
might feel like the protagonist of Moliere's ``Bourgeois
Gentilhomme,'' who was unaware that he was speaking ``prose.''
</P>
<P>
   Audiences might be surprised to learn how much choreography runs
through musicals that resemble anything but the standard
dance-driven show. A closer look would show that dance can go
beyond the time-honored integrated number that advances the plot.
Dance is there, whether we know it or not.
</P>
<P>
   How, for instance, can one separate Garth Fagan's spectacular
rhythmic processionals and anthropomorphic dances from the action
as a whole in ``The Lion King''? The entire show dances.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone caught on at first; it took a Tony Award for best
choreography to Fagan to give him Broadway's seal of approval. His
contribution was so subtle, albeit brilliant, that even experienced
dancegoers did not recognize a dance sequence when they saw it.
</P>
<P>
   But musicals now on Broadway rarely offer the old set pieces,
and the idea that dance furthers the action is even harder to spot.
Again, can one separate song from dance in Ann Reinking's
super-polished staging of ``Chicago''? Dance is visible here but it
is glued to the songs it enhances and vice versa. Neither would
make sense without the other in this current version.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Cabaret,'' star performances from Natasha Richardson
and Alan Cumming may conceal how much choreography weaves through
the show. But where would the piercing, aggressive tone of this
revisionist production be without the insidious bump-and-grind
images that Rob Marshall, significantly co-director (with Sam
Mendes) as well as choreographer, uses to stylize the show so
shrewdly?
</P>
<P>
   Most of these musicals play by relatively new rules. One says
``relatively'' because even ``Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme'' can be
seen as an antecedent. Moliere's 17th-century comedy was termed a
comedie-ballet and was a new hybrid form. Neither just a play nor
just a ballet, it integrated music and dance into dramatic
structure, a witty entertainment fit for a king: Louis XIV.
</P>
<P>
   What is fit for the ticket buyer in New York does not fall into
one category. This might not be the best season for dance in
Broadway musicals, but it signals an innovative approach that banks
on a hybrid genre of its own. This is why the boundaries between
dance and other elements in each musical are not clearly defined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bring In da Noise, Bring In da Funk'' is a sterling example.
What looks like a tap-dancing show is actually a dramatic conceit
in which tap becomes a vocabulary to tell a story. At the other end
is ``Rent,'' in which the dance component appears minimal but
contributes the vernacular energy essential to the musical's tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicago,'' ``The Lion King,'' ``Cabaret,'' ``Rent'' and
``Bring In da Noise'' are experimental productions. In between,
there is conventional show dancing with period flavor, seen to
blockbuster effect in ``Ragtime,'' but with blander results in
``High Society.'' Graciela Daniele's choreography for ``Ragtime''
is a model of professionalism, but even these two shows are led by
singers, not singer-dancers. No Ray Bolger or Chita Rivera here.
</P>
<P>
   A view of dance as a creative medium is what most of these shows
offer those who remember that Broadway musicals, before Andrew
Lloyd Webber, were song (italics)and(end italics) dance shows.
</P>
<P>
   Dance on Broadway made a comeback in 1992 but is now seen in a
new guise. A pastiche of older styles, common in revivals like
``Show Boat'' a few years ago, is mainly out. In ``Chicago'' and
``Cabaret,'' dance is used to comment on the original productions.
</P>
<P>
   Their current choreographers are less concerned with reproducing
authentic dances of the 1920's and 30's than with creating a gloss
on the ``Cabaret'' of Joel Grey and the ``Chicago'' that
telegraphed Bob Fosse's choreographic style to the world.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Reinking's choreography comments on Fosse's work. Marshall's
burlesque-house entertainers in ``Cabaret'' say less about the
Germany in which his dances are set than about restylizing a
musical for today. One could complain just a few years ago that
virtually all musicals were about the past, even ``Tommy'' and
``Grease.'' Where was the counterpart of ``West Side Story,''
written in the 1950s about the 1950s?
</P>
<P>
   ``Rent'' was the reply, a look at aspiring artists on the Lower
East Side in a time of AIDS. ``The Lion King,'' for all its
fantasy-filled animal kingdom, and ``Bring In da Noise'' are also
streetwise shows imbued with a hip-hop influence. Their dances
borrow from the street.
</P>
<P>
   Dance on Broadway today is not identified with a superstar
choreographer like Jerome Robbins, who influenced the art form for
decades. Whether this is a weakness or not, many choreographers
tailor their styles to specific shows, even to the point of
submerging dance into an organic whole, as a selective overview of
the following musicals suggests.
</P>
<P>
   `Cabaret'
</P>
<P>
   The sinister, as opposed to merely decadent, atmosphere of
Berlin's Kit Kat Klub in this revisionist production owes much to
the invidious slink of its denizens. Rob Marshall, the
choreographer, keeps the nightclub entertainers on the move and in
Cumming, the master of ceremonies, he has an actor with the
physical agility of a remarkable mime.
</P>
<P>
   Still, women in underwear and torn hose who squat in a deep plie
and a crotch-clutching compere will soon suggest that
pelvis-swiveling variations on basic bump-and-grind can go only so
far.
</P>
<P>
   Where Marshall succeeds is in using dance and stylized movement
to evoke a general emotional state. Virtually everyone is a victim
in this production, which ends with Cumming's snapping into a
cruciform pose in concentration camp uniform, identified as a Jew
and homosexual by the gold star and pink triangle pinned on his
chest.
</P>
<P>
   For all its intended shock value, this ending has been implied
all along. No one, including the folk who turn into Nazis
overnight, has a bright future, and as the female entertainers
slither into sexually provocative poses or grovel on the floor for
money, toughness becomes equated with mere tawdriness.
</P>
<P>
   There is a message in the movement. As the Nazis rise to power,
all that writhing on the floor suggests a willingness to submit, in
more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
   `Chicago'
</P>
<P>
   Fosse's pelvis-popping choreography is reinvented by Ms.
Reinking in a vibrant geometric style that suits this minimalist
concert staging, which originated with the ``Encores'' series at
City Center.
</P>
<P>
   The black costumes by William Ivey Long are functional in the
best sense. The performers stand out in relief against the band
behind them. There is less of a hard edge to the movement than one
might expect from a Fosse star and disciple, but that is because
the show is more brassy than sordid in this rendition.

GORE PROMOTES BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT IN INNER CITIES

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the face of congressional opposition to its
urban agenda, the Clinton administration is finding other ways to
fulfill its vision of bringing jobs and development to hard-pressed
inner-city neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   At a little-noticed White House meeting June 5, Vice President
Al Gore hosted chief executives of nine corporations that already
have invested heavily in building commercial enterprises in
poverty-stricken areas. Each used the meeting to make commitments
to major expansions.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, the White House Business and Entrepreneurial
Roundtable on Community Empowerment, marked a turning point in the
often tenuous relationship between businesses and impoverished
urban neighborhoods. During the riots of the 1960s, images of
looting and burning convinced many retailers and manufacturers to
shift investments to upscale neighborhoods, suburbia or industrial
zones far from cities. A significant number of urban areas became
wastelands with few, if any, jobs or amenities.
</P>
<P>
   However, with the economy improving and urban unemployment down,
executives and government leaders gradually are coming to view
these same neighborhoods as opportunities. At the meeting, Gore
equated investment in impoverished neighborhoods with good business
sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``By working in partnership with the private sector, we can make
our communities and our nation stronger and more competitive,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Henry McKinnell, head of New York-based Pfizer Inc.'s
pharmaceuticals group, said his company would develop a
supermarket, low- and moderate-income housing, and expand a school
and industrial space on land it owns near its original and
still-operating Brooklyn plant.
</P>
<P>
   And Martin Grass, chief executive of Rite Aid Corp. in Camp
Hill, Pa., pledged to open 40 new drugstores over the next two
years in economically depressed urban areas nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful symbiotic relationship,'' said Suzanne Mead,
Rite Aid's vice president for corporate communications. ``We invest
in the community and in return we are able to increase our sales.
And our growth actually helps benefit the community because we
employ local people, and we buy products and services from local
vendors.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 1999 budget, Clinton called for an ambitious effort to
make inner cities more business friendly. He asked Congress to
spend $400 million to establish a new Community Empowerment Fund,
which officials said would spur about $2 billion in private
investment and create 280,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The administration also wants to spend $1.5 billion to expand
empowerment zones, where businesses receive tax breaks for
investments in defined urban areas. Also, Clinton proposed adding
an extra $50 million to the ``brownfields'' effort to clean up
polluted urban sites, and provide $283 million in rental assistance
to families moving from welfare to work.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican congressional aides say new programs and
expansions of old ones are unlikely to get past the GOP-controlled
Congress, especially with the demise of a cigarette tax increase
that was the centerpiece of tobacco legislation. Clinton was
counting on that money to fund $10 billion in domestic social
spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can assume the likelihood on most of these proposals is
nil,'' said one Republican aide, who asked not to be
identified..MDRV/.MDNM/
</P>
<P>
   One exception, aides said, is Clinton's proposal on rental
vouchers for welfare-to-work families. Republicans are likely to
support a modified version, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is to empower people and help pay their rent,''
said another Republican aide. ``That's the most we can
realistically do in this budget environment.''
</P>
<P>
   With the nation's economy humming along, many cities that
languished in the 1970s and 1980s are in the midst of a remarkable
comeback. Now that crime is down, New York is a tourist mecca. And
even old industrial cities such as Cleveland and Baltimore have
attracted business and tourism with ambitious downtown
redevelopment projects.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment in cities averaged 5.3 percent in March. In March
1993, the rate was 8.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But problems persist. The exodus of middle-class families
continues, with six million middle-income families leaving inner
cities since 1970. Unemployment rates for minority youth in central
cities average 26 percent, five times higher than the overall
unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's answer is a host of bully-pulpit efforts
such as Gore's business roundtable that do not require
congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   However, in calling for increased inner-city business
investment, the administration is placing itself atop a wave
already rolling to shore, said Bruce Katz of the Brookings
Institution, an independent Washington-based think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Katz, an urban specialist who served in Clinton's first term as
an official at the Department of Housing and Urban Development,
gave the administration high marks for stimulating the urban
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Katz said, ``the vice president didn't manufacture
these commitments. The corporations aren't doing this out of
charity. They're doing it because they know they can profit.''
</P>
<P>
   Such investments, Katz added, represent a better-late-than-never
recognition that contrary to the general perception that poor urban
dwellers have little disposable income, ``these neighborhoods have
long been under-served by retail.''

 NEW YORK: this rendition.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ms. Reinking, in the starring role, has been replaced by Karen
Ziemba as Roxie Hart, the aspiring vaudeville star on trial for
murdering her lover. Velma Kelly, her jail-house rival, was played
by Mamie Duncan-Gibbs last week when Bebe Neuwirth was temporarily
absent from the show.
</P>
<P>
   If the two leading roles were created for star dancers who can
sing, the choreography is so solid and so inclusive of its dynamic
ensemble that the dancing has a built-in impact, no matter who
leads.
</P>
<P>
   The idiom is stylized jazz dance, two generations down from Jack
Cole, Fosse's mentor and the pioneer of jazz dance on Broadway and
in Hollywood. Jazz dance is not reticent; it implies a hard sell,
and Ms. Reinking concentrates on what Martha Graham called ``The
House of Pelvic Truth,'' the lower body. It is all sexy but in this
version, never sardonic.
</P>
<P>
   `The Lion King'
</P>
<P>
   Garth Fagan, one of modern dance's most innovative
choreographers, has brought something new to Broadway in his
collaboration with Julie Taymor, the show's director. Rarely has
dancing been integrated so fully into stage action to create a
spectacle in the truest sense.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the stage version of ``Beauty and the Beast,'' the Walt
Disney Co.'s first Broadway musical, Disney's ``Lion King'' does
not duplicate the cartoon images of the animated film on which it
is based. The choreography has its own vision and is, in fact,
visionary.
</P>
<P>
   The story of a lion cub's rite of passage takes place in an
animal kingdom and, thanks to Fagan, all the flora and fauna enter
into the dance. The grasslands are symbolized by trays of grass
atop the swaying performers; a fierce stampede of beasts is an
African warrior dance in disguise.
</P>
<P>
   With all their human characteristics, the animals reveal their
personalities through dance. The nasty hyenas are street toughs who
have a break-dance routine. By contrast, the hunt by the lionesses
is embodied in fleet leaps across the stage in pursuit of graceful
gazelles.
</P>
<P>
   In the dazzling opening processional, there is an introduction
to the distinctive rhythms and gaits that Fagan gives animal
groups, each moving in counterpoint to another.
</P>
<P>
   Served by a committed cast that is rendered anonymous under its
masks and headdresses, he offers a remarkable achievement: in true
ritual fashion, he has the dancer identify with the mask. The
imagination soars.
</P>
<P>
   `Ragtime'
</P>
<P>
   The dancing and choreography here is the kind that Europeans
consider a specifically American marvel. In a musical that attempts
to distill E.L. Doctorow's panoramic novel of America in the
century's first decade, Ms. Daniele skillfully boils the essence of
several ethnic groups down to archetypes or stereotypes, depending
on your view.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants, blacks and suburban whites are defined through
choreography that expresses character. There are some cliches, but
there are also exuberant evocations of a period: a boardwalk band
that freezes in silhouette, a machine dance that recalls an
assembly line.
</P>
<P>
   A new industrial America in which class and ethnic distinctions
will yield to mobility and money is described conventionally but
with admirable fluency in these dances.
</P>
<P>
   `High Society'
</P>
<P>
   Lar Lubovitch, one of the country's major modern dance
choreographers, is listed as the musical's official choreographer,
although Wayne Cilento, another choreographer, and Des McAnuff, a
director, were reportedly brought in to make final revisions.
</P>
<P>
   The dancing is used conventionally to hurry the plot along, but
there is also a welcome acerbic tinge that could have been
developed further. The spicy touch comes from the servants who
comment on the mores of a high-society household, descended from
Philip Barry's play ``The Philadelphia Story'' and the 1956 film
musical ``High Society.''
</P>
<P>
   As is common with an upstairs-downstairs situation, the servants
are pictured as more snobbish than their employers. Their
snootiness comes through in their straight-back stiffness and
disciplined movement patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Except for some negligible ballroom dances for the other
characters, the choreography consists of permutations of cumulative
gestures for the household staff. Anyone familiar with minimalist
works in experimental dance will know where the inspiration comes
from.
</P>
<P>
   `Rent' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `Bring in da Noise, Bring in da Funk'
</P>
<P>
   These long-running hits touch a nerve, in part because their
young casts move onstage the way people move on the street.
</P>
<P>
   Marlies Yearby, the choreographer for ``Rent,'' is not required
to define the East Village subculture onstage with a big production
number. It is all a matter of theatricalizing natural gesture to a
rock beat. There is a mock tango, but for all its sad retelling of
the opera ``La Boheme,'' ``Rent'' is full of disco and hip-hop
rhythms, channeled into overall exuberance.
</P>
<P>
   Savion Glover, the choreographer and original star of ``Bring in
da Noise,'' took tap into a new dimension with a multilevel
exploration of a dance idiom. History _ America, blacks and tap _
is the subject. But the show is also about the new style that
Glover has developed in his brilliant dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Baakari Wilder, the virtuoso who took over Glover's role, has
the same kind of deceptive nonchalance. The footwork is emphatic
and grounded. The upper body looks relaxed: tap dancing from a new
generation.

`SIDE MAN': MEMORY PLAY GROWS DEEPER IN NEW PRODUCTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For evidence of how actors, given time and devotion,
can grow in their roles, look no further than ``Side Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren Leight's powerfully unsettling memory play has moved from
Off Broadway to the Roundabout Theater, where it reopened Thursday
night, and where it has acquired the ineffable quality of something
deeper, more penetrating.
</P>
<P>
   The memories dramatized here are those of Clifford (Robert
Sella), a man recalling a treacherous childhood spent in the
company of emotionally untrustworthy parents, and the itinerant
jazz musicians whose world they all shared. It's an enormously
moving play about the pleasure of music making, but also about the
end of music, music that defined a way of life and filled a boy's
heart. What happens when the music stops is so sad, it may have you
in tears.
</P>
<P>
   Under the sensitive direction of Michael Mayer, who with ``A
View From the Bridge'' demonstrated a lively intuition for the
dramatic currents in postwar working-class America, ``Side Man,''
set in the same period, demands that attention be paid to Leight's
marginal people and their carelessly arranged lives. Part situation
comedy, part wistful family drama, the play occasionally gets stuck
in idle, especially toward the meandering end of the first act.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, though, ``Side Man'' is vindicated by the pure
feeling it arouses and the wonderful, true-to-life characters it
depicts, each as pain-wracked and joyful as the blues.
</P>
<P>
   The play has not been appreciably altered in the transfer to
Broadway. If anything, it looks and sounds better than in its
earlier incarnation this spring at the Classic Stage Company's
theater on East 13th Street. Neil Patel's moody, impressionistic
set and Kenneth Posner's blazingly effective lighting gain in
personality on a larger stage; Posner's spectacular design for the
play's centerpiece scene, in which three jazz musicians swoon
silently to the recording of an intoxicating trumpet solo, is an
example of how a light board can illuminate the soul.
</P>
<P>
   The cast, save one actress in a central role, remains the same,
and the performances have transferred even more successfully than
the trappings. The portrayals are looser and more fluid, flowing
more freely into the nooks and crannies of the characters'
idiosyncrasies. This crisper attack is most profound in the work of
Michael Mastro, Joseph Lyle Taylor and Kevin Geer, who play the
roguish trio of musicians who share gigs and unemployment with
Clifford's father, Gene (Frank Wood); think of a Scarecrow on bass,
a Tin Man on drums and a Cowardly Lion on horn.
</P>
<P>
   Mastro, in particular, is a comic wiz as Ziggy, a jazz nerd in
horn-rimmed glasses who doesn't allow his speech impediment to get
in the way of a good riposte. His sharp comebacks are in the best
wise-guy tradition of Bob Hope's road movies. Angelica Torn,
playing a hot-blooded waitress with a short-order philosophy about
romance, makes an even warmer impression than she did downtown;
she's the mother Clifford should have had.
</P>
<P>
   ``Side Man'' counts on these accomplished players for comic
relief. ``What do you do when an ex-junkie compliments you on your
veins?'' Clifford asks us after the goateed Geer peruses Clifford's
arm and exclaims, ``Nice rope!'' In such moments, the play
authentically captures the language and customs of the breed of
jazzmen who reigned in nightclubs in the 1950s and early '60s. But
it is a feeling of letdown, not uplift, that dominates the play, in
the story of the declining fortunes of these men, and the breakdown
of the marriage of Clifford's parents.
</P>
<P>
   Music is the connective force among the stories, the force that
binds the jazzmen even as it destroys the family. Gene, the nearly
invisible father, more wedded to his beloved horn than to his wife,
Terry (Wendy Makkena), drives her to drink and the brink of madness
with his inattention.
</P>
<P>
   The enigmatic Gene is Leight's most original creation, the one
he named the play for. Gene is by trade a side man, the sort of
all-around musician who can fill any role required of him and his
trumpet. That someone so solidly designed for backup could lend so
little in his domestic life is the tragic dimension of ``Side
Man.'' Gene remains in the background, a position that works for
him in a jazz combo, where contributions are meant to mix, but is a
miserable role for a husband and father. It's left by default to
Clifford to raise himself, and, impossibly, to try to impose some
order on his lost parents.
</P>
<P>
   Moving forward and back in time _ the play spans the years 1953
to 1985 _ Clifford relates the story of his family on the day of a
reunion with his father after years of noncommunication.
(Estrangement is too strong a term to apply to such a passive
relationship.) Sella narrates with an almost stoic detachment that
belies Clifford's pent-up anger, but it's a neutral posture that
befits his predicament. Clifford doesn't choose sides in this war
because neither, he knows, is a winning one.
</P>
<P>
   Sella is now a stronger, more affecting presence in the
difficult role of narrator; his character is at once open and
remote: definitely his father's son. As other cast members,
particularly Ms. Torn and Ms. Makkena, do, he time-travels
adroitly, applying and stripping away his character's years. And
he's a touchingly tentative 10-year-old, trying to keep peace in
the household by slipping his father a few dollars to buy his
mother some liquor, or trying to emulate his father by
shadow-trumpeting to a jazz LP with him. Shadows are all he gets to
see.

 NEW YORK: to see.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ms. Makkena, the newcomer in the cast, replacing the superb Edie
Falco, who had other professional commitments, has a tough
assignment, too. Terry is a hysteric who is seen mostly in stages
of rage, furious at the hoax of a marriage into which she has
fooled herself. Though too quick to shrillness in her tirade
scenes, she's lovely in the quiet moments of Terry's youth and old
age, before and after Gene's terrible blankness smothers the
gentler aspects of her nature.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Wood, who finds some far-away island in his
imagination and takes about three-quarters of his attention there.
It's an artfully distracted performance _ he really does appear to
hear the beat of that different drummer _ that makes Gene's
disregard for anything but the music seem a virtue. Benign neglect
rarely looks so forgivable.
</P>
<P>
   Leight's subtle character-driven work is an anomaly on Broadway,
the sort that Tony voters rarely get a look at anymore. The event
here is simply the excellent writing and the equally memorable
acting and stagecraft. Good for the Roundabout for recognizing a
tide, and swimming in the other direction.

TOP 100 MOVIE LIST RAISES HOWLS IN HOLLYWOOD
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Fixes code to reflect Friday release, sted Sunday)   (ja) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Where's the brilliant silent clown Buster Keaton?
Where's Garbo? Where are Fred and Ginger? Or the great comedies by
Preston Sturges? Or Ernst Lubitsch's classic films, ``Ninotchka''
and ``Little Shop Around the Corner.''
</P>
<P>
   And what on earth are ``Fargo,'' ``Rocky,'' ``Easy Rider'' and
``Guess Who's Coming to Dinner'' doing on a list of the 100
greatest movies ever made?
</P>
<P>
   Those are some of the questions that have puzzled and distressed
Hollywood during the last week in the aftermath of what many
executives, filmmakers and producers viewed as the flawed and
over-hyped American Film Institute's list of 100 great movies.
There are other issues, too.
</P>
<P>
   Meryl Streep, speaking at a luncheon honoring women in the movie
business, deplored the absence of films on the list with women as
leading protagonists. Curtis Hanson, director of ``L.A.
Confidential'' and a former film critic, said that having only four
titles from the silent era, a period that many film experts
consider the peak of movie-making, as well as other omissions was
unforgivable. ``This list cannot be taken seriously,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a popularity contest,'' he continued, ``which is why it's
so heavily skewed toward movies of recent decades.''
</P>
<P>
   A critic at Variety, the show business newspaper, called the
list ``scholastically challenged.'' Kenneth Turan, the chief film
critic at The Los Angeles Times, said that ``the omissions on the
AFI list, and they are numerous, are frankly a scandal,'' and he
added that the entire exercise was both wasteful and a shame.
</P>
<P>
   And Russell Baker, writing in The New York Times, detailed what
he saw as the numerous films and stars that were ignored, including
Edward G. Robinson and ``Gunga Din,'' the greatest boy's adventure
in movies.
</P>
<P>
   Film institute officials were shaken by the onslaught. The
prestigious organization, which runs a film school and is dedicated
to advancing and preserving movies, initially saw the list as a way
to raise money, especially after financial cuts for the arts in
Washington. The organization teamed with CBS for a three-hour
special on the list, and Newsweek, one of the sponsors of the
television show, published a special issue. The TNT network also
began a series based on the list.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,500 members of the film community, as well as
President Clinton, were asked to select the best 100 films from a
list of 400 prepared by the institute. Orson Welles' ``Citizen
Kane'' (1941) was chosen the best. But the list was so heavy with
contemporary films that Steven Spielberg was the most chosen
director, with five films, and Martin Scorsese had three, an honor
that, as Turan said, may have embarrassed Scorsese, whose grasp of
films is second to none, because so many great films were shut out.
</P>
<P>
   The institute struggled to put the best possible light on the
controversy. Seth Oster, the director of communications for the
group, said the institute welcomed the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It meant that there was a dialogue going on about films that
was being created and fostered by the AFI through this
celebration,'' he said. ``That was our main goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Still. No Buster Keaton movies?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Seeing Double at Disney  &LR;  Nancy Meyers, a veteran writer and
producer of the hit comedies ``Private Benjamin'' (1980), ``Baby
Boom'' (1987) and ``Father of the Bride'' (1991) and its 1995
sequel, didn't think she'd find many surprises in making her
directorial debut in the new and updated Disney family classic,
``The Parent Trap.'' After all, in making her hits, she was on the
set every day and participated in most decisions made by her
longtime partner, Charles Shyer, who directed those movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think I'd be surprised, and I was shocked,'' said Ms.
Meyers. ``When Charles was directing, I slept at night. And I never
slept at night when I was directing. The night was torture. I
worried about everything. From midnight to three, I worried about
the day before. From three to six, I worried about the mistakes I'd
make the next day. I wrote notes in the dark. When I woke up, I
could barely read them.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. The film, which opens on July 29 and stars Dennis
Quaid; Natasha Richardson, who just won a Tony award for
``Cabaret,'' and a newcomer, Lindsay Lohan, in the Hayley Mills
role, has emerged as one of Disney's most anticipated movies of the
summer. The original 1961 movie, which has been extraordinarily
popular among young girls through the years, is about twins, raised
on different continents, who meet at a summer camp in Maine and
devise a scheme to reunite their divorced parents.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved the fact that the children controlled the story line
and pulled all the strings,'' Ms. Meyers said. ``I was, frankly, a
little worried about doing another remake after `Father of the
Bride,' but it finally seemed to me OK. There's a comfort level for
the audience in seeing something they've seen before. The challenge
is to tell the story in your own way. Why are people rushing to see
`Cabaret'? They know it. They want to see this interpretation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meyers said she has wanted to direct for a while, but held
off because the consuming hours would have taken her away from her
two daughters with Shyer. But the girls are now 17 and 10, and Ms.
Meyers felt now was the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the decisions on movies were made by the two of us but,
finally, all the shots and final choices were Charles','' she said.
``At a certain point I said, `I want to have a chance.'''
</P>
<P>
   There are few female directors, and Ms. Meyers was a bit
concerned about dealing with crews that sometimes patronize women
filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were fabulous with me,'' she said. ``They were mostly
young, and they helped me a lot. We have many special effects, and
I was fearful of that. When I met the effects crew, I thought it
would be like car mechanics talking to women, `Oh little lady, let
us worry about these complicated things, you just turn on the key
and push the pedal.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like that at all,'' said Ms. Meyers, who is planning
to direct another film as soon as she can.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Patience, Patience  &LR;  Like any actor, Tony Shalhoub has had his
share of rejection. He would have been delighted, he says, to have
been in the forthcoming Steven Spielberg film, ``Saving Private
Ryan,'' or to have won the Greg Kinnear role in ``As Good as It
Gets.'' Shalhoub said, ``All those roles I tried for _ they're
almost too numerous to mention.''
</P>
<P>
   But Shalhoub isn't too worried. The actor, best known to
audiences as the Italian cab driver, Antonio, in the television
show ``Wings,'' saw his film career take off as the uncompromising
risotto-specialist chef and Stanley Tucci's brother in ``Big
Night.'' Although some roles still elude him, Shalhoub now has a
film being released almost every other month or so through
December.
</P>
<P>
   The 44-year-old actor, who grew up in Green Bay, Wis., earned a
master's degree at the Yale School of Drama and spent four years at
the American Repertory Company in Cambridge, Mass., will appear in,
among other films, ``A Civil Action'' (he plays John Travolta's law
partner); ``Against All Enemies'' (he's an FBI agent with Denzel
Washington), and ``The Imposters,'' a screwball comedy set in the
1930's and directed by Tucci.
</P>
<P>
   Shalhoub, who has spent years working on and off Broadway, said
that probably his most important learning experience as an actor
occurred while he was an undergraduate at the University of Maine
in Portland. He had decided to become an actor and so performed at
children's theaters across the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did a lot of bad work and early experimentation,'' he said
with a laugh. ``The audiences could be very captive and very
disruptive. I got all my humiliations out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that actors can't let rejections shake their confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become somewhat easier for me since I'm married and have
two children and I've shifted my priorities somewhat,'' said
Shalhoub, who met his wife, the actress Brooke Adams, while working
on a Wendy Wasserstein play, ``The Heidi Chronicles.'' The couple
and their children live in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are consumed by the business and their careers so that
rejection can be devastating and the effects can be long-lasting.
It can become an unhealthy way to live. I was like that for years.
I was lucky. I met the right woman.''

ANTIQUES: MODERNISM WITH A BIT OF HERESY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas., Minn.)   (bl)  
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who studied art history in college will remember H.W.
Janson's ``History of Art,'' the bible in the field for more than
three decades. In it, Janson explains what makes 20th-century
architecture distinctive: ``Modernism means aversion to decoration
for its own sake, without a trace of historicism. It favors clean
functionalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Janson devotees will be provoked by an exhibition that opened at
the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas, this week and runs
through Sept. 13. The show, ``Modernism: The Art of Design,
1880-1940,'' includes nearly 200 of the 450 pieces of decorative
arts collected by the Norwest Bank in Minneapolis since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   There are elaborate William Morris wallpaper sheets from the
1870s that depict trellises and bowers of flowers, as packed with
vegetation and as intricate as any Iznik tile. There are Alfonso
Maria Mucha's sinewy ``Flowers'' posters of 1897. There is what may
be the most lyrical bronze-plated cast-iron bank teller grill ever
designed, a tour de force by the draftsman George Grant Elmslie for
Louis H. Sullivan's National Farmers Bank, a 1908 masterpiece in
Owatonna, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   This is modernism? What happened to the Bauhaus boys: Breuer,
Mies and Gropius?
</P>
<P>
   Proving that modernism started in 1880 is one of the points of
the exhibition, which was organized by David Ryan, the curator of
collections for Norwest Corp. He was the director of the Museum of
Modern Art in Fort Worth in the late 1970s and early '80s and went
to Norwest almost by accident.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled that he was invited to go to Minneapolis to see
Cesar Pelli's new 57-story office tower for Norwest in 1987, before
the building was completed. ``I was asked to kick the tires and
look at the building to see how it might be used to show art,'' he
said. ``There was not a lot of attention being devoted to how to
decorate the halls. There were high, light-filled spaces but we
didn't want to apply artworks as decals.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested starting what is still probably the only corporate
collection devoted to modern decorative and applied arts. The bank
agreed and he was retained to assemble a group of objects that
reflects design reform after 1870.
</P>
<P>
   He admits there is confusion over the terms modern, moderne,
modernist, modernism and contemporary as applied to the arts, but
for him modernism means simply the conviction to move away from
historicism and the pastiche of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Using this as his criterion, Ryan began collecting from six
distinct movements: the British and American Arts and Crafts
(1875-1915), Art Nouveau (1880-1910), Wiener Werkstatte (1903-1933)
in Vienna, De Stijl (1917-1928) in the Netherlands, Bauhaus
(1919-1933) in Germany and Art Deco in Europe and America
(1920-1940).
</P>
<P>
   Modernism, for Ryan, applies to architects, designers and
craftsmen who managed to escape historicism, the tyranny of
previous historical styles and a calcified culture. As he writes in
the introduction to the book that accompanies the exhibition,
``Modernism'' by Alastair Duncan (Antique Collectors Club),
``Centuries of servitude to revivalist design in form and
decoration were forever liberated.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan felt strongly about the collection because ``so many of the
designs that have been produced are by virtual unknowns,'' he said.
``These are designs that have never seen the light of day before
but deserve to be preserved.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, for example, a tall, narrow sterling silver pitcher
from 1901 attributed to a Scot, Archibald Knox, and made by Liberty
&AMP; Company. It looks as streamlined as a torpedo. A hot-pink ceramic
ewer and basin, circa 1905, is attributed to George Logan, also
Scottish, for Wedgwood &AMP; Co. It has a transfer print of a Scottish
rose decoration and a chic black-and-white checkered rim.
</P>
<P>
   These designers, many of them women, shared a forward-looking
vision.``These artist-designers felt the future offered endless
possibilities,'' Ryan said. ``We look around and see endless
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan, the art consultant who wrote the companion book for the
exhibition, said it was important because it was formed by a single
eye and did not focus on precious pieces. These are collectibles
that can still be found: Norman Bel Geddes skyscraper cocktail
shakers, for example, and RCA Victor portable record players.
Duncan's definition of precious is anything that costs $10,000 or
more. As he said, ``When it's over $10,000, people begin to
reconsider.''
</P>
<P>
   One sure crowd-pleaser is the deluxe model Singer vacuum cleaner
from 1938, designed by Malcolm S. Park. It is the machine as a work
of art, with a sinuous aerodynamic aluminum casing and a handle
with a shiny circle that seems meant to advertise Singer in large
capital letters.
</P>
<P>
   Other noteworthy designs in the show include examples from a
line of furniture called Holland Dutch Arts and Crafts, created by
Charles Limbert, an American furniture designer and maker who
marketed his eclectic designs in Grand Rapids, Mich. One oval table
in the show, circa 1910, has flared legs and stained oak stretchers
with cutouts that look as if they were lifted from a piece by
Charles Rennie Mackintosh.
</P>
<P>
   Another stunning piece is a laminated birch armchair designed by
Gerald Summers around 1934 for a London company, Makers of Simple
Furniture Ltd., that went out of business in 1940. Summers was one
of the few British designers in the 1930s whose works rivaled the
design greats on the Continent. He has been compared to Breuer and
Alvar Aalto.
</P>
<P>
   His chair is cut from one sheet of plywood, with certain parts
bent for armrests, others contoured to form the seat and four legs,
and another part fluidly shaped into the backrest.
</P>
<P>
   As Duncan explains in his book, the chair was commissioned for
use in tropical climates; by eliminating joinery and upholstery,
Summers avoided the problems of weakened joints and rotting caused
by extreme humidity. It is both functional and devoid of ornament,
modern in style and materials. ``As an early work of single-piece
construction,'' Duncan writes, ``it would not be equaled again for
several decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn Hiesinger, the curator of decorative arts at the
Philadelphia Museum of Art, spoke at a symposium on modernism at
the Kimbell on Saturday. She pointed out that this spring there had
been exhibitions of Rene Lalique at the Cooper-Hewitt National
Design Museum in Manhattan, of Archibald Knox at the University of
Chicago and of Dagobert Peche at the Museum of Applied Arts in
Vienna. The Victoria and Albert Museum in London is planning a
large Art Nouveau component for its millennium exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   If the Paris exhibition of 1900 brought widespread acceptance to
the emerging Art Nouveau movement, perhaps it is time to study the
earliest roots of modernism as we approach the year 2000.

FROM PREP SCHOOL TO THE PROJECTS: CHECKING IN AT AGE 14 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   `14 UP IN AMERICA' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Showtime, Sunday night at 8 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Written and produced by Vicky Bippart. Phil Joanou, narrator and
director; Marc Reshovsky, cinematographer. A Granada production in
association with the BBC. Michael Apted, Ruth Pitt, executive
producers. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The rich girls get your attention, as rich girls do. Lucy, Kate
and Alexis, once 7-year-old classmates at the Nightingale-Bamford
School in Manhattan, have gone their separate ways: to boarding
school in New Jersey, to a suburban public school and to Chapin.
</P>
<P>
   But here they are together again at age 14, talking to the
director and the cinematographer about subjects like divorce,
money, religion, careers and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   They are among the 16 teen-age subjects of ``14 Up in America,''
a consistently fascinating documentary that has its premiere Sunday
night at 8 on Showtime. Michael Apted, this show's co-executive
producer, started it all when he interviewed an assortment of
British 7-year-olds about their lives and turned the talks into a
1963 film called ``7 Up.''
</P>
<P>
   He returned to the same children every seven years and made a
new film each time (``42 Up'' is coming soon). The American
version, ``Age 7 in America,'' directed by Phil Joanou, won a
Peabody Award in 1991; this is its follow-up.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming message of this ``14 Up'' is how different the
teen-agers are from one another. There's Eric in Chicago,
sophisticated beyond his years, saying things like ``I have a
wonderful staff of designers'' and ``I guess I'm a good CEO.''
</P>
<P>
   He has his own business, creating Web sites for customers around
the world. In another part of Chicago, there's Leroy, who has only
recently moved out of the projects, stating his philosophy about
future romance: ``These girls nowadays can't be trusted.''
</P>
<P>
   There's Joey, who is photographed carrying his hunting rifle
(``You get kind of a rush whenever you kill a deer''), announcing
his complete lack of interest in seeing any part of the world but
his hometown, Dexter, Ga. ``I'm just going to stay around here,''
he says with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   Salina, the daughter of Chinese and Vietnamese immigrants, is
bored because since ``7 Up'' she and her family have moved from Los
Angeles to a small town in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, Kennisha, who seven years ago told the camera, ``You
have to learn how to talk right'' to get ahead, now says,
``Knowledge is the key to life.''
</P>
<P>
   The children in the British ``7 Up'' series turned out to be
surprisingly prescient. Despite disappointments and detours, many
ended up doing exactly what they had predicted. When the subjects
of ``14 Up in America'' grow up, they say, they want to go into
law, medicine, science, computers, rap, basketball or comedy.
</P>
<P>
   And they all say they were happier when they were 7. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `When Trumpets Fade'
</P>
<P>
   HBO, Saturday night at 9 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The closing music for HBO's World War II drama ``When Trumpets
Fade'' is Bing Crosby singing ``White Christmas.'' But that's the
only note of forceful irony in this story of a largely forgotten
battle in Germany, that of the Hurtgen Forest, which makes the
point that even a ``good war'' is filled with senseless bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Eldard is fine as Manning, a burned-out private who keeps
getting promoted and ordered to lead other inexperienced soldiers
into harm's way, and Zak Orth stands out as one of Manning's
particularly frightened men.
</P>
<P>
   But the script, by W.W. Vought, a former industrial-video writer
and director, could have used a little originality. Fans of the
genre may be satisfied, but lines like ``Hey, Sanderson, out there
in the woods with the Krauts, what was it like?'' and ``This is
suicide!'' (shouted into the battlefield radiophone) are so
familiar they border on parody. &QL;

   The New York Times News Service calls your attention to the
following articles on jobs and the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   WORKPLACE-REVIEW-NYT _ These days, it seems people are trying to
be all they can and must be at the office, as the workplace has
become an increasingly popular but elusive spot to look for meaning
and fulfillment in life. It's fine to take the road less traveled,
as long as it means finding a less-congested route to get to the
office earlier. By Adam Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   JOB-HUNTING-HNS (San Francisco) _ Every job hunting guru will
tell you that understanding a company and an industry is crucial,
especially when you're applying for a job. Vault Reports of New
York publishes employer profiles _ some longer than 50 pages _ plus
industry guides based on more than 25,000 surveys and interviews
with workers. By Dave Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   ONJOBS-COLUMN-BOS _ The workplace of the 1990s might seem
threatening to Boomers. Generation Xers, by contrast, have
experienced little else but change. By Diane Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   GRADS-CONSULT-BOS (Undated) _ When Eric Moffett graduated from
Princeton University last year with a degree in economics, the
Houston native knew he wanted to be a businessman. Rather than
choose an industry, however, Moffett took what is becoming a more
familiar road for recent college graduates: He became a consultant.
By Chana Schoenberger.
</P>
<P>
   ATWORK-COLUMN-KAN (Kansas City) _ A disclaimer: Generalizations
and stereotypes follow. You've been warned. I spent a day last week
at a management training seminar in which a communication expert
talked about all the reasons why men are from Mars and women are
from Venus. Or is it the other way around? No, it wasn't the guy
who wrote that book _ which, by the way, I heaved across my bedroom
floor in frustration at the apparently intractable gender
differences. The speaker was another ``he said vs. she said''
author//researcher, who said the brains of men and women appear to
be hard-wired differently to begin with. Then we spend our
formative years playing different kinds of games that push us
further apart. Then we go to work. By Diane Stafford.
</P>
<P>
   WORKING-COLUMN-HNS (Undated) _ Running your own business can be
rough, but it's doubly hard when your clients are a group of
unhappy people. Documented Reference Check is in the business of
checking references. By L.M. Sixel.
</P>
<P>
   WORKPLACE-COLUMN-SMITH-SPI (Undated) _ Bosses have long
suspected their workers are getting less loyal. Now there is
evidence. According to a study released this week, American workers
are less committed to their employers and more likely to switch
jobs for small increases in pay, a trend that is making it
increasingly difficult for companies to hang on to their best
employees in a tight labor market. By Carol Smith.

INSIDE ART: BY PICASSO, FROM HIS MUSE; MAGRITTE, SEPARATELY; AT
ARTISTS SPACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dora Maar, the photographer and painter who was Picasso's lover,
died last summer, with no survivors and no will. But Maar, who was
the principal model for many of Picasso's so-called weeping women
portraits, left an important collection of paintings, drawings and
artifacts, predominantly by Picasso, that is conservatively
estimated to be worth $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   So the French government, as it does in cases like this, brought
in a state-certified genealogist to try to determine whether any
relatives, no matter how distant, were still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Two were discovered, although their names have not been released
to the public. These mystery beneficiaries are to receive the
proceeds of a sale of the collection, to be held on Oct. 27, 28 and
29 at Maison de la Chime in Paris. Two French auction houses _
Mathias and Piasa _ will be holding the sale together.
</P>
<P>
   Piasa is now affiliated with Phillips, the London-based auction
house that also has premises in New York, so a selection of works
in the sale will be on view there from Sept. 25 to 28.
</P>
<P>
   Among the highlights are seven portraits Picasso painted of
Maar. Some of the most important include ``Crying Woman'' (1937),
one of many studies for ``Guernica,'' which is expected to sell at
$2.5 million to $3.3 million; ``Dora Maar Straight On With Green
Nails'' (1936), expected to bring $3.3 million to $5 million, and
``Seated Profile of Dora Maar'' (1936), which carries an estimate
of $1.3 million to $1.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   There are also dozens of drawings and small objects, like a
matchbox on which Picasso drew and stones that he carved when the
couple went to the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Lucien Solanet, a partner of Piasa, said the sale was unusual
because it included ``all kinds of personal items like books that
Picasso had made notes and drawings in, jewelry and even a
champagne cork he had decorated.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Blondeau, the former director of Sotheby's in Paris who is
acting as a consultant for the sale, said that while he was
examining the property, he could ``really feel the passion between
these two human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She was so totally in love with him that these things were
like her fetishes,'' Blondeau added.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's and Christie's expend a considerable amount of effort
trying to get French property to sell in London or New York; they
are eagerly waiting for the European Union to open the French
auction market to other Europeans and Americans, a change expected
to take place this fall.
</P>
<P>
   But given the French government's involvement in the Maar
estate, it is not surprising that two French auction houses were
chosen to sell the property.
</P>
<P>
   Under French rules, selling in Paris, rather than in London or
New York, gives French museums first crack at works of art.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be like the duke and duchess of Windsor sale, but
with more substance,'' Blondeau said. ``Rather than shopping at
Cartier, she shopped at Picasso.''
</P>
<P>
   Magritte, Separately
</P>
<P>
   The cover of the July-August issue of Christie's Magazine shows
a surreal scene: a naked woman against a cloudy sky with a white
bird on her shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   It is from one of a series of eight paintings called ``The
Enchanted Domain,'' studies Rene Magritte made for a monumental
surrealist mural in the Casino Communal at Knokke-le Zoute in
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   The paintings have been on and off the market for 17 years, but
each time, they were offered together, as one work. Now, for the
first time, each will be available for sale individually at
Christie's in London on July 1.
</P>
<P>
   That the paintings are not being kept together has caused a good
deal of debate among art experts in the United States and
elsewhere. Many believe that the paintings should not be separated.
The seller, an unidentified American businessman, bought the suite
purely as an investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about break-up value,'' said a New York dealer, who
spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``It's questionable
art-historically not to sell them together. It goes against the
artist's wishes.''
</P>
<P>
   The group first came on the market at Christie's in New York on
May 19, 1981, where it failed to sell. At the time, Georgette
Magritte, the artist's widow, stipulated that the works be sold as
a single lot, in accordance with her husband's wishes.
</P>
<P>
   From there they went through various dealers' hands and ended up
at the Fuji Gallery in Japan, with a price tag of $14 million to
$16 million for the group. But again no one wanted them. They were
also exhibited in New York on behalf of Fuji. The suite was finally
sold to the man who is Christie's seller next month.
</P>
<P>
   The paintings, which are takeoffs on some of the artist's
cliched subjects, are expected to sell at $600,000 to $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   At Artists Space
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the eve of the 25th anniversary of Artists Space
in September, the nonprofit institution at 38 Greene St. in SoHo
has big plans.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a series of special exhibitions beginning in the
fall, and the publication of a book, ``5,000 Artists Return to
Artists Space: 25 Years,'' in November. The alternative space is
also opening a new gallery at its present site, to be called
Project Space II. It will feature the work of New York-based
artists in shows that will change every month.
</P>
<P>
   That's not all. Artists Space also plans to revive its
long-standing practice of making small grants to artists who live
in New York City and whose proposed project will take place there,
too. The grants, discontinued in 1991 for want of money, will
consist of 20 $500 awards to artists and groups of artists who
propose projects in nontraditional, noncommercial public venues.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are modest grants to encourage artists to do projects
outside of the structure,'' said Claudia Gould, director of Artists
Space.
</P>
<P>
   Grant applications, which will be awarded on a lottery basis
three times a year, will be available at Artists Space beginning on
Sept. 8.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hottest day so far the year will occur in parts of the
Northeast and Middle Atlantic States as increasing breezes from the
southwest import part of the torrid air mass that is been over the
South and Middle West.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of increasing heat and oppressive humidity near
the ground and some cooling aloft will set the stage for clusters
of strong thunderstorms over much of the region. A front moving
slowly south through New England will be the focus for heavy
showers and thunderstorms during much of the day. Farther south,
potent thunderstorms, some with high winds and hail, will erupt
during the heat of the afternoon and evening.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Southeast will remain hot and humid with ample
sunshine. A few isolated afternoon thunderstorms may for near the
southern Appalachians and southern Florida. Meanwhile, bands of
clouds and heavy showers swirling around a tropical disturbance
will swipe coastal Texas and Louisiana. Onshore winds will increase
near the western Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Searing heat will persist from western Texas to the central
Plains. Strengthening low pressure over the Dakotas promote some
strong afternoon thunderstorms near the northern Missouri Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Unseasonably cool air will rush across the Northwest and
northern Rockies, where clouds and showers will be abundant,
especially over the higher terrain. The highest elevations of the
Bitterroots and northern Cascades will have some wet snow.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: HEAT WAVE
</P>
<P>
   A record maximum of 99 degrees was recorded in Little Rock,
Ark., on Wednesday and some residents wondered if this would
constitute a heat wave. There is no official definition of a heat
wave, but in the Northeast, when the mercury rises above 90 degrees
for three consecutive days in Boston or New York, it would be
considered a heat wave. But in Little Rock or Dallas, where the
normal summer maximums rise above 90, an even higher threshold is
required for a heat wave. Melbourne, Fla., which has now set 14
consecutive record highs, is clearly in the midst of a great heat
wave. &QL;

`DEAR JESSE': APPROPRIATING HELMS AS A FOIL AND FELLOW TRAVELER 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the time the documentary ``Dear Jesse'' comes to an end, one
question above all seems to press for an answer: Is this film,
written and directed by Tim Kirkman, likely to change any voter's
mind about Jesse Helms, the conservative Republican who has
represented North Carolina in the Senate since 1972?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Jesse'' is a combination of road movie, personal
exploration, lament for lost love and political statement. What it
is not is a serious journalistic inquiry that might actually
provide a reasoned, fact-based argument for replacing a lawmaker
who has been elected time and again, though never by more than a
slim majority.
</P>
<P>
   So those who already abhor Helms for his outspoken opposition to
homosexuality, abortion, affirmative action and government
financing for the arts and AIDS research are likely to find the
senator to be the Devil they already knew. And those who, as the
film shows in its interviews, find him acceptable because he is
predictable and, as one man says, trustworthy, will encounter
nothing to shake their support.
</P>
<P>
   When it is suggested that big business, including the tobacco
industry, lies behind Helms' success, ``Dear Jesse'' makes no
effort to pursue the assertion. Intrepid journalism is not its
strong point.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the interviews in the documentary are with people like
Mike Nelson, the gay mayor of Carrboro, N.C.; a lesbian couple and
the single mother of a biracial HIV-positive child. All would have
good reason to oppose the senator. In the end, ``Dear Jesse''
amounts to little more than a succession of man- and
woman-in-the-street interviews.
</P>
<P>
   At his most witty, Kirkman, addressing himself to Helms, says:
``For a long time, I thought we had nothing in common, but I
realize now I was wrong. You and I were both born in Monroe, North
Carolina, and raised as Southern Baptists. We both attended Wingate
College for one year each before transferring to other schools.
We've also both worked in journalism and radio broadcasting. But I
believe we have a more significant similarity _ for most of your 24
years in the U.S. Senate, you've been obsessed with homosexual men;
for most of my adult life, so have I.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, after a breakup with his lover in New York City and as
Helms was announcing plans to run again, Kirkman returned to North
Carolina to film ``Dear Jesse'' and to come to terms with his gay
identity and his loss while visiting home and attending a college
reunion. The personal elements of the film make an uneasy fit with
its political message.
</P>
<P>
   Helms was re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTION NOTES:
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Written and directed by Tim Kirkman; produced by Mary Beth Mann;
released by Cowboy Booking International. At Cinema Village, 22

OEDIPUS, SHMEDIPUS: GIVE 'EM A HAPPY ENDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The heyday of Yiddish theater on Second Avenue may
long be over, but the time machine that is the new musical ``The
Fishkin Touch'' is up, running and ready to transport theatergoers
back to that storied past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fishkin Touch'' may not be ``My Fair Lady,'' but this
workmanlike show provides plenty of entertainment by means of a
solid cast, bright lyrics, a plot filled with heartache, heartburn
and romance, and some genuinely funny moments.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't much in the way of dancing, the music may not set
the toes to tapping, and the plot resolutions are so foreseeable
that they can seem a long time coming; but ``The Fishkin Touch,''
which closes the 1997-98 season of the Jewish Repertory Theater,
will send a lot of people home happy.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a story by Greg Armbruster, who wrote the music, and
Lenore Skenazy, who wrote the estimable lyrics, ``The Fishkin
Touch,'' with a book by David Javerbaum, revolves around the the
Fishkin Playhouse in 1910.
</P>
<P>
   With its guarantee of ``a happy ending or your money back,'' the
Fishkin troupe stars the conceited Boris Fishkin (Mike Burstyn), a
combination of ladies' man and mama's boy who is growing a bit too
long in the tooth for some of his roles.
</P>
<P>
   This may not matter in his version of ``Oedipus Rex,'' where his
wife happily turns out not to be his mother; but in ``The Scarlet
Aleph'' or when, as Romeo McCoy, he sings of love to the ``Jew, Jew
Juliet,'' his age is becoming a problem.
</P>
<P>
   His troupe, which includes the warmhearted Sophie (Carolann
Page), one of Boris's old flames, and his domineering and conniving
mother, Zelda (Joan Copeland), could use some fresh blood. Ah, but
the bachelor Boris, it seems, has no heirs; and his theatrical
magic, which he refers to as the Fishkin touch, seems destined to
die with him.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Boris cannot pass it along to the company's newest
member, young Reuben (Jordan Leeds), the actor and aspiring
playwright fresh from the Old World bearing secrets, because he and
Reuben are fundamentally at odds.
</P>
<P>
   The serious Reuben objects to Boris's tampering with classics to
produce happy endings, and soon they part ways, with Reuben forming
a rival company, where his ``Cinderella'' has him jamming his
heroine's foot into workman's boots and singing that ``glass
slippers cannot take the masses where we want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Reuben is soon waiting on tables at the
restaurant where Boris breakfasts and falling in love with the
manager, Rachel (Beth Thompson), whom he rightly suspects would
love to be an actress.
</P>
<P>
   At last, the stage is set for the machinations that compel Boris
to produce Reuben's play, despite its unhappy ending, and for the
assortment of revelations that produce the altogether happy
conclusion of ``The Fishkin Touch.''
</P>
<P>
   Burstyn, whose Broadway credits include ``Barnum,'' revels in
the hammier aspects of Boris's character. Ms. Copeland, whose
award-winning roles include Vera in ``Pal Joey'' and Rose Baum in
``The American Clock,'' hits heights of humor when at last she is
alone with the consequences of her deviousness.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Page makes Sophie a pillar of comfort and love. Ms. Thompson
furnishes the perky romantic charm and dauntless optimism her role
requires. And with his singing and acting, Leeds, seen on Broadway
in ``Les Miserables'' and in previous Jewish Repertory Company
productions, provides ``The Fishkin Touch'' with its essential
chemistry and glue. &QL;

PHOTOGRAPHY REVIEW: THE DAMS OF AMERICA, WITH A JAPANESE TOUCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARGARETT LOKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Toshio Shibata's sublime, crisply detailed portraits
of public-works projects show that human intervention on a pristine
landscape need not be jarring but can, in fact, be in exquisite
harmony with nature.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago
commissioned Shibata, who had spent about 15 years photographing
public-works projects in his native Japan, to create his signature
black-and-white images of the American landscape. Thirteen
photographs from this body of work are on view at the Laurence
Miller Gallery in Soho.
</P>
<P>
   It is said that landscapes reveal the cultures in which they
were made, but the American landscape in Shibata's photographs,
specifically the places where man has left his imprint, has an
unmistakable Japanese esthetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gibson Dam, Lewis and Clark County, Mont.'' (1996) brings to
mind Shibata's 1990 picture of a dam at Kashima in Fukushima
Prefecture, in which a lone branch poised at the gently curving
edge of the man-made waterfall lends a poignant note to a finely
calibrated scene of mirror-smooth water, even, silvery lines of a
waterfall and a foamy mass at the waterfall's base.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson Dam's waterfall also has a gently curving edge, but some
engineer with a lovely (Japanese) sense of esthetics positioned the
waterfall's edge near a cluster of large rocks, and the water
rushes down those rocks, creating a wild counterpoint to the
waterfall's sleek straight lines.
</P>
<P>
   Water has long been a focal point in Shibata's landscape
photography, and he obviously sees it as a source of amazing visual
textures as well as a mirror to catch surrealistic abstractions. In
two astonishingly otherworldly pictures of the Grand Coulee Dam in
Washington, the largest concrete structure in the United States,
it's impossible for the viewer to know what the subject is (the
water's flow and the foam collected below) without being told.
</P>
<P>
   In each image, the frame is divided into two sharply contrasted
segments, the top third virtually black except for a horizontal
white, swirly shape. Taking up the rest of the frame is a flat
plane that ends abruptly where the black part begins. On each plane
are mysterious, fast-moving vertical cloudlike bands. In one
picture, two such bands in a sea of smooth dark gray take center
stage. In the other, the cloudlike bands are off to the sides,
while most of the flat plane, which is streaked with fine vertical
lines, appear to reflect a pileup of clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most landscape photographers, Shibata passes up wide
vistas, zeroing in instead on man's stunning reordering of the
natural world. The horizon may be missing, but the sense of immense
scale and majesty is intact.
</P>
<P>
   Shibata, who is 48, has an impeccable eye for graphic design,
honed, no doubt, while a student at the Tokyo National University
of Fine Arts and Music and, in the mid-1970s, at the Royal Academy
of Ghent in Belgium. His photography shows the influence of
modernists like Harry Callahan and Aaron Siskind, but Shibata cites
Edward Weston as having the most influence on his work. He
discovered Weston's photographs in the late 1970s and was
immediately drawn to their simplicity, beauty and, as he put it,
``abstractness in reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Shibata's photographs of the American landscape are a
superb synthesis of East and West, they were possible only after he
had spent years photographing in his own country. Shibata tried to
photograph the American West in 1985 but, overwhelmed by the sheer
size of the land, he said, the effort was a failure.
</P>
<P>
   For his American landscape commission, Shibata took four
monthlong trips to the United States over the last two years,
photographing in the South (North Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee and
Arkansas) and in the West (Washington, Oregon, Montana, Idaho,
Nevada and Arizona). If the results are any indication, this time
he was very much at home.
</P>
<P>
   Characteristically, in ``Kingman, Mohave County, Ariz.'' (1997),
Shibata focuses on two enigmatic cavelike structures (actually
culverts), whose polished metal sides are contrasted with the
nearby rough ground and the compacted earth above them.
</P>
<P>
   At Nimrod Dam in Perry County, also in Arizona, Shibata catches
a big splash of water at the foot of a concrete platform. The
cone-shaped spray connotes both force and, unexpectedly, fragility
because the spurting water has created lines that resemble the
veins on a Calla lily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bartlett Dam, Maricopa County, Ariz.'' (1997) is simply a
dazzling study in textures. Seemingly carved into a hillside is a
stepped structure not unlike some minimalist sculpture, its smooth
sides mirrored on the body of water at its base, the water's ebony
coloring and smooth surface accentuated by the whiteness of the
surrounding rough-hewn rocks.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition's piece de resistance is ``Weir Dam, Sullivan
County, Tenn.'' (1997). In this riveting work with a touch of the
impossible about it, there is much more than initially meets the
eye.
</P>
<P>
   At first, one might think the rows of gray-white slabs in the
middle of the picture are tombstones. They're not. The slabs and
connecting dark walls are part of the dam, but beyond them is a
serene panorama: many young trees with slender trunks, a few dark
low clumps of trees, a low wooden bridge and, seated on lawn chairs
to the extreme right of the picture, two men dressed as if they're
going fishing. The trees in the distance bring the viewer back to
the foreground of the picture, with tall trees and the sky
reflected upside-down on the water. But look again and at the
bottom of the water is a bed of pebbles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing in nature has a hard outline,'' wrote the 19th-century
British photographer Peter Henry Emerson. Yes, but seen through
Shibata's lens, human impositions of hard outlines have a way of
making nature all the more wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   Toshio Shibata's photographs remain at the Laurence Miller
Gallery, 138 Spring St., Soho, through July 10.

 &HT;    Venezuela tar fuel banned in Florida
 &HT;    By Charles Elmore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE _ Florida officials slammed the tanker door shut on
a controversial tar fuel from Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Cabinet officials decisively rejected Orimulsion recently after
years of back-and-forth debate over whether it should be burned in
a U.S. power plant for the first time. Hundreds of sign-carrying,
button-wearing partisans on both sides of the issue overflowed the
Capitol meeting room.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-1 vote stands to cost a Boca Raton company, Bitor America
Corp., $160 million a year. It is ready to fill a contract with
Florida Power &AMP; Light Co. to supply the fuel to a Manatee County
power plant from Bitor's parent Venezuelan exporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 3.5 million customers of FPL are the real losers,'' said
Juan Pulgar, president of Bitor America, referring to claims
customers would save up to five percent on their power bills over
the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   It was a big victory for environmental groups who said the
potential savings were not worth poorly-understood risks of water
and air pollution. CSX Corp., a coal shipper with an economic
interest in stopping Orimulsion, helped coordinate opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cabinet system works,'' said a jubilant Tom Reese,
attorney for ManaSota88, a group opposing FPL's plan. Unlike most
other states, Florida has an elected Cabinet that rules on issues
such as power-plant proposals.
</P>
<P>
   FPL, owned by FPL Group Inc. of Juno Beach, said it would
actually reduce sulphur and other emissions by burning the gooey
mixture of bitumen and water in its Manatee County plant and
perhaps later in other plants including Indiantown in Martin
County. FPL said it will consider an appeal to the First District
Court of Appeal in Tallahassee on the grounds the Cabinet did not
properly show why it is turning down the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we're very disappointed,'' said FPL President Paul
Evanson. ``We'll have to look at the order and make a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote was the clearest rebuff yet by the Cabinet in three
cracks on Orimulsion, interspersed with rulings by an
administrative law judge who twice approved FPL's plan.
</P>
<P>
   It is backed by a 50-page order detailing what FPL has failed to
show about nitrogen oxide emissions and other possible
environmental dangers.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Commissioner Bob Crawford cast the lone vote for
Orimulsion without comment.
</P>
<P>
   One Cabinet member who supported Orimulsion in two previous
votes said public opinion was running so strongly against it that
she was changing her vote even though she found FPL's plan
reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the facts seem to support this application, the people
don't,'' Secretary of State Sandra Mortham said.
</P>
<P>
   Calls and mail to her office ran against Orimulsion 100-1, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people have spoken to me on this issue, and my job is to
listen,'' Mortham said, a former state representative from the
Tampa Bay area.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Katherine Harris, who is trying to tar Mortham with
the Orimulsion issue in the Republican primary for Secretary of
State, claimed credit for her opponent's change of heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased that phone calls generated by my television ad
played a role in Sandy Mortham's decision to changer her position
on this critical issue,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Education Commissioner Frank Brogan said what bothered him was
that Venezuela does not burn the fuel within its own borders.
</P>
<P>
   Pulgar said that is because Venezuela's needs are 70 percent met
by hydroelectric power and most of the rest by natural gas that is
a byproduct of the nation's oil drilling and refining.

OPERA REVIEW: CHARACTER STUDIES FROM THREE COMPOSERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Encompass Music Theater, a company that
specializes in contemporary American chamber opera, and the Amas
Musical Theater, a group devoted to multicultural programming, have
joined forces for an inventive and mostly pleasing triple bill at
the Salon Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The three works _ Dominick Argento's ``Miss Havisham's Wedding
Night'' (1981), Victor Kioulaphides' ``Ocean Dream'' (1992) and
Arif Mardin's ``I Will Wait'' _ share a fascination with the
psychological dynamic of a single central character.
</P>
<P>
   In the Argento work, which is based on a character in Dickens'
``Great Expectations,'' that dynamic is madness and subtle
malevolence. Miss Havisham, abandoned on her wedding day, smashed
all her clocks and has been roaming her house dressed in her
wedding gown for decades. Argento treated this material more
extensively in ``Miss Havisham's Fire,'' a full-length work that
was performed at the New York City Opera a few years before he
composed this extended mad scene.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Wedding Night,'' which has a libretto by John
Olon-Scrymgeour, Miss Havisham relives her wedding day, confronts
an apparition meant to be Matt, her departed beau, and in the end
settles down for an afternoon with young Estella, telling her,
``Now let us drink our tea, and I will tell you all about men.''
</P>
<P>
   Argento is more sensitive to the natural limitations of the
voice than many contemporary composers; but he is also unafraid to
stretch a singer's limits, and in this work he has kept the great
Donizetti and Bellini mad scenes in mind. This proves a wonderful
star turn for Elizabeth Keusch. At the Wednesday evening
performance, she had both the vocal power and color and the
dramatic flexibility to make Miss Havisham alternately pitiful and
terrifying.
</P>
<P>
   Kioulaphides and Mardin look at healthier developments. In
``Ocean Dream,'' which has a libretto by Nancy Rhodes (who also
directed the three works and is artistic director of the Encompass
company), a young woman at the beach discovers her inner child and
becomes a more integrated personality. We have to take her word for
this: the work offers no sense of her back story.
</P>
<P>
   Kioulaphides' music is accessible and lush, and draws
occasionally on Baroque and Renaissance elements. Malaika Sims was
energetic and agile as the child, and Leah Fitschen sang the
woman's music with the right proportions of anxiety and sweetness.
</P>
<P>
   Mardin, who is best known as a producer of jazz and pop
recordings for Atlantic Records, wrote his own libretto for ``I
Will Wait,'' a look at the transition from life to afterlife. The
central character, an unnamed young man, has died but resists
moving on despite the entreaties of his already dead wife, who
sings that they can now be together forever.
</P>
<P>
   Mardin is at his best in music that draws on exotic sources; the
atonal and angular sections don't work as well, and even given the
subject, the vocal music is often too overwrought. Juliana
Janes-Yaffe gave the sometimes overwrought Young Woman's music a
fair spin; a few vocal dry patches marred Kyle Pfortmiller's
account of the Young Man.
</P>
<P>
   John Kochansky, the set designer, put abstract paintings and
whimsical elements at the service of the works at hand. A chamber
orchestra, conducted by John Yaffe provided polished accompaniments
for the Argento and Kioulaphides works, but was less consistent in
the Mardin score.
</P>
<P>
   The performances continue through Sunday at the Salon Theater,
432 E. 91st St., Manhattan.

 &HT;    BREWER'S DEFENSE IMPRESSES HEAT WITH 51ST PICK
 &HT;    By TOM D'ANGELO
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ For most second-round picks, the odds of making the NBA
are overwhelming. And although Corey Brewer will have a difficult
time sticking with the Miami Heat, he does have one advantage: He
could be the second-best point guard on the team during training
camp.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat selected Brewer, a 6-foot-2 point guard from Oklahoma,
with the 51st pick in Wednesday's draft. Brewer was rated as high
as No.3 on some point guard lists, below No.2 pick Mike Bibby and
Florida's Jason Williams, the seventh overall pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think we need more support at that position and any time
you get a player who has the skills this guy has and defensive
ability, I think you got to pick him,'' Heat coach Pat Riley said.
``He will defend the ball better than anybody in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Hardaway is the only true point guard on the Heat's roster.
Backup Eric Murdock is a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer is noted for his defense and toughness, but struggled
with turnovers and was sometimes used as a shooting guard. He
averaged 20.8 points last season but shot just .428 in his two
seasons at Oklahoma. He was an honorable mention All-America and
first-team All-Big 12 as a senior.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kid is one of the hardest playing, hard-nosed,
tough-minded competitors,'' Riley said. ``He's a real, real
winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley said Miami had three players it was interested in when it
came the Heat's time to pick.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat had to wait more than three hours after the draft
started to participate after trading their first-round pick in
February to the Clippers in the Isaac Austin-for-Brent Barry deal.
</P>
<P>
   If Miami had retained the pick, it would have had a choice
between 6-10 Brian Skinner (22nd to the Clippers), point guard
Tyronn Lue (23rd to Denver), guard Felipe Lopez (24th to San
Antonio), guard Corey Benjamin (28th to Chicago) and center Nazr
Mohammed (29th to Utah), among others.
</P>
<P>
   Riley said the Heat inquired about moving up in the second round
but, ``it's ridiculous what teams want for second-round picks,'' he
said. The Heat did not make a serious effort to get into the first
round.
</P>
<P>
   Among the higher-rated players available when the Heat finally
selected were point guard Anthony Carter of Hawaii; forwards Corey
Lewis of Florida State and J.R. Henderson of UCLA; and center Brad
Miller of Purdue.

 &HT;    NBA DRAFT A TRUE CLINIC IN INEXACT SCIENCE
 &HT;    By GREG STODA
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the NBA college draft (and, hey, it's really a high
school/college/around-the-world draft) is so important, how come
the so-called lottery teams _ the ones with the most advantageous
positions for making selections _ look so familiar year after year
after year?
</P>
<P>
   Because, by deductive reasoning, the draft isn't all that
important. The typical exercise results in some kid going to a bad
team, making little or no difference and falling into the
monotonous rut of losing season after losing season.
</P>
<P>
   There is, after all, only so much a Michael Olowokandi can do
for the Los Angeles Clippers. Or a Mike Bibby for the Vancouver
Grizzlies. Or a Raef LaFrentz for the Denver Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
   Think there's a sudden rush for playoff tickets in any of those
cities?
</P>
<P>
   None of it makes any sense, really.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, of course, you think it made sense that Antawn Jamison
and Vince Carter, recent teammates at North Carolina, were traded
for each other after being picked back-to-back by the Toronto
Raptors and Golden State Warriors, respectively, during Wednesday
night's annual shopfest.
</P>
<P>
   And, no, there's not much Jamison or Carter can do for Toronto
or Golden State, either, regardless of which player is in which
place.
</P>
<P>
   Go right on down the list of the evening's player-to-franchise
weddings, and you'll find not one union that is a sure thing to
improve a downtrodden team to any significant extent.
</P>
<P>
   (Oh, sure, Tim Duncan popped up in the first spot last year and
made a better team of San Antonio, but that was something of an
aberration. The Spurs had averaged 54-plus wins per season for the
previous eight years before injuries dropped them to a 20-62 record
just before Duncan's arrival.)
</P>
<P>
   The truth of the matter is that for all the scouting reports and
all the workouts private and public, the draft is hardly an exact
science.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for perfect example, the case of Olowokandi, a 7-footer
who grew up in England the son of a Nigerian diplomat and has been
playing basketball for only three years. He attended the University
of the Pacific only because he called an assistant coach at the
school, and told him he was interested in playing there.
</P>
<P>
   You have to wonder how that conversation went, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello. My name is Michael Olowokandi. I'm calling from
England. I'm very tall. I would like to come play basketball at
your school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, right. But just for fun, Mr. Candy, how tall are you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``My name is Olowokandi. O-L-O-W-O-K-A-N-D-I. I am 7 feet tall.
I have set jumping records in track in England, and I am a good
soccer player, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Spell that again, give me your number, and don't lose this
one. Don't call anyone else, either. We'll get right back to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why someone like Heat boss Pat Riley wants no part of
the high-priced, high-risk guesswork involved with the draft.
Besides, Riley regards NBA rookies with the same disdain he
reserves for soft defense.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, since arriving in South Florida prior to the 1995-96
season, it should come as no surprise that Riley has been almost
completely uninvolved in first-round speculation.
</P>
<P>
   He did trade for Utah's first-round selection (Martin Muursepp)
in 1996, but soon thereafter packaged him with Kurt Thomas (the
Heat's first-round pick in 1995) and Sasha Danilovic in exchange
for Dallas' Jamal Mashburn. He drafted Charles Smith out of New
Mexico in last year's first round, but quickly traded him and Ike
Austin plus this year's first-round selection for Brent Barry of
the Los Angeles Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   So, for all practical purposes, the Heat's first-rounders during
Riley's regime have been Mashburn and Barry.
</P>
<P>
   As inexact science goes, that's not bad.

 &HT;    WEDDING PLANNERS SAY `I DO' TO NEW INSURANCE
 &HT;    By LYNDA EDWARDS
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tell a couple that a certain day positively, absolutely must be
the happiest day of their life _ and an audience of friends and
relatives will be watching for happiness verification _ and you've
got the makings of a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   But that's what happens every June wedding season. And this can
mean trouble for brides, grooms and the people tapped to make
matrimony happen.
</P>
<P>
   This wedding season, though, there is protection of sorts; last
fall, the Florida Department of Insurance approved the sale of
wedding insurance.
</P>
<P>
   When a high-end wedding goes wrong in Palm Beach County, the
wedding consultant is vulnerable to a lawsuit from an irate bride
or groom, says Gayle Lebenow, a West Palm Beach-based events
planner and Florida Coordinator of the National Association of
Bridal Consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Weddings can be competitive, Lebenow says, with parents
comparing the flowers, the dresses, the food and the decorations.
``If there's a glitch'', she says, ``their enemies notice as well
as friends, so what the bride usually sues for is emotional
distress and mental suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   The policies are underwritten by Fireman's Fund Insurance, which
has covered about 5,000 weddings since it created the concept in
1992. Other companies offer, for a one-shot fee, ``weather
insurance,'' which covers cancellation of an event due to rain or
snow.
</P>
<P>
   Wedding insurance, however, covers everything from a stained
wedding dress to bitter cake icing.
</P>
<P>
   And bridal consultants have seen it all.
</P>
<P>
   One bride sued her wedding planner because pink flowers were
used in a flower girl's basket, said Gerard Monaghan, president of
the National Association of Bridal Consultants. The bride wanted
white. The florist corrected the error before the ceremony but the
bride claimed she was traumatized by her attendants' tittering.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, concerns are mostly weather related.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 300 to 400 requests out of Florida last hurricane
season,'' said California-based Robert Nuccio, the sole
administrator assigned to Fireman's wedding insurance program. He
won't say how much money wedding insurance brings Fireman's, ``but
this is not a moneymaker.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We do it for the publicity, to be honest,'' he said. ``Too
many things can go wrong in a wedding due to the emotionally
charged nature of the day. We have to pay out fairly often.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest amount Fireman's Fund had to pay in Florida was a
``half-million dollars for host liquor liability,'' Nuccio says.
``Someone got drunk and into an accident on the way home from the
wedding.'' The guest not only sued the newlyweds and their planner
but the deejay and photographer as well. The plaintiff blamed them
for contributing to the merriment that prompted him to knock back
cocktails.
</P>
<P>
   A fee of $3,500 gets the payer $200,000 worth of wedding
insurance coverage. The simplest, cheapest deal is a $200 policy
that reimburses the buyer $3,000 in case of a wedding cancellation
due to weather, dresses not arriving on time, the photographer
failing to show up or ``any reason other than change of heart on
the part of the bride or groom,'' said Nuccio. (Even Lloyds of
London, which insures everything from starlets' legs to zoos,
wouldn't touch that. Too much chance of collusion between phony
lovebirds.)
</P>
<P>
   Photographers, too, should consider wedding insurance, says
Patrick Lyons, vice president of the Wedding Professionals of
Central Florida. Lyons says a bride refused to pay him because a
woman she no longer liked was in one picture.
</P>
<P>
   One uninsured wedding consultant had to restage three weddings
at her own expense when the photographer she had contracted snapped
abysmal pictures. It cost her more than $8,000 to re-bake the three
cakes, duplicate the decors and transport guests back to pose and
mimic mistiness, surprise and delight before a new lensman.
</P>
<P>
   Nuccio's individual client list is confidential. He can state
that institutions, such as the Lowe Art Museum at the University of
Miami, buy the policies at the urging of their risk managers when
weddings are held there. If a drunken guest tumbles into a
sculpture, the museum can recoup.
</P>
<P>
   But the most frequent reason a claim is filed for lavish
weddings? ``It's because dad loses his job and can't pay for the
scheduled wedding, even in this boom-boom economy,'' Nuccio says.
``We paid a ton of money out when Xerox downsized.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the truest test of love is that it survives a bad wedding.
One way to ease jitters is to remember that if this really were the
happiest day of a couple's life, the marriage would then be an
anticlimax.
</P>
<P>
   ``The couples who have the best times are the ones who believe
that the best is yet to come,'' Lebenow says. ``And that mind-set
is a result of personality, not money.''

CRISP, SO STYLISHLY 89, GETS TO THE POINT, WELL, CRISPLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ People may think Quentin Crisp is joking when he
says, ``I never read books; I wait for it all to be on
television.'' On Wednesday night, during the question-and-answer
period of ``An Evening With Quentin Crisp,'' someone tested him by
asking just what shows he watched. `` `Homicide,' `The Practice,'
`Brooklyn South,''' he said. ``I like the programs that threaten
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he has been asked that question a thousand times and
answered the same way. Maybe, in fact, Crisp's new two-hour
production does not contain a single sentence that he has not
already used elsewhere. But if so, no one seemed to care. As those
NBC advertisements say, pushing the network's reruns this summer,
it's new to you.
</P>
<P>
   ``An Evening With Quentin Crisp,'' which continues Wednesdays
through Sundays through July 5, is a delight. It is also a low-key
affair. In the cozy setting of the Grove Street Playhouse, it's a
little like sitting at the feet of a favorite professor. There's a
lot of affection in the air, and the acolytes sometimes have to
strain to hear the words of wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Crisp sits in a gilt-accented chair beside a small table that
holds a vase of plump pink roses. (Well, he does stand up once, to
do an imitation of Eva Peron.) He wears a black velvet suit, a
wide-brimmed gray hat, an ascot-style scarf and a large, glittery
pin. He will be 90 in December, but the only sign of possible
frailty is an occasional cough.
</P>
<P>
   Crisp devotes much of the first act to his recommendations for
achieving style, a subject he knows a good deal about. Some of his
tips: Get rid of everything in your house or apartment that doesn't
represent who you are.
</P>
<P>
   (``You should regard your home as your dressing room.'') Do not
take any evening classes, unless they are in singing or dancing.
Live alone. Try not to get stuck in a job in which you deal only
with ``things,'' even if those things are books or sculptures. Take
up one of the stylish professions: teaching, acting, preaching.
Most important, ``You have to take a long, hard look at what your
friends call `the trouble with you.''' Use it. Then ``polish up
your identity until it becomes a style.''
</P>
<P>
   The show's second act is devoted completely to questions from
the audience, so each night's performance is different, at least
hypothetically. On Wednesday night, he ended up talking about his
admiration for Elizabeth Taylor, his bad reviews in San Francisco,
a recent visit to David Hare's play ``The Judas Kiss'' and why no
one in England goes to the gym.
</P>
<P>
   Then he was asked his opinion of Noel Coward. Avoiding a
thumbs-up or thumbs-down assessment, Crisp said simply that Coward
``wrote lines that actresses liked to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Crisp, who has made a career of being quotable, in books like
``The Naked Civil Servant'' and ``How to Become a Virgin,'' writes
lines that audiences love to repeat. ``Beauty is a complete waste
of time,'' he said. ``Style begets style.'' And ``I am so old that
I can remember when Bette Davis was a nice girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course it's a little hard to work that last one into a
conversation. &QL;

<P>
   The man whom they celebrated at a Beacon Theater concert on
Monday evening as part of the JVC Jazz Festival is John Levy, the
86-year-old former bass player with Stuff Smith who has been
managing artists since 1951. One after another, Levy's clients
rhapsodized about their trust in him and the personal attention he
has devoted to their careers. Levy came briefly to the stage at one
point.
</P>
<P>
   Although the tributes being offered seemed genuinely heartfelt,
the musical aspect of the evening was decidedly uneven. Williams
was by far the most exuberant performer, but his abbreviated set at
the end of the show left the audience hungry for more. This great
swing and blues vocalist, who will turn 80 in December, remains in
full command of a rangy bass-baritone voice that is equally
striking crooning a ballad (a nostalgic ``Trust in Me'' that showed
off the mellow expansiveness of his upper register) or swinging out
in a rich, husky blues bark (``Muddy Water,'' done as a
call-and-response with the audience).
</P>
<P>
   Shearing, accompanied by his longtime bassist, Neil Swainson,
dug way back to unearth a jump tune, ``Strolling,'' composed by
Levy in 1949. The pianist's spare, careful renditions of songs like
his own neatly patterned ``Conception'' and of the Billie
Holiday-associated ``That Old Devil Called Love'' had an almost
dainty precision and reminded one of the garden-party gentility of
so much English jazz in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Horn, at her best, transforms songs into lingering jazz-pop
meditations in which her pianism and quiet husky singing seamlessly
weave together to cast a spell. But at Monday's concert, in which
she performed two ballads (``Close Enough for Love'' and ``Where Do
You Start?'') and one uptempo song (``Fever''), Ms. Horn lost the
thread of the lyrics more than once, and the aura of concentrated
emotional intensity that she can bring to a song flickered only
intermittently.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Wilson, who ended the first half of the evening with the
show's longest set, can't be faulted for lack of concentration. But
her extremely mannered renditions of signature songs like ``Guess
Who I Saw Today'' substituted eccentrically flashy dynamics (half
whispered interpolations and abrupt yodeling whoops at the ends of
phrases) for considered lyrical readings.
</P>
<P>
   One of the brighter segments of the evening was a set by the
partly reconstituted Cannonball Adderley quintet, led by Vincent
Herring on saxophone and Longineu Parsons (substituting for the
ailing Nat Adderley) on trumpet. The set featured two upbeat
favorites, ``Jive Samba'' and ``The Work Song.''
</P>
<P>
   The pianist and jazz educator Billy Taylor and Nicole Yarling, a
singer and jazz violinist who is a recent addition to Levy's client
roster, opened the festivities.

`MEDIUM': MOURNING SCHUBERT WITH OBLIQUE SIMPLICITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Mark Morris Dance Group returned to the Brooklyn
Academy of Music on Wednesday night with Morris' familiar staging
of Purcell's miniopera ``Dido and Aeneas'' and the New York
premiere of ``Medium.''
</P>
<P>
   The new work radiates a tantalizing, even mesmerizing,
simplicity that should not be equated with directness. Levels of
meaning seem to hang in the air in a complicit dialogue between the
choreography and the music by the contemporary composer John
Harbison.
</P>
<P>
   The score's title is ``November 19, 1828,'' referring to the
date of Schubert's death, and Harbison has incorporated snatches of
Schubert's music and even apparently written a fugue out of the
source material that the 19th-century composer had planned to use
himself.
</P>
<P>
   The temptation is to decode the choreography for references
contained in the music, which reportedly plays with the musical
counterpart of the letters of Schubert's name. But to see
``Medium'' as a hidden tale about Schubert is to see it as a
studied exercise rather than a work that invites feeling from the
viewer.
</P>
<P>
   The choreography is all aura, which spreads an eerie texture
that originates in another dialogue. This one is between a pianist,
Ethan Iverson, and a string trio, Sara Roth, Carol Benner and Jason
Duckles, all in the pit.
</P>
<P>
   The small units of dancers onstage are initially identified with
the alternating strings or piano but this musical visualization is
abandoned by Morris as his structures onstage become more complex
and all six dancers do similar movements but at different times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medium,'' nonetheless, is not a purely formal work; Schubert
may not die onstage, but by the time one of the women, Tina
Fehlandt, lies down with another dancer, comforting her at the end,
the piece has moved toward an image of tender mourning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medium'' is an unaffected piece; affecting would, in fact, be
the term for it. Three men, Joe Bowie, David Leventhal and
Guillermo Resto, and three women, Ms. Fehlandt, June Omura and
Mireille Radwan-Dana, lie or stand in the beginning and move in
short segments, often stopping to strike poses that Michael
Chybowski's ever fine lighting renders painterly.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Pakledinaz has designed high-waisted and transparent
gowns for the women while the men are in yeoman gear. Nothing
specific occurs onstage but the strange beauty of the piece lies in
its constantly changing spatial composition. It is the ether around
the humans that seems more potent and enveloping.
</P>
<P>
   There are, nevertheless, encounters. The trio lying on the floor
at the start breaks up to regroup with the standing dancers;
sometimes one dancer slips in between two. The medium of the title
is less the idiom (palms held out in broad gestures in the Morris
free style) through which the dancers communicate than the music,
as the spiritual messenger through which the dancers seek to
commune into the great beyond.
</P>
<P>
   After the music grows emphatic, three of the women recline
serenely. The dancing, like the score's four movements, is full of
constant awakenings. People start up or suddenly sit up until the
light dims on Ms. Fehlandt. The final image, like the entire piece,
has an elegiac purity.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The same could be said this time around for ``Dido and Aeneas,''
which Morris originally directed and choreographed a decade ago. As
a man portraying both an austere Dido, queen of Carthage and her
nemesis, the uninhibited Sorceress, Morris was somewhat on the
self-aware side in his performances in the past.
</P>
<P>
   But now his Dido dies a moving death, slumped over a small piece
of a balustrade, and his focused performance lends a new
seriousness to the endeavor. This is not a ``Dido'' for every
taste, and its use of singers and musicians performing in the pit
while dancers mime the words is an old device.
</P>
<P>
   But all the elements come together in what is essentially an
exercise in stylization that ends by illuminating aspects of the
opera. The vocal side was richly represented by the soloists
(Stephanie Novacek as both Dido and the Sorceress, Christine
Brandes as Belinda, James Maddalena as Aeneas, and Eileen Clark
Reisner and Philip Anderson) and the New York Collegium Orchestra
and Chorus, conducted with verve by Craig Smith.
</P>
<P>
   For all its communal exuberance, the Morris troupe is exemplary
in its discipline, as seen in its precise friezelike groupings.
Resto was the onstage Aeneas hoodwinked by the galumphing witch.
The provocative touches are still there (the witch mimes an
auto-erotic moment). But these are fleeting images to test audience
perception.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we have become used to Morris' hair style: long curls
clipped at the nape for the dignified queen, hanging loose for the
couch-potato witch.

actress Lauren Bacall's interest in professional bowling. Chances

<P>
   NBA-DRAFT _ If the NBA college draft (and, hey, it's really a
high school/college/around-the-world draft) is so important, how
come the so-called lottery teams _ the ones with the most
advantageous positions for making selections _ look so familiar
year after year after year? Because, by deductive reasoning, the
draft isn't all that important. (Stoda, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

A MOTORCYCLE OF ONE'S OWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (see also MOTORCYCLE-ART)  
(ja) 
 By PETER FONDA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bikers ride as nomads, in clubs and in gangs, but no matter how
you ride, if you're a biker you're an individual: Nobody has a
motorcycle quite like yours.
</P>
<P>
   Motorcycles come off the factory line looking very much alike,
but most riders customize their bikes to get the look they want.
This is because to a biker a motorcycle is an imperative extension
of the self, an interpretation of an inner attitude. In this way, a
motorcycle is a work of art to the rider.
</P>
<P>
   Motorcyclists will repaint their bikes and change the
headlights, the taillights, the carrying bags, the footboards and
the seat. They'll decorate with pinstriping, more chrome or less
chrome, more lights or fewer lights. There are endless
possibilities for personalizing a bike. To me, it doesn't matter
how much customizing is done. A few changes here or there may
suffice. But I want to ride my own motorcycle, one that nobody else
has.
</P>
<P>
   I owned my first motorcycle in 1961, when I was 21, but the
first bike I customized was the one I rode in ``Easy Rider,'' which
became an international icon. I had faith that the film would be
successful but was not sure how successful. I took delight that at
the least I had designed myself a very cool and unique chopper.
</P>
<P>
   For the movie, I bought four Los Angeles Police Department
motorcycles at auction, for $500 apiece. Two were for Dennis Hopper
to ride, and two for me. I came up with a redesign for them and did
the work with the help of several friends. I have owned or ridden
some of the great motorcycles in the world, but I have a particular
feeling for my ``Easy Rider'' bike because it was the first I made
my own.
</P>
<P>
   We burned one of the bikes in the film, and, sadly, the other
three were stolen before we finished production.
</P>
<P>
   I own several bikes now, but my favorite is my '98
Harley-Davidson Road King. As soon as I bought the motorcycle, I
began to modify it to my liking. I changed the leather panniers to
black plastic ones and had them repainted red and pinstriped on the
bottom half _ a reverse of the paint scheme on the gas tanks. I
changed the footboards, handlebars and grips, tail lights and other
trims. There's no other bike like mine.
</P>
<P>
   As I do on all my bikes, I also changed the seat, to a solo, as
I never carry a passenger. Riding a motorcycle is something I do
alone. I love to ride. I have no timetables, no reservations. I
travel with a tent and sleeping bag, so I can stop anywhere and be
covered. On the road there are no fences and an extraordinary sense
of freedom. It could have been this way 150 or 100 years ago, in
the Old West, with the sense of endless possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   I have ridden down the west side of the Continental Divide to
the Mexican border and back up the east side, returning to my
ranch, north of Yellowstone Park. It's more than 2,500 miles. I
ride as many summits as I can. I never ride freeways longer than
necessary. Sometimes I bring a seven-piece Hardy fly rod and fish
for trout. Barbless catch-and-release. So free.
</P>
<P>
   I need to ride like this. I never feel alone. I never feel
separated from the Earth. In fact, the experience makes me feel
even more a part of the planet.
</P>

ALEXANDER RODCHENKO: WHEN RADICAL ART AND POLITICS MARCHED
TOGETHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Great Experiment. The term is frequently applied
to the modern art of Russia in the years between 1919 and 1927,
when Russian Constructivism, one of the most radical manifestations
of early 20th-century art, was, for all intents and purposes, the
official style of the newly formed communist government.
</P>
<P>
   It was a time when a handful of contentious avantgarde artists,
under the slogan ``Art Into Life!,'' cast themselves as
full-fledged participants in the Russian Revolution. Subjugating
personal expression to the state's utilitarian needs in the belief
that art could help form a new society, they designed everything
from stationery to household objects to public monuments, made
films and took photographs, some of which are modernist landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   Radical political thought and radical art seemed to be in step
with each other as never before, or since. But like most
experiments, this one was short-lived and was soon ground beneath
the heel of the 20th-century's first totalitarian state.
</P>
<P>
   By 1932 Stalin's brutal regime had imposed Socialist Realism as
the official style, ordered the destruction of modernist works in
state museums, imprisoned and even executed some artists, dismissed
others and forced still others into the humiliating posture of
``reconstruction'' to exorcise tendencies deemed formalist,
imperialist or elitist.
</P>
<P>
   To know this history intellectually is not the same as seeing it
played out in visual form _ as it is in the Museum of Modern Art's
survey of the career of Alexander Rodchenko, Russian
Constructivism's most politically adept protagonist.
</P>
<P>
   This is the largest survey of Rodchenko's work mounted in the
United States, and represents a curatorial collaboration between
Magdalena Dabrowski, senior curator, department of drawings at the
Modern; Peter Galassi, chief curator of the museum's department of
photography, and Leah Dickerman, an assistant professor of art
history at Stanford University. It contains 300 paintings,
sculptures, drawings, linocuts, photographs and examples of graphic
design whose numbers include posters, book covers, candy wrappers,
magazine spreads _ many involving ingenious uses of photomontage.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition's reading room is a meticulous re-creation of the
``Workers' Reading Room'' designed by Rodchenko for the 1925
Exposition of Decorative Arts in Paris, complete with stark gray
chairs that are about as comfortable as Pilgrim stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Most impressive are the graphic designs, especially the nearly
three dozen magazine covers for the magazine of leftist esthetics
``Lef'' and its successor, ``Novyi Lef,'' which exploit the bold
geometry of Cyrillic lettering, and many of the photographs from
the mid-1920s, after Rodchenko made some of art history's first
monochrome paintings and announced the death of the medium.
</P>
<P>
   As a whole, the show is by turn illuminating, tragic and
chilling and generally more historically interesting than visually
thrilling. It portrays a fiercely cerebral, problem-solving artist,
bent on progress, who may have been so successful at expunging the
personal from his art that it sometimes seems hollow or to possess
little more than a period look.
</P>
<P>
   But if Rodchenko's art is short on psychological insight or the
pleasures of the eye _ for that there's the Bonnard exhibition on
the floor below _ he is so versatile and diversely innovative that
simply presenting the first two busy decades of his career sums up
a great deal about Constructivism and its time. In many ways he was
the Great Experiment's greatest utility player.
</P>
<P>
   Rodchenko arrived in Moscow in 1915 at the age of 24, having
already absorbed most of the innovations of Cubism and Futurism and
made some abstract art of his own. These geometric ink drawings,
hanging near the show's entrance, were included in an exhibition in
1916 organized by Vladimir Tatlin, whose designs for the Cafe
Pittoresque, of 1917, are generally viewed as the beginning of
Constructivism.
</P>
<P>
   By 1920, Rodchenko was part of a rare phenomenon: an
institutionally supported avantgarde that included filmmakers Dziga
Vertov and Sergei Eisenstein, and poet Vladimir Mayakovsky, as well
as Malevich, Kandinsky and Varvara Stepanova, Rodchenko's lifelong
companion. With others they established and taught at art schools,
organized state exhibitions and new museums, hammered out esthetic
programs and founded magazines, like ``Lef.''
</P>
<P>
   And they fought over turf. As Rodchenko's materialist,
objectivist approach to art gained ground over Kandinsky's more
subjective approach, Rodchenko was prominent in a group that ousted
Kandinsky from his teaching position, prompting him to leave the
Soviet Union for the friendlier waters of the Bauhaus.
</P>
<P>
   Rodchenko's sensibility should be familiar to anyone with a
passing knowledge of Minimal and Conceptual Art, and it makes sense
that interest in his art began to revive in the early 1970s, when
those styles held sway. (In 1971, the Museum of Modern Art mounted
a small show of works from its collection, the first outside the
Soviet Union.)
</P>
<P>
   In the opening galleries of the exhibition, where Rodchenko
rapidly pursues formalist reduction to its logical conclusion, one
catches intimations of the work of Dan Flavin, Mel Bochner and Sol
LeWitt. His black on black paintings, made in response to
Malevich's white-on-white works, presage the subtleties of Ad
Reinhardt's shadowy canvases. His statements announcing the death
of painting, the importance of physicality, new materials and
``real space,'' the triumph of construction over old-fashioned
composition sound surprisingly like those of Donald Judd.
</P>
<P>
   The almost relentless formal innovations of these early years
can be measured in circles. First there are the fuzzed, glowing
orbs of ``Composition No. 113 on Yellow Ground,'' which borrows
some of Malevich's visionary light. These are followed by linear
ones in ``Construction No. 127,'' drawn with geometry-class
precision in white chalk on black. The circle then leaps into real
space in the concentric ellipses of Rodchenko's hanging ``Spatial
Construction No 12.'' (That all these works were possibly made
within a single year, 1920, only adds to the sense of ferment.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By 1922 Rodchenko subjected form to function: the circles become
the dominant motif in designs for fabric and tea sets.
</P>
<P>
   A similar path can be traced in Rodchenko's use of diagonals,
which again originate in the floating forms of Malevich's more
elaborate Suprematist works, are distilled and systematized into
the fanning lines of ``Construction No. 89 (on Light Yellow)'' of
1919 and become representational in many of his best-known
photographs: the tilting plunging images, shot from above above or
below, of buildings, trolleys and people in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Next is a phase in which Rodchenko moves increasingly toward
mass communication, often in collaboration with Mayakovsky.
Illustrating Mayakovsky's poem ``Pro Eto'' he echoes the clotted,
jumbled photomontages of the German Dadaists Hannah Hoch and Raoul
Hausmann. But the two friends also collaborated on advertisements
for Mossel'prom, the state-owned grocery-store chain, and Dobrolet,
the state-owned airline.
</P>
<P>
   For the latter, Rodchenko designed posters, stationery, lapel
pins, stock-offering brochures and the company insignia of a black
and red biplane, creating what is, in effect, an early example of a
coordinated advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Mayakovsky, who once defined advertising copy as the highest
form of poetry, wrote propagandistic texts announcing that Russians
who didn't own stock in Dobrolet were not true communists.
</P>
<P>
   Not everything they did together was so ideologically loaded:
one of the show's few emotional hot spots are Rodchenko's
photographs of Mayakovsky, his angular features and confrontational
stare reminiscent of sculptor Richard Serra, himself a latter-day
Constructivist.
</P>
<P>
   Rodchenko was swept up in revolutionary ideals from such an
early age that when the Revolution turned sour, he seems not to
have had much to fall back on, at least not enough to help him face
reality. The conventional photojournalism in the exhibition's final
section exceeds the usual distortions of propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to regain official favor, Rodchenko made three trips
to photograph the construction of the White Sea Canal, where gulag
conditions were killing 10,000 workers a month. This fact, which
must have been unavoidable, was not touched on in either his images
or his letters home. The workers, described as criminals in the
magazine that published these photographs, were in fact simply
``enemies of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   None of Rodchenko's work made after 1935, when he took up
painting again, are included here, which is unfortunate because it
might have revealed more about the man himself. It is intriguing to
read in the catalog that he began painting images of clowns and
circuses. The circus had been a childhood passion, and the return
to them suggests a case of arrested development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alexander Rodchenko'' is at the Museum of Modern Art, 11 W.
53rd Street, Manhattan, through Oct. 6. It will travel to the
Kunsthalle Duesseldorf (October-January, 1999), and the Moderna
Museet, Stockholm (March 6-May 24).

JAZZ FESTIVAL REVIEW: THE SOUTH IN SOUNDS AND IDEAS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., N.Y.)   (bl)  
 By PETER WATROUS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The musical fertility of the black South during the
first half of the century, though it shaped the pop music of the
world, has mostly fallen out of the public consciousness, at least
in a direct way. But Olu Dara and Cassandra Wilson, who performed
at Carnegie Hall on Tuesday night as part of the JVC Jazz Festival,
went directly into the culture.
</P>
<P>
   They're both from Mississippi, and both used blues and jazz
ideas, melodies, rhythms, songs and tonalities to reimagine a past
that for the most part doesn't exist anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Dara sang ``Bubber (If Only)'' _ for Bubber Miley, the cornetist
in Duke Ellington's early jungle band _ and he made a joke about
the two people in the audience who knew of him. He sang ``Rain
Shower,'' using blues melodies, and ``Harlem Country Girl,'' about
taking walks around New York with a woman he liked.
</P>
<P>
   There's something laconic and relaxed about him, and it obscures
Dara's talent as a music maker; he's so intent on creating a mood,
usually of a good time, that how he gets to the mood is overlooked.
He played cornet, and on one tune he walked into the audience,
finding people to play too; the hall's acoustics let him be heard,
unamplified. The music, lodged between jazz and blues and pop and
loaded with archaic details, was there to remind people that
culture can be lost and forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wilson appeared next, and her show moved from standards like
``Surrey With the Fringe on Top'' and ``Old Devil Moon'' to blues
pieces by Robert Johnson and Son House. Backed by a quartet, she
improvised, using jazz ideas, blues moans, pop and gospel music,
filling the gaps between melodies with texture.
</P>
<P>
   In the past Ms. Wilson has often relied on the sound of her
voice to move listeners; she can be inarticulate. But Tuesday the
words and her melodies were in order, and the conception, her
ability to merge disparate styles and ideas, was working. She was
dramatic, and her talent finally made even her conception
irrelevant; the emotional response she elicited was, finally, what
was important.
</P>
<P>
   And she was elegance on two feet, her improvisations curling
like spiraling cigarette smoke. She changed textures, and dropped
notes into the basement of her range. The way she moved emphasized
her melodies, and she turned music into motion. When she sang the
words ``love is blindness,'' it was easy to understand what she was
singing about.
</P>
<P>
   She knew, at least for that moment, the relationship between
sadness and knowledge and that just the act of knowing eased
whatever pain the narrator might have; she shared it with the
audience.
</P>

WHAT IS A FEMINIST? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A majority of American women don't want to be
called feminists, according to a new poll. Who can blame them?
</P>
<P>
   What is a feminist anyway? That once-proud word has been
distorted over two decades so much that no one really knows what it
means any more.
</P>
<P>
   Resistance to the label by ordinary women doesn't necessarily
mean they are turning against the struggle for equal rights or
rushing to conform to the Southern Baptist Convention's new decree
that a wife should ``submit graciously to the servant leadership of
her husband''.
</P>
<P>
   It reflects confusion over how to define feminism itself rather
than ingratitude for the opportunities created by the women's
movement. Many advocates of women's rights have veered from the
original goal of reforming society by ending gender discrimination
in the workplace, marketplace and home. Now they are preoccupied
with female sexuality and the liberation of individual egos and
libidos.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us old-fashioned types, however, believe that bad taste
is not a requirement of feminism. A woman's private sex life is
nobody's business and is irrelevant to the basic cause of retaining
and consolidating the cultural and economic gains we have won.
</P>
<P>
   This current detour into erotic self-absorption is a reflection
of the fact that many women now take for granted their equality
with men and feel free to focus less on political and legal issues
than the early feminists did.
</P>
<P>
   But it is premature to relax. The religious right is still
trying to undermine our new freedoms by crusading, in subtle and
not-so-subtle ways, for women to cradle babies, tend to their men
and return to a humble position by the hearthstone.
</P>
<P>
   The poll by Time magazine and CNN reported that 65 percent of
women surveyed did not consider themselves feminists. Only 32
percent had a favorable impression of such women while 43 percent
had an unfavorable impression.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this image problem, the majority surveyed credited
feminists as working for serious causes such as equal rights, equal
pay, abortion rights, sexual harassment laws and affordable day
care.
</P>
<P>
   Yet only 48 percent _ less than half _ said feminism today is
relevant to most women. A mere 28 percent said it is relevant to
them personally. And 37 percent said feminists don't like most men.
Something is going wrong here.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, as the legal crusade for equal rights was in its
infancy, and the early 1980s, as it matured, there was no ambiguity
about the meaning of ``feminism.'' The 1984 Democratic presidential
nominee Walter Mondale _ having just picked Geraldine Ferraro as
his running mate and the first woman to appear on a major party's
national ticket _ proudly called himself a feminist.
</P>
<P>
   Webster's Collegiate Dictionary describes feminism as ``the
theory of the political, economic and social equality of the
sexes.''
</P>
<P>
   The patronizing ``theory'' bit aside, we old-timers still agree
with that definition and identify feminism with the social changes
that have expanded women's choices and opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The bad old days of overt discrimination in everything from job
pay to lines of credit are largely gone. Women still earn less
money than men and are underrepresented in corporate boardrooms. We
never did get a constitutional amendment guaranteeing our rights.
But pent-up fury over our unfair treatment has given way, on the
part of some women, to a cultural indulgence in obscene and
self-asserting female behavior.
</P>
<P>
   In a cover story dramatizing its poll findings, Time magazine
makes a big fuss about the ``frivolization'' of feminism.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine cites an appalling list of sexually explicit and
tasteless books, music and teen-oriented magazines written and
promoted by women who are celebrating their gender by demeaning it.
</P>
<P>
   Among others, Monica Lewinsky typifies the new female arrogance.
Although she was just a young White House intern, she wrote a
letter to President Clinton _ the leader of the free world, mind
you _ saying ``I want you in my life.'' She was thinking of
herself, not of him. This was not a request; it was a selfish
demand.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan is notorious for nurturing liberal foolishness,
including sensationalized sideshows. Time reports that at a New
York City theatrical reading of something called ``The Vagina
Monologues'' even that mature, wonderful actress Glenn Close got
into the spirit of the new mood by offering a ``homage'' to an
obscene word for female genitalia. Say it isn't so, Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, female goofiness in New York does not reach very
far beyond an insular circle of limited influence. The radicals do
not speak for anyone but themselves. They have little to do with
true feminism, no matter how they may masquerade as its leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Feminism is about empowerment in all aspects of life, not simply
through private sexual pleasure. It is about independence,
intelligence, emotional stability and cultural worth. It is about
seeking for women that which men have always had _ an opportunity
to demonstrate personal merit in a chosen rather than socially
imposed way.
</P>
<P>
   But it may be too late to rescue the word from its present
contorted image. If so, serious advocates of women's rights would
be politically wise to call themselves something else.
</P>
<P>

beginning Monday, June 29. Her column will resume July 6.)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or
noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York
City. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``BULWORTH,'' starring Warren Beatty, Halle Berry and Oliver
Platt. Directed by Beatty (R, 108 minutes). A revitalized Beatty
directs this political satire with jubilant wit and energy, playing
the ultimate limousine liberal with comic panache as a white
politician suddenly turned homeboy (and turned on to black urban
culture and a passionately liberal agenda). Taking a potentially
cheap fish-out-of-water gimmick and making it deeply, disarmingly
funny, he returns to the anything-goes tradition of 1970s dropout
comedy. As the fretful, spin-controlling aide to Beatty's wayward
senator, Platt is uproariously sly (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``COUSIN BETTE,'' starring Jessica Lange and Elisabeth Shue.
Directed by Des McAnuff (R, 108 minutes). Balzac's great novel of
1840s Paris, like Tom Wolfe's ``Bonfire of the Vanities,'' of which
it is an obvious forerunner, is far too big and sprawling to be
compressed into a film of average length. The gifted theater
director McAnuff, making his feature-film debut, has staged the
novel's greedy social climbing and revenge as a cartoonish
``Masterpiece Theater'' spoof in which an avaricious courtesan (Ms.
Shue) and an ambitious young sculptor (Aden Young) who wreak sexual
havoc are charmless buffoons. Ms. Lange is grimly opaque as a
vengeful, scheming cousin who manipulates these narcissists into
destroying the aristocratic relatives who have humiliated her
(Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``GODZILLA,'' starring Matthew Broderick and Hank Azaria.
Directed by Roland Emmerich (PG-13, 139 minutes). The ads for
``Godzilla'' proclaim that ``size does matter.'' But it turns out
that bigger doesn't necessarily mean better. The animatronic lizard
that rises from the ocean and stomps on New York City landmarks has
thundering metallic footsteps but the impact of a weightless
cartoon monster. The movie doesn't get scary until halfway through,
when the beast's eggs hatch (in what's left of Madison Square
Garden) and an army of more lifelike baby Godzillas threatens to
devour the search party. The storytelling and acting in this $120
million wad of gummed-up popcorn reaches new depths of crudeness
and ineptitude for a so-called ``event movie'' (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``HAV PLENTY,'' starring Christopher Scott Cherot and Chenoa
Maxwell. Directed by Cherot (R, 105 minutes). Cherot not only
directed, wrote and edited this amusing, lighter-than-air screwball
comedy about contemporary buppie-mating rituals but also stars, as
Lee Plenty, an affable, self-effacing and broke young writer
secretly in love with a snooty rich girl named Havilland Savage
(Ms. Maxwell). Most of the story is set in Washington over a New
Year's holiday in which Havilland and her well-heeled friends
exchange stingingly funny one-liners, while Lee comments wryly to
the camera. The movie is flawed with a pat, tacked-on ending
(Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``HENRY FOOL,'' starring Thomas Jay Ryan, James Urbaniak and
Parker Posey. Directed by Hal Hartley (R, 138 minutes). The
affectless precision of this filmmaker's previous work is
absolutely no preparation for the brilliance and deep resonance of
this contemporary parable. Without forsaking the clean, spare look
and hyperreal clarity that are his trademarks, Hartley moves into a
much larger realm with a meditation on, among other things, art,
trust, loyalty, politics and popular culture. When Henry Fool
(Ryan) bursts mysteriously into the thankless life of Simon Grim
(Urbaniak) and urges this silent garbage man to start writing, the
results are strange and sublime. Ms. Posey plays Simon's slatternly
sister with nonchalant wit in one of her best roles. A few
glaringly scatological touches don't detract from the film's
elegance of vision (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``HIGH ART,'' starring Ally Sheedy and Radha Mitchell. Directed
by Lisa Cholodenko (R, 96 minutes). Ms. Sheedy gives a fierce,
tricky performance in the role of a once celebrated photographer
spooked by fame who long ago retreated from the art world to live a
reclusive, druggy life among lesbian friends. This steamily intense
story follows her spider-fly relationship with Ms. Mitchell's
bright-eyed, ambitious ingenue, who works for a desperately stylish
photography magazine. Ms. Cholodenko's seductive, powerfully
atmospheric first feature explores their relationship with
intelligence and avidity. But it sacrifices any hope of raw edges
and real emotion to its own chic sensibility, which proves so
studiously alluring that it overwhelms the story. Patricia Clarkson
does a scene-stealing turn as Ms. Sheedy's lover, a glamorously
decadent German actress who never got past the Fassbinder years
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE HORSE WHISPERER,'' starring Robert Redford and Kristin
Scott Thomas. Directed by Redford (PG-13, 164 minutes). There's a
blunt soap opera of a movie inside Nicholas Evans' widely popular
novel. But Redford, directing himself for the first time, with
intelligence and restraint, has found a visually eloquent way to
turn it into something much more thoughtful and tranquil.
Magnificently photographed by Robert Richardson, this film is a
wide-screen love affair with the West, and a story more of peace
and healing than of ardor. Though it's long and its resolution is a
problem, this is an enveloping film that richly rewards the

   ``THE LAND GIRLS,'' starring Catherine McCormack, Rachel Weisz
and Anna Friel. Directed by David Leland (R, 112 minutes). A
sentimental valentine to the Women's Land Army, the legion of young
women dispatched across Britain during World War II to assume jobs
vacated by fighting men, this film presses familiar nostalgic
buttons but not so aggressively that it makes you feel queasy. Good
girl Stella (Ms. McCormack); bad girl Prue (Ms. Friel), and nerdy
academic Ag (Ms. Weisz), women from varying backgrounds, share
cramped quarters on the same Dorset farm where they plow fields,
milk cows and have their romantic turns with the owner's frisky
son, Joe. Rich with period detail and atmosphere, the movie leaves
the inner lives of its characters largely unexplored to paint a
heroic canvas of romantic turmoil and noble self-sacrifice
(Holden).

   CHINA-LEADERS _ BEIJING _ The enigmatic Chinese leadership that
awaits President Bill Clinton is like a carriage hitched to three
galloping stallions: one sturdy, one limping, one flashy. Loping
along behind the ruling troika is a well-groomed yearling that few
outside China have ever heard of. If one of the three lead horses
falters, this fresh horse looks ready to make his move. Why not
become your own amateur China-watcher? Just tune in events over the
next two days and scrutinize these four big steeds of the Chinese
Communist Party politburo. You can bet that every professional
China follower around the world will be glued to the coverage of
Clinton during his 21-gun greeting at Tiananmen Square and the
banquet later in the Great Hall of the People. They'll be watching
for bits of byplay, body language and facial expressions to gain
insight into such questions as these: How will these four cunning
survivors of a generation of sometimes deadly party intrigue
interact with each other, and with the Clinton entourage? Which of
the three leading rivals-in-harness really pulls the most weight?
Are they pulling in different directions? Who will be ``in'' and
who will be ``out'' by the year 2000? (Albright , Cox News

   TOBACCO _ WASHINGTON _ The House task force on tobacco will
unveil their plan Thursday to cut down on the some 3,000 teens who
start smoking every day. The GOP proposal, largely seen as an
attempt to give Republicans cover in the fall elections, is a
scaled down anti-teen smoking bill. Sources say there will be
provisions to allow FDA regulation of tobacco, but it will be a
much narrower bill than the one killed by the Senate. For example,
it is not expected to call for a price increase to pay for the wide
range of programs proposed by the McCain bill. Will get reaction
from health care community. Also will include a look at how the
Republicans and Democrats are vying for control over a host of
issues they think will resonate in the public such as health care,
tobacco, and campaign finance. (Carr, Cox News Service).

other prison gangs and, authorities say, the growing web of murder
and mayhem that those groups are spreading across Texas. Soon, a
Senate committee is scheduled to open a hearing in the Senate

   EVERGLADE-RESTORATION _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The federal plan

   ``THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO,'' starring Kate Beckinsale and Chloe
Sevigny. Directed by Whit Stillman (R, 112 minutes). Stillman's
smart, fretful, patrician characters turn up midway between
``Metropolitan'' and ``Barcelona'' in a film that charmingly mixes
post-college career worries with improbable discomania. A
delightful cast engages in nonstop flirtation and hair-splitting
debate, rendered with Stillman's usual acuity and humor. Ms.
Beckinsale, an English actress with a flawless American accent here
and diffidence that's just as perfect, holds court beguilingly at
the center of a bright and amusing crowd. The ideal film for anyone
willing to entertain the notion that the spread of environmentalism
was sparked by the revival of ``Bambi'' during the disco
generation's formative years (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``MARIE BAIE DES ANGES,'' starring Vahina Giocante and Frederic
Malgras. Directed by Manuel Pradal (R, 90 minutes). Filmed on the
French seacoast around Nice, this debut feature is a gorgeous
cinematic tone poem about the erotic savagery of youth. At the
center of the film, whose cast largely consists of young nonactors,
is a brooding, sensual 15-year-old girl named Marie (Ms. Giocante),
testing her sexual powers. Taken up, then cruelly abandoned by a
group of American sailors, she ends up sharing an idyll with a
petty thief and kindred spirit named Orso (Malgras). The story
isn't much, and the movie's sense of time is confused. But the
film's vision of teen-agers as beautiful baby sharks strikes a deep
and disturbing chord (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``MULAN,'' with the voices of Ming-Na Wen, Eddie Murphy and B.D.
Wong. Directed by Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft (G, 86 minutes).
Disney takes a sledgehammer to the subject of gender stereotyping
in this film, which not only breaks the cross-dressing barrier but
also ratchets up the violence level for children's animation. This
is the most inert and formulaic of recent Disney animated films,
right down to the jokey sidekicks, would-be ``Under the Sea''
production number and Destiny ballad from the intrepid heroine
(``When will my reflection show who I am inside?''). Murphy's very
funny wisecracks make the character of a little dragon
entertaining, but this black-sounding character is also treated as
a servile clown. The animation mimics live-action crowd scenes more
often than it takes audiences to the realm of the imagination
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``A PERFECT MURDER,'' starring Michael Douglas and Gwyneth
Paltrow. Directed by Andrew Davis (R, 107 minutes). The characters
may be cardboard-thin in this film, a skillfully plotted update of
Frederick Knott's play (and Alfred Hitchcock's film) ``Dial M for
Murder,'' but the nasty cat-and-mouse games they play are icily
amusing. Douglas, looking more than ever like a wattled, riled-up
rooster, is Steven Taylor, a shady Wall Street bond trader in deep
financial trouble who hires his rich wife's handsome lover, a con
man posing as a painter, to murder her. It's not as easy as he
hopes. Ms. Paltrow, looking chic and twinkly, is the wife, Emily, a
translator at the United Nations, who has her own agenda. The story
takes enough surprising twists to keep you engrossed, and the
high-style ambience (especially the Taylors' Fifth Avenue
apartment) is mouthwatering (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``SIX DAYS, SEVEN NIGHTS,'' starring Anne Heche and Harrison
Ford. Directed by Ivan Reitman (PG-13, 146 minutes). This escapist
romance for the Treadmill Generation is a workout in its own right,
putting its stars through the wringer (and into a ``From Here to
Eternity'' surf clinch complete with hiking boots). The leads are
attractive and funny, and the screenplay strives for a
Tracy-Hepburn dynamic, but this truly strenuous love story is as
long on tropical scenery as it is short on new ideas. Once the
stars are marooned in splendid isolation, the film has to cook up
pirates and a snake in Ms. Heche's shorts just to keep afloat. In
supporting roles, David Schwimmer makes a drippy beau for Ms.
Heche; Temuera Morrison deserves his own pirate picture, and the
ex-grocery clerk Jacqueline Obrados torches up the film as if Salma
Hayek were in town (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE TRUMAN SHOW,'' starring Jim Carrey, Laura Linney and Ed
Harris. Directed by Peter Weir (PG, 104 minutes). The ultimate in
high-concept ingenuity. Hosannas and cartwheels for this ingenious
media-age fantasy are over the top, but by comparison with
Hollywood's usual notion of summer movie fare, it's definitely a
dazzler. Carrey, refreshingly free of shtick, gives an instantly
iconic performance as a guinea pig for an entertainment-happy
nation, a man whose whole life is a fraud contrived by Harris'
so-called ``televisionary.'' Carrey's innate edge of volatility
gives the material, from a screenplay of transfixing sci-fi
intensity, its trace of danger. Ms. Linney, as the actress playing
a wife whose bluff could be called at any moment, is the story's
spookiest character as well as its perkiest. Weir unifies the
story's many nuances with great finesse (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE X-FILES,'' starring David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson.
Directed by Rob Bowman (PG-13, 115 minutes). Conspiracy theorists,
consider this: What if the hush-hush atmosphere and Internet mania
surrounding the first ``X-Files'' feature film were part of a giant
scheme to hide the uneventfulness of a summertime sci-fi fizzle?
It's as possible as much of what this spinoff film has to offer. If
devotees of the television series approach the film with enough
baggage for a six-week safari, maybe they can deepen the experience
of watching a middling action-adventure with brand-name appeal. But
this film will strike true X-fanatics as watered down and remains
fairly bewildering to the uninitiated. And no, Scully and Mulder
don't quite take their working relationship to a higher plane
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   Film Series
</P>
<P>
   ``LA VIE D'ARTISTE.'' Who inhabits the garret, the stage, the
film studio and the music hall when not roaming the streets of
Paris? Why, painters, poets, musicians, actors, filmmakers and
musical hall performers, of course. Not only do they roam the
streets of Paris, but they will also come to life on the screen of
the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center in this film series,
beginning Friday. Focusing on artists of all sorts, the series
includes works by Jean Renoir, Marcel Carne, Rene Clair, Francois
Truffaut, Marc Allegret, Maurice Pialat, Jacques Rivette and Ettore
Scola, among others. It opens with two Renoir classics Friday and
Saturday: ``La Carosse d'Or'' (``The Golden Coach'') from 1952,
starring Anna Magnani and adapted from the Prosper Merimee play
about a tempestuous actress, and ``French Cancan,'' starring Jean
Gabin in the story of the Moulin Rouge and the dance that made it
legendary. ``La Vie d'Artiste'' continues through July 16 at the
Walter Reade Theater, 165 W. 65th St., (212) 875-5600.

POINTING UP THE WRY SIDE OF THE INDIAN CLASH WITH WHITES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By GRACE GLUECK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``We don't serve Indians,'' a waitress said to two
Indians as they sat in a diner just outside their Mesquakie
settlement in Tama, Iowa. ``We don't want Indians,'' replied one of
them. ``We want cheeseburgers.''
</P>
<P>
   This story, which involves his father, is told by Duane Slick of
Sauk-Fox ancestry, one of 38 artists whose work appears in the wry
and illuminating contemporary show, ``Indian Humor,'' at the
National Museum of the American Indian.
</P>
<P>
   Including the anecdote in a catalog statement about his art,
Slick sees the fast, funny cheeseburger zinger as the kind of
equalizer used by Indians to arm themselves against the put-downs
of white America.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the strongest theme of the show is the clash of
American Indian values with those of the contemporary world _
specifically, the white world _ and how Indians deal with being, so
to speak, low men on the totem pole in a country they still see as
a bastion of colonialism. Every topic that touches on Indian-white
contact is ripe for gibes, from the Bureau of Indian Affairs to
television to casinos, even.
</P>
<P>
   The show, organized by American Indian Contemporary Arts, a
nonprofit center in San Francisco, must certainly be a first in the
annals of Indian-white relationships. One of its primary aims is to
counter ``the popular notion that Indians are stoic and serious,''
writes Janeen Antoine (Sicangu Lakota), executive director of the
San Francisco center, in the catalog preface.
</P>
<P>
   A contribution directly assailing that notion is the cartoony
lithograph, ``Lady in Waiting'' (1987) by Robert Freeman
(Dakota-Luiseno), who describes himself as a creator of ``Indian
babes,'' rather than ``typical Indian maidens.''
</P>
<P>
   In this work a voluptuous young thing wearing sunglasses, a
feather headdress, clunky ``Indian'' jewelry and not much else sits
before a tepee in whose suggestive opening can be glimpsed a large
television. Behind her clumps of giant phallic cacti stretch back
to a string of idyllic blue mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Fake ``Indian'' tchotchkes, toys and nostalgia are satirized by
Joanna Osborn-Bigfeather (Cherokee-Mescalero Apache) in ``May I
Serve You? Cultural Artifacts'' (1994) and Bently Spang (Northern
Cheyenne) in ``The Beginning of the End for the End of the Trail''
(1994). Kay Walkingstick (Cherokee-Winnebago) has produced
``Talking Leaves: You're an Indian?'' (1993), a book of comments
made to her over the years by whites. Next to a lively
self-portrait in pseudo-Indian dress, for instance, appears the
remark, ``You're an Indian? I thought you were a Jewish girl from
Queens who changed her name.''
</P>
<P>
   George Blake's (Hupa-Yurok) ``Hang Around the Fort Injun''
(1993) is an over-life-size carving in painted redwood of a
long-haired brave smugly dressed in white man's clothes and a Stars
and Stripes necktie. ``Hang around the forters,'' Blake explains,
were Indians who ingratiated themselves with white officials sent
to govern them from headquarters in fortlike buildings on the
reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Acting as servants, scouts, Indian policemen and so forth, the
hang-arounds wound up working for the Bureau of Indian Affairs
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also themes that are peculiarly Indian, like the
folk hero Coyote, a trickster who embodies the devilish side of
human nature. (Could he be the inspiration for the Wile E. Coyote
character in the ``Road Runner'' film animation series?) A
quintessential survivor who adopts many guises, Coyote looks out
for himself. He likes to play jokey pranks, but he is also a sly,
hard-biting dog.
</P>
<P>
   In Slick's work, ``Coyote Television Bookpiece'' (1994), Coyote
lurks in mock television screens and the pages of books, making
fleeting appearances to jeer at the distortions of Indian culture
by the mass media.
</P>
<P>
   In three paintings by Harry Fonseca (Maidu) done from 1987 to
1993, Coyote turns up as a vaudeville Uncle Sam, a hipster in a
black leather jacket and a saint surrounded by clouds and flowers.
On the other hand, Jean LaMarr (Paiute-Pit River) portrays Coyote
as a woman, addressing the issue of male-female inequality that is
by no means confined to Indian communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Coyote'' (1992), a leering coyote wall mask that wears an
earring and a rose on its head, goes so far as to suggest that
women can be tricksters on a par with men.
</P>
<P>
   In the artists' humor there is often the angst of seeing ancient
traditions eroded. Funny as it sounds, ``The Zen Electric Jingle
Dress Dancer: The Sound of One Jingle Jangling'' (1994), by Arthur
Amiotte (Oglala Sioux), is a gentle lament for the disappearance of
Indian craftsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   In the painting, an Indian dancer is seen in a flashy ceremonial
costume bedizened with sequins and rickrack, wearing on her head a
sort of tennis cap adorned with tiny American flags. While he means
his painting to be amusing, Amiotte writes, ``it also represents
something of the shoddiness that has replaced the fine and
delicately wrought traditional techniques.''
</P>
<P>
   Beadwork, as a symbol of ancient Indian traditions now degraded,
is very much part of the show. Take Marcus Amerman's (Choctaw)
``Iron Horse Jacket'' of 1993. On the back of a nail-studded black
leather motorcycle jacket, he has embroidered a kitschy rendition
of Brooke Shields, something of an innovation in that the tiny
beads, traditionally used in abstract patterning, here create a
realistic image.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of this sole white pop culture figure also
suggests, in a roundabout way, the absence of Indians from the mass
media.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Larson Bread (Southern Blackfoot) uses her mastery of
beadwork to comment on the inroads of white culture. In ``Traveling
Through Indian Country'' (1994), she has beaded a white travel
pouch on the front with a design reflecting onetime Indian control
of a large piece of American geography.
</P>
<P>
   On the back, she uses clan patches with Indian tribal symbols
separated by lots of white space to indicate the sparseness and
separation of Indian communities today.
</P>
<P>
   Like most group shows, ``Indian Humor'' is uneven, and it
contains material that is not altogether accessible if you're not
an Indian. But it has real punch and a refreshing absence of
polemics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth remains that there hasn't been much to laugh about
in Indian country since contact'' (an Indianism for the historical
confrontation with white Europeans), writes the show's curator,
Jolene Rickard (Tuscarora) in the catalog. ``The irony is that it
almost seems an unnatural task to share a joke with the continually
colonizing `west.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But by sharing these jokes, ``Indian Humor'' sets up a beguiling
approach to Indian attitudes and feelings, of which most other
Americans are sadly unaware. See it and laugh. &QL;

HOUSE REPUBLICANS OUTLINE SKINNY ANTI-SMOKING BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A week after Senate Republicans killed sweeping
anti-smoking legislation, House GOP leaders on Thursday outlined a
scaled-down bill to persuade teens not to smoke and urge states to
lift the driving licenses of teens who do.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Deborah Pryce, R-Ohio, who headed a House Republican task
force that drafted the outline, provided few details about how the
plan would work, saying that no decisions have been made about how
much it would cost or who would pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   She said detailed legislation would be written by committee
chairmen over the July 4th recess, which begins Friday and ends in
mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP leadership outline urges states to enact laws penalizing
minors who smoke by suspending their drivers' licenses and
requiring them to perform community service.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was vague about the future powers of the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration to regulate tobacco, though it specifically
urged that the FDA have the power to regulate cigarette
manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   The outline, which didn't mention any tax hikes to discourage
smoking, appeared to have been timed so that Republican lawmakers
could return to their districts over the July 4th recess and point
to the outline as evidence that they are trying to do something to
combat teen smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers face a potential public backlash because
Senate Republicans took the lead last week in killing tough
anti-smoking legislation managed by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. That
bill would have raised the price of cigarettes by at least $1.10 a
pack, expanded the federal government's ability to regulate tobacco
advertising and marketing and imposed financial penalties on
cigarette makers if they failed to reduce teen smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The House GOP outline was considerably less ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   Under the GOP plan, the director of the White House office of
drug policy _ the ``drug czar'' _ would launch an anti-smoking and
anti-drug publicity campaign, Pryce said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to show kids that smoking is dumb,'' Pryce said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, a member of the House leadership and
a smoker himself, said the bill would seek to reduce underage
smoking, but he added: ``Teen-agers are going to smoke. It's one of
those rites of passage, if you will.''
</P>
<P>
   Boehner also said the bill would not settle lawsuits against
tobacco companies by state attorneys general or offer the industry
any protection from lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not our business,'' Boehner said in an interview.
``This is an ongoing effort to go after what the American people
want.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan also would allow states to keep any money they win as a
result of lawsuits against the tobacco companies, if their legal
fees are ``reasonable'' and ``documented.'' Those suits typically
seek reimbursement for state health-related costs, such as Medicaid
payments.
</P>
<P>
   House Democratic Leader Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo., denounced
the Republican plan as ``an unprincipled attempt to spare tobacco
companies from effective regulation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of penalizing the tobacco companies for marketing
their deadly wares to kids, they want to punish the kids who
smoke,'' Gephardt said. ``This is a classic case of blaming the
victim instead of the perpetrator.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt said the Republican plan fails to give full authority
to the FDA to regulate cigarettes, fails to propose penalties if
tobacco companies don't curb teen smoking, and fails to restrict
the industry from marketing to children.
</P>
<P>
   Long-time tobacco foe Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., called the
House Republican plan ``a sham'' designed to provide Republicans
with political cover in the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fraud,'' Waxman said in an interview. ``But worse, it's
a step backwards.'' Waxman said the Republican plan only
``pretends'' to give the Food and Drug Administration jurisdiction
by allowing it to regulate cigarette manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a payback to the tobacco companies for the $12 million
that Republicans have received in political contributions since
1995,'' Waxman said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. James V. Hansen, R-Utah, who has sponsored a tough
anti-smoking bill along with Waxman and Rep. Marty Meehan, D-Mass.,
that would boost the price of a pack of cigarettes by $1.50, was
more positive about the Republican leadership's plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leadership proposal is only a very rough skeleton,''
Hansen said. ``I think we can work this out.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said in an interview that the House GOP proposal falls
short in several areas. For example, McCain said revoking driving
licenses of teen smokers would do little to stop tobacco use by
those too young to drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you do with 15, 14, 13 and 12-year-olds?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also said he is skeptical that any anti-smoking bill
would discourage underage smoking unless it hikes tobacco prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know of no one who believes that you can effectively address
the kid's smoking issue without raising the price of cigarettes,''
McCain said.

 &HT;    Gulf between 2 worlds: Deaf actor's crossed that bridge
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Considered one of the foremost deaf performers in the United
States, Howie Seago has worked as an actor, director and producer
for two decades. In the film ``Beyond Silence,'' now playing, he
portrays Martin, the deaf father of a hearing daughter. An Oscar
nominee for best foreign film of 1997, the German drama charts the
attempts of parents and child to bridge the gulf between the
hearing and nonhearing worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Seago, who lives in Seattle, answered questions about the film
by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was your childhood anything like Martin's, in terms of
barriers to communication?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. There were many similar parallels. I was not allowed to
use sign language while growing up. This method does not always
work for all deaf children and I strongly believe that American
Sign Language should be used with deaf children for all purposes,
educationally and socially. I feel that I missed out on a lot when
growing up. I do have a good, loving family and appreciate all that
my parents provided for me. I just wish that they had and would now
learn to sign so we can communicate more naturally and efficiently.
My father is a minister, now semi-retired. There is a parallel
between my father's passion for religion and Martin's father's
passion for music, both taking precedent over the son's needs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you worry that director Caroline Link, a hearing person
with no direct experience with deaf people, might not get the story
right?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, at first when she faxed me about my interest in doing
the film. I told her that to be culturally and politically correct,
she should cast German deaf in the roles. I thought she might have
been naive about the differences of the cultural and linguistic
aspects of deafness between countries. Then she faxed back a
four-page, very well-articulated explanation that showed me she had
done her homework. So next I requested and read her screenplay and
was convinced to do it. And it improved throughout the process.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It seems that ``Beyond Silence'' has strong parallels with
your own life, since you're the father of two hearing boys. Did
your personal experience influence the script of the film?
</P>
<P>
   A: Maybe in some small ways. It was so long ago and so much has
happened since then that I don't recall just how much influence I
had on the script. I do know my personal experience did influence
my performance of the role, naturally.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did you get into acting?
</P>
<P>
   A: My first deaf college roommate recruited me to perform in a
sign language play. At first I was petrified, as my ASL skills were
still rudimentary, but he explained that I would just have to learn
and repeat my lines for every show. That it would not be an
extemporaneous presentation. Ummmm ... heck, why not? Then after
the performances, people would approach me with compliments in sign
language and I had to tell them to slow down or repeat. They were
shocked that my ASL skills were different from what I presented
onstage. I thought that was neat. Also I enjoyed getting into the
mentality of someone who is different from what I am in real life.
So I was hooked. Since then, I have learned a lot about life and
humanity by playing an interesting range of characters.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you do for fun?
</P>
<P>
   A: My favorite recreation is cross-country skiing and kayaking.
I like to play with my kids and read novels. I also have a theater
troupe called Deaf Moose Theatre that I enjoy performing in
occasionally as a ``hobby'' with my younger deaf brother and
youngest son.

 &HT;    A `Cousin Bette' to reckon with
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Based on Honore de Balzac's 1846 novel, ``Cousin Bette'' is a
deliciously tart comedy of ill manners and worse morals that slowly
ripens into a revenger's tragicomedy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1840s Paris, the rich are getting richer while the poor are
getting, well, revolutionary. The well-off pamper themselves while
purposely ignoring the unruly mobs of hungry and homeless gathering
around them. Think ``The Bonfire of the Vanities'' (the book, not
the movie).
</P>
<P>
   Against this precarious social backdrop, Balzac spins a tale of
revenge as implacable as it is sweet. But purists beware; the
filmmakers have whittled his novel down considerably, so if you're
looking for an unwaveringly faithful rendition, this isn't it. It's
more of a showcase for a memorable performance by Jessica Lange and
an excuse for well-known stage director Des McAnuff to apply his
theatrical flair to the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   The film begins with a mordantly funny deathbed scene. Inside
the richly appointed Hulot home, Adeline (Geraldine Chaplin), the
mistress of the household, is dying. The family doctor makes sure
to hand her his bill before she succumbs, while her foolish,
philandering husband, Hector (Hugh Laurie), swears he'll never
cheat on her again (gee, about five minutes of utter faithfulness).
And then there's Adeline's sister, Bette (Lange), who promises her
sibling that she'll take care of the family. She does, sort of the
way Lizzie Borden took care of her parents.
</P>
<P>
   A bitter, 40-ish spinster, Bette has spent her life in her
sister's shadow. (``A family like ours could only push forward one
girl,'' she says, trying to sound gracious. ``Your beauty benefited
us all.'') But once Adeline is dead, Bette gets a final-straw shock
that we won't spoil here. Suffice it to say that Bette's passive
resentment becomes active scheming.
</P>
<P>
   While seeming to be the epitome of selfless helpfulness and good
will, Bette plots to destroy the entire silly, shallow Hulot
family. Her primary instrument of destruction will be Jenny Cadine
(Elisabeth Shue), a burlesque star who's more courtesan than
chanteuse. Jenny, whose many admirers include Hector, becomes
friendly with Bette. ``You will be the ax and I will be the hand
that wields you,'' Bette says.
</P>
<P>
   There are many complications, ranging from Hector's insipid son
(Toby Stephens) to the lustful lord mayor (Bob Hoskins), who thinks
his money can buy him anything. But the film's focus is always on
Bette. Dowdied down to look like Mrs. Danvers in ``Rebecca,'' Lange
plays her with a tight-lipped fury so seethingly convincing you're
never quite sure how far she'll go. More to the point, you realize
that Bette herself isn't sure how far she'll go. She is, as Peter
Finch so famously put it in ``Network,'' mad as hell and not going
to take it anymore. But boy, is she going to dish it out.
</P>
<P>
   There are moments when you feel that ``Cousin Bette'' should be
more darkly angry than devilishly arch. McAnuff has diluted some of
Balzac's bitter human comedy and therefore lessened its power. But
his artful cast and wicked tone are hard to resist. As Jenny's
musical director tells her in rehearsal, ``You're singing about
lust and seduction. Put a little crocodile in it.''
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty of crocodile in ``Cousin Bette.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cousin Bette''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jessica Lange and Elisabeth Shue. Directed by Des
McAnuff. Rated R for sex (intercourse, oral sex) and nudity. 1
hour, 48 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A wicked comedy of revenge.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Almost 60, `Wind' remains a force
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rhett Butler was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, my dears, we still do give a damn about Scarlett,
Melanie, Mammy, Ashley, Tara, Bonnie Blue's pony and all the rest.
After almost 60 years, ``Gone With the Wind'' remains the essential
Hollywood movie. Not a happy fluke such as ``Casablanca'' or a
maverick vision such as ``Citizen Kane,'' but a superbly crafted
apogee of Hollywood's Golden Age.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the most profitable movie in history. No small thing
in an era when a movie's entire reputation rests on its opening
weekend grosses. Translate those 1939 dollars, as well as all the
money earned in subsequent re-releases, into 1990s bucks, and
``Titanic'' becomes an also-ran. The American Film Institute
recently voted ``GWTW'' one of the best American movies ever made.
</P>
<P>
   Producer David O. Selznick's masterful adaptation of Margaret
Mitchell's Civil War best seller returns to theaters today in a
spruced-up version. New Line Cinema, a division of the Ted
Turner/Time Warner media empire, has spent a reported $1 million to
restore ``Gone With the Wind'' to its original glory.
</P>
<P>
   Just what does this state-of-the-art overhaul mean? Well,
Godzilla hasn't been added to the burning of Atlanta, and Forrest
Gump doesn't show up at Belle Watling's. There are no ``lost''
scenes, no rediscovered director's cut. Mostly, this is a chance
for older fans and for a new generation to experience ``Gone With
the Wind'' on the big screen, something that, aside from perennial
summer screenings at Atlanta's Fox Theatre, hasn't happened since
the film's 50th anniversary celebration in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Technically speaking, what's most noticeable are the digitalized
improvements to the picture's original Technicolor process. The
colors are more vibrant, thus reintroducing us to the genius of
William Cameron Menzies' production design and Walter Plunkett's
costumes. At the famous Atlanta benefit, for example, the stark
black clothing of newly widowed Scarlett (Vivien Leigh) and her
scandalous dance partner Rhett (Clark Gable) stands out
astonishingly against the Confederate pale grays and the Southern
belle pastels. The contrast gives the scene more power.
</P>
<P>
   Max Steiner's famous, Oscar-nominated score (it lost to ``The
Wizard of Oz,'' but ``GWTW'' won best picture and eight other
Oscars ) has been digitally remastered. Many of the smudges and
scratches accrued over decades of revival-house screenings have
been erased. One flaw: In trying to approximate the picture's
original aspect-ratio (it has to do with width vs. height), some
clarity has been lost.
</P>
<P>
   But even though it remains an outstanding example of studio
craftsmanship at its peak, ``GWTW'' has never been about
technology. It's about Scarlett and her battle to survive the war,
win back Rhett, save Tara. It's about immortal characters and an
enduring story. The movie's racism remains unavoidable. Hattie
McDaniel (Mammy), Oscar Polk (Pork), Everett Brown (Big Sam) and
Butterfly McQueen (Prissy) give tremendous performances; in fact,
McDaniel became the first African-American to win an Oscar. But
they were, are and always will be variations on the ugly ``happy
darkie'' stereotype.
</P>
<P>
   I made a deal with myself decades ago to never forget the
picture's inherent racist context. But I also realized that
condemning ``Gone With the Wind'' for its civil rights and wrongs
would be like judging ``The Godfather'' solely on its attitude
toward women, or evaluating ``Lawrence of Arabia'' only in terms of
its Arab stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gone With the Wind'' is a myth. A myth of Old Hollywood as
much as a myth of the Old South. The ``vanished civilization'' that
Ben Hecht wrote of in his celebrated introduction to the film
(which, apparently, Mitchell never much cared for) is the 1930s as
much as the 1860s.
</P>
<P>
   Times change, yet ``Gone With the Wind'' remains rooted in our
nation's collective movie memory. A harmonic convergence of a South
that never really was as imagined by a Hollywood that will never be
again. The movie has been worshipped; it has been reviled. Either
way, it has never been forgotten. It remains what it always was: a
grand illusion. Perhaps the grandest of them all.

 &HT;    Ricci takes `Sex' to a nasty level
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Christina Ricci has been a talent to reckon with ever since she
stole scenes from Raul Julia and Anjelica Huston in the two
``Addams Family'' movies.
</P>
<P>
   In the acerbic, yet strangely sweet, black comedy ``The Opposite
of Sex,'' she's at the heart of a smart ensemble that includes Lisa
Kudrow (``Friends''), Martin Donovan (``The Portrait of a Lady'')
and singer Lyle Lovett.
</P>
<P>
   Ricci plays Dedee, a foul-mouthed teenage tart who flicks a lit
cigarette into her stepfather's grave and takes off to find her
half brother Bill (Donovan). Bill is, as Dedee observes in her
archly bitchy narration, ``like, dozens of years older than me and
an actual real-life homo.'' Bill has an actual real-life homo
lover, a dim-bulb pretty boy named Matt (Ivan Sergei), whom Dedee
easily seduces.
</P>
<P>
   A virtually unrecognizable Kudrow plays Lucia, the repressed
schoolteacher sister of one of Bill's former lovers. She takes
Dedee's shenanigans as a personal affront to his memory. Then, as
Dedee warns us, ``Things get very complicated very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Beneath ``Sex's'' black humor and self-conscious plot twists is
a heartfelt look at relationships _ especially, but not
exclusively, gay relationships _ in the late 1990s. Writer-director
Don Roos, whose screenwriting credits have been good (``Love
Field''), not too bad (``Single White Female'') and really ugly
(the ``Diabolique'' remake), turns out to be a true believer when
it comes to the love thing.
</P>
<P>
   Most of ``Sex'' is nasty, however, with Ricci setting the tone
and pace as the hard-hearted heroine whose unabashed me-first
approach keeps the plot going full speed. She's outrageous, yet
captivating. And she always gives us fair warning: ``If you think
I'm plucky and surprising and all I need is love, you're in over
your head.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Opposite of Sex''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Christina Ricci, Martin Donovan and Lisa Kudrow.
Directed by Don Roos. Rated R for vulgar language, sexual
situations, nudity and sexual references. 1 hour, 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Christina Ricci's teenage harlot burns a hole in
the screen.

 &HT;    ``Silence'' moral: Children must learn to separate from their
parents without cutting them off.
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a longtime fan of classic horror movies, I couldn't help but
think of Lon Chaney, the original Phantom of the Opera, throughout
the fine new German film ``Beyond Silence.'' Like this picture's
protagonist, he was the hearing child of deaf parents. But in his
case, a childhood spent using sign language enhanced his career as
a silent film star. In ``Beyond Silence,'' our heroine's gift
pushes her further from her parents.
</P>
<P>
   We meet Lara (Tatjana Trieb) as a bright, vivacious 8-year-old.
Adept at sign language, she is her parents' (hearing-impaired
actors Howie Seago and Emmanuelle Laborit) crucial link to the rest
of the world. She acts as interpreter and, sometimes, as protector.
Negotiating between her father and an unhelpful bank officer, for
instance, she wisely tempers her dad's more irate comebacks.
Conversely, she's not above using her translating skills to her
advantage. Say, softening a teacher's more critical comments during
a parent-teacher session.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs is a tight-knit, happy family. That is, until the day
Lara's glamorous Aunt Clarissa gives her a clarinet. The girl's
affinity for the instrument is immediate. Almost as immediate as
her father's growing fear and disapproval. Not only is music one
area he cannot share with his beloved daughter, but the gift
revives old sibling resentments he has against Clarissa.
</P>
<P>
   Rather abruptly, the movie cuts to 10 years later, when the
nearly adult Lara (Sylvie Testud) must choose between her family's
dependency and her growing desire to study at a Berlin
conservatory. It's a universal situation. The tensions that arise
when a child strikes out on her own are made more poignantly urgent
by her parents' hearing impairment.
</P>
<P>
   An Oscar nominee for best foreign language film (it lost to
``Character''), ``Beyond Silence'' is a lovely, sensitive movie
that lacks dramatic cohesion. Somehow its two halves fail to fit
together. But filmmaker Caroline Link has given us characters who
concern us, and she has cast them well (especially the two Laras).
And if the tear-jerker father-daughter ending is exactly what we
expected, it's also satisfying because it's exactly what we wanted
to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond Silence''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tatjana Trieb and Sylvie Testud. Directed by Caroline
Link. In German with subtitles. Rated PG-13 for brief nudity.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A film worth listening to.

 &HT;    Olivia de Havilland, the lone surviving star of the classic
Civil War epic, ``Gone With the Wind'', reminisces .
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York--She once was ``traded'' for Jimmy Stewart in a manner
impersonal enough to make most modern-day ballplayers quake in
their Nikes.
</P>
<P>
   She jeopardized her career in a landmark court case and dubbed
``Scarlett O'Hara's'' retching sounds when Oscar-winner Vivien
Leigh just couldn't manage to do it for herself.
</P>
<P>
   Juicy tidbits all, and yet nothing Olivia de Havilland disclosed
in a conversation here was anywhere near as fascinating as what she
let drop about Hollywood back in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole town was bored with `Gone With the Wind','' de
Havilland, 81, recalled with just the hint of a twinkle in her eye.
``They thought it was going to be the biggest flop in history and
they didn't care. No film had ever cost $4 million before, there
was not a chance we would ever recoup that, and no one (in
Hollywood) was sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   It all seems somewhat unbelievable now, given ``Wind's''
Scarlett-esque penchant for surviving _ even thriving _ against
seemingly insurmountable odds. Producer David O. Selznick ran out
of money midway through filming Margaret Mitchell's big, beloved
novel, and some of the other films competing with it for ticket
sales that year were ``The Wizard of Oz,'' ``Stagecoach'' and ``Mr.
Smith Goes to Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even while she was filming her role as the loyal, long
suffering Melanie Wilkes, de Havilland sensed ``Wind'' would
somehow turn out to be ``different.'' In fact, it's immortal. The
sprawling Civil War era epic de Havilland optimistically thought
might stick around in the public's mind for as long as 10 years was
recently ranked No. 4 on the American Film Institute's list of the
all-time greatest American films. And today, nearly 60 years after
it had its glittering premiere at the Loew's Grand Theater in
Atlanta, the digitally-remastered and Technicolor-restored version
of ``Gone With the Wind'' reopens in theaters.
</P>
<P>
   If Georgians were beyond excited over the premiere (A minor
player's arrival by train was as momentous as the Confederates'
``firing on Fort Sumter,'' the Atlanta Journal wrote), the cast was
feeling all that and more. Three days of visits to Cyclorama and
the Junior League Ball culminated in a motorcade before one million
screaming fans to the theater on the icy cold night of Dec. 15,
1939. De Havilland recalls thinking that Selznick's decision to
hold the premiere in Atlanta was ``clever,'' but also ``risky.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, how you wanted the Southerners to accept it!'' de
Havilland said emotionally. ``Because it was about their city and
their ancestors.''
</P>
<P>
   When the reviews in Atlanta were glowing, Selznick and company
marched north.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next opening was in New York and those Yankees liked it,
too,'' de Havilland recalled with delight. ``So we got the South,
we got the Yankees and then the West Coast followed right along!''
</P>
<P>
   For nearly three decades now, the two-time Academy Award-winning
de Havilland has been the film's only surviving star. So you'll
have to forgive her for having become a bit sentimental last week
when she watched the sprawling epic for the first time in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really like a reunion,'' de Havilland said softly about
seeing Leigh, Gable and her on-screen husband, Leslie Howard, again
in all their youthful glory. ``It was thrilling to be with them
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she'll forgiveyou for finding irony in the fact that
Melanie was the only major character to die in the film _ a weak
constitution having finally accomplished what the combined forces
of Yankee invaders and Scarlett's jealously ingenious machinations
could not.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, as de Havilland happily points out, she's still
here. Just in from Paris, where she's lived for the past 45 years,
she's coolly elegant in a silk print dress, her snow-white hair
upswept in a smooth chignon. She's both a throwback to a more
gracious era, changing her ``look'' frequently for the benefit of
competing media outlets, and refreshingly modern enough to admit
that she's having a blast with all this renewed attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be there for the 70th anniversary (of ``Wind's''
release) and I'd like to make the 80th,'' de Havilland admits with
none of Melanie's characteristic Southern reserve. Maybe by then,
one film scholar suggests, de Havilland's performance will have
finally gotten its due. Leigh deserved the Oscar she won for her
larger-than-life Scarlett, but Melanie really was the ``hard part''
to play, said Jeanine Basinger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scarlett gets to be modern and selfish and mean and all those
good things,'' said Basinger, author of ``A Woman's View: How
Hollywood Spoke to Women'' and chair of Wesleyan
University(Conn.)'s film studies program. ``Melanie has to be
virtuous and do the least rewarding part. Nobody identifies with
her. Everybody identifies with the smaller, more jealous, sexier
Scarlett O'Hara.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody, it seems, wanted to play Scarlett, a role for which
Selznick spent three full years auditioning actresses. Except de
Havilland. Ask her if she ever wanted the career-making part and
she barely gets out an urgent ``Nope! Nope!'' before launching into
a description of her growing up years in Depression-era northern
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that I was going to have to earn my own living and be
self-reliant and independent and self-supporting,'' said de
Havilland. ``And when I made `Gone With the Wind,' that's exactly
what I was. So was Scarlett. So I was leading that life, and so
that didn't interest me at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Noted film critic Molly Haskell says de Havilland's earlier
roles as a Warners contract player made her about as unlikely a
choice to play Scarlett as, well, Clark Gable.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wasn't the most beautiful. She was the nicest. That's what
she played,'' Haskell said about the then 22-year-old, non-glamour
queen best known for playing the sweetly virginal Maid Marion
opposite Errol Flynn's dashing Robin Hood. ``She was refined and
ladylike and women liked her because she wasn't the sort of person
who would steal someone's husband.''
</P>
<P>
   But the seeds of change were already being sown when Warners
grudgingly loaned de Havilland to Selznick for ``Wind.'' She
received a supporting actress Oscar nomination (she lost to co-star
Hattie McDaniel), but immediately after found herself back playing
the same sort of roles at Warners.
</P>
<P>
   In 1943, de Havilland decided to sue to get out of her contract,
which was typical for performers in that era. It represented a huge
gamble on de Havilland's part. No other studio could employ her
while the case was being litigated.
</P>
<P>
   When she won the so-called ``de Havilland Decision,'' she
recalled, she received cards of thanks and flowers from numerous
other actors. Scripts poured in from other studios and by 1949,
she'd won two best actress Oscars for ``To Each His Own'' and ``The
Heiress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That decision was due to her courage and perseverance and her
sense of self as someone who should not be owned,'' said Basinger,
pointing out that Bette Davis had already tried to break free of
the studio system and failed. ``She's a woman with a lot of grit. I
think you're dealing with a Melanie-like personality _ someone who
puts her foot down and stays with it because it's right, not
because it's easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, studio head Jack Warner had never really known what he
was dealing with when it came de Havilland. A few years earlier,
when he wouldn't release her to play Melanie, de Havilland had
secretly invited his wife to tea at the Brown Derby. She'd begged
the former actress to speak to her powerful husband on her behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``He let me go,'' de Havilland recalled, a devilish grin giving
way to hearty peals of laughter. ``In exchange for Jimmy Stewart
and a certain sum of money, of course. It was not altogether
altruistic!''
</P>
<P>
   It's an only-in-Hollywood type story about a movie which, de
Havilland suggested, couldn't be more removed from the place. In
the end, she said, ``Gone With the Wind'' has always belonged in
and to Atlanta. That's why she and Leigh returned in 1961 to help
mark the Civil War Centennial and why she whooped in delight last
week at hearing about the oft-proposed ``Gone With the Wind'' theme
park. And it's why she nodded understandingly when told of the
legions of tourists who still pour into Atlanta looking for the
mythical Tara.
</P>
<P>
   More than almost anyone, perhaps, Olivia de Havilland ``gets''
``Gone With the Wind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a story of defeat and renaissance, of survival and
rebirth,'' the film's last remaining, and arguably its best-cast
star said softly. ``That has eternal appeal.''

 &HT;    `Land Girls' muddied by melodrama
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   During World War II, which Prime Minister Winston Churchill
called his nation's ``finest hour,'' everyone in England pulled
together to save the world from Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   The new movie ``The Land Girls,'' directed by David Leland,
focuses on Britain's equivalent of Rosie the Riveter. When
England's farmers traded their overalls for uniforms, young women
volunteered to take their places and keep the country fed. Thus we
meet three single city girls ready, willing and able to get all
mucked up in the name of king and country. Their war zone is a
dairy farm in Dorset. Their commander, so to speak, is a taciturn
farmer who isn't overjoyed with what the government thinks are
suitable farmhands.
</P>
<P>
   His new workers are a mixed lot. Stella (Catherine McCormack) is
a soulful, strong-willed beauty with a fiance in the service. Ag
(Rachel Weisz) is an upper-crust type, snobby but ultimately
lovable. Prue (Anna Friel) is the earthy one who knows that
haylofts are good for more than storage.
</P>
<P>
   The lushly beautiful English countryside holds up its end, and
there's an inherent fascination in this little-known slice of
history. But ``The Land Girls'' isn't just set in the 1940s; it
could easily have been made in the 1940s. Its old-fashioned
approach to character and story is mildly bothersome at first, then
downright irritating. The three leads act like silly twits, and
it's difficult to become involved with them.
</P>
<P>
   You can't fault the cast, especially McCormack, who was so
dazzling in ``Dangerous Beauty.'' But despite the actors' efforts,
the picture feels clumsy and manipulative, much like a
run-of-the-mill romance novel. Leland had a hit about a decade ago
with ``Wish You Were Here,'' another period piece. In retrospect,
you have to wonder if that movie's sparkle had more to do with star
Emily Lloyd.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Land Girls'' comes off as more outlandishly soapish than
genuinely affecting. It's a missed opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Land Girls''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Starring Catherine McCormack, Rachel Weisz and Anna Friel.
Directed by David Leland. Rated R for sex (intercourse). 1 hour, 55
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Not anyone's finest hour.

 &HT;    This caper's a sight better than most
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's easy to believe that Jack Foley has 200 bank robberies
under his belt. And other kinds of conquests, too. As played by
George Clooney, he knocks over a Florida SunTrust with a sunny,
seductive ease that makes the bank teller respond to his ``have a
nice day'' exit with ``You, too.''
</P>
<P>
   In the crooked world of ``Out of Sight,'' Foley's courtly
professionalism raises him above a sea of small-timers who figure
no crime is too crazy to attempt, no jackpot too puny for the risk
it entails. Jack is methodical, intelligent, addicted to his job.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for Karen Sisco (Jennifer Lopez), a federal
marshal whom we first spy girlishly enraptured by the handgun her
dad (Dennis Farina) has bought for her birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Karen and Jack have a few other things in common: They don't
always have perfect days in their chosen lines of work. That
explains why Jack lands behind bars (not for the first time). And
why Karen winds up kidnapped by him on the night he makes a
jailbreak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest,'' she shouts.
He tosses her into the trunk of her own car and climbs in as his
pal Buddy (Ving Rhames) guns the gas.
</P>
<P>
   In a Hollywood lousy with meet-cute scenes, this one's a doozy.
And it has novelist Elmore Leonard's genre-bending fingerprints all
over it. In outline, he's given us a screwball romantic comedy. It
just happens to be propelled by firepower, betrayal, bloodshed _
and the erotic gravitational pull between Clooney and Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   The movie quickly gets Karen out of that trunk and sends her and
Jack on separate, but linked, paths. He plans his next robbery, she
a way to bust him. But our main concern is when and how they'll get
together. It's a '90s ``Romeo and Juliet,'' but what's keeping them
apart is their work.
</P>
<P>
   After some not-great movie adaptations (``52 Pick-Up,'' etc.),
Hollywood has figured Leonard out, most notably with ``Get
Shorty.'' It seems that the slightly absurd, postmodern realities
of the '90s have come to reflect his savory stew-plots, simmering
full of pungent characters and odd spices.
</P>
<P>
   Jack's ex-wife (Catherine Keener) answers the phone carrying a
white rabbit; she's a magician's assistant. For another character
in ``Out of Sight,'' clumsiness is more than a quirk; in a
sick-humor payoff, it becomes a matter of life or death. Like
playwright David Mamet, Leonard creates an alternative universe
that looks realistic but is highly stylized.
</P>
<P>
   Director Steven Soderbergh knows to play the film as a fable,
underlining the visual contrasts when the action skips from sunny
South Florida to snowy Detroit. The narrowing plot involves a
white-collar ex-cellmate of Jack's (Albert Brooks) and a fortune in
uncut diamonds. But the main pleasure comes from the movie's
digressions, such as a scene in which three businessmen take turns
trying to pick up Lopez at a hotel bar.
</P>
<P>
   As for the stars, Clooney and Lopez each get to prove their
street credentials, facing down various thugs. (Lopez's response to
a guy who invites her to ``tussle'' is a classic of self-defense
minimalism.) So do the actors make us believe they're a con and a
fed? Not even close. It doesn't matter: They're sexy and magnetic
in the old-school style of movie stars, floating on the shoulders
of the film's rich supporting cast.
</P>
<P>
   That cast is the best thing about the flick, with every role
filled by an interesting actor. Rhames and Brooks are their
reliable selves, while Steve Zahn steals all his scenes as a
doped-up felon who gets stuck working with Jack's old jailhouse
nemesis, Maurice ``Snoopy'' Miller. Don Cheadle makes that
character all the scarier by downplaying his ruthlessness.
</P>
<P>
   The movie isn't perfect. It's too long, and toward the end it
meanders when it should be tightening up. So it's not totally outta
sight, but ``Out of Sight'' is still an unexpected adult pleasure
in a silly, shallow summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of Sight''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Starring George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez. Directed by Steven
Soderbergh. Rated R for language. 2 hours, 9 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Another shaggy winner from the brain that cooked up
``Get Shorty.''

 &HT;    Stores hoping new products to become people's pet projects
 &HT;    By Bette Harrison
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA--Browsing through the national Pet Products Trade Show,
which opened Thursday at the Georgia World Congress Center, we
sampled some new things that may turn up in pet stores soon:
</P>
<P>
   -- Wordy Birdy, by Wordy Birdy Products. $30. Want to teach
Petey to talk but don't have the time? Wordy Birdy is a tape
recorder that stays on indefinitely (or until the batteries run
down). Just record what you want Petey to say, then leave the
gadget running and running and running. If Petey isn't driven
insane, in a month or so he might be repeating the message himself.
</P>
<P>
   -- The CatFinder, by Pet Friendly. $40. ``They can run, but they
can't hide,'' says the packaging for this product, a radio-remote
doodad that attaches to kitty's collar. The manufacturer also
suggests using it to find car keys, TV remotes and cordless phones.
Wouldn't it be great if it worked on teenagers, too?
</P>
<P>
   -- Aqua Dog, by Black Sheep. $8-$15. Fluorescent pink, orange,
yellow and green life preservers for dogs.
</P>
<P>
   -- Fool-A-Bug, by Alternative Control Systems. $3-$6. According
to the manufacturer, the patented design of a Fool-A-Bug bowl
messes up insects' navigational systems so they move on to greener
pastures.
</P>
<P>
   -- Emergency Feeding Kit, by Pet-Ag. $7. A small package
containing everything needed to feed an orphan kitten, hamster,
raccoon, badger, porcupine or other small animal. The kit also
includes a guide to ``saving little lives.''
</P>
<P>
   -- The Canine Oral Hygiene Machine, by TheraFlow. $150. A Water
Pik-type device for doggies.
</P>
<P>
   -- Quantum, by Mensa Products. $7. You know those embarrassing
moments when you're sitting on the couch with your significant
other, when suddenly a malodorous scent fills the air and everyone
looks at Precious? Quantum claims to be the first internal stool
and urine deodorizer for cats. Enough said.
</P>
<P>
   -- Serenity Pet Casket. $35. It's pretty, lined with blue satin
and holds any deceased loved ones weighing up to 15 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   -- The ActivityTower, by Petmate Pro Kat Furrniture. $179.
Salvador Dali meets George Jetson in this zany, stylish play tower
for kitties, with integrated toys and sleeping alcoves. The
furniture line includes sleeping beds that look like dripping TVs,
chairs and bureau drawers.

AGASSI, CAPTRIATI LEFT WITH THEIR MEMORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Andre Agassi is saying, ``Life doesn't wait for you,''
and Jennifer Capriati is saying nothing that enlightening, just
packing her bags and wondering how she could lose to somebody ready
for Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   He's right, she's bewildered, and those Sisters Sledgehammer _
Venus and Serena _ are what's happening at Wimbledon if you're
talking about latter-day bundles to Britain from the USA.
</P>
<P>
   It's not so far back that the ``Jenerator'' _ Jenny Capriati _
was throwing off sparks and power around this place, bumping off
the champ, Martina Navratilova, and perching in the semifinals. She
was 15. It was 1991. Or that Andre Agassi was making rubber lemons
magically vanish with his gut-strung wand as foes scuttled about
feverishly and vainly trying to find them. He was 22, the new
champion. It was 1992.
</P>
<P>
   A twinkling ago, but a century in sports. Jenny and Andre were
the child phenoms of their day _ Thursdays _ but this time they
were out on the curb among remnants in the Wimbledon discard pile,
along with the empty champagne bottles and the plastic bowls that
contained the signature treat, overpriced strawberries and cream.
</P>
<P>
   Andre was hanging from a very high window sill and Jenny from a
very low ranking when they reported for duty Thursday, an afternoon
subjecting 36,003 parishioners to a blend of rain, sunshine, and
tricky gusts. Once Professor Nick Bollettieri's glittering pupil,
Agassi was left dangling perilously at nightfall Wednesday by his
successor as teacher's pet, 20-year-old Tommy Haas. Haas led, two
sets to one, towering, at 6 feet 2 inches, over Andre in stature
and, surprisingly, in shotmaking.
</P>
<P>
   When they returned to Centre Court for Act II, Haas started
shakily, losing serve. Andre held for 2-0 and had two break points
for 3-0. The old pro was OK. Not for long. Haas, who grew up at the
Bollettieri Academy in Bradenton, Fla., ``looking up to Andre,
admiring him,'' turned on his own muscle and won their Thursday set
to complete a 4-6, 6-1, 7-6 (7-4), 6-4 triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi feels ``there's more good tennis in me. It'll come back
like his form did for Michael Jordan. But it took him a while after
he quit baseball. I have time _ but life doesn't wait.'' It does
when Jordan takes wing.
</P>
<P>
   The dismal facts, however: Agassi has lost his last two starts
to relative nobodies, and these matches happened to be
first-rounders at the French (Russian qualifier Marat Safin) and
now Wimbledon and No. 44 Haas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andre used to play with me once in a while at the academy,''
says Haas, a German, who acts and talks like an American kid but is
billed in the fatherland as the next Boris Becker. ``But I couldn't
stay close to him the first time we played as pros, Scottsdale in
March (6-2, 6-1). So this is very special, to beat Andre on the
court where he won Wimbledon in 1992.''
</P>
<P>
   Capriati, drifting, rudderless, ranked No. 151 and in on a
freebie as a wild card, hadn't passed through the tall iron Doherty
Gates at the All England Club entrance since 1993, when she lost a
tough quarterfinal to the champion, Steffi Graf. It was a last
moment of glory before her personal troubles hijacked the immense
promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, you know, I think my comeback is going well, you know,''
she says, chewing gum and scores of conversational ``you know's.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to be back here after so long. I think I'm playing
even better than in 1991 and 1992.''
</P>
<P>
   The flimsy 4-6, 6-4, 6-2 defeat by another wild card,
34-year-old, downwinding Lori McNeil, testifies otherwise, speaks
of self-delusion.
</P>
<P>
   You feel for Jennifer. Rich, a good kid, but in need of
direction to find out what she really wants. If it is tennis, then
she requires a coach to get her in shape, care about her _ far from
the father who made her the family provider at 13, pushed her and
played her when she was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Products of a different, more careful parental environment,
Venus and Serena Williams are cruising joyfully toward a
fourth-round collision. Venus, setting a female speed record with a
125-mile-per-hour serve for one of six aces _ not many guys can
match that _ beat Barbara Schett, 6-1, 6-2, in her second-rounder.
Serena, in a ``really special moment, my first time on Centre
Court,'' whomped the Croatian teen whiz, 16-year-old Mirjana Lucic,
6-3, 6-0, in 48 minutes, undercutting big sister's clocking by five
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like grass,'' says Serena after merely her fifth
match lifetime on same. ``But it doesn't matter what surface. I
adjust fast. But you know what I don't like about Venus? She's so
much taller than I am (4 inches at 6-2). She can serve faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Venus retorts, with a great smile, ``You know what I don't like
about Serena? She steals my cookies. Oatmeal raisin today. But I
watched her first set. Serena's a juggernaut. I predict the winner
of our match will win the tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   What does it take to beat a juggernaut? ``A nemesis,'' replies
Venus. ``I'm a nemesis.'' Laughter takes over.
</P>
<P>
   Andre and Jennifer can remember when they were juggernauts.

 &HT;    Leonard: Hollywood's bookmaker
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beverly Hills, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Easy Does It'' read the bumper stickers handed out by Alcoholics
Anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   And Elmore Leonard, who's always been forthright about how AA
helped him more than 20 years ago, does it easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just sit down and write the book and it works,'' he says.
``Instead of trying to write the book.'' And he mimes how he looks
when he's trying too hard, hunched over, fingertips downturned and
rigid like monster claws, hovering over an imaginary typewriter.
</P>
<P>
   Walker Percy called him ``the greatest crime writer of our time,
perhaps ever.'' His stories, with their pimp-walk prose and their
lovable lowlife heroes, are oddly structured, always a couple of
narrative bubbles off plumb. But ever since 1985's ``Glitz,''
they've invariably been best sellers, through ``Cuba Libre''
earlier this year, and bound to continue with ``Be Cool,'' the
sequel to ``Get Shorty,'' due out early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been writing for 47 years; I ought to be able to throw
some people together and have something come out of it,'' he says,
sounding a bit side-of-the-mouth insouciant, like one of his
characters, although in a more measured, Midwestern way.
</P>
<P>
   When readers visualize him, it's probably in those American
Express ads from the late '80s, the Annie Leibovitz photo of
Leonard on a beach at sunset, sitting in a straight-back chair,
typewriter in his lap, black cap on his head. Doing it easy.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent sunny L.A. day, though, the godfather of the modern
American crime novel is sitting in a hotel suite in the Four
Seasons Hotel, casually elegant in an expensive-looking
cream-colored sweater over white shirt and bluejeans. (Leonard
describes his characters' wardrobes usually even before he
describes the firepower they're carrying.) He's having a smoke,
tapping the ashes into a china coffee saucer because the room is
ashtray-free.
</P>
<P>
   At 72, he's as focused as a professional hit man.
</P>
<P>
   Saying: ``I always considered myself a commercial writer. I want
a lot of people to read my books. I want to make money doing
this.''
</P>
<P>
   And making money he is. The novels are a good business, but the
big score, the kind his characters are always seeking, comes from
the movies. Leonard sold the rights to 1996's ``Out of Sight'' for
$2.5 million; it opens Friday, starring George Clooney, Jennifer
Lopez and Ving Rhames.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-one of his 34 novels have been made into movies or are
being made into a movie or are optioned, which means Leonard gets
some money whether a movie gets made or not.
</P>
<P>
   Quentin Tarantino, who turned ``Rum Punch'' into ``Jackie
Brown,'' has the rights to film three more Leonard novels. ABC has
a summer TV series based on ``Maximum Bob,'' the novel about a
comically corrupt Florida judge; coming in late July, it stars Beau
Bridges. The Coen brothers of ``Fargo'' fame are adapting ``Cuba
Libre,'' and John Travolta is reading an advance copy of ``Be
Cool'' to decide if he'll reprise the role of Chili Palmer he
swaggered through in ``Get Shorty.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the buzz in Hollywood is that the movie business
``gets'' Leonard. At last. That the days of straight-to-video
schlock and Burt Reynolds smirking his way through 1985's ``Stick''
are long gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott Frank was the first to understand how to adapt Elmore
Leonard,'' says Clooney, referring to the young screenwriter who
wrote the movie versions of ``Get Shorty'' and ``Out of Sight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Screenwriters will just take what the plot is, but Elmore's
plots aren't really that interesting,'' Clooney continues. ``Scott
understood that it was about characters and dialogue, that
everything the characters do is just organic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a nearly Dickensian ability to create major and minor
characters who stretch credulity but never break it,'' says Rod
Cockshutt, who teaches a course on detective fiction at North
Carolina State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who are able to roll with the punches and
look at life with a jaundiced and ironic eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Character and attitude. Tarantino understood the attitude of
Leonard's characters, and the two have a little mutual admiration
riff going. The director likes to tell a story about how, as a
teenager, he ``boosted'' a copy of Leonard's novel ``The Switch''
from a store, and Leonard praised ``Jackie Brown'' more than some
critics did.
</P>
<P>
   Here's Leonard describing how ``Out of Sight'' came to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a picture in the Detroit paper of a woman, a federal
marshal, in front of the courthouse in Miami, with a shotgun on her
hip. Kind of a provocative pose. And I thought, `That's a book.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been thinking about doing a professional bank robber, a
clean-cut bank robber. And get them together and see what happens.
They're both attracted to one another and it's too bad they meet
under these circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then there was a prison break in Palm Beach County in 1995
when six Cubans tunneled out. So I'll have my guy follow them out.
And the girl is there for some reason, and I'll see what happens.
Like all my books, I make it up as I go along.''
</P>
<P>
   For some writers, hearing that their novels sound as if they
were written to be made into movie is a grievous insult. Leonard
brings it up himself, with a chuckle. ``Be Cool,'' which gets
former loan shark Chili Palmer into the rock music business, ``was
obviously written to sell as a movie. No doubt about it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard still lives in Birmingham, Mich. He's lived in the
Detroit area since he was 10, after being born in New Orleans, and
although many of his books reflect a native's knowledge of the
Florida Gold Coast, he's only visited there, never moved in.
</P>
<P>
   Every weekday morning he goes into the living room, which he
converted into his office, switches on jazz (bebop or big band) and
writes; four pages on an average day. He uses a $150 Mont Blanc pen
(he started with a 39-cent Scripto mechanical pencil, he jokes) and
unlined yellow pads that he has specially made at a print shop.
That's what he wrote on when he worked at an advertising agency in
the '50s and '60s, turning out Chevrolet commercials by day and
western short stories at night. (A collection of Leonard's western
shorts, ``The Tonto Woman,'' will be published in September by
Delacorte.)
</P>
<P>
   When the pulp magazines that published his westerns dried up,
Leonard turned to crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't influenced by any crime writers,'' he says. ``I
didn't come out of the Raymond Chandler school. My style developed
with the writers I read and studied, beginning with Hemingway and
then through John O'Hara.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, with a cult following but still nowhere in sight of a
best seller or a major review, Leonard was divorced from his first
wife, Beverly, the mother of his five children, and also
successfully stopped drinking after several attempts with the help
of Alcoholics Anonymous. He has remarried twice (his second wife
died), but he's stayed with his sobriety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally the program caught on, or rather I caught on to the
program and realized what was involved was changing your whole
attitude. I haven't been to a meeting now in 12 years or more, but
I still think about the principles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of not taking yourself so seriously is the first
thing. The idea of not looking at writing as the most important
thing in the world, but just something that I do.''
</P>
<P>
   `` I have a lot of fun watching as the characters come on stage
and become real for me,'' he says. ``They have to be able to talk
or else they're out.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard gets to his talking through listening. Although he
employs a full-time research assistant, he likes to hang out with
cops and listen to the details of their jobs, the little things
like how just the sound of a shotgun being racked will shake most
perps. He has a loose network of contacts, like an old friend who's
a private eye in Miami, who introduced him to the real Chili
Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   The real Chili, like the fictional, was a low-level mob guy who
needed a new, more legit, job when his godfather got whacked. The
real Chili became a legman for the Miami private eye, while the
fictional Chili, largely Leonard's invention, went into the movie
business, was played by John Travolta, and told Gene Hackman, ``I'm
the guy who's telling you the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   That line is pure Leonard: seemingly simple, but in context it
has an undercurrent of m enace and the suggestion of an existential
chuckle. It's pure Leonard because it is Leonard. The guy who's
telling us the way it is.

DELAY LEADS GOP DEFENSE OF FIRED NEW YORK TEACHER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Conservative Republicans led by House Majority Whip
Tom DeLay called for the reinstatement Thursday of a New York City
substitute teacher who was fired for allegedly sharing her
Pentecostal beliefs with her students to help them deal with the
death of a classmate.
</P>
<P>
   The dismissal last week of Bronx sixth-grade teacher Mildred
Rosario provoked an outcry of protest from leaders of the Christian
right, whose demands that Republican leaders take a more activist
role in pushing their ``family values'' agenda has been paying off
lately.
</P>
<P>
   Not only have Republicans embraced the socially conservative
agenda, but they have moved to put much of it into law over the
objections of moderates in the party and some in the business
community who have threatened to scale back financial contributions
to the party if the GOP leadership does not stop courting the
religious right.
</P>
<P>
   Those rumblings did not stop DeLay and other GOP lawmakers from
rushing to Rosario's defense at a news conference with Family
Research Council President Gary Bauer, a leading GOP social
conservative. They also gathered later with Bauer, who is
considering a run for the presidency in 2000, to hail the
introduction in Congress of the Ten Commandments Defense Act, which
would allow the display of individual expressions of religious
faith on government property.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, R-Texas, opened the Rosario news conference by offering a
prayer for the 43-year-old Bronx woman, whom he described as a
``blessed teacher'' willing to put her faith on the line to help
her students.
</P>
<P>
   He called on New York education officials to reinstate her,
saying that she should not have been fired ``for offering comfort
to her students during a time of tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What is it that people object to? What was wrong with bringing
that kind of message to children?'' DeLay asked.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Riley, R-Ala., said the Rosario case was an example of
what he called a ``religious intolerance'' that denies people of
faith the right to express themselves. Riley said it was time for
the nation ``to re-examine its moral soul'' and begin to teach
children that ``God is not a dirty word.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, who called Rosario ``a decent God-fearing woman,'' also
praised the teacher for ``reminding'' her students about ``who made
them'' and ``what the source of their freedom is.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosario, a substitute bilingual teacher, was fired last week
after education officials determined that she had violated
separation of church and state laws by crossing the line between
teaching students about religion and advocating a particular
religious view.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said Rosario had admitted in a statement that she
had promoted her own Pentecostal views of Christianity after being
asked by one of her students if a classmate who had drowned
recently was with God in heaven. According to reports about the
firing, Rosario encouraged the students to ask Jesus to save them
as she walked around the room patting her charges on the head.
</P>
<P>
   By championing Rosario's cause, Republicans are hoping to shore
up what was until just a few weeks ago a shaky relationship with
the party's social and religious conservatives. With control of
Congress hanging in the balance in this fall's mid-term election,
DeLay has been leading the charge to the right as GOP leaders
search for votes.
</P>
<P>
   Voter turnout this year ``is predicted to be one the lowest
ever,'' said one Republican aide, responsible for helping to
maintain the ties between House Speaker Newt Gingrich's leadership
team and the party's social and religious conservatives. The aide
said the ``the conservative wing of the party, the Christian Right
... or whatever you want to call them,'' are among the party's most
loyal supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job is to get them to the polls by reminding them that we
best represent their views,'' he added.

<P>
   (Reviewer's initials appear at end of review). Grades range from
A to F.
</P>
<P>
   Almost Heroes PG-13
</P>
<P>
   A comic version of Lewis and Clark, with Matthew Perry and the
late Chris Farley as mismatched 19th-century explorers. Novel and
giddily silly at first, but simply dopey by the end. Rated PG-13
for brief nudity, strong language and comic violence. 1 hour, 29
minutes. (Newhouse News Service) Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Barney's Great Adventure G
</P>
<P>
   What you've seen is what you get. In his feature debut, Barney
joins three kids in the country on an adventure involving a
mysterious egg. Along with perpetually cheerful Purple One, the
movie offers a parade, a circus, a hot-air balloon race and other
attention-keeping delights. The target audience _ say, the
under-threes _ will be satiated. 1 hour, 15 minutes. (ER) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Silence PG-13
</P>
<P>
   A film worth listening to. Germany's Oscar nominee for best
foreign-language film concerns a musical prodigy who is also her
hearing-impaired parents' crucial link to the rest of the world.
Sensitive and well-acted, the film uses a specific situation to
explore a universal one: how children must learn to separate from
their parents without cutting them off. In German with subtitles.
Rated PG-13 for brief nudity. 1 hour, 45 minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   The Big Hit R
</P>
<P>
   The big ho-hum. Treading territory that ``Grosse Pointe Blank''
covered better last year, ``Hit'' ponders the problems of a
professional killer trying to maintain a domestic life. Mark
Wahlberg plays Mel, a hit man torn between mowing down mobsters and
romancing a girlfriend (Lela Rochon) and a fiancee (Christina
Applegate). Rated R for violence, language, and some sexuality. 1
hour, 33 minutes. (SM) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Bulworth R
</P>
<P>
   Provocative, funny, and unbalanced _ just like politics.
Director, star and co-writer Warren Beatty plays the titular
senator from California, who breaks down while watching his latest
re-election commercials. Hiring a hit-man with himself as the
target, he returns to campaigning, where his meltdown becomes very
public. Rated R for profanity. 1 hour, 48 minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Can't Hardly Wait PG-13
</P>
<P>
   You won't want to wait . . . for the movie to end. This teen
comedy about an end-of-the-school-year all-night party shirks
subtlety whenever a broad stroke will get us there faster. Jennifer
Love Hewitt plays Amanda, the goddess of the just-graduated senior
class. Ethan Embry is the sweet, sensitive guy who, the movie tries
to convince us, deserves to be her boyfriend. Rated PG-13 for
profanity, simulated sex, drug and alcohol use. 1 hour, 38 minutes.
(SM) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Character NR
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 Oscar winner for best foreign language film, this dour
but compelling Dutch import is laden with Dickensian incident and a
Kafka-esque sense of fate. Set in 1920s Rotterdam, it's the tale of
a relentless war waged between a formidable father (Jan Decleir)
and his illegitimate son (Fedja van Huet). Not exactly a
light-hearted romp, but so much happens you barely notice. Not
rated but there is brief sex, nudity and violence. Subtitles. 1
hour, 57 minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   City of Angels PG-13
</P>
<P>
   In this Hollywood-style adaptation of Wim Wender's great film
``Wings of Desire,'' Nicolas Cage plays an angel who wants to trade
in his wings for an earthly fling with a comely hart surgeon (Meg
Ryan). Directed by Brad Silberling (``Casper''). (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Cousin Bette R
</P>
<P>
   Balzac's 1846 novel may have been whittled down, but there's
still much to like about this deliciously tart comedy of
ill-manners and worse morals that slowly ripens into a revenger's
tragicomedy. Jessica Lange stars as the overlooked and
underestimated spinster who devises some elaborate revenge
scenarios for her shallow, wealthy relatives. The artful supporting
cast includes Elisabeth Shue and Bob Hoskins. Rated R for sex and
nudity. 1 hour, 48 minutes. (ER) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Deep Impact PG-13
</P>
<P>
   The impact here is human, which is pretty gutsy since, going in,
we all know this is about a giant comet hurtling toward Earth.
Director Mimi Leder harks back to 1959's ``On the Beach'' in her
determination to show that worldwide catastrophes can be measured
one human life at a time. Her strong cast is headed by Tea Leoni,
Morgan Freeman, Elijah Wood and Robert Duvall. Rated PG-13 for
violence, language and end-of-the-world jitters. 2 hours, 3
minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Dirty Work PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Laughless comedy starring an insufferably smug Norm Macdonald,
the comic who was booted from his slot as ``Weekend Update'' anchor
on ``Saturday Night Live.'' MacDonald plays an allegedly charming
prankster who launches a revenge-for-hire business. Rated PG-13 for
language and comic nudity. 1 hour, 35 minutes. (Newhouse News
Service) Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dolittle PG-13
</P>
<P>
   This raucous but uninspired Eddie Murphy vehicle has almost
nothing to do with the old Rex Harrison musical. Murphy is John
Dolittle, a busy doctor who has neglected his wife (Kristen Wilson)
and his two daughters. One day, all kinds of animals start
pestering him vocally. Despite the zing of some nuttier moments,
the lame plot keeps dragging the movie to the ground. Rated PG-13
for crude humor and language. 1 hour, 30 minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Everest NR
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' This
44-minute documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm
that killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' Cameraman David Breashears
fills the screen with awesome vistas, but discreetly avoids the
piles of discarded oxygen tanks, human waste and frozen bodies that
now litter the trails of the mountain. This is a film whose cruel
beauty manages to celebrate the spirit of the climbers, while
making you question their sanity. (SM) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas R
</P>
<P>
   Too much is never enough for both fabled gonzo journalist,
Hunter S. Thompson, and filmmaker Terry Gilliam. Thus Gilliam's
version of Thompson's 1971 book about his drug-drenched visit to
Vegas has a brilliant first hour and an excessive second one. But
Johnny Depp gives an amazing, uncompromised performance as
Thompson. Rated R for vulgar language, violence and extensive drug
use. 2 hours. (ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Godzilla PG-13
</P>
<P>
   He's back. He's big. He's boring. There was probably no way
Hollywood's extravagant update of ``Godzilla'' could live up to its
year-long hype. What's depressing is how far it falls short from
being even solid summer escapism. Bikini Atoll resident Godzilla
comes to nest in Manhattan when it's time to think of family
matters. Matthew Broderick is a biologist on the monster's trail.
Rated PG-13 for sci-fi action/violence. 2 hours, 19 minutes. (SM)
Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Good Will Hunting R
</P>
<P>
   A feel-good movie from Gus Van Sant sounds like an oxymoron, but
that's exactly what this pleasant, warm-hearted film is. Matt Damon
stars as a math genius who works as a janitor at MIT rather than
fulfilling his potential. Robin Williams is the eccentric
huggy-bear shrink who helps the kid embrace his brains. Damon
co-wrote the script with Ben Affleck and in this case, their excess
of heart is heartening. Rated R for language and sexual situations.
2 hours, 5 minutes. (ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Hav Plenty R
</P>
<P>
   Plays like the first draft of what might have been a good
comedy. Writer-director-star Christopher Scott Cherot is Lee
Plenty. Dateless on New Year's Eve he happily accepts an invitation
to a party from his friend Havilland (Chenoa Maxwell), whom he
secretly adores. Cherot is a likable performer, but he doesn't have
the movie star wattage his role needs. Rated R for language. 1
hour, 32 minutes. (SM) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   He Got Game R
</P>
<P>
   Spike Lee gets it together in this celebration/expose of high
school hoop dreams. Denzel Washington is a jailbird dad who could
earn a reduced sentence if he can convince his hot-prospect son
(Milwaukee Bucks guard Ray Allen) to play for the governor's alma
mater. Not a slam-dunk, but close enough. Rated R for sex, nudity
and language. 2 hours, 10 minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Hope Floats PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Never flies, but never sinks either. Sandra Bullock teams up
with director Forest Whitaker (``Waiting to Exhale'') for this
affecting story of a woman who goes back to her small-town home to
lick her wounds after her husband has an affair. Also stars Harry
Connick Jr. and Gena Rowlands. Rated PG-13 for language and illicit
kissing. 1 hour, 54 minutes. (ER) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   The Horse Whisperer PG-13
</P>
<P>
   There are far worse ways to pass the time than riding the range
with Robert Redford. In this old-fashioned, emotionally satisfying
story, the director/star plays a cowboy whose magic way with horses
has a healing effect on humans, too. Also stars Kristin Scott
Thomas. Rated PG-13 for violence and sex. 2 hours, 48 minutes. (ER)
Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   I Got the Hook-Up R
</P>
<P>
   This inner-city comedy about two street-corner entrepreneurs,
Black (Master P) and Blue (A.J. Johnson), who come into a cache of
cell phones, is so generic, in both style and story, that it could
be an ``In Living Color'' parody. To its credit, there are hardly
any crossed signals here. ``I Got the Hook-Up'' clearly isn't aimed
at ``The Horse Whisperer'' crowd. Still, it's a pretty shoddy
product by any standards. Rated R for extremely vulgar language,
sexual innuendo, comic violence and extensive female nudity. 1
hour, 33 minutes. (ER) Grade: D+
</P>
<P>
   The Land Girls R
</P>
<P>
   More outlandishly soap-opera-ish than genuinely affecting, this
movie about the young women who volunteered to work British farms
during World War II isn't anyone's finest hour. The Dorset
countryside is lushly beautiful, the historical situation
fascinating and the actors (Catherine McCormack, Rachel Weisz, Anna
Friel) good. But it comes off a missed opportunity more than
anything else. Rated R for sex. 1 hour, 55 minutes. (ER) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   The Last Days of Disco R
</P>
<P>
   A disco movie for anyone who wasn't into disco (and maybe even
for those who were). Master cinematic sociologist Whit Stillman
(``Metropolitan'') looks at the young and the restless and the hip
and the privileged in the early '80s whose social lives revolve
around a Manhattan disco. The fine ensemble cast is headed by Kate
Beckinsale (``Cold Comfort Farm''). Rated R for language, drug use,
female nudity and brief sex. 1 hour, 52 minutes. (ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Les Miserables PG-13
</P>
<P>
   A handsome, well-acted version of the Victor Hugo epic ...
though you may miss the songs. Police inspector Javert (Geoffrey
Rush) once again tracks former convict Jean Valjean (Liam Neeson)
through the countryside and alleyways of 19th-century France.
Directed by Bille August (``Pelle the Conqueror''), the movie's
worth a look even if it lacks the novel's breadth and vision. 2
hours, 9 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Lost in Space PG-13
</P>
<P>
   A movie that has all the flash and depth of the latest Nintendo
game. Based on the campy '60s TV show, ``Lost in Space'' throws in
vicious space spiders, genetic monsters, confusing time-travel
elements and heavy doses of family values. There's also Gary Oldman
as the evil Dr. Smith, and ``Friends'' hunk Matt LeBlanc as the
arrogant pilot Major West. Predictably, the movie has an open
ending, suitable for sequels. Rated PG-13 for intense sci-fi
action. 2 hours. (SM) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   The Man in the Iron Mask PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Swashbuckling escapism at its best. Leonardo DiCaprio plays dual
(and dueling) roles in this adventure based on the Dumas novel
about a masked youth, imprisoned by his twin brother, King Louis
XIV and aided by the Musketeers (Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich,
Gerard Depardieu, Gabriel Byrne). Written and directed by Randall
Wallace (``Braveheart''), the movie isn't just for Leo-maniacs; it
has a fine streak of aging-legend melancholy, too. 2 hours, 7
minutes. (ER) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Mulan G
</P>
<P>
   The best Disney animated feature since ``Beauty and the Beast''
and ``The Lion King.'' Based on a 4th-century legend, it's about a
young girl who pulls a National Velvet, i.e., disguises herself as
a boy and goes to battle in her elderly father's place. This isn't
just a grand family film; it's a grand film, period. As Eddie
Murphy's little red dragon says, ``Mulan, you the man!'' 1 hour, 28
minutes. (ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   The Opposite of Sex R
</P>
<P>
   Christina Ricci's teen tart burns across the screen in this
acerbic yet strangely sweet black comedy. The convoluted plot kicks
off when Ricci visits her gay half-brother (Martin Donovan) and
steals his dim-bulb lover (Ivan Sergei). The eclectic (and fine)
supporting cast includes Lisa Kudrow and Lyle Lovett. Rated R for
vulgar language, sexual situations, some nudity and sexual
references. 1 hour, 40 minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Out of Sight R
</P>
<P>
   Another winning adaptation of a book by Elmore Leonard, the
brain that cooked up ``Get Shorty.'' George Clooney plays a courtly
bank robber, Jennifer Lopez is the federal marshal he kidnaps. In
outline, this is a screwball romantic comedy. It just happens to be
propelled by firepower, betrayal, bloodshed _ and the erotic
gravitational pull between the two leads. Rated R for language. 2
hours, 9 minutes. (SM) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Paulie PG
</P>
<P>
   A solid, sweet kid flick. Paulie is a wisecracking parrot (voice
by Jay Mohr of ``Picture Perfect'') who is separated from his
beloved owner, a 5-year-old girl named Marie. The bulk of the movie
is Paulie's picaresque adventures as he goes from one owner to
another, trying to find his way back. ``Paulie'' doesn't have the
magic or emotional depth of ``Babe,'' but it's well-crafted and
provides an ending with a lovely twist that can appeal to kids and
adults alike. Rated PG for brief mild language. 1 hour, 27 minutes.
(SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   A Perfect Murder R
</P>
<P>
   Not perfect, this ``Dial M for Murder'' remake is still a guilty
pleasure, a slick B-movie jazzed up with great clothes, art
direction and decent plot twists. Michael Douglas plays a business
shark whose boom is going bust, so he attempts to hire his wealthy
wife's lover to kill her. Rated R for language, sex and violence. 1
hour, 47 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Quest for Camelot G
</P>
<P>
   This action-packed animated feature is a kid-pleaser with enough
humorous asides to keep adults interested, too. During the time of
King Arthur, a plucky girl dreams of becoming a knight and finds
herself responsible for saving Camelot. Gary Oldman, Don Rickles
and Eric Idle are among the more recognizable voices. 1 hour, 28
minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Six Days, Seven Nights PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Think ``Romancing the Stone'' ... only without the romance or
the adventure. Harrison Ford is a gruff charter pilot and Anne
Heche is a New York magazine editor. They wind up stranded on an
island near Tahiti _ an abandoned place, except for some pirates.
The pair bicker, bond and kick some pirate butt. Rated PG-13 for
sexual entendres and implied sex. 1 hour, 41 minutes. (SM) Grade:
C+
</P>
<P>
   Sliding Doors R
</P>
<P>
   Gets jammed on its own cliches. The gimmick is a pair of what-if
scenarios: what happens if a young woman (Gwyneth Paltrow) makes a
subway train and what happens if she misses it. Paltrow is
appealing, as is John Hannah as the stranger she meets either way.
But essentially, it's a gimmick in search of a story. Make that,
two stories. Rated R for language and mild sex. 1 hour, 35 minutes.
(ER) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish Prisoner PG
</P>
<P>
   More fiendish fun 'n' games with David Mamet. A naive young
inventor (Campbell Scott) is the patsy/hero in a complex confidence
game. Steve Martin is surprisingly good as a well-connected but
mysterious businessman who befriends him. An insubstantial but
deliciously entertaining scam of a movie. Rated PG for language and
mild violence. 1 hour, 52 minutes. (ER) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Species II R
</P>
<P>
   The principal difference between this one and ``Species'' is _
well, there really isn't a difference. Michael Madsen is back,
trying to keep Natasha Henstridge (a clone of the character she
played in the first film) from having sex and spreading alien DNA.
The only real fun is in listening to the audience call out the plot
points before the characters find them out. Rated R for language,
sex and gore. 1 hour, 35 minutes. (Newhouse News Service) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Titanic PG-13
</P>
<P>
   The ship goes down, but the movie stays afloat. Writer-director
James Cameron harnesses Hollywood's latest high-tech tricks to tell
an old-fashioned romance for the gals that doesn't neglect the
guys, either. Kate Winslet plays an upper-crust Philadelphia girl
returning from Europe on the Titanic. Leonardo DiCaprio is a
scrappy artist who has admired her from afar. Rated PG-13 for
disaster-related peril and violence, nudity, sensuality and brief
language. 3 hours, 14 minutes. (SM) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   The Truman Show PG
</P>
<P>
   Jim Carrey's excellent performance is the centerpiece of this
provocative, thoroughly entertaining social satire about a cheerful
insurance salesman who slowly realizes his entire life has been a
TV show and everyone he knows are actors. Peter Weir directs this
dazzlingly executed conceit and the strong cast includes Laura
Linney and Ed Harris. Rated PG for mild language. 1 hour, 44
minutes. (ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Marshals PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Lee Jones returns as U.S. Marshal Sam Gerard in this fine
sequel to ``The Fugitive.'' This time, Gerard's on the trail of an
ex-CIA operative implicated in two murders, played by Wesley
Snipes. While this installment lacks some of the emotional
resonance of the original, it offers an exhilaratingly detailed
look into what it takes to be a fed _ the stakeouts, the video
surveillance, the occasional rooftop runs. Through it all, Jones
attacks his role like a pit bull. He makes single-mindedness seem
like a superhuman trait. Rated PG-13 for violence and language. 2
hours, 11 minutes. (DH) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Wilde R
</P>
<P>
   A dutiful, decorous rendition of a man who was anything but.
This Cliff's Notes version of Oscar Wilde's life gives us Wilde as
playwright, wit and gay martyr, but leaves out the importance of
being Oscar. Still, Stephen Frye gives a tremendous performance in
the title role. Rated R for nudity and sex. 1 hour, 56 minutes.
(ER) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Woo R
</P>
<P>
   An uneven but spirited comedy about trying to find true love
amid a meat-market mentality. Jada Pinkett Smith is the title
character, a woman who's been so burned by the doggy behavior of
guys, she approaches her latest blind date (Tommy Davidson) with
the determination to prove his innate canine drive. Rated R for
language, sex and marijuana smoking. 1 hour, 32 minutes. (SM)
Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   The X-Files PG-13
</P>

   Bigger but not really better. Though the feature film
continuation of Fox's conspiracy-mad TV series offers more gore and
profanity, it never accelerates to that stratospheric level of
action, suspense or awe that we hope for in a summer movie. As FBI
agents Mulder and Scully, David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson take
a smooth step up from television to the big screen. Rated PG-13 for
mild language, gore and violence. 2 hours, 2 minutes. (SM) Grade:
B-

<P>
   Armageddon PG-13

 &HT;    HBO's ``Trumpet'' doesn't dress up this war
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This isn't your father's World War II movie. The ``good war''
gets a post-'Nam rejiggering in HBO's ``When Trumpets Fade'' (9
p.m. EDT Saturday). Call it ``Apocalypse, Then'': a grisly, grimly
chilling trek into the nature of war, bravery, cowardice, survival
_ all the stuff that's large, ambiguous and has life-or-death
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, if I can help you in any way without endangering my own
life, I won't hesitate,'' Private David Manning (Ron Eldard), tells
a superior on a battlefield so desperately dismal he can get away
with saying that. ``But I'm not taking a bullet for anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not good enough,'' his superior answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's as good as it gets,'' Manning says, and that's that.
</P>
<P>
   Manning is his company's lone survivor during the three-month
Battle of Hurtgen Forest in 1944, on the Beligian-German border.
More than 24,000 U.S. troops were killed or wounded during this
barely-known siege, which had little strategic importance and was
called ``the death factory'' by those who fought it (it was largely
forgotten in the wake of the Battle of the Bulge, which began a few
days later). The movie opens with Manning leaving a fellow soldier
in the field to save his own skin, and he now sees survival as his
only goal.
</P>
<P>
   But the prospects for survival here become so dire that Manning
keeps finding himself promoted _ he's one of the few experienced
soldiers in a killing field constantly replenished with fresh human
fodder. Finally, Manning's only way out is heroism.
</P>
<P>
   As directed by John Irvin (whose previous war movies include
``Hamburger Hill'' and ``The Dogs of War''), the bleak landscape is
populated with a terrifically living-dead cast: Zak Orth as pudgy,
fresh meat; Martin Donovan as the captain who follows orders he
knows doom his men; Dylan Bruno as the sergeant who has Manning's
number.
</P>
<P>
   It all moves with a stylized slow-motion that piles tension on
top of itself; battle scenes then flash with severed limbs and open
wounds. It's all at ground level; there are times when you have to
spit the dirt out of your mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The post-modern take on it all only makes the tragedy more
unsettling; when the credits roll over soldiers shuffling through
the battlefied, Bing Crosby croons ``White Christmas.'' It'll break
your heart.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Esposito joins ``Homicide''
</P>
<P>
   Character actor Giancarlo Esposito will join the cast of NBC's
cop drama ``Homicide: Life on the Street'' next season playing the
estranged son of Lt. Al Giardello (Yaphet Kotto).
</P>
<P>
   Although his character is still being fleshed out and hasn't
been named yet, Esposito will debut in the season opener as an FBI
agent assigned to the violent crimes unit in Baltimore where the
show is set.
</P>
<P>
   Esposito is best known for his performances in several Spike Lee
films including ``Do The Right Thing,'' ``School Daze'' and ``Mo
Better Blues.'' He also played a cigaratte smoking G-man on the
trail of Keyser Soze in the Oscar-winning nouveau noir thriller
``The Usual Suspects.''
</P>
<P>
   ``CHiPS'' on patrol...again
</P>
<P>
   Hold onto your handlebars. TNT is reuniting Erik Estrada and
Larry Wilcox for ``CHiPS '99,'' a two-hour update of their 1970s
series (could it have been a drama?) about California motorcycle
cops who headed out on the highway each week accompanied by blaring
disco music. The plotline will go something like this: following a
15-year self-imposed retirement from the California Highway Patrol,
Ponch (that would be Estrada) reunites with Jon (that would be
Wilcox) to break up a car theft ring. What will they ride? BMW
motorcycles. The film, to air this fall just ahead of 1999, will be
directed by Jon Cassar (``Assault on Devil's Island'').

MY MANHATTAN: `A POET'S PARADISE' 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RON PADGETT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the bus came over that final hill in New Jersey,
I got my first real-life glimpse of Manhattan stretched out
broadside like a futuristic battleship 11 miles long, and the surge
of excitement I felt at that moment 38 years ago has never quite
left me.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, everything looks good from a distance. And when I
reached my destination, the Village, I was met with a Whelan's
drugstore and a Howard Johnson's, at Sixth Avenue and Eighth
Street: not all that different from a busy intersection in Tulsa,
Okla., where I had just come from. Where were the thatched cottages
that my fanciful 18-year-old mind had imagined?
</P>
<P>
   My roller-coaster reactions were immediately propelled by the
pace of the streets of Manhattan, not to mention the thrill of
jaywalking. Soon, as Jack Kerouac put it, ``I did everything with
that great mad joy you get when you return to New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   The sheer energy of the streets was irresistible, a force that
made me want to go to the Museum of Modern Art, the Bleecker Street
Cinema, the Eighth Street Bookstore, Wall Street at midnight and a
thousand other places, all at the same time, and then go back to my
room and write a poem.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, I've lost a step, but I still have to contain my
excitement when I go out into the street, because I know that out
there I will encounter an endless stream of little dramas. Every
person who walks toward me, becoming not only larger and larger but
giving an evolving impression, will bring his or her own personal
drama that climaxes as we pass by each other.
</P>
<P>
   Will that pretty woman's eyes meet mine in some mysterious
communication? It's fun to fall in love for only 10 seconds. And
what better place to do so than in the streets of New York? But
there's the other drama, too: Is that guy staggering toward me
because he's drunk, and what's that in his hand? A baseball bat?
And he's wearing a Nixon mask. I go back to my apartment and write
a poem about lunacy (mine).
</P>
<P>
   But even if _ and especially when _ the streets are deserted,
there are the buildings. If I lift my gaze, I will see a curious
architectural detail that I never noticed, even though I have
walked past it thousands of times. For years, the Chrysler Building
sparkled and radiated behind my poems, but for the last 10 years, I
have been entranced by the top of the Con Ed building, illuminated
in subtle colors at night by some genius of lighting so that it
resembles a flying chunk of ancient Babylonia.
</P>
<P>
   For a few years, the demolition of Klein's department store
afforded a magnificent view from Union Square of the entire height
of the Con Ed tower, especially in the early evening. But now the
sightlines are blocked by a new and self-important structure that
makes me grit my teeth. It's like a piece of cardboard nailed over
a Vermeer. I got so hot under the collar over this that I wrote a
prose poem about the joys of anger.
</P>
<P>
   The gutsy verve of New York's streets is echoed by other poets
who have lived in the city. I get a thrill when I read Walt
Whitman's ``I too walk'd the streets of Manhattan'' and his account
of walking along 14th Street. It's a special pleasure to read his
big poem ``Crossing Brooklyn Ferry'' while taking the, well, Staten
Island Ferry. I feel that I belong in New York when I read Edwin
Denby's powerful sonnets about West 21st Street, Sixth Avenue and
the old IND subway line, as well as his hallucinatory ``Elegy _ The
Streets.''
</P>
<P>
   I get a tingly feeling every time I look up at Furnald Hall, a
dormitory on the Columbia campus, because I know that the great
Spanish poet Federico Garcia Lorca, the author of ``Poet in New
York,'' once lived behind one of its windows. I never pass by
Rockefeller Center without thinking of a poem about Christmas in
New York, James Schuyler's heartbreakingly beautiful ``December,''
with its funny opening, ``The giant Norway spruce from Podunk
....''
</P>
<P>
   But for my money, the poet who gets the most out of New York is
Frank O'Hara, whose ``A Step Away From Them'' includes the dirty
glistening torsos of construction laborers, Coca-Cola, pet shop
windows, an electric waterfall, giant smoke rings, a blond chorus
girl, a toothpick, a quotation from Denby, a cheeseburger, three of
Frank's departed friends, a glass of papaya juice, a book by the
French poet Pierre Reverdy and more.
</P>
<P>
   In his relatively short poem, O'Hara gives us all of Times
Square in the late 1950s. It still makes me like Times Square, just
as Ted Berrigan's poem about ``reeling up First Avenue to Klein's''
makes me happy to reel up First Avenue, too, especially the block
between 11th and 12th Streets, whose deep red tenement facades
sometimes take on a supernatural glow at sundown.
</P>
<P>
   And First Avenue will always remind me of bumping into Allen
Ginsberg, whose poetry was one of the reasons I came to New York in
the first place, at Shin's fruit stand late one night. He held up a
tomato and said, ``Ron, at 79 cents a pound, this is a very good
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Where else in the world can all this happen? Is this not a
poet's paradise?
</P>
<P>
   Strawberries In Mexico
</P>
<P>
   At 14th Street and First Avenue
</P>
<P>
   Is a bank and in the bank the sexiest teller of all time
</P>
<P>
   Next to her the greatest thing about today
</P>
<P>
   Is today itself
</P>
<P>
   Through which I go up
</P>
<P>
   To buy books
</P>
<P>
   They float by under a bluer sky
</P>
<P>
   The girls uptown
</P>
<P>
   Quiet, pampered
</P>
<P>
   The sum of all that's terrible in women
</P>
<P>
   And much of the best
</P>
<P>
   And the old men go by holding small packages
</P>
<P>
   In a trance
</P>
<P>
   So rich even they can't believe it.
</P>
<P>
   I think it's a red, white, and blue letter day for them too
</P>
<P>
   You see, Con Ed's smokestacks are beautiful
</P>
<P>
   The way Queens is
</P>
<P>
   And horses: from a pleasant distance
</P>
<P>
   Or a fleet of turkeys
</P>
<P>
   Stuffed in a spotless window
</P>
<P>
   In two days they'll be sweating in ovens
</P>
<P>
   Thinking, ``How did I ever get in a fix like this?''
</P>
<P>
   Light pouring over buildings far away.

BIG DECISIONS FOR THE PREDATORS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ By early Friday afternoon the Nashville
Predators will finally have a bunch of names and faces that will
fill the franchise's shirts for the start of its inaugural National
Hockey League season.
</P>
<P>
   And the names are?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been going over that for months now,'' said Predators
general manager David Poile, the former Washington Capitals boss
who was hired a year ago to steer the expansion club's destiny.
``Based on who we thought would be available, we'd make a list, and
then at the end of every month, we'd tear it up and start over
again, because as deals would occur, everything would change.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes came fast and furious last week as a number of the
NHL's Original 26 conducted what amounted to a shell game sur
glace. There were four netminders moved in trades, including former
Bruin/Capital Bill Ranford, whom the Predators had targeted as
available in the expansion draft. By the weekend, all four had been
protected by their new clubs, leading Poile and his pals to
reconfigure their wish lists and perhaps simultaneously reach for
the jumbo-sized bottle of antacid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had interest in all four of them,'' said Poile, who'll
submit his finalized list to NHL bosses Friday morning and then
attend an afternoon news conference to announce his team. ``Our
plan was to take five goalies _ the maximum we're allowed _ but we
may have to rethink that strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ranford went from Washington to Tampa Bay. Ken Wreggett was
flipped from Pittsburgh to Calgary. Eric Fichaud left the Islanders
for the Oilers. Steve Shields departed as Dominik Hasek's backup
here and now will block pucks, and plenty of 'em, for the San Jose
Sharks. Not all four would have suited up for the Predators, of
course, but a couple of extra worthy netminders would have allowed
Poile to make follow-up deals that could have made his club deeper
at defense and/or forward and better able to compete when the puck
is dropped in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to take anything away from what the Florida Panthers did
collectively as an expansion team,'' mused Poile, ``but you take
John Vanbiesbrouck out of the equation and would they have had that
kind of early success? His impact was huge.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps ironically, Vanbiesbrouck is one of the netminders Poile
can place on his roster. Unable to come to contract terms with
their fan favorite, the Panthers have left the 35-year-old
Vanbiesbrouck exposed in the draft. But Vanbiesbrouck comes with a
few caveats: his age, his asking price ($5 million a year or
better), and the fact that he becomes an unrestricted free agent
Wednesday. Given the last condition, the Predators could draft him
only to see their golden goalie solution turn to fool's gold in
less than a week.
</P>
<P>
   High-scoring winger Brett Hull and goalies Curtis Joseph and
Mike Richter are three more of the UFAs available to the Predators.
It's not likely, however, that the Predators will bite. Marquee
players cost a lot of money _ many established clubs are loath to
reach into their pockets for more than one, if that many _ and a
name up in lights doesn't always equate to points in the win
column. There are few slam dunks on the frozen pond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's the direction we're going in,'' said
Poile, asked specifically about his interest in Hull, who is
rumored to be headed from St. Louis to Chicago when July 1 arrives.
``I think I have too much respect for the game being a team game,
believing that one player rarely is going to mean the difference to
a club. As the years go by, we'd like to be able to say we were
better the second year than the first, even better the third year.
We know there's no quick fix here.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Picking through leftovers
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like all the NHL expansion teams before them, the Predators must
sort through a pile of has-beens and castaways in hopes of slapping
together a club that will be, at the very least, entertaining. Had
the likes of Messrs. Ranford, Wreggett, et al been available, the
chances of doing just that would have been much greater. Instead,
about the best the Predators can do is grab a polished role player
like the Red Wings' Doug Brown, now owner of two Stanley Cup rings,
and hope to get lucky with some younger players who might have been
underused elsewhere and suddenly thrive once they get loads of ice
time thrust upon them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the situation's right, we might be able to hit on one or
two; that's what you hope,'' said Poile. ``Look at the way (Brian)
Skrudland played when he got to Florida _ better than anywhere he'd
played before. And they picked up a couple of guys like Paul Laus
(from Pittsburgh) and Bill Lindsay (from Quebec), minor leaguers
who, once given the chance, really blossomed.''
</P>
<P>
   For the expansion fee of $75 million, these are slim pickings.
But it has always been that way. The NHL's Lords of the Boards are
always happy to collect the expansion cash, but they're deathly
afraid to part with personnel to make the new kid on the block
anything more than a skating version of the Washington Generals.
The expansion formula is a cash-but-no-carry business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the czar of expansions,'' chuckled Bill Torrey, who
oversaw the Islanders' entry in 1972 and then the Panthers' arrival
in 1993. ``Let's put that another way: I'm the survivor of
expansion.''
</P>
<P>
   Torrey's Islander team debuted a moribund 12-60-6, the worst
opening in league history. The Panthers were a far more respectable
33-34-17, the best in league history, thanks in large part to
goalies of Vanbiesbrouck's ilk being made available on expansion
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``No two expansion drafts are entirely alike,'' said Torrey, an
NHL Hall of Famer in the builders category. ``In my personal
experience, it changed dramatically, as well it should have when
you're talking about an expansion price that went from $2 million
to $50 million. At that price, you'd better get something better
than a ribbon around the package.''

   WASHINGTON _ Gasoline tanker-truck accidents usually kill only a
few people at a time, but they can be among the best remembered and
disruptive highway accidents because they can close roads for
months. The reason, according to the National Transportation Safety
Board, is bad design.
</P>
<P>
   But the Transportation Department, which regulates tanker
trucks, is resisting any change, because of tax laws.
</P>
<P>
   The tanks on gasoline tanker trucks are pretty tough, but their
loading lines, the pipes through which they are filled and emptied,
are not, and they are at just the height to be struck by
automobiles, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   The board issued a report last month on an accident in Yonkers,
N.Y., in October 1997 in which a sedan ran a red light and hit a
tank truck under an overpass of the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway.
The car driver was killed, and the ensuing fire necessitated $7
million in repairs to the overpass, which had to be closed for six
months. ``The significant element of this crash is not its cause as
much as its severity,'' the transportation safety board said.
</P>
<P>
   The overpass was partly melted when the thousands of gallons of
gasoline in the tank burned, but that gasoline would probably not
have ignited, experts say, but for the approximately 28 gallons in
the loading lines, which ruptured and poured into the car's hot
engine compartment.
</P>
<P>
   The board lined up 12 different passenger-car models near the
loading pipes of a tank truck and found that all of them were at
the right height to hit the lines.
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Department's Research and Special Programs
Administration, which is in charge of hazardous materials, proposed
more protection of those lines in 1985. But when the rule took
effect in 1990, an exception was made for petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
   One possible solution mentioned by the board would be to drain
the gasoline from the lines and pump it back into the tank.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with this plan, however, said William Vincent,
director of policy at the hazardous-materials office, is that
states tax the gasoline as it leaves the tank and enters the pipes,
and if that gasoline were put back into the tanks, it would be
taxed twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to figure out what to do to respond,'' he said.

<P>
   The Asphalt Rumble
</P>
<P>
   As highways are being rebuilt or repaved around the United
States, engineers have been adding ``rumble strips'' to the
shoulders. These bands of asphalt are grooved in a continuous
pattern that sends a mild jolt of vibration to a driver who drifts
out of the roadway. The goal is to reduce the number of accidents
involving drivers who fall asleep at the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure how effective this is, partly because it is hard
to tell how many accidents are caused by people falling asleep at
the wheel. From 10 percent to 24 percent of crashes are estimated
to involve fatigue or inattention of some kind, but these numbers
are based on guesswork.
</P>
<P>
   Some drivers do not live to talk about why they crashed, and
others survive but do not admit what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have estimates, but there's an awful lot of guessing,''
said Dr. Richard Pain, a research coordinator at the Transportation
Research Board, a federally financed agency that's part of the
National Research Council.
</P>
<P>
   At an accident scene, Pain said, ``It's extraordinarily
difficult for an officer to determine, unless someone says, `I was
asleep at the wheel.'''
</P>
<P>
   The New York State Thruway Authority, which is served by a
single police agency (State Police Troop T) and thus can gather
statistics well, has published what safety experts say are the most
authoritative figures so far. They show that rumble strips have
reduced by two-thirds the accidents believed to have been caused by
drivers' falling asleep, and have produced a fatality reduction of
three-quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The 641-mile New York State Thruway system finished installing
grooves in 1996; in the previous five years, it averaged 12
sleeping-driver fatalities a year, and in 1996 and 1997, three
fatalities a year.
</P>
<P>
   (The experiment is not pure, however, because Troop T has also
been conducting a campaign to reduce drunken driving and increase
seat-belt use, both of which would also reduce the number of fatal
vehicle accidents.)
</P>
<P>
   Shoulder grooves work best on long, straight sections, engineers
say. Many people are killed in accidents when a car leaves a curve
on a country road, but grooves usually will not help in that
situation, engineers say, because the reason for those accidents is
not driver inattention but excessive speed.
</P>
<P>
   At the American Association of State Highway Transportation
Officials, which recently endorsed the use of rumble strips, David
Hensing, the deputy executive director, said the strips were very
cheap to install during repaving and could often be done by running
a wheel made of steel rods over softened asphalt.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hold their ability to resonate for quite some period of
time,'' he said. Pain of the Transportation Research Board said
they cost as little as 25 cents a foot when installed during
repaving.

   TAKE-BOS  
 BUFFALO, N.Y.: ... the package.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Torrey's Islanders went on to capture the Stanley Cup in 1980,
less than eight years after opening for business in Uniondale. The
key to quick success wasn't the expansion draft, however. Hardly.
The Islanders' four consecutive Cups were rooted in some shrewd
picks in the amateur draft, including the likes of Denis Potvin
(No. 1 in '73), Clark Gillies (4/'74), Bryan Trotter (22/'74), and
Mike Bossy (15/'77). The expansion draft brought the Islanders
Eddie Westfall, a valuable role player from the Bruins, and unknown
netminder Billy Smith (from Los Angeles), who blossomed into a
franchise goalie, but it otherwise was a field full of more turnips
than dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got my list, I got sick,'' recalled Torrey, thinking
back to the the players made available in '72. ``Here I am in the
New York market, with the Rangers and Canadiens running 1-2 in the
league. The Rangers have got guys like (Rod) Gilbert, (Vic)
Hadfield, (Eddie) Giacomin, the Cat (Emile Francis). I'm thinking,
`Look at this!' I sure can tell you I didn't turn to my scouts and
say, `Whoopee, guys, we're gonna have some fun now.' You didn't
have to be Einstein to figure out we were in trouble.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
No helping hands
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   History has it that Wren Blair, then the GM in Minnesota,
stopped by the Flames' table in '72, the same day the Islanders
were picking, and congratulated Atlanta GM Cliff Fletcher on his
picks. The Flames finally had their faces, most of them highly
forgettable, such as Bobby Leiter (via Pittsburgh), Ernie Hicke
(California), and Larry Romanchych (Chicago). A gracious Fletcher
thanked Blair and asked if the North Stars' boss really liked his
picks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' Blair reportedly told Fletcher, ``and as soon as you
get rid of those bums, you'll have yourself a good club.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair spoke from experience. He was GM in Minnesota when the
North Stars entered the league in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Torrey recalled a similar incident in 1970 when George ``Punch''
Imlach was the GM making the picks for the expansion Buffalo
Sabres. Like Poile today, Imlach had to select a player from every
NHL roster. Imlach's last pick, recalled Torrey, was off the roster
of the Maple Leafs, a club that didn't make the playoffs in
1969-70.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Campbell was running the draft that day,'' said Torrey,
referring to Clarence Campbell, the late league president. ``And
I'll never forget him saying, `Mr. Imlach, you have to pick from
Toronto.' After this long pause, you hear Punch say, `Do I have to?
... Pass!' A couple of years later, when it was my turn on the
Island, I remember going up to Punch and saying, `Hey, Punch, can I
pass? You didn't leave me much.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruins Hall of Famer Milt Schmidt was the GM in Washington when
the Caps entered the league in 1974. There were very few diamonds
in the rough that year, too. Washington entered the league the same
year as Kansas City, and when Schmidt saw what both clubs were
being offered, he knew the two upstarts were in for some long
nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a very nice experience, to be honest,'' said
Schmidt, whose roster was dotted by unknowns such as Denis Dupere
(via Toronto), Ron Lalonde (via Pittsburgh), and Michel Belhumeur
(via Philadelphia). ``All expansion clubs think they'll be well
looked after, but the truth is, the other clubs just let you be,
without very much help. Unless you get very, very lucky, why, you'd
better make up your mind you're going to suffer for the first few
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the start-up problems for Washington and Kansas
City, said Schmidt, was a reversal in league policy that allowed
clubs to demote players to the minors without first exposing them
to waivers. Originally, he said, the league's governors planned to
make such players available to the expansion clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``KC and ourselves were supposed to get first whack,'' said
Schmidt. ``But the last couple of days before the draft, all the
GMs went to Mr. Campbell and the ruling was changed. I talked to
Sid (Abel), the (Kansas City) GM, and I said, `Sid, there's no way
we can stand for this. We just can't let it happen.' But when it
came time to vote, there's Sid saying, `For!' Heck, I was the only
one against it. That was a bad situation. Most of the good players
were protected in the entry draft, and then that just made it all
the worse.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the few positive notes, said Schmidt, could be found in
net, where the Caps were able to place Ron Low (now the Oilers'
coach) after prying him away from the Maple Leafs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were set there,'' said Schmidt. ``He was a pretty good
goalie. But for the most part, we got a couple of players with NHL
experience and then a bunch of college and minor league players.
Obviously, our record shows we weren't very good. Grin and bear it
_ it's all you could do.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Making do
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Former Flyer center Mel Bridgman, now an IMG agent, was at the
controls as GM when the Ottawa Senators entered the league in '92.
What was true for Torrey and Schmidt in the '70s was still in play
when Ottawa came marching back into the league as an expansion club
after a decades-long absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You realize you aren't going to get the elite players,'' said
Bridgman. ``Every player in the NHL is somewhat skilled and
talented, but the very best just aren't going to be available. Our
expectations in Ottawa were to draft and build a team with good
character, so when we made our first pick in the amateur draft,
Alexei Yashin, we had guys like Brad Marsh and Laurie Boschman in
place who could show them the right work ethic. Some of that is
probably paying off to this day.''
</P>
<P>
   Long before the sun sets, the NHL officially will be a 27-team
league. Atlanta, Columbus, and Minneapolis-St. Paul are soon to
follow. By the year 2,000, what was once the Original Six will have
grown fivefold. Chances are the expansion drafts to follow will
have an original, olde-tyme look: unrecognizable names and
questionable talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't control the hand we are dealt,'' said Poile,
referring to the talent pool at large that has been made available
to him. ``But I have a philosophy of what kind of team I want, and
we'll develop a philosophy as time goes. The reality is, we aren't
going to be as high on skill as other teams, but with a good
goalie, the right work ethic, I think we'll be OK.''

CLINTON TO VIEW EXPERIMENT IN DEMOCRACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   XIAHE, Shaanxi Province, China _ In this thriving village of 400
people that President Clinton visits Friday in midwestern China, a
quiet experiment in democracy is under way that could eventually
reshape the body politic of the world's last major communist state.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment is village elections, and over the last decade it
has been implemented gradually with varying degrees of success
across China's 930,000 rural hamlets, home to three-quarters of the
country's 1.2 billion people.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Xiahe (pronounced SHEAH-huh), a wealthier-than-average
village with paved roads, a couple of satellite dishes,
electricity, and an elected mayor, Clinton will see the best of
economic and political progress in rural China. But beneath the
showcasing, lies a deeper truth. Even if residents do not have a
keen understanding of democracy as Americans think of it, they do
know it makes a difference to choose their own leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is getting better for us, because the ordinary farmer has
the right to check on our village heads now, like how they spend
village funds,'' Yang Gongqian, a 32-year-old craftsman, said
Thursday over tea with a reporter at the spacious, two-story brick
home he shares with his extended family of six. ``Before, it was''
the village chief's ``right to decide what to do. Now, he has to
think of the village people; we are happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The system is far from flawless, and central government
officials estimate as many as half of villages are not conducting
elections ``up to standard.'' In some places, ballots are not
secret, the father votes for the whole family, or only one
candidate runs. In some communities, the Communist Party secretary
still dictates to elected village leaders, or tries to sabotage
elections to maintain his privileges.
</P>
<P>
   But in many places, according to US observer delegations,
villagers are learning the tremendous power of the vote: the
ability to turn out bad leaders and keep new ones honest and
hard-working.
</P>
<P>
   The larger question for the future of China is whether
grassroots democracy, however imperfect, will become a model for
direct elections and meaningful representation at higher levels of
government _ or whether it will remain confined to peasants who
wield no influence on national affairs and pose little threat to
Communist Party leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a vast country with no history and experience of free
elections. The question is where do you choose to start?'' said
Robert Pastor, director of the China project at the Atlanta-based
Carter Center. Pastor is in China this month introducing a pilot
data collection system to determine if voting is fair and to help
the government standardize procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many things we take for granted, like a secret ballot, are
quite alien here,'' Pastor said. ``It's not easy to implement
democracy in China, which is why it makes sense to start in
villages. You start in a place where people are less likely to
understand it, but where three-fourths of the people live.''
</P>
<P>
   For thousands of years, village elders or feudal lords ruled
over rural areas, and after the 1949 communist victory, chiefs were
appointed by party officials. In the last 10 years, 600 million
voters have elected four million officials in 24 provinces and
autonomous regions, according to officials. Village committees are
elected for three-year terms to administer basic services like
education, irrigation, road-building, and family planning.
</P>
<P>
   In his visits to several provinces, Pastor has seen
irregularities that he believes stem more often from
misunderstanding than malfeaseance. He has observed voters looking
over each other's shoulders, ballots taken home, and votes counted
in secret. But he also watched scrupulous balloting; heard
candidates pledge to post accounts and stop spending taxpayer money
on party officials, and saw non-party members defeat incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   Xiahe villagers give contradictory explanations of how their
process works. One 28-year-old woman said everyone votes until 10
people are chosen, then everyone votes again for five committee
members. A 32-year-old man said villagers split into groups of 10
that each select a person, and those delegates vote for leaders. A
group of villagers said the government gives them a candidate list
and tells them to vote from that list.
</P>
<P>
   What was consistent was that villagers seemed happy with their
mayor, and even more with their power to make suggestions to
officials and to reelect or kick them out. One man said villagers
persuaded leaders to build an underground irrigation system to save
water lost to evaporation. Elections make a difference ``if we get
someone we trust,'' said Yang Shuiyan, 75, a retired teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be cynical and say the whole purpose is to stabilize
the system and keep the Communist Party in power, but stability is
absolutely critical for economic development,'' said David Zweig, a
China scholar at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.
``If it's a more open system and people are more able to influence
outcomes, that's an important first step to establishing
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The obvious question is what the next step will be, and why
after a decade, voting has not trickled up even to townships, much
less to the national level. The urban equivalent of grassroots
voting is for neighborhood committees, but they have do not control
funds or set important policies.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews in Beijing this week, many residents said they had
never voted for any leader and never heard of village elections.
``Rural elections don't matter,'' scoffed Ma Wenting, 26, a
joint-venture company employee. ``The central government election _
now that would be important.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, the late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping suggested
village elections were part of a 50-year process that would
eventually lead to national elections. Three months ago, Premier
Zhu Rongji said he believed in direct national elections, but said
leaders needed time to consider the idea.
</P>
<P>
   There is no sign now that the Communist Party has any interest
in multi-party elections, nor is there any hint of a lessening of
the party's control. Yet the last year has seen openings on many
fronts, and discussions under way this week to amend the election
law to ensure fairness are significant.
</P>
<P>
   Liu Yawei, a history professor at DeKalb College, in DeKalb,
Ill., &UR;  &LR; and member of the Carter Center team, likens China to ``a
big kaleidoscope. It seems to be out of focus and so many things
are happening. We have talked to scholars who say that after''
Chinese President ``Jiang Zemin's trip to the US, they were
commanded to study and write about the presidential system, Western
capitalist democracy, how to expand village elections.''

   ``In the next 10 years or even sooner,'' Liu predicted,
``everything will come into focus, and the end result will be a
more democratic China.''
</P>
<P>
   But Xu Liugen, a director-general at the Ministry of Civil
Affairs, which is in charge of village elections, cautioned that
``very often Westerners, outsiders, judge China's practice from
their own experience. This is Chinese democracy at the grassroots
level, with Chinese characteristics. Outsiders can give your
comments, but we have to do things our way.''

 COMPROMISE IN DISPUTE OVER CHINESE OPERA PRODUCTION
</HEADLINE>
 (bl)  
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ At precisely the same time that President
Clinton arrived to a colorfully choreographed welcoming ceremony in
Xian on Thursday evening, a remarkable drama about a different
strand of U.S.-Chinese relations was wrapping up at Shanghai
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   In a seedy-looking departure lounge, Nigel Redden, director of
New York's Lincoln Center Festival, sat down for a final talk with
Shanghai Culture Bureau Director Ma Bomin, who has been blocking
the classic Chinese opera ``The Peony Pavilion'' from arriving in
New York in time for its scheduled opening July 7.
</P>
<P>
   Redden's flight was scheduled for 7:40 p.m., and he was informed
in the late afternoon that Ms. Ma would go to the airport to see
him off, because she had something to say.
</P>
<P>
   At 7 p.m. in the bar, Ms. Ma informed Redden that her bureau was
now willing to compromise on the matter that kicked off this whole
drama a week ago: blocking the shipment of elaborate sets, costumes
and props. The shipment, Ms. Ma said, could now proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Redden, suspicious after days of fruitless negotiations, quickly
asked a pertinent question: What about the actors? Would they be
allowed to go too ?
</P>
<P>
   No, Ms. Ma said with a grimace, the actors of the Kunqu Opera
Company would not yet be allowed to perform, as she had said over
and over, unless the opera was fully restaged to fit government
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Costumes, but no actors. Perfect. So a high-profile example of
cultural exchange between the United States and China lay in ruins,
on the day President Clinton arrived for a state visit, precisely
the time when Chinese and United States officials are most eager to
clear away unnecessary public conflict.
</P>
<P>
   To an arts executive like Redden, it is stunning that Chinese
authorities would want to prevent any ancient Chinese opera from
being performed in New York (especially since Lincoln Center is
paying). But it became clear in recent days that Chinese
officialdom was not against ``The Peony Pavilion,'' so much as one
particular official was, and her name is Ma.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ma's comments suggest that some petty political motives _
power over artistic troupes, professional jealousy, the right to
censor _ may play as big a role as the artistic objections she
cited, complaining that the work was a national treasure that
needed to be protected from unorthodox interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   And the reluctance of any higher Chinese authority to rein her
in suggests that she wields considerable political clout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep asking about it, and the reaction is always `It's
extremely complicated,' '' said Raymond Burghardt, U.S. consul
general in Shanghai. ``Well, why is it so complicated?'' Burghardt
was asking the question rhetorically, since as a diplomat with long
experience in China he knows that calling a matter ``extremely
complicated'' is a polite way of saying that there are a lot of
politics involved.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Burghardt fudged when asked whether President Clinton would
inquire about the opera, even though one polite question from
Clinton, voiced to a Chinese leader, could conceivably solve the
issue in an instant.
</P>
<P>
   At the airport Thursday evening, Redden began to let his
frustration show after making so little headway in negotiations,
particularly when Ms. Ma, a former opera singer, tried to tell
reporters who had been hastily assembled that her compromise showed
how her bureau had been so flexible in these talks
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no flexibility at all,'' Redden protested.
``I've been here since Monday, and have been met with no
cooperation whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   As her aides started insisting that Redden leave because his
flight was boarding, Ms. Ma turned to the reporters again to say,
in Chinese, that perhaps both sides should continue to keep
talking, since there were more avenues to be pursued.
</P>
<P>
   When the comment was translated to Redden, he apparently thought
Ms. Ma had actually meant what she said. He immediately ripped up
his boarding pass and said, ``So let's talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking shocked, as though a major headache on the verge of
flying away had now decided to stick around, Ms. Ma again described
her concern about the opera's script, and how it would be necessary
to unpack the costumes to rehearse. So maybe, she said, that
shipment should not actually be allowed to go to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, Redden was presented with a new boarding pass. It
was clear that Ms. Ma had no real interest in negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   After Redden left, Ms. Ma turned to the reporters again and made
another pitch: maybe Lincoln Center would accept a safer version of
``The Peony Pavilion,'' one that was simpler to stage, that used
none of the innovative techniques of Chen Shi-Zheng, the director
hired by Lincoln Center, whom Ms. Ma, to put it mildly, does not
like.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have already started rehearsing,'' Ms. Ma said,
brightening. ``We could certainly take it to Lincoln Center in time
for their festival.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen, dejected by the opera's demise, lamented that bureaucrats
like Ms. Ma seemed to have no sense that a serious arts festival
like Lincoln Center's actually valued artistic integrity and
vision, and would not simply slap in a replacement performance by
another troupe if the original was blocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, `The Peony Pavilion' itself is about pursuing a
dream, and how you need it to survive,'' said Chen, who left China
in 1987 and became an American citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Musing about his own dream of staging the opera in its original
and full 55-act, 20-hour form, he said, ``In China today, it is so
clear, that kind of spirit is not allowed to live.''

ANTIUNITY BOMB RAISES CYNICISM IN IRISH TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWTOWNHAMILTON, Northern Ireland _ Less than 24 hours after a
bomb damaged her fish 'n chips shop, Andrea Clark sat in the corner
of the Horseshoe Bar Thursday, having a lunch that consisted of a
Snickers bar and a bottle of Harp lager.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's election of a Northern Ireland Assembly was hailed as
the dawn of a new era. But from Andrea Clark's vantage point,
looking across the street at the boarded up windows of her shop, it
looked very much like the old Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you call this a peace process?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Her shop didn't get the worst of it. Less than 100 yards down
the street, the roofs of shops and homes had been torn off by a
bomb left in a car outside a police station by a group of Irish
republican dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish National Liberation Army, a small paramilitary group
that is more radical than the IRA, claimed responsibility for the
midafternoon explosion, which left a 15-year-old boy hospitalized
and dozens of schoolchildren traumatized.
</P>
<P>
   Coming on the eve of Thursday's election, the results of which
are not expected until Friday, the bombing was seen by many as a
cynical exercise by those who see Northern Ireland moving forward
without them.
</P>
<P>
   One could forgive Clark for being cynical. In the past eight
years, her shop here has been damaged twice by bombs, as has her
home in nearby Markethill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still haven't fixed my house from the last one,'' she said,
referring to a bomb last September that was the work of republican
dissidents trying to disrupt the resumption of the negotiations
that led to the Good Friday agreement in which most political
parties agreed to share power.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Clark voted against the agreement in last month's referendum,
which was approved by 71 percent of voters in Northern Ireland. The
bombing persuaded her to vote Thursday for candidates who oppose
the agreement and who have vowed to wreck the Assembly. She was
defensive when asked if she was reacting exactly as the bombers
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'm more cynical than anyone else in Northern
Ireland,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Newtownhamilton is a town of about 1,800, of which 60 percent
are Catholic and 40 percent are Protestant. People say relations
between the two communities are good, and don't expect the bombing
to change that.
</P>
<P>
   Locals say there have been at least five big bombs over the
years. Voting Thursday was supposed to take place in the community
center, but it was badly damaged by the blast and polls were moved
to the high school on the outskirts of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before it was a community center, it was a courthouse, and
they bombed that, too,'' said Carl Warmington, 75, a local
veterinarian.
</P>
<P>
   Warmington, a Protestant unionist who wants Northern Ireland to
remain part of Britain, believes the bomb was sanctioned by the
IRA, despite its cease-fire. Standing outside the high school after
voting, he pointed accusingly at a campaign poster that showed the
Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, whose party is close to the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family's been here for 300 years, and we're not leaving,''
said Warmington, who thinks the peace process is a naive attempt to
appease terrorists who reserve the option of using violence
whenever it suits them.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a trailer across from the polls, Sinn Fein supporter
Pat Hughes said it was ludicrous to suggest mainstream republicans
had anything to do with the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that does is hurt Sinn Fein,'' said Hughes. ``A good
strong vote for Sinn Fein would cut out the likes of these
things.''

HEARING IN CALIFORNIA `LEMON LAW' CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (bl)  
 By ANDREA ADELSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some two years after California tried to penalize Chrysler for
what the state said were violations of its tough ``lemon law,'' a
court is considering a move Friday to reverse a ruling that threw
out the findings and sanctions against the automaker.
</P>
<P>
   The suit in California Superior Court by the state Department of
Motor Vehicles, which initiated the action against Chrysler Corp.,
is the first civil court hearing of a case in which a major auto
manufacturer has been accused of reselling defective vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Other states have settled accusations against automakers for
similar violations, but none have had to file suit to impose
sanctions, said Bill Gengler, a spokesman for the motor vehicles
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, the little-known California New Motor Vehicle
Board, which was created to settle disputes between auto dealers
and manufacturers, overturned the motor vehicles agency's action,
the harshest so far by any state for violations of lemon laws. The
penalty would have halted shipment of Chrysler cars and trucks to
the state for 45 days.
</P>
<P>
   In papers submitted to the court, the lawyers for the Department
of Motor Vehicles said Chrysler had taken back 116 defective cars
that were subsequently offered for resale without the required
disclosures, warranties and repairs. In addition, the department
cited 20 separate instances in which consumers bought lemons
without receiving the disclosure information required under the
California law.
</P>
<P>
   Besides ruling that Chrysler had complied with state laws, the
new vehicle panel also found that the state agency had wrongfully
withheld evidence. Among the documents was a memo written to the
agency's director a year after the accusations against Chrysler
were filed, which asked for clarification of the lemon law's
provisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had that document before we went to trial, we could show
that the DMV didn't even know the basis of the law they were suing
us under,'' said Lewis Goldfarb, Chrysler's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The company maintained that its resale practices complied with
state laws.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, the motor vehicles agency argued that the
reversal by the new vehicle board was unjustified and gave improper
weight to the potential economic consequences of the penalty to
dealers over protection for consumers.

A FRUSTRATING ATTEMPT AT `THE OPPOSITE OF SEX'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes, you wish first-time filmmakers wouldn't try so hard.
Case in point: ``The Opposite of Sex,'' which announces its
self-consciousness from the first few frames, when Christina
Ricci's voice comes on the soundtrack and tells us that she's the
narrator, and if you don't like movies with narrators, tough.
</P>
<P>
   Just what you want: a film that starts off with an apology. And
make no mistake, despite Ricci's snide tone, the film itself is
apologizing for its narration.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing wrong with narration, as long as the tone and flow are
consistent. But Ricci's character, Dedee, lectures us from time to
time and keeps reminding us that we're watching a movie, even doing
us the service of pointing out the cliches. Kinda hard to get lost
in a movie when she does stuff like this.
</P>
<P>
   Dedee's words and actions are the creations of Don Roos, a
veteran screenwriter (''Single White Female,'' ``Boys on the
Side'') taking his first turn behind the camera. Roos has concocted
an ambitious, outrageous and perceptive script with some
laugh-out-loud moments _ although those often come from cheap shots
at easy targets. But as a director, he keeps undercutting himself,
forcing his points or emphasizing them as if he didn't have enough
confidence in his words.
</P>
<P>
   And often, they're deliciously vicious words. Dedee's a truly
nasty character: After her stepfather dies, she migrates from
Louisiana to Indiana, where she drops in on her brother Bill
(Martin Donovan), a gay schoolteacher. Faster than you can say
``switch-hit,'' she seduces Bill's boyfriend Matt (Ivan Sergei) and
convinces him that they should get married because she's pregnant.
They run off to California with some of Bill's money and the ashes
of Bill's deceased lover.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, there's still more _ as Dedee says, things get very
complicated very quickly. Jason, an old flame of Matt's (Johnny
Galecki) accuses Bill of molesting him, prompting Bill and his dead
lover's sister Lucia (Lisa Kudrow) to chase down Matt so that he
can clear Bill's name. Told you it was complicated, and that's not
even counting Lyle Lovett as a good-hearted sheriff or William
Scott Lee as a fundamentalist sort who also has an interest in
Dedee.
</P>
<P>
   Roos isn't interested in teaching tolerance here, but you may
have to practice tolerance anyway just to be able to stomach some
of the characters. Galecki gets on your nerves enough that you're
likely to wish it was real when Bill does a number on one of
Jason's many piercings, and the versatile Kudrow is just too
strident as the spinsterish sister.
</P>
<P>
   Roos shows promise as a director, especially in the one-on-one
scenes. But he makes a lot of rookie errors, most specifically in
trying too hard to involve the audience in what should already be
an involving story. Like Dedee in the movie, Roos the writer might
have been wise to let his child be nurtured by more experienced
hands.

U.S. OFFICIALS EXPRESS CONCERN OVER DETENTION OF DISSIDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: CHINA-SCENE, CHINA-CLINTON, HINA-PEONY) 
(th) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ U.S. officials expressed concern to the Chinese
government Thursday over reports that several dissidents had been
detained and others harassed in relation to President Clinton's
state visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very concerned that some dissidents may have been
detained or otherwise disrupted,'' White House spokesman Mike
McCurry told reporters soon after Clinton's arrival in Xian on
Thursday evening. He said that U.S. Ambassador James Sasser had
conveyed this to Chinese officials.
</P>
<P>
   In the Xian area, three democracy advocates were reportedly
detained and a fourth was forced to temporarily leave the area.
</P>
<P>
   Yang Hai of Xian, one of about 70 people around the country who
had signed an open letter calling on Clinton to meet with
dissidents during his visit, was taken away by police Thursday,
according to the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic
Movement in China, a Hong Kong-based monitoring group.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Yan Jun, also of Xian and another signer of that
letter, and Li Zhiying, who lives in a nearby town and has signed
various petitions to the government, were detained as well, the
center said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another Xian resident who had signed the open letter to
Clinton, Fu Sheng, was put on a train to Qingdao on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Security forces in China often use temporary detentions as a way
to intimidate dissidents and prevent their activities at sensitive
times, such as Clinton's visit. In addition, more than 2,000 people
are believed to be in labor camps or prison for longer terms for
their pro-democracy activities.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the months since the Chinese government released the
prominent dissident Wei Jingsheng into exile in the United States
last November, after President Jiang Zemin's state visit to the
United States, scores of people around the country have been
signing petitions and writing open letters calling for democracy
and a reappraisal of the military crackdown in Tiananmen Square in
1989, in which hundreds of civilians were killed. Many of them face
constant police harassment.
</P>
<P>
   In the eastern city of Hangzhou on Thursday, three democracy
campaigners applied to register a new political party, the Chinese
Democratic Party, and one of them was later detained, his wife told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party has a total monopoly on power and allows a
few token parties to operate only under its guidance. In an unusual
and risky move, Wang Youcai, Wang Donghai and Lin Hui left
application papers for their opposition party with a Zhejiang
provincial office.
</P>
<P>
   Wang Donghai, 53, was arrested Thursday evening, his wife, Cheng
Yunhui, told the Reuters news agency.
</P>
<P>
   The best known of the three, Wang Youcai, 31, was a student
leader in the 1989 demonstrations that ended in the Tiananmen
massacre. He was sentenced to four years but released early for
good conduct in November 1991. This spring, he was detained when he
tried to attend centennial celebrations at Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday afternoon, after applying to form the new party, Wang
told reporters, ``We hope Clinton will pay attention and support
the establishment of an opposition party in China, so we chose
today to register.''
</P>
<P>
   A separate group led by Wang Bingzhang, who lives in exile in
the United States, says it has established a small underground
opposition party in China called the China Democracy and Justice
Party.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing on Thursday, one of the most outspoken democracy
advocates, Xu Wenli, said he is conspicuously followed by agents
when he leaves his home and that four friends who tried to visit
him were briefly detained and questioned. &QL;

FAGAN ARRAIGNED ON KIDNAPPING CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM F. DOHERTY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ With both his daughters by his side, Stephen
H. Fagan returned to Massachusetts from Palm Beach, Fla., Thursday
and pleaded not guilty to charges that he kidnapped his children
from his ex-wife 19 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   After entering his plea during a brief arraignment in Middlesex
Superior Court Thursday, Fagan was released on the same $250,000
bail set shortly after his arrest in April.
</P>
<P>
   But Judge Joseph A. Grasso Jr., acting on a request by Middlesex
prosecutor Lynn C. Rooney, also set additional secret conditions on
Fagan's release.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Rooney nor defense attorney Richard M. Egbert would
comment on the new bail conditions, which were immediately sealed
by the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan, 56, is charged with two counts of kidnapping and one
count of contempt of a probate court order that had prohibited him
from taking the children out of state in 1979. Grasso scheduled a
pretrial conference July 21.
</P>
<P>
   A former Framingham resident, Fagan allegedly kidnapped his
daughters, then ages 2 and 5, after a bitter custody fight with
Barbara Kurth, his ex-wife. Fagan took the children during a
weekend visit, traveled to Florida, told them their mother had died
in a car crash, and assumed a new identity.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kurth hired several private investigators but could
not find him or her daughters.
</P>
<P>
   In newspaper and television interviews, Fagan has never denied
taking his daughters, but insisted he did so because their lives
were in danger from their mother's alcoholism and neglect.
</P>
<P>
   Kurth, a research scientist at the University of Virginia, has
denied she was neglectful and had a drinking problem.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Fagan nor his daughters spoke to reporters Thursday.
After the arraignment, Egbert urged the media to leave the family
alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are very difficult times. Their support for each other
is unwavering. It is particularly important that they go on with
their family life,'' Egbert said.
</P>
<P>
   In an outline of the case filed in court Thursday, Rooney said
that when Fagan and his children came to Florida in 1979, they
stayed at the home of Carolyn Garrison, an acquaintance of Fagan's
from his days as a doorman at the Kenmore Club in Kenmore Square.
</P>
<P>
   Garrison said the girls were ``shellshocked'' when they arrived,
according to the prosecution summary. Fagan told Garrison that
police had found his ex-wife's car at the side of the road and they
believed she was dead.
</P>
<P>
   The summary said that after arriving in Florida, Fagan told the
younger child, Wendy, then 2, that he would be calling her Lisa.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Wendy asked why, he simply said that it was her middle
name and that was what he intended to call her,'' the summary said.

`SIGHT' ONE OF SUMMER'S BEST MOVIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If crime novelist Elmore Leonard were to pick music to accompany
his books, he probably would make the same choice as director
Steven Soderbergh does in ``Out of Sight'': the stand-up funk of
the Isley Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   A tasty, down-low organ vamp from the greasy groove of ``It's
Your Thing'' opens the picture, one of the best movies to hit
multiplex screens this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Soderbergh and screenwriter Scott Frank flip the script in a
number of ways; this is the smartest adaptation of Leonard ever,
taking Leonard's fascination with recidivist behavior that unfolds
in anecdotal fashion and twisting it into a compelling, fractured
narrative. They give ``Out of Sight'' flow, and as a result the
movie's a scrumptious blend of humor and drama, with a hint of
maliciousness, for spice _ an adult jolt of caffeine that goes down
great when matched with the summer's other antic sugary junk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of Sight'' begins with George Clooney, who plays
compulsive bank robber Jack Foley, doing something he isn't often
given the chance to do _ show anger. Rage bursting out of him, he
stomps out of a downtown Florida office building and grapples with
his necktie, snatching it off his throat.
</P>
<P>
   By starting the picture like this, we see some actual feeling in
Clooney. He's not working the camera like some gigolo on a Carnival
Cruise, the way he often does on ``ER'' (It's genre pictures that
seem to make Clooney break through; he had a grim, reflexive
swiftness in the vampire-slaughter fest ``From Dusk Till Dawn.'')
</P>
<P>
   Foley makes a prison break just as federal marshal Karen Sisco
(Jennifer Lopez) shows up at Glades Correctional Facility to deal
with a convict complaint. Foley and his partner, Buddy (Ving
Rhames), grab her and take her along.
</P>
<P>
   One of the oddest pickup scenes in movie history, and one of
several that plays on the simmering rapport between Clooney and
Lopez, is his chatty, chivalrous attempt at courtship while the two
of them ride along, locked in the trunk of a car.
</P>
<P>
   From there, ``Out of Sight'' shifts into a caper film in
Detroit. Soderbergh sets an instant contrast with the sunny, pastel
amiability of Florida; Motown is all business, full of blacks,
grays and dark blues, a winter's night without a moon.
</P>
<P>
   It's there that a plan to hit a mansion (owned by the owlish
white-collar criminal Albert Brooks) brings Foley and Buddy
together with Snoopy (Don Cheadle) and his squad: his angry
brother-in-law (Isaiah Washington) and a loser side-of-beef named
White Boy Bob. Snoopy is the standard Satan in Leonard's fiction, a
thug who loves the rush of violence, but as played by the lithe,
talented Cheadle, it's just one more plus in his way of doing
business.
</P>
<P>
   Sisco's pursuit leads her there as well, wearing a
contour-fitting leather jacket from the Catwoman collection that
seems to have been chosen more for fashion than for
wind-chill-fighting comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard's writing technique doesn't exactly lend itself to the
movies, because his books don't rely on standard plot construction.
He couldn't be less interested in narrative momentum. He'd rather
use incidents to build character brick by brick. Leonard doesn't
write suspense novels or thrillers _ he writes crime novels, thick
with hoods alive with pleasure from a noseful of a good rip-off.
</P>
<P>
   It's Quentin Tarantino's slavish devotion to the tenor of
Leonard's material that crippled ``Jackie Brown;'' even when it's
good, it seems to be going nowhere, and in no particular hurry.
``Get Shorty,'' which Scott Frank also adapted, was staged like a
comic strip, with John Travolta doing a charismatic star turn right
in the center of the frame.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard's strengths happen to coincide with Soderbergh's. Both
are interested in tracking the flaws that lead people to follow the
impulses that cause them the most trouble, a pack of moths happily
hurling themselves into a campfire.
</P>
<P>
   It's the way that Soderbergh fills in the details that makes
``Out of Sight'' lively and smart. Each location in the movie acts
as another character; when the picture moves to Detroit, everything
feels right, from the use of the Kronk gym where manager Emmanuel
Stewart has tutored boxers from Tommy Hearns to Oscar de la Hoya,
to the red-pop finger-waves on Washington's head, a coiffure that's
hilariously ghetto.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of Sight'' meanders a little, but that's inescapable when
adapting Leonard. (However, there are some cameos that will delight
those who've seen other Leonard films.) The only problem is that it
may be a little mature and melancholy for the summer, generally a
time of year for movies that you can take in their entirety with
one eye closed.

FEDERAL DRUG ENFORCERS REPORT RISE IN USE OF METHAMPHETAMINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NICOLE TSONG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The rising popularity of methamphetamine in the
eastern United States indicates a growth in nationwide use of the
drug beyond its former domain in California, federal officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Barry McCaffrey, the Clinton administration's national drug
policy director, said methamphetamine was ``probably the worst drug
to hit America in 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey released a semi-annual report on illicit drug trends
that includes information collected from drug researchers, law
enforcement officials and substance-abuse treatment workers. It
shows the use of the methamphetamine spreading to Atlanta,
Baltimore, Boston and Columbia, Md., a suburb of Baltimore and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Methamphetamine, which is known by such street names as speed,
meth, and ice, is a brain stimulant that enhances mood and body
movement. It is taken in a variety of forms, including pills,
crystals that are smoked and powder that is snorted through the
nose.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alan Leshner, director of the National Institute on Drug
Abuse, told a news conference that methamphetamine was ``one of the
most dangerous drugs we have in front of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Side effects of using methamphetamine include irritability,
anxiety, paranoia and aggressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The violence associated with that drug includes spouse abuse,
child abuse and neglect and risks posed by methamphetamine users
and manufacturers to law enforcement officers and unsuspecting
citizens,'' said Donnie Marshall, deputy administrator of the Drug
Enforcement Administration.
</P>
<P>
   According to the federal government's 1996 National Household
Survey on Drug Abuse, 4.9 million people _ or 2.3 percent of the
population _ had tried methamphetamine at least once in their
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Methamphetamine abuse is widespread In California, the Office of
National Drug Control Policy said in the report.
</P>
<P>
   But the semi-annual report released Thursday contained no
specific figures on drug use or statistics on violence linked to
methamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   As a drug that is produced in illegal laboratories, and even in
the home, the cheap price and the rush that lasts longer than the
high from cocaine are two factors in the growing popularity of
methamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   In a poll taken by the National Institute of Justice in 1996, 45
percent of methamphetamine users reported paranoia, 62 percent
reported family problems and 44 percent experienced problems at
work.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the use of methamphetamine, an increase in the
use of heroin was reported in Atlanta, Miami, Newark, and San
Francisco, McCaffrey said. He attributed the increase to the
significant supply available on the world market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock has no value. Mexican and Colombian heroin, to
compete in the market, they're going to go higher purity, lower
cost,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in purity gives users more opportunities to snort
or smoke heroin instead of injecting it, which appeals to younger
users who fear intravenous injection, McCaffrey said.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor contributing to the rising use of heroin is that
criminal organizations push both cocaine and heroin, the government
said. The report shows that 75 percent of addicts in treatment for
heroin have problems with cocaine as well.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Thursday sidetracked
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's effort to obtain notes of a
conversation between White House aide Vincent Foster Jr. and his
lawyer shortly before Foster committed suicide in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In a 6-3 ruling, the court said the attorney-client privilege,
the principle that conversations people have with their lawyers are
confidential, does not end with the death of the client. It thus
blocked Starr's attempt to force James Hamilton, Foster's lawyer,
to turn over the notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been overwhelmingly, if not universally, accepted, for
well over a century, that the privilege survives the client's death
in a case such as this,'' Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote for
the court.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist said that eroding the attorney-client privilege could
make people reluctant to tell their lawyers the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing that communications will remain confidential even
after death serves a weighty interest in encouraging a client to
communicate fully and frankly with counsel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling represented a setback for Starr. The prosecutor has
said the notes could be important to his investigation into
allegations that White House aides or First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton lied under oath about her involvement in the firing of
seven career employees of the White House travel office in May
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Foster, a boyhood friend of President Clinton and a Little Rock
law partner of Mrs. Clinton, came to Washington in 1993 to join the
new administration as deputy White House counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Within months, Foster was embroiled in a controversy surrounding
the firings at the White House travel office.
</P>
<P>
   Republican critics have charged that Mrs. Clinton ordered the
firings to make room for friends of the Clintons. Mrs. Clinton has
said she had no role in the dismissals.
</P>
<P>
   But a memo of a former White House staffer, David Watkins,
turned over to prosecutors in 1996, said Foster had ``regularly
informed me'' of Mrs. Clinton's ``insistence'' that the travel
office employees be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   In personal notes written at the time, Foster worried that
administration officials would face a congressional inquiry and
possibly a criminal probe of the firings. He also expressed concern
that Mrs. Clinton's role would be misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   On July 11, Foster consulted Hamilton about what he should do.
During their two-hour meeting Hamilton took three pages of notes.
</P>
<P>
   Nine days later, worried about the travel office controversy,
charges about Whitewater land deals and the hostile political
atmosphere in Washington, Foster drove to Fort Marcy Park in nearby
Virginia and shot himself to death.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Starr, investigating the charges that Mrs.
Clinton had lied about her role in the travel office case,
subpoenaed Hamilton's notes.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in Washington rejected the subpoena, but in
August 1997 the U.S. Court of Appeals here overturned that
decision, ruling in favor of Starr.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday the Supreme Court decided the appeals court was
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, Anthony M.
Kennedy, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G.
Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas
dissented.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the three, O'Connor said that when no other sources
of evidence are available, a prosecutor's need to find the truth
overrides the late client's desire for confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my view, the cost of silence warrants a narrow exception to
the rule that the attorney-client privilege survives the death of a
client,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers' groups hailed the decision as a victory for privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's good for clients. It's important for the legal
profession; and I think it's good for the country that people will
have confidence in that what they tell their attorney will remain
in confidence,'' said Jerome Shestack, president of the American
Bar Association.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the setback, Starr showed no signs of ending his
travel-office probe. ``In all events, we continue to pursue our
investigation as thoroughly and expeditiously as possible,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A White House official accompanying the president in China
called the ruling ``an important validation of the vital issue of
attorney-client privilege.''
</P>
<P>
   Another attorney-client privilege case is pending in Starr's
investigation of whether Clinton had sex with former White House
aide Monica Lewinsky and lied about it. In that case, now before a
federal appeals court here, White House lawyer Bruce Lindsey is
trying to keep from disclosing his conversations with various
people in the Lewinsky probe.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the attorney-client privilege, courts have recognized
that a confidentiality privilege exists between people and their
spouses and their doctors and between priests and penitents.

CLINTON LANDS IN CHINA, WADES INTO HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   XIAN, China _ In a swirl of pageantry, controversy and hope,
President Clinton arrived at the gates to this ancient capital last
night to begin his nine-day journey through China, and immediately
delved into the sensitive issue of human rights with a gentle
rebuke of the country's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   As dusk gave way to dark, Clinton and his wife left their
limousine at the head of a 50-car motorcade and walked slowly down
a block-long red carpet toward the glowing wall of Xian, waving and
smiling at the hundreds of citizens who lined the way.
</P>
<P>
   In an elaborate emperor's welcome, dozens of men in warrior
costumes, bathed in the soft light of red lanterns, pounded on
massive drums with cloth-covered sticks. Strains of Tang Dynasty
music echoed off the 600-year-old city wall and carried over the
surrounding moat. Virgin flower girls knelt before Clinton in
formation as men marched with paper dragons nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, looking visibly worn from an 18-hour flight, greeted
the crowd with a few words of Chinese and launched directly into a
brief lecture on human rights -- in a likely harbinger of a
stronger message to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Respect for the worth, the dignity, the potential, and the
freedom of every citizen is a vital source of America's strength
and success,'' Clinton said to the silent audience. ``A commitment
to providing all human beings the opportunity to develop their full
potential is vital to the strength and success of the new China as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Clinton delivered his short speech, a fresh controversy
over human rights erupted around him. A Hong Kong-based human
rights group said the Chinese government had detained a pair of
well-known dissidents Thursday, one of whom, Yan Jun of Xian, had
signed a letter asking Clinton to meet with dissidents during the
visit.
</P>
<P>
   The actions appeared to alarm White House officials, who were
already sensitive to Republican criticism that Clinton was
overlooking human rights violations in his pursuit of an economic
engagement of China. Officials said United States ambassador James
R. Sasser would raise the issue with Chinese authorities today and
Clinton would implicitly touch on the dissidents with President
Jiang Zemin on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are aware of reports of dissidents being detained,'' said
P.J. Crowley, a White House spokesman. ``The president, in his
meetings with President Jiang, will encourage China to allow freer
political dialogue so that all Chinese citizens can be free to
express their political beliefs without government interference.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's arrival to this inland city of 6.5 million people was
designed by White House strategists to be heavy on ceremony and
light on the substance of his trip, a soft opening of sorts for his
nine-day, five city tour that ends July 3. Friday, Clinton will
extol the virtues of local democracy with a visit to a tiny village
which elected its mayor by popular vote. Friday afternoon, he plans
to tour the famed Terra Cotta Warriors, an army of some 6,000
lifesized clay statutes buried near the tomb of Emperor Qin
Shihuang, and discovered by a local farmer digging a well in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy awaits Clinton Friday night (EST) when he arrives in
the capital of Beijing for a formal welcoming ceremony at the Great
Hall of the People, just off Tiananmen Square. A group of
Republican lawmakers and some key human rights advocates have
sharply criticized Clinton for appearing on the square where
Chinese authorities killed hundreds and even thousands of
protesters in June 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, anxious over the sybolism of Clinton's
appearance, intentionally scheduled his arrival for a time of
minimal news exposure back home, and plans to have Clinton make
remarks to US reporters about human rights within a few hours of
his arrival.
</P>
<P>
   In a half-day of meetings between Jiang and Clinton Saturday,
the Chinese are expected to push the US to distance itself from
Taiwan, an island off the coast of China which the US does not
officially recognize but with which it maintains friendly ties.
Jiang is also expected to campaign for greater US support for
China's bid to enter the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Clinton is expected to push Jiang to play a greater,
more constructive role to defuse the nuclear arms buildup between
India and Pakistan. Clinton will also prod Chinese officials to
tear down trade barriers to US goods.
</P>
<P>
   Not since George Bush visited Beijing in the pre-Tiananmen
Square massacre days of February 1989 has an American president
stepped on Chinese soil. And not since Richard Nixon visited
Beijing -- then Peking -- in 1973 has a presidential trip generates
so much controversy in the corridors of power back home.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1992 reelection, Clinton accused Bush of ``coddling
dictators,'' in his approach to China. Since then, Clinton has
jerked from one China policy to the next, first ignoring the
country because of human rights. In 1996, in a low point in the
relationship, Clinton dispatched two aircraft carriers to the
Chinese coast after authorities lobbed a series of missiles towards
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Within the past two years, the White House has settled on a
strategy it describes as engagement, designed to involve Chinese
leaders in high level discussions with the hope of spurring change.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be those here and back in America who wonder whether
closer ties and deeper friendship between America and China are
good,'' Clinton said last night. ``Clearly, the answer is yes. We
have a powerful ability to help each other grow. We can learn much
from each other. And as two great nations, we have a special
responsibility to the future of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In many respects, Clinton arrived to a far different China than
even the one Bush left behind a decade ago. As he stood with his
back to the venerable city wall last night, Clinton looked out
toward a glittering office tower -- a bank building --in downtown
Xian. Nearby billboards defined the virtues of various brands of
liquor, while the drummers in warrior costumes puffed cigarettes
between sets and took pulls from metal flasks.

EDDIE MURPHY RUNS WITH THE PACK, BUT IT ISN'T ENOUGH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stand-up comic Richard Lewis used to do a joke about his mother
laying such a guilt trip on his family that their dog became
neurotic; it would cough before it barked.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is about the only comedian missing from the ranks of the
comics who voice the animals in the remake of ``Dr. Dolittle,''
starring Eddie Murphy (see sidebar). Albert Brooks is the furry
creature who could've come out of Lewis' mom's house: a headachy,
suicidal tiger.
</P>
<P>
   This roster of comics gives ``Dr. Dolittle'' most of its charm.
Otherwise, it's a strange spectacle _ a family comedy with a bunch
of raunchy remarks you wouldn't expect to see in a picture aimed at
kids and their parents. But then, you wouldn't expect to see Eddie
Murphy in a film for the whole family, unless it was the Wu Tang
Clan.
</P>
<P>
   But Murphy, with a headful of sculpted dreadlocks and intoning
his lines in his best Dark Gable voice, slides through the picture.
He plays a grown-up; family man Dr. John Dolittle, who has
repressed childhood memories of talking to the animals.
(Specifically, his dog, voiced by Ellen DeGeneres.) He scoots
around wearing a pair of glasses and having little patience for
animals, of course, and for anything that's the slightest bit
weird.
</P>
<P>
   When he almost runs over a wandering pooch (Norm MacDonald), he
suddenly starts to hear the animals _ all of them _ talking again.
This, of course, greatly annoys his wife (the shockingly gorgeous
Kristen Wilson) and his greedy partner (Oliver Platt), who wants to
sell their medical practice to a corporation run by the indifferent
Peter Boyle.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting the rapidly growing crew of animals who seek him out
with their ailments, Dolittle learns to get in touch with his inner
freak, thereby exemplifying the lesson he teaches one of his kids:
Be yourself and love yourself, because geniuses were considered
weird, too. (He then recites a list of geniuses _ Albert Einstein,
Muhammed Ali _ fresh from those annoying ``Think Different'' Apple
ads.)
</P>
<P>
   Betty Thomas (''Private Parts,'' ``The Brady Bunch Movie'')
directs in a style best described as slapdash, and _ in an age when
even the lamest movies look polished, if impersonal _ delivers one
of the lousiest-looking major-studio releases in some time.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Thomas persists in using Steven Gilborn, the
skilled actor best known for his role as ``Ellen's'' befuddled dad.
He made quite an impression in ``The Late Shift,'' the HBO movie
about the Leno/Letterman feud, which was also directed by Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone expecting a connection to the first ``Dr. Dolittle''
movie will have to make do with a quick glimpse of the
pushmi-pullyou in the background, and a bit of Louis Armstrong's
lovely cover of ``Talk to the Animals.'' The movie is energetic,
occasionally amusing, and mostly painless. Even for those who may
think they've lived too long when an Eddie Murphy movie becomes an
Afterschool Special.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Look who's talking
</P>
<P>
   An impressive roster of comics gives voice to the animals in
``Dr. Dolittle:''
</P>
<P>
   Norm MacDonald is the mutt whose narration starts the story.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen DeGeneres and Gilbert Gottfried join him as canines in
cameos.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Rock is the lascivious, hungry guinea pig.
</P>
<P>
   Garry Shandling and Julie Kavner are a pair of feuding pigeons.
</P>
<P>
   Jenna Elfman is a wounded owl.
</P>
<P>
   John Leguizamo is a rat.
</P>
<P>
   Paul ``Pee-wee'' Reubens is a raccoon.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Brooks is a depressed tiger.

   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from Thursday's Supreme
Court opinion that the lawyer-client privilege survives the death
of the client. The opinion in the case, Swidler &AMP; Berlin and James
Hamilton vs. United States, was written by Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, Anthony M.
Kennedy, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G.
Breyer. A dissenting opinion, which is also excerpted below, was
filed by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and joined by Justices Antonin
Scalia and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   FROM THE DECISION
</P>
<P>
   By Justice Rehnquist
</P>
<P>
   This dispute arises out of an investigation conducted by the
office of the independent counsel into whether various individuals
made false statements, obstructed justice, or committed other
crimes during investigations of the 1993 dismissal of employees
from the White House travel office. Vincent W. Foster Jr. was
deputy White House counsel when the firings occurred. In July 1993,
Foster met with petitioner James Hamilton, an attorney at
petitioner Swidler Berlin, to seek legal representation concerning
possible Congressional or other investigations of the firings.
During a two-hour meeting, Hamilton took three pages of handwritten
notes. One of the first entries in the notes is the word
``Privileged.'' Nine days later, Foster committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1995, a Federal grand jury, at the request of the
independent counsel, issued subpoenas to petitioners Hamilton and
Swidler Berlin for, inter alia, Hamilton's handwritten notes of his
meeting with Foster. Petitioners filed a motion to quash, arguing
that the notes were protected by the attorney-client privilege and
by the work product privilege. The District Court, after examining
the notes in camera, concluded they were protected from disclosure
by both doctrines and denied enforcement of the subpoenas.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
reversed.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney-client privilege is one of the oldest recognized
privileges for confidential communications. The privilege is
intended to encourage ``full and frank communication between
attorneys and their clients and thereby promote broader public
interests in the observance of law and the administration of
justice.'' The issue presented here is the scope of that privilege;
more particularly, the extent to which the privilege survives the
death of the client. Our interpretation of the privilege's scope is
guided by ``the principles of the common law as interpreted by the
courts in the light of reason and experience.'' Federal Rules of
Evidence 501.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel argues that the attorney-client
privilege should not prevent disclosure of confidential
communications where the client has died and the information is
relevant to a criminal proceeding. There is some authority for this
position. One state appellate court and the Court of Appeals below
have held the privilege may be subject to posthumous exceptions in
certain circumstances. But other than these two decisions, cases
addressing the existence of the privilege after death most
involving the testamentary exception uniformly presume the
privilege survives, even if they do not so hold. Such testamentary
exception cases consistently presume the privilege survives.
</P>
<P>
   The great body of this case law supports, either by holding or
considered dicta, the position that the privilege does survive in a
case such as the present one. Given the language of Rule 501, at
the very least the burden is on the independent counsel to show
that ``reason and experience'' require a departure from this rule.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel contends that the testamentary exception
supports the posthumous termination of the privilege because in
practice most cases have refused to apply the privilege
posthumously. He further argues that the exception reflects a
policy judgment that the interest in settling estates outweighs any
posthumous interest in confidentiality. He then reasons by analogy
that in criminal proceedings, the interest in determining whether a
crime has been committed should trump client confidentiality,
particularly since the financial interests of the estate are not at
stake.
</P>
<P>
   But the independent counsel's interpretation simply does not
square with the case law's implicit acceptance of the privilege's
survival and with the treatment of testamentary disclosure as an
``exception'' or an implied ``waiver.'' And the premise of his
analogy is incorrect, since cases consistently recognize that the
rationale for the testamentary exception is that it furthers the
client's intent. There is no reason to suppose as a general matter
that grand jury testimony about confidential communications
furthers the client's intent.
</P>
<P>
   We think there are weighty reasons that counsel in favor of
posthumous application. Knowing that communications will remain
confidential even after death encourages the client to communicate
fully and frankly with counsel. While the fear of disclosure, and
the consequent withholding of information from counsel, may be
reduced if disclosure is limited to posthumous disclosure in a
criminal context, it seems unreasonable to assume that it vanishes
altogether. Clients may be concerned about reputation, civil
liability, or possible harm to friends or family. Posthumous
disclosure of such communications may be as feared as disclosure
during the client's lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel suggests, however, that his proposed
exception would have little to no effect on the client's
willingness to confide in his attorney. He reasons that only
clients intending to perjure themselves will be chilled by a rule
of disclosure after death, as opposed to truthful clients or those
asserting their Fifth Amendment privilege. This is because for the
latter group, communications disclosed by the attorney after the
client's death purportedly will reveal only information that the
client himself would have revealed if alive.
</P>
<P>
   The indepeldent counsel assumes, incorrectly we believe, that
the privilege is analogous to the Fifth Amendment's protection
against self-incrimination. But as suggested above, the privilege
serves much broader purposes. Clients consult attorneys for a wide
variety of reasons, only one of which involves possible criminal
liability. Many attorneys act as counselors on personal and family
matters, where, in the course of obtaining the desired advice,
confidences about family members or financial problems must be
revealed in order to assure sound legal advice. The same is true of
owners of small businesses who mayregularly consult their attorneys
about a variety of problems arising in the course of the business.
These confidences may not come close to any sort of admission of
criminal wrongdoing, but nonetheless be matters which the client
would not wish divulged.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The contention that the attorney is being required to disclose
only what the client could have been required to disclose is at
odds with the basis for the privilege even during the client's
lifetime. In related cases, we have said that the loss of evidence
admittedly caused by the privilege is justified in part by the fact
that without the privilege, the client may not have made such
communications in the first place. This is true of disclosure
before and after the client's death. Without assurance of the
privilege's posthumous application, the client may very well not
have made disclosures to his attorney at all, so the loss of
evidence is more apparent than real. In the case at hand, it seems
quite plausible that Foster, perhaps already contemplating suicide,
may not have sought legal advice from Hamilton if he had not been
assured the conversation was privileged.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel additionally suggests that his proposed
exception would have minimal impact if confined to criminal cases,
or, as the Court of Appeals suggests, if it is limited to
information of substantial importance to a particular criminal
case. However, there is no case authority for the proposition that
the privilege applies differently in criminal and civil cases. In
any event, a client may not know at the time he discloses
information to his attorney whether it will later be relevant to a
civil or a criminal matter, let alone whether it will be of
substantial importance. Balancing ex post the importance of the
information against client interests, even limited to criminal
cases, introduces substantial uncertainty into the privilege's
application. For just that reason, we have rejected use of a
balancing test in defining the contours of the privilege.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar vein, the independent counsel argues that existing
exceptions to the privilege, such as the crime-fraud exception and
the testamentary exception, make the impact of one more exception
marginal. However, these exceptions do not demonstrate that the
impact of a posthumous exception would be insignificant, and there
is little empirical evidence on this point. The established
exceptions are consistent with the purposes of the privilege, while
a posthumous exception in criminal cases appears at odds with the
goals of encouraging full and frank communication and of protecting
the client's interests. A ``no-harm-in-one-more-exception''
rationale could contribute to the general erosion of the privilege,
without reference to common law principles or ``reason and
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been generally, if not universally, accepted, for well
over a century, that the attorney-client privilege survives the
death of the client in a case such as this. While the arguments
against the survival of the privilege are by no means frivolous,
they are based in large part on speculation, thoughtful
speculation, but speculation nonetheless as to whether posthumous
termination of the privilege would diminish a client's willingness
to confide in an attorney. In an area where empirical information
would be useful, it is scant and inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 501's direction to look to ``the principles of the common
law as they may be interpreted by the courts of the United States
in the light of reason and experience'' does not mandate that a
rule, once established, should endure for all time. But here the
independent counsel has simply not made a sufficient showing to
overturn the common-law rule embodied in the prevailing case law.
Interpreted in the light of reason and experience, that body of law
requires that the attorney-client privilege prevent disclosure of
the notes at issue in this case.
</P>
<P>
   FROM THE DISSENT
</P>
<P>
   By Justice O'Connor
</P>
<P>
   Although the attorney-client privilege ordinarily will survive
the death of the client, I do not agree with the Court that it
inevitably precludes disclosure of a deceased client's
communications in criminal proceedings. In my view, a criminal
defendant's right to exculpatory evidence or a compelling law
enforcement need for information may, where the testimony is not
available from other sources, override a client's posthumous
interest in confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   We have long recognized that ``(t)he fundamental basis upon
which all rules of evidence must rest if they are to rest upon
reason is their adaptation to the successful development of the
truth.'' In light of the heavy burden that they place on the search
for truth, see United States vs. Nixon (1974), ``(e)videntiary
privileges in litigation are not favored, and even those rooted in
the Constitution must give way in proper circumstances.''
Consequently, we construe the scope of privileges narrowly. We are
reluctant to recognize a privilege or read an existing one
expansively unless to do so will serve a ``public good transcending
the normally predominant principle of utilizing all rational means
for ascertaining truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorney-client privilege promotes trust in the
representational relationship, thereby facilitating the provision
of legal services and ultimately the administration of justice. The
systemic benefits of the privilege are commonly understood to
outweigh the harm caused by excluding critical evidence. A
privilege should operate, however, only where ``necessary to
achieve its purpose,'' and an invocation of the attorney-client
privilege should not go unexamined ``when it is shown that the
interests of the administration of justice can only be frustrated
by (its) exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   I agree that a deceased client may retain a personal,
reputational and economic interest in confidentiality. But, after
death, the potential that disclosure will harm the client's
interests has been greatly diminished, and the risk that the client
will be held criminally liable has abated altogether.
</P>
<P>
   This diminished risk is coupled with a heightened urgency for
discovery of a deceased client's communications in the criminal
context. The privilege does not ``protect disclosure of the
underlying facts by those who communicated with the attorney,'' and
were the client living, prosecutors could grant immunity and compel
the relevant testimony. After a client's death, however, if the
privilege precludes an attorney from testifying in the client's
stead, a complete ``loss of crucial information'' will often
result.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As the Court of Appeals observed, the costs of recognizing an
absolute posthumous privilege can be inordinately high. Extreme
injustice may occur, for example, where a criminal defendant seeks
disclosure of a deceased client's confession to the offense. In my
view, the paramount value that our criminal justice system places
on protecting an innocent defendant should outweigh a deceased
client's interest in preserving confidences. Indeed, even
petitioner acknowledges that an exception may be appropriate where
the constitutional rights of a criminal defendant are at stake.
</P>
<P>
   An exception may likewise be warranted in the face of a
compelling law enforcement need for the information. ``(O)ur
historic commitment to the rule of law is nowhere more profoundly
manifest than in our view that the twofold aim of criminal justice
is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that the complete exclusion of relevant evidence from a
criminal trial or investigation may distort the record, mislead the
fact finder, and undermine the central truth-seeking function of
the courts, I do not believe that the attorney-client privilege
should act as an absolute bar to the disclosure of a deceased
client's communications. When the privilege is asserted in the
criminal context, and a showing is made that the communications at
issue contain necessary factual information not otherwise
available, courts should be permitted to assess whether interests
in fairness and accuracy outweigh the justifications for the
privilege.
</P>
<P>
   In the situation where the posthumous privilege most frequently
arises, a dispute between heirs over the decedent's will, the
privilege is widely recognized to give way to the interest in
settling the estate. This testamentary exception, moreover, may be
invoked in some cases where the decedent would not have chosen to
waive the privilege. For example, ``a decedent might want to
provide for an illegitimate child but at the same time much prefer
that the relationship go undisclosed.'' Among the Court's
rationales for a broad construction of the posthumous privilege is
its assertion that ``(m)any attorneys act as counselors on personal
and family matters, where, in the course of obtaining the desired
advice, confidences about family members or financial problems must
be revealed . . . which the client would not wish divulged.''
</P>
<P>
   That reasoning, however, would apply in the testamentary context
with equal force. Nor are other existing exceptions to the
privilege for example, the crime-fraud exception or the exceptions
for claims relating to attorney competence or compensation
necessarily consistent with ``encouraging full and frank
communication'' or ``protecting the client's interests.'' Rather,
those exceptions reflect the understanding that, in certain
circumstances, the privilege ``ceases to operate'' as a safeguard
on ``the proper functioning of our adversary system.''
</P>
<P>
   Where the exoneration of an innocent criminal defendant or a
compelling law enforcement interest is at stake, the harm of
precluding critical evidence that is unavailable by any other means
outweighs the potential disincentive to forthright communication.
In my view, the cost of silence warrants a narrow exception to the
rule that the attorney-client privilege survives the death of the
client.

AGASSI, CAPRIATI LEFT WITH THEIR MEMORIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Fixing hed)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Andre Agassi is saying, ``Life doesn't wait for you,''
and Jennifer Capriati is saying nothing that enlightening, just
packing her bags and wondering how she could lose to somebody ready
for Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   He's right, she's bewildered, and those Sisters Sledgehammer _
Venus and Serena _ are what's happening at Wimbledon if you're
talking about latter-day bundles to Britain from the USA.
</P>
<P>
   It's not so far back that the ``Jenerator'' _ Jenny Capriati _
was throwing off sparks and power around this place, bumping off
the champ, Martina Navratilova, and perching in the semifinals. She
was 15. It was 1991. Or that Andre Agassi was making rubber lemons
magically vanish with his gut-strung wand as foes scuttled about
feverishly and vainly trying to find them. He was 22, the new
champion. It was 1992.
</P>
<P>
   A twinkling ago, but a century in sports. Jenny and Andre were
the child phenoms of their day _ Thursdays _ but this time they
were out on the curb among remnants in the Wimbledon discard pile,
along with the empty champagne bottles and the plastic bowls that
contained the signature treat, overpriced strawberries and cream.
</P>
<P>
   Andre was hanging from a very high window sill and Jenny from a
very low ranking when they reported for duty Thursday, an afternoon
subjecting 36,003 parishioners to a blend of rain, sunshine, and
tricky gusts. Once Professor Nick Bollettieri's glittering pupil,
Agassi was left dangling perilously at nightfall Wednesday by his
successor as teacher's pet, 20-year-old Tommy Haas. Haas led, two
sets to one, towering, at 6 feet 2 inches, over Andre in stature
and, surprisingly, in shotmaking.
</P>
<P>
   When they returned to Centre Court for Act II, Haas started
shakily, losing serve. Andre held for 2-0 and had two break points
for 3-0. The old pro was OK. Not for long. Haas, who grew up at the
Bollettieri Academy in Bradenton, Fla., ``looking up to Andre,
admiring him,'' turned on his own muscle and won their Thursday set
to complete a 4-6, 6-1, 7-6 (7-4), 6-4 triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi feels ``there's more good tennis in me. It'll come back
like his form did for Michael Jordan. But it took him a while after
he quit baseball. I have time _ but life doesn't wait.'' It does
when Jordan takes wing.
</P>
<P>
   The dismal facts, however: Agassi has lost his last two starts
to relative nobodies, and these matches happened to be
first-rounders at the French (Russian qualifier Marat Safin) and
now Wimbledon and No. 44 Haas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andre used to play with me once in a while at the academy,''
says Haas, a German, who acts and talks like an American kid but is
billed in the fatherland as the next Boris Becker. ``But I couldn't
stay close to him the first time we played as pros, Scottsdale in
March (6-2, 6-1). So this is very special, to beat Andre on the
court where he won Wimbledon in 1992.''
</P>
<P>
   Capriati, drifting, rudderless, ranked No. 151 and in on a
freebie as a wild card, hadn't passed through the tall iron Doherty
Gates at the All England Club entrance since 1993, when she lost a
tough quarterfinal to the champion, Steffi Graf. It was a last
moment of glory before her personal troubles hijacked the immense
promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, you know, I think my comeback is going well, you know,''
she says, chewing gum and scores of conversational ``you know's.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to be back here after so long. I think I'm playing
even better than in 1991 and 1992.''
</P>
<P>
   The flimsy 4-6, 6-4, 6-2 defeat by another wild card,
34-year-old, downwinding Lori McNeil, testifies otherwise, speaks
of self-delusion.
</P>
<P>
   You feel for Jennifer. Rich, a good kid, but in need of
direction to find out what she really wants. If it is tennis, then
she requires a coach to get her in shape, care about her _ far from
the father who made her the family provider at 13, pushed her and
played her when she was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Products of a different, more careful parental environment,
Venus and Serena Williams are cruising joyfully toward a
fourth-round collision. Venus, setting a female speed record with a
125-mile-per-hour serve for one of six aces _ not many guys can
match that _ beat Barbara Schett, 6-1, 6-2, in her second-rounder.
Serena, in a ``really special moment, my first time on Centre
Court,'' whomped the Croatian teen whiz, 16-year-old Mirjana Lucic,
6-3, 6-0, in 48 minutes, undercutting big sister's clocking by five
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like grass,'' says Serena after merely her fifth
match lifetime on same. ``But it doesn't matter what surface. I
adjust fast. But you know what I don't like about Venus? She's so
much taller than I am (4 inches at 6-2). She can serve faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Venus retorts, with a great smile, ``You know what I don't like
about Serena? She steals my cookies. Oatmeal raisin today. But I
watched her first set. Serena's a juggernaut. I predict the winner
of our match will win the tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   What does it take to beat a juggernaut? ``A nemesis,'' replies
Venus. ``I'm a nemesis.'' Laughter takes over.
</P>
<P>
   Andre and Jennifer can remember when they were juggernauts.

BOHDAN STRUMINSKI, LINGUIST, 68; FOUGHT SOVIET LANGUAGE POLICIES

<P>
   Bohdan A. Struminski, a linguist and translator who spent three
years in a Polish prison for protesting Soviet language policies in
the Ukraine, died of cancer Tuesday in his home in Arlington, Mass.
He was 68.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Struminski was a specialist in Ukrainian, Polish, and Old
Slavic languages. He was the author of ``Linguistic Interrelations
in Early Rus'' and a translator of scholarly source materials for
the series Early Ukrainian Literature published by Harvard
University and the University of Alberta. He also translated
Czeslaw Milosz's ``The Captive Mind'' from Polish into Ukrainian
and was the author of more than 100 scholarly articles.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Bialystok, Poland, the city for which the bialy,
a round, flat bread roll, is named. He graduated from Warsaw
University, where he also earned a doctorate in philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, he was convicted of anti-Soviet activities for
protesting Soviet language policies in the Ukraine and spent nearly
three years in a Polish prison.
</P>
<P>
   He came to the United States in 1975 and was a visiting
professor at Harvard University until 1979, when he became a
research associate at the Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute,
where he remained until his retirement in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   He contributed to Polish and Ukrainian literary publications
such as ``Kultura'' and ``Suchasnist'' under the pen names A.
Skiwski and D. Bajurs'kyj.
</P>
<P>
   Though he bristled at the term Polish-American, he was
editor-in-chief of Zycie Polonii, a publication of the Eastern
Massachusetts division of the Polish-American Congress. In a story
published in the Polish American Journal on Jan. 1, 1994, he
described himself as a ``Polish citizen residing in America.'' He
denounced the Polish-American title ``because,'' he said, ``it
would suggest that I am only a vestigial Pole, still liking the
polka and kielbasa, but no longer a perfect speaker of Polish, with
all the cultural, historical and psychological consequences
thereof.''
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Kathleen M. Lestition; and a son, Igor of
Poland.

OF HIGH MOMENTS AND THE HORSE YOU RODE IN ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release on Sunday, June 28.)  
 (EDS: Repeating for all needing. Items in boldface should be set in
italics.)

 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``This case is of  &UR; high moment &LR; ,'' wrote Independent Counsel Ken
Starr to the Supreme Court, because it involved ``fundamental
constitutional issues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are fallen upon times,'' promulgated Pope Leo XIII in an
encyclical a century ago, ``when a violent and well-nigh daily
battle is being fought about matters of  &UR; highest moment &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   ``Considerations of  &UR; high moment &LR;  call on the American,'' wrote
The Southern Literary Messenger in 1839, ``... to extend and
disseminate every facility which our country can afford, for the
promotion of information. Upon this pillar rests the question of
man's capability for self-government.''
</P>
<P>
   Heavy stuff. In dealing with the voguish, momentary popularity
of  &UR; moments &LR;  in this space recently ( &UR; senior moments &LR; ,  &UR; Zen &LR; 
moments,  &UR; Maalox moments &LR; ), I neglected the essence of the word
expressed in the adjective  &UR; momentous &LR; : ``of great weight; of major
significance.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Moment &LR; , in this sense, seems like one of those Janus words
with opposite meanings, like  &UR; sanction &LR;  (penalty; approval) or
 &UR; sanguine &LR;  (bloody; optimistic). How can  &UR; moment &LR;  be both
``fleeting'' and ``of consequence''?
</P>
<P>
   Look to the Latin  &UR; momentum &LR; , ``movement.'' When you place a
tiny particle on a perfectly balanced scale, you cause it to move;
thus, even a time of incalculable briefness or the lightest weight
of an argument, when added to one of the scales in equilibrium,
breaks the balance and creates movement, which gains momentum,
changes minds and moves the world. That's how a transitory moment
can be of  &UR; high moment &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &UR; High &LR; , in this phrase, means ``significant'' _ more than in
``high official,'' as much as in ``high crimes'' or ``high
dudgeon.'' Fred Shapiro, co-editor of ``Trial and Error: An Oxford
Anthology of Legal Stories,'' tracks  &UR; high moment &LR;  back in legal
usage to an 1861 opinion condemning a Confederate ship for
violating a Union blockade.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when  &UR; important &LR;  has lost its zip,  &UR; significant &LR;  is
too lightly bandied about, and even  &UR; consequential &LR;  lacks gravamen,
it's comforting to see  &UR; moment &LR;  regaining its moment.
</P>
<P>
   AND THE HORSE YOU RODE IN ON
</P>
<P>
   James Carville, the best-selling author and keen debater who is
President Clinton's most unwavering loyalist, is writing a book for
Simon &AMP; Schuster about a group he calls ``the president's
enemies,'' foremost among them prosecutor Ken Starr. The Louisianan
whose sobriquet is ``the Ragin' Cajun'' has chosen a tentative
title: ``... And the Horse You Rode In On.'' That title is intended
to strike a note of defiance. As Thomas Bowdler might expurgate it,
``Be off with you and, for emphasis, take with you whatever brought
you to this point.'' As the ellipsis indicates, the obscene
beginning of the line is cut: The missing words can be any of a
variety of contemptuous imprecations, none of which are suitable
for book titles or family newspapers. But because the concluding
trope is so widely known _ and its origin such a mystery to
students of English as a foreign language _ the burden of
explication falls to the linguistic mavenim.
</P>
<P>
   The country-music songwriters D. Rock, C. Blake and B. Fischer
titled their 1989 ditty ``You and the Horse (You Rode In On).'' A
year later, the group called Soul Asylum used the phrase as an
album title, and a variant was the title of a 1993 mystery novel by
Martha Grimes. A 1992 self-help paperback by Bill Wear used it in a
subtitle: ``Recovering From Divorce: And the Horse You Rode In
On,'' presumably expressing the confrontational attitude of an
offended former spouse.
</P>
<P>
   The first use in fictional dialogue that I can find is in George
V. Higgins' 1972 classic hard-boiled novel, ``The Friends of Eddie
Coyle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I first heard it when I was driving a truck for Coca-Cola,''
recalls Higgins, whose most recent novel is ``A Change of
Gravity.'' ``It must have been about the summer of 1960.'' The late
'50s appears to be the time of the phrase's genesis; Michael
Seidman, editor of Charles Durden's 1976 ``No Bugles, No Drums,''
another novel using the entire line, remembers the insult he heard
growing up in the Bronx in that post-Korean War era: ``... and the
white horse you rode in on and all your relatives in Brooklyn.''
</P>
<P>
   The key word is  &UR; in &LR; . ``The horse he rode on,'' without the
necessary  &UR; in &LR;  to conjure the image of a scene, is an ordinary
phrase that can be found in use as far back as Shakespeare. (``Some
hilding fellow, that had stolen the horse he rode on,'' with
 &UR; hilding &LR;  meaning ``bent downward, twisted waywardly aside.'') But
 &UR; rode in on &LR;  suggests a startling entrance.
</P>
<P>
   A clue to the term's origin is immortalized in the halls of the
Treasury Department in Washington. In the background of the oil
painting that hangs as the official portrait of Donald Regan, who
served as secretary of the Treasury in the Reagan administration,
can be found a book titled ``And the Horse You Rode In On.'' No
other book title is visible. In their 1987 book, ``Showdown at
Gucci Gulch,'' Jeffrey H. Birnbaum and Alan S. Murray, then
reporters for The Wall Street Journal, note that it was not a real
book title but rather a favorite saying of Regan's. He attributed
it to his friend, John ``Buck'' Chapoton, who claimed he heard the
phrase appended to its obscene imperative during a poker game in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   This is an example of a vestigial metaphor. It occurs in such
phrases as ``my turn in the barrel'' or ``where were you when,
etc.'' The jokes or anecdotes are deservedly forgotten, but the
punch lines, or portions of them, live on. In this case, though the
sentiment is not as elegantly expressed as in Churchill's
alliterative ``in defeat, defiance,'' the intensifying message
stands tall in the linguistic saddle. &QL;

   SALMON-SAVE (Undated) Efforts to save endangered Puget Sound
salmon runs have gotten a boost from Washington's two U.S.

Washington Gov. Gary Locke requested for a restoration project. But
under an appropriation bill that includes much of that $30 million,
efforts to restore depleted salmon runs in other parts of the state
are severely limited _ largely because of efforts by Sen. Slade
Gorton, R-Wash. The entire bill Interior Department appropriations

CROWDS LINE CHINA'S STREETS TO GREET CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: CHINA-CLINTON, CHINA-DISSIDENTS, CHINA-PEONY) 
(ps) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   XIAN, China _ On this steamy summer night, the people of Xian
took to the streets Thursday to welcome President Clinton on the
first stop of his state visit, in what many here said was one of
the largest spontaneous gatherings they could remember.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never been another event like this here, I don't think
I've ever seen this many people come out for anything,'' said Sun
Qinqi, an engineer, who said he had decided to pass up televised
soccer matches from the World Cup to cram onto the sidewalk just
inside the old city's South Gate to catch a glimpse of the
presidential motorcade's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   He scanned the high-spirited crowd wondering aloud: Did more
people turn out to celebrate the arrest of the infamous Gang of
Four in 1976, which brought the decade-long Cultural Revolution to
an end? Were there more in the spring of 1989, when people gathered
to express sympathy for demonstrators in Beijing's Tiananmen
Square?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he concluded, ``there just weren't so many then.''
</P>
<P>
   As early as 9 Thursday morning, factory workers, students,
bankers and public officials started vying for position on the
sidewalks around the square before the city's South Gate, where the
president was to give a short speech. And by Thursday evening, a
crowd five deep extended out of the square for two miles down South
Avenue, along the route Clinton was rumored to be taking back to
his hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a massive police presence, the green uniformed officers
stoically tolerated a large, ebullient crowd of spectators that
perched in trees and atop newspaper kiosks. They watched as men in
Adidas shirts and women carrying beepers jumped blithely over the
barricades in front of Kentucky Fried Chicken to applaud when the
president's black limousine, bearing American and Chinese flags,
finally passed.
</P>
<P>
   It was a heady evening for Xian, the once-proud capital of
ancient China, that in recent years has been plagued by a stagnant
economy and hundreds of thousands of layoffs. Indeed, many
enthusiasts expressed hope that Clinton's visit would help restore
Xian's name _ or at least bring new business opportunities to town.
</P>
<P>
   The young, diverse crowd's open chattiness, spontaneity and
optimism reflected the greater freedoms Chinese enjoy today. But
this was also a celebration that excluded _ at times forcibly _
those elements of Chinese society that have not fit into the
government's reforms, like Liu Guiqing, a poor pedicab driver, who
was three weeks ago ordered off the streets, or Fu Sheng, a
political dissident who was forced on Wednesday to leave town.
</P>
<P>
   On the street Thursday night, few seemed to mind that they could
neither see the elaborate welcoming ceremony nor hear the president
speak.
</P>
<P>
   Gu Fuyin, a factory director, and his wife, Cao Mingli, had
dressed up, brought stools and waited four hours to catch a glimpse
of the motorcade. Some work places had urged their employees to be
welcoming toward Clinton. Nonetheless, the middle-aged couple
marveled at a celebration that was ``spontaneous'' and ``not
required by politics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The two country's relations are developing quickly and now we
are feeling much more friendly,'' Gu explained.
</P>
<P>
   Ren Liansheng, 25, a Xian native who is currently working on a
construction project in Gansu, took off three days to attend the
event.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of the United States welcomed Jiang Zemin last
year,'' he said. ``Also, this is great for Xian, to promote
economic development.''
</P>
<P>
   And Li Yuhua, 45, a factory worker in a flower print dress who
was crammed onto the sidewalk just across from the magnificent
South Gate, only slightly overstepped the mood of the crowd when
she exclaimed: ``He's young and he's achieved so much. And we hope
he'll achieve more. He's an epic-making man.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Clinton's plane touched down shopkeepers could
feel the benefits of his visit.
</P>
<P>
   On Wenyibei Street, a bustling commercial street outside the
city wall, Jia Jiwan, 34, had decorated the window of his
fashionable clothing store with pictures of the president and the
message ``Welcome to Xian Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We always say we should grasp the opportunity to reinvigorate
the economy and this is like a windfall,'' he said. ``So this visit
could be a turning point. Afterward, Xian _ and its products _ will
be better known in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   At a small outdoor market near Xian's beautifully ornate
18th-century Bell Tower, Lu Xiurong, 47, said the impending arrival
of Clinton had done wonders for her business, which sells
children's clothes, skimpy underwear and bras.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just saying how happy we were he is coming,'' said Ms.
Lu. ``When the people are in a good mood, as they are now, they
wander through the market and buy.'' She said that sales had
increased 60 percent in the last two weeks, with American-flag
pajamas a best seller.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   A sales girl at the state-owned Foreign Language Bookstore said
that 200 copies of a Chinese book about President Jiang Zemin's
visit to the United States last fall had sold out in two days last
week, and sales of translations of American novels had doubled in
recent days.
</P>
<P>
   But other businesses did not fare so well.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, a 45-year-old widow named Liu Guiqing who had
been laid off from a candy factory paid $100 for a pedicab that she
drove to support her two children.
</P>
<P>
   But on June 1, Xian police informed Ms. Liu and other pedicab
drivers that they could no longer ride in the city center. The move
supposedly was to relieve Xian's traffic congestion, but she and
many others say the Clinton visit was to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say that these look bad, are not modern, that modern
people take taxi cabs,'' sniffed an elderly driver who would only
give his name as Lu. Lu's fancy pedicab, with its stripped canopy
and lace curtain, slowly moved alongside the city's North Wall,
hauling only a large tank of cooking gas.
</P>
<P>
   With no other way to make money, Ms. Liu has decided to play the
odds, in order to earn a few dollars a night. In a city center now
devoid of pedicabs, she goes out after nightfall and turns down
rides that involve traveling on main thoroughfares.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen a few police trucks but they have so far left me
alone,'' she said. ``I think its because I am a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, as Clinton was traveling to Xian, Fu Sheng was
aboard a train out of the city, to the seaport of Qingdao. Fu, 38,
who in 1989 had led Xian workers in a demonstration to support the
protests in Beijing, was ordered to leave town before Clinton's
arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Three times in recent weeks, the party secretary at Fu's work
place, the Xian Institute of Navigation, gave him the choice of
being laid off or going to Qingdao.
</P>
<P>
   When he finally left, he was accompanied by a co-worker assigned
to make sure that he arrived at his destination. But he was upset
that he had to leave Xian while his wife had to work and his
9-year-old was preparing for examinations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The meeting between the Americans and the Chinese is a good
thing, another handshake,'' he said before his departure. ``But why
have authorities violated my rights?''

A RUSH TO JUDGMENT IN CLINTON'S CASE IS DANGEROUS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 28)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bill Clinton has one indisputable claim that sets
him apart from all his predecessors. His private life has been
scrutinized more meticulously than that of any president before
him.
</P>
<P>
   The House, the Senate, independent counsels, the Justice
Department and the news media all have peered with microscopic
thoroughness into the doings of the current commander-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   In a number of administrations, investigators have looked
closely at the president _ the sins he might have committed, the
secret commitments he might have made, the promises he reneged on,
the relationships he depended on and the activities he indulged in.
</P>
<P>
   Ulysses S. Grant, Warren G. Harding, Harry S Truman, Richard M.
Nixon and Ronald Reagan are among those whose machinations have
been carefully dissected.
</P>
<P>
   When Republicans reclaimed control of Congress in 1947 after 14
years of Democratic rule over the White House and Capitol Hill,
they launched lengthy inquiries into the late Franklin D.
Roosevelt's conduct during the months leading up to the 1941
Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the commitments he made to the
Soviet Union's Josef Stalin at the Yalta conference in 1945. The
probes produced little of substance.
</P>
<P>
   But never has there been anything to equal the spectacle of the
Clinton years.
</P>
<P>
   The investigative focus has fallen not just on the president,
but also on the vice president, the first lady, several Cabinet
members, White House aides, party fund-raisers and men and women
with whom Clinton did business before becoming president.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans are weary of the continuing inquiries and the
money and time that have been expended on them. According to the
latest NBC-Wall Street Journal poll, 83 percent of the respondents
said they are tired of the probes and 63 percent said they approve
of Clinton's presidential performance. Still, others hope for a
more intensified probe of the president, with impeachment as their
goal.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the whole process, as far as much of the public is
concerned, has come down to a question of whether Clinton had sex
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky and whether he lied
under oath about it and sought the help of others in a cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   There are many other facets of the Clinton investigation, all
jammed together under the umbrella called Whitewater. But to most
Americans, the Lewinsky affair is the key to his fate and his
future. The closest parallel to an investigation endangering a
president's tenure would be the Watergate probe of Nixon in the
early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   When Nixon finally bowed to reality and resigned in 1974, it was
because White House tapes revealed that he had sought to obstruct
justice by using the CIA and the FBI to cover up wrongdoing. But no
one ever suspected Nixon of having a secret sex life.
</P>
<P>
   The current situation is considerably different.
</P>
<P>
   When the founding fathers provided in the Constitution for
impeachment of a president, it is doubtful that any of them
anticipated that an extramarital relationship would be labeled a
high crime or misdemeanor or that it would become the vehicle to
carry a president permanently out of the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Treason, theft or a deliberate subversion of the Constitution
are grounds for impeachment. But some of the good founders
themselves may have indulged in private illicit sex without
endangering their public careers.
</P>
<P>
   The question that must resolved eventually, therefore, is
whether Clinton attempted to obstruct justice by lying and getting
others to lie about the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   There is a tendency to believe that presidents are different
from the rest of us because their scale of living is so at odds
with that of the average American. They reside for a limited period
of time, usually four years or eight, in a great white mansion on
Pennsylvania Avenue and fly off to Camp David in Maryland's
Catoctin Mountains for quiet weekends.
</P>
<P>
   They travel in chauffeur-driven limousines, helicopters and a
Boeing 747 known as Air Force One. They are protected by a constant
coterie of Secret Service agents and have all menial tasks
performed for them.
</P>
<P>
   When their presidency ends, they draw a nice pension and pick up
additional cash by writing books, lecturing and/or serving on
boards of directors. With large contributions from private donors,
they establish libraries and museums that recount the glories of
their White House years and provide visitors with a fascinating
panorama of history.
</P>
<P>
   In that after-the-presidency life, they continue to have Secret
Service protection, office help and other benefits paid by the
government.
</P>
<P>
   But basically, they are like the rest of us. In them, we find
strength and weakness, honesty and dishonesty, wisdom and
stupidity. All the frills provided them by the taxpayers do not
make them incorruptible or infallible.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton's influence on Capitol Hill and with the public
has been diminished by investigations and revelations, he has not
been found guilty of any crime and he has not been indicted.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of his own party have found it difficult to defend
Clinton and, in the current climate, have found it easy to distance
themselves from him on free trade and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   But as was the case with previous presidents, a rush to judgment
can lead to a false conclusion. Presidents, like the rest of us,
are innocent until proved guilty.

U.S. DROPS THIRD WORLD CUP MATCH, 1-0 TO YUGOSLAVIA  
 (JT )
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NANTES, France _ America lost 1-0 Thursday to Yugoslavia,
bringing down the final curtain on a dismal American performance in
the World Cup, one that brought the United States just one goal in
three matches.
</P>
<P>
   The American showing _ marked by squandered chances, sloppy
passing and the absence of a single player with the authority to
give direction to the team _ underscored the weaknesses that have
beset the United States since its opening match against Germany and
again revealed the gulf separating it from the top teams in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goal scoring opportunities are not easily created at this
level of soccer, and we have to learn to take them,'' Steve
Sampson, the coach, said after the game. ``We showed a lack of
precision in front of goal, an inability to get the ball in the
net.''
</P>
<P>
   After the promising American showings before the World Cup,
including victories over Brazil and Austria, the results here
amounted to a bumpy return to earth. Energetic, busy, somewhat
bewildered, the U.S. players often looked like innocents abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The victory ensured Yugoslavia's ascent to the second round of
the competition, emerging in second place in Group F behind
Germany. The Yugoslav side, which has shown its ability to play
great soccer but was not required to do so Thursday, will face the
Netherlands in a battle of European giants next Monday. Germany,
having clinched victory in the group with a 2-0 win Thursday over
Iran, will play Mexico on the same day in the elimination phase of
the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   This was another game between political rivals, but the
camaraderie and exchanges of flowers that marked America's game
with Iran was absent here. The Serbian-dominated Yugoslav crowd
booed as the Star Spangled Banner was played before the game, and
handshakes between players were perfunctory. There were no flowers.
</P>
<P>
   America surged forward in the opening minutes, and a few slick
exchanges of passes momentarily suggested that the team had turned
a page, throwing off its hesitations and nervousness. Frankie
Hejduk's long, floating cross from the right bemused the Yugoslav
goalkeeper, Ivica Kralj, floating over his flailing hand before
glancing back into play off the far post.
</P>
<P>
   The American momentum was quickly stifled. When a free kick for
a foul on Yugoslavia's star striker, Predrag Mijatovic of Real
Madrid, was awarded in the fourth minute, Sinisa Mihajlovic blasted
a swerving shot from 25 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Friedel, the American goalkeeper, playing his first game of
the tournament, seemed to see the ball late and pawed it away
beyond his left post. But the Yugoslav right back, Slobodan
Komljenovic, was waiting there, and, from an acute angle, headed
the ball into the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were caught ball-watching,'' Friedel said after the game.
He evidently believed he had pushed the ball far enough to be out
of danger.
</P>
<P>
   The United States returned to the attack, but a note of
amateurish desperation was always evident. There was not an
American player on the field prepared to put his foot on the ball,
look up, take stock, and make the intelligent pass. In front of
goal, with reasonable chances, center forward Brian McBride and
midfielder Claudio Reyna repeatedly blasted the ball wide or high.
Clinical finishing was not in America's repertoire here.
</P>
<P>
   Reyna, in whom coach Sampson had placed great faith, was one of
the major disappointments of the tournament, squandering his
evident potential with rushed passes. By the end of Thursday's
match, he looked perhaps the most frustrated player on the pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Two bright spots for the United States were the goalkeeping of
Friedel, who plays for England's Liverpool, and the outstanding
play of David Regis in the heart of the defense. It was their
combined efforts that kept Yugoslavia to a single goal.
</P>
<P>
   Friedel saved brilliantly from Yugoslav forward Savo Milosevic
in the 31st minute, and Regis often intervened as Yugoslav strikers
seemed poised to increase the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Mijatevic, the dangerous Yugoslav striker, was substituted late
in the first half with a slight knee injury. The young Perenica
Ognjenovic, who took his place, missed several chances,
particularly one late in the game when he was put through and had
only Friedel to beat.
</P>
<P>
   America's play grew more scrappy in the second half, and the
team had a chance for a draw. The best scoring opportunity came in
the 80th minute, when Ernie Stewart broke away on the right flank
and crossed well to McBride.
</P>
<P>
   The striker controlled the ball well, but his left-foot shot
from just six yards went straight into Krajl's arms. Two minutes
later, American substitute Predrag Radosavljevik, who started his
career in Yugoslavia, wasted a well-placed free kick, firing over
the bar from the edge of the penalty box.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played a good game,'' captain Thomas Dooley said, ``and we
showed we can play good football. We deserved to draw. The USA team
leaves the World Cup heads held high.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampson was more sober in his assessment. ``The first half
against Germany was our biggest learning experience,'' he said.
``We saw we had to wake up to the level of soccer being played in a
world championship.'' The awakening promises to be long and
painful.

NEW PLANET DETECTED AROUND A STAR 15 LIGHT-YEARS AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The discoveries of planets beyond the solar system, stimulating
renewed speculation of other possible worlds throbbing with life,
are now drawing closer in cosmic terms to the world of their
discoverers.
</P>
<P>
   The latest detection, made this month by American astronomers,
is of a planet about twice the mass of Jupiter that is orbiting the
star Gliese 876, one of the Sun's nearest neighbors at a distance
of only 15 light-years. Previous confirmed extrasolar planets have
been observed at stars from 40 light-years to 80 light-years away.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery at Gliese 876 adds another element of surprise and
surmise to the continuing quest for other planetary systems. The
large object is orbiting a red dwarf star less than one-third the
mass of the Sun.
</P>
<P>
   As the first planet found orbiting a low-mass star, the most
common type of star in the Milky Way galaxy, the discovery
encourages astronomers to think that other planetary systems may be
anything but rare.
</P>
<P>
   They are not confined to Sun-like stars, where at least 11
planets have already been detected in the last three years. No
sooner had astronomers taken a look at a low-mass star than they
found it had a planetary companion. Could it be that planets are a
common phenomenon of stars, large and small?
</P>
<P>
   Time, and improved observation instruments, should yield the
answer. Then it may be possible to compare the solar system with
other families of planets and learn if it is unique in some ways,
typical, or one of many manifestations of nature's variety.
</P>
<P>
   A team of astronomers led by Dr. Geoffrey Marcy, who has made
most of the extrasolar planet discoveries, reported the new finding
on Monday at a symposium of the International Astronomical Union in
Victoria, British Columbia. Within hours, European astronomers sent
a message to a colleague at the symposium saying they had confirmed
the observations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something we really weren't sure we could expect,''
Marcy said in a telephone interview Thursday. ``It is the closest
star around which a planet has been found and by far the
lowest-mass star with a planet. Now we have to consider the
possibility that planets may be common around stars with a wide
range of properties.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen Maran, an astronomer and spokesman for the American
Astronomical Society, said this was one of the most significant
discoveries since the first detection of planets around other
stars, beginning in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``If red dwarfs have planets, there must be a vast number of
planets in the galaxy,'' he said. ``It's also important because red
dwarf stars have very long lives, which means more time for life to
have a chance to evolve on any planets where conditions are
favorable to life.''
</P>
<P>
   Theorists like Dr. Frederic Rasio of the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology were especially intrigued by the orbit of the newly
discovered planet. It completes a trip around the star every 61
days, traveling a much more eccentric orbit than any of the Sun's
planets. Its elongated orbit takes the object, probably a huge
sphere of cold gases, closer to its star than Mercury gets to the
Sun.
</P>
<P>
   The most reasonable explanation for such an orbit, Rasio said in
an interview, is that Gliese 876 has at least two or three large
planetary companions, and their gravitational interactions create a
``dynamical instability.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, in the early stages of the planetary system, one
planet probably got a gravitational kick to the outer fringes of
the star's vicinity, while the one now being observed was kicked in
toward the star itself.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the solar system _ with its planets in more or less
circular orbits _ has enjoyed a more serene history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The solar system is looking more and more like an extremely
unusual planetary system,'' Rasio said. ``It's been stable a very,
very long time, which is probably why we are here.''
</P>
<P>
   The existence of the new planet was first detected at the Lick
Observatory near San Jose, Calif., and then studied in more
revealing detail at the more powerful Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea
in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Marcy is an astronomer at San Francisco State University and the
University of California at Berkeley. The other team members are
Dr. R. Paul Butler of the Anglo-Australian Observatory near Sydney,
Dr. Steven Vogt of the University of California at Santa Cruz and
Dr. Debra Fischer of San Francisco State.
</P>
<P>
   Independent evidence of the new planet's existence was provided
by a European group led by Dr. Xavier Delfosse of the Geneva
Observatory in Switzerland. Their work was done at the
Haute-Provence Observatory in France and the European Southern
Observatory in La Serena, Chile.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As with other recently discovered planets, the object orbiting
Gliese 876 has not been seen or photographed. Its presence is
indicated by the gravitational tug on its parent star, which causes
it to wobble enough to be recorded in spectrographic measurements
of the faint starlight.
</P>
<P>
   In its next issue, the weekly magazine Science News will report
on preliminary calculations by Dr. Didier Saumon, an astrophysicist
at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn., which indicate that
the surface of the presumably gaseous Gliese planet has a
temperature well below the freezing point of water. But in warmer
layers not far below the surface, he said, water could exist as
liquid droplets.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to confirming the Gliese 876 findings, European
astronomers reported evidence this week of planets orbiting three
other stars, HR5568, HR7875 and HR8100, one with a relatively low
mass. Two of them are also relatively nearby, at distances of 20
light-years and 25 light-years. And the astronomers told colleagues
that they may soon be ready to announce two more discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   But the new European observations have yet to be confirmed by
independent research and some scientists questioned the validity of
at least one of the planet candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Marcy said his group was monitoring more than 400 stars within
about 100 light-years of Earth; several show signs of wobbling that
could indicate planetary systems.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stuart Weidenschilling, a theorist at the Planetary Science
Institute in Tucson, Ariz., agreed with Rasio of MIT that the
extremely eccentric orbits of some of these planets indicated that
their stars have at least one other planet that has not been
detected. Soon, astronomers might be studying systems of planets
orbiting other stars.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1995, Dr. Michel Mayor and Dr. Didier Queloz of the
Geneva Observatory made the first discovery of a planet of a normal
star, 51 Pegasi, 40 light-years away. Marcy and Butler weighed in a
few weeks later with confirmation of the 51 Pegasi discovery and
evidence of two other stars with large planets, the first of their
string of successes.
</P>
<P>
   But even with Keck's powerful telescopes, astronomers have
trouble finding planets much smaller than Jupiter, the solar
system's largest planet. NASA is planning to build spacecraft
telescopes that should be able to observe Earth-size planets around
normal stars. &QL;

VOTER TURNOUT LARGE IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ The Northern Ireland peace effort
reached a milestone Thursday as residents of the long-polarized
province turned out in large numbers to elect members of a new
legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Voters chose 108 lawmakers from a field of nearly 300 candidates
from once warring parties to serve in the Northern Ireland
Assembly. The new body will restore local government here for the
first time since the British imposed direct rule in 1972. It will
also set up a structure to meet the elusive goal of power-sharing
between the Catholics and Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   In a pointed symbol of the profoundly changed attitudes in this
province, among those running for office were men who had been some
of the most notorious bombers and killers of the last three
decades, in which more than 3,200 people died in sectarian
violence.
</P>
<P>
   The election was a test of the public's faith in its conversion
to political means to settle its disputes, and of its trust in the
peace settlement that emerged on April 10, after 26 months of
negotiations in Belfast. The accord was endorsed on May 22 by
referendums in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of the Assembly was one step called for in the
accord, which was patterned to give equal weight to the Catholic
longing for eventual unity with Ireland and the Protestant desire
to remain part of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   In a departure from the norm in Northern Irish politics, a
surprisingly low key and conciliatory campaign turned not so much
on conflicts between the province's two principal religious groups
as on disputes and competitions within them.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army,
whose president is Gerry Adams, was looking to gain converts from
the moderate Catholic Social Democratic and Labor Party of John
Hume.
</P>
<P>
   Dissident Protestants, led by the Rev. Ian Paisley, the
78-year-old firebrand, worked to elect enough legislators to bottle
up the work of the Assembly, which will almost certainly have as
its speaker David Trimble, leader of the largest Protestant party,
the Ulster Unionists. Hume, whose party is the second biggest in
the province, will probably be the deputy speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble has warned people that Paisley's purpose is to place as
many of his followers in the Assembly as possible to ``wreck'' it.
Emerging from voting Thursday, Paisley protested that description,
saying, ``The role we play will be as saviors of the union.''
</P>
<P>
   As the campaign progressed, it became apparent that what divided
the electorate was not the traditional religious schism, but
people's views about the validity of the Assembly itself. That, in
turn, has produced an unaccustomed scenario for Northern Ireland,
in which some Catholics and Protestants may end up voting knowingly
for the same objective.
</P>
<P>
   While the progression of the men who once committed savage acts
of terror to a commitment to peaceful negotiations and the ballot
box represents the most dramatic change in the conduct of politics
in Northern Ireland, the transformation of Trimble has in recent
months attracted notice of its own.
</P>
<P>
   The last time that Northern Ireland tried to create a
power-sharing legislature, in 1974, Trimble, then a leader of the
hard-line Ulster Vanguard, led the protests that forced its
collapse. Today he guides a campaign for inclusive government,
giving speeches of populist fervor about reaching across community
divides. Perhaps the best measure of his conversion is the fact
that his old ally, Paisley, has branded him a traitor to
Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly is to meet for the first time next week. But its
order of business will be brief. It will formally select its two
leaders and then move into a ``shadow'' existence in the fall,
creating its rules and committees and selecting the other members
of the 12-member executive that will in effect be Northern
Ireland's government.
</P>
<P>
   That will almost certainly make Adams a minister, an eventuality
that Paisley and hard-line opponents of Trimble in his own party
have continually cited as a reason for opposing the peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   The areas for which the Assembly will be responsible include
agriculture, health, education, the environment and economic
development.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Assembly will not formally be up and running for
an estimated six months, there was an urgency to having the vote
now, so that the process would be completed before the Protestant
marches that have been flash points for violence begin in July.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Assembly's most important early chores will be
creating a cross-border council that will bring members of the
Northern Ireland government together with ministers from the Irish
government. That responds to the desire of most Catholics for
closer ties to Dublin and is the part of the peace settlement that
Paisley and his followers are most eager to stymie.
</P>
<P>
   The businesslike campaign and the orderly vote were conducted in
an atmosphere of unexpected stability. Although a splinter
republican group, the Irish National Liberation Army, succeeded in
bombing the market square of the rural village of Newtonhamilton
near the Irish border on Wednesday, there have been far fewer
outbreaks of violence than had been predicted by Chief Ronnie
Flanagan of the Royal Ulster Constabulary.
</P>
<P>
   All the major paramilitary groups have been maintaining a
cease-fire, and the election Thursday was at once a product of that
achievement and a guarantor of its continuation.
</P>
<P>
   No results will be known until ballot counting begins on Friday.
But the era of formalized cross-community action in Northern
Ireland actually began Thursday because of the nature of the
ballot. Voters were asked to fill in as many as 12 names in order
of preference in a proportional-representation procedure that lets
winning candidates with surplus votes ``transfer'' them to
finishers behind them.

BOHDAN STRUMINSKI, LINGUIST, 68; FOUGHT SOVIET LANGUAGE POLICIES

<TEXT>
<P>
   Bohdan A. Struminski, a linguist and translator who spent three
years in a Polish prison for protesting Soviet language policies in
the Ukraine, died of cancer Tuesday in his home in Arlington, Mass.
He was 68.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Struminski was a specialist in Ukrainian, Polish, and Old
Slavic languages. He was the author of ``Linguistic Interrelations
in Early Rus'' and a translator of scholarly source materials for
the series Early Ukrainian Literature published by Harvard
University and the University of Alberta. He also translated
Czeslaw Milosz's ``The Captive Mind'' from Polish into Ukrainian
and was the author of more than 100 scholarly articles.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Bialystok, Poland, the city for which the bialy,
a round, flat bread roll, is named. He graduated from Warsaw
University, where he also earned a doctorate in philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, he was convicted of anti-Soviet activities for
protesting Soviet language policies in the Ukraine and spent nearly
three years in a Polish prison.
</P>
<P>
   He came to the United States in 1975 and was a visiting
professor at Harvard University until 1979, when he became a
research associate at the Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute,
where he remained until his retirement in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   He contributed to Polish and Ukrainian literary publications
such as ``Kultura'' and ``Suchasnist'' under the pen names A.
Skiwski and D. Bajurs'kyj.
</P>
<P>
   Though he bristled at the term Polish-American, he was
editor-in-chief of Zycie Polonii, a publication of the Eastern
Massachusetts division of the Polish-American Congress. In a story
published in the Polish American Journal on Jan. 1, 1994, he
described himself as a ``Polish citizen residing in America.'' He
denounced the Polish-American title ``because,'' he said, ``it
would suggest that I am only a vestigial Pole, still liking the
polka and kielbasa, but no longer a perfect speaker of Polish, with
all the cultural, historical and psychological consequences
thereof.''
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Kathleen M. Lestition; and a son, Igor of
Poland.

 &HT;    SUPREME COURT STRIKES DOWN PRESIDENTIAL LINE-ITEM AUTHORITY
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Stripping President Clinton of the ability to cut
federal spending with the stroke of a pen, the Supreme Court struck
down his line-item veto authority on Thursday, ruling that the
practice violated Constitutional guarantees of the separation of
power.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-3 decision denies Clinton the ability to eliminate
specific spending provisions in bills that come to his desk, an
option he had exercised 82 times since the line-item veto authority
took effect 18 months ago. The White House immediately decried the
justices' decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am deeply disappointed,'' Clinton, who is visiting China,
said in a prepared statement. ''It deprives the president of a
valuable tool for eliminating waste in the federal budget.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-controlled Congress approved line-item veto
authority for the president in 1996 as part of a larger effort to
reign in three decades of deficit spending. The provision took
effect in January of 1997, but was challenged in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Upholding an earlier finding by federal district court in
Washington D.C., the Supreme Court ruled that the special veto
power gave the president budget authority clearly assigned to the
Congress by the framers of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the justices ruled, taxation without representation
is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ''Money is the instrument of policy, and policy affects the
lives of citizens,'' wrote Justice Anthony Kennedy. ''The
individual loses liberty in a real sense if that instrument is not
subject to traditional constitutional constraints.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, wrote Kennedy, if voters can't force members of
Congress to keep taxes and spending in balance, it's the fault of
the people, not the process.
</P>
<P>
   ''Failure of political will does not justify unconstitutional
remedies,'' Kennedy wrote. ''Abdication of responsibility is not
part of the constitutional design.''
</P>
<P>
   The president may still propose, but not mandate, specific
spending cuts to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   And it is still the White House that sets the agenda for
taxation and spending by submitting its massive annual budget
proposal to Congress, which then uses those recommendations as a
starting point for the yearlong process of debating and
deliberating over taxes and spending.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's ruling shifts the balance of governmental power
slightly from the White House to Capitol Hill, but presidential
scholars differed over how much it would undercut Clinton's
influence on budgetary affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's lost power,'' said James A. Thurber, director of the
Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at the American
University in Washington. ''He's losing the capability to control
the agenda on the Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, said the ruling would have a minimal effect on
White House authority.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's two kinds of power _ one is effective political power
and the other is formal constitutional power,'' said George C.
Edwards III, director of the Center for Presidential Studies at
Texas A&AMP;M University, in College Station, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   For the past century, Edwards said, presidential power, as
determined by the chief executive's ability to capture the national
spotlight and use image and rhetoric to help shape the public
debate, has been growing. That, said Edwards, means far more than
the loss of line-item veto authority. ''I actually don't think it
does very much in the short-term,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, moreover, Clinton used the line-item veto
sparingly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it was ever a very powerful tool,'' said Robert
Bixby, policy director for the Concord Coalition, a Washington
advocacy group dedicated to a balanced federal budget. ''The
president didn't use it much and when he did use it, Congress
frequently overode his vetos.'' Of the 82 items Clinton had vetoed
using the authority, 38 were overridden in Congress _ all affecting
military spending _ and one other was later withdrawn by the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   The 43 remaining vetoes cut $869 million in projected spending
over five years, according to the White House Office of Management
and Budget , not a huge amount of money for a budget that, this
year alone, weighed in at $1.7 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   After three decades of spending more than it takes in, the
federal government is on track this year to raise more revenue
through taxes and fees than it spends. The budget surplus is
expected to top $40 billion, but the savings have resulted chiefly
from six years of lusty economic growth, not from line-item vetos.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the federal books balanced _ and paying off the $5.4
trillion federal debt amassed during a generation of deficit
spending _ will require political discipline, the Supreme Court
ruled, not extra-constitutional measures.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Framers of the Constitution could not command
statesmanship,'' wrote Kennedy. ''They could simply provide
structures from which it might emerge.''
</P>

WINDOWS 98 ROLLOUT MAKES FEW WAVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The introduction of Microsoft Corp.'s new Windows 98 operating
system might be the computer industry's biggest ``non-event'' of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the introduction of Windows 95 three years ago, Microsoft
chose a low-key approach to the Windows 98 rollout, with little
hype and few ads. Meanwhile, industry experts have belittled
Windows 98 as little more than a modest upgrade to Microsoft's
hugely popular Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Microsoft and computer retailers say that
consumers snapped up the new software in its first day on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's biggest computer chain, CompUSA, offered a host of
special bargains to attract customers to the midnight rollout of
Windows 98, including $98 computer systems for the first 10 buyers
in each store.
</P>
<P>
   It worked, according to CompUSA spokeswoman Carol Elfstrom.
``All of our stores had hundreds of people,'' she said. ``Some had
over a thousand. We had a great response. Sales of Windows 98 were
beyond our expectations.'' But Elfstrom refused to provide exact
sales figures.
</P>
<P>
   Later Thursday morning, there were no crowds at the Micro Center
computer store in Cambridge. Instead, a small, steady stream of
customers filed to balloon-decked displays to pick up their copies
of Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Cole, a Boston software consultant, hopes the software will
boost his computer's performance. ``It's supposed to reduce the
boot time and it's supposed to make disk access faster,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cole thought the $89 price tag was too high. ``I think they're
probably charging 20 percent more than they should but...I'm going
to buy it anyway, so I guess they can get away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Matthew Brand, a dump truck mechanic, wanted to
replace the borrowed copy of Windows 95 on his home computer. He
figured $89 was a small price to pay, and he dismissed Microsoft's
critics as sore losers. ``I think other companies are just having a
hard time keeping up with Microsoft,'' he said, ``and that's what
they're complaining about.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft group product manager Rob Bennett said he was pleased
with the first few hours of sales, though he didn't know how many
units were actually sold. ``Even if the product was just half as
successful as Win 95, which was phenomenal, we'd be very
satisfied,'' said Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett will be a happy man, if the industry research firm
Dataquest is on target. Dataquest, of San Jose, Calif., estimates
that 5.5 million units of Windows 98 will be sold this year as
upgrades for machines with Windows 95. That's 37 percent lower than
the 8.8 million upgrade copies that Windows 95 sold in 1995.  &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   But the same study predicts Windows 98 will dominate the market
for operating systems that come pre-installed on new computers.
Dataquest estimates that of 106 million new computers to be sold
this year worldwide, 56.7 million will be equipped with Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   While the initial impact of Windows 98 seemed underwhelming, the
product did get a bump in publicity for an entirely different
reason: the antitrust war between the United States government and
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; On Tuesday, a federal appeals court threw out a lower court
injunction that had barred Microsoft from requiring computer makers
to bundle Microsoft's Internet Explorer Web browser with its
operating system. That issue is central to the Justice Department's
larger antitrust case against the Redmond, Washn. software giant.
The appellate decision made headlines around the world and handed
Microsoft a significant victory in its antitrust battles with the
government.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department could appeal to the Supreme Court to have
the injunction reinstated. But virtually every major computer maker
will now install Windows 98 on their machines, rather than Windows
95, making the injunction meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Microsoft's Bennett said the antitrust dispute may
actually have provided a boost to Windows 98 sales, simply by
keeping the product in the public eye. ``It's not the best kind of
publicity,'' he said, ``but it's certainly helped awareness.''
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 is also the last hurrah for MS-DOS, the operating
system that drove the original IBM Personal Computer in 1981 and
turned Microsoft into a computing superpower. Windows 95 and 98 are
both still largely based upon MS-DOS, an operating system that is
crude by 1990's standards.
</P>

   In the long run, Windows 98 pales in significance to Microsoft's
Windows NT, its high-end product for serious business applications.
Microsoft will build all its future operating systems around
Windows NT, which is designed to run programs more efficiently and
break down less often than MS-DOS and its offspring.
</P>
<P>
   But after the initial buzz wears off, Dataquest analyst Chris
LeTocq predicted that many Windows 95 users won't bother to upgrade
their machines to Windows 98. LeTocq said that Windows 98 would
hold little appeal for business and professional computer users,
because it offers relatively little improvement over Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``If you have Windows 95 and it's working fine and you're not
the sort of person who likes to jump motorcycles over cars, then
there's no reason for you to buy Windows 98,'' said LeTocq. In
addition, he noted that many of the features of Windows 98 can be
added to Windows 95 for free, by downloading software add-ons from
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The real market for Windows 98, LeTocq said, are computer
hobbyists who enjoy tinkering with the latest hardware and
software. ``For those guys,'' he said, ``this is $90 of
entertainment.''

JAPANESE YEN SLIDES AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Japanese yen slipped Thursday to its lowest level against
the dollar since the United States last week shored up Japan's
currency and attempted to bolster its economy.
</P>
<P>
   The yen fell a fourth straight day as world currency traders
grew pessimistic Japan's leaders would take the painful steps
needed to repair a disabled banking system, the only solution to
restoring an economy that contracted at a 5.3 percent annual rate
in the first three months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In betting against the yen, currency traders played a role in
Japan's downward economic spiral: As the yen declines and the stock
market sinks, losses mount at Japan's banks _ heavy investors in
the Nikkei. As losses grow, banks are unable to make loans to
businesses that could recharge the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're in a vicious cycle as the yen depreciates,'' says
Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank.
</P>
<P>
   The yen closed Thursday at 142.19 per US dollar, up 1.14. The
Nikkei barely moved, Thursdayedging up 9 points to close at
15,132.22 _ the market has been flat all year.
</P>
<P>
   The prescription recommended by US Treasury Department officials
in Tokyo last week was clear: Deal immediately, and decisively,
with the financial crisis. But America's desire to impose on Japan
a Texas-style bailout _ closing large, troubled banks _ is no easy
sell to political leaders afraid of taking costly measures before
elections next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese are floating down that great river in Egypt _
`denial,''' says Richard Katz, a reporter in New York for the
Oriental Economist Report, an English-language newsletter on the
region.
</P>
<P>
   There is much to be done.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese government estimates _ economists say
conservatively _ that bad loans total $550 billion. That's more
than double the weight of all bad loans that pulled down financial
institutions in New England and Texas _ and Japan's crisis has
slammed an economy only half as big as the United States'.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Patrick, director of the Center on Japanese Economy and
Business at Columbia University who returned last week from Japan,
predicted that the world will ``start seeing, over the next few
months, additional newsworthy items _ banks merging, going under. I
view that as good news. Unfortunately, most ordinary people will
view it as bad news.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be costly for Japan. The country's bailout could
ultimately amount to nearly 8 percent of gross domestic product.
The US savings and loan crisis, which ultimately cost US taxpayers
more than $130 billion, was about 3 percent of US GDP.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Japan has a trove of riches that can be used to
shore up its banks. The Japanese are vicious savers, stashing $800
billion in one savings bank run by the country's postal service.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever course Japan chooses, economists and US bank regulators
say it will likely require a huge injection by the government into
a banking system that is bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for delay: Politics. ``There's a very strong
resistance to using public funds _ there's a taboo,'' said Steven
Vogel, a Japan specialist and assistant professor of government at
Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Policy makers face myriad dilemmas. For example, a move by the
Bank of Japan to help the economy by reducing already-low interest
rates would further pummel the yen at a time it is trading at
historic lows.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a week after US &UR;  &LR; Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers' trip to Japan, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said he
agreed to set up what is known as a ``bridge bank'' that would
provide government backing during a transition as sick institutions
are restored to healthy ones. The term ``bridge bank'' is even
borrowed from US bailouts.
</P>
<P>
   The reality, say US officials, is that the Japanese government
has hammered out few details of the &UR;  &LR; gargantuan bailout facing
them. The legislature, the Diet, has not yet approved the
establishment of a bridge bank. Now Japan's efforts to clean up the
banks are on hold until after national elections July 12.
Controversial issues are off limits for a Liberal Democratic Party
hoping to win a majority in the upper house.
</P>
<P>
   The government last spring appropriated $30 billion to a trust
fund that can be used to cover depositors or investors in
bank-issued bonds in the event banks fail, and to replenish healthy
banks. By comparison, the 19 banks that form the core of Japan's
financial system lost $28 billion in 1997, according to an estimate
from Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   William Seidman, who chaired the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
during the late-1980s bailouts and has consulted in recent months
to Japan's central bank and Diet members, believes Japan has only
one option: Roll up their sleeves and determine which banks are in
the worst financial condition. Next, he says, the government must
close or sell the sick ones infecting the entire system.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were really just getting into those tough problems,''
says Seidman.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; While some Japanese banks have failed, rumors in Tokyo are
wild that one of the country's biggest banks, the Long Term Credit
Bank of Japan Ltd., is in serious trouble. Bank president Katsunobu
Onogi said at the annual shareholder meeting Thursday he would
consider a merger. Although Onogi did not disclose any names,
possible merger candidates include Nippon Credit Bank.
</P>
<P>
   But a merger with Nippon, a smaller bank in worse condition,
would create a bigger problem, said Tomishi Ishida, a Tokyo bank
analyst. ``It's bad,'' he said.

   SCOTUS-VETO (Washington) _ The Supreme Court rules that the
president cannot cancel individual items of federal spending and
tax breaks approved by Congress because such ``line item vetoes''
circumvent the law-making procedure prescribed by the Constitution.
The ruling is a major blow to Congress and to President Clinton,
who, like many of his predecessors, coveted tax and spending powers
that he did not have. By Robert Pear.
</P>
<P>
   SCOTUS-AIDS (Washington) _ People with HIV infection need not
have any symptoms of disease or obvious impairment to be covered by
the federal law that bars discrimination on the basis of
disability, the Supreme Court rules in a major victory for people
with the virus that causes AIDS. Voting 5-4, the justices agreed
with a federal appeals court's ruling that a woman with
asymptomatic HIV infection, who was refused care in a dentist's
office, met the definition of disability under the Americans with
Disabilities Act. By Linda Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-CLINTON (Xian, China) _ With the pageantry of thundering
drums and clanging gongs, President Clinton is welcomed to China,
the first U.S. president to visit this country in nearly a decade,
and he mildly rebukes critics in Washington who have attacked his
policy of engagement with the Beijing government. By John M.
Broder.
</P>
<P>
   MCDOUGAL _ A federal judge orders the release from prison of
convicted Whitewater figure Susan McDougal because she suffers from
a serious neck and spinal condition.
</P>
<P>
   VATICAN-LUTHERANS (Undated) _ In a decision that brings to a
close a divisive chapter of the Reformation, the Vatican says that
the Roman Catholic Church will sign a joint declaration with the
world's Lutherans that affirms that Catholics and Lutherans share a
basic understanding of how human beings receive salvation. The
document, approved last week by the Lutheran World Federation,
declares that Catholics and Lutherans have common ground to
overcome the issue that split the Western Christian world nearly
500 years ago _ the question of whether ``justification'' comes
solely through faith in God, as Luther held, or whether a person's
good works also play a role, as Catholics emphasized. By Gustav
Niebuhr.
</P>
<P>
   GM-STRIKE (Flint, Mich.) _ Like a large stone thrown in a pond,
the strikes at two General Motors' parts factories are producing
economic effects that are slowly rippling out across North America.
The first effects were felt immediately in this town when the
strike began, because GM accounts for more than half the employment
and taxes here. When 3,400 workers went on strike at a metal parts
stamping factory here on June 5, nearby restaurants lost half their
business immediately, while the pool table and bar stools at the
pub across the street have been deserted for the last three weeks.
The next ripples came over the last two weeks as the company has
closed 26 of its 29 assembly plants in North America and curtailed
production at nearly 100 parts factories. Now the effects are
reaching across the country, into communities and states where the
auto industry has been less visible than here in the industrial
Midwest. By Keith Bradsher.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-NEW-PLANETS (Undated) _ The discoveries of planets beyond
the solar system, stimulating renewed speculation of other possible
worlds throbbing with life, are now drawing closer in cosmic terms
to the world of their discoverers. The latest detection, made this
month by American astronomers, is of a planet about twice the mass
of Jupiter orbiting the star Gliese 876, one of the Sun's nearest
neighbors at a distance of only 15 light-years away. Previous
confirmed extrasolar planets have been observed at stars 40 to 80
light-years away. By John Noble Wilford. (MOVED)
</P>
<P>
   BBO-NY-YANKS-METS (New York) _ If the heavens cooperate, two
teams will gather on a swath of Queens County grass to demonstrate
how the game of baseball has particularly blessed New York City
this year with talent and character. An umpire will shout a
familiar demand, a Mets pitcher will fire a baseball to a Yankees
batter, and all will be right in one corner of an ever-churning
metropolis. By Dan Barry.

GERMANY DEFEATS IRAN, 2-0, MOVES INTO SECOND-ROUND MATCH WITH
MEXICO  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTPELLIER, France _ On a patch of worn grass leading to La
Mosson Stadium, between two of the many police checkpoints in
Montpellier Thursday, a group of Germans sat with a handwritten
sign in French by their feet.
</P>
<P>
   The sign read, ``Sorry for Lens.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day Germany clinched first place in Group F with a 2-0
victory over Iran, there were many poignant gestures of regret from
German fans and officials for the French policeman, Daniel Nivel,
who was beaten by German hooligans in Lens, an attack that left him
in a coma after Germany's match against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   There were messages of apology for the attack on display in the
stands and on the official World Cup web site. German Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel visited Montpellier's famous square, la Place
de la Comedie, to express his regret over the incident and his
support of French police, who were out in force throughout this
peaceful city Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   One German tabloid newspaper, the same that published graphic
photos of the beating, has opened an account to receive donations
for Nivel's family, and a poll conducted by German television
network RTL found that 62 percent of its viewers were in favor of
the German team giving the Nivel family its bonus money from the
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   In case of victory, that bonus would be approximately $3
million, but for now all that is certain is that Germany is in the
World Cup second round for the 12th consecutive time. It got there
by doing more than necessary _ it only needed a draw Thursday night
_ but by doing less than some of its German critics would like to
see. For the second consecutive match, it played a mediocre first
half, struggling with its transition from defense to attack, but
the Germans quickly found their rhythm in the second half: getting
goals on headers from Oliver Bierhoff in the 50th minute and
captain Jurgen Klinsmann in the 57th.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not the perfect team, but I haven't seen the perfect
team yet in this World Cup,'' said Klinsmann, one of eight German
starters over 30. ``We can improve, and we will improve.''
</P>
<P>
   The Germans, who will face Mexico in the second round in
Montpellier, finished with seven points in the group, taking first
place over Yugoslavia on goal differential. The Iranians finished
third with three points: all earned by the emotional 2-1 victory
over the United States that made their World Cup a success.''We
were a little tired tonight after running so much against the
Americans,' said Iranian defender Mohammed Khakpour. ``But the
Germans were the best team we played here.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Thursday broadly affirmed the
rights of clients to take to their graves their consultations with
lawyers. The ruling was a legal setback for the Whitewater
independent counsel, who was seeking the notes of the lawyer who
had represented Vincent Foster, the deputy White House counsel who
committed suicide nearly five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the 6-3 decision was an important victory for a prominent
array of lawyer organizations and groups representing the
terminally ill and psychiatrists. They had argued that any erosion
of the lawyer-client privilege would have a devastating impact on
the relationship between lawyers and their clients, leaving hollow
a well-grounded doctrine of confidentiality that is the cornerstone
of modern law practice because it provides the fundamental
incentive for clients to be speak candidly with their lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The justices ruled that three pages of notes taken by Foster's
lawyer, James Hamilton, at a meeting of the two did not lose its
protection under the lawyer-client privilege when Foster died nine
days later.
</P>
<P>
   In issuing a subpoena for the notes, Starr had maintained that
Foster's death extinguished the privilege. He had claimed that the
lawyer's notes were central to the inquiry into the circumstances
of Foster's death and the dismissal of the staff of the White House
travel office in 1993, an event which, by all accounts, had
contributed to Foster's deepening depression.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton had argued that the notes of his consultation with
Foster were protected, even posthumously, by the privilege.
Thursday the high court, reversing a federal appeals court
decision, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been generally, if not universally, accepted, for well
over a century, that the attorney-client privilege survives the
death of the client in a case such as this,'' Chief Justice William
Rehnquist wrote for the court. ``While the arguments against the
survival of the privilege are by no means frivolous, they are based
in large part on speculation _ thoughtful speculation, but
speculation nonetheless _ as to whether posthumous termination of
the privilege would diminish a client's willingness to confide in
an attorney.''
</P>
<P>
   The justices rejected Starr's claim that any effect on the
client-lawyer relationship would be minimal. Starr had argued that
when clients seek advice from lawyers, they do not give much
thought to what happens after they die.
</P>
<P>
   But the court said many clients have an abiding interest in
posthumously preserving their reputations and protecting their
survivors from the intrusions of investigators.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Knowing that communications will remain confidential even
after death encourages the client to communicate fully and frankly
with counsel,'' the court said. ``While the fear of disclosure, and
the consequent withholding of information from counsel, may be
reduced if disclosure is limited to posthumous disclosure in a
criminal context, it seems unreasonable to assume that it vanishes
altogether. Clients may be concerned about reputation, civil
liability, or possible harm to friends or family. Posthumous
disclosure of such communications may be as feared as disclosure
during the client's lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the justices speculated, it was ``quite plausible that
Foster, perhaps already contemplating suicide, may not have sought
legal advice from Hamilton if he had not been assured the
conversation was privileged.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr, who has repeatedly criticized the administration for
invoking a variety of privileges to limit testimony in his inquiry,
on Thursday issued a brief statement that expressed disappointment
in the outcome of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue has obviously proved to be of considerable
difficulty, as the divided opinions of the Supreme Court and the
Court of Appeals reveal,'' he said. ``In all events, we continue to
pursue our investigation as thoroughly and expeditiously as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to know what impact the decision in the case
will have on the long-running inquiry by Starr because it will
probably never be known whether Hamilton's notes contained anything
useful to investigators. While Foster was a close confidant of
President Clinton and a former law partner of Hillary Rodham
Clinton, Starr has won other legal fights over privilege issues
only to obtain relatively unimportant evidence.
</P>
<P>
   But as a matter of law, the ruling Thursday was a decisive
defeat for Starr, who had asked the court to put the case on a fast
track.
</P>
<P>
   Even the court's three dissenters _ Justices Sandra Day
O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas _ refused to go as far
as Starr had sought in his argument that in criminal cases, the
privilege dies with the client.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the dissenting justices proposed that there be a new and
narrow exception to the privilege after death allowing for a lawyer
to turn over material to criminal investigators only in exceptional
circumstances and when the information is not generally available
elsewhere. They cited the compelling example of when a client,
before dying, confesses to a crime for which another person is
being tried.
</P>
<P>
   In a footnote, the majority dismissed the dissent's concerns
about such cases, saying that issue was not squarely before the
court in the case decided Thursday, Swidler &AMP; Berlin vs. United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The court refused to extend the main exception to the
lawyer-client privilege after the death of a client _ in disputes
between heirs. In those cases, most state courts have found that
the disclosure of confidences is permissible because it furthers
the client's intent in disposing of an estate.
</P>
<P>
   But the court declined to adopt the argument by Starr that that
exception to the privilege should be expanded to include criminal
inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason to suppose as a general matter that grand
jury testimony about confidential communications furthers the
client's intent,'' the court said.
</P>
<P>
   The case began in 1995, when a federal grand jury, at the
request of Starr, issued a subpoena to Hamilton for the notes. A
district court judge, after privately examining the notes,
concluded that they were protected by the lawyer-client privilege.
Last year a divided three-judge panel of the District of Columbia
U.S. Court of Appeals reversed, finding that the need of the
investigators for the notes outweighed the policy reasons behind
confidentiality.

US LOSES, BUT SALVAGES SOME PRIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   NANTES, France _ The United States salvaged some pride and
Yugoslavia concentrated on self-preservation Thursday night. The
Yugoslavs took a 1-0 victory, coasting after an early goal by
Slobodan Komljenovic, but they were unable to turn this World Cup
match into a goalfest in an effort to overtake Germany for first
place in Group F.
</P>
<P>
   This translated into the smallest of accomplishments for the US,
which was eliminated by Iran Sunday and concluded the tournament
without a point and with one goal, its lowest scoring total since
the 1934 finals in Italy. Yugoslavia had hoped to avoid a
second-round meeting with Holland but will meet the Group E winner
in Toulouse Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The US had virtually nothing at stake, and the atmosphere was
much calmer in this city than it was in Lyon, site of Sunday's
match against Iran. But the US played conservatively in a 3-6-1
formation, demonstrating little creativity or inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   A US victory would have been as believable as a science fiction
work by Nantes's most famous author, Jules Verne. But it nearly
scored in the opening seconds as a Frankie Hejduk cross skimmed the
far post.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia appeared dangerous with a high-powered midfield and
Real Madrid striker Pedrag Mijatovic. But Mijatovic suffered a leg
injury and departed in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew from the outset this would be a very important
match,'' Yugoslav coach Slobodan Santrac said. ``We knew the US had
weaknesses and we were hoping to capitalize on them. Unfortunately,
we were unable to when we had chances for goals in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``The US played three strong matches. They didn't get the
results they hoped to get, but this is a team which will continue
to progress.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslavs put the game away early as Mijatovic was held by
Mike Burns 35 yards from the goal and Egyptian referee Gamal
Ghandour awarded a free kick. Sinisa Mihajlovic, whose free kick
provided the difference in an opening victory over Iran, drilled a
shot to goalkeeper Brad Friedel's left. Friedel's punch went
directly toward the far post, where Komljenovic neatly headed past
Thomas Dooley.
</P>
<P>
   The US nearly scored in the first 25 seconds when Hejduk's cross
surprised goalkeeper Ivica Kralj and glanced off the far post.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Americans' chances came after the first goal, the
best after a Brian McBride cross was sent just wide of the far post
by Joe-Max Moore in the 31st minute. McBride departed after a clash
with Slavisa Jokanovic and returned two minutes later with his head
bandaged.
</P>
<P>
   Mijatovic went toward the bench in the 31st minute and might
have cost the Yugoslavs a goal as he left the exact place where
Milosevic's shot rebounded.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia appeared content to counterattack and remained
dangerous with Mijatovic's replacement, Perica Ognjenovic, who
combined well with Milosevic and Stankovic. But the Yugoslavs
struggled to find a midfield rhythm as Dragan Stojkovic was
repeatedly confronted by US players. Vladimir Jugovic supported
Stojkovic and put the US under pressure. Claudio Reyna retreated
into defense to break up a Stankovic counter late in the half, and
Burns got the best of a collision with Stankovic in the penalty
area.
</P>
<P>
   Preki entered 10 minutes into the second half in place of Moore
but had little influence on the game until late. Cobi Jones was
fouled by Jugovic, and Preki curled a 25-yard free kick just over
the bar in the 38th minute. Eric Wynalda and Marcelo Balboa, among
the veterans excluded from most of the action in the World Cup by
coach Steve Sampson, entered late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We proved we can play very good soccer against very good
teams,'' Sampson said. ``Again, our inability to finish was
crucial. Our lack of precision must be improved on as a national
team if we expect to get any kind of results in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will of course remember the quality of the opposition, what
I think was outstanding organization, also the tremendous fan
support of the Americans who traveled to France, the quality of
football we played at times, the numerous chances against Iran, and
of course, the missed chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we have already learned a lot from this. The first
half against Germany will be probably the greatest learning
experience for us. We had to very quickly learn to wake up to the
level of soccer at this level.''

WORKPLACE QUESTIONS FOR THE '90S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Two questions: Should any worker be exempt from
adapting to change?
</P>
<P>
   Change has a spot right up there with death and taxes. It is a
constant that cuts across all workplaces. It comes in new
technology, corporate reorganization, personnel realignment and
even forces of nature. Whatever the cause, it comes.
</P>
<P>
   So, should members of a union, who entered a workforce under one
set of agreements and expectations, be exempt from change when
their employer seeks to alter their labor agreement?
</P>
<P>
   Should a mentally retarded woman, who entered a workforce to do
only a single task, be exempt from change when her employer
restructures job definitions so that all workers must handle more
than one task?
</P>
<P>
   These are real questions. General Motors knows. It's dealing
with both of them in the arenas of law and public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, it's easy to say to those resisting change: Get
over it. Get with it. Only those who change will survive under the
new rules of global competition and investor expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But there's always another hand.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any reason for collective bargaining to exist any more,
if not for its ability to fulfill the quality-of-work expectations
of those it represents?
</P>
<P>
   Is there any reason for the Americans with Disabilities Act to
exist, if not for its ability to protect the quality-of-work
expectations of those it represents?
</P>
<P>
   These, too, are real questions. The answers aren't easy,
especially when what seems economically expedient to employers
clashes with the expectations of employees and others. It often
takes time and pain to bring to put those unaligned expectations in
sync.
</P>
<P>
   Will the United Auto Workers prevail in obtaining job security
guarantees?
</P>
<P>
   Will Denise Anderson win the right to return to a line job that
no longer exists?
</P>
<P>
   We'll wait for answers, knowing that unaligned expectations
sometimes never align.
</P>
<P>
   Should any worker stay in a job he or she hates?
</P>
<P>
   I happened to pass by two workers in conversation, one of whom
was saying this, ``I hate my job as much today as I did
yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not said in jest. It was said in the tone someone uses to
say, ``My cancer is not yet in remission.''
</P>
<P>
   The speaker was a stranger, but I wasn't sure whether I wanted
to slap him or hug him.
</P>
<P>
   What we do for a living takes up too much of our time and is too
much a part of our identity _ like it or not _ to hate it that
much.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a time of bread lines and soup kitchens. Jobs are
begging for people, not the other way around. Yes, there are people
who cannot find the job they want. Yes, a prolonged job search is
financially and emotionally painful.
</P>
<P>
   But there are alternatives. Maybe not the dream job, the perfect
job, the one equal to your experience and income expectations. But
skills can be adapted and used in many different ways. There are
temporary solutions and even long-range ones that are better, much
better, than the daily agony of dragging yourself to and through a
job you hate.
</P>
<P>
   Job security is a great thing. But, face it, it doesn't exist
any more for most people. Don't stay in a job just because you have
it. Security never outweighs misery.
</P>

GM STRIKE IN FLINT STARTING TO RIPPLE THROUGH THE ECONOMY

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. _ Strikes at two General Motors parts factories
here, which started as local disputes over work hours and equipment
investments, are producing economic effects that are slowly
rippling out across North America.
</P>
<P>
   The first effects were felt in Flint as soon as the strike
began, because GM accounts for more than half the employment and
taxes here. When 3,400 workers went on strike at a metal parts
stamping factory on June 5, nearby restaurants lost half their
business immediately, and the pool table and bar stools at the pub
across the street have been deserted for the last three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The next ripples came over the last two weeks as GM has closed
26 of its 29 assembly plants in North America and curtailed
production at nearly 100 parts factories. These factories have
temporarily laid off 147,900 production workers, including 10,400
in Canada and 32,000 in Mexico, which is approaching half the
company's North American work force.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department announced Thursday that first-time claims
for unemployment jumped 10.3 percent last week in the United
States, the first of many economic indicators likely to reflect the
strike's effects.
</P>
<P>
   Now the effects are reaching across the country, into
communities and states where the auto industry has been less
visible than here in the industrial Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ITT Industries Inc. has laid off 1,200 workers at a
windshield-wiper factory in Rochester, N.Y. Lear Corp. has laid off
2,800 employees at car-seat factories from Delaware to Texas. And
Harvard Industries Inc. has laid off 900 of the 1,250 workers at
its factories in Churchill, Tenn., Wytheville, Va., and Newfields,
N.H.
</P>
<P>
   The GM strikes have now surpassed the production lost in the
strikes two years ago that began at brake-making plants in Dayton,
Ohio, and have become the costliest labor dispute in the auto
industry since a two-month national strike against GM in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Private economists are beginning to shave back their estimates
of the annualized growth rate of the nation's economic output
during the second quarter. Before the strike, the consensus was
that the economy would expand at about a 3 percent annual rate, but
experts are now expecting that to be more like 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The economy has rebounded sharply after previous GM strikes, as
auto workers put in overtime to make up for lost production, and
the economy is likely to rebound this time, too, government and
private economists said. Economic indicators ``do bounce back the
following quarter'' after GM strikes, said Lee Price, the Commerce
Department's chief economist.
</P>
<P>
   But the strikes are already beginning to cause hardship now for
some, although many companies are trying to soften the blow in an
effort to keep skilled workers at a time of low unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Autoliv ASP Inc. has furloughed nearly 450 employees at air-bag
factories around Salt Lake City this week. Nikki Vaughn, 20, an
assembly line worker who is expecting a baby in September,
volunteered for the furlough rather than accept a job on another,
unfamiliar Autoliv assembly line making parts for another
automaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't think it would affect us, but now it has,'' said Ms.
Vaughn, adding that she would save money by shortening a planned
vacation this summer.
</P>
<P>
   With growing signs that the strike will not be settled during
GM's annual summer shutdown in the first two weeks of July _ and
with the likelihood that it will take two or three weeks for
factories to reopen after a settlement _ economists are also
reconsidering their growth forecasts for the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Ballew, the Federal Reserve's expert on the auto industry
for many years and now the chief economist at J.D. Power and
Associates, a consulting firm, said that economic growth could drop
by as much as 0.7 percent in the third quarter if the strike lasts
into August, as leaders of the United Auto Workers union threatened
this week.
</P>
<P>
   The lost production might not be recouped until the end of the
first quarter of next year, because it is difficult to make up for
lost production during the autumn, when new models are being
introduced, he added.
</P>
<P>
   William Strauss, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank
of Chicago, said that while the strike's effects might be
temporary, it could have a slight but longer-lasting effect to
increase inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Price wars and discount coupons, spurred by a glut of late-model
used cars and the dollar's strength in currency markets (making
imported cars and car parts cheaper), have pushed down new-vehicle
prices by nine-tenths of a percent in the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   This has helped to restrain inflation because new-car prices
make up 5.1 percent of the Consumer Price Index. GM still holds
nearly a third of the U.S. car market, but as it runs low on cars,
GM is likely to offer fewer discounts and other automakers may
follow suit, Strauss said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a likely scenario that we're going to have less
competition, which means higher prices,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are some signs that the layoffs may be plateauing now, at
least at GM. After three weeks of laying off thousands of workers
each day, GM laid of 1,500 Thursday, mostly auto parts workers in
the United States and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   GM executives asked assembly plant managers on Wednesday morning
to send home any ``nonessential'' maintenance workers at shuttered
factories and turn off the power to the machinery to save money on
utility bills. But GM officials said Thursday that this would
result in very few layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Commerce Department, the Dayton strike trimmed
three-tenths of a percentage point from the annualized rate of
economic growth in the first quarter of 1996. Growth in that
quarter was 1.8 percent, but the economy recovered with 6 percent
growth during the second quarter of that year.
</P>
<P>
   The 1970 strike had a greater effect. The annualized rate of
economic growth actually dropped 3.9 percent in the fourth quarter,
when the strike occurred, but then bounced back with an 11.3
percent gain in the first quarter of 1971.
</P>
<P>
   The 9,200 striking workers are collecting $150 a week in
benefits from the UAW. Laid-off workers are generally eligible for
unemployment benefits of $250 or $300 per month, depending on the
state. GM said Wednesday that it would try to block benefits for
laid-off UAW workers, but an attempt in 1996 by GM to do so met
with little success.
</P>
<P>
   The current strikes could have a longer-term economic effect if
they result in GM closing some of its chronically unprofitable
small-car factories in the United States and investing overseas
instead.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Hackworth, GM's group vice president for North American
cars, said last week that GM would reconsider its investment plans
in the United States if the UAW did not agree to improve
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   GM's after-tax losses from the current strikes are approaching
$1 billion, for which the company is not insured. Through Friday,
GM will have lost the production of roughly 230,000 vehicles,
compared with 180,000 vehicles lost during the Dayton strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of the current GM strike would be even worse were it
not for the nation's strong economy, which is making it easier for
laid-off workers to find new jobs. Trucking companies are having a
very hard time finding drivers, for example, and have been taking
out newspaper advertisements and sending recruiters to Flint.
</P>
<P>
   GM is the nation's largest company and its North American
operations account for about 1.5 percent of the nation's economic
output, according to the Commerce Department.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the drivers in this area don't have as much to do
because of the strike,'' said Bill Davis, a recruiter for Certified
Transport LLC, who drove five hours from Indianapolis on Thursday
morning to hire two drivers who responded to the trucking company's
ads.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies are trying to cushion the strike's effects on
their workers so as to hold on to them. Many of Autoliv's workers
reluctantly volunteered for their furloughs as an unpaid summer
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitol Coney Island Family Restaurant, a 24-hour eatery
near one of the Flint factories, has allowed workers to leave early
but has not laid off anyone even though business is off by a
quarter in the restaurant and three-quarters at the take-out
window.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to find people,'' said Philip Kosman, the
restaurant's owner.
</P>
<P>
   Managers of other businesses are more worried. Gerry Tighe, the
general counsel of Harvard Industries, said that he wished the
White House would take a bigger role in seeking to end the strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have thought we might have some attention from the
bully pulpit, that some pressure should be brought to bear on
General Motors and the UAW,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has expressed concern about the strike, but
has said that the company and the union should settle their
disagreements through collective bargaining. &QL;

A DELICACY AMID THORNS AND PESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: People long familiar with that piece of country cannot
remember a year when the blackberries began coming ripe so soon, or
the canes were heavier with fruit.
</P>
<P>
   By middle June, a full two weeks early, the first were ready for
picking. Most still were red, so you had to search for the ripe
ones. But they were there low among the foliage _ plump and glossy
black, though a bit tart yet.
</P>
<P>
   They'll be sweeter this coming weekend. And sweeter still a bit
deeper into July. By then, nearly all will be mature, and the trick
in gathering will be to make the hand deliver them to the pail, not
to the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   I know of no gift that nature gives in more dependable
abundance. Only in a year when a late spring frost spoils the
blooming _ last year was such a one _ does the berry harvest fail.
And even then, there's usually some sheltered place whose
microclimate has preserved a few _ enough for a pie or a cobbler or
two.
</P>
<P>
   The gift is not entirely free, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Ticks and chiggers, in their inestimable numbers, await the
picker. When I was small, my mother dusted sulfur in my socks and
inside my trousers at the beltline to keep those pests away.
</P>
<P>
   It was useless. Then as now, no preparation known to man would
turn them, the chiggers especially. And it's said one also ought to
be careful of snakes in a blackberry thicket, though I've never met
one there.
</P>
<P>
   It's the clawing thorns that deliver the worst punishment. No
matter how cautiously you work, they catch the hand and lance
through sleeve and trouser leg. The swollen sun beats down, sending
salty rivulets of perspiration into the scratches.
</P>
<P>
   I can remember more than once getting so snagged and entangled
among the canes that there seemed no hope of ever getting loose
again.
</P>
<P>
   And I was tempted to cry out to my fellow pickers just to go on
and leave me, the way some northern tribes abandon their infirm
alone on the ice, to await the mercy of predators.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, in that country there are no predators of
sufficient size or savagery to finish the job.
</P>
<P>
   So there was nothing for it but to make my way to freedom in the
best possible way, whimpering and using what I believe is termed
/{adult/} language. And trying not to drop the part-full pail of
berries already picked.
</P>
<P>
   We understand perfectly the misery that waits, and yet we look
forward to this weekend and the next several of gathering.
</P>
<P>
   One fine year my daughter and her friend and I came home from
the country with enough berries to bake a dozen pies, or it could
have been more. Maybe 20. I think there may still be one or two in
the freezer.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, from time to time, we would take one out and thaw it
for the birthday of someone we knew, or some other special
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   By then, naturally, our wounds and welts had healed, the scars
had all but disappeared, so there was nothing to suggest the price
of suffering we'd paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tasty,'' the people would say.
</P>
<P>
   Only that. Then the conversation would pass on to something
else.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't want to sound bitter about it. But since then we've
gotten choosier about whom we share our berries with. What possible
joy can there be in giving, if the beneficiary doesn't understand
exactly how much your kindness cost?

BUHL HOPING FOR ANOTHER COMEBACK WIN IN NEW ENGLAND 200 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robbie Buhl reflected on his first career Indy Racing League
triumph in last year's Pennzoil 200 at New Hampshire International
Speedway and remembered that it all happened, as things often do in
a feverish Indy car race, suddenly and dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   With three laps to go, Buhl inherited the lead from Eddie
Cheever but narrowly averted a rear-end collision when Cheever's
gearbox failed. Then, in another bit of last-lap drama, Buhl held
off a furious charge by runner-up Vincenzo Sospiri by .064 seconds,
the closest margin in IRL history.
</P>
<P>
   A 1986 graduate of New England College in Henniker, N.H., Buhl
could not think of a better backdrop for his first race back behind
the wheel of his Team Menard car after he suffered a severe
concussion during a test session at Pikes Peak, Colo., and was
sidelined for two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It couldn't have been scripted any better, especially with the
whole scenario and all that,'' he said during a media luncheon
Thursday at the Original Sports Saloon. ``That's what made it
pretty sweet _ that whole scenario of what had happened coming into
that race, with me spending the better time of my life around here
(in college) and racing up at that track when I paid 35 bucks on a

   Buhl, a 34-year-old native of Grosse Point, Mich., would like
nothing more than to duplicate his feat in Sunday's Pep Boys IRL
event, the New England 200, at NHIS. He will enter the race 15th in
the points standings with 58 after finishing only half of the four
races he's entered, including the last at Texas Motor Speedway,
where he recorded a season-best sixth place in the True Value 500K
June 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``To come back and win that event last year, that was as
gratifying as anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Buhl sported a new goatee and a renewed sense of
determination. But all he wanted, really, was to prove he was back.
Good as new. ``The reason I did (grow the goatee) last year was
that I was trying to do anything to confuse the doctors into
letting me drive,'' said Buhl, who arrived in Boston Thursday
sporting a goatee.
</P>
<P>
   Superstitious, Robbie?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not really. I'm not superstitious. I don't deal with
superstitions. The only routine I have is ... OK, the rabbit's
foot, the same gloves I've had since '81 ...'' he joked. ``Really,
the only thing I do is I get in a race car from the lefthand side.
It's not a superstition. I just always get in on the lefthand
side.''
</P>
<P>
   Buhl says he will not retrace his steps from last year, but he
will make a stop today at Children's Hospital as part of his
``Racing for Kids'' program. Still, nothing would change Buhl's
luck like another victory at NHIS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say I'm definitely as hungry as I was last year from
the standpoint that things have just not gone well for us this
year,'' he said. ``We've just had some unforeseen things happen to
us. So we really need a win to help us erase that and help us with
our momentum for the rest of the year.''

BUST OF MISSOURI CONGRESSMAN UNVEILED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bill Emerson, the late congressman, was just a
teenager, not even old enough yet to drive, when he first carved
out a small place for himself on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1953, and he was fresh from Hillsboro, Mo., a wide-eyed
15-year-old with a love of history, roaming the marble halls as a
congressional page.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, 45 years later, Emerson's place in the
congressional firmament became permanently fixed.
</P>
<P>
   In a crowded ceremony in the Capitol's Statuary Hall, Emerson's
wife, friends and former colleagues unveiled a bronze bust of the
Missouri Republican that will be placed at the House's Page School
in the Library of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of anything that's more perfect than for this
bust to reside at the entrance to the page school so that pages
will see that they too, can be anything they want to be,'' said
Rep. Jo Ann Emerson, who succeeded her husband as Missouri's 8th
District representative after his death of cancer two years ago
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Emerson, elected in 1980, was a conservative Republican who
built a reputation for pragmatism. While he championed issues that
affected Missouri, such as agriculture and public works, he also
cast a wider net to become a leading Capitol Hill voice on hunger
and congressional reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of his great strengths was that he was very unassuming,
very workmanlike,'' said House Speaker Newt Gingrich. ``He didn't
take himself seriously. He was able to cut through the baloney.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of any person who kept the institution closer to
his heart,'' said Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas. Roberts served with
Emerson in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The inspiration for a lasting memorial to Emerson came the day
of his funeral when Bill Coffield, Emerson's executive assistant,
and James Sharp, a friend from college, got together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got to chatting, and Jim said what would really be a neat
thing, and of course, Bill would never ask for it, but to have a
bust of him somewhere special,'' Coffield said.
</P>
<P>
   So they formed a nonprofit group, raised money and hired
sculptor Michael Curtis, of Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   And Emerson Hall at the page school, so named after the
congressman just after his death, seemed to be the most fitting
place.
</P>
<P>
   As a teenager, Emerson wrote to every member of the House and
Senate but got little encouragement in his request to become a
page, his wife recalled. But in Washington for the inauguration of
President Eisenhower in 1953 _ a trip promised to him by his
grandfather _ Emerson stopped by the office of his local
congressman, Thomas Curtis.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're Billy Emerson from Hillsboro, Missouri.?'' Curtis'
receptionist said to him, Jo Ann Emerson recounted. ``We have been
looking all over for you!''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis hired the future congressman on the spot. His mother had
to send him his clothes by mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was truly a child of Congress,'' said Rep. Ike Skelton, a
Missouri Democrat.

EXCERPTS FROM HIGH COURT OPINIONS IN LAWYER-CLIENT PRIVILEGE CASE

   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from Thursday's Supreme
Court opinion that the lawyer-client privilege survives the death
of the client. The opinion in the case, Swidler &AMP; Berlin and James
Hamilton vs. United States, was written by Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, Anthony M.
Kennedy, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G.
Breyer. A dissenting opinion, which is also excerpted below, was
filed by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and joined by Justices Antonin
Scalia and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   FROM THE DECISION
</P>
<P>
   By Justice Rehnquist
</P>
<P>
   This dispute arises out of an investigation conducted by the
office of the independent counsel into whether various individuals
made false statements, obstructed justice, or committed other
crimes during investigations of the 1993 dismissal of employees
from the White House travel office. Vincent W. Foster Jr. was
deputy White House counsel when the firings occurred. In July 1993,
Foster met with petitioner James Hamilton, an attorney at
petitioner Swidler Berlin, to seek legal representation concerning
possible Congressional or other investigations of the firings.
During a two-hour meeting, Hamilton took three pages of handwritten
notes. One of the first entries in the notes is the word
``Privileged.'' Nine days later, Foster committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1995, a Federal grand jury, at the request of the
independent counsel, issued subpoenas to petitioners Hamilton and
Swidler Berlin for, inter alia, Hamilton's handwritten notes of his
meeting with Foster. Petitioners filed a motion to quash, arguing
that the notes were protected by the attorney-client privilege and
by the work product privilege. The District Court, after examining
the notes in camera, concluded they were protected from disclosure
by both doctrines and denied enforcement of the subpoenas.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
reversed.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney-client privilege is one of the oldest recognized
privileges for confidential communications. The privilege is
intended to encourage ``full and frank communication between
attorneys and their clients and thereby promote broader public
interests in the observance of law and the administration of
justice.'' The issue presented here is the scope of that privilege;
more particularly, the extent to which the privilege survives the
death of the client. Our interpretation of the privilege's scope is
guided by ``the principles of the common law as interpreted by the
courts in the light of reason and experience.'' Federal Rules of
Evidence 501.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel argues that the attorney-client
privilege should not prevent disclosure of confidential
communications where the client has died and the information is
relevant to a criminal proceeding. There is some authority for this
position. One state appellate court and the Court of Appeals below
have held the privilege may be subject to posthumous exceptions in
certain circumstances. But other than these two decisions, cases
addressing the existence of the privilege after death most
involving the testamentary exception uniformly presume the
privilege survives, even if they do not so hold. Such testamentary
exception cases consistently presume the privilege survives.
</P>
<P>
   The great body of this case law supports, either by holding or
considered dicta, the position that the privilege does survive in a
case such as the present one. Given the language of Rule 501, at
the very least the burden is on the independent counsel to show
that ``reason and experience'' require a departure from this rule.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel contends that the testamentary exception
supports the posthumous termination of the privilege because in
practice most cases have refused to apply the privilege
posthumously. He further argues that the exception reflects a
policy judgment that the interest in settling estates outweighs any
posthumous interest in confidentiality. He then reasons by analogy
that in criminal proceedings, the interest in determining whether a
crime has been committed should trump client confidentiality,
particularly since the financial interests of the estate are not at
stake.
</P>
<P>
   But the independent counsel's interpretation simply does not
square with the case law's implicit acceptance of the privilege's
survival and with the treatment of testamentary disclosure as an
``exception'' or an implied ``waiver.'' And the premise of his
analogy is incorrect, since cases consistently recognize that the
rationale for the testamentary exception is that it furthers the
client's intent. There is no reason to suppose as a general matter
that grand jury testimony about confidential communications
furthers the client's intent.
</P>
<P>
   We think there are weighty reasons that counsel in favor of
posthumous application. Knowing that communications will remain
confidential even after death encourages the client to communicate
fully and frankly with counsel. While the fear of disclosure, and
the consequent withholding of information from counsel, may be
reduced if disclosure is limited to posthumous disclosure in a
criminal context, it seems unreasonable to assume that it vanishes
altogether. Clients may be concerned about reputation, civil
liability, or possible harm to friends or family. Posthumous
disclosure of such communications may be as feared as disclosure
during the client's lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel suggests, however, that his proposed
exception would have little to no effect on the client's
willingness to confide in his attorney. He reasons that only
clients intending to perjure themselves will be chilled by a rule
of disclosure after death, as opposed to truthful clients or those
asserting their Fifth Amendment privilege. This is because for the
latter group, communications disclosed by the attorney after the
client's death purportedly will reveal only information that the
client himself would have revealed if alive.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel assumes, incorrectly we believe, that
the privilege is analogous to the Fifth Amendment's protection
against self-incrimination. But as suggested above, the privilege
serves much broader purposes. Clients consult attorneys for a wide
variety of reasons, only one of which involves possible criminal
liability. Many attorneys act as counselors on personal and family
matters, where, in the course of obtaining the desired advice,
confidences about family members or financial problems must be
revealed in order to assure sound legal advice. The same is true of
owners of small businesses who may regularly consult their
attorneys about a variety of problems arising in the course of the
business. These confidences may not come close to any sort of
admission of criminal wrongdoing, but nonetheless be matters which
the client would not wish divulged.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The contention that the attorney is being required to disclose
only what the client could have been required to disclose is at
odds with the basis for the privilege even during the client's
lifetime. In related cases, we have said that the loss of evidence
admittedly caused by the privilege is justified in part by the fact
that without the privilege, the client may not have made such
communications in the first place. This is true of disclosure
before and after the client's death. Without assurance of the
privilege's posthumous application, the client may very well not
have made disclosures to his attorney at all, so the loss of
evidence is more apparent than real. In the case at hand, it seems
quite plausible that Foster, perhaps already contemplating suicide,
may not have sought legal advice from Hamilton if he had not been
assured the conversation was privileged.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel additionally suggests that his proposed
exception would have minimal impact if confined to criminal cases,
or, as the Court of Appeals suggests, if it is limited to
information of substantial importance to a particular criminal
case. However, there is no case authority for the proposition that
the privilege applies differently in criminal and civil cases. In
any event, a client may not know at the time he discloses
information to his attorney whether it will later be relevant to a
civil or a criminal matter, let alone whether it will be of
substantial importance. Balancing ex post the importance of the
information against client interests, even limited to criminal
cases, introduces substantial uncertainty into the privilege's
application. For just that reason, we have rejected use of a
balancing test in defining the contours of the privilege.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar vein, the independent counsel argues that existing
exceptions to the privilege, such as the crime-fraud exception and
the testamentary exception, make the impact of one more exception
marginal. However, these exceptions do not demonstrate that the
impact of a posthumous exception would be insignificant, and there
is little empirical evidence on this point. The established
exceptions are consistent with the purposes of the privilege, while
a posthumous exception in criminal cases appears at odds with the
goals of encouraging full and frank communication and of protecting
the client's interests. A ``no-harm-in-one-more-exception''
rationale could contribute to the general erosion of the privilege,
without reference to common law principles or ``reason and
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been generally, if not universally, accepted, for well
over a century, that the attorney-client privilege survives the
death of the client in a case such as this. While the arguments
against the survival of the privilege are by no means frivolous,
they are based in large part on speculation, thoughtful
speculation, but speculation nonetheless as to whether posthumous
termination of the privilege would diminish a client's willingness
to confide in an attorney. In an area where empirical information
would be useful, it is scant and inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 501's direction to look to ``the principles of the common
law as they may be interpreted by the courts of the United States
in the light of reason and experience'' does not mandate that a
rule, once established, should endure for all time. But here the
independent counsel has simply not made a sufficient showing to
overturn the common-law rule embodied in the prevailing case law.
Interpreted in the light of reason and experience, that body of law
requires that the attorney-client privilege prevent disclosure of
the notes at issue in this case.
</P>
<P>
   FROM THE DISSENT
</P>
<P>
   By Justice O'Connor
</P>
<P>
   Although the attorney-client privilege ordinarily will survive
the death of the client, I do not agree with the Court that it
inevitably precludes disclosure of a deceased client's
communications in criminal proceedings. In my view, a criminal
defendant's right to exculpatory evidence or a compelling law
enforcement need for information may, where the testimony is not
available from other sources, override a client's posthumous
interest in confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   We have long recognized that ``(t)he fundamental basis upon
which all rules of evidence must rest if they are to rest upon
reason is their adaptation to the successful development of the
truth.'' In light of the heavy burden that they place on the search
for truth, see United States vs. Nixon (1974), ``(e)videntiary
privileges in litigation are not favored, and even those rooted in
the Constitution must give way in proper circumstances.''
Consequently, we construe the scope of privileges narrowly. We are
reluctant to recognize a privilege or read an existing one
expansively unless to do so will serve a ``public good transcending
the normally predominant principle of utilizing all rational means
for ascertaining truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorney-client privilege promotes trust in the
representational relationship, thereby facilitating the provision
of legal services and ultimately the administration of justice. The
systemic benefits of the privilege are commonly understood to
outweigh the harm caused by excluding critical evidence. A
privilege should operate, however, only where ``necessary to
achieve its purpose,'' and an invocation of the attorney-client
privilege should not go unexamined ``when it is shown that the
interests of the administration of justice can only be frustrated
by (its) exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   I agree that a deceased client may retain a personal,
reputational and economic interest in confidentiality. But, after
death, the potential that disclosure will harm the client's
interests has been greatly diminished, and the risk that the client
will be held criminally liable has abated altogether.
</P>
<P>
   This diminished risk is coupled with a heightened urgency for
discovery of a deceased client's communications in the criminal
context. The privilege does not ``protect disclosure of the
underlying facts by those who communicated with the attorney,'' and
were the client living, prosecutors could grant immunity and compel
the relevant testimony. After a client's death, however, if the
privilege precludes an attorney from testifying in the client's
stead, a complete ``loss of crucial information'' will often
result.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As the Court of Appeals observed, the costs of recognizing an
absolute posthumous privilege can be inordinately high. Extreme
injustice may occur, for example, where a criminal defendant seeks
disclosure of a deceased client's confession to the offense. In my
view, the paramount value that our criminal justice system places
on protecting an innocent defendant should outweigh a deceased
client's interest in preserving confidences. Indeed, even
petitioner acknowledges that an exception may be appropriate where
the constitutional rights of a criminal defendant are at stake.
</P>
<P>
   An exception may likewise be warranted in the face of a
compelling law enforcement need for the information. ``(O)ur
historic commitment to the rule of law is nowhere more profoundly
manifest than in our view that the twofold aim of criminal justice
is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that the complete exclusion of relevant evidence from a
criminal trial or investigation may distort the record, mislead the
fact finder, and undermine the central truth-seeking function of
the courts, I do not believe that the attorney-client privilege
should act as an absolute bar to the disclosure of a deceased
client's communications. When the privilege is asserted in the
criminal context, and a showing is made that the communications at
issue contain necessary factual information not otherwise
available, courts should be permitted to assess whether interests
in fairness and accuracy outweigh the justifications for the
privilege.
</P>
<P>
   In the situation where the posthumous privilege most frequently
arises, a dispute between heirs over the decedent's will, the
privilege is widely recognized to give way to the interest in
settling the estate. This testamentary exception, moreover, may be
invoked in some cases where the decedent would not have chosen to
waive the privilege. For example, ``a decedent might want to
provide for an illegitimate child but at the same time much prefer
that the relationship go undisclosed.'' Among the Court's
rationales for a broad construction of the posthumous privilege is
its assertion that ``(m)any attorneys act as counselors on personal
and family matters, where, in the course of obtaining the desired
advice, confidences about family members or financial problems must
be revealed . . . which the client would not wish divulged.''
</P>
<P>
   That reasoning, however, would apply in the testamentary context
with equal force. Nor are other existing exceptions to the
privilege for example, the crime-fraud exception or the exceptions
for claims relating to attorney competence or compensation
necessarily consistent with ``encouraging full and frank
communication'' or ``protecting the client's interests.'' Rather,
those exceptions reflect the understanding that, in certain
circumstances, the privilege ``ceases to operate'' as a safeguard
on ``the proper functioning of our adversary system.''
</P>
<P>
   Where the exoneration of an innocent criminal defendant or a
compelling law enforcement interest is at stake, the harm of
precluding critical evidence that is unavailable by any other means
outweighs the potential disincentive to forthright communication.
In my view, the cost of silence warrants a narrow exception to the
rule that the attorney-client privilege survives the death of the
client.

   XI'AN, China _ Greeted by thunderous drummers and delicate
dancers, President Clinton received an emperor's welcome Thursday
in China's ancient capital city, where he began a nine-day tour

   Xi'an is the first stop on a five-city tour that also will take
the president to Beijing to meet with President Jiang Zemin, to the
financial center of Shanghai, to the mountainous Guilin and to Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
   The trip comes at a sensitive time in U.S.-Chinese relations as
Asia faces an economic crisis and an nuclear arms escalation on the
Indian subcontinent. It also comes as Congress investigates China's
role in the 1996 U.S. elections and whether the Chinese also
received information that allowed the massive country to improve
its missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``A new day is dawning for the Chinese people, for China's
greatness lies, as always, with its people,'' said Clinton,
standing before the dramatically lit 14th-century fortress wall
that protected Xi'an's old central city from outsiders and
invaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this global information age, where both economic growth and
individual opportunity are based on ideas, a commitment to
providing all human beings the opportunity to develop their full
potential is vital to the strength and success of the new China as
well,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, Chinese agents arrested Yan Jun, a Xi'an
dissident who was one of 70 people who signed a letter asking
Clinton to meet with democracy advocates. They also detained Li
Xiaolong in the southern Guangxi province, and Li Zhiying of
ChengCheng, according to wire reports.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Mike McCurry indicated it was unlikely
Clinton would meet with dissidents, for fear of triggering
government reprisals.
</P>
<P>
   China's leaders, President Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji,
desperately want to present the nation's best face as Clinton's
tour draws international attention.
</P>
<P>
   But the detentions and the rejection of visas for Radio Free
Asia reporters cast a pall on the visit and bolstered the critics
who assailed Clinton for making the journey.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton twice ignored media questions about the dissidents'
arrests. Later, a White House spokesman said the administration was
aware of the detention reports and that U.S. Ambassador James
Sasser would raise the issue with Chinese officials Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright also sent letters
protesting the rejection of visas for three people who work for
Voice of America's Radio Free Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president, in his meetings with President Jiang, will
encourage China to allow freer political dialogue so that all
Chinese citizens can be free to express their political beliefs
without government interference,'' said spokesman P.J. Crowley.
</P>
<P>
   The people of Xi'an turned out in droves to catch a glimpse of
the president and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands, standing quietly, lined up 10 deep to watch
Clinton's 50-car motorcade pass through the city. A threatened
protest over inadequate housing in Xi'an never materialized, or at
least was not seen.
</P>
<P>
   Xi'an Mayor Feng Xucchu treated Clinton to the 8th-century Tang
Dynasty ``Emperor's Welcome'' in which 150 people dressed as
ancient warriors, horseback riders, drummers and dancers gathered
for an elaborate twilight ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and the U.S. delegation walked down 200 yards of red
carpet before the South Gate of the 36-foot high fortress wall,
outlined by small yellow lights. As drummers banged on large kettle
drums, women dressed in white and bearing flowers danced before the
entourage. Afterward, the delegation walked across a drawbridge and
into the old city itself.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told the invited guests that he hoped he would learn
more about China and that China would learn more about the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe both Chinese and Americans aspire to many of the
same things _ to provide for our families, to teach our children,
to build our communities, to protect our Earth, to shape our own
futures and pass brighter possibilities on to our children,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be those here and back in America who wonder whether
closer ties and deeper friendship between America and China are
good. Clearly the answer is yes,'' the president said. ``We have a
powerful ability to help each other grow. We can learn much from
each other. The steps we take over the next week can lead to far
greater strides for our people in the years ahead.''

   JERUSALEM _ The remains of an Israeli soldier killed in a failed
marine commando raid in Lebanon last September were flown to Israel
on Thursday in exchange for the bodies of 40 Lebanese guerrillas
and the freeing Friday of 60 prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Before the swap between Israel and the Iranian-backed Shiite
Muslim group Hezbollah, two more Israeli soldiers were killed in
the Israeli occupation zone in southern Lebanon in an attack
claimed by Hezbollah. But the exchange, reached after 10 months of
tortuous negotiations mediated by the Lebanese government, France
and the Red Cross, proceeded as planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Along with the war there are also human sides,'' said Maj.
Gen. Amiram Levine, the Israeli army's northern front commander.
``If this is a sign of feelers, humanity and dialogue, than it is a
very important step.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army said it had received the remains of Staff Sgt.
Itamar Ilya, 21, who was killed by explosives he was carrying when
his commando squad was hit by roadside charges while on a raid
north of the Israeli occupation zone Sept. 4. Twelve marine
commandos died in the botched operation, but all the bodies except
Ilya's were recovered. It was the highest single Israeli death toll
in Lebanon in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah said it had also returned body parts of at least two
other Israelis killed in the raid, but an Israeli army spokesman
declined to say whether other remains were received.
</P>
<P>
   Among the corpses of guerrillas turned over by Israel was that
of Hadi Nasrallah, the son of the leader of Hezbollah, Sheik Hassan
Nasrallah. The son was killed in a clash with Israeli troops, and
his body had been held by the Israelis as a bargaining chip for the
return of Ilya's remains.
</P>
<P>
   After Hezbollah and Amal, another Shiite guerrilla group,
transferred the remains to the Lebanese army, they were flown to
Israel on a French military transport plane.
</P>
<P>
   The plane landed at dusk at an Israeli air force base near Tel
Aviv, where it was boarded by the army's chief rabbi, Maj. Gen. Gad
Navon, for what was described as identification of Ilya's remains.
They were transferred to a simple wooden coffin that was carried
off the plane, draped in an Israeli flag, by comrades of the dead
soldier.
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, soldiers moved 40 numbered wooden coffins of
guerrillas from flatbed trucks to the transport plane, which later
took off for Beirut. The bodies had been unearthed overnight from
cemeteries in northern Israel, where they had been kept for
possible exchanges for Israeli captives or war dead.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``For us, every combatant, every soldier in the army, every
missing soldier, every prisoner of war _ it is our obligation to
find him and return him to his country and to his family,'' said
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a speech in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   In Beirut, Hezbollah put up banners welcoming ``the returning
martyrs'' and posters of Kalashnikov rifles on the route from the
airport into the city. Nasrallah said that he drew ``a measure of
comfort'' from the return of his son's body, and credited the
guerrilla ``resistance'' for making the exchange possible.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Israel is scheduled to free 60 Lebanese prisoners from
Hezbollah, Amal and other guerrilla groups. Ten will be released
from jails in Israel and 50 from a prison run in southern Lebanon
by Israel's militia ally there, the South Lebanon Army. An Israeli
military statement said that those to be released are ``without
blood on their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's violence, two bombs exploded near a group of
Israeli soldiers, killing two and injuring two in southern Lebanon.
Hezbollah is fighting to evict Israeli troops from a nine-mile wide
swath of territory there that is held as a buffer against attacks
on northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing deaths in southern Lebanon have set off a debate
among Israelis about whether the army should cut its losses,
withdraw from the area and defend Israel from its northern border.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu has offered to pull out if the Lebanese army
guarantees security. But the Lebanese government and Syria, the
main power broker in Lebanon, have rejected the idea.

 &HT;    GM workers seek unemployment pay
 &HT;    By Kristi E. Swartz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Travis Brideman has been through this before.
</P>
<P>
   Brideman, who has been out of work a week because of a forced
shutdown of General Motors Corp.'s assembly plant, lined up with
fellow workers Thursday to file for unemployment benefits with the
Georgia Labor Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to prepare,'' said Brideman, who has been at the
Doraville plant for 19 years.
</P>
<P>
   More than 3,000 Doraville workers have been off the job because
of a shortage of parts caused by United Auto Workers strikes in
Flint, Mich. Thursday was the first day they could file for
unemployment benefits, a maximum of $224 a week, about half their
GM pay. They got their last GM paycheck Thursday and could start
receiving unemployment checks in one to two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Brideman said he hasn't been looking for temporary work yet but
said he will if the strike goes far into the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Labor Department and union officials are helping workers fill
out applications Thursday and today at the UAW Local 10 building.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all of the idled workers are expected to file for
benefits, according to Labor Department spokesman Sam Hall and UAW
Local 10 President Bill Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they think they may be eligible, they should file because
each claim is decided on its own merit,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia law requires those filing for unemployment be out of
work through no fault of their own; actively seek full-time
employment; and be physically and mentally able to take a job if
one is offered.
</P>
<P>
   Because the shutdown was caused by a labor dispute, the labor
commissioner will appoint a tribunal from GM and UAW officials to
determine whether to grant benefits, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   GM will challenge unemployment claims because paying those
claims means the company would be financing a strike against
itself, said GM spokesman Gerry Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   If workers are denied benefits, they can receive strike pay of
$150 a week from the union.

 &HT;    AT&AMP;T deal starts race among Net providers
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- AT&AMP;T's pending purchase of Tele-Communications has
sounded off like a starter's gun in the executive suites of the
telephone and cable TV industries.
</P>
<P>
   While both industries compete already for Internet and telephone
customers, the race among them will now begin in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   It's a race that will involve some of Atlanta's biggest
companies, including cable operator Cox Communications, BellSouth
Corp., Scientific-Atlanta and Hayes Microcomputers.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them are doing what AT&AMP;T plans to do with TCI: offer
Internet access and local telephone service through cable's digital
two-way lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``This merger is a good thing for the industry and a good thing
for Scientific-Atlanta,'' says Steve Necessary, a vice president
for marketing. His company's products include a set-top box that
enables the two-way features of cable's new digital lines.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, the number of households connected to the Internet
has grown 89 percent, according to a study by online consultant
Jupiter Communications. It projects the number of households will
reach 57 million by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   With 22.6 million customers, independent providers such as
MindSpring and America Online have the lead so far. Next come the
telephone companies, with 5.7 million customers.
</P>
<P>
   While far behind, cable operators such as Cox Communications are
growing. There are an estimated 200,000-plus households using cable
lines to reach the Net at speeds up to 100 times faster than
traditional telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   That number represents a tiny portion of the 68 million
households with cable TV. In part, it's because only about 15
percent of the nation's cable lines have been upgraded to provide
the service.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also true there isn't much demand yet for cable modems.
Most customers have fast connections at work and want the same at
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cable has a great pipe but, will this service take off
tomorrow?'' says Bruce Leitchman, a media analyst with the Yankee
Group. ``The answer is no. Nor will it take off in the next four
years, but it is a great long-run play.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Atlanta companies are gambling big on the potential of
cable Internet access and telephone service. Cox Communications,
for example, now offers high-speed Internet connections through
cable modems in parts of its systems in Orange County, Calif., San
Diego and Phoenix. It also has begun offering telephone service in
some of these areas.
</P>
<P>
   And in metro Atlanta, cable operators MediaOne and Comcast are
offering the service. Less than 1,000 households have ordered cable
modems so far in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   While these numbers seem small, some industry observers are not
discouraged. ``Cable modems are doing better than anticipated,''
says Zia Daniell, a media analyst with Jupiter Communications.
``We're very bullish.''

 &HT;    Takeover rumor springs MindSpring stock
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Speculation of a takeover bid sent shares of the
Atlanta-based MindSpring Enterprises soaring to an all time high
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring closed Thursday at $94.88 up $14.31. In early
trading, the stock reached an all time high of $96.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the speculation fueled by the news of the
AT&AMP;T-Telecommunications Inc. merger, the company announced a
three-to-one stock split aimed at attracting more individual
investors. The split will be the company's first, payable July 24
to shareholders of record July 9.
</P>
<P>
   The MindSpring stock surge has Wall Street analysts once again
speculating that the Atlanta Internet service provider (ISP) is
ripe for acquisition, something the company continually denies.
Rumors of a MindSpring takeover have been circulating ever since
the company's stock began to climb in early March.
</P>
<P>
   Michael McQuary, president and chief operating officer says the
company is open to offers, though acquisitions aren't a focus right
now. ``We are always talking to major players. If an interesting
offer came along we would consider it, but right now we are just
trying to build our own company. ''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is speculation that MindSpring is a target. It's that cut
and dry,'' said analyst Jeff Sadler of Robinson-Humphrey. Sadler
says a potential suitor would either be looking for a quality
provider or one with a large subscriber base. ``And America Online
has politely said they are not for sale.''

EXCERPTS FROM HIGH COURT OPINIONS IN LINE-ITEM VETO CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (with SCOTUS-VETO)  
 (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from Thursday's Supreme
Court decision striking down the presidential line-item veto. The
opinion in the case, Clinton vs. City of New York, was written by
Justice John Paul Stevens and joined by Justices William H.
Rehnquist, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter, Clarence Thomas and
Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Dissenting opinions, which are also excerpted
below, were filed by Justice Antonin Scalia, with whom Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor joined, and by Justice Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   FROM THE DECISION
</P>
<P>
   By Justice Stevens  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Line Item Veto Act . . . was enacted in April 1996 and
became effective on January 1, 1997. The following day, six members
of Congress who had voted against the act brought suit in the
District Court for the District of Columbia challenging its
constitutionality. On April 10, 1997, the District Court entered an
order holding that the Act is unconstitutional. Byrd vs. Raines. In
obedience to the statutory direction to allow a direct, expedited
appeal to this Court . . . we promptly noted probable jurisdiction
and expedited review. . . . We determined, however, that the
members of Congress did not have standing to sue because they had
not ``alleged a sufficiently concrete injury to have established
Article III standing . . . thus, ``in light of (the) overriding and
time-honored concern about keeping the judiciary's power within its
proper constitutional sphere,'' . . . we remanded the case to the
District Court with instructions to dismiss the complaint for lack
of jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two months after our decision in that case, the
President exercised his authority to cancel one provision in the
Balanced Budget Act of 1997 . . . and two provisions in the
Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 . . . Appellees, claiming that they had
been injured by two of those cancellations, filed these cases in
the District Court. That Court again held the statute invalid, . .
. and we again expedited our review . . . We now hold that these
appellees have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the
act and, reaching the merits, we agree that the cancellation
procedures set forth in the Act violate the Presentment Clause,
Art. I, 7, cl. 2, of the Constitution. .
</P>
<P>
   In both legal and practical effect, the President has amended
two Acts of Congress by repealing a portion of each. ``(R)epeal of
statutes, no less than enactment, must conform with Art. I.'' There
is no provision in the Constitution that authorizes the President
to enact, to amend, or to repeal statutes. Both Article I and
Article II assign responsibilities to the President that directly
relate to the lawmaking process, but neither addresses the issue
presented by these cases. The President ``shall from time to time
give to the Congress Information on the State of the Union, and
recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge
necessary and expedient.'' Art. II, 3. Thus, he may initiate and
influence legislative proposals. (footnote 27) Moreover, after a
bill has passed both houses of Congress, but ``before it become(s)
a law,'' it must be presented to the President. If he approves it,
``he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his
objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who
shall enter the objections at large on their journal, and proceed
to reconsider it.'' Art. I, 7, cl. 2. (footnote 28) His ``return''
of a bill, which is usually described as a ``veto,'' (footnote 29)
is subject to being overridden by a two-thirds vote in each House.
</P>
<P>
   There are important differences between the President's
``return'' of a bill pursuant to Article I, 7 and the exercise of
the President's cancellation authority pursuant to the Line Item
Veto Act. The constitutional return takes place BEFORE the bill
becomes law; the statutory cancellation occurs AFTER the bill
becomes law. The constitutional return is of the entire bill; the
statutory cancellation is of only a part. Although the Constitution
expressly authorizes the President to play a role in the process of
enacting statutes, it is silent on the subject of unilateral
Presidential action that either repeals or amends parts of duly
enacted statutes.
</P>
<P>
   There are powerful reasons for construing constitutional silence
on this profoundly important issue as equivalent to an express
prohibition. The procedures governing the enactment of statutes set
forth in the text of Article I were the product of the great
debates and compromises that produced the Constitution itself.
Familiar historical materials provide abundant support for the
conclusion that the power to enact statutes may only ``be exercised
in accord with a single, finely wrought and exhaustively
considered, procedure.'' Our first President understood the text of
the Presentment Clause as requiring that he either ``approve all
the parts of a bill, or reject it in toto.'' (footnote 30) What has
emerged in these cases from the President's exercise of his
statutory cancellation powers, however, are truncated versions of
two bills that passed both Houses of Congress. They are not the
product of the ``finely wrought'' procedure that the Framers
designed. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The Line Item Veto Act authorizes the President himself to
effect the repeal of laws, for his own policy reasons, without
observing the procedures set out in Article I, 7. The fact that
Congress intended such a result is of no moment. Although Congress
presumably anticipated that the President might cancel some of the
items in the Balanced Budget Act and in the Taxpayer Relief Act,
Congress cannot alter the procedures set out in Article I, 7,
without amending the Constitution. (footnote 40) . . .
</P>
<P>
   If the Line Item Veto Act were valid, it would authorize the
President to create a different law, one whose text was not voted
on by either House of Congress or presented to the President for
signature. Something that might be known as ``Public Law 105-33 as
modified by the President'' may or may not be desirable, but it is
surely not a document that may ``become a law'' pursuant to the
procedures designed by the Framers of Article I, 7, of the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   If there is to be a new procedure in which the President will
play a different role in determining the final text of what may
``become a law,'' such change must come not by legislation but
through the amendment procedures set forth in Article V of the
Constitution. . . .

   Insofar as the degree of political, ``law-making'' power
conferred upon the Executive is concerned, there is not a dime's
worth of difference between Congress' authorizing the President to
CANCEL a spending item, and Congress' authorizing money to be spent
on a particular item at the President's discretion. And the latter
has been done since the founding of the nation. From 1789-1791, the
First Congress made lump-sum appropriations for the entire
government ``sum(s) not exceeding'' specified amounts for broad
purposes. From a very early date Congress also made permissive
individual appropriations, leaving the decision whether to spend
the money to the President's unfettered discretion. . . . Examples
of appropriations committed to the discretion of the President
abound in our history. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Had the Line Item Veto Act authorized the President to ``decline
to spend'' any item of spending contained in the Balanced Budget
Act of 1997, there is not the slightest doubt that authorization
would have been constitutional. What the Line Item Veto Act does
instead authorizing the President to ``cancel'' an item of spending
is technically different. But the technical difference does NOT
relate to the technicalities of the Presentment Clause, which have
been fully complied with; and the doctrine of unconstitutional
delegation, which IS at issue here, is pre-eminently NOT a doctrine
of technicalities.
</P>
<P>
   The title of the Line Item Veto Act, which was perhaps designed
to simplify for public comprehension, or perhaps merely to comply
with the terms of a campaign pledge, has succeeded in faking out
the Supreme Court. The President's action it authorizes in fact is
not a line item veto and thus does not offend Art. I, 7; and
insofar as the substance of that action is concerned, it is no
different from what Congress has permitted the President to do
since the formation of the Union.
</P>
<P>
   FROM THE DISSENT
</P>
<P>
   By Justice Breyer
</P>
<P>
   In sum, I recognize that the act before us is novel. In a sense,
it skirts a constitutional edge. But that edge has to do with
means, not ends. The means chosen do not amount literally to the
enactment, repeal or amendment of a law. Nor, for that matter, do
they amount literally to the ``line item veto'' that the act's
title announces. Those means do not violate any basic separation of
powers principle. They do not improperly shift the constitutionally
foreseen balance of power from Congress to the President. Nor,
since they comply with Separation of Powers principles, do they
threaten the liberties of individual citizens. They represent an
experiment that may, or may not, help representative government
work better. The Constitution, in my view, authorizes Congress and
the President to try novel methods in this way. Consequently, with
respect, I dissent.

COURT RULES LINE-ITEM VETO UNCONSTITUTIONAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDs: SUBS 15thgraf to add dropped word _ $700 MILLION sted $700) (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court said Thursday that Congress
violated the Constitution's separation-of-powers rule when it gave
the president authority to cut individual projects out of tax and
spending bills without vetoing the entire legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In a 6-3 decision, the court said the 1996 Line Item Veto Act
unconstitutionally allows the president, by altering a bill after
its passage, to create a law that was not voted on by either house
of Congress. The court also said the 1996 measure authorized the
president to issue what were, in practical terms, partial vetoes.
</P>
<P>
   The only way such vetoes can be authorized is through a
constitutional amendment, the justices said.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the court, Justice John Paul Stevens said
authorization for a presidential line item veto could not come from
Congress ``but through the amendment procedures set forth in
Article V of the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Republican Sens. Dan Coats of Indiana and John McCain
of Arizona introduced a bill hours after the court's ruling seeking
to undo it by statute rather than amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the decision ``a defeat for fiscal responsibility and a
defeat for the American taxpayer,'' the senators said their measure
would require that individual spending items be considered as
separate bills, allowing the president to veto them individually.
</P>
<P>
   In passing the 1996 law, Congress said the president could
cancel individual items in tax and spending bills within five days
of signing them into law. But the measure allowed lawmakers to try
to reinstate the items by having both houses pass them in separate
bills.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was the first president to exercise a line item veto, an
authority sought by nearly every chief executive this century as a
tool to limit pork-barrel spending.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said the law ``authorized the president himself to
effect the repeal of laws, for his own policy reasons, without
observing Article 1 procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   Article 1 of the Constitution established the principle of
separation of powers among the three branches of government.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens concluded that the 1996 act ``may or may not be
desirable, but it is surely not a document'' that is
constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the justices heard a challenge to the act brought by
six members of Congress, but it dismissed their suit, saying they
had no standing to sue because they had not suffered any injury
from the veto, which at that point Clinton had not exercised.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the president has canceled 82 items in 11 laws.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, New York City, a hospital and two hospital
associations, challenged the law, arguing that one of the canceled
items had caused them financial injury. Their suit sought
restoration of a provision that would have given New York state
preferential treatment in receiving federal matching funds under
the Medicaid program for poor people.
</P>
<P>
   The state estimated that losing the matching funds would cost it
as much as $700 million annually. The city was expected to lose
nearly $400 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, this case was about more than an important
constitutional principle,'' said Leonard J. Koerner, the lawyer
representing the City of New York. ``It was about a large amount of
money that we were going to lose year after year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Snake River Potato Growers and an officer of the Idaho group
also sued, saying they were injured by Clinton's veto of a tax
measure that would have allowed agricultural processors to defer
capital-gains taxes when they sell their plants to farmers'
cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration estimated that the growers would have
been able to avoid paying $98 million in taxes over the next five
years and $155 million over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a U.S. District Court here ruled the line-item veto
unconstitutional, saying Congress violated the Constitution's
separation of powers clause by delegating a key legislative power
to the president.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday the high court agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens acknowledged the ``profound importance'' of the case,
saying, ``The court expresses no opinion about the wisdom of the
act's procedures and does not lightly conclude that the actions of
the Congress that passed it, and the president who signed it into
law, were unconstitutional.''
</P>
<P>
   In their arguments before the court, lawyers for the challengers
said that no matter when a president changes a tax or spending bill
or for what reasons, the end result is not what was passed by both
chambers of Congress, as required by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   In his argument for the Clinton administration, U.S. Solicitor
General Seth Waxman contended that a line item veto would not
actually repeal part of a law but would be a presidential exercise
of spending authority delegated by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens was joined in his opinion by Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, David Souter, Clarence
Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Stephen Breyer, Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia
dissented.
</P>
<P>
   Breyer's dissent said that while the Line Item Veto Act ``skirts
a constitutional edge ... it does not violate any basic separation
of powers principle.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the court, in applying the Constitution's
provisions delegating legislative powers to Congress and vesting
executive powers in the president, has in the past ``interpreted
them generously in terms of the institutional arrangements that
they permit.''

COMMENTARY: CLINTON GETS RESULTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By A.M. ROSENTHAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After six years, President Clinton's foreign policy has brought
dramatic results. It has strengthened the world's three major
dictatorships, won the contempt of America's friends and enemies
for its word and determination, and helped spread missile
weaponry. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That alone would be a historic record for a president to achieve
with two years still to go. But Clinton has also labored to create
attitudes in Americans themselves that demean America's vision of
itself and of duties that freedom imposes on it.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Never before have the thoughts, statements and actions of a U.S.
president been so favorably influenced by any dictatorship as
Clinton's by China, and its business, intellectual and journalistic
support groups in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Many of America's allies have also been doing their best to help
China and the two other dictatorships _ Iraq and Iran. Like Clinton
in China, they chase trade profits over democratic principle.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But America's allies never claimed leadership of the free world
or keen interest in democracy outside their borders. For them it is
business as usual _ like the buildup of Saddam Hussein before the
gulf war. But for a U.S. president to walk away from those who
believed in America to those who torture them is, of course,
betrayal of U.S. history and promises.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's grand voyage to China is a symbol of his achievements.
Already he has given Beijing much of what it craves _ missile
technology and huge commercial trade, all benefiting the Chinese
Communist Party and armed forces, a gentle eye toward Chinese
missile and nuclear sales, and a complete reversal of his
pre-election promises to link trade with human rights.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So, on to Tiananmen we go. Could the killers in the Politburo
have dreamt that a U.S. president would give them so much honor,
respectability and absolution _ all for vast trade profits, which
turned out to be vast trade deficits for America?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About Iraq: Clinton, like George Bush before him, let Iraq get
away with what Saddam Hussein then wanted most. That was clear
fields to slaughter the Iraqi opposition.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then, when Saddam smashed the U.N. inspection system for as many
months as he wished, Clinton agreed with the United Nations on the
appropriate punishment: none.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after seven years of Iraqi refusal to reveal the truth
about its preparations for making weapons of mass destruction, a
plan was worked out at the U.N. that could have lifted sanctions,
possibly beginning in October. Let's not be dullwits: everybody at
the U.N. knows Saddam will again set to making forbidden weapons
and already is revered by Arabs as the victor over America, which
he is.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But evidence of Iraqi nerve gas production was discovered, so
the sanctions-lifting may be delayed. Washington has the veto power
_ but no longer the political clout to prevent U.N. members from
selling Saddam what he wants, veto or no.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. also refuses to pay its U.N. dues. Blame this on
Congress, not the administration or the U.N. delegation led by the
much-respected Bill Richardson. But nobody likes losers and
deadbeats, particularly two in one. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now it is Iran's turn for a Clintonian helping hand. He waived
sanctions against Russia and France for pouring billions into
Iranian gas fields. Then he offered to start making nice with Iran
itself, not just its suppliers.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Iran is still run by the same folk who made it the world's
center of terrorism and anti-American hate propaganda. But never
mind _ Mobil oil is ecstatic about the curtsey to Tehran.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will give the same rationalization for a deal with Iran
as for selling missile technology to China: ``Engagement'' with
China is better than isolating it. He knows the comparison is
lividly false, of course. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Americans who oppose his empowerment of China do not want to
isolate it. They want engagement _ not as appeasers, but free
people trying to use U.S. political and economic pressure to ease
political shackles in China and Tibet, end forced abortions and
religious persecution and release the 5 to 7 million slave-labor
prisoners.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Usually without nuisance of trial, they work in factories built
into the prisons, dual use with bars and prods, part of national
budgeting. Clinton, the whole family, might have fun dropping in.

DONATO, KHRISTICH COULD FACE TRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ While the Bruins prepare for Friday's NHL expansion
draft and Saturday's entry draft, they are also mulling the future
of some players currently on their roster _ Ted Donato and Dmitri
Khristich, who will become restricted free agents Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be surprising to see Donato, 29, moved to another
team. His ice time diminished last season under first-year coach
Pat Burns, and president/general manager Harry Sinden said that
last spring, Donato asked to be traded if he wasn't going to be
used more.
</P>
<P>
   ``His role changed on the team this year,'' said Sinden. ``He
and Steve Heinze used to kill a lot of penalties. They didn't this
year. Then Donato wasn't a real regular among the first nine
forwards. His role changed, particularly in the last month of the
season. There's a possibility that for his sake and our sake, we
should be talking to teams about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Donato finished seventh on the club in scoring with 16 goals and
39 points, his fewest since the lockout-shortened 1994-95 season.
What could make him tradeable is that he can play all three forward
positions and makes a reasonable salary of $962,500, about the
league average.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time I talked to him, he was unhappy in his role,''
said Sinden. ``I said to him then that it might change. I told him,
`If your role doesn't change between now and the end of the season,
then we'll see what's available.' I don't think there's a lot of
sense to have Ted play another year here with the same amount of
ice time as he got the last couple of months of last year. He's
been a useful player and he probably could still be. If nothing
happens, he could still help us, but he's a guy we'd probably be
talking to other teams about.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins expect that Khristich, who played most of the season
with center Jason Allison and rookie Sergei Samsonov and finished
second on the club in scoring with 29 goals and 66 points, will
exercise his option to take the team to arbitration in an effort to
increase his salary, which was $1 million last season. There was
speculation that Khristich might be moved because his play was
affected at times by his distraction over his contract, which
clearly aggravated Burns. But Sinden said the Bruins would like to
keep Khristich, who turns 29 next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a little moody, he sulks around a little bit, but he's a
good hockey player,'' said Sinden. ``That line was a pretty
effective line. I was sure that if we gave him what we asked for,
he'd be a lot happier. But I would think he'd go to arbitration and
put his case in front of the arbitrator. I wouldn't put him high on
our list of a guy we were going to try to trade unless we got a
very unreasonable arbitration award. We'd probably live with the
arbitrator's award.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the future of goalie Jim Carey, who, unlike Donato and
Khristich, was left exposed for the expansion draft, Sinden said
the Bruins haven't decided.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expansion is coming up next year, too,'' said Sinden,
referring to when Atlanta enters the league for the 1999-2000
season. ``Although we can't plan too far ahead, the same situation
is going to be here next year as far as goalies go. If Byron Dafoe
and Robbie Tallas have good seasons, we don't want to expose them
again. There's a chance Jim Carey can come back and play like he
did for a few years there.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, we've got to make a decision because it's a
lot of money for a guy who doesn't play ($2.2 million). I guess our
decision will be, do we go and trust he'll come back to form or
that he'll be available to go into the draft next year or do we
throw good money after bad? I think he's a pretty good gamble.
You're not the best goalie in the NHL for nothing. He got an awful
lot very quickly. He went from a minor league goalie to the Vezina
Trophy winner and got a huge, huge contract for a guy who had one
year's success. It might have had an effect on him. Maybe he's over
that now.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the entry draft, in which the Bruins have no first-round
picks, two seconds, a third, fifth, sixth, and ninth, Sinden said
there could be a surprise or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a couple of things in mind that we're reasonably
excited about,'' he said. ``I think we've got a couple of sleepers
there.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he doesn't expect a great deal from the later rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last 10 years, there have probably averaged 20-22 teams
in the league each of those years,'' he said. ``After the third
round, there have been six rounds. If there were 22 teams drafting
for six rounds, that's 132 players a year times 10 years, which is
1,320. If 20 of them made it, I'd be surprised.''

TREASURIES RECOVER EARLY LOSSES; DOLLAR GAINS ON YEN
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Treasury prices pared early losses and ended little
changed Thursday, as the dollar gained in currency trading against
the yen. Prices were also weakened by dealers' hedging Freddie
Mac's $4 billion global bond offering Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But trading volume in the Treasury market was nearly half of the
average for a Thursday in the second quarter, so price movements
are exaggerated somewhat.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year bond edged up 2/32, to 106 24/32. The
bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price,
slipped to 5.65 percent, from 5.66 percent on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury prices came under pressure as underwriters led by Bear,
Stearns &AMP; Co., J.P. Morgan and Salomon Smith Barney, sold the
five-year Freddie Mac note issue at a price to yield 5.77 percent,
or about 26 basis points over the new five-year Treasury note sold
Wednesday. (A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.)
</P>
<P>
   Also weighing on the market was the slightly stronger than
expected housing data, early weakness in the dollar against the
Japanese yen, a strong stock market that gave back a good chunk of
its gains during the day, supply and technical factors.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said shorter-maturity bills were in strong demand for
the most part as the 3-month bill rate dropped below 5 percent on a
variety of factors, including end-of-the-quarter demand.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury prices fell early in the session after the Commerce
Department said gross domestic product increased at a seasonally
adjusted 5.4 percent annual rate in the first quarter, much higher
than its estimate of 4.8 percent a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management,
said ``despite still-booming home sales, the somewhat surprising,
upward revised 5.4 percent GDP, statistic, while subject to further
change with next month's annual revisions, certainly demonstrated
the economy's torrid expansion during the first quarter was likely
to slow substantially, due mainly to an inventory overhang.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Furthermore,'' he said, ``economic activity seems to be
encountering some head winds at the onset of the third quarter in
the forms of sagging durable goods orders, the GM strike, and an
ever-widening trade deficit.''
</P>
<P>
   Fine said he expected that Federal Reserve policy makers would
keep monetary policy unchanged at its two-day meeting next week
because of benign inflation, a growing budget surplus, strong
dollar and continued turmoil in Asia.

FOR NEW YORK'S TEAMS, IT'S PLAY BALL! BUT WHAT'S THE COST? 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If the heavens cooperate Friday night, two teams will
gather on a swath of Queens County grass to demonstrate how the
game of baseball has particularly blessed New York City this year
with talent and character.
</P>
<P>
   An umpire will shout a familiar demand, a Mets pitcher will fire
a baseball to a Yankees batter, and all will be right in one corner
of an ever-churning metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   As they say from Queens Boulevard to the Bronx River Parkway:
Yeah, right. If you want ``Field of Dreams'' fantasies, buddy, go
chase flies in some sandlot.
</P>
<P>
   The current issues and historic emotions woven through this
weekend's three-game series at Shea Stadium go far beyond the
typical smell-the-cut-grass baseball blather. There are fortunes at
stake here, as well as a borough's identity.
</P>
<P>
   There are the dueling political futures of a mayor and a city
council speaker at risk. There are two owners who chuckle through
gritted teeth and say that no rivalry exists. And there are the
fans who want nothing more than the right to brag.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain teams where the players really hate each
other,'' said David Halberstam, the author, who has written
extensively about sports. ``But this is a rivalry built up by the
fans. It's about who rules New York. Who rules the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, whose fashion sense permits him on
occasion to wear a Yankee warmup jacket and cap, said that he does
not even bother pretending that he likes both teams equally.
</P>
<P>
   ``One, it would be dishonest,'' he said. ``Two, I wouldn't get
away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time that the Mets and the Yankees are
encouraging the rivalry by playing some of the best baseball in the
major leagues, they are also seeking public subsidies in the
hundreds of millions of dollars to finance new ballparks.
</P>
<P>
   This has residents of their host city pondering answers to a
couple of questions: At what price baseball? And can New York,
given the shifts in everything from the economics of the sport to
the demographics of the city, continue to support two teams?
</P>
<P>
   Both teams see new stadiums as essential to their survival. The
Mets want an old-style park to be built alongside Shea that would
bring back eye-watering memories of Brooklyn's Ebbets Field but
sport the futuristic touches of a retractable dome and a
removable-grass playing field. The Yankees want to abandon the
Bronx landmark of Yankee Stadium for a ballpark on the West Side of
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the majestic skyline looming behind center field, Yankee
types say, their eyes as wide as silver dollars. And if you can't,
imagine the Yankees in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The public debate over the two proposals has been closer to a
hollering match between competing beer vendors than a dispassionate
evaluation on merit.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, the city council, the city's teachers, self-styled
defenders of good government and a medley of political candidates
and gadflies have all waxed apoplectic on the subject. It's enough
to make the musings of former Gov. Mario Cuomo _ who also made a
cameo appearance in the debate _ seem touchingly quaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to see guys who chew and never smile,'' said Cuomo,
himself a former minor-league ballplayer. ``And when they take off
their hat they're bald _ and they don't care. I love the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Through it all the Mets and the Yankees have provided more than
enough moments, from the bravura to the bizarre, to help explain
the sellout crowds for this year's series, the second since
baseball instituted interleague play last year _ when the American
League Yankees won two of three from the National League Mets. In
that, they also offer some hope that baseball just might be able to
transcend city politics.
</P>
<P>
   Take Orlando Hernandez, who fled Cuba on a sailboat the day
after Christmas, spent a few days on a deserted island before being
rescued, and is now pitching for the Yankees with a poise that
suggests he commutes in from upscale Scarsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Or Rick Reed, the Mets pitcher who was ostracized for crossing
the picket line during a strike in 1995, but whose pitching
excellence has won over his colleagues. Or that day in May when the
Mets pulled off an old-fashioned blockbuster trade, acquiring Mike
Piazza, the all-star catcher.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there is David Wells, the Yankees pitcher with
the longshoreman's physique who once nearly came to blows with the
team's owner, George Steinbrenner. Last month he pitched a perfect
game, winning one for big lugs everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But the whiff of politics, not pretzels, envelops New York
baseball this year, and Wells' rare feat could not enter posterity
unmarked. Giuliani immediately arranged to present Wells with the
key to the city.
</P>
<P>
   The one person specifically not invited to the City Hall event
was Peter Vallone, speaker of the City Council, candidate for
governor and stubborn proponent of the notion that the city's
voters ought to decide the fate of Yankee Stadium. Thus the snub
had nothing to do with the speaker's Queens roots, and everything
to do with stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani administration feels that it cannot risk calling
Steinbrenner's bluff when he says that Yankee Stadium is too old
and inconvenient for the team to remain financially competitive. A
beam that fell from the stadium's rafters earlier this year
provided punctuation to that point of view.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner has once again invoked his often-broken vow of
silence on the matter. Howard Rubenstein, his spokesman, said
Steinbrenner is studying the matter and will announce in the fall
``where he wants the stadium to be: that's the West Side, the
Bronx, or New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   Sophisticated enough to recognize Steinbrenner's broad hints
that the Bronx will no longer do, the mayor raised the possibility
_ the conclusion, his critics say _ of dropping a stadium onto a
railbed along a moribund stretch of Manhattan's West Side.
</P>
<P>
   He also proposed using the revenues of a business tax to pay for
the city's share of new stadiums for both the Yankees and the Mets,
and talked about the economic boost that would follow. And he
shrugged off allegations of being a Steinbrenner sycophant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would react the same way to the Mets and the stock
exchange,'' Giuliani said this week. ``It's purely business. I
don't conceive it as my job as the mayor to lose valuable New York
institutions. My job as the mayor is to get the public
understanding what is at stake, so they don't let emotions get in
the way of things that would be good for the city five or ten years
from now.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even so, baseball in New York was no longer just about hitting
and pitching.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican mayor's proposal angered Vallone, a Democrat who
also happens to be running for governor. The speaker quickly framed
the debate in populist terms: the rich owner benefiting at the
expense of the taxpayer; the struggling Bronx losing out to
glittering Manhattan; the arrogant mayor ignoring the will of the
people.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone proposed a referendum on a Manhattan stadium, Giuliani
vowed to block it _ and suddenly the cordial deliberations between
the mayor and the council over the city's surplus budget became a
sort of screaming match between dysfunctional family members over a
Thanksgiving meal.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball, in a sense, led the City Council to adopt its own
budget, in unprecedented defiance of the mayor. Baseball, in a
sense, now could lead to cuts in city funding for nonprofit
agencies, as a result of the budgetary crossfire.
</P>
<P>
   A recent radio commercial, paid for by the City Council's
political committee, used the familiar sound of a bat hitting a
ball to support the message that Little League _ not the Yankees _
had become ``part of the budget battle, the Giuliani administration
vs. your City Council, and your children.''
</P>
<P>
   And the other night the council held a public forum called
``Take Me Out to the New Ballpark,'' at which the 30-odd audience
members applauded any criticism of Giuliani and Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools are falling apart! Plaster is falling on students, but
that doesn't seem to bother Mayor Giuliani,'' cried a teacher from
the Upper West Side. ``We need to build new schools.''
</P>
<P>
   All because of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo, who generally supports the West Side proposal, said that
earlier this year he had urged the Yankees to tread carefully into
the turbulent world of public opinion. He said he had suggested the
team take several months to research the West Side proposal, and
then develop a clear-cut plan to the city _ after the fall's
gubernatorial elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you need is consensus,'' he said. ``If you don't have it,
the politicians won't agree with it. And politicians do nothing
that the polls say you don't want done.''
</P>
<P>
   The former governor's voice trailed off in disgust. ``I'm so
aggravated by what's happening here,'' he said. ``This is the
classic prescribed device for arriving at the wrong conclusions:
Start by ignoring the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   While Steinbrenner finds himself trying to downplay this year's
spike in attendance at Yankee Stadium, the Mets organization
quietly awaits city approval for a plan that, when compared to the
Yankees' desires, comes off as just another capital project.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Wilpon, the team's co-owner, said that the new stadium
would have better views of the ballfields, better concessions, and
other amenities that would encourage fans to return more often.
</P>
<P>
   And Jay Horowitz, the team's spokesman, sees a distinct and
elemental link between the quality of the team's play and
attendance. The Mets drew 3 million people when it won the World
Series in 1986, a number they matched by making the playoffs in
1987; since then, mediocrity has led to a plummet in attendance, to
1.7 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've really turned it around the last two years, and we're in
an upswing,'' he said. ``It's a cyclical thing: when you play well,
you draw, and when you don't play well, you don't draw.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, the Yankees-Mets game draws big. But Steinbrenner
will not be in attendance for any of the three games at Shea. Prior
commitments require his presence in Tampa. &QL;

 &HT;    BellSouth unfazed by AT&AMP;T's likely inroads with mega-deal
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- BellSouth is betting that it will take years for AT&AMP;T
to realize the benefits from its purchase of the nation's
second-largest cable television company.
</P>
<P>
   The $48 billion deal to buy Tele-Communications Inc. could give
the long-distance company a direct link to millions of homes, as
AT&AMP;T offers Internet, phone, video and data services to business,
as well as consumers. But by the time, AT&AMP;T _ and other rivals _
get to where they want to be, BellSouth hopes to be somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the things you are seeing confirm the strategic view
BellSouth has had for several years,'' said Earle Mauldin,
president of BellSouth Enterprises, the unit that includes wireless
service, international operations and publishing. ``We are at the
front of the pack and we intend to stay in front of the pack.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years after passage of the Telecommunications Act, there is
little competition in local service. But AT&AMP;T this week gave clear
notice of plans to join the fray _ along with WorldCom and perhaps
others. When that happens, BellSouth will be facing rivals that are
not only larger, but are likely to offer a potent range of
services.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, BellSouth is lagging in the marketing of high-speed
data lines to business, a market where it has already lost
customers, said analyst Jeff Sadler of Robinson-Humphrey. ``That is
really the missing strategy. To defend yourself, you are going to
need the full quiver and they don't have that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, BellSouth has in recent years branched out from its core
business in local phones to provide wireless service and Internet
access, as well as wireless delivery of cable television in New
Orleans and Atlanta. BellSouth this summer plans a roll-out of
digital subscriber lines _ DSL _ a high-speed alternative to cable
company modems that runs over regular phone lines. But DSL cannot
be delivered to all homes. And wireless cable cannot reach anyone
whose transmitter reception is blocked. Meanwhile, BellSouth's
trials of interactive cable remain quiet and limited.
</P>
<P>
   No company can use one route to reach all customers, Mauldin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, BellSouth has ``a targeted but ambitious'' plan to
expand its fiber optic lines, and is considering a partnership with
a satellite company that could fill the gaps in BellSouth cable
offerings, Mauldin said. ``We are investing in a variety of
approaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts expect competitors to ``bundle'' services
together, luring customers with the convenience of one-stop
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   What BellSouth lacks most conspicuously for a full bundle is the
right to offer long-distance _ a privilege it hopes to win from
federal regulators this year. BellSouth will argue that AT&AMP;T's
promise to compete in local service is another reason to grant that
right.

 &HT;    State lab tests will confirm disease source
 &HT;    By Diane Lore and M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Thirteen children _ nine from Georgia and four from
out-of-state _ have been confirmed as infected with E. coli as part
of an outbreak linked to a Cobb County water park, public health
officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But ``several'' other children may also be infected, according
to Joyce Goldberg, spokeswoman for the state Division of Public
Health. ``I don't want to talk any specific numbers because in some
cases the evidence has been very weak and in other cases it's been
very strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the confirmed cases, two are from Tennessee, one is from
Arizona and one is from Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the 13 cases have been proven to have the same genetic
signature as the strain of E. coli O157:H7 that appears to have
been spread through a kiddie pool area at the White Water amusement
park two weeks ago, Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   It will take at least two weeks for public health workers to
confirm whether all the cases belong to the outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   Bacteria that have been cultured from the sick and identified as
O157:H7 will undergo a third level of analysis to see if they match
the genetic fingerprint of bacteria found in stool samples linked
to the White Water outbreak. Those tests will be performed at the
new DPH lab on Clairmont Road near Decatur and confirmed by back-up
tests at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ``A child can have clinical disease consistent with E. coli
O157:H7, but it may not be E. coli, it may not be O157:H7, and it
may not be the strain associated with White Water at all,'' said
Mel Ralston, a CDC public health advisor working with the state.
``So it's important for us to know.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the state is leading the investigation and has not
formally asked the CDC for help. CDC has, however, alerted other
state health departments through an e-mail network of the local
cases and asked them to send bacteria they isolate from patients to
regional labs or the CDC for analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The agency hopes to use a new network, called PulseNet, that
allows electronic comparison of the genetic fingerprints of
different bacteria. Those results could provide the final
definition of how far the outbreak reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``PulseNet can connect by phone line what's a match and what is
not,'' said CDC spokesperson Barbara Reynolds. ``It also sends out
alarms when there is a match. With PulseNet, we can really define
an outbreak better.''
</P>
<P>
   That precision is necessary because the cases now being looked
at could be E.coli 0157:H7 but have no relation to White Water. For
instance, two hospitalized sisters, aged 2 and 6, who were among
the first children found to be infected, have been confirmed as
O157:H7 cases but also have been proven to have no connection to
the park.
</P>
<P>
   It may never be clear who is responsible for the infection. It
may not be any of the children who are now infected, but rather a
child whose illness had not been noticed by parents or who showed
no symptoms at all. It's also possible, though less likely, that a
teen or adult who took a toddler into the pool could have been the
first case that caused the outbreak, Ralston said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, more than 1,000 calls have been logged at the state's
E. coli hotline, although Goldberg said the volume dropped slightly
Thursday. ``Our folks were able to take a little bit of a
breather,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At White Water park, attendance was only about 2,300 by 1:30
Thursday, a hot day in mid-season at an attraction that averages
6,000 to 8,000 vistors a day, according to figures released by park
officials.
</P>
<P>
   But new rules implemented did not have a serious effect on
operations, said park spokeswoman Deedie Dowdle. The park announced
Wednesday it will turn away children under the age of 4 who come
with groups such as day care centers or summer camps, but no one
was turned away Thursday, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another new policy requires children under the age of 3 to wear
plastic pants in the pools, and park officials said Wednesday that
the pants will be given to youngsters who come to the park without
them at no charge. About 30 plastic pants were handed out Thursday,
said Dowdle, who said most of the families who come to the park
already have them for the children that need them.
</P>
<P>
   The number of calls from season ticket holders asking about
refunds on their tickets was up around 100, a park manager said
Thursday. Park officials said Wednesday they had received about
eight such calls, and expressed their belief that most season
ticket holders will remain patrons of the water park. Officials
declined to say whether any season ticket holder had received a
refund.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, pool owners _ concerned about the safety of their
private and community pools _ were buying chlorine in an effort to
keep the water clean.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had more people coming in wondering how to keep (E.
coli) down,'' said Jennifer Wood, chemistry and sales for JC Pool
Supplies Inc. in Morrow.
</P>
<P>
   Seven children with confirmed E. coli infections remained
Thursday at metro Atlanta hospitals, although it was still unclear
which of the cases were related to White Water.
</P>
<P>
   Four children were at Scottish Rite Children's Medical Center.
Two girls, ages 2 and 4, were in critical condition. Braves
shortstop Walt Weiss's son, Brody, 3, was in serious condition. A
5-year-old boy was in good condition. Scottish Rite staffers were
caring for a fifth child with suspected E. coli infection, but that
child's lab tests had not come back yet Thursday, said hospital
spokeswoman Staci Flaxer.
</P>
<P>
   At Egleston Children's Hospital, three children with E. coli
infections were in good condition Thursday evening. Two sisters,
ages 2 and 6, were not infected at White Water park. They were
admitted to the hospital June 6, five days before officials believe
a park pool was contaminated with E. coli-laden feces, said
hospital spokeswoman Debbie Osborne. The other Egleston patient, a
3-year-old boy, apparently was infected at the swimming pool.

   MEXICO-CHICANOS _ MEXICO CITY _ The National Association for

the first time, bringing together people on both sides of the
border who are linked by heritage yet often mutually misunderstood.
The June 24-27 meeting reflects Chicanos' fascination with Mexico's
Zapatista rebels, as well as scholars' ample research on
immigration, machismo, political power and gay identities. Also of
interest: the cultural similarities and differences between
Chicanos and Mexicans. At a press conference for Mexican
journalists to promote the conference, one cultural clash emerged
right from the start: Why, a puzzled journalist asked, was the
conference going to be held mostly in English? Don't Chicanos speak

COURT STRIKES DOWN PRESIDENT'S LINE-ITEM VETO POWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court, in a historic ruling affecting
the constitutional balance of power at the heart of the American
political system, struck down legislation Thursday that permits the
president to veto specific provisions of spending and tax bills.
</P>
<P>
   The court's 6-3 decision against the practice, known as the
``line-item veto,'' restores the historic balance between the
legislative and executive branches, removing from the president's
political arsenal a weapon that Congress provided in 1996 and that
President Clinton used 82 times last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court, especially sensitive to the separation of
powers because of its own institutional role, took the unusual step
of noting it did ``not lightly'' reach its conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the majority, said the
issue was of ``profound importance.'' The court, Stevens wrote,
``has concluded that its duty is clear,'' and the line-item veto is
``not authorized by the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the line-item veto was provided to a Democratic president
by a Republican Congress, the ability to strike out individual
provisions of bills is a prerogative given to 43 of the nation's
governors, sought 130 years ago by President Ulysses S. Grant and
desired by every modern president since Harry Truman. In a
statement released by the White House, President Clinton said he
was ``deeply disappointed'' by the ruling, which he characterized
as ``a defeat for all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision, however, was hailed by constitutional
traditionalists, especially those on Capitol Hill who guard
congressional prerogatives, who argued that the line-item veto
represented an erosion of legislative powers by permitting a
president to pick and choose among congressional spending
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great day, a great day for the United States of
America, a great day for the Constitution of the United States,''
said Senator Robert C. Byrd, a West Virginia Democrat who has
opposed the line-item veto for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Many Supreme Court decisions set off ripples that disturb the
pond of politics, but this ruling will shape the political
environment in Washington intimately for years to come. Thursday's
ruling, coming on the next-to-last day of the high court's term,
will affect not only legislative strategy but also legislative
content, making it even more tempting for lawmakers to add special
or local-interest provisions into spending bills. Its influence
will be felt immediately this summer, as the 13 appropriations
bills make their slow passage from subcommittee all the way to the
president's desk.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, moreover, provides a window into the high court's
view of the relationship between the other two branches of
government. It affirms the very first word of the first sentence of
the first section of the first article of the Constitution, where
the framers wrote: ``All legislative powers herein granted shall be
vested in a Congress of the United States. ...''
</P>
<P>
   The court struck down the measure by citing a clause deeper in
the Constitution, where the framers stipulated that ``every bill''
that passed the House and Senate shall ``be presented'' to the
president, who can sign it into law or return it to Congress if he
objects. The court found that the line-item veto violated this
``Presentment Clause,'' and the historical record provides
``abundant support'' for the notion that there should be no
deviation from the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is to be a new procedure in which the president will
play a different role in determining the text of what may `become a
law,' such change must come not by legislation but through the
amendment procedures set forth in Article V of the Constitution,''
Stevens wrote. He was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist
and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter, Clarence Thomas
and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Dissenting were Justices Antonin Scalia,
Sandra Day O'Connor and Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia, writing for the dissenters, argued that the true intent
of the line-item veto law was misread by the court majority. ``The
title...designed to simplify... or perhaps merely comply with the
terms of a campaign pledge, has succeeded in faking out the Supreme
Court,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The line-item veto struck down Thursday allowed a president to
sign a statute into law, but then, within five days, cancel certain
items in the legislation. Congress could in turn reinstate the item
by passing a separate bill, which it did in 38 of the instances in
which Clinton exercised the power.
</P>
<P>
   The court, however, found that the ``Presentment Clause'' was
crafted in a deliberate fashion. Constitutional scholars believe
the framers intended both houses of Congress and the president to
approve any law, a slow process that nonetheless frustrates
factional interests.
</P>
<P>
   The court's ruling in effect establishes, or restores, a
firewall between the law-making function of Congress and the final
approval function of the president. ``This legislative process was
deemed so fundamental to our freedoms that the court didn't want to
allow an exception, even for what might be deemed a lovable purpose
like cutting federal spending,'' said David Schoenbrod, a law
professor at the New York Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, in adopting the legislation, tried to get around the
``Presentment Clause'' by saying the president actually signed
bills into law and, then, separately, went back and canceled
specific budget and tax items.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a highly formalistic approach, and the court saw
through it,'' said Kate Stith-Cabranes, a Yale Law School expert on
legislation. ``This really is a line-item veto, and it was not
contemplated by the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the line-item veto announced they would
immediately offer legislation to circumvent the justices' decision
by requiring each spending item approved by Congress to be listed
as a separate bill for the president's signature or veto.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen years ago, the justices prohibited a similar
aggrandizement of power beyond those expressly mentioned in the
Constitution, though that time, Congress benefitted instead of the
president. That ruling, made in 1983, struck down a law permitting
either House of Congress to veto some executive branch decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The line-item veto was apppealed to the Supreme Court shortly
after it was approved by Congress, but the justices threw out the
case, saying that the plaintiffs _ Byrd and Senator Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, the New York Democrat, and then-Senator Mark O. Hatfield,
the Oregon Republican _ didn't have standing for their complaint.
At the time, the justices said the senators' suit was largely a
theoretical exercise since they were not harmed. The justices
ruling Thursday grew out of challenges to the law filed by parties
in Idaho and New York directly harmed by specific line-item vetoes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, &UR;  &LR; however, it is clear that the line-item veto has resulted
in a significant shift in the balance of power to the president,
changing the way lawmakers sought funding for favored spending
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The impetus to create a line-item veto came less from politics
than from economics, and the momentum gathered force as the federal
budget deficit grew in the 1980s and the early 1990s. In the past
as in modern times, its earliest adherants viewed it as a tool of
thrift. In his landmark commentary on American government written
110 years ago, Lord Bryce said the line-item veto was ``desired by
enlightened men'' and would ``save the nation millions of dollars a
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who criticized Thursday's ruling, including Clinton,
emphasized the line-item veto's role in keeping government
efficient and inexpensive. ``The line-item veto act was a vital
force in restoring the appropriate balance of power, and
eliminating wasteful, unnecessary pork-barrel spending,'' said
Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. ``Unfortunately,
pork-barrel spending is alive and well.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is Clinton v. City of New York, 97-1374.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ People with HIV infection can be covered by the
federal law that bars discrimination on the basis of disability
even if they have no symptoms, the Supreme Court ruled Thursday in
a major victory for people with the virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Voting 5-4, the justices agreed with a federal appeals court's
ruling that a woman with asymptomatic HIV infection, who was
refused care in a dentist's office, met the definition of
disability under the Americans With Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   The court stopped short of ruling flatly that HIV infection is
automatically covered by the disability law, a question that
Justice Anthony Kennedy's majority opinion said was not necessary
to the decision. There is no dispute that people with AIDS symptoms
are disabled within the meaning of the 1990 law.
</P>
<P>
   The majority held that the woman's decision not to have children
because of her HIV-positive status brought her within the law's
definition of disability: an impairment that ``substantially
limits'' one or more ``major life activities.'' Reproduction is
such an activity, Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the opinion's scope was limited, its tone suggested
that in subsequent cases, all or almost all HIV-positive people
would be able to claim the law's protection. ``Major life
activities'' is a broad phrase that should be broadly interpreted
in light of the prospect of inevitable progression to a ``dread and
fatal disease,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond its application to the nearly 1 million people in the
United States who are HIV positive, the decision was important as
the court's first substantive review of the 8-year-old disability
law.
</P>
<P>
   The court's analysis suggested that the law would also cover
other conditions that some lower courts have regarded as beyond its
scope, including infertility, well-controlled diabetes and cancer
that is in remission after treatment. Kennedy said it was not
necessary for a life activity that is compromised by an impairment
to have a ``public, economic or daily character.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority opinion was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens,
David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer. Chief Justice
William Rehnquist dissented, as did Justices Antonin Scalia,
Clarence Thomas and Sandra Day O'Connor. The dissenters said that
reproduction was not a major life activity and that in any event
the ability to have a child was not ``substantially limited'' by
HIV infection in the way the law used that phrase.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, Brandon vs. Abbott, No. 97-156, was short of a
complete victory for the patient, Sidney Abbott, who brought the
lawsuit in 1994. After finding that she was covered by the law, the
1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals went on to rule that despite his
fear of infection, the dentist, Randon Bragdon, had illegally
discriminated against her by refusing to treat her in his office,
in Bangor, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The justices vacated that final part of the ruling however,
ordering the appeals court, which sits in Boston, to take further
evidence on the question of risk. The disability act provides an
exception under which a person with an infectious condition need
not be treated if the condition ``poses a direct threat to the
health or safety of others,'' defined as a ``significant risk''
that cannot be eliminated by appropriate procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said that within the scope of this appeal, the Supreme
Court had not been able to review evidence on this question. He
said such evidence should be limited to ``objective, scientific
information,'' in particular the views of public health
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   This in itself was an important part of the ruling, because the
court rejected Bragdon's argument that the judgment of risk could
be made by the individual medical practitioner. Bragdon's personal
views should receive ``no special deference simply because he is a
health care professional,'' Kennedy said, adding that ``his belief
that a significant risk existed, even if maintained in good faith,
would not relieve him from liability'' if broadly accepted medical
evidence was to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Ms. Abbott said they were confident they would
prevail in the renewed lower court proceedings, in light of the
views of leading public health authorities on the safety of
treating HIV-positive patients and the absence of evidence that any
patient had ever transmitted HIV infection to a dentist.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, which entered the case in support of
Ms. Abbott, told the court that the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention had ``found the risk of HIV transmission in the dental
context so low as to be unquantifiable.''
</P>
<P>
   In his dissenting opinion, however, Rehnquist said that given
evidence that patients had transmitted the virus to health care
workers on 42 documented occasions, it was likely that Bragdon
could establish that it was ``objectively reasonable'' for him to
refuse to treat an infected patient in his office.
</P>
<P>
   The dentist had offered to fill Ms. Abbott's cavity in a
hospital, where in fact he did not have privileges to practice. It
was at that point that she filed suit.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Her lawyer, Bennett Klein of Gay and Lesbian Advocates and
Defenders, a Boston public interest law firm, said he was
``elated'' by the decision, which he said would send a strong
signal to lower courts that all HIV-positive people are protected
under the law.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990 law offers broad protection against discrimination on
the basis of disability in employment and places of public
accommodation, which are defined as including medical offices. A
related law, the National Fair Housing Act Amendments of 1988, uses
the same definition of disability to prohibit discrimination in
housing.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Coles, director of the AIDS Project of the American
Civil Liberties Union, said the decision was important in
demonstrating that the court was willing to look at ``the basic
purpose of the Americans With Disabilities Act.'' Contrary to many
narrow lower court interpretations, Coles said, the law was
intended to be read ``not like an antitrust regulation but like a
civil rights law.''
</P>
<P>
   Ann Elizabeth Reesman, a lawyer here who filed a brief on behalf
of an employer group urging the court to reject reproduction as a
``major life activity,'' said the ruling had significantly
broadened the scope of the law. Employers will most likely find the
decision troublesome, she said, because ``reproduction is such a
broad term that it will be more difficult to tell who is covered
and what employers' obligations are.''

TEXAS TOWN PUTS OUT UNWELCOME MAT FOR KKK, NEW BLACK PANTHERS

<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ They call their town the ``Jewel of the
Forest,'' and Chamber of Commerce officials usually are eager to
lure visitors. City leaders tout the fat bass in area lakes, the
beauty of the local forests and the quaint bed-and-breakfasts.
</P>
<P>
   But this weekend, locals are sending out a different message:
``Stay away.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the 8,000 townsfolk are putting out the unwelcome
mat for several Ku Klux Klan, New Black Panther and Muslim groups
that are planning to converge on the east Texas town Saturday to
rally on the tree-shaded lawn in front of Jasper's picturesque
109-year-old courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they cure all the problems in Dallas and it's safe for me
to walk the streets of Dallas, then they can come down here and
tell me what to do about Jasper,'' said George Miller, the
administrator of Jasper Memorial Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who is black, made that comment about the New Black
Panthers of Dallas. But he had the same sentiments for Klan groups
from the Texas cities of Vidor and Waco, and as far away as Georgia
who have announced plans to be in Jasper on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   KKK members say they're coming to express condemnation for the
June 7 murder of a 49-year-old black man, allegedly at the hands of
three white men who are accused of dragging him behind a pickup for
almost three miles along back country roads.
</P>
<P>
   Black militant groups say they'll be in Jasper to protest the
KKK and to protect local blacks from Klan members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We respect their right to congregate,'' said Muslim leader
Quanell X of Houston. ``But if they step out of line with one black
person, we'll be there to put them in check.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he will bring a group of black Muslims from Houston. A
group from the New Black Panther Party of Dallas announced it will
be on hand as well. The protesters, Quanell X said, will be armed
``with legal firearms,'' and plan to come into town ``right along
side the Ku Klux Klan.''
</P>
<P>
   A KKK spokesman said that while the Klan groups don't plan to
make a display of weapons, ``I am sure some members will have legal
firearms with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that, several hundred lawmen _ from local officers and
those from neighboring cities and counties to FBI agents, Texas
Rangers and state troopers _ will be on duty. One local businessman
said police informed downtown merchants that the streets around the
main square will be cordoned off.
</P>
<P>
   Officials aren't talking about their preparations publicly. But
about 200 officers were in Jasper, a city with a police force of
about 14 officers, two weeks ago when armed Black Panthers from
Dallas marched after the funeral of murder victim James Byrd Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be at least that many here Saturday,'' said Jasper
County District Attorney Guy James Gray.
</P>
<P>
   The real reason the Klan and militant groups are coming to
Jasper, said Sheriff Billy Rowles, is to get in front of all the
news cameras that have been in Jasper since Byrd's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you all would just go away,'' Rowles told members of the
news media this week, ``they would stay away. Jasper needs to have
time to heal.''
</P>
<P>
   That message was repeated throughout the community, about 140
miles northeast of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they think at least two of the men charged
with Byrd's killing may have ties to the Aryan Brotherhood, a
prison-based white supremacist group, or to Klan groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jewish-controlled liberal press has attempted to assign
blame and responsibility to the Ku Klux Klan and/or another Aryan
organization,'' the Vidor-based Knights of the White Kamellia said
on its Internet homepage. ``The truth is, neither the Klan nor any
other white organization would have anything to gain by such a
senseless act of unnecessary violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lowe, leader of a Klan faction based in Waco, said that
while the Klan condemns Byrd's murder, some question whether it was
a hate crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Byrd was an ex-felon,'' Lowe said. ``It might be a drug
deal gone wrong, not just a hate crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have said they see no indication that Byrd's death
involved drugs. Officials have characterized it as a random hate
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jasper's leaders, both white and black, said they
hope there is nobody around the county square Saturday to hear the
Klan and black militants except each other, law officers and the
media.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're encouraging everybody to stay away,'' said the Rev.
Bobby Hudson, an African-American pastor of Goodwill Baptist
Church. ``You've got to have somebody there to argue with, and we
don't want to give them anybody to argue with.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Billy Mahathay, proprietor of Billy's Old Fashion  &UR;  &LR; Barbecue,
agreed. ``I think that the Black Panthers and the Klan both need to
stay where they come from,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't raised like that,'' he added, looking at
photographs of he and his black sister and brother playing with
white friends as children. ``Jasper just isn't like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Snelson, past president of the Jasper Chamber of Commerce,
called Byrd's murder ``a cruel and savage atrocity committed by
misfits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We view this tragic incident as the difference between good
and evil, between right and wrong,'' he said. ``Not between white
and black.''
</P>
<P>
   Most citizens and public officials said they know of no
organized Klan groups in their county, but the Knights of the White
Kamellia Internet page claims otherwise. ``We have had a Klavern in
Jasper County since 1996 and will kontinue be active there,'' it
said.
</P>
<P>
   If so, most residents apparently find the group, which calls
itself part of the ``Invisible Empire,'' just that _ invisible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lived here all my life,'' said Edith Lewis, 49, who is
white, ``and I've never seen the Klan. I saw the Black Panthers for
the first time the other day. I was not impressed.''

COURT REJECTS STARR EFFORT TO OBTAIN FOSTER-RELATED NOTES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Supreme Court Thursday rebuffed Independent Counsel Kenneth
W. Starr's effort to obtain notes taken by a lawyer for a
now-deceased White House aide, ruling that conversations between
attorneys and their clients should be protected beyond the grave.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-3 decision, which was watched closely by the Clinton
administration and the legal community, overturned an appeals court
decision that sided with Starr. The high court said Starr's
argument was not persuasive enough to justify narrowing the
nation's oldest legal privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Starr wanted the court to force James Hamilton, the attorney for
Deputy White House Counsel Vincent W. Foster, to turn over three
pages of notes he took in 1993, nine days before Foster committed
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the majority in the first federal test of posthumous
attorney-client privilege, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said,
``It has been generally, if not universally, accepted for well over
a century, that the attorney-client privilege survives the death of
the client in a case such as this.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton hailed the ruling as as ``victory for the legal
profession. This case in importance transcended the facts of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr, in a written statement, said, ``Although we are
disappointed in the outcome of the Supreme Court's decision, we
understand and respect the care and expedition with which the Court
resolved the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr added, ``The issue has obviously proved to be of
considerable difficulty, as the divided opinions of the Supreme
Court and the Court of Appeals reveal. In all events, we continue
to pursue our investigations as thoroughly and expeditiously as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials are trying to sort out the ruling's
implications on Starr's effort to require Clinton confidant Bruce
Lindsey to testify about his conversations with the president in
the early days of the Monica Lewinsky investigation. The White
House has argued attorney-client privilege in that case, which is
currently moving through the appeals courts.
</P>
<P>
   One administration official called Thursday's ruling a
``setback'' for Starr. A White House official traveling with
President Clinton in China called it ``an important validation of
the vital issue of attorney-client privilege.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr was seeking Hamilton's notes to help determine whether
Clinton aides commited perjury, obstructed justice or committed
other crimes in connection with Hillary Rodham Clinton's role in
the 1993 dismissal of employees from the White House travel office.
</P>
<P>
   She has said she had no role in the firings, but a draft memo by
a former White House aide given to Whitewater investigators in 1996
portrays her as being behind the dismissals. The memo also says
that Foster spoke to Hillary Clinton about the travel office issue.
</P>
<P>
   Starr subpoeaned Hamilton in December 1995 for the handwritten
notes he took during a two-hour meeting with Foster on July 11,
1993. Foster had come to him for legal represenation over the
dismissals in the travel office. Nine days later Foster was found
dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in a park in suburban
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton resisted the subpoena, and the appeals court later
ruled that the attorney-client privilege of confidentiality should
be waived when the information is important to a criminal case.
</P>
<P>
   But the Supreme Court said there was no case law holding that
the privilege applies differently in criminal and civil cases, and
that a client may not know when disclosing information to an
attorney whether it will later be relevant to a civil or criminal
matter.
</P>
<P>
   The case grabbed the attention of the legal community, with the
American Bar Association, National Association of Criminal Defense
Lawyers, American Corporate Counsel Association and National
Hospice Organization, all arguing that the legal privilege should
extend after a client's death. Ending that long-established rule
would be chilling to a lawyer's relationship with a client.
</P>
<P>
   While Rehnquist said Starr's arguments against the posthumous
privilege were not ``frivolous,'' he said Starr simply had not
satisified his burden of showing that ``reason and experience''
require the rule to be broken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing that communications will remain confidential even
after death serves a weighty interest in encouraging a client to
communicate fully and frankly with counsel; posthumous disclosure
of such communications may be as feared as disclosure during the
client's lifetime,'' the court said.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, Anthony M.
Kennedy, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G.
Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Those dissenting were Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin
Scalia and Clarence Thomas. In the dissent, O'Connor wrote: ``In my
view, a criminal defendant's right to exculpatory evidence or a
compelling law enforcement need for information may, where the
testimony is not avaialble from other sources, overrride a client's
posthumous interest in confidentiality.''
</P>
<P>
   John Q. Barrett, a criminal law professor at St. John's
University School of Law and former associate counsel to the
Iran-Contra special prosecutor, Lawrence E. Walsh, said if the
ruling had gone the other way, the case would have minimal impact,
despite rhetoric about the horrors that would result from narrowing
attorney-client privilege. ``There just aren't many prosecutors who
happen to need something that happens to be in the hands of a
lawyer whose client has died,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the decision will likely end efforts to seek
long-sealed papers in the 106-year-old case of Lizzie Borden, who
was prosecuted but acquitted of the hatchet murders of her parents.
The notes of Borden's defense lawyer, George Robinson, are locked
in the offices of the Springfield, Mass., law firm he founded.

COMMENTARY: SCEPTER'D ISLE SENDS ENVOYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By RUSSELL BAKER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ No, I am not shocked by news that writers for The
Boston Globe and The New Republic have been serving up fiction
dressed as fact.
</P>
<P>
   They shouldn't have done it. Of course not. But let the truth be
said: Few forms of human activity lend themselves so readily to
fakery as journalism.
</P>
<P>
   There is, to begin with, the tradition of the ``source.'' The
``source'' must be protected at all costs. Rather than tell anyone
who the ``source'' is, the reporter must be willing to hang
shackled to dungeon walls or do time on a chain gang.
</P>
<P>
   Betraying a ``source'' is as unspeakable as a New York cop
telling investigators which of his colleagues beat the prisoners
with knouts and horsewhips. Betraying a ``source'' is to dishonor
the profession, as journalists are apt to miscall their trade when
they assemble to be solemn about themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a profession, of course. The journalist is always a
hired hand, and there is always a boss who can have his head at a
whim if angry enough to challenge the journalist's union.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the journalist has something akin to a code of ethics,
and one ironbound rule is that a ``source'' must never be betrayed.
The problem about ``sources'' is that, because their existence is
known only to the journalist, it is possible for them not to exist
at all.
</P>
<P>
   The tradition makes the news business vulnerable to the
unscrupulous and the lazy. There are plenty like that in all lines
of work, journalism included.
</P>
<P>
   When the competition becomes murderous, as in the Monica
Lewinsky story, for instance, the temptation to invent ``sources''
can obviously lead to perdition for a reporter with an insecure
boss leaning on him to produce something ... anything ... fast!
</P>
<P>
   What we are talking about is simply cheating. You encounter a
lot of it every day in many a realm; why suppose that the
percentage of it among journalists is lower?
</P>
<P>
   ``Scoop,'' Evelyn Waugh's classic and hilarious satire on
journalism, supposes an utterly unprincipled business in which
fakery is a way of life. In ``Scoop,'' everything is fraudulent,
including the hero, an innocent nature lover forced to pass himself
off as an ace war correspondent because of a stupid publisher and
cynical editors.
</P>
<P>
   Waugh's reporters file three- and four-word messages from a
primitive jungle state with a war in progress. These are expanded
by editors in London into sensational accounts of events that
didn't happen. The competition is incredible and everybody
conspires in inventing the news.
</P>
<P>
   Competition's devastating effect on careful journalism is
brutally and embarrassingly illustrated by Steven Brill's article,
``Pressgate,'' in the first issue of his new magazine, Content.
Brill's study describes something like a media panic that occurred
with the Monica Lewinsky story.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure not to be scooped, news people published whatever
was ``out there,'' without pausing to confirm it by the usual
methods or, sometimes, even to discuss whether it was worth
throwing at the public.
</P>
<P>
   Now that television never sleeps, it needs round-the-clock news,
and on an intensely competitive story he who stops long enough to
check must lose the race. This, at any rate, is what apologists for
the TV networks told Brill.
</P>
<P>
   All this brings back memories of working in Fleet Street, London
headquarters of the British press, 40 years ago. Waugh's ``Scoop''
was based on Fleet Street's popular journalism, and his point was
that it was ridiculously fraudulent. It was indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Anything went. There the farce was often richer than Waugh's.
For example:
</P>
<P>
   During the early 1950s the Iranian government was in the hands
of one Mohammad Mossadegh, who had infuriated the big powers by
threatening to take charge of his nation's oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   To stop this nonsense, the CIA was engineering his ruin and
working to put the Shah in power. Reporters fell upon Tehran like
locusts.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Express scooped the world one morning in 1953 with a
bylined story from its ace foreign correspondent. ``I saw Mossadegh
hanged today,'' was the opening sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Mossadegh died 13 years later. That was Fleet Street. Now the
Brits are everywhere in American journalism, Lord save us.

   XIAN, China _ With the pageantry of thundering drums and
clanging gongs, President Clinton was welcomed to China on Thursday
night, the first American president to visit this country in nearly
a decade, and he mildly rebuked critics in Washington who have
attacked his policy of engagement with the Beijing government.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be those here and back in America who wonder whether
closer ties and deeper friendship between America and China are
good,'' the president said, speaking as much to his audience at
home as to the throngs of Chinese who poured into the streets of
Xian on Thursday to give Clinton a tumultuous welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the answer is yes,'' the president said. ``We can
learn much from each other. And as two great nations, we have a
special responsibility to the future of the world. The steps we
take over the next week can lead to far greater strides for our
people in the years ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   The 30-minute ceremony was a made-for-TV spectacle, replete with
warriors in Tang dynasty costumes, a score of maidens in flowing
white gowns bearing baskets of flowers and yellow-robed riders
astride strutting horses. Red paper lanterns hung from the
lampposts, and bright silk banners bearing images of mythical birds
of good fortune flapped in the breeze on a mild smoggy night.
</P>
<P>
   The crowds of factory workers, students, bankers and public
officials began vying for position at 9 a.m. on the sidewalks
around the square before the old city's South Gate, where the
president gave a short speech nearly 12 hours later. By evening,
the crowd extended for two miles down South Avenue out of the
square.
</P>
<P>
   Still two days away from the formal part of his trip, a one-day
summit conference with President Jiang Zemin in Beijing, Clinton
did not dwell here on any of the major, substantive differences
between China and the United States. Instead, he offered brief,
general remarks that stressed the positive aspects of the way the
Chinese-American relationship has developed since 1989, the year in
which President George Bush visited China and the Chinese
government used military force to crush pro-democracy protests in
Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his diplomatically indirect reference to the
political climate in the United States about China, recently
inflamed on Capitol Hill over questions about illegal campaign
contributions and the spread of nuclear weapons, Clinton offered a
gentle reminder of the gulf between the two countries on matters of
human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Respect for the worth, the dignity, the potential and the
freedom of every citizen is a vital source of America's strength
and success,'' the president said as People's Liberation Army
searchlights played in the sky above him. ``In this global
information age, where both economic growth and individual
opportunity are based on ideas, a commitment to providing all human
beings the opportunity to develop their full potential is vital to
the strength and success of the new China, as well.''
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing, U.S. officials complained to the Chinese government
on Thursday over reports that several dissidents had been detained
and others harassed in connection with President Clinton's state
visit.
</P>
<P>
   But in Xian, which the White House chose for the first stop
specifically because it is a city without strong political
symbolism in modern times, the focus was on ceremony and on the
city's undeniably enthusiastic welcome for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The president and Hillary Rodham Clinton, showing the effects of
their 18-hour, 10,000-mile journey from Washington, made their way
down 150 yards of red carpet to the base of Xian's floodlit South
Gate, part of the fortifications that once guarded the city,
China's imperial capital for more than 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   Xian's mayor, Fang Xichu, officially welcomed ``your excellency
Mr. President and Mrs. President,'' and presented Clinton with a
key to the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it a delight when friends visit from afar?'' Fang said,
quoting Confucius.
</P>
<P>
   The South Gate, also known as the Gate of Eternal Tranquillity,
was built in 1317, 400 years after the end of the Tang dynasty, a
period many Chinese regard as a high point in their civilization.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd in the large square facing the gate numbered only a
few hundred, limited by security concerns. But thick throngs lined
the route of Clinton's 50-car motorcade into the city from the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was a moment to be savored for many in the crowd, a
break from the routine and a sign of China's growing acceptance as
a weighty world player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lived here more than 20 years and I've never seen as many
people gathered for anything before,'' said Chang Yingxiao, a
division chief in the Xian health bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Chen Tong, a 13-year-old boy came to the parade route to see
Clinton's car, and, perhaps, catch a glimpse of the president
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I very much like President Clinton, I even worship him,'' he
said. Asked if he held any other Americans in such reverence, the
boy answered, ``George Washington and Michael Jordan.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Controversy has raged in the United States over Clinton's
nine-day, five-city trip to China. Nearly a third of the members of
Congress had urged Clinton to delay the trip until charges of
illegal Chinese contributions to the 1996 Democratic campaign and
the transfer of missile technology to China had been resolved. Many
human rights advocates object to his rewarding the Chinese
government with a state visit while thousands of political
dissidents remain jailed.
</P>
<P>
   But The president's aides aides have hoped to use the trip to
project an image back to the United States of a prospering,
striving China that poses new challenges for economic competition,
not nuclear or ideological confrontation, and Clinton struck that
tone from the first moments of his visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, in this city famous for calligraphy, a new chapter in
China's story is being written,'' he said. ``We Americans admire
your accomplishments, your economy, your hard work, creativity and
vision, your efforts against hunger and poverty, your work with us
on peace and stability in Korea and South Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I believe both Chinese and Americans aspire to many
of the same things: to provide for our families, to teach our
children, to build our communities, to protect our Earth, to shape
our own futures and pass brighter possibilities on to our
children.''

ELITE MILITARY BAND TO PLAY FOR THE CLINTONS

<P>
   BEIJING _ Foreign presidents may come and go, Communist Party
leaders may rise and fall, but one thing has remained the same
throughout decades of state visits to Beijing: the People's
Liberation Army Military Band.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday afternoon, on the plaza of a Defense Ministry compound
in west Beijing, the elite, 60-member brass band rehearsed snappy
renditions of ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' and the Chinese national
anthem, ``March of the Volunteers,'' which it will play on Saturday
at the official greeting for President Clinton in front of the
Great Hall of the People on Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   The band greets every visiting head of state, and also performs
at every state dinner as well as at various public affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was founded at the instruction of Mao Tse-tung in 1952,
the band has performed 48,000 times at important national and
international events, said Col. Fan Siting, who will conduct the
band for the Clinton festivities.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday, Cheng Yiming, Fan's predecessor,
reminisced about the first state visit by an American president,
that of Richard Nixon in 1972, which Cheng remembers with great
pride and clarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We chose the songs very carefully,'' said Cheng, now retired.
</P>
<P>
   For the welcoming dinner, the band made sure to play ``Home on
the Range,'' he said. ``This was recommended by the Foreign
Ministry, which told us this was a popular song in Nixon's hometown
and had been performed at his inauguration.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other American songs, in between Chinese favorites, was
``America the Beautiful,'' Cheng said. Later, after dinner and
toasts, Prime Minister Chou En-lai asked the band to play ``Home on
the Range'' again.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon thanked the band and said it was the best performance he
had ever heard, Cheng recalled. Nixon handed out a glass-encased
name card to everyone as a gift, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the most recent visit by an American president, that of
George Bush in early 1989, the band added ``Yellow Rose of Texas''
and ``Shenandoah'' to the evening repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what songs the band might play for Clinton and his wife,
Hillary Rodham Clinton, at dinner in the Great Hall of the People
on Saturday, the 12 officers assembled for the interview fidgeted,
as if worried about revealing secret information.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, one said: ``We don't know yet. The songs are chosen by
the protocol department of the Foreign Ministry, and they haven't
decided yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The band is ready to play many different American songs, the
officers said, but most are old standbys. ``There are not enough
cultural exchanges, and we expect the Americans to teach us some of
the newer popular songs,'' one said.
</P>
<P>
   Though it is much less true today, a couple of decades ago the
People's Liberation Army band was one of the few paths available to
young aspiring musicians, providing quite a respectable career. To
join, those who pass a qualifying test must first spend three years
training in an army arts institute. Once in the band, musicians
usually spend their entire careers there.
</P>
<P>
   Now even this stodgy institution in the most stodgy of
ministries is trying to branch out. Several players formed a jazz
band, which played at a jazz festival here earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   A leading saxophonist from the band, who wants to become better
known and perhaps land side jobs playing at private parties,
recently rented out the Beijing Music Hall, the local equivalent of
Carnegie Hall, to put on a concert. He generated advance notices in
the press and, with the help of no little free ticket distribution,
played to a full house.

COURT RULING BOLSTERS RIGHTS OF AIDS-INFECTED PEOPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS BLACK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In its first AIDS-related ruling, the Supreme Court
Thursday found that a Maine woman infected with the virus that
causes AIDS is protected from discrimination under the Americans
with Disability Act.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-4 ruling sends the case back to a lower court to
reconsider whether a Bangor dentist, Randon Bragdon, violated the
anti-discrimination law by refusing to fill a cavity in Sidney
Abbott's tooth in his office because she was HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``HIV infection, even in the so-called asymptomatic phase, is an
impairment which substantially limits the major life activity of
reproduction'' and therefore qualifies for coverage under the
disability law, wrote Justice Anthony M. Kennedy for the majority.
He said a health-care professional could not assess the risk of
infection unless it was based on objective and scientific
information.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott, now 37, who works with developmentally disabled adults
in Bangor, said at a Boston news conference that she was
``gratified'' by the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to take legal action against Dr. Bragdon because
what he did was wrong,'' she said. ``And if Dr. Bragdon refused to
treat me just because I am HIV positive, I knew he would do it to
others.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a truly historic day for public health,'' said Dr.
Howard Koh, a member of the Massachusetts Commission Against
Discrimination. ``This decision upholds a cornerstone of public
health, that everyone has a right to basic health care without
being discriminated against.''
</P>
<P>
   Bragdon, a Tufts-educated dentist and lifelong Bangor resident,
said he had a ``mixed'' reaction. He and his lawyer, John McCarthy
of Bangor, said they were pleased Bragdon would have a chance to
argue that he should be allowed to rely upon his professional
judgment in deciding how to treat his patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about not treating,'' Bragdon said in a phone
interview. ``It's about being able to treat prudently. ...If we
really get to court and have a real trial, the science is on our
side.''
</P>
<P>
   Because AIDS is a fatal illness, Bragdon said health care
professionals should take special precautions in treating patients
who carry the virus. The ``universal precautions'' recommended to
dentists _ wearing a mask, gloves and protective glasses _ were not
foolproof, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Bragdon had offered to work on Abbott's tooth in
a hospital instead of his dental office and said she would have to
pay the additional cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an affirmation of Congress' intent to make sure that
people with all kinds of serious illness need protection from
discrimination regardless of how far the disease has progressed or
how they appear to people,'' said Bennett H. Klein, a co-counsel
for Abbott and a lawyer with the Gay and Lesbian Advocates and
Defenders, based in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Nan Feyler, an expert on AIDS and law at the University of
Pennsylvania Law School, said the decision set a new standard for
people with HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole purpose of discrimination law is not to allow fear
to dictate,'' she said. ``Otherwise, people don't want to sit next
to blacks, don't want to eat food served by Hispanics, and don't
want medical exams done by women. No matter how sincere, fear
cannot be allowed to deny a service.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in a statement released by the White House,
said, ``This decision reinforces the protections offered by the
landmark Americans with Disabilities Act for Americans living with
HIV and AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   Public health officials estimate that more than 1 million
Americans are infected with the virus. Many now live for years
without symptoms and avoid development of AIDS because of advances
in medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The court found that Abbott, who has been HIV positive since
1986, qualified as disabled because the virus prevents her from
having children, because the likelihood of passing the virus to the
fetus and a sexual partner was so high that it effectively kept her
from reproducing or engaging in sexual intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, in his decision, said the dentist ``failed to present
any objective, medical evidence showing that treating respondent in
a hospital would be safer or more efficient in preventing HIV
transmission than treatment in a well-equipped dental office.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Kennedy in the majority opinion were Justices John Paul
Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen G.
Breyer. Dissenting were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and, in part, Sandra Day
O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist, writing for the minority, questioned whether
reproduction was a ``major life activity.'' The federal disability
law defines disability as an impairment that limits a major life
activity. ``There is absolutely no evidence that absent the HIV,
respondent would have had or was even considering having
children,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Bragdon vs. Abbott, 97-156.

RULING EXPECTED TO HAVE CHILLING EFFECT ON ARTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By an 8 to 1 vote, the Supreme Court Thursday upheld a 1990 law
that requires the National Endowment for the Arts to consider
``general standards of decency'' in its grant-making process. The
Court reversed a 1996 Federal appeals court decision that declared
the law unconstitutional because it violates the right to free
speech and due process.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's decision sent shock waves through the artistic
community, with artists and administrators predicting a chilling
effect on cultural expression. But the decision was greeted with a
round of applause from groups that have opposed the NEA and a
handful of its controverial grants, most notably those that went to
exhibitions that displayed the photography of Andres Serrano and
the late Robert Mapplethorpe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are living in an ice age, and this decision will prove to
be a cold, snowy white monument,'' said Holly Hughes, one of four
performance artists who sued the government in 1990 after they were
denied Federal funding.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, Karen Finley, Tim Miller, and John Fleck, who have
become known as ``the NEA four,'' settled their original claims
against the government in 1993 for damages totaling $252,000, but
they continued their legal challenge against the so-called
``decency clause.'' ``I have seen what the threat of the `decency'
language has done to the world I work in,'' Hughes said. ``It has
destroyed the alternative arts scene in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   But William Donohue, president of the Catholic League for
Religious and Civil Rights, Thursday declared the decision ``a
victory for common sense, as well as decency.'' The
Washington-based Family Research Council also lauded the decision,
as did House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today the Supreme Court validated the right of the American
people to not pay for art that offends their sensibilities,''
Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the majority, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor concluded
that the law is ``valid, as it neither inherently interferes with
First Amendment rights nor violates constitutional vagueness
principles.'' The court qualified its decision by writing, ``Even
in the provision of subsidies, the Government may not `aim at the
suppression of dangerous ideas,' and if a subsidy were
`manipulated' to have a `coercive effect,' then relief could be
appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The law was enacted in 1990 at the height of a controversy in
Congress over NEA grants that indirectly funded art by
Mapplethorpe, whose work includes graphic homoerotic images, and by
Serrano, particularly for his infamous photograph of a Crucifix
immersed in urine, titled ``Piss Christ.'' The law required the NEA
to consider, in making grant awards, ``general standards of decency
and respect for the diverse beliefs and values of the American
public.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The court reaffirms the principle that the government cannot
discriminate against unpopular political ideas,'' said Marjorie
Heins, outgoing director of the Arts Censorship Project at the
American Civil Liberties Union and one of the attorneys for the
plaintiffs. ``But at the same time, it is an unrealistic way of
viewing the message this law sends to the NEA and to artists to be
careful and conscious and to censor themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In their original suit, the four performance artists charged
that they were ``blacklisted'' by the NEA for their political
views; Hughes, Miller and Fleck are gay and address their sexuality
in solo performances, and Finley is known for her stridently
feminist material.
</P>
<P>
   Since the suit was filed, the NEA has restructured its
grant-making system, cutting out all grants to individual artists,
channeling most of its funds to state arts councils and limiting
arts institutions to one grant application per year. Congress has
dramatically cut the budget over the years to current allotment of
$98 million.
</P>
<P>
   NEA chairman William J. Ivey, who was on Capitol Hill Thursday
seeking Congressional support for the agency, said in a statement
that he was pleased with the Supreme Court decision. ``The
Endowment's citizen review panels represent the broad diversity of
the American people,'' he said, adding that the agency ``remains
committed to full First Amendment protection.''
</P>
<P>
   The First Amendment was at the heart of Justice David Souter's
lone dissent. He argued that the law should be struck down because
it carries ``a significant power to chill artistic production and
display.''
</P>
<P>
   Arts administrators echoed that sentiment Thursday. ``It is a
dark day,'' said David Ross, executive director of San Francisco's
Museum of Modern Art and former director of the Institute of
Contemporary Art in Boston. ``It is a complete refutation of the
founding principles of the NEA which were to support excellence and
to insulate the process from the winds of politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross and others, however, said that the NEA is becoming
increasingly irrelevant to the nation's nonprofit arts
organizations; it has limited its grant applications to four broad
categories, and it no longer provides general operating support,
which is the hardest money for nonprofits to raise from corporate
and private sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue about government funding is practically moot because
it doesn't exist anymore,'' said Robert Brustein, artistic director
of the American Repertory Theatre in Cambridge, Mass. ART, he said,
received about $800,000 a year from the NEA before the controversy
began; it received $62,500 this year. But he added, ``It's going to
send a chill through the artistic community, and you can already
see it in the conservative and safe choices most theaters are
making.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley, who became widely known as ``the chocolate woman'' for a
performance in which she smeared chocolate and alfalfa sprouts on
her body as a symbol, she said, of oppression against women, was
not available for comment Thursday. Her publicist, however, said
she was going to address the decision in her performance last night
at an alternative theater in the Tri-Beca district of Manhattan.
Her show, ``The Return of the Chocolate Smeared Woman,'' opened
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ACLU attorney Heins said that the court decision left open the
possibility that artists could challenge the law again if they
proved that the law discriminated against their First Amendment
rights. ``It could be revived if such an instance came up, but this
case essentially is over.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is National Endowment for the Arts vs. Finley, 97-371.

&HT;     GLENN SWEATS IT OUT AS ASTRONAUTS GO THROUGH FLIGHT SIMULATION
</HEADLINE>
     &HT;     By SCOTT MONTGOMERY 
 &HT;     c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ In the cramped metal compartments of the space shuttle
trainer, Ohio Sen. John Glenn and crew broke a heavy sweat Thursday
while they hurried through a simulation of the first hectic moments
in orbit.
</P>
<P>
   During the nearly four-hour training session, the seven-member
crew was clocked going through the laborious process of converting
the shuttle's two flight decks into laboratories by removing the
folding seats and storing their bulky pressurized launch suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was work. I was sweating,'' Glenn said afterward. ``My
underwear was soaked.''
</P>
<P>
   The crew wears blue thermal underwear beneath the orange launch
suits, and as part of the drill each member had to extricate
himself from the outer shell, emerging through a thick zipper along
the spine like larvae, before stowing the 100 pounds of gear. The
heavy suits only are used during launch and re-entry.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning less than 10 minutes after launch, the three crew
members on the mid-deck _ including Glenn _ will begin the
conversion process that must be completed within two and a half
hours so orbit experiments can be started on time.
</P>
<P>
   Computers must be set up, hatches must be opened, and launch
equipment must be stored so it can be retrieved easily for the trip
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big task for the first day,'' Flight Commander Curt
Brown said, ``and you don't want to get behind.''
</P>
<P>
   With the late October launch just four months away, the shuttle
Discovery's crew has moved into the meat of its crew coordination
training. Since the crew was named in February, most of the
training up to now has been individual work that involved either
learning shuttle equipment or learning about the experiments to be
conducted.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said the flight has more than 80 experiments scheduled. So
many, in fact, they're considering whether to they can keep them
all. ``We may have a little more than we can do in a nine-day
mission, realistically. So we may have to cut that down a little
bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Two studies that won't be touched are those central to Glenn's
involvement in the space flight. At 77, Glenn will be the oldest
person ever in space and will be a prime subject of scientific
experiments on the erosion of muscle strength and the loss of sleep
associated with extended weightlessness.
</P>
<P>
   Both problems also plague elderly people on earth, and NASA
researchers hope that by sending a man of Glenn's age they will get
some hints about what triggers these physical changes. Several
other changes, including weakening of immune systems, also run
parallel between astronauts and the aged and could be subjects of
future study.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn was buoyant and smiling as the training wrapped up, even
as he and the crew, with the thin blue underwear pasted to their
bodies with sweat, ducked past a row of cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a good drill up there,'' Glenn said. ``Physically? I
feel great. Had a good sweat, I got a good workout.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's wife Annie also attended the session, as she has through
much of the training. After enduring the pioneering uncertainty of
Glenn's first space flight in 1962 she said her husband's role in
today's space program is easier to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   Except, of course, that he'll be 77 on launch day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He keeps me going,'' she laughed. ``He keeps me alert.''

UNION GROUP BACKS HARSHBARGER FOR BAY STATE GOVERNOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS AND JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Setting aside their reservations over his labor
credentials, the state's largest union organization Thursday gave
Attorney General Scott Harshbarger a major victory in his bid for
the Democratic gubernatorial nomination when they voted to endorse
him over his two opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger, who needed a two-thirds majority of the AFL-CIO
excutive council, won the union backing when 40 of the 56 union
leaders from around Massachusetts gathered behind closed doors to
consider which state-wide candidates to back.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger's victory came after strong lobbying from the
AFL-CIO's top officers, who are convinced he is the only Democratic
candidate who has the resources and organization to unseat Acting
Governor Paul Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tremendous boost to my campaign,'' Harshbarger said
after the union vote that further consolidates his position as the
Democrat's leading contender in the Sept. 15 primary. ``This is
part of the slow and steady road to getting there.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, state labor leaders have been cool to
Harshbarger, particlarly since he beat one of their strongest
allies, former Attorney General James Shannon in 1990. The union
officials feel Harshbarger only recently reached out to them as he
runs for governor. They also are angry over what they feel is his
office's failure to enforce wage laws.
</P>
<P>
   But labor sources said the AFL-CIO leaders' strong argument to
some reluctant council members was that Harshbarger is a far
stronger candidate than his two rivals, former state Senator
Patricia McGovern and former US Representative Brian Donnelly, both
of whom trail far behind Harshbarger in the polls and in
fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Haynes, the AFL-CIO's secretary/treasurer, who lobbied
heavily for the 400,000 member labor group to back Harshbarger,
praised him as a ``strong and solid voice for working people with
the strength and conviction to beat the Republican Party in
November.''
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger's victory Thursday is a blow to his two rivals'
efforts to derail his increasingly strong, front-running status.
McGovern, the former Senate Ways and Means chairperson who angered
unions with her budget cuts during the state fiscal crises in the
late 1980's, had little support at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Donnelly, who had a strong labor record in Congress, had worked
with his supporters on the council to keep Harshbarger from getting
the necessary two thirds to win the endorsement, but failed in the
face of the union leadership's lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   ``This breaks the backbone of his opponents and eliminates the
rational of his opponents,'' said Lou DiNatale, a Democratic
political analyst. ``The political community has consistently
underestimated Harshbarger's ability to put together all the key
elements in a Democratic primary.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, both Donnelly and McGovern swore Thursday to continue to
seek the support of union members and locals, despite the vote for
Harshbarger.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won the first battle of the union leaders and we intend to
win the next of the union members,'' Donnelly said, touting his
20-year record of support for workers. ``This is far, far, far from
over.''
</P>
<P>
   McGovern also said she would take her case to the rank-and-file
union members around the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working men and women of Massachusetts deserve more than
slogans, they need a governor who can bring people together and
solve some of their problems,'' McGovern said. ``I'm confident that
a number of individual unions will be supportive and endorse me.''
</P>
<P>
   Haynes said he respected both Donnelly and McGovern, but said
Harshbager has embraced a strong union position and has
demonstrated this year and in past campaigns that he is a
formidable candidate.
</P>
<P>
   `Harshbarger's probably the most powerful campaigner in the
state,'' Haynes said. ``This guy is running an old-time grass roots
campaign and it is pretty impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO endorsement is the second major victory for
Harshbarger this month. On June 6 at the state Democratic Party
convention, he won a first ballot victory over McGovern and
Donnelly for the party's official endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO endorsement is also important because it provides
Harshbarger with the organization and campaign workers that played
key roles in recent Democratic victories. Haynes said the union
wanted to get behind a candidate now and not wait until after the
election in order to have enough time to pull together an effective
union campaign for the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Labor's energized efforts to bolster US Senator Edward Kennedy,
who was facing a serious Republican challenger in 1994, and its
strong backing of US Senator John Kerry in 1996 in his tough battle
with William F. Weld were seen as key elements in their victories.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger said the union backing will be key to any success in
the general election. He said he expected that the AFL-CIO's
endorsement was causing concern for Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul Cellucci would have been the happiest man sitting there
today if the AFL-CIO hadn't made an endorsement,'' he said. ``He's
got to be very seriously worried that the AFL-CIO has endorsed a
person who can unseat him.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the
Constitution prohibited the president from rewriting legislation by
vetoing single items of spending or tax breaks approved by
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In a 6-3 decision, the court rejected a decades-old attempt
mostly by Congressional Republican leaders to strengthen the hand
of the president in struggles with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The court quoted George Washington, who presided over the
Constitutional Convention and later wrote that a president must
``approve all the parts of a bill, or reject it in toto,'' but
cannot modify the text of legislation presented to him by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's reasoning Thursday was exceptionally simple.
``The president has amended two acts of Congress by repealing a
portion of each,'' said the majority opinion by Justice John Paul
Stevens. ``Repeal of statutes, no less than enactment, must conform
with Article I'' of the Constitution, which established ``a single
finely wrought and exhaustively considered procedure'' for enacting
laws.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Congress tried to improve on that procedure by allowing
the president to cancel individual items of federal spending and
tax breaks, arguing that such power, held by governors in many
states, would help eliminate the budget deficit. But the court said
Thursday that such ``line-item vetoes'' were unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Line-Item Veto Act authorizes the president himself to
effect the repeal of laws, for his own policy reasons, without
observing the procedures set out in Article I,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, traveling in China, said he was ``deeply
disappointed'' with the ruling. ``The decision is a defeat for all
Americans,'' he said. ``It deprives the president of a valuable
tool for eliminating waste in the federal budget and for enlivening
the public debate over how to make the best use of public funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has used the line-item veto to rewrite 11 laws,
eliminating 82 items, including money that would have gone to New
York City hospitals and a tax break for Idaho potato growers.
Challenges to those vetoes led to Thursday's decision.
</P>
<P>
   In a concurring opinion, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy chided
Congress for surrendering power to the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Failure of political will does not justify unconstitutional
remedies,'' he declared. ``Abdication of responsibility is not part
of the constitutional design.''
</P>
<P>
   The Line-Item Veto Act was passed as part of the Republicans'
Contract With America. Sixty-nine senators and more than 290 House
members voted for it.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said that the device ``compromises the political liberty
of our citizens'' by concentrating power in the hands of the
president. ``Liberty is always at stake when one or more of the
branches seek to transgress the separation of powers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Antonin Scalia, Stephen Breyer and Sandra Day O'Connor
dissented, saying they would have upheld the line-item veto. Scalia
said ``there is not a dime's worth of difference'' between allowing
the president to cancel a particular project, through the line-item
veto, and allowing him to spend money on a particular item at his
discretion.
</P>
<P>
   Two champions of the line-item veto, Sens. John McCain of
Arizona and Daniel Coats of Indiana, both Republicans, said they
would keep fighting for it. They have proposed an alternative,
under which each item in an omnibus appropriations bill would be
submitted to the president as a separate piece of legislation for
him to sign or veto. Under this arrangement, the president would
receive thousands of bills each year.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said the Line-Item Veto Act ``gives the president the
unilateral power to change the text of duly enacted statutes.''
</P>
<P>
   In exercising the power, President Clinton has infuriated
members of Congress, including many who supported the device in
principle. Conservative Republicans joined Democrats in complaining
that Clinton had killed worthy projects in their home states. In
February, Congress overturned the vetoes of 38 military
construction projects worth $287 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., the foremost opponent of the
line-item veto, was ecstatic after the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great day for the United States of America, a great
day for the Constitution of the United States,'' Byrd said. ``Today
we feel that the liberties of the American people have been
assured. God save this honorable Court!''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, who has served in the Senate for nearly 40 years,
expressed dismay at Breyer's opinion. Advocating a pragmatic view
of the Constitution, Breyer said the line-item veto was an
acceptable ``experiment'' that did not ``threaten the liberties of
individual citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd said this was ``a remarkable position to take.'' He quoted
Sir William Blackstone, the 18th-century English jurist, who wrote:
``In all tyrannical governments, the supreme magistracy, or the
right of both making and enforcing the laws, is vested in one and
the same man, or one and the same body of men. And wherever these
two powers are united together, there can be no public liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd led six members of Congress in challenging the
constitutionality of the line-item veto last year, before Clinton
had used the device. In June 1997, the Supreme Court ruled that
there was no genuine ``case or controversy'' because the lawmakers
had not suffered any ``personal, concrete injury.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, by contrast, the court said that the New York
hospitals and the Idaho potato growers had suffered an ``actual
injury.'' Justice Stevens said that the line-item veto, by creating
a potential liability of at least $2.6 billion for New York, could
harm the city's financial strength and borrowing power.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices Kennedy, David
Souter, Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined the majority
opinion by Justice Stevens in the case, Clinton vs. City of New
York, No. 97-1374.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As a result of the ruling, New York can keep all the federal
money it received for the care of poor people under Medicaid, and
Idaho potato growers can keep the tax break they received from
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   People affected by other line-item vetoes, including banks and
insurance companies and military contractors, will also benefit,
even though they did not challenge President Clinton's actions in
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody who was a victim should be standing in line at the
Treasury or some other agency to get their money or to file for a
tax refund if they've already paid taxes,'' said Alan Morrison, a
lawyer who filed a friend-of-the-court brief for three House
Democrats opposed to the line item veto.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said the court was expressing ``no opinion about the
wisdom'' of the line item veto procedure. But, he said, if Congress
wants to establish such a procedure, it must amend the
Constitution.

HOUSE PANEL URGES FINANCIAL RESCUE PLAN FOR SPACE STATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Concerned that Russia's worsening economy has
jeopardized that nation's key role in the U.S.-led international
space station, NASA's House oversight committee has asked the
Clinton administration to forge a financial rescue strategy within
30 days.
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan request was included in a strongly worded letter
to President Clinton, signed by House Science Committee Chairman
James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., and Rep. George Brown of California,
the panel's ranking Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The International Space Station program is in trouble,'' they
warned. ``We face a situation in which there can be little
confidence that the Russian government will make adequate funding
available to meet its commitments ...''
</P>
<P>
   The committee's request followed a hearing on the station where
NASA administrator Dan Goldin acknowledged a mounting cost problem,
but said he was not prepared to propose a solution with a price tag
until the year 2000 federal budget is presented to Congress next
February.
</P>
<P>
   A recent agency-sought reappraisal, though, estimates U.S. costs
have escalated from $17.3 billion to nearly $25 billion since 1993,
the year Russia joined the project.
</P>
<P>
   Though invited, neither White House science policy nor budget
office representatives appeared before the committee. The White
House would not comment on the letter Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   However, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
remained steadfast in its plans to begin the orbital assembly of
the new station with the Nov. 20 launching of the first
U.S.-financed, Russian-built component from Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we are comfortable we can still go ahead with the
assembly,'' said Gretchen McClain, NASA's Washington-based
technical director for the program.
</P>
<P>
   The first of 33 U.S. shuttle assembly missions is tentatively
scheduled for a Dec. 3 liftoff. All told, about 90 launches will be
required to assemble and sustain the growing complex over at least
the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, representatives from the United States,
Russia, Europe, Japan and Canada approved the third delay in the
start of assembly plans. It accommodated the latest in a series of
financially driven postponements in the construction of the
station's Russian service module, the first habitable component,
now scheduled for a late April liftoff.
</P>
<P>
   Space agency officials said Thursday that Russia's financial
difficulties now appear to pose the greatest threat to the
production of Progress and Soyuz capsules for the launch of fuel
and human crews to the station. Earlier U.S. concerns over Russian
finances were focused on the service module, which is nearly
assembled.
</P>
<P>
   Regular Progress fuel missions will be required after the
service module arrives in orbit to keep the massive station
circling at safe altitudes.
</P>
<P>
   The latest concerns over Russia's role arose in the spring when
new economic turmoil surfaced. Already in arrears to its station
program, the difficulties forced the Russian government to cut its
space budget.
</P>
<P>
   Its pledge of $340 million to the Russian Space Agency for
station work, much of it to come from unconventional financing
schemes, was cut to the U.S. equivalent of $160 million.
</P>
<P>
   The lesser amount was calculated to assure the launching of the
first component in November and the service module next year as
well as the earliest parts that will be necessary to make the
Progress capsules.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardware they have in place we think, right now, can get
us through 1999,'' McClain said.

COURT REJECTS STARR EFFORT TO OBTAIN FOSTER-RELATED NOTES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Supreme Court Thursday rebuffed Independent Counsel Kenneth
W. Starr's effort to obtain notes taken by a lawyer for a
now-deceased White House aide, ruling that conversations between
attorneys and their clients should be protected beyond the grave.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-3 decision, which was watched closely by the Clinton
administration and the legal community, overturned an appeals court
decision that sided with Starr. The high court said Starr's
argument was not persuasive enough to justify narrowing the
nation's oldest legal privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Starr wanted the court to force James Hamilton, the attorney for
Deputy White House Counsel Vincent W. Foster, to turn over three
pages of notes he took in 1993, nine days before Foster committed
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the majority in the first federal test of posthumous
attorney-client privilege, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said,
``It has been generally, if not universally, accepted for well over
a century, that the attorney-client privilege survives the death of
the client in a case such as this.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton hailed the ruling as as ``victory for the legal
profession. This case in importance transcended the facts of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr, in a written statement, said, ``Although we are
disappointed in the outcome of the Supreme Court's decision, we
understand and respect the care and expedition with which the Court
resolved the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr added, ``The issue has obviously proved to be of
considerable difficulty, as the divided opinions of the Supreme
Court and the Court of Appeals reveal. In all events, we continue
to pursue our investigations as thoroughly and expeditiously as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials are trying to sort out the ruling's
implications on Starr's effort to require Clinton confidant Bruce
Lindsey to testify about his conversations with the president in
the early days of the Monica Lewinsky investigation. The White
House has argued attorney-client privilege in that case, which is
currently moving through the appeals courts.
</P>
<P>
   One administration official called Thursday's ruling a
``setback'' for Starr. A White House official traveling with
President Clinton in China called it ``an important validation of
the vital issue of attorney-client privilege.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr was seeking Hamilton's notes to help determine whether
Clinton aides commited perjury, obstructed justice or committed
other crimes in connection with Hillary Rodham Clinton's role in
the 1993 dismissal of employees from the White House travel office.
</P>
<P>
   She has said she had no role in the firings, but a draft memo by
a former White House aide given to Whitewater investigators in 1996
portrays her as being behind the dismissals. The memo also says
that Foster spoke to Hillary Clinton about the travel office issue.
</P>
<P>
   Starr subpoeaned Hamilton in December 1995 for the handwritten
notes he took during a two-hour meeting with Foster on July 11,
1993. Foster had come to him for legal represenation over the
dismissals in the travel office. Nine days later, Foster was found
dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in a park in suburban
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton resisted the subpoena, and the appeals court later
ruled that the attorney-client privilege of confidentiality should
be waived when the information is important to a criminal case.
</P>
<P>
   But the Supreme Court said there was no case law holding that
the privilege applies differently in criminal and civil cases, and
that a client may not know when disclosing information to an
attorney whether it will later be relevant to a civil or criminal
matter.
</P>
<P>
   The case grabbed the attention of the legal community, with the
American Bar Association, National Association of Criminal Defense
Lawyers, American Corporate Counsel Association and National
Hospice Organization, all arguing that the legal privilege should
extend after a client's death. Ending that long-established rule
would be chilling to a lawyer's relationship with a client.
</P>
<P>
   While Rehnquist said Starr's arguments against the posthumous
privilege were not ``frivolous,'' he said Starr simply had not
satisified his burden of showing that ``reason and experience''
require the rule to be broken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing that communications will remain confidential even
after death serves a weighty interest in encouraging a client to
communicate fully and frankly with counsel; posthumous disclosure
of such communications may be as feared as disclosure during the
client's lifetime,'' the court said.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, Anthony M.
Kennedy, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G.
Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Those dissenting were Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin
Scalia and Clarence Thomas. In the dissent, O'Connor wrote: ``In my
view, a criminal defendant's right to exculpatory evidence or a
compelling law enforcement need for information may, where the
testimony is not avaialble from other sources, overrride a client's
posthumous interest in confidentiality.''
</P>
<P>
   John Q. Barrett, a criminal law professor at St. John's
University School of Law and former associate counsel to the
Iran-Contra special prosecutor, Lawrence E. Walsh, said if the
ruling had gone the other way, the case would have minimal impact,
despite rhetoric about the horrors that would result from narrowing
attorney-client privilege. ``There just aren't many prosecutors who
happen to need something that happens to be in the hands of a
lawyer whose client has died,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the decision will likely end efforts to seek
long-sealed papers in the 106-year-old case of Lizzie Borden, who
was prosecuted but acquitted of the hatchet murders of her parents.
The notes of Borden's defense lawyer, George Robinson, are locked
in the offices of the Springfield, Mass., law firm he founded.

RULING EXPECTED TO HAVE CHILLING EFFECT ON ARTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By an 8 to 1 vote, the Supreme Court Thursday upheld a 1990 law
that requires the National Endowment for the Arts to consider
``general standards of decency'' in its grant-making process. The
Court reversed a 1996 Federal appeals court decision that declared
the law unconstitutional because it violates the right to free
speech and due process.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's decision sent shock waves through the artistic
community, with artists and administrators predicting a chilling
effect on cultural expression. But the decision was greeted with a
round of applause from groups that have opposed the NEA and a
handful of its controverial grants, most notably those that went to
exhibitions that displayed the photography of Andres Serrano and
the late Robert Mapplethorpe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are living in an ice age, and this decision will prove to
be a cold, snowy white monument,'' said Holly Hughes, one of four
performance artists who sued the government in 1990 after they were
denied Federal funding.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, Karen Finley, Tim Miller, and John Fleck, who have
become known as ``the NEA four,'' settled their original claims
against the government in 1993 for damages totaling $252,000, but
they continued their legal challenge against the so-called
``decency clause.'' ``I have seen what the threat of the `decency'
language has done to the world I work in,'' Hughes said. ``It has
destroyed the alternative arts scene in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   But William Donohue, president of the Catholic League for
Religious and Civil Rights, Thursday declared the decision ``a
victory for common sense, as well as decency.'' The
Washington-based Family Research Council also lauded the decision,
as did House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today the Supreme Court validated the right of the American
people to not pay for art that offends their sensibilities,''
Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the majority, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor concluded
that the law is ``valid, as it neither inherently interferes with
First Amendment rights nor violates constitutional vagueness
principles.'' The court qualified its decision by writing, ``Even
in the provision of subsidies, the Government may not `aim at the
suppression of dangerous ideas,' and if a subsidy were
`manipulated' to have a `coercive effect,' then relief could be
appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The law was enacted in 1990 at the height of a controversy in
Congress over NEA grants that indirectly funded art by
Mapplethorpe, whose work includes graphic homoerotic images, and by
Serrano, particularly for his infamous photograph of a Crucifix
immersed in urine, titled ``Piss Christ.'' The law required the NEA
to consider, in making grant awards, ``general standards of decency
and respect for the diverse beliefs and values of the American
public.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The court reaffirms the principle that the government cannot
discriminate against unpopular political ideas,'' said Marjorie
Heins, outgoing director of the Arts Censorship Project at the
American Civil Liberties Union and one of the attorneys for the
plaintiffs. ``But at the same time, it is an unrealistic way of
viewing the message this law sends to the NEA and to artists to be
careful and conscious and to censor themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In their original suit, the four performance artists charged
that they were ``blacklisted'' by the NEA for their political
views; Hughes, Miller and Fleck are gay and address their sexuality
in solo performances, and Finley is known for her stridently
feminist material.
</P>
<P>
   Since the suit was filed, the NEA has restructured its
grant-making system, cutting out all grants to individual artists,
channeling most of its funds to state arts councils and limiting
arts institutions to one grant application per year. Congress has
dramatically cut the budget over the years to current allotment of
$98 million.
</P>
<P>
   NEA chairman William J. Ivey, who was on Capitol Hill Thursday
seeking Congressional support for the agency, said in a statement
that he was pleased with the Supreme Court decision. ``The
Endowment's citizen review panels represent the broad diversity of
the American people,'' he said, adding that the agency ``remains
committed to full First Amendment protection.''
</P>
<P>
   The First Amendment was at the heart of Justice David Souter's
lone dissent. He argued that the law should be struck down because
it carries ``a significant power to chill artistic production and
display.''
</P>
<P>
   Arts administrators echoed that sentiment Thursday. ``It is a
dark day,'' said David Ross, executive director of San Francisco's
Museum of Modern Art and former director of the Institute of
Contemporary Art in Boston. ``It is a complete refutation of the
founding principles of the NEA which were to support excellence and
to insulate the process from the winds of politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross and others, however, said that the NEA is becoming
increasingly irrelevant to the nation's nonprofit arts
organizations; it has limited its grant applications to four broad
categories, and it no longer provides general operating support,
which is the hardest money for nonprofits to raise from corporate
and private sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue about government funding is practically moot because
it doesn't exist anymore,'' said Robert Brustein, artistic director
of the American Repertory Theatre in Cambridge, Mass. ART, he said,
received about $800,000 a year from the NEA before the controversy
began; it received $62,500 this year. But he added, ``It's going to
send a chill through the artistic community, and you can already
see it in the conservative and safe choices most theaters are
making.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley, who became widely known as ``the chocolate woman'' for a
performance in which she smeared chocolate and alfalfa sprouts on
her body as a symbol, she said, of oppression against women, was
not available for comment Thursday. Her publicist, however, said
she was going to address the decision in her performance last night
at an alternative theater in the Tri-Beca district of Manhattan.
Her show, ``The Return of the Chocolate Smeared Woman,'' opened
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ACLU attorney Heins said that the court decision left open the
possibility that artists could challenge the law again if they
proved that the law discriminated against their First Amendment
rights. ``It could be revived if such an instance came up, but this
case essentially is over.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is National Endowment for the Arts vs. Finley, 97-371.

 &HT;    Coca-Cola case sales in line with outlook
 &HT;    By Mickey H. Gramig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Coca-Cola said its second-quarter case sales are on
target to surge 9 to 10 percent worldwide, as analysts had
projected.
</P>
<P>
   But what caught some by surprise at the company's bi-annual
investment conference, held at Coca-Cola's headquarters on North
Avenue, was its expectation for a 7 to 8 percent rise in case sales
in its Middle and Far East division. That's where several countries
have been mired in a sharp economic downturn since last year.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the estimate is lower than the division's 11 percent
average volume increase over the last five years, Douglas N. Daft
told analysts and money managers. But it's equal to the 7 to 8
percent increase in case sales the company expects for North
America and ``would indicate that we are managing our business
through this current economic crisis,'' Daft said.
</P>
<P>
   Systemwide, the volume expectations exceed the 7 percent
increase in the year-ago period, and keep the company on track to
post annual earnings-per-share in the high $1.50s to low $1.60s
range, Chairman and Chief Executive M. Douglas Ivester said.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook includes volume increases of 10 to 11 percent for
Latin America and Europe, and 16 to 17 percent for Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The news created a feeding frenzy on Wall Street, where
Coca-Cola's stock hit a record high before closing at $84.87 1/2.
Nearly 5 million Coke shares traded, topping the three-month daily
average of 2.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Daft, whose division accounts for 20 percent of the company's
sales and 25 percent of profits, said Coca-Cola has revised
business plans for every country hit by the ``Asian flu.'' The
actions ``prevented business paralysis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will emerge with an even stronger business than we have
today,'' Daft said.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester agreed, saying the climate has created investment
opportunities that otherwise might not have occurred. For example,
an estimated $450 million bottler deal in Korea ``could have easily
cost us twice as much,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Through hedging, the company usually can limit the impact of
currency fluctuations on its earnings to about 3 percent, but
``1998 is not a year where we can do that,'' said Chief Financial
Officer James E. Chestnut. He stood by earlier estimates that the
impact would be in the 8 or 9 percent range this year. ``As far as
further out, things are just too volatile to say.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ivester was upbeat, painting a portrait of Coca-Cola as a
true growth company, despite its 112 years in business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty percent of our volume comes from places where 20
percent of the world's population lives,'' Ivester said. ``The
steps that we're taking today to grow and evolve the company will
lead to the company of the future.''

 &HT;    GM prepares to close more plants
 &HT;    By Jim Dillon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio -- Thousands more local General Motors Corp.
employees will be sent home as the automaker prepares to literally
turn off the lights at nearly all of its North American plants.
</P>
<P>
   GM is using the massive shutdown, which will extend indefinitely
beyond GM's normal two-week summer break, to conserve cash while it
deals with a crippling strike by the United Auto Workers.
</P>
<P>
   The move would seem to signal that GM is anticipating a long,
drawn-out battle with the UAW.
</P>
<P>
   Strikes by about 9,200 UAW members at two GM plants in Flint,
Mich., have crippled the world's largest automaker, causing it to
lay off more than 147,900 workers throughout the U.S., Canada and
Mexico, and lose an estimated $1 billion in second-quarter profit.
</P>
<P>
   Another 80,000 or so of GM's North American employees remained
on the job Thursday. But only those workers making parts for other
automakers or working on GM's new full-size pickup truck, 1999
Oldsmobile Alero, Pontiac Grand Am and next generation of full-size
cars will escape immediate and indefinite layoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``This action is unparalleled and reflects the critical impact
that this strike is having on our company,'' said GM Vice President
Donald Hackworth in a taped message to GM employees. ``To protect
our company during this crisis, we must reduce all expenditures
that don't impact our future product programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackworth called the move a ``cold shutdown.''
</P>
<P>
   In a memo to plant managers, the automaker also urged them to
cut back on electricity and other utilities and limit any necessary
work to the day shift.
</P>
<P>
   GM's annual two-week shutdown of plants starts this weekend.
Normally, some skilled trades and maintenance workers stay on to do
annual maintenance and prepare for model changes. But that work
won't be done this year and plants will remain closed until a
settlement is reached, a GM spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Flint strikes are entering their third and fourth weeks
respectively. UAW leaders have predicted the strikes could last
into mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   UAW President Stephen Yokich, at his union's constitutional
convention in Las Vegas, said GM's latest actions were a public
relations gimmick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all PR,'' he said. ``Since we went out on strike, they've
done nothing but spin PR instead of going to the bargaining
table.''
</P>
<P>
   GM and its parts subsidiary, Delphi Automotive Systems, employ
about 20,000 people in the Dayton area. More than 7,200 of those
workers already have been laid off as a result of the Flint
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The upcoming shutdown _ unmatched since the UAW's 67-day
national strike against GM in 1970 _ promises to put several
thousand more out of work.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how many more local GM workers will be laid off remains
to be seen because local Delphi plants make parts for other
automakers or are involved in future GM products, said Delphi
spokesman Jim Hagedon.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we will be taking advantage of the shutdown to minimize
costs as much as possible. Then as a general rule, we're going to
halt production except where we are working on critical customer
needs and essential future product programs,'' Hagedon said.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, 910 of 3,900 laid-off workers at the Moraine truck
assembly plant were called back to work Thursday to ``clear the
line'' before it's shut down indefinitely, Hagedon said.
</P>
<P>
   A prolonged shutdown will create more havoc for GM's and
Delphi's many outside suppliers and vendors as well. Local
companies ranging from AK Steel to Jet Express count GM as a major
customer and have expressed deep concern about the strikes'
continuing impact on their businesses.
</P>
<P>
   GM also is cutting its $2 billion advertising budget for at
least the next six weeks, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   As another way to conserve cash, the company also has pledged to
challenge unemployment compensation to workers affected by the
strike.
</P>
<P>
   So far in Ohio, though, the company has not challenged
unemployment benefits granted to non-UAW members, said David
Garick, spokesman for the Ohio Department of Employment Services.
Most hourly GM employees in the Miami Valley are members of other
unions, including the International Union of Electronic Workers and
the United Steel Workers of America.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW does represent about 3,400 hourly workers at two GM
brake plants in Dayton. A hearing on whether those workers should
receive unemployment benefits is scheduled for Aug. 4 in Columbus,
Garick said.
</P>
<P>
   If GM eventually does challenge unemployment compensation paid
to non-UAW members and wins, those workers could be forced to pay
back that money.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 2,279 GM employees in Ohio, most of whom live in the
Dayton area, have applied for unemployment compensation, Garick
said.

 &HT;    Canadian and Ohio officials unite to crackdown on fraudelent
loan companies
 &HT;    By Angela Townsend
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio -- Catherine Sloan thought she had finally found an
answer to her financial woes.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to get out of debt, the Kettering woman sent $443 to a
Canadian company as payment for insurance required to get a $5,000
loan.
</P>
<P>
   Sloan never saw a penny of the loan. The insurance she paid for
didn't exist. And when she tried to get her money back, she learned
the company's phone had been disconnected.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would think I would have known better,'' said Sloan, an
accountant who holds down two jobs. ``I should have paid attention
to my first basic instinct, that it was too good to be true. When
you're desperate, you do desperate things.''
</P>
<P>
   The telemarketing fraud unit of the Ohio attorney general's
office has joined Canadian law enforcement agencies in
investigating bogus Canadian companies that lure people across the
country with empty promises.
</P>
<P>
   This week the two sides raided 27 ``boiler rooms'' of 40 fake
loan companies, arresting 15 people. The companies allegedly had
kept more than $1 million in fees. It's the third sting operation
in the past year in which Ohio officials have assisted.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Verble, spokeswoman for Attorney General Betty Montgomery,
said the company Sloan dealt with was not among those included in
this week's investigation. ``However, these organizations change
their name so fast that they could have ties to one of (the ones
investigated),'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Sloan, 44, spotted a classified ad in the Dayton Daily
News from a company promising loans to people with no credit who
needed money.
</P>
<P>
   It appealed to Sloan, saddled with huge medical bills due to a
lack of insurance. Forced to file for bankruptcy twice, she wanted
to avoid going down the same road again.
</P>
<P>
   She called the ad's 800 number and talked to a man claiming to
be a loan officer. The next day he called Sloan back. She was
approved for a $5,000 loan at 9 percent interest.
</P>
<P>
   Labeled a credit risk, she was told she had to buy long-term
disability insurance worth $443 before the company would process
her loan application.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was money I didn't even have. I had to borrow it,'' Sloan
said. No loan arrived in the four days promised. The explanation:
The company was behind on paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   On May 19, following a series of calls, Sloan was assured her
loan would be mailed in three days. It didn't come. This time she
was told an investor had pulled out. Her application would be
resubmitted after another investor could be found. That could take
up to a month.
</P>
<P>
   Sloan requested a refund of her money. It would take up to four
weeks, the company said. That was the last time she spoke with
them.
</P>
<P>
   When the four weeks passed without a loan check, Sloan called
again. The phones had been disconnected.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes people do get their money back. Last month, 38 states
distributed money to people tricked by a company named Uptown
Financial. More than 25 percent of the Ohio victims were from the
Miami Valley, Verble said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing more of a trend where telemarketers are not just
moving across state lines but international lines as well,'' Verble
said. ``They have a better chance of not getting caught.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to know that this is illegal and it's a scam,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio consumers who are victims of advanced fee loans are urged
to contact the attorney general's office at (800) 282-0515.

 &HT;    Mead prepares for a major restructure
 &HT;    By Mike Drummond
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio -- Mead Corp. will trim 500 workers over the next
three to five years and sell off $100 million of its non-essential
businesses and real estate holdings to out-maneuver a sluggish
paper market and cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton-based paper company also said Thursday it will take
an $80 million charge against its second-quarter earnings for
write-down of assets and losses associated with the sale last week
of its Zellerbach distribution business. Earnings will be released
next month.
</P>
<P>
   Mead, with annual earnings of $150 million last year on revenues
of $5 billion, will slash 250 salaried employees, including
executives, in the coming months as it restructures some of its
businesses and combines its coated paper divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Another 250 salaried employees will be cut from its total
workforce of 14,000 as the company replaces workers with new
``enterprise resource planning'' software in three to five years.
</P>
<P>
   A company spokeswoman said it was too early to say how many of
Mead's 600 local employees would be affected. However, she said
some of those layoffs would be through attrition.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mead predicted it will take a $10 million charge in the
upcoming third quarter and as much as $15 million in future
quarters, it expects the layoffs eventually will save the company
$50 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Also gone will be Mead Ink Products, a sawmill and 50,000 acres
of timber in South Ridge, Mich., undeveloped mill sites in
Tennessee, Kentucky and Michigan, and real estate in San Francisco
and Miamisburg _ 100 acres of land and a building at the Newmark
Center off Ohio 741.
</P>
<P>
   Mead expects to make $100 million off the sale of these assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not content to wait for the marketplace to rebound, and
for prices to rise,'' said Mead Chief Executive Jerome F. Tatar.
``The initiatives announced today are all part of our effort to
drive performance for shareholders regardless of the broader
industry cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   Slumping paper prices, a glut of competitors and lack of
investor interest prompted Mead to make some of its boldest moves
since former Mead CEO Steve Mason cleaned house earlier this
decade. Mason discontinued two businesses, sold and bought sawmills
and unloaded Lexis-Nexis to Reed Elsevier plc for $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In the eight months as Mead's CEO, Tatar has proved he is not
content to coast. He oversaw the purchase this year of a small
specialty paper-producing mill in Potsdam, N.Y. Last week he
announced the sale of Mead's financially troubled Zellerbach
division to International Paper's xpedx division for $263 million,
affecting about 2,200 employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't let a lot of grass grow under his feet,'' said
Kathryn McAuley, an analyst with New York-based Brown Brothers
Harriman.
</P>
<P>
   For decades Mead, one of only two Fortune 500 companies in the
Miami Valley, acquired non-essential pieces to its $5 billion
business. Tatar's housecleaning is a carry-over from Mason's
tenure, McAuley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mantra in the industry is to focus,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   To that end the company also announced Thursday that it is
combining its mills at Escanaba, Mich., Rumford, Maine, and
Chillicothe under one coated paper division.
</P>
<P>
   Tatar also is pulling the purse strings tighter on annual
spending for plant upgrades. After spending millions of dollars to
modernize its Stevenson, Ala., mill, Tatar is capping
capital-improvement spending to about $300 million in 1999 and
2000, down from its current cap of about $450 million.
</P>
<P>
   However, Tatar, as he has done in the past, has not ruled out
acquisitions

REBUFFING GOP CHIEFS, HOUSE PANEL BACKS ARTS ENDOWMENT FUNDING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., N.Y., Wis., Ariz., Ill., N.Y.)   (bl)  
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a surprise slap at Republican leaders, the House
Appropriations Committee voted Thursday in favor of financing the
National Endowment for the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   The vote, 31-27, reversed a subcommittee vote that denied money
to the endowment just last week.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's action, in which five moderate Republicans bolted
from the party line, put on display the deep divisions between
Republican conservatives and moderates and foreshadowed the
problems for party leaders in establishing a coherent message in
this election year.
</P>
<P>
   On the arts matter, Majority Whip Tom DeLay, who had been absent
for the morning vote, spent a frenetic afternoon trying to persuade
the five moderates to change their votes.
</P>
<P>
   The endowment money was attached to the $13.4-billion bill that
keeps the national parks running. That broader bill, with the
measure to provide $98 million for the arts, was approved by voice
vote and sent to the House floor for consideration next month.
Whatever happens on the House floor, money for the arts appears
likely to continue. The Senate has already started approving the
money, and President Clinton has indicated his support.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating taxpayer money for the arts is a priority for
outside conservative groups but is a trickier issue for many
members of Congress. To try to avoid embarrassment, Republican
leaders decided _ and an Appropriations subcommittee agreed last
week by voice vote _ to put no money in the Interior bill for the
endowment but to allow a yes-or-no vote on the House floor later.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to avoid a public squabble in the subcommittee and
the full committee and dispense with the matter in a quick vote on
the floor that would be overshadowed by other votes. But Democrats
set out Thursday to sabotage the plan, and with the unexpected
assist from the five Republicans, they succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin, the top Democrat on the
Appropriations Committee, forced the vote over the objections of
the Appropriations chairman, Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La. No one
spoke against the endowment.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Michael Forbes, R-N.Y., who voted for the endowment, said,
``You can't have Democrats offer up an amendment to fund the NEA
and expect Republicans who support the NEA not to vote for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The four other Republicans joining Forbes were Reps. Rodney
Frelinghuysen of New Jersey, Jim Kolbe of Arizona, John Edward
Porter of Illinois and James Walsh of New York.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Arts was not the only subject Thursday on which Republicans were
at odds with themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The full House had been expected to pass the $13 billion bill to
keep the Treasury and Postal Service operating in the next fiscal
year, which begins Oct. 1. But 155 Republicans joined 135 Democrats
and one independent in sidelining the bill on a procedural vote.
And 60 Democrats and 65 Republicans voted with the Republican
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The bill had two big political problems: it includes a measure
to require that all health-insurance plans for federal employees
cover the full range of contraceptives that they offer for other
prescription drugs. And it dropped an earlier $4-billion commitment
to prepare the government to cope with the computer glitch expected
in the year 2000.

   Another day, another dozen deals.
</P>
<P>
   On a single day in May, Office Depot, an eye on expanding
abroad, agreed to buy Viking Office Products in a $3 billion stock
swap; Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. announced a $1.59 billion
hostile tender offer for Allied Group, an Iowa car and home
insurer; Dillard's, the Midwestern retailer, bought Mercantile
Stores Co. for $2.9 billion; and Cardinal Health, hoping to become
a one-stop service provider for pharmaceutical companies, paid $2.2
billion in stock for R.P. Scherer.
</P>
<P>
   And those were just the biggest fish. In all, 11 proposed deals
with a total value of about $17 billion were announced May 18. It
was a pace an almost unheard of _ or would have been last year or
the year before.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, though, it wasn't so unusual. The growing conviction by
corporations worldwide that bigger is better in the global
marketplace has generated a merger wave that has dwarfed anything
that has preceded it.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the value of mergers and acquisitions
announced through June 25 soared by 153 percent from the same point
a year earlier, to $910 billion, according to Securities Data Corp.

<P>
   Indeed, that number is already just under the total for all of
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, deals doubled to $1.3 trillion, fast approaching the
$1.6 trillion record for all of last year. Acquisitions of
bargain-priced Asian concerns by United States companies are
running at a frenetic pace, and activity in Europe is approaching
record levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all surprised when we open the newspaper Monday
morning,'' said Mac Heller, global head of mergers and acquisitions
at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   The push into foreign markets and the sense these days that no
company is untouchable, and practically no deal is impossible, are
driving many of this year's mergers. Daimler-Benz's $39 billion
merger agreement with Chrysler Corp. last month, for example, will
create a colossus employing 420,000 workers, giving the German
automaker easier access to American buyers and providing Chrysler a
formidable new base in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Even the general public is taking notice. Cyberinvestors swapped
rumors on Internet chat boards weeks before Tyco International and
U.S. Surgical Corp. announced their merger May 25.
</P>
<P>
   An e-mail message making the rounds this spring joked that
Sesame Street's Bert and Ernie were combining to become Bernie. And
two lawyers in a recent episode of ``The Practice,'' a popular
evening television drama, casually threw around terms like M&AMP;A as
they reminisced about their dreams in law school.
</P>
<P>
   The merger boom is driven in part by the exuberant U.S. economy.
Lower interest rates, of course, have made stocks an attractive
place to invest. But most companies are using their own shares to
make acquisitions, for several reasons, said Rick Escherich, a
managing director in the mergers and acquisitions group at J.P.
Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the accounting treatment on many stock deals is
tax-free. Companies that pay cash don't get such a break. Moreover,
low inflation and the sheer size of the deals being done today _
eight mergers in the past three months alone have exceeded $25
billion each, and three have surpassed $60 billion _ usually leaves
debt financing out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, institutional investors are more willing to take stock
as a way to stay fully invested in a given industry.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, there is a growing consensus among corporate
executives that in a global economy, the only choice is between
being one of the top two or three players in an industry or slowly
bleeding to death.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, several high-profile combinations _ including those of
Citicorp with Travelers Group, Nationsbank Corp. with BankAmerica
and Chrysler with Daimler-Benz _ have spurred a new sense of
urgency and a sense that almost anything is possible. Byron Wein,
head U.S. strategist for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co., says
companies are more pressed to grab friendly partners now or become
targets themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There used to be a feeling out there that there were certain
trophy properties and that they'd never trade,'' Wein said. ``Now
the feeling is if Citicorp and Daimler can trade, anything can. If
something unique doesn't go to you, your second alternative may not
be all that desirable.''
</P>
<P>
   What a stretch from the 1980s, when many companies were acquired
in hostile takeover wars, disassembled and then sold in parts to
the highest bidder. Now it is a virtual love fest, with companies
strategically piecing themselves back together to create advantages
they say can only be achieved by merging.
</P>

<P>
   ``Most people understand it's a game of scale and size,'' said
Jack Grubman, a telecommunications analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.
``Having a handful of players at the end of the day will be more
competitive then having thousands of fragmented companies.''
</P>
<P>
   The grab for assets will continue as long as current market
sentiment prevails. And even if the stock market crashes, many on
Wall Street believe, demand for acquisitions will remain strong as
financial buyers looking for bargains enter the fray.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, financial services deals _ including those
involving banks and insurance companies _ have led the way,
totaling $347 billion, or 38 percent of all activity, so far this
year. One reason is that the target companies have such high market
values. ``It used to be that a $3 billion to $5 billion deal was a
significant transaction,'' said Ralph Watts, co-head of mergers and
acquisitions at Salomon Smith Barney. ``That has been eclipsed by
the megadeal.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On April 13, for instance, two mergers _ between Nationsbank and
BankAmerica, and between First Chicago and Banc One _ were
announced and added up to $90 billion in value. Compare that with
last year, when all merger and acquisition activity in the bank and
insurance industry in the first six months tallied about the same
amount.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the sheer number of worldwide deals _ 10,401 so far,
according to Securities Data _ has given every firm on Wall Street
a reason to boast. Morgan Stanley was the adviser for the greatest
number, 182 to date, and aided Britain's Energy Group in its merger
with Texas Utilities Co. Salomon Smith Barney, which is owned by
the Travelers Group, helped engineer the largest merger this year,
the marriage of Travelers and Citicorp. Merrill Lynch often finds
itself across the table from Goldman, Sachs in bank negotiations.
And Credit Suisse First Boston had the ear of AT&AMP;T when it
announced the acquisition of Tele-Communications Inc. on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the real bragging rights belong to Goldman, Sachs. which not
only had a hand in eight of the 10 largest deals this year but also
advised on 160 transactions valued at $549 billion, the largest
dollar volume by far of any investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership's client list is a register of the world's
corporate elite. These include Monsanto, Ameritech, Daimler-Benz.
But this year's showing is due, in particular, to Goldman's
high-powered financial-institutions team, which represented, among
others, BankAmerica, First Chicago and Wells Fargo.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Heller of Goldman says he is puzzled by all the
attention given mergers these days. On a recent trip to his
hometown of Dayton, Ohio, he was cornered in a grocery store by an
old school chum who quizzed him on the hottest merger prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of made me sad,'' he recalled wistfully. ``The main
event for the economy is how good a job companies are doing in
delivering products and services. Not the merger business. Not Wall
Street. Not Goldman, Sachs.''
</P>
<P>
   He has a point. Despite this buoyant market, chief executives
still have some basic issues to address to insure success, said
Mark Maybell, an investment banker at Merrill Lynch. For one thing,
they have to deliver on promises made in announcing the deal or
their stock will take a hit later. Every combination has to pass
regulatory review. And management has to integrate the corporate
cultures successfully or both customers and staff will bolt.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is not an entirely new phenomenon, more chief
executives are merging their offices as well as their companies by
naming themselves co-chief executives. The arrangement keeps both
leaders in the spotlight and gainfully employed, although few such
marriages of convenience last between people who are not accustomed
to sharing power.
</P>
<P>
   In recent hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Joel
Klein, head of the antitrust division of the Department of Justice,
said his agency would not restrict mergers based on size, but would
continue to scrutinize combinations for their effects on
competition and pricing. He warned, however, that he would look
with disfavor on any companies that plead the need to expand in a
global economy as an excuse to create entities that stifle
competition at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mere invocation of increased globalization as a purported
rationale for a merger does not result in a free pass from
competitive review,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   The big question _ one that won't be answered for several years
_ is whether the 1990s will be remembered as a successful retooling
of larger, more competitive corporations or just another era of
Wall Street hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have a stable economy, people are going to say we did
smart things,'' said Gary Parr, head of mergers and acquisitions at
Morgan Stanley. But if the economy turns sharply down, he added,
``they are going to say these people got carried away.''

CATHOLICS, LUTHERANS TO SIGN DECLARATION ON SALVATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a decision designed to resolve an issue that split the
Western Christian world nearly 500 years ago, the Vatican said
Thursday that it will sign a joint declaration with the world's
Lutherans affirming that Catholics and Lutherans share a basic
understanding of how human beings receive God's forgiveness and
salvation.
</P>
<P>
   The document, approved last week by the Lutheran World
Federation, declares that Catholics and Lutherans have found an
essential common ground on the issue of ``justification,'' the
action by which a human being is made worthy of salvation in God's
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The Reformation leader Martin Luther held that justification
comes solely through faith in God, while the Catholic church taught
that a person's good works play a role.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in agreeing that forgiveness and salvation come only
through God's grace but that good works flow from that, Catholics
and Lutherans have come to show a new appreciation for basic
elements in each other's teachings, as a result of years of
biblical scholarship, inter-church dialogue and a renunciation of
age-old stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the Vatican's position in Rome, Cardinal Edward
Cassidy, president of the Pontifical Council for Promoting
Christian Unity, said, ``I wish to stress that the consensus
reached on the doctrine of justification, despite its limitations,
virtually resolves a long disputed question at the close of the
20th century, on the eve of the new millenium.''
</P>
<P>
   But both Cassidy and the Vatican, in its official statement,
said that areas of considerable disagreement remained and required
further discussion between the two sides. The cardinal also said
the declaration ``has limits,'' in that it does not address major
differences between Catholics and Lutherans on such issues as
authority in the church and the ministry.
</P>
<P>
   But the cardinal said a formal signing would take place in the
fall, along with ``a celebration of the consensus.''
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic-Lutheran declaration, a carefully-nuanced document
based on 30 years of discussions between Catholic and Lutheran
theologians, sets forth a ``common understanding of
justification.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Together we confess,'' the declaration states at one point,
``by grace alone'' human beings are ``accepted by God and receive
the Holy Spirit,'' which renews their hearts and calls them to good
works. It then goes on to acknowledge specific differences in
Catholic and Lutheran understandings of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   In accepting the document, called ``The Joint Declaration on the
Doctrine of Justification,'' Catholics and Lutherans agreed that
the anathemas they hurled at each other in the 16th Century, as
Europe slid into a devastating period of religious warfare, no
longer apply.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration's official acceptance by both the Vatican and
the Lutheran federation represents a triumph for supporters of the
ecumenical movement, which has urged closer cooperation among
different churches.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It comes at a time of growing awareness among Christians,
particularly in the United States and Europe, of the need to
respond to challenges posed by a growing religious pluralism, in
the emergence of faiths like Islam and Buddhism, as well as by the
rise of a secularism that is deeply wary of the public expression
of religion in society.
</P>
<P>
   Ten months ago, for example, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in
America, the nation's largest Lutheran denomination, entered into a
formal agreement for close cooperation with three smaller
Protestant denominations, allowing for exchange of clergy members
and sharing of communion among members.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Daniel Martensen, ecumenical officer for the
Evangelical Lutherans, said the moves toward closer cooperation
represented ``a change of mood'' among churches as the next
millenium approaches.
</P>
<P>
   In practical terms, Catholic and Lutheran officials said the
declaration will ease tensions between the two faith groups in
regions like Latin America and Eastern Europe, while encouraging
broader cooperation, such as in shared social service programs for
the poor, in nations like the United States where relations between
the churches are good.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from Rome, Cardinal William Keeler,
archbishop of Baltimore, said, ``The big point is, we're announcing
consensus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an agreement that is solid,'' he said. ``Cardinal Cassidy
made it clear that this is something that the church is not going
to step back from.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeler said condemnations exchanged between Catholics and
Lutherans in the 16th Century were based partly on stereotypes and
caricatures of each other. ``When you get into a polarized
situation, and just are talking at each other, you don't really
hear what each other is saying,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Luther, a German monk born in 1483, became convinced that
salvation was a divine gift that humans could not earn, after an
inner struggle and a searching reading of St. Paul's Letter to the
Romans in the New Testament.
</P>
<P>
   Declaring that he felt ``reborn'' by this realization, Luther
also became fiercely critical of the medieval church's practice of
selling ``indulgences,'' by which believers understood they could
purchase a divine remission for their transgressions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1517, he nailed his criticisms, in the form of 95 theses, to
a church door in Wittenburg, Germany, a gesture considered the
opening shot of the Reformation. Attempts by the church to
discipline him failed, his influence grew and he was
excommunicated.
</P>
<P>
   Brother Jeffrey Gros, a specialist in ecumenical affairs at the
National Conference of Catholic Bishops, said the joint declaration
would serve as an ``enormous encouragement'' to Catholics and
Lutherans already working together on various social and religious
projects in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he found it encouraging that the Vatican had
officially called for clarifications of parts of the declaration,
rather than raising outright objections.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from Cassidy's remarks, the Vatican's official statement
alternately praises and criticizes the declaration. Although the
statement says that ``a high degree of agreement has been reached''
in the Catholic-Lutheran dialogue, it points of out areas of
serious difference.
</P>
<P>
   The most important, according to the statement, is the Lutheran
belief that a person can be both justified by God and yet still a
sinner. The Vatican statement said it ``remains difficult to see''
how this doctrine ``is not touched'' by the 16th century anathemas
pronounced against Lutheran teachings by the Catholics' Council of
Trent.
</P>
<P>
   But in raising such questions, the Vatican statement also said
that the Catholic church wanted ``to contribute towards
overcoming'' differences between the two Christian groups.
</P>
<P>
   Lutherans gave final approval to the declaration on June 16, in
a unanimous decision of the governing council of the Lutheran World
Federation, meeting in Geneva, Switzerland. The federation
represents 124 churches in 69 nations.
</P>
<P>
   One council member, the Rev. Susan Nagle, pastor of First
Lutheran Church in Montclair, N.J., said that the work that went
into consideration of the joint declaration enhanced the role of
the federation among Lutherans worldwide. ``Within Lutheranism,
something monumental has happened here, not only with Roman
Catholics, but with our understanding,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're beginning to see the Lutheran World Federation as a
communion of churches with authority to speak for each other,''
Pastor Nagle said.
</P>
<P>
   Momentum for the joint declaration had been building for years.
The top policy-making body of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in
America, its Churchwide Assembly, voted overwhelmingly in favor of
the document last summer.
</P>
<P>
   But Lutheran and Catholic scholars in the United States had
reached substantial agreement on the issue of justification long
before. In 1983, on the 500th anniversary of Luther's birth, a
joint team of 20 scholars, sponsored by Catholic bishops and
Lutheran churches, issued a study declaring a shared view that
salvation came through God's grace and that old differences need
not be ``church-dividing.''
</P>
<P>
   That same year, Pope John Paul II gave the Catholic-Lutheran
dialogue a push by praising Luther in a letter to a German
cardinal. Luther, the pope wrote, was a man of ``profound
religiousness.'' &QL;

TRIPP SUBPOENAED TO TESTIFY BEFORE GRAND JURY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Linda Tripp, who secretly recorded conversations
with Monica Lewinsky that triggered a criminal investigation of
President Clinton's sex life, has been subpoenaed to testify next
week before a federal grand jury investigating the case.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp, who turned over the tapes to independent counsel Kenneth
Starr, is scheduled to testify Tuesday, her attorney confirmed late
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Her appearance comes as Starr tries to negotiate an agreement
with Lewinsky's lawyers _ Jacob Stein and Plato Cacheris _ for her
to cooperate in the investigation into whether Clinton or close
associates engaged in a cover-up of his alleged sexual misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   The president and Lewinsky have denied under oath having sex.
Clinton has publicly said his relationship with Lewinsky was not
sexual and that he never urged anyone to lie.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp's tapes reportedly tell a different story as Lewinsky
alleges in telephone conversations that she had an 18-month sexual
affair with the president and that he encouraged her to lie about
their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes also reportedly indicate that Lewinsky asked Tripp to
help cover up a White House encounter between Clinton and Kathleen
Willey, a Democratic activist who testified that the president
groped her and kissed her. Clinton has denied any improper behavior
involving Willey.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the grand jury that subpoenaed Tripp heard Thursday
from White House adviser Sidney Blumenthal, who told reporters that
he provided the panel with details of conversations with the
president and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton about Lewinsky. It
was the third appearance for Blumenthal, who earlier refused to
answer some questions on the grounds of executive privilege.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president shared his account of the Lewinsky matter with
me unguardedly and freely under the assumption that we were
speaking in complete privacy,'' Blumenthal said. ``What I told the
grand jury under oath supports what the president has told the
American people and is contrary to any charge that the president
has done anything wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal's attorney, William McDaniel, again criticized
Starr's grand jury inquiry, calling it ``not only illegal but
unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Too many of the questions posed by Starr's deputies dealt with
how the president and his advisers wrestled with questions from the
news media and the independent counsel's office about Lewinsky,
McDaniel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is supposedly a serious investigation into the man who
occupies the highest office in the land,'' said McDaniel, who
characterized the questions put to Blumenthal as ``sophomoric,
silly, insulting to the grand jury and ... certainly insulting to
the president.''

SAKS IS FOR SALE, BUT BUYERS APPEAR WANTING 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To the average New York shopper, Saks Fifth Avenue
might seem like the ultimate acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   There is the landmark name. The chic frocks. Tourists from
around the world flock to buy anything bearing the store's logo. A
first trip to Saks in search of a bridal gown or lipstick is a rite
of passage for New Yorkers who regard shopping as a serious sport.
</P>
<P>
   But for the average investment bank actually trying to sell the
retail legend, name and cachet do not so easily equal a deal.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Saks Holdings Inc., the holding company for the retailer, said
Thursday that its board, as expected, had approved a sale or merger
of the company, and retained Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. and Merrill Lynch
&AMP; Co. to assist.
</P>
<P>
   An acquisition or merger of the 97-store chain would end the
ownership of Investcorp International, the Bahrain-based investment
bank, which holds the majority stake in the retailer. Saks was
bought by Investcorp in 1990 for $1.6 billion, and the company sold
20 percent of Saks to the public in 1995 for $25 a share, or $425
million.
</P>
<P>
   Most retail analysts and investment bankers will not discuss
potential buyers, largely because they are hoping to get some
banking business of their own from one. But all the potential
acquirers are known to them because the department store universe
has gotten increasingly small as stores like B. Altman have closed
and others like Macy's have fallen under the umbrella of giant
chains like Federated Department Stores Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Federated, which owns Bloomingdale's, Macy's, Sterns and several
other chains, would seem like the biggest player in the game. But
the fit does not seem perfect. Federated has been focusing on every
place except New York in recent years, rolling out Bloomingdale's
in California and eyeing potential acquisitions in the Midwest,
where it has no presence.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the chairman of Saks, Philip Miller, has taken the
store on an interesting strategic journey. Miller tossed out the
clothing lines that are the bread and butter of Federated stores,
like Liz Claiborne, in favor of pricier lines like Dolce &AMP; Gabbana.
The move increased sales for Saks, but it also means that the store
has little in common with Federated or the giant May Department
Stores Co., which owns Lord &AMP; Taylor, another store less snazzy
than Saks.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there is Nordstrom Inc. ``It would be a real step up for
them,'' said Walter Loeb, the retail consultant. ``It would give
them greater access to name brands.'' But shares of Nordstrom are
held largely by the retailer's founding family, and it seems
unlikely that they would be willing to do a stock transaction to
acquire Saks.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows, of course, how much Saks could fetch, but luxury
retailers tend to be valued at roughly eight-tenths to 1{ times
revenues, which would put the price for Saks roughly between $1.8
billion and $2.5 billion. Few retail companies have that kind of
cash. Further, supplier synergies would be limited, especially
since Nordstrom has a totally decentralized regional buying
structure.
</P>
<P>
   Neiman Marcus, a unit of Harcourt General, is another potential
buyer. The two companies sell similar high-end merchandise and have
similar customers. They have been stomping around each other's
territory for a few years _ Saks has gone into Houston and Dallas,
Neiman has opened stores recently on the East Coast _ and have
privately expressed interest in each other in the past.
</P>
<P>
   But if the two were to get together, could an antitrust argument
result? Outside of Barneys New York, which is tiny compared with
those two, and dozens of small specialty stores around the country,
Saks and Neiman are truly the only national outlets for the Giorgio
Armani and Jil Sander's lines. Miller has also put an emphasis on
scaled-down Saks in small cities, like Greenwich, Conn., further
tightening the retailer's grip on the luxury market.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``If manufacturers feel they benefit from bargaining one of
these stores against the other,'' said Richard Steuer, an antitrust
lawyer at Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays &AMP; Handler, ``they would have
the kind of argument the government would listen to.''
</P>
<P>
   Steuer pointed to the scuttled merger between Staples Inc. and
Office Depot Inc. last year, a union the government found a threat
to free trade. ``Even though this takes the issue from the mundane
to the sublime, the question of their ability to have a lock on a
certain universe of sellers remains,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   International retailers are another option. LVMH Moet Hennessy
Louis Vuitton is said to have already looked and moved on. Dickson
Concepts Inc. has been badly hammered because of the Asian
recession. Harrods Department Store in London is a good
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   And there is always the possibility that Saks executives could
try to raise enough cash to buy the retailer outright.

REPUBLICAN LEADERS OUTLINE LOW-BUDGET TOBACCO BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Mo.)  (mk) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Preparing to leave town for a two-week recess,
Republican leaders in the House of Representatives Thursday offered
a sketchy outline of the kind of low-budget tobacco legislation
they favor.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan is meant as an alternative to the ambitious
anti-smoking bill that was shelved by the Senate last week. The
centerpiece of the plan would be an advertising campaign to
discourage teen-age smoking and drug use modeled after the national
campaign to encourage people to use seat belts in cars.
</P>
<P>
   The details of the legislation have not been completed.
According to a one-page outline distributed Thursday, the bill
would not raise cigarette prices and would apparently diminish the
authority of the Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco
products.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, states and communities would be encouraged to
penalize teen-agers caught smoking by taking away their driver's
licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Deborah Pryce, R-Ohio, appointed by Speaker Newt Gingrich
to be the party's spokeswoman on tobacco issues in the House,
called the Republican approach ``strong common-sense legislation''
that would ``reduce teen smoking without increasing taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and representatives of public health organizations
responded that Republicans' measures would have no affect on
teen-age smoking and amounted to a handshake with the tobacco
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader, called it
a fig leaf.
</P>
<P>
   The inability of the Republicans to agree on such details as how
much the advertising campaign would cost and how it would be
financed and the antagonistic response of Democrats and public
health authorities to Thursday's announcement reinforced the
growing view in the Capitol that no tobacco legislation will get
through Congress this year.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Gingrich promised that the party's legislative
proposal would be introduced this week, but obviously some details
could not be worked out. A lobbyist who has good connections with
Republican lawmakers said that the framework for legislation was
announced Thursday _ adding little to what Republican leaders had
already described as their intentions _ so that Republicans could
say at home over the recess that they planned to do something about
teen-age smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats hope to make a campaign issue out of the fact that
Republicans are the main beneficiaries of political donations by
the tobacco industry and the principal opponents of legislation
that the industry opposes.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, the fourth-ranking member of the
House Republican leadership, described the Republican philosophy
this way: ``I think the American people understand that teen-agers
are going to smoke. It's one of those rites of passage, if you
will. But we ought to make it as difficult as possible, without
imposing higher taxes and bigger government on the rest of the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Boehner, a smoker himself, said the leadership intended to bring
the legislation before the House under procedures that would not
allow amendments.

<P>
   PALERMO, Sicily _ Thursday was supposed to be a day of triumph
and liberation, as thousands of Italian soldiers began pulling out
of Sicily after a six-year military operation to restore order in a
land virtually ruled by the Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   But as regular police officers in blue uniforms took up the
vacated posts in front of the Palace of Justice, prosecutors' homes
and other buildings at high risk of attack, many Sicilians seemed
mournful.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those of us who have lived it, the emergency is not
over,'' complained Rita Borsellino, a pharmacist whose brother, a
prominent anti-Mafia prosecutor, was killed by a car bomb in 1992.
``The soldiers had a deterrent effect, and they symbolized the
active presence of the state. The war is still going on, so why
stop now?''
</P>
<P>
   The killing of Paolo Borsellino and his partner, Giovanni
Falcone, by the Mafia traumatized Italian society and galvanized it
to wage an all-out war against organized crime. It was those
slayings that prompted the government to send troops to Sicily.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian government decided to withdraw its troops for
reasons both practical and symbolic: Many of the most dangerous
Mafia bosses have been captured, Palermo is relatively peaceful,
and the cost of maintaining a military presence here is high. And
Italy, which recently was admitted to the European monetary union,
wants to shed the image of a nation that needs a peacekeeping force
occupying its own territory.
</P>
<P>
   But many prosecutors insist that the war against the Sicilian
Mafia is by no means won, and argue that for other practical and
symbolic reasons, it would be better for the army to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether a retreat of the army at this time is
opportune,'' said Piero Luigi Vigna, Italy's chief organized-crime
prosecutor, who lobbied to keep the soldiers in place. ``It could
be interpreted as a sign that the state is reducing its attention
to organized crime in Sicily.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the killings of Falcone and Borsellino, who are revered as
martyrs of the anti-Mafia crusade, the government has rotated
150,000 servicemen through Sicily, about 4,000 at a time. With
soldiers standing guard, thousands of police officers were freed to
help with investigative work. In the last few years, hundreds of
Mafia members have been arrested and convicted, including figures
like Salvatore Riina, the ``boss of bosses,'' who was given a life
sentence last year for his role in the killing of Falcone.
</P>
<P>
   No prosecutors have been killed since the army arrived, and that
alone has led many to conclude that the most dangerous crime
networks have been dismantled. But that opinion is not shared by
judges and prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mafia has been dealt a harsh blow, but it is an
organization that knows how to restructure and survive in bad
times,'' said Gian Carlo Caselli, the chief prosecutor in Palermo.
``It has gone underground, but the Mafia wouldn't be the Mafia
unless it had deep alliances in the world of politics and high
finance.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``We can't just arrest gangsters. We have to keep
investigating those murkier relationships.'' Like his colleagues,
Caselli still has a phalanx of armed bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   Palermo is less palpably tense than it was in 1992, when car
bombs and brutal assassinations in broad daylight were an almost
weekly event. There are a few vivid signs of new-found normalcy:
The 19th century neo-classical opera house, Teatro Massimo,
reopened in April with a performance of ``Aida.'' It was closed for
minor repairs in 1974, but renovation funds were siphoned off by
the Mafia as they were for hundreds of public works projects in
Italy's South.
</P>
<P>
   Around the opera house, however, the luxuriant city center is
still marked with neglected buildings and hideous high-rises, a
testimony to how the Mafia, with the collusion of corrupt elected
officials, misused public funds. And despite recent efforts to
revitalize the center, the inhabitants are still leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Borsellino, whose family had worked as pharmacists for five
generations, finally abandoned her pharmacy in the city center for
a more populated area in the suburbs three days ago. ``I held out
as long as I could,'' she said. ``But the fact that they are
planning to restore some of the historic center doesn't mean they
can make it live again.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other endemic problems that keep the Mafia
well-rooted, including staggeringly high unemployment, which has
reached 60 percent among the young. Extortion, a Mafia mainstay, is
stronger than ever, according to law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials say that even though there is much work to be
done, it is time for the army to leave. ``Six years ago, it seemed
we had no strength left to fight the Mafia, and we needed
extraordinary measures to do something,'' Antonio Manganelli,
Palermo's chief of police, said. ``But all extraordinary measures
must have a beginning and an end.''
</P>
<P>
   Manganelli said he had been sent 800 new police officers to take
over the security work done by the army.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mafia is too deeply infiltrated into our society to be
rooted out quickly or easily,'' he warned. ``It's going to take
years, and we will have successes and terrible failures again. As
far as I'm concerned, this is just the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors, however, complain that the symbolism of the troop
withdrawal is compounded by the reality of recent changes in the
law and public attitudes on how to fight crime. Also, a law passed
after the killing of Falcone and Borsellino allowing prosecutors to
isolate Mafia suspects in maximum security cells was reversed this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``These reforms were made with the noblest of intentions, I'm
sure,'' Vigna, the prosecutor, complained. ``But they give
organized crime an immense opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers stationed in Sicily say they see progress, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is better than when we arrived,'' said Capt.
Paolo Bartolini, 34, of the 11th Alpine Regiment, which served five
tours in Sicily since 1992. ``We can pull out, I think, but the
people here are not ready to let us go.''
</P>
<P>
   And citizens of Palermo agree. ``We felt more protected while
they were here _ you could go out at night,'' said Gaetano Rizzo,
40, a butcher. ``At first it was a little strange, seeing soldiers
everywhere, but they are nice, decent kids and we took to them.
They were our own thing, our good `cosa nostra.'''

IMF'S NEW ECONOMIC PLAN FOR INDONESIA ADDS BILLIONS TO TAB 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ The International Monetary Fund reached an
agreement Thursday that paves the way for resuming aid to Indonesia
for the first time since President Suharto resigned in May, but it
warned that economic conditions have worsened so quickly that the
country will need billions more in emergency aid.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing an economic reform plan Thursday, the fourth since
Indonesia's economic crisis began in October, IMF officials
predicted that the country's economy would shrink more than 10
percent this year. Independent economists expect the recession to
be much worse, and the World Bank predicted earlier this week that
by the end of the year 40 percent of the population would fall
below the poverty line, a huge setback for a nation that a year ago
seemed to be a model for developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   When the IMF first put together an economic aid plan for
Indonesia, it estimated that the country would need $43 billion in
emergency loans, some from the IMF, some from the World Bank and
the Asian Development Bank, and some committed by individual
countries. That figure included a $3 billion commitment from
Washington, none of which has yet been sent to Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   But in a statement Thursday, the IMF said $43 billion would not
be enough. It called for an additional $4 billion to $6 billion,
though it did not indicate where the money might come from.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``At this critical moment, we are seeking further support of the
international community to insure the success of our economic
program,'' said the country's new agreement with the IMF It was
made public after Hubert Neiss, the Asia-Pacific director of the
IMF, met with Indonesian President B.J. Habibie on Thursday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Neiss also announced that the Asian Development Bank approved a
$1.5 billion loan Thursday to strengthen the crippled banking
sector and help close the budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   The new economic plan is similar to the last three: It calls for
government austerity and high interest rates to contain inflation
and support Indonesia's currency. But there are growing fears that
the strategy is failing, with most Indonesian businesses unable to
borrow money or pay back previous loans.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF now projects that inflation will run at about 80 percent
over the next year, largely because the price of imported goods has
soared as the value of Indonesia's currency, the rupiah, has
dropped. The plan optimistically calls for the rupiah to stabilize
at a rate of about 10,000 to the dollar by year's end, compared
with about 2,400 to the dollar before the crisis began.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, however, the rupiah is trading at about 16,000 to the
dollar, weaker than it was in the days leading up to Suharto's
forced resignation. That reflects a growing skepticism among
investors that the country can recover anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Neiss said the decision on whether to release the next
installment of aid, about $1 billion, will come at the next meeting
of the IMF's executive board July 8. He said he expected it to be
approved. Aid was suspended during the political turmoil in late
April and May that led to the end of Suharto's 32-year rule.
</P>
<P>
   Release of the aid is regarded as a crucial step in restoring
some degree of confidence in the Indonesian economy, which has seen
trade come to a virtual standstill, record unemployment and a
currency worth one-sixth what it was worth in August.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new agreement, the government will continue subsidies
for food and fuel to minimize the burden on the poor. But those
subsidies are costing the government billions at a time when
revenues have fallen to nearly zero. That is why the IMF sought
additional aid Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It remains our objective, however, to phase out subsidies as
output and household incomes recover,'' the IMF's statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Daragh Maher, an analyst at ING Barings in Singapore, described
the concessions to the poor as necessary to give the Indonesian
economy a chance to recover. He described the assumptions in the
agreement as ``falling on the optimistic end of expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Kwik Kian Gie, a prominent Indonesian economist, said the
figures in the latest agreement were ``daring'' given that other
economists expect the economy to shrink by 15 percent to 20 percent
this year. ``Nobody, including the IMF, can make assumptions in
times of uncertainty,'' he said.

COMMENTARY: SCEPTER'D ISLE SENDS ENVOYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By RUSSELL BAKER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ No, I am not shocked by news that writers for The
Boston Globe and The New Republic have been serving up fiction
dressed as fact.
</P>
<P>
   They shouldn't have done it. Of course not. But let the truth be
said: Few forms of human activity lend themselves so readily to
fakery as journalism.
</P>
<P>
   There is, to begin with, the tradition of the ``source.'' The
``source'' must be protected at all costs. Rather than tell anyone
who the ``source'' is, the reporter must be willing to hang
shackled to dungeon walls or do time on a chain gang.
</P>
<P>
   Betraying a ``source'' is as unspeakable as a New York cop
telling investigators which of his colleagues beat the prisoners
with knouts and horsewhips. Betraying a ``source'' is to dishonor
the profession, as journalists are apt to miscall their trade when
they assemble to be solemn about themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a profession, of course. The journalist is always a
hired hand, and there is always a boss who can have his head at a
whim if angry enough to challenge the journalist's union.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the journalist has something akin to a code of ethics,
and one ironbound rule is that a ``source'' must never be betrayed.
The problem about ``sources'' is that, because their existence is
known only to the journalist, it is possible for them not to exist
at all.
</P>
<P>
   The tradition makes the news business vulnerable to the
unscrupulous and the lazy. There are plenty like that in all lines
of work, journalism included.
</P>
<P>
   When the competition becomes murderous, as in the Monica
Lewinsky story, for instance, the temptation to invent ``sources''
can obviously lead to perdition for a reporter with an insecure
boss leaning on him to produce something ... anything ... fast!
</P>
<P>
   What we are talking about is simply cheating. You encounter a
lot of it every day in many a realm; why suppose that the
percentage of it among journalists is lower?
</P>
<P>
   ``Scoop,'' Evelyn Waugh's classic and hilarious satire on
journalism, supposes an utterly unprincipled business in which
fakery is a way of life. In ``Scoop,'' everything is fraudulent,
including the hero, an innocent nature lover forced to pass himself
off as an ace war correspondent because of a stupid publisher and
cynical editors.
</P>
<P>
   Waugh's reporters file three- and four-word messages from a
primitive jungle state with a war in progress. These are expanded
by editors in London into sensational accounts of events that
didn't happen. The competition is incredible and everybody
conspires in inventing the news.
</P>
<P>
   Competition's devastating effect on careful journalism is
brutally and embarrassingly illustrated by Steven Brill's article,
``Pressgate,'' in the first issue of his new magazine, Content.
Brill's study describes something like a media panic that occurred
with the Monica Lewinsky story.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure not to be scooped, news people published whatever
was ``out there,'' without pausing to confirm it by the usual
methods or, sometimes, even to discuss whether it was worth
throwing at the public.
</P>
<P>
   Now that television never sleeps, it needs round-the-clock news,
and on an intensely competitive story he who stops long enough to
check must lose the race. This, at any rate, is what apologists for
the TV networks told Brill.
</P>
<P>
   All this brings back memories of working in Fleet Street, London
headquarters of the British press, 40 years ago. Waugh's ``Scoop''
was based on Fleet Street's popular journalism, and his point was
that it was ridiculously fraudulent. It was indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Anything went. There the farce was often richer than Waugh's.
For example:
</P>
<P>
   During the early 1950s the Iranian government was in the hands
of one Mohammad Mossadegh, who had infuriated the big powers by
threatening to take charge of his nation's oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   To stop this nonsense, the CIA was engineering his ruin and
working to put the Shah in power. Reporters fell upon Tehran like
locusts.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Express scooped the world one morning in 1953 with a
bylined story from its ace foreign correspondent. ``I saw Mossadegh
hanged today,'' was the opening sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Mossadegh died 13 years later. That was Fleet Street. Now the
Brits are everywhere in American journalism, Lord save us.

AGASSI SERVES HIMSELF OUT OF TOURNEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ It was another four seasons in one day at
Wimbledon, with things a warm, bright, rainy, chilly step away from
the surreal. No wonder 28-year-old Andre Agassi, dressed in a
billowing white smock of Byronic vintage above black undershorts
that smacked of 21st century technology, discovered himself out on
Centre Court locked in a May-December entanglement.
</P>
<P>
   His opponent was none other than Tommy Haas, the 20-year-old
German who replaced the Las Vegan in the role of teacher's pet at
Nick Bollettieri's tennis think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday the last best thought, and shot, in a roller coaster
duel that had been halted by darkness on Wednesday night, belonged
to the 44th-ranked Haas, who remained calm and directed and pulled
off a 4-6, 6-1, 7-6 (7-4), 6-4 upset that provided the floundering
Agassi with yet another setback.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Agassi, who commandeered this slam six years ago, the
brand new French Open champion, Carlos Moya, and the 1989 French
Open champion, Michael Chang, also made premature departures from
Wimbledon Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   On the women's side, both of the teen-aged Williams sisters, the
seventh-seeded Venus and the 20th-ranked Serena, stayed on target
for a sibling spat in the fourth round by posting straight-set
victories over their overwhelmed opponents. Serena clobbered
16-year-old Mirjana Lucic, 6-3, 6-0, and Venus set a women's record
with a 125-miles-per-hour serve in the course of her 6-1, 6-2
demolition of Austria's Barbara Schett.
</P>
<P>
   But Jennifer Capriati's wild-card bid to reassert herself at
Wimbledon was thwarted, 4-6, 6-4, 6-2, by another wild card, Lori
McNeil. ``I'm pretty heartbroken, especially because I think I
really had the match, should have won it,'' said Capriati, who
controlled the opening set but failed to adjust to the windy
conditions, as well as McNeil's chipping-and-charging, when the two
returned to court after an hour-long rain delay. Capriati was a
serve away from leveling the second set at 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conditions changed, I hit a few shaky shots, and she
gained confidence,'' said Capriati, who wasn't the same player in
the latter stages of the match.
</P>
<P>
   Like Capriati, the new French Open champion, Moya, failed to
handle the rain delay with the requisite resilience.
</P>
<P>
   Moya, who said he'd be king of the world for the space of the
two weeks that separate Roland Garros from Wimbledon, failed to
receive the royal treatment from Morocco's 59th-ranked Hicham Arazi
and made a humble exit from the same Centre Court where he had
hoped to hold court long enough to make Pete Sampras fear for his
No. 1 ranking.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the break, I was a completely different player; I don't
know what happened, but nothing worked anymore,'' lamented the
fifth-seeded Moya, after he was ousted 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4. He had
been considered the likeliest of the quartet of seeded Spaniards to
adjust his game to these unpredictable lawns.
</P>
<P>
   But Moya's demise wasn't as surprising as Agassi's. After all,
this was only Moya's fifth match at Wimbledon, but the selective
seeding committee was so certain that Agassi's prior laurels here
presaged a possible breakthrough performance that they upgraded him
from his ranking of 19th to the No. 13 slot. To his own dismay, he
didn't play like a man who deserved the promotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't deserve to win today, didn't do what I needed to
do,'' said Agassi, whose killer instinct isn't what it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   As if he hasn't had enough trouble re-inventing himself as a
slam contender after last year's nosedive to 141st in the computer
rankings, here was Agassi face-to-face with just the sort of
strapping, scrapping player designed to make has-beens of the older
generation. Not to mention this was an upstart whose mission was
personal, not generic: Haas was out to prove a point _ that he's
graduated from the ranks of potential threats to present threats.
He convinced Agassi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not out there for my health, but it even took Michael
Jordan a year before he was playing his best again,'' Agassi said.
``Right now I feel like I have a lot more to do with some of these
defeats than my opponents.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi doublefaulted in the sixth game of the final set to lose
the service break he'd gained in its opening game, the first game
of this heldover match. Another Agassi doublefault gave Haas a
first match point to practice on, and an errant backhand gave the
underdog his second match point chance, a chance he converted when
Agassi pumped a forehand wide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this road real well,'' said Agassi, who lost in the
first round to another of tennis' young Turks, 18-year-old Marat
Safin, earlier this month at the French Open.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Chang, unseeded at a slam for just the second time in a
decade, was upset by Sweden's Magnus Gustafsson, 6-2, &UR;  &LR; 5-7, 6-2,
1-6, 6-2.

JUSTICES UPHOLD ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE, DEAL SETBACK FOR STARR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected independent
counsel Kenneth Starr's effort to see a lawyer's notes from
conversations with White House aide Vincent Foster shortly before
his death.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-3 ruling affirmed the long-held principle that
conversations between a client and his attorney are confidential,
even after the client is dead.
</P>
<P>
   The high court's decision was a setback for Starr, who wanted
access to three pages of notes taken by lawyer James Hamilton
during his July 11, 1993, meeting with Foster, a deputy White House
counsel who committed suicide nine days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been generally, if not universally, accepted for well
over a century that the attorney-client privilege survives the
death of the client in a case such as this,'' Chief Justice William
Rehnquist wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
   At issue was whether Starr could use Hamilton's notes in the
investigation of staff firings at the White House travel office and
whether first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton lied when she denied
playing a role in the dismissals.
</P>
<P>
   Foster, a long-time law partner of the first lady, would have
been a key witness in the travel office inquiry. Seven employees
were fired shortly after President Clinton took office and a
relative of the president's was put in charge of the travel
operation.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady and presidential aides have said she played no
role in the firings _ a position contradicted in a memo by White
House staffer David Watkins. The memo says Foster ``regularly
informed me'' of the first lady's ``insistence'' that the travel
office employees be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to working with Hillary Clinton at the Rose Law Firm
in Little Rock, Ark., Foster did legal work for the Clintons on the
Whitewater development, a failed land deal that four years ago
triggered Starr's investigation of the president
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry was expanded to include the White House travel
office firings and, earlier this year, the Monica Lewinsky
sex-and-perjury allegations involving the president.
</P>
<P>
   Starr issued a statement saying he was disappointed by
Thursday's ruling but would push forward with his investigations of
the Clinton White House. ``Although we are disappointed in the
outcome of the Supreme Court's decision, we understand and respect
the care and expedition with which the Court resolved the case,''
Starr said.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton called the ruling a victory not only for him and his
late client but for all Americans who consult with an attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day we tell our clients what the law is and instruct
them to obey it; we tell them to settle; we tell them to plead; we
tell them to obey subpoenas; we tell them to tell the truth,''
Hamilton said. ``Without candid information from clients, we can't
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton met with Foster only once and assured him that their
conversation would be confidential.
</P>
<P>
   In his pleadings before the Supreme Court, Starr argued that
Hamilton's notes could provide key information about the travel
office firings and the roles played by various people at the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist said Starr's arguments were not ``frivolous'' but that
he failed to satisfy the court that his need for information was
sufficient to breach the traditional confidentiality rule. The
chief justice said knowing that their discussions will remain
secret even after their death will encourage clients to confide
``fully and frankly'' with their lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist rejected Starr's arguments that disclosure after death
would have a chilling influence only on clients intent on
committing perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, joined by Justices Antonin Scalia
and Clarence Thomas, dissented saying that in criminal cases a
narrow exception should be carved out to the rule that
attorney-client privilege survives a client's death.
</P>
<P>
   If testimony is unavailable from any other source, O'Connor
said, the confidentiality rules would not apply in cases ``where
the exoneration of an innocent criminal defendant or a compelling
law enforcement interest is at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   At Starr's request, the Supreme Court agreed to expedite the
Foster notes case rather than hold it over until the court's new
term, which begins in October.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The court refused a similar effort by Starr to get a speedy
review and decision from the justices on whether Bruce Lindsey,
President Clinton's most trusted legal adviser, and three Secret
Service employees must testify before a federal grand jury in the
Lewinsky matter.

FOLEY MAKES NICE TO JETS' NEWEST QUARTERBACK
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLIFTON, N.J. _ After Glenn Foley learned he had been anointed _
or at least given the ``benefit of the doubt'' in Coach Bill
Parcell's words _ as the Jets' starting quarterback, he made sure
to talk to the newest Jet, Vinny Testaverde.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went over things with Vinny,'' Foley said Thursday. ``You've
got to go out of your way when you're a quarterback to make sure
things are right.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley was given the inside post for the position after Parcells'
dramatic decision to drop Neil O'Donnell and hire Testaverde, the
34-year-old free agent whose performance has actually improved over
the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to some of the fellows on the team,'' Foley said.
``It'll be great playing with Vinny.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley, O'Donnell and Testaverde shared a golf course and locker
room again Thursday in the players' phase of the Cadillac NFL Golf
Classic, which starts Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Neil, what's up?'' Foley asked as O'Donnell passed him in
the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Foley said it was important to spell out the situation between
the Jet quarterbacks. ``I've always gotten along well with
everyone,'' he said. ``That's very important.''
</P>
<P>
   When Foley arrived as the Jets' final draft pick in 1994, he
beat out Jeff Blake as the bench-warming quarterback. Boomer
Esiason was in charge. Then two years later the Jets made their $25
million deal with O'Donnell and Foley was still grounded. Last
season he came into his own only to see his season end with a knee
injury once he had replaced O'Donnell.
</P>
<P>
   So is Foley excited now that he has the starter's role?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always excited, especially now that I'm in the hunt,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Foley reflected on his two serious injuries, the first was a
dislocated shoulder in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just seem to get my head above water,'' he said. ``You
scratch and claw and eventually you'll find land.''
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde knows about scratching and clawing, too. He spent his
first six seasons in Tampa Bay and those years still haunt him in
the public's mind, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been knocked down a lot in my life,'' Testaverde said.
``You have to have the courage to stand back up and come back
swinging.''
</P>
<P>
   It still bothers him, the quarterback admitted, that in radio
interviews his interceptions are brought up. In his career with the
Buccaneers, the Browns and the Ravens, he has been intercepted 183
times while throwing 175 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of that has to do when I was playing with Tampa,'' he
said. ``Look at the numbers from when I was in Tampa and wipe the
slate clean from there and you're going to see much better
numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde has a point. Since leaving Tampa Bay, he has thrown
98 touchdowns to 71 interceptions. He also makes yardage when he
runs and doesn't readily fumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I survived Tampa,'' he said. ``I think I can survive most
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   And O'Donnell on the day after? His agent, Leigh Steinberg, is
exploring possibilities with half a dozen teams. O'Donnell calls
him constantly to find what is going on.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell said he wants to be a starter, but would consider a
backup role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just give me the opportunity,'' he said. ``That's all I'm
asking.''

AS CHINESE SEE IT, TAIWAN REMAINS THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: CHINA-SCENE, CHINA-CLINTON, CHINA-DISSIDENTS,
CHINA-PEONY, CHINA-GINGRICH) 
(JT) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ From China's point of view the most explosive issue
in its relationship with the United States is Taiwan. Chinese
officials consistently argue that the level of American arms sales
to the island violates Washington's pledge to reduce and,
ultimately, phase out such sales.
</P>
<P>
   To press its point, Beijing contends that its help to Pakistan
and Iran's military and missile programs, which Washington is
trying to limit, is comparable to Washington's military assistance
to Taiwan. In negotiations Beijing has suggested trading off its
missile cooperation in the Middle East for American commitments to
cut arms sales sharply to Taiwan, a possibility criticized by
American Republicans like the former American ambassador to China
and representative to Taiwan, James Lilley.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has argued that Chinese missile assistance to
countries like Iran, which may use the weapons offensively, is
quite different from its select supplies of defensive weaponry to
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1979, when Washington recognized Beijing as the sole legal
government of China and acknowledged that Taiwan is part of China,
Washington has been committed to sell Taiwan whatever it needs to
defend itself, language in the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act and passed
by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But in August 1982, in what became known as the third
communique, President Ronald Reagan agreed that the United States
would gradually reduce arms sales to Taipei from the levels of that
era, $830 million a year. For a time the administration cut
spending $20 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Although administration officials, then and now, argue that
nothing in the 1982 communique contradicts the 1979 law, ``the
problem is that the two are not consistent, and it's not hard to
find ways in which they are in conflict,'' said Professor Kenneth
Lieberthal of the University of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The 1979 act, which Congress regards as pre-eminently the law of
the land, speaks of no reductions. The communique, which China
regards as superseding the law, promises reductions of sales to
Taiwan, ``leading over a period of time to a final resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue was not prominent, however, until 1992. Then, in the
midst of his campaign for re-election, President George Bush agreed
to sell Taiwan 150 advanced F-16 fighters, worth more than $5
billion and produced in the pivotal state of Texas. That one sale
drove the fiscal 1992 arms sales to Taiwan of $478 million, to
$6.275 billion for fiscal year 1993, before falling back to figures
below $500 million each year since then, according to unclassified
congressional notifications under the Export Control Act and
assembled by the Congressional Research Service.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years the Clinton administration has also
notified Congress of some major sales, including, in January, three
Knox-class frigates and antisubmarine missiles and launchers worth
$300 million; last year 21 AH-1W Super Cobra attack helicopters
worth $479 million, and, in 1996, two sales of Stinger
ground-to-air missiles and launchers that totaled 1,764 missiles
for $885 million.
</P>
<P>
   China has been particularly concerned about past sales of
Patriot-equivalent air-defense systems and wants to forestall
future American sales of a ``theater missile defense system'' to
Taiwan, a system that has not been developed yet.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1982 communique Beijing promised a peaceful resolution of
the question of Taiwan, which Washington interprets as directly
linked to its promise to reduce arms sales, an assumption that
Beijing rejects. Some officials here have argued that China's
severe reaction to pressure by President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan for
independence, including Chinese missile launchings that bracketed
Taiwan before its elections in March 1996, was also a violation by
Beijing of the communique.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a legal and moral obligation to provide for Taiwan's
security, and if Taiwan feels secure there's more likelihood for a
real cross-straits dialogue between Beijing and Taipei about the
future,'' said Winston Lord, former Assistant Secretary of State
for East Asia and a former ambassador to China.
</P>
<P>
   Even the sales of F-16's, Lord argued, ``though a stretch,''
were nonetheless legitimate, given China's growing military
capacity.

HUMANITARIAN AID PACKAGE OK'D FOR INDIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Thursday, only six weeks after India conducted nuclear tests,
prompting economic sanctions by the United States, the World Bank
resumed its lending program to New Delhi with the endorsement of
the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Washington said the aid, $543 million in loans, is chiefly
humanitarian and thus exempt from its sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's decision suggested that despite Clinton's
warnings about the harm that economic sanctions would do to India
and to Pakistan, which later conducted tests of its own, most World
Bank projects will probably move ahead. The bank focuses most
programs on health, nutrition, education and rural development; it
is unclear whether the administration will seek to block electric
power projects, which are often part of development programs.
</P>
<P>
   The new loan is for Andhra Pradesh, a state that has been a
leader in economic reform. The state has 73 million people, and the
bank said about 30 percent of the children suffer from
malnutrition. The literacy rate is 44 percent, lower than India's
average.
</P>
<P>
   The package the bank approved is directed at those problems,
including projects to insure that more childen complete primary
school, to train health workers and to pay for immunization and
nutrition services for preschool children and pregnant and nursing
women. Money for irrigation systems and the maintenance of rural
roads is also included.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department, which enforces Washington's sanctions,
said all the programs fall under an exception in the 1994 Nuclear
Nonproliferation Act. That law requires Washington to cut off
virtually all direct aid to nations that conduct nuclear tests; it
also bans American banks from making loans to their governments and
mandates that the United States vote against aid to those countries
by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   But the law exempts aid for ``basic human needs,'' a category
that is not defined in the legislation. It is up to the
administration to devise a definition, and it appears to have
chosen a relatively broad one, especially after it became clear
that other industrialized countries would not join in voting
against most World Bank programs for the poor. The United States
has about 18 percent of the voting power in the bank, not enough to
block a program by itself.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's decision signals that the economic pain from the
sanctions will be less than India and Pakistan first feared. India
is the largest borrower from the bank, receiving $1.5 billion this
year, not counting Thursday's program. Pakistan receives less from
the bank, but the aid is a larger portion of its economy.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear what will happen to aid for India's national power
projects. A loan of $450 million, part of a $5.7 billion program
for a power-distribution network, was put on hold a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most severe sanction against both countries,
however, is being meted out by the currency markets.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of the nuclear tests and an unpopular budget
have scared investors away from India, sending its currency
plunging. That has forced leaders of the ruling Bharatiya Janata
Party to draw up new economic reforms, to end state monopolies in
insurance and to make it easier for foreigners to buy real estate,
in the hope of drawing in foreign investment.

MARKET PLACE: PLUG COULD FALL OUT AS SUNBEAM STOCK PLUMMETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   How much worse can it get for Sunbeam Corp?
</P>
<P>
   Since the board of directors dismissed Albert Dunlap as chairman
and chief executive nearly two weeks ago, the stock has continued
to plummet. By all accounts, the financial outlook for the rest of
the year looks bleak.
</P>
<P>
   Suggesting the situation is even more dire, the company said
Thursday that there were unanswered questions about its 1997
financial results and confirmed that the Securities and Exchange
Commission is investigating its accounting practices.
</P>
<P>
   The company, while saying it is conducting an internal review of
its financial statements, reversed its position of just a week
earlier when it said questions about last year's numbers were
without merit.
</P>
<P>
   There is more. Sunbeam said Thursday that it would have to delay
registration of a bond offering with the SEC. The problem: its
independent accounting firm, Arthur Andersen LLP, is withholding
its opinion, needed to complete the filing, until the company
concludes its financial review.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the company said that Arthur Andersen had conducted
a review earlier this month at the request of Sunbeam's board and
had found no problems. Sunbeam and Arthur Andersen declined to
comment on the about-face.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to sorting out any problems with last year's
results, Sunbeam will soon be in violation of loan covenants that
put it at risk of defaulting on $1.4 billion owed to Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter &AMP; Co., Bank of America and First Union.
</P>
<P>
   The lenders require the company to meet certain financial tests,
such as maintaining a cash flow of at least two and a half times
the amount of its interest payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company will not meet these tests as of June 30, 1998,
because of its anticipated loss for the second quarter,'' Sunbeam
said in a statement. The company added that it was negotiating with
the lenders to waive the requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunbeam is seeking the waiver to give its new management time
to complete a full review of Sunbeam's business and develop a new
operating plan,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Sunbeam has drawn down about $1.4 billion of its $1.7 billion
credit line, with Morgan Stanley providing about $680 million of
the total and each of the banks about $510 million.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the lenders could demand immediate repayment of the
loans, but that seems unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The company ``is worth more alive than dead,'' said Joe
Kinnison, a money manager with American Express Financial Advisers,
which holds 3.8 million Sunbeam shares. ``There is no incentive for
the banks to liquidate.''
</P>
<P>
   For investors who wonder if the news can only get better from
here, Kinnison and other stock analysts urge extreme caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a difficult time coming up with a valuation for it at
this time,'' Kinnison said.
</P>
<P>
   A lingering concern is the inventory of barbecue grills and
electric blankets sitting in warehouses, an unknown quantity for
now, Sunbeam concedes.
</P>
<P>
   William Steele, a financial analyst who follows the company for
Buckingham Research Group, said: ``Given the uncertain earnings
outlook, as well as a lack of information regarding the magnitude
of problems the company will face, in conjunction with the
possibility of significant financial restraints placed on the
company based on covenant violations, we would continue to avoid
adding to or initiating positions on Sunbeam.''
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the loss of investor confidence, the company's stock
price has declined sharply from its $52 high in March. The shares
closed at $10.4375 each Thursday, down 13 percent, or $1.5625.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The first hit was in March when Dunlap warned of slowing sales.
A couple of months later, he stunned Wall Street with a $44.6
million first-quarter loss.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, at the same time the board dismissed Dunlap, it said
that his earnings forecasts for the second quarter and full year
were far too high. Sunbeam had been expected to earn 5 cents to 10
cents a share for the quarter ending June 30 and $1 for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The company now says it will report a loss for the quarter and
will not meet the $1 earnings target.
</P>
<P>
   Investor losses, meanwhile, are mounting. Dunlap himself has
suffered a huge paper loss. At the stock's peak, he owned 1.4
million shares worth $77.4 million. Thursday, those shares were
worth $15.5 million. Some of the stock he purchased at market
prices, but most of it was a stock award by the board.
</P>
<P>
   His investment was about $5 million. (The figures exclude
millions of stock options granted by the board that were based on
stock performance and are currently worthless.)
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Sunbeam factory workers and lower-level managers
have fared even worse. They bought shares under a payroll deduction
plan and many have retirement funds invested in the stock. Some of
them, who survived Dunlap's ax, may wonder if the ones who lost
their jobs and took their funds with them were the lucky ones after
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``A large percent of their net worth is probably involved in
their investment, so that is more tragic,'' said Sarah Teslik,
executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Dunlap, whose net worth was more than $100 million even
before arriving at Sunbeam in July 1996, ``they were not investing
just to make money but to protect their homes and families, and
that makes it sadder,'' Ms. Teslik said. &QL;

   Mason, who had been visiting his native Queens during the
National Basketball Association's All-Star Game break, admitted to
having placed sisters age 14 and 15 ``in a position where they
would be subjected to sexual contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Appelbaum, an assistant district attorney, told Queens
Criminal Court Justice Sheryl Parker Thursday that charges of rape
and sexual abuse were being dismissed because the DNA testing did
not link Mason to the victims serologically.

<P>
   Mason was ordered to serve 200 hours of community service
working with the homeless at the Progressive Baptist Church in
Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   William Duggins, Mason's co-defendant and cousin, in whose
apartment the incident occurred, pleaded guilty to statutory rape
and to endangering the welfare of a child. Duggins, 24, of Queens,
was sentenced to five years probation and 800 hours of community
service. &QL;

FUNDING STALEMATE COULD DELAY TEAMSTERS' VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)  (mk) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal monitor who was appointed to supervise the
Teamsters' election said Thursday that, because of a stalemate over
funding, he might have to close his operations and the election
might have to be delayed.
</P>
<P>
   The monitor, Michael Cherkasky, told a U.S. judge that his
office might run out of money within weeks because Congress has
barred using government money to supervise the election, insisting
that the union pay for the election itself.
</P>
<P>
   Cherkasky asked the judge, David Edelstein of U.S. District
Court in Manhattan, to order the government and the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters to work out an agreement to fund his
office so it could oversee the election.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual standoff, Congress has barred federal money from
helping conduct the election, while the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals has ordered the federal government to pay for the election.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court said that a 1989 consent decree states that if
the federal government chooses to supervise the election then it
must pay to conduct and supervise the election. The election is
scheduled for September and October.
</P>
<P>
   Cherkasky said his office needed $8.6 million to conduct the
election, saying that some contractors, like the company that would
print the ballots, were refusing to sign a contract until adequate
funding was guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   The funding dispute, Cherkasky said, could undercut the
longstanding federal effort to root out Teamster corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Cherkasky wrote Edelstein, ``It would be astounding, and a
stunning waste of decades of effort spent fighting organized crime
and labor racketeering, if the current paralysis over funding
resulted in the abandonment of this law enforcement effort and left
the rerun election in limbo.''
</P>
<P>
   In the union's 1996 presidential election, Ron Carey, the
incumbent, narrowly defeated James Hoffa, but federal monitors
threw out the election and ordered a new one because Carey aides
siphoned more than $700,000 of union funds into his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Pazzi, Hoffa's campaign manager, voiced concern Thursday
about the funding stalemate, saying that Hoffa, now the
front-runner, stands to be hurt if the election is delayed.
</P>
<P>
   Cherkasky suggested that even if there was no funding agreement,
Edelstein should order the union to conduct the election, with the
funding to be worked out later.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Peter Hoekstra, R-Mich., the point man in Congress on the
funding issue, criticized Cherkasky for not having set up stricter
controls to stop Teamster officials from using union resources to
support their candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we get some of those issues addressed, it's pretty
difficult to work out the funding issues,'' Hoekstra said in a
telephone interview.

AIDE SAYS HIS TESTIMONY BACKED CLINTON'S DENIALS ON LEWINSKY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sidney Blumenthal, a senior White House aide, said
Thursday that he told a grand jury here that Clinton's private
comments to him about Monica Lewinsky did not contradict his public
denials of a sexual relationship with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they really liked the story that I had to
tell,'' Blumenthal said of the prosecutors investigating the
president, describing in an interview Thursday night his appearance
before the grand jury Thursday and one on June 4.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, Clinton tried to exert executive privilege to prevent
Blumenthal's testimony. The president dropped his claim after a
federal judge rejected it.
</P>
<P>
   But Blumenthal said Thursday night that his testimony supported
Clinton's denials. ``What I told the grand jury, under oath,
supports completely what the president has told the American
people, and is contrary to any charge that the president has done
anything wrong,'' Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said that prosecutors told him he was done for now,
but that he might eventually be called back. Tuesday, prosecutors
plan to call Linda Tripp, the Pentagon worker whose surreptitious
taping of Ms. Lewinsky and contacts with the office of Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr helped entangle Clinton in charges of perjury
and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from Blumenthal's account, prosecutors are looking into
whether the White House has tried to obstruct the investigation
since the charges were disclosed in January.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said that many questions centered on the twice-daily
strategy sessions that some senior White House aides and lawyers
have held for the last five months.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were on to a new fantasy plot of obstruction,'' scoffed
Blumenthal, who is a communications adviser to the president. ``In
the new fantasy plot, the obstruction was taking place in White
House strategy meetings, and we were receiving orders and carrying
them out.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr spokesman Charles Bakaly declined to comment on
Blumenthal's description of his testimony, saying that while
witnesses were free under grand jury rules to discuss their
testimony, ``the prosecutors cannot do so, even to respond to
inaccurate statements.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Starr has indicated that exploring discussions among White House
aides was important to determining whether there has been
obstruction. In oral arguments opposing the White House claim of
executive privilege, Starr said, ``If there is no evidence of White
House involvement in obstruction of justice, or if there is, it is
not going to be on paper and it's not going to be on tapes. It will
be conversations, talk between human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   William Alden McDaniel, Blumenthal's lawyer, said that
Blumenthal declined to answer one question Thursday on what he
called ``a minor topic,'' which he did not describe. He said that
Blumenthal ``would be happy to answer if he is so instructed by the
judge.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said that he was asked whether President Clinton or
Mrs. Clinton issued orders to participants at the strategy
meetings, and answered no. He said that he told the jurors that
during the meetings, ``We talk about what's in the media, and we
talk about politics and tactics and strategy.'' The Clintons do not
attend the meetings, aides have said.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said that he was also asked who was permitted to
speak in the strategy meetings, and replied that anyone could.
``They said to me, `You mean to tell us that Mike McCurry just
doesn't follow orders, he's allowed to speak in meetings?''' said
Blumenthal, in a reference to the White House press secretary. ``I
said, `Yes, he's allowed to speak, and he has a lot of opinions.'''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal, who has framed his subpoena to testify on his office
wall, has made no secret of his contempt for Starr and some of his
team. He said he had run up about $50,000 in legal fees because of
the Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said that he was asked both Thursday and three weeks
ago about a private talk he had had with the president in the Oval
Office early in the evening of Jan. 21, as the accusations
involving Ms. Lewinsky erupted. Blumenthal said that he described
the conversation to the grand jury, but he declined to describe it
publicly. ``I still regard this as a confidence from the
president,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said that the jurors themselves asked a few
questions. He said that their questions were ``more personal,''
saying that one asked, ``Why did the president confide in you?''

COURT'S RULING ON INDECENCY PROMPTS FEARS OF A CHILLING EFFECT

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Performance artists whose lawsuit led to Thursday's
Supreme Court decision on indecency in the arts expressed
disappointment at the ruling, saying they feared it would have a
chilling effect on creativity and freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
   For Karen Finley, whose performance in a New York theater as a
chocolate-covered nude was at the heart of the case, the decision
was a personal defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm stunned and saddened by it,'' she said. She had listened
to the oral arguments made before the Supreme Court and thought
that the court would rule in her favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your child falls down a well: what's your reaction?'' she
said. ``I spent years on the case, and I lose. It's a major
tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Endowment for the Arts, which gives money to
encourage development of the arts, rescinded grants awarded to Ms.
Finley and three other performance artists _ Tim Miller, Holly
Hughes and John Fleck _ after protests from members of Congress,
led by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C. The artists filed a lawsuit, which
ultimately led to the Supreme Court case.
</P>
<P>
   The court, in an 8-1 ruling, upheld a 1990 law requiring the NEA
to consider decency standards when deciding which artists should
get grant money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take it that the Supreme Court has decided that my work is
indecent,'' Ms. Finley said. Alluding to the title of one of her
first shows, ``We Keep Our Victims Ready,'' she said, ``No matter
what you do you're still a victim. I think it's very sexist.''
</P>
<P>
   In her performance, Ms. Finley uses her body, sometimes
appearing nude and covered only with chocolate, to make a statement
about the abuse of women. ``My work was taken out of context and
eroticized by Helms on the Senate floor,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Finley said that the impact of the decision will be felt in
other areas of the arts and predicted that museums and foundations
will be more reluctant to offer support to artists with unpopular
views.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is going to be the decider of what's decent and what
isn't?'' she said. ``It will be a free-for-all. The witch hunt can
happen anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Finley is appearing Off Off Broadway at the Flea Theater in
``The Return of the Chocolate-Smeared Woman.'' She said she would
continue her performances, but she might look for alternatives to
performing, although she feels she may have to confront repression
even as an author and visual artist.
</P>
<P>
   For Miller, the court decision is ``a further nail in the coffin
of freedom of ideas and images in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a chilling effect,'' Miller said, adding that the
decision will not only affect established performers like himself
and Ms. Finley, but also limit opportunities for emerging artists.
He was concerned about the effect of the decision on such
institutions as the National Science Foundation, the National
Endowment for the Humanities, the Smithsonian Institution and the
academic world itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you express an unpopular opinion, it would seem to be a
pretty serious breach,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Miller said he views the case as an ``ongoing battle,'' and
prefers to take a long view: ``One hundred years from now, the
decision will seem as absurd as the Dred Scott decision.'' &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: YANKS ENTER SCRAPBOOKS OF HISTORY  
 (JT )
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NANTES, France _ Say goodbye to the 1998 American World Cup
team. It was to soccer what American cheese is to food _ bland,
formless and ultimately harmless.
</P>
<P>
   They disappeared into history Thursday night with a 1-0 loss to
Yugoslavia, which is no shame, considering that Yugoslavia has the
firepower of a semifinalist team. However, the Americans had
already identified themselves as mushy in previous losses to
Germany and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The team will always be remembered as having very little in
common with the American team that qualified from a grueling
two-year tournament in the Americas. That team was dismantled by
the coach, Steve Sampson, in recent weeks, starting with the
still-unexplained sacking of John Harkes, the doughty captain.
</P>
<P>
   Sampson's reward for such last-minute tinkering will surely be
his freedom to seek new challenges in the wonderful world of work.
The officials of the United States Soccer Federation called a press
conference in the wee small hours of Thursday morning to insist
that Sampson has indeed not been dismissed, but that a decision
will be made within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Sampson's departure will come too late for the cadre of veterans
who held the team together for much of this decade, but were
discarded in recent months. As the team went to a rural retreat in
Beaujolais country, the players began whining about being isolated,
far from the bright lights of downtown Lyon.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Alexi Lalas made several grumpy remarks about
the demise of the team. To combat the mutterings, Alan Rothenberg,
the president of the federation, addressed the players Wednesday.
He said there was no threat involved: ``I just told them to think
about what you say. Don't say anything you might regret.''
</P>
<P>
   Since this tournament is being held in the land of liberte,
fraternite, egalite, a few of the lads felt they had the freedom to
say a few words after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll all get older, and we'll all have scrapbooks,'' said
Lalas, normally flippant but apparently furious. ``I'm satisfied
with myself, even though I didn't play a minute here. I'll be
satisfied with my scrapbook. Steve has to be satisfied with his
scrapbook.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampson may not want to put into his scrapbook the epitaph from
Tab Ramos, the crabby little midfielder who was a star in the 1990
and 1994 World Cups but only a bit player here.
</P>
<P>
   ``For one reason or another, this whole thing was a shambles,''
said Ramos, who noted that 17 different players saw action in the
first two games, and ``everybody felt he should play.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those was Eric Wynalda, the all-time leading scorer, who
was brought in late Thursday night, and was not a factor.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is hard for strikers to function in Sampson's
3-6-1- formation, which leaves one lonely forward as isolated as
the frontier scout played by Kevin Costner in the movie ``Dances
With Wolves.''
</P>
<P>
   Wynalda said he thought Sampson's decisions were ``personal,''
not necessarily connected to soccer, but he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Once the players had trudged off into history, Rothenberg and
his associates talked up the future of U.S. soccer. Sunil Gulati,
the vice president of the federation, who deals with the players,
noted that the United States used to have a pool of 20 players but
now has 100 good players available, and that war horses like
Marcelo Balboa, Lalas and Ramos might never come along again
because competition would limit players to shorter terms.
Rothenberg noted that the United States had achieved a second-round
loss to Brazil in 1994, and he insisted this year's three-and-out
performance was in some ways an improvement. He must have been
watching Nigeria or Mexico. The U.S. team basically could not pass
or shoot. To their credit, however, the lads did qualify for
France, which allowed hundreds of Americans to wander around this
lovely Loire Estuary town, happily eating crustaceans and wearing
their Sam's Army T-shirts, soon to be collectors' items.
</P>
<P>
   But Americans are notorious front-runners, as proven by the
American federation's return of 1,000 tickets that were unsold once
the United States was skunked by Iran, 2-1, last Sunday in Lyon.
</P>
<P>
   Now some of the lads take a brief vacation before their European
clubs start again, while others will be playing for their Major
League Soccer teams as soon as Saturday night. The federation goes
looking for a coach. Carlos Queiroz, the experienced Portuguese
coach, has committed to coach the United Arab Emirates. Carlos
Alberto Parreira, who won the 1994 World Cup with Brazil, has just
been dismissed by Saudi Arabia. Rothenberg leaves office on Aug.
23, but promises a coaching decision by then.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, there are more crustaceans in Nantes, and 16
good soccer teams starting Saturday. Oddly enough, without the
Yanks, the world keeps spinning.

JUSTICES UPHOLD DECENCY LAW FOR ARTS GRANTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court ruled Thursday the constitutional
right to free speech and expression does not automatically prevent
the federal government from limiting its arts funding to works that
meet general decency standards.
</P>
<P>
   A controversial 1990 federal law requires the chairman of the
National Endowment for the Arts to consider ``general standards of
decency and respect for the diverse beliefs and values of the
American public'' before awarding government grants.
</P>
<P>
   In an 8-1 decision, the high court upheld that standard for
allocating federal resources for artists, many of whom rely on such
support for their work.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court said the law _ as written _ neither prevents
artists from speaking nor does it necessarily require NEA to
discriminate against a work of art because of the opinion it
expresses.
</P>
<P>
   However, the court said the NEA could run afoul of the First
Amendment if it applies the standards in a way that discriminates
based on viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``That the statutory standard admonishes the NEA merely to take
`decency and respect' into consideration, and that the legislation
was aimed at reforming procedures rather than precluding speech,
undercut argument that the provision inevitably will be utilized as
a tool for invidious viewpoint discrimination,'' Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor wrote for the majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the NEA were to leverage its power to award subsidies on
the basis of subjective criteria into a penalty on disfavored
viewpoints, then we would confront a different case.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice David H. Souter, the sole dissenter, assailed the court
for failing to see the ``clear legislative purpose, so plainly
expressed'' that Congress, through the NEA, intended to suppress
artistic expression that lawmakers find offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``A statute disfavoring speech that fails to respect America's
`diverse beliefs and values' is the very model of viewpoint
discrimination; it penalizes any view disrespectful to any belief
or value espoused by someone in the American populace,'' Souter
wrote. ``Boiled down to its practical essence, the limitation
obviously means that art that disrespects the ideology, opinions or
convictions of a significant segment of the American public is to
be disfavored ...''
</P>
<P>
   Four performance artists, who believe their scatological work
might not pass NEA muster, challenged the agency's standard as a
violation of the First Amendment's right to speak and express
oneself without governmental interference.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Finley, John Fleck, Holly Hughes and Tim Miller sued the
government, seeking a judicial ruling that the standard is
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   They won in the U.S. District Court for Central California and
again in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals before losing in the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   In its decision, the high court rejected the artists' argument
that the NEA standards are unconstitutionally vague, giving
government officials free reign to determine what the standards
mean.
</P>
<P>
   The justices likened the standards to valid, equally subjective
evaluations the government uses in awarding scholarships based on
``excellence'' and similarly ill-defined criteria. ``To accept the
vagueness argument would be to call into question the
constitutionality of these valuable government programs and
countless others like them,'' O'Connor wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Stephen G.
Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Anthony M. Kennedy and John Paul
Stevens joined O'Connor's opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia, writing separately, not only agreed
NEA's standards pass constitutional muster but added that the
Constitution allows the federal government to consider the opinions
expressed in deciding whether to fund an artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who wish to create indecent and disrespectful art are as
unconstrained now as they were before the enactment of this
statute,'' Scalia wrote in an opinion joined by Justice Clarence
Thomas. ``They are merely deprived of the additional satisfaction
of having the bourgeoisie taxed to pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The socially conservative Family Research Council hailed the
court's decision as sending a ``strong message'' to artists whose
work shows disdain for religious symbols or celebrates homosexual
love.
</P>
<P>
   ``If government's in the art business, it has every right to
call the tune,'' said Robert Knight, the council's cultural
director. ``No individual has a right to be granted tax dollars
with no strings attached.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the liberal civil rights group People for the American
Way called the court's decision ``troubling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Allowing the government to attach strings and apply vague
criteria to its funding will cast a chill over First Amendment
rights by encouraging the institutions that rely on government
funding to shy away from controversial topics or viewpoints,''said
Elliot Mincberg the group's legal director.

SUSAN MCDOUGAL FREED FROM PRISON BY FEDERAL JUDGE IN LITTLE ROCK 
</HEADLINE>
  (ps) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Susan McDougal, the embattled Whitewater figure who
suffered incarceration rather than answer grand jury questions
about Bill and Hillary Clinton, was unexpectedly ordered freed from
prison by a federal judge in Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives wept as Mrs. McDougal offered a dazed smile at the
sudden decision by U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr., taken
after she insisted that her previous 21 months of imprisonment had
severely aggravated a spinal condition. The judge, saying he was
motivated by ``compassion and mercy,'' reduced her sentence to time
served.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still so stunned,'' Mrs. McDougal said when she finally
emerged to freedom outside the courthouse, 90 minutes after the
decision. ``I just don't know what to say,'' she exulted, still in
her two-piece bright orange prison uniform, looking physically wan,
but ebullient in spirit. ``I still don't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling eliminated the remainder of a two-year prison
sentence she began serving in March for her conviction in the first
Whitewater trial on charges of mail fraud, misapplication of funds
and making false statements. Taking into account the 18 months of
separate jail time she had served for resisting the grand jury
investigation of the Clintons, the judge ruled that she be freed
from the fraud conviction.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge also ordered that in 10 days, she must begin a
90-day period of home detention at her parents' house in Camden,
Ark., under electronic monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a much better person today than the one you sentenced,''
Mrs. McDougal told the judge. ``I promise you, you won't be
sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Her troubles with the courts and Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater
independent counsel, were hardly ended by the ruling, for Mrs.
McDougal was re-indicted by Starr last month for once more refusing
to answer grand jury questions about the Clintons and Whitewater.
That trial, on charges of criminal contempt and obstruction of
justice, is set for Sept. 28 in Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Mrs. McDougal faces an unrelated criminal trial on
July 13 in California on charges that she embezzled $150,000 from
the music conductor Zubin Mehta when she worked as his bookkeeper
from 1989 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDougal was not immediately freed after the decision as
federal marshals indicated they had to sort out her bail status in
the face of the charges still pending. Her mother, Laura Henley,
indicated that Mrs. McDougal might spend the night in a Little Rock
hotel but was soon expected home under the judge's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to take her home so bad,'' Mrs. Henley said, beaming
and teary-eyed outside the Little Rock courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Throeeh her travail, Mrs. McDougal has maintained a combative
resistance to Starr and his attempts to link the Clintons to
criminal activity in the decade-old complex of real estate and
political events known as Whitewater. She stood firm in leg irons
and high heels as she was led off the first time for her silence
and her supporters opened an Internet web site (www.stopstarr.org)
that portrayed her as a martyr to prosecutorial zeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Resign and I'll answer all their questions,'' she said
defiantly to prosecutors in her second contempt struggle with
Starr, insisting he had numerous conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Howard issued his decision after hearing testimony from Dr.
Ronald Fisk, a clinical neurologist at the University of California
at Los Angeles that Mrs. McDougal was suffering seriously
progressive curvature of the spine and related disk problems that
may require surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's spokesman, Charles Bakaly, noted that criminal contempt
charges were still pending against Mrs. McDougal. ``The judge made
a compassioned decision based on medical testimony to release Mrs.
McDougal, and we respect the judge's decision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDougal has repeatedly rebuffed the independent counsel
team, accusing Starr of bias in his investigation of President
Clinton's affairs during his gubernatorial years in Arkansas. In
her re-indictment last month, prosecutors charged that after Mrs.
McDougal was granted immunity and compelled to testify by a federal
judge, she failed to answer questions posed by prosecutors and
grand jurors, contending that the prosecutors were prejudiced.
</P>
<P>
   The questions covered whether Clinton had testified truthfully
at Ms. McDougal's criminal trial, the nature of Mrs. Clinton's
legal work on behalf of a corrupt Arkansas savings association
owned by Mrs. McDougal's former husband, and the Clintons'
knowledge of an improperly financed land deal that was supposed to
bail out the Whitewater Development Company in which they had
invested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to answer the grand jury's questions,'' Mrs.
McDougal declared, according to her jury testimony denouncing the
prosecutors. ``But they don't have anyone in here that will take
this investigation where it should go.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors maintain she had no legal basis for refusing to
answer questions central to the investigation. They sought to
cross-examine her about the version of Whitewater events and
denials offered by Clinton in his videotaped deposition at her
trial. Nor would she say whether she had a discussion with Clinton
about an improper loan issued in 1986 by David Hale, a former
municipal judge who ran an investment company backed by the Small
Business administration.
</P>
<P>
   Hale has testified that Clinton, when he was governor of
Arkansas, asked him to issue an unlawful $300,000 loan that paid
for some Whitewater expenses. Clinton has denied under oath that he
knew about the loan or played any role in obtaining it.
</P>
<P>
   Laced through Mrs. McDougal's struggle with Starr has been the
parallel, at times conflicting version of events left by her former
husband, Jim McDougal, who died earlier this year, who also was
convicted on Whitewater charges. Criticized as a colorful
prevaricator, McDougal made charges, denied by the president, that
Mrs. McDougal was once Clinton's lover and that the president had
privately agreed to grant her a pardon if she were convicted.
</P>
<P>
   After her release, Mark Barrett, an associate independent
counsel, emphasized that the government had offered no opposition
to Mrs. McDougal's motion to be allowed her freedom on her own
recognizance, pending her next contempt trial.
</P>
<P>
   With all her remaining legal problems, Mrs. McDougal was in high
spirits on the Little Rock sidewalk as she tasted her first freedom
since September 1996. Her attorney, Mark Geragos, said, ``Without a
doubt it was more than I expected.'' He escorted her away to ``get
her some clothes'' other than a prison uniform.

<P>
   LONDON _ President Bill Clinton has been invited to Tiananmen
Square by China's leaders during his Beijing visit this week. He
must accept. I can tell him exactly where to stand.
</P>
<P>
   It is a cluster of paving stones not far from the ``Golden
Water'' bridges leading to the Forbidden City and a huge portrait
of Mao, which hangs over the gate into the imperial palaces.
</P>
<P>
   On those stones, in the middle of the night of June 3-4, 1989, I
watched an armored personnel carrier pursue an unarmed
demonstrator, run him down and squash him, leaving his blood
glistening under the street lamps.
</P>
<P>
   Next to me about three minutes later a Chinese man wearing a
T-shirt suddenly slumped over the bridge railing, shot dead by the
soldiers of the 38th Army advancing across the square along the
Forbidden City's vermilion walls.
</P>
<P>
   A few hundred yards away, the next morning, I watched the army
mow down dozens of people trying to enter the square to find their
dead relatives.
</P>
<P>
   When he stands on those paving stones, with the press around
him, Clinton should speak of the longing for liberty of Asia's
peoples. When it is frustrated, he should say, these longings lead
to scenes like the recent ones in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   Those scenes were carefully edited for Chinese television so
that the Indonesian students barely appeared. This permitted the
official Chinese commentator to bewail what was happening in the
capital of the world's fourth most populous country as ``chaos''
and ``instability,'' two of the four key words still used today in
Beijing to describe the events of early June nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Another phrase still used today, although it has been recently
removed from the criminal code, is ``counterrevolutionary
uprising,'' the charge employed to arrest and imprison tens of
thousands of Chinese all over the country after the June 4
killings.
</P>
<P>
   The official word used to describe what happened in Tiananmen
Square and its aftermath is ``incident.'' The Chinese leadership
insists on this euphemism because it minimizes what remains the
greatest unresolved political problem in China.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's host, President Jiang Zemin, has referred to the
West's interest in Tiananmen as ``much ado about nothing.'' This is
also the view of Hong Kong's Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa, whose
verdict on June 4, 1989, is that ``It happened _ leave it to
history.''
</P>
<P>
   Doubtless there are advisers in Clinton's entourage who assure
him that young people in China are ``interested only in making
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Deng Xiaoping certainly did not think that the 1989 killings
were a mere incident or much ado about nothing.
</P>
<P>
   He told Lee Tsung-dao of Columbia University, a Nobel laureate
in physics, and former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau that
Tiananmen was far more dangerous than the Cultural Revolution, and
that the ``so-called democratic fighters'' could have broken China
apart. Fortunately for China, Deng said ``I was still around.''
</P>
<P>
   He was indeed, and in the ensuing qingcha, or ferreting out, 4
million Communist Party members, out of a total of more than 40
million, plus high and low government officials, intellectuals,
bureaucrats, scientists and journalists were investigated.
Thousands were arrested, tortured and executed. No one knows how
many are still detained.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International records more than 250 post-Tiananmen
prisoners, but in its latest report observes that ``the real number
is much higher.''
</P>
<P>
   I saw three of Amnesty's ``names'' commit the crime for which
they remain behind bars. They hurled little pots of paint at the
Mao portrait in Tiananmen, and the thin blue, green and yellow
streams ran down the gigantic cheeks and over the huge wart.
</P>
<P>
   For this they received, respectively, 16 years, 20 years and
life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   All were tortured, according to reports from Hunan, where they
are detained, and one went mad. The portrait was replaced within an
hour by an identical hand-painted spare, perhaps the one Clinton
will see.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton likes to say to those who suffer, ``I feel your pain.''
He should ask for an interview with Professor Ding Zilin. She is
the mother of a college student shot dead in Tiananmen.
</P>
<P>
   Despite constant police harassment, she has collected two dozen
other mothers whose children were killed and who periodically
petition the government (they have just done so again ) to
investigate what happened on the night of June 3-4, who gave the
orders to shoot, and on what grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose that in Beijing alone some thousands were killed or
wounded. How many friends and relatives did those Beijing people,
from every walk of life, have? And how many more across China were
related to the vast throng of those caught in the ``ferreting
out''?
</P>
<P>
   What people want to know, says the historian Dai Qing, who has
been imprisoned herself but continues to delve into the dark past
of the Chinese Communist regime, is: ``How did we end up in this
mess? Where did we go wrong?''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton should use his Tiananmen exposure to answer
some of these disturbing questions. Despite China's experienced
censors, he will have the biggest audience of his life. &QL;

<P>
   BANGKOK _ Available now from a telephone near you: cut-rate
international calls via the Internet, no computer required.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently only computer hobbyists could cajole their
computers into acting like telephones. Now, thanks to rapid
advances in technology, Internet telephone calls can be made by
anyone with a standard touch-tone phone.
</P>
<P>
   The explosive growth of the phenomenon is attracting major
telecommunications companies, thousands of subscribers and a
handful of pirates who sail along the fringes of the law.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Internet developments, these telephone services made
their debut in the United States, where they offer transcontinental
calls for a few cents per minute, a fraction of the standard rate.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, however, Internet phone companies have sprung
up on almost every continent, making rapid inroads into established
markets despite their lower quality.
</P>
<P>
   Internet-based calls frequently have annoying echoes, long
delays and reduced voice clarity compared to regular connections.
But for many consumers, the tremendous cost savings _ often more
than 50 percent _ outweigh the inconvenience. And the technology is
rapidly improving.
</P>
<P>
   Internet phone calls cross international borders in a form
identical to normal Internet data.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, Internet phone service works the same way as
standard international calling cards: Subscribers use any
touch-tone telephone to dial a local access number, followed by an
identity code and the number they wish to reach.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, at the local access number, the call is
bounced off the traditional phone network and into the Internet by
a so-called gateway computer. In the destination city, the call is
brought back out of the Internet and onto the standard phone
network by the operator's corresponding gateway.
</P>
<P>
   For voice to travel via Internet, the gateway computers
translate standard analog telephone signals into digital bits, much
like music on a compact disk.
</P>
<P>
   So by traveling most of the distance as data in the Internet,
international calls can effectively be made for the price of two
local phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   But cheap calls are just one advantage of using the Internet for
telephone calls, according to industry advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology used in standard telephone systems was
developed 40 years ago and is based on old concepts,'' said Jeff
Pulver, president of Pulver.com, an Internet telephone consultancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet's efficient digital platform opens the way for many
value-added services, like cheap conference calls,
videoconferencing and people sharing documents while talking,''
Pulver said.
</P>
<P>
   The digital method of transmission will eventually allow an
Internet phone to leapfrog the traditional telephone in quality,
according to those in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet phone calls use the most advanced all-digital
equipment, so it is like listening to music on a compact disc,''
said Darryl Green, president and chief executive officer of the
AT&AMP;T Jens Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, ``we have already improved our technology
enough so that with blind tests, people can no longer tell the
difference between an Internet call and a regular call.''
</P>
<P>
   To create an Internet telephone company, operators simply set up
gateway computers in separate cities to bring calls on and off the
Internet. An off-the-shelf personal computer can readily serve as a
gateway, but quality improves dramatically with specialized
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the low overhead, countries with high-cost overseas
calls and recently deregulated telecommunications industries have
experienced dramatic shifts of consumers who are moving into
Internet-based phone services.
</P>
<P>
   In 10 months, an Internet telephone service in Japan offered by
the AT&AMP;T joint venture Jens claims to have grabbed 1 percent of the
country's $4.5 billion outgoing international call market on an
investment of less than $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Deregulated markets will help Internet phone operators swallow
36 percent of the international call market within five years,
threatening the core revenue and profits of traditional telephone
operators, according to a report released this month by the
Cambridge-based consultancy Analysys.
</P>
<P>
   The unregulated days of Internet telephones may, however, be
numbered. The United States government is now considering a levy on
Internet phone operators similar to that paid by traditional
long-distance carriers.
</P>
<P>
   But even in heavily regulated countries, where international
calls are controlled by state-sanctioned monopolies, Internet
telephone calling is making its debut.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Singapore Telecom, which holds the monopoly on
outgoing international calls until the year 2000, began testing its
BudgetCall service which routes calls via the Internet to 18
countries and undercuts the company's regular international call
rate by 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that it is technically illegal to sell
international calls from many countries, independent operators are
already using technology to circumvent the law.
</P>
<P>
   Two companies recently founded in Singapore _ RVNet and Global
Voice _ are building clandestine networks linking the tightly
regulated telecommunications networks of Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The legal status of Internet phone is very gray in most Asian
countries, so for the time being, the company avoids advertising
very much in local papers, said James Cai, who is the managing
director of Global Voice.
</P>
<P>
   Cai claims that 2,000 subscribers have signed on in the two
months since the service was launched in Singapore. ``But for us,
outside of Singapore, we don't worry about local laws. We leave
that to franchise holders who join our network.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Ngor, general manager of RVNet, said: ``It may not be
fully legal, but the telecom companies are unable to stop the calls
going through the Internet, and we will eat into their
international dialing revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Cai plans to build the Global Voice network by selling his
gateways as franchises to target various ethnic groups around Asia,
especially Japanese living overseas.
</P>
<P>
   For about $10,000, franchise holders buy a personal computer
configured to work as a Global Voice network gateway. Once plugged
in, calls can be made through the Internet to any city with a
fellow franchise holder.
</P>
<P>
   Global Voice ensures that calls go to the right gateways,
monitors the pattern of calls and settles billing differences
between franchise holders if calls are made more in one direction
than another.
</P>
<P>
   To start with, Global Voice recommends that franchise holders
undercut the standard international rates by 50 percent. ``When
more Internet phone services are offered, we will have to lower the
price again,'' Cai said.
</P>
<P>
   Internet telephone technology is advancing so quickly that even
today's model of phone service provider could change dramatically
within the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   While Global Voice and RVNet are building their networks around
self-developed technology, U.S. modem giant 3Com Corp. will soon
begin selling an upgrade to their popular servers that allows any
Internet provider to become a phone company.
</P>
<P>
   ``For just a few hundred dollars' upgrade, any Internet service
provider that uses our servers will be able to send telephone calls
over the Internet,'' said Ken Jensen, account development manager
at 3Com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we have a 40 percent market share among Internet service
providers and our equipment is being used in almost every country,
all an Internet provider needs to do is agree how they will sell
the phone calls between one another, and they can be an
international phone company,'' he said. &QL;

HOUSE SPENDING BILL DICTATES DELAY IN ACTION ON CLIMATE TREATY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional opponents of a treaty to fight the
threat of global warming are using the annual spending bills now
before Congress to send a blunt message to the Clinton
administration: Don't even think about how to meet the treaty's
goals before it wins Senate approval.
</P>
<P>
   As a House committee drafted a bill Thursday that finance the
Environmental Protection Agency, the treaty's foes won language
warning that the money was not to be used ``for the purpose of
implementation, or in contemplation of implementation, of the Kyoto
Protocol.''
</P>
<P>
   The international pact, negotiated in Japan last year and
supported by the administration, is opposed by industries including
oil, coal, automobile and public utilities, and faces an uphill
fight in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty's opponents in the House want to bar the EPA from
even holding seminars on the need to cut emissions of heat-trapping
greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials warned that the EPA spending bill might
be vetoed, because of differences with Congress over climate
policies, along with other objections to bill, which also finances
housing programs, veterans' programs and others.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill ``could threaten to block administration efforts
to encourage activities like energy efficiency and renewable energy
that are clearly good for the country,'' said Todd Stern. President
Clinton's climate-change policy coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``It amounts to a gag order that seeks to prevent the
administration from educating and informing the public,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The House Appropriations Committee fended off attempts Thursday
by Democrats to modify the disputed language. But the legislation
still faces consideration by the full House and Senate. The
disputed provisions were inserted by a subcommittee last week at
the urging of Rep. Joe Knollenberg, a Republican from the suburbs
of Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Treaty opponents have seized every opportunity to challenge the
administration. Rep. John D. Dingell, D-Mich., recently objected
when the EPA paid for a study on limiting greenhouse gases through
a system of trading emissions credits. The study, he complained in
a letter to EPA Administrator Carol Browner, assumed that the Kyoto
protocol would be ratified.
</P>
<P>
   The Kyoto treaty calls for industrial nations to reduce
emissions of greenhouse gases, with the United States cutting 1990
levels by 7 percent over the next ten or fifteen years. Last year,
United States emissions of carbon dioxide were about 10 percent
higher than in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty is strongly opposed by the automobile industry and
coal producers, among other industries. The administration, faced
with powerful opposition, has said it will not ask the Senate to
approve the deal until further negotiations establish rules for
participation by developing nations and for trading
emissions-reduction credits among nations.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the administration's opponents in Congress have cut
spending requests for existing programs, like energy conservation.
The House spending bill would cut the EPA's request for
climate-related programs by $106 million.
</P>
<P>
   The committee report accompanying the House bill said that the
bill is intended to prohibit implementation of the protocol ``in
any manner'' before it is approved by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation prohibits any spending ``to develop, propose, or
issue rules, regulations, decrees, or orders for the purpose of
implementation, or in contemplation of implementation, of the Kyoto
Protocol.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that might prevent them from
setting energy-efficiency standards, encouraging industries to take
such measures, or finding ways to give credit to companies that
reduce emissions before the treaty becomes binding.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's report ordered the EPA and the White House
Council on Environmental Quality ``to refrain from conducting
educational outreach or informational seminars on policies
underlying the Kyoto Protocol until, or unless, the Protocol is
ratified by the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   The agencies, the report said, ``may be engaging in activity
that is tantamount to lobbying in an effort to build public support
for implementation of the Protocol.'' The language in the reports
is usually not binding but carries weight with agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., urged the White House ``to
disregard such directives unless they have been voted by the
Congress.''

U.S. MUST ALTER BEHAVIOR, IRANIAN OFFICIAL SAYS
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By ELAINE SCIOLINO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ Iran on Thursday reiterated its rejection of a
political dialogue with the United States, as a deputy foreign
minister praised the Clinton administration for softening its
hostile tone but sharply criticized Washington for not abandoning
its punitive policies against his country.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, the minister, Mohammed Javad Zarif, offered the
most detailed official Iranian reaction to a speech last week by
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright calling on the Iranian
government to help formulate a ``road map'' to normal relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see a move at least in rhetoric on the part of the United
States to better understand the realities of the Islamic Republic
as well as of our region,'' Zarif said. But, he added, ``Where it
matters, where it will be taken seriously by Iran _ regarding the
policies of the United States, the behavior of the United States _
we see the remnants of a Cold War mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other issues, Zarif cited the continuation of an American
trade embargo against Iran and American opposition to the building
of a pipeline through Iran to transport oil from the Caspian Sea as
proof of American ill will toward his country.
</P>
<P>
   Zarif, who studied at Columbia University and San Francisco
State University and holds a Ph.D. in international relations from
the University of Denver, served as a diplomat at the United
Nations for nine years, and is known for his conciliatory tone,
even when it comes to discussing the Ujited States.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks amplified those made by Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi in Spain last week in which he said that if the United
States is serious in improving relations with Iran, it must prove
it with ``facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither President Mohammed Khatami nor Iran's spiritual leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has reacted publicly to Albright's speech,
which was the result of long deliberations within the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed Ali Nateq Noori, the speaker of the Parliament who was
defeated by Khatami in last year's presidential election, did not
refer to Albright's remarks in a speech on Tuesday, but said, ``It
is a mistake to imagine that America has given up mischief.''
</P>
<P>
   Iran is embroiled in a high-stakes political battle between
supporters of Khatami, who has pushed for the creation of a civil
society and the rule of law, and conservative supporters of
Khamenei, who are determined to uphold revolutionary values.
Improving relations with the United States is not high on the
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Zarif also faulted Albright for repeating
charges against Iran that it sponsors terrorism and is developing a
dangerous program of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and
ballistic missiles. ``She made a big mistake, big mistake,'' Zarif
said.
</P>
<P>
   On the American call for an official dialogue between the two
countries, Zarif said, ``We don't believe that the behavior of the
United States shows yet that it is ready for a dialogue based on
mutual respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, some Iranian officials have expressed concern that
even if they proceed down the road with negotiations with the
United States, they could end up empty-handed. Three years ago,
Rafsanjani, as president, said that the United States had missed a
signal to improve relations with Iran when it forced the
cancellation of a $1 billion deal that Iran had made with an
American oil company.
</P>
<P>
   Zarif acknowledged that even Iran's modest opening of the
country to American scholars and political analysts had been
criticized in news reports and in Parliament. ``To put it mildly,
there is a diversity of views regarding that exchange,'' he said.

<P>
   Iran has rejected requests for visas by a number of American
lawmakers and at least one former hostage who applied for a tourist
visa, Iranian officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's remarks have reignited a debate in Iran's
increasingly outspoken news outlets over policy toward the United
States, with some newspapers voicing suspicion of the United
States, while others have suggested that improved relations with
Washington are possible.
</P>
<P>
   One sign that the mood in Tehran toward the United States is
less uniformly hostile than it has been in the past came after Iran
beat the United States in a World Cup soccer match last Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   In Vali Assr Square in central Tehran a group of men raised an
American flag and showered onlookers with leaflets denouncing the
United States. As soon as the group began to set the flag on fire,
it was pulled down into the crowd. Other onlookers tore up the
leaflets.

DIVIDED COURT RULES DISABILITIES ACT COVERS HIV-INFECTED PEOPLE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A sharply divided Supreme Court ruled Thursday that
people who suffer from the virus that causes AIDS enjoy the same
federal protection from discrimination as other disabled
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   In a 5-4 decision, the high court said the Americans with
Disabilities Act covers people with the human immunodeficiency
virus, or HIV, regardless of whether they show symptoms. The law
protects people with disabilities that ``substantially'' limit
their ability to perform a major life activity; HIV sufferers are
restricted from engaging in the major activity of reproduction
because of the danger the disease presents to a victim's sexual
partner and offspring, the justices said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The act addresses substantial limitations on major life
activities, not utter inabilities,'' Justice Anthony M. Kennedy
wrote in the court's majority opinion. ``Conception and childbirth
are not impossible for an HIV victim but, without doubt, are
dangerous to the public health. This meets the definition of a
substantial limitation.''
</P>
<P>
   Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, David H. Souter
and John Paul Stevens joined Kennedy's opinion.
</P>
<P>
   In their decision, the justices sent the case back to a federal
appeals court to decide whether a dentist was justified under the
law when he refused to treat a patient who suffers from HIV in his
office.
</P>
<P>
   Randon Bragdon of Bangor, Maine, offered to fill Sidney Abbott's
cavity in a more antiseptic hospital room, where the doctor said
his chances of contracting HIV from his patient were much less than
they were in his office.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott sued Bragdon, alleging discrimination under the law. The
U.S. District Court in Maine and the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals agreed with the patient. The 1st Circuit now must determine
whether Abbott's HIV presented what the law calls ``a direct threat
to the health or safety'' of Bragdon or his assistants in the
office.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, in a concurring opinion Breyer joined, said the high
court should have taken the additional step and ruled that Bragdon
was not justified in refusing to treat Abbott in the office. The
1st Circuit has already ruled Abbott's HIV presented no direct
threat, Stevens added.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, however,
disagreed with the court's conclusion that reproduction is a major
life activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can deny that reproductive decisions are important in a
person's life,'' Rehnquist wrote. ``But so are decisions as to who
to marry, where to live and how to earn one's living.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief justice said major life activities are those that are
``repetitively performed and essential in the day-to-day existence
of a normally functioning'' person. ``They are thus quite different
from the series of activities leading to the birth of a child,'' he
wrote in a dissent joined by Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence
Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate dissent, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said neither
the law nor federal regulations intended for reproduction to be
considered a major life activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my view, the act of giving birth to a child, while a very
important part of the lives of many women, is not generally the
same as the representative major life activities of all persons _
`caring for one's self, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing,
hearing, speaking, breathing, learning and working' _ listed in
regulations relevant to the Americans with Disabilities Act of
1990.``
</P>
<P>
   Gay rights supporters and the dentist's attorney hailed the
decision as a victory for their respective positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Supreme Court unequivocally recognized the right of people
with HIV and other disabilities to full protection from
discrimination,`` said Catherine Hanssens, AIDS project director
for the gay rights group Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund.
``I am heartened the court saw that Congress intended the ADA to
provide such broad protection _ that irrational discrimination
should not be allowed to keep people with HIV from health care and
services.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney John W. McCarthy said he and Bragdon are ``ecstatic''
about the Supreme Court's decision after his client lost in the
lower federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He Bragdon believes he should be able to exercise his
professional judgment'' when treating patients with HIV, McCarthy
added. ``We're going to have another chance to file briefs and
argue the issue all over again.''

 &HT;    New details emrge at Fagan's arraignment
 &HT;    By John Holland
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Stephen Fagan fled to Florida carting not
just his two confused, ``shell shocked'' daughters, but also a
detailed plan to elude capture and deceive his children,
prosecutors said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Outlining their case at Fagan's arraignment, prosecutors said
Fagan secured false passports for himself and daughters Rachael and
Lisa, then 5 and 2, just days after he kidnapped them during a 1979
custody dispute. Within two weeks he had obtained two phony Social
Security numbers for himself, a driver license and a new identity
as William Stephen Martin, grieving widower, court records show.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan picked up the girls for a weekend visit on Oct. 25, 1979,
and never returned them to his ex-wife, Barbara Kurth. Fagan claims
Kurth was an unfit mother, although state investigators and a judge
found the allegations baseless.
</P>
<P>
   Rachael and Wendy strongly support their father and have refused
to be reunited with their mother. Thursday, the girls and Fagan's
fourth wife, Harriet, again stood with him as he pleaded not guilty
to kidnapping and contempt of court charges.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the group stood arm-in-arm before a phalanx of
photographers and reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan's life as a fugitive began at the Key West home of Carolyn
Garrison, an old friend from his days as a bartender at one of
Boston's most notorious nightclubs, according to a statement
released by Assistant District Attorney Lynn Reilly. Fagan told
Garrison and the girls that their mother had died, apparently from
a car accident, Garrison testified at a grand jury hearing earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defendant arrived (in Key West) with Rachael and Wendy,
who were, as Ms. Garrison describes, shell shocked,'' prosecutors
said in a court document filed Thursday. ``(Fagan) told Ms.
Garrison that the police had found Barbara's car by the side of the
road and they believed her to be dead.''
</P>
<P>
   He then changed Wendy's first name to Lisa. ``When Wendy asked
why, he simply said that it was her middle name and that was what
he intended to call her,'' prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan was arrested on April 16, but under Massachusetts law had
to be arraigned again in Superior Court, where the two felony
counts of kidnapping carry sentences up to 10 years each. He
remains free on $250,000 cash bond, although prosecutors and a
judge added a new stipulation to the bail.
</P>
<P>
   A judge sealed the new bond provision from the public.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, prosecutors tried to show Fagan planned the escape in
advance. They noted that he transferred ownership of his home to
his parents nearly a year before he fled. Then, just a week after
disappearing, they sold it to Boston attorney Richard Egbert.
</P>
<P>
   Egbert now represents Fagan, though he said the sale was just a
``historical coincidence.''

 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court upheld a congressional decency
test for awarding federal arts grants on Thursday, but only after a
majority of the justices interpreted the 1990 law as containing
only ``advisory language'' that did not actually prohibit federal
subsidies for indecent art.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the court strongly suggested, in a majority opinion by
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, that if the law was invoked to impose
``a penalty on disfavored viewpoints,'' it would violate the First
Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 8-1 to uphold the disputed provision, which
requires the National Endowment for the Arts to take into account
``general standards of decency and respect for the diverse beliefs
and values of the American public'' when making grants. But the
court was more divided than the vote indicated.
</P>
<P>
   Two members of the majority, Justices Antonin Scalia and
Clarence Thomas, objected strenuously to their colleagues'
interpretation of the statute as basically toothless. ``The
operation was a success, but the patient died,'' Scalia said of the
majority's work in a separate concurring opinion that took a very
different view of a law.
</P>
<P>
   The law as properly interpreted ``unquestionably constitutes
viewpoint discrimination,'' Scalia wrote, saying there was no
problem with such discrimination in the selective disbursement of
federal subsidies. He added that even an outright ban on federal
financing of indecent art would be constitutional as well.
</P>
<P>
   He said the majority had regrettably upheld the law only by
gutting it. ``The most avid congressional opponents of the
provision could not have asked for more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Only Justice David Souter, in a lone dissenting opinion,
interpreted the provision both as having real force, and as
violating the First Amendment. ``A statute disfavoring speech that
fails to respect Americans' `diverse beliefs and values' is the
very model of viewpoint discrimination,'' Souter said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came in a case originally brought against the
national endowment by the performance artist Karen Finley and three
other non-mainstream artists, who were initially denied grants as
the dispute over financing indecent art was heating up but shortly
before Congress adopted the provision currently at issue.
</P>
<P>
   They then amended their lawsuit, added more plaintiffs, and won
both in the Federal District Court in Los Angeles and the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, in San Francisco. The provision has been
legally unenforceable since 1992 under an injunction that the
ruling on Thursday has the effect of lifting.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, National Endowment for the Arts vs. Finley, No.
97-371, amounted to something of an inconclusive stand-off with an
odd twist: it was the Clinton administration, appealing the lower
court decision and seeking to defend the law, that put forward the
interpretation of a provision with essentially no bite or practical
effect, while the challengers described the law as far-reaching and
constitutionally intrusive.
</P>
<P>
   In the years it took the case to reach the Supreme Court, the
controversy over federal subsidies for indecent art has raged on
and, to some extent, moved on. Congress has slashed the endowment's
budget and has come close to eliminating the agency entirely, while
the endowment itself has basically stopped making grants to
individual artists.
</P>
<P>
   Two relatively small grants in 1989, $30,000 for a retrospective
of sexually explicit photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe and $15,000
to the artist Andres Serrano, who photographed a crucifix immersed
in his own urine and called the work ``Piss Christ,'' ignited the
furor that has never completely died down.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of the ruling on Thursday permitted both the
Endowment and House Speaker Newt Gingrich to praise the court and
claim victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today the Supreme Court validated the right of the American
people to not pay for art that offends their sensibilities,'' the
speaker said.
</P>
<P>
   William Ivey, chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts,
said the ruling was ``a reaffirmation of the agency's discretion in
funding the highest quality art in America'' and would not affect
``our day-to-day operations.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Justice O'Connor's opinion was joined by Chief Justice William
Rehnquist and by Justices John Paul Stevens, Anthony Kennedy,
Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Justice O'Connor said that
in adopting the requirement that decency be taken into
consideration, Congress imposed ``no categorical requirement'' and
``declined to disallow any particular viewpoints.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not perceive a realistic danger'' that the law will
``compromise First Amendment values,'' she said. But she added,
``If the NEA were to leverage its power to award subsidies on the
basis of subjective criteria into a penalty on disfavored
viewpoints, then we would confront a different case.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN BEGIN HERE)
</P>
<P>
   While the justices disagreed on whether the law imposed
viewpoint discrimination, all nine were in agreement on one point:
that the law was not unconstitutionally vague, as the plaintiffs
had argued and the Ninth Circuit had concluded. While the
provision's ``undeniably opaque'' terms might raise constitutional
questions if they appeared in a criminal statute, O'Connor said,
``when the government is acting as patron rather than as sovereign,
the consequences of imprecision are not constitutionally severe.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the government awarded fellowships on the basis of such
inherently subjective criteria as ``excellence,'' adding that to
strike down the decency provision as vague ``would be to call into
question the constitutionality of these valuable government
programs and countless others like them.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Overshadowed in the court's burst of activity were these other
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Self-Incrimination
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled, 7-2, that the Fifth Amendment does not provide
a right against compelled self-incrimination for a person who fears
prosecution in a foreign country. The decision resolved a split in
the lower federal courts in cases involving suspected wartime Nazi
collaborators who are being investigated by the Justice Department
for possible deportation.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, United States vs. Balsys, No. 97-873, the 2nd U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, in New York, had ruled last year that a
Lithuanian immigrant could refuse to testify in the preliminary
investigation due to his fear that if he were deported to
Lithuania, Israel or Germany, his testimony would be used against
him in criminal prosecutions. In an opinion on Thursday by Souter,
the court overturned that ruling and held that ``concern with
foreign prosecution is beyond the scope of the Self-Incrimination
Clause'' of the Fifth Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Deportation is a civil proceeding, and because the Fifth
Amendment applies only in the criminal context, the immigrant,
Aloyzas Balsys, has no basis for claiming the privilege in the
domestic case. He claims to have been in hiding during the war, but
the government now suspects that he actively participated in
persecuting Jews in Lithuania and that he lied on his application
for a visa to enter the United States in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Souter said the court had to take seriously the government's
view that ``domestic law enforcement would suffer serious
consequences if fear of foreign prosecution were recognized as
sufficient to invoke the privilege.''
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg and Breyer dissented. ``The basic values which this
court has said underlie the Fifth Amendment's protections are each
diminished if the privilege may not be claimed here,'' Breyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Retroactive Liability
</P>
<P>
   Voting 5-4, the court declared unconstitutional a 1992 law that
required companies that had once been in the coal mining business
to assume retroactive liability for lifetime health benefits for
miners and the survivors and families of miners who had worked for
them decades earlier. The law was enacted to address a crisis in
coal industry health benefits, partly due to the departure of many
companies from the mining business.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, Eastern Enterprises vs. Apfel, No. 97-42, would
have had potentially sweeping constitutional implications had a
majority been able to agree on a rationale for striking down the
Coal Act. But only a plurality of four justices, in an opinion by
O'Connor, found that the law imposed an unconstitutional ``taking''
of the companies' property. The other three were Rehnquist, Scalia
and Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth member of the majority, Kennedy, said the takings
clause of the Fifth Amendment was inapplicable, because only a
general financial liability, and not property, was involved.
Rather, he said, the law violated the companies' right to due
process.
</P>
<P>
   The dissenters, Breyer, Stevens, Souter, and Ginsburg, agreed
that the due process analysis was the correct one, but said there
was no due process violation.
</P>
<P>
   The most unusual opinion _ perhaps of the entire day _ was a
one-paragraph separate concurring opinion by Thomas. He said the
law should be seen as violating the constitutional prohibition
against ex post facto legislation, and called for reconsideration
of a 200-year-old Supreme Court precedent that had limited the ex
post facto clause to criminal laws.

GINGRICH CLARIFIES GOP STANDS ON TRADE

 By ALISON MITCHELL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As President Clinton arrived in China, House
Speaker Newt Gingrich suddenly stepped forward Thursday to polish
Republican credentials on an array of international issues, from
trade relations with China to long-stalled financing for the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, a Georgia Republican, promised that Congress would try
again this September to give President Clinton expanded ''fast
track'' trade negotiating authority _ an issue that sharply divides
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only country economically strong enough to keep the world
economy moving forward is the United States,'' Gingrich said. ``The
trick is for us to send a signal that we want a stronger and more
vibrant world market, and that means a strong vote on fast track.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich made his announcement standing with a bipartisan group
of lawmakers from farm states who have come under increasing
pressure from agricultural and business groups on issues affecting
global trade, particularly the economic crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Some corporate leaders complain that Republicans are threatening
American competitiveness by opposing satellite deals with China and
supporting sanctions against countries charged with religious
persecution. The House has also been holding up an $18 billion
contribution to the IMF, which the administration says is needed to
maintain economic stability in Asia and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of discontent, Charles Mack and Bernadette Budde of
the Business-Industry PAC, which makes recommendations to corporate
political action committees, wrote to members in March, ``How
ironic that, after decades of GOP rhetoric pledging fealty to free
enterprise, global competition and less government interference,
business cannot rely on a Republican Congress to advance these
principles.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's stance Thursday won instant praise from the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce and allowed farm state lawmakers to go home for
the Independence Day recess with promises of action to lift farm
exports. But the speaker's move seemed aimed at seeking partisan
advantage at least as much as resolving the disputes festering in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fast track'' legislation would grant the president the right
to negotiate trade agreements that Congress can approve or reject,
but not amend. In a severe setback for Clinton, such legislation
was pulled from the House floor last November because it failed to
garner enough votes for passage. The opposition was led by House
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., who carried the majority of
House Democrats with him.
</P>
<P>
   Granting such presidential powers over trading agreements is
considered even more difficult to pass in an election year, and the
White House already indicated it would not seek another vote on the
issue before the mid-term elections. By scheduling a vote in
September, the Republicans would split the Democrats at the moment
when they most need Clinton to be campaigning for them in the
midterm election.
</P>
<P>
   Both the White House and Gephardt on Thursday called the
financing of the IMF more pressing than ``fast track.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think from an economic point of view, the financial crisis
in Asia has a much more direct impact on the economic well-being of
Americans and that issue needs to be dealt with first,'' said Joe
Lockhart, a spokesman for Clinton. As for the fast track, Gephardt
called a new debate ``simply irrelevant at this juncture.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gingrich said he thought ``fast track'' legislation could gain
more votes this year because of the Asian crisis and a decline in
farm prices. ``My instinct is that a lot of members who were
wavering last fall now realize that it's very important for us to
pass this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the IMF, Gingrich said he was looking for a bipartisan
agreement, with strings attached. ``We think that it's very, very
important that we have legitimate oversight and legitimate checks
on exactly what the IMF is doing, where it's been successful, and
where it's frankly just caused more problems than it's helped,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted 84-16 in March to provide the IMF with the full
$18 billion sought by the Clinton administration, provided certain
conditions were met by the lender. But the House demanded far
greater changes in the way the agency operates. And last year it
tied IMF financing to an abortion dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich did not indicate Thursday what level of funding he
would support or what conditions the House would impose on the
agency. But he acknowledged that the problems in Asia and Russia
have heightened the need for Congress to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the kind of changes you have in Indonesia, in Russia and
in South Korea, and the potential challenges in Japan, we have an
obligation to work with the International Monetary Fund,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the difficulties Gingrich could face from other
Republicans, however, Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the House Majority
Whip, immediately denounced the fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giving the IMF more money is not a panacea for all the
troubles that bedevil the Asian economy,'' he said. ``In fact, in
many instances, the IMF is the problem, not the solution.''
</P>
<P>
   On another issue that Gingrich termed of ``critical
importance,'' the House Ways and Means Committee on Thursday came
out strongly in favor of giving China the normal trade status
accorded most other nations.
</P>
<P>
   The president has called for an annual renewal of such ties,
over objections from critics who cite China's human rights abuses,
its occupation of Tibet, and allegations that China tried to
influence elections in the United States through campaign
donations. To stop Clinton from giving the renewal, Congress would
have to pass a resolution of disapproval. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ One good thing about ``The Art of the Motorcycle,''
opening Friday at the Guggenheim, is that by the time it's over
everyone should finally be sick and tired of jokes about the museum
as a big parking garage ramp.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Lloyd Wright know-it-alls, upon reading this sentence, are
probably already preparing letters to the effect that the
Guggenheim's design originated in a plan of Wright's during the
1920s to build a planetarium encircled by a kind of double-helix
system of ramps, a ziggurat for cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you see,'' these letters will no doubt say, ``the idea of
motorcycles in the Guggenheim is, in fact, a fulfillment . . . ''
Blah, blah, blah.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for the record, as far as motorcycles go, I drove a scooter
in Cozumel, Mexico, once, and as a boy I pedaled around Manhattan
on a banana bike, the kind that had the ``Easy Rider'' handlebars _
or in the biker lingo of the Guggenheim's He-man-size exhibition
catalog, ``ape hanger'' handlebars.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and I have visited the Henry Ford Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Having thus firmly established my bona fides, let me make the
following observations:
</P>
<P>
   1. The show, historically speaking, covers the ground between an
1868 French velocipede with a steam engine beneath the seat (ouch!)
and a sleek new MV Agusta. With 113 motorcycles, it is much too
big, but many of the bikes in it really are great to look at, and
you don't have to have a tattoo or know what a single-overhead-cam
valve gear with enclosed rockers is to admire them. I suspect that
men who have been dragged to Monet exhibitions over the years will
seek revenge here, though anyone with design sense will do fine in
it.
</P>
<P>
   2. Frank Gehry's installation of the exhibition, which includes
shiny stainless-steel panels along the rotunda side of Wright's
ramp, miraculously dematerializes the rotunda and suddenly makes
the inside of the museum resemble a machine: an apt metaphor. At
the same time, the panels nod to Gehry's Wright-influenced,
titanium-clad Guggenheim in Bilbao, so the whole effect is a kind
of spiral of allusion.
</P>
<P>
   3. Yes, it is weird to find motorcycles in the Guggenheim, which
has never done anything quite like this before, but American art
museums have always shown objects of design. And anyway, much of
the art in the Metropolitan, never mind the Modern or the
Cooper-Hewitt, originally had a practical purpose, whether it was a
bowl or a chariot. Motorcycles, better than many things, illustrate
technology and taste as they have evolved together in the 20th
century, which is an issue basic to modern art. Looking at one of
the earliest bikes here, an 1893 Millet from France, I thought of
``Ballet Mecanique,'' the machine age film that Leger, Gerald
Murphy, Man Ray and George Antheil made in the 1920s. It made
abstractions out of close-ups of churning engines like the
Millet's.
</P>
<P>
   4. Besides, the Guggenheim under Thomas Krens, to the
consternation of many people, has been stretching in new
directions, which isn't bad. Listed as the main curator for this
show, he has lately been tooling around on a BMW motorcycle, so he
can now officially be regarded as the biker outlaw of museum
directors.
</P>
<P>
   5.. Apropos of BMW, there have been complaints in the press
about the company's sponsorship of ``The Art of the Motorcycle'' _
and one can't help wondering which came first, the idea for the
exhibition or the realization that money would be available for
such a show. The museum is quick to counter that among the bikes on
view, 6 are BMWs, 10 are Harley-Davidsons, 9 are Hondas. OK,
corporate support doesn't necessarily mean corporate noodling in
curatorial decisions. But the true test of any show's credibility
is what it adds to the sum of human knowledge and happiness. Which
brings me to:
</P>
<P>
   6. The catalog, a curious document. Clearly it wants to be
scholarly. One essay informs us that: ``Neither writing nor riding
is possible without a certain violence. As the writer inscribes
paper with ink and words, so the motorcyclist cuts a line through
sheer space using angles and velocity as letters and punctuation.''
</P>
<P>
   And: ``The pipes are to the motorcyclist's identity what the
unconscious is to the Freudian subject: a large inaccessible
reservoir of feeling and meaning, which is a remainder of a
collective spirit. In both cases, one must listen at least twice
for the significance of the utterances.''
</P>
<P>
   At least.
</P>
<P>
   As for the catalog entries on each bike, some are good, some are
like this: ``The geared primary drive and multi-plate clutch, which
were on the left side, transmitted power to a four-speed gearbox.
The full-circle crankshaft featured a roller big-end bearing, with
a bronze small end bush. Lubrication was wet-sump, with a gear-type
oil pump.''
</P>
<P>
   I can only assume that this makes sense to mechanics and,
perhaps, sexologists.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the photographs are cool.
</P>
<P>
   So we take this show seriously at a certain peril, which is
fitting because motorcycles are frivolous to begin with: they're
about irresponsibility, about not conforming, about getting away.
Or at least they're about embracing the image of nonconformity.
Motorcyclists are also famous for riding in packs and dressing
alike. Every society has its rules, even Hell's Angels.
</P>
<P>
   That's just one cultural cliche motorcycles neatly reflect. An
early American bike, the bright orange and white 1911 Flying
Merkel, summons to mind tinted postcard images of barber shop
quartets, brass bands and summer fairs. I picture a snake-oil
salesman, in boater hat and high collar, riding one. The huge 1948
Indian Chief, the apex of mid-century kitsch (pinstripes, decals,
big red swooping fenders), in the same way encapsulates America's
extravagant postwar spirit. It's the motorcycle equivalent of the
Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   For another reason I like British bikes. They tend to be black
and practical, with sturdy engines and no frills, and, so I'm told,
they're a pain to kick-start. They evoke the ethos of tinned food
and vast unheated manor houses. Take the 1926 Brough Superior
SS100, massive and not obviously beautiful but very elegant on its
own terms. (It's T.E. Lawrence's bike.) Likewise, the classic 1939
Triumph seems to embody pragmatism on two wheels.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition has sales brochures and magazine ads to
illustrate the marketing of bikes in different countries to suit
diverse tastes. In the early 60s, for instance, Japanese companies,
in the wake of similar efforts by British manufacturers like
Triumph and American makers like Harley-Davidson, made a mark with
bikes geared to a growing affluent populace of anti-outlaws.
</P>
<P>
   Honda's ads showed clean-cut families with efficient little
vehicles like the Super Cub. The company's famous slogan was ``You
meet the nicest people on a Honda.'' Then it became ``The new
American motorcycle gang.'' The standard view of Japan is that it
has always adapted other cultures, then often surpassed them.
That's what you see here in later years, as well, when Japanese
manufacturers mimicked stripped-down American muscle bikes of the
'70s and '80s.
</P>
<P>
   These muscle bikes are ugly, but that's the point, I suppose.
Esthetically, I prefer a stylish eccentric like the streamlined
1930 French Majestic 350, canary yellow and blue, the engine and
wheels wrapped in bullet-shaped fairing with vents on the sides.
Tres chic. Even when the French tried to imitate American swagger
they remained French. The 1933 Dollar is a tough, compact bike with
an Indian-head gas cap and decal, but the Jaeger clock with its
dandyish Roman numerals is a Gallic giveaway.
</P>
<P>
   I must mention the show-stopper, a 1925 Boehmerland, a Czech
novelty resembling a circus prop. Red and yellow, it has a wooden
sidecar in the shape of a rocket and is bigger than many
automobiles. The museum label says the bike carries six people.
That seems like a small exaggeration. Six clowns maybe.
</P>
<P>
   In the end the Italians, naturally, make the really
memorable-looking motorcycles. Check out the enveloping shape of
the 1958 Aermacchi Chimera; the surreal 1995 Aprilia Moto 6.5,
designed by Philippe Starck, which resembles a wasp, and the MV
Agusta F4, whose frame and exposed machinery can bring to mind the
body of a sleek swimmer. These are truly beautiful objects.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the Vespa. Sophia Loren. The Via Veneto.
``Roman Holiday.'' ``La Dolce Vita,'' and that unmistakable drone
of the Vespa's engine, like a throaty laugh. I recall the famous
1953 photograph by Mario De Biasi of a woman striding toward a
group of goggle-eyed Italian men. The man nearest to her sits on
(what else?) a Vespa.
</P>
<P>
   To anyone who really knows motorcycles, it's probably one of the
least exciting bikes in the show. But I don't care. It's the one I
want.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``The Art of the Motorcycle'' remains at the Guggenheim Museum,

ANALYSIS: REGIONAL BELLS SEE BENEFITS IN AT&AMP;T-TCI DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After AT&AMP;T said Wednesday that it had agreed to acquire
Tele-Communications Inc. for $31.8 billion, the stock of the five
regional Bell telephone companies dropped by almost 4 percent on
average, shaving about $11 billion from their combined market
value.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, the thinking went, had lessened its need to use the Bells'
networks to reach local customers. By linking to consumers through
TCI's extensive cable television system, which reaches 10.5 million
homes, AT&AMP;T could reduce the amount it pays the Bells to begin and
end long-distance calls, while building a platform to offer local
phone service and high-speed access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Bells' reaction Thursday: good riddance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who had the bigger celebration _ them or us,''
said James Ellis, general counsel of SBC Communications Inc., which
groups Southwestern Bell and Pacific Telesis.
</P>
<P>
   In the long-running battle between the Bells and the nation's
big long-distance companies, spin tactics have become almost as
valuable as a powerful friend in Washington. But the Bells on
Thursday seemed genuine in welcoming the deal, or at least in
declining to condemn it. The Bells think that AT&AMP;T's acquisition of
TCI can ultimately help them reach their pot of gold at the end of
the optical fiber: the $80 billion long-distance market. They may
be right.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is clearly in the direction that the FCC wanted,'' said
Stephanie Comfort, chief telecommunications analyst for Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter. ``As the alternative pipe becomes available,
that helps the Bells.''
</P>
<P>
   The Telecommunications Act of 1996 said the Bells would be
allowed to sell long-distance service only after convincing
regulators that they had opened their local networks to potential
competitors. The act carried a checklist of technical requirements
the Bells must meet before winning long-distance approval.
</P>
<P>
   No Bell has yet won that approval, in part because AT&AMP;T, MCI
Communications and other big long-distance companies have
vigorously maintained that they have been kept out of local markets
by recalcitrant Bells. The Bells have generally said that their
networks are open but that AT&AMP;T and MCI are dragging their heels in
order to protect their long-distance businesses.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T chairman C. Michael Armstrong had a strong case Wednesday
when he said that argument ought to be laid to rest. But by doing
that, he may also given the Bells a boost in their quest for
long-distance glory.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to concerns that local markets are not open to
competition, Bell Atlantic Corp. chief executive Ivan Seidenberg
said Thursday, ``This puts a fire under everyone suggesting those
concerns should come down fast now that King Kong and Godzilla just
got together.''
</P>
<P>
   Sid Boren, BellSouth Corp.'s executive vice president for
planning, development and administration, said, ``It gives us
leverage to use on the long-distance applications.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This returns the telecom act to where everyone thought it
would be in 1996,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The Bells believe that the presence of competition from a
cable-based phone system would be a huge factor in their favor when
they petition the Federal Communications Commission for permission
to sell long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, which advises the FCC on the petitions,
has said that it will recommend approval only for Bells that
demonstrate that their markets are ``irreversibly open'' to
competition.
</P>
<P>
   The concern has been that after allowing a competitor to gain a
local foothold using a Bell network (and winning entry to the
long-distance market), the Bell could backslide and unfairly
eliminate the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Boren said AT&AMP;T's deployment of a cable-based phone system would
not depend on the Bells in a major way and so any offering of
service using a cable system could fairly be deemed irreversible
and not vulnerable to potential Bell ``backsliding''.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the Bells which, during drafting of the
telecommunications act, argued against a strict market test for
determining when they could sell long-distance service. The
long-distance companies floated plans that would have allowed the
Bells to sell long-distance service once they had lost a certain
percentage of their local markets, regardless of the state of the
Bells' networks.
</P>
<P>
   The Bells refused. And so the checklist of conditions was put in
place. AT&AMP;T argues that the Bells still have to meet the checklist
before getting into the long-distance market, even if AT&AMP;T is
making inroads in the market.
</P>
<P>
   A high-ranking FCC official agreed with AT&AMP;T in principle. The
official indicated, however, that in areas where AT&AMP;T offered
service through cable TV wires, local Bells would not have to meet
as rigorous a test.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the market is looking competitive, and there's real
facilities to bypass the Bell company network, then it just sort of
changes the way you look at the item,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   That is just what the Bells are counting on.
</P>
<P>
   ``AT&AMP;T has always said we need an industrial-strength OSS
system,'' said Mark Roellig, U S West's executive vice president
for pubic policy, human resources and law, referring to one of the
systems that would allow other companies to link to a Bell's
network. By working through TCI's system, Roellig said, ``They
clearly don't need industrial strength OSS because they will be
proving most of the services over their own network.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest hurdle between the Bells and the
long-distance market over the next few years could be AT&AMP;T's
stumbles in upgrading TCI's cable networks to offer widespread
phone and data service. AT&AMP;T has not offered any technical details
of its plans and has not said how much it intends to spend to make
new services available.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Rosenblum, AT&AMP;T's vice president for law and public policy,
said the Bells ought to be let into the long-distance arena when
there is widespread competition for local service. But he added
that that day may not be near and said the Bells were jumping the
gun in using the merger announcement as a platform to press for
quicker long-distance approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're offering a lot of good things to give people choice,''
he said. ``But it is going to take a while for those good things to
actually hit the ground for consumers. What the Bell companies
continue to do is confuse plans and realities.''

BOSTON MULLS RETURN TO SCHOOL PLAN THAT IGNITED BUSING CONFLICT 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ ``Neighborhood schools'' is a fraught, to some even
frightening, phrase here.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a quarter-century ago, it was the rallying slogan of
those who opposed forced busing to achieve school integration;
today, it can still conjure up images of angry protesters and
nightstick-swinging police officers in the white enclaves of
Charlestown and South Boston, of saucer-eyed children watching
adult violence from their school-bus windows.
</P>
<P>
   For all that historical baggage, however, the Boston School
Committee on Wednesday night is scheduled to take up the issue of
whether to move back toward neighborhood schools, reopening the old
debate despite any trepidation because, backers of the proposal
say, it simply seems time. The court-decreed busing ended more than
a decade ago, but the system that replaced it has kept many
children from attending the school nearest their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The basic issue sounds much the same as 25 years ago, but the
city and its school system have changed tremendously _ from a
public-school population that was nearly 60 percent white to one
that is nearly 85 percent minority; from largely segregated black
and white neighborhoods to more melanges of black, white, Hispanic
and Asian areas; from an explosive focus on race to more of a focus
on basic quality in the perennially troubled Boston schools.
</P>
<P>
   Along with those changes, political pressure from advocates of
neighborhood schools has mounted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's at the point where you can't ignore it anymore,'' said
Peggy Davis-Mullen, a member of the Boston City Council who has
been pushing for neighborhood schools for nearly a decade and
almost got the issue put on the city ballot last year. ``It was a
taboo thing to talk about; politically, people were just terrified
and would not talk about it, and I think that people have seen that
you can survive and make this political argument _ it doesn't mean
you're a racist.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan to be discussed at the Wednesday meeting, still
tentative in its particulars and not likely to be voted on for
months, is actually called not ``neighborhood schools'' but a
``cluster model,'' and it would offer only a partial return to the
pre-busing system in which students mainly went to the schools
nearest their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed plan would divide the city into 10 geographical
clusters, and students would generally attend schools within their
cluster. They would choose from a narrower array of schools than
now, but have a greater guarantee of being able to attend a school
near home.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Schools Superintendent Thomas Payzant is presenting the
plan in response to a school committee study group's
recommendations. Payzant said he was withholding judgment on it
until he could determine how it would play out, and whether it
would keep schools racially as diverse as now.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the plan offers some promise, the superintendent said,
including the prospect that it would cut students' traveling time
to school and some of the transportation costs that now take up $42
million in the school system's total annual budget of $547 million.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether he thought issues of race would hamper the
plan, Payzant said, ``I really don't think it will be the major
question.'' Rather, he said he expected the debate to pit advocates
of maximum school choice who do not want their children's options
limited against advocates of neighborhood schools who value
proximity.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But others, including integration experts and some parents, say
they still worry about the potential rise in racial tensions and
the possibility that the city's 63,000 public school pupils will
become resegregated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston students have been going to school peacefully as far as
race is concerned for a decade,'' said Charles Willie, the Harvard
urban sociologist and school integration specialist who helped
design the school assignment system now in place, ``and there's a
question, Why return to what was a source of a great deal of strife
in the past?''
</P>
<P>
   Boston's court-ordered busing system, the forced desegregation
that spawned such conflict in the 1970s that the city became a
symbol of Northern urban racism, began when a U.S. District Court
ruled that the schools had been intentionally segregated. Students
were bused so that the enrollment in each school would more closely
reflect the racial makeup of the city.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, the schools were deemed sufficiently integrated to to
allow the court-ordered busing system to be ended. In 1989, it was
replaced by a system called ``controlled choice,'' in which the
city was divided into three big zones and students were allowed to
choose among about 27 schools in their zone, as long as all the
schools remained well-integrated. The cluster plan would reduce
that choice to 7 to 10 schools.
</P>
<P>
   Race may not be a central focus of the new plan, but it already
permeates the emerging debate.
</P>
<P>
   There is, for example, the plan's greatest practical rub: Among
the things that have changed over the last 25 years, one is that
scores of Boston schools have been closed or converted into housing
complexes for the elderly or offices, reducing the total to 128
from 208. And the closed schools have tended to be in predominantly
poor and minority areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm against it only in that there are neighborhoods that do
not have schools,'' said Hattie McKinnis, executive director of the
Citywide Parents Council, which is an advocate for parents in the
school system, ``and that's basically in communities of color _
Roxbury, Mattapan and Dorchester _ so it would be unfair. It means
these kids will constantly be getting on a bus to go to somebody
else's school.''
</P>
<P>
   The cluster plan appears politically unstoppable, Ms. McKinnis
said, adding that she hoped the city would not fall back into its
old habits of shortchanging minority children.
</P>
<P>
   There is also what some see as the racially tilted side-agenda
of the cluster plan: To lure back into the school system the
whites, and in general the working and middle classes of all races,
who have fled it in such prodigious numbers. The city over all is
still almost 60 percent white; but half its white students _ and
one-quarter its black students _ go to parochial or other private
schools.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is there aren't enough white kids in the
Boston public school system anymore to have any kind of racial
balance,'' said James Kelly, president of the Boston City Council,
who believes the cluster model does not go far enough toward
neighborhood schools.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of neighborhood schools argue that white students are
bused to distant schools disproportionately to fill racial quotas.
Many minority students are also bussed to distant schools attended
mainly by other poor minority students to fill seats when, cluster
proponents say, they would be better off staying in schools nearer
their homes, where it is easier to attend after-school programs.
</P>
<P>
   Other cities in similar situations have been moving away from
busing to end segregation as court orders have expired, prompting
concerns from some scholars of integration that some schools are
becoming resegregated.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, a federal judge accepted an agreement for Indianapolis
to phase out the city's 1981 court-ordered desegregation plan,
which involved the busing of several thousand black students to
schools in the city's suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, parents appear split on the cluster proposal. Some
said they preferred the option of choosing among more schools and
seeing their children bused rather than walking city streets to
schools nearer home; others, like Estelle Reason, who was picking
up her granddaughter, Chandra, at a Roxbury school the other day,
said she thought that children should stay close to home and that
busing money be plowed directly into education instead.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Reason, who is black, remembers being forced to send her son
to school in all-white Charlestown at the height of the busing
tension. ``That put me in bed for a week,'' she said. ``I had to go
up on the school bus with my kids. They were fighting and fighting;
they were just looking to fight.''

ADVERTISING: TWO MAGAZINES TRYING UNCONVENTIONAL SUPPLEMENTS
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two magazines are supplementing their appeals to
readers and advertisers with unconventional supplements that are
appearing in issues now coming out.
</P>
<P>
   Out magazine teamed up with the Seagram Americas unit of the
Seagram Co. for an advertising supplement, called Out to Party,
that promotes summer entertaining as it sells seven Seagram liquor
brands like Chivas Regal Scotch whisky and Captain Morgan's rums.
And Wallpaper magazine published its first editorial supplement
ever, called the Stockholm Design Guide, which is all Sweden all
the time, from the subjects of the articles to the advertisers to
even the paper stock.
</P>
<P>
   The projects have more in common than sharing Absolut vodka as
an advertiser; Out's because Seagram imports the brand and
Wallpaper's because the distiller, Vin &AMP; Sprit AB, is Swedish. They
are both emblematic of the ambitious efforts by print media to find
nontraditional ways to attract and keep advertisers as competition
for marketers' dollars intensifies. The ferocity of that battle was
underscored in recent days with the closings of magazines including
Inside Sports, Financial World and Living Fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most magazines haven't asked themselves a fundamental
question: `What business am I in?''' said Arthur Shapiro, executive
vice president for marketing at Seagram Americas in New York.
``They're not in the business of selling ad space, but of building
relationships with advertisers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Only a handful are good at doing that,'' he added, ``but it's
incumbent upon them to market themselves, to come to us and say,
`Hey, I've got an idea for you,' because print is very cluttered.
Unless I can cut through the clutter, I'm not going to meet our
needs for brand development.''
</P>
<P>
   Seagram is the principal sponsor of the 32-page guide, which has
nine ad pages and a ``Brought to you by'' credit on the cover.
Other advertisers include Levi Strauss &AMP; Co., for Dockers khakis,
and Rhino Records, for a ``party pack'' of soul music compact
disks.
</P>
<P>
   The guide may be the first Seagram magazine insert that
advertises multiple brands, Shapiro said; while the recipes feature
Seagram brands by name, there are also some drinks with ingredients
not sold by Seagram like Triple Sec.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to spend money to say, `Hey, instead of Captain
Morgan's, use Bacardi,''' Shapiro said, laughing, ``but it does go
beyond our brands.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad supplement appears in the July issue of Out, which is the
first to be revamped by the magazine's new editor in chief, James
Collard. In addition to 140,000 copies bound into the issue,
260,000 copies are to be distributed at Gay Pride events, including
those this weekend in New York; at bars, clubs and restaurants in
20 large markets, and as an insert in the Tzabaco catalog, which
sells merchandise aimed at gay men and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was more planned out than D-Day,'' said Louis M.
Fabrizio, publisher at Out in New York, a unit of Out Publishing
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the idea in October 1996 and discussed it with another
company, but it never really got off the ground,'' he added.
``There are a million reasons why people can't do something, but
I've never heard them from Seagram.''
</P>
<P>
   The guide is among several alternative ad vehicles offered by
Out. For instance, the magazine runs a corporate image advertising
feature, called Companies That Care, in which marketers purchased
space to promote their diversity policies. Sponsors have included
the Eastman Kodak Co., Gap Inc., Honeywell Inc. and the Prudential
Insurance Co. of America.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to the Wallpaper project, the Stockholm editorial
supplement, which runs 68 pages, is being bundled with the
magazine's first single-theme issue, titled ``Wanderlust 1998'' and
focusing on worldwide travel.
</P>
<P>
   The supplement covers ``all the fields that fit into the realm
of Wallpaper,'' said Tyler Brule, editorial director of Wallpaper
in London, a youthful life-style magazine owned by the Time Life
Entertainment Group Ltd. unit of Time Warner Inc. ``And it allows
us to attract a number of advertisers who normally wouldn't come
into our book.''
</P>
<P>
   There are articles on Swedish design, architecture, fashion,
media, shopping and reklam nyheter (ad agency news), including
brief reports about shops like Lowe Brindfors, part of the Lowe
Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, and two Omnicom
Group units, TBWA Sweden, part of TBWA Worldwide, and Paradiset
DDB, part of DDB Needham Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we wanted to say is that Wallpaper, a magazine based in
London with an American parent, is a global magazine sold in almost
50 countries, and Stockholm, the 1998 European capital of culture,
is a great place to start,'' Brule said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were moments,'' he added, ``when I thought: `What have I
got myself into? It can't be Danish, Norwegian or Finnish; it has
to be Swedish.' But we're getting all these fantastic mentions in
Swedish papers _ not that I can read any of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Three organizations accounted for about half the 23 ad pages in
the supplement: Food from Sweden, the Stockholm Information Service
Convention and Visitors Bureau, and the Swedish Travel and Tourism
Council. In addition to Vin &AMP; Sprit, the Absolut distiller, which
took the back cover, advertisers include Ericsson AB, Victor
Hasselblad, Orrefors and Saab, jointly owned by Investor AB and the
General Motors Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agency scene is so hot in Stockholm, it's such a great
advertising town that people pulled out the stops for us,'' Brule
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wallpaper printed almost 200,000 copies of the supplement, which
is the magazine's regular press run. In addition to distribution
with newsstand and subscription copies of Wallpaper, the supplement
is to be available in most airport lounges of SAS, the Scandinavian
airline.
</P>
<P>
   For the next supplement, ``I'd like to look at North America,''
Brule said. ``Much as I would love to do my home country of Canada,
it will probably be about somewhere in the United States.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ People with HIV infection can be covered by the
federal law that bars discrimination on the basis of disability
even if they have no symptoms, the Supreme Court ruled Thursday in
a major victory for people with the virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Voting 5-4, the justices agreed with a federal appeals court's
ruling that a woman with asymptomatic HIV infection, who was
refused care in a dentist's office, met the definition of
disability under the Americans With Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   The court stopped short of ruling flatly that HIV infection is
automatically covered by the disability law, a question that
Justice Anthony Kennedy's majority opinion said was not necessary
to the decision. There is no dispute that people with AIDS symptoms
are disabled within the meaning of the 1990 law.
</P>
<P>
   The majority held that the woman's decision not to have children
because of her HIV-positive status brought her within the law's
definition of disability: an impairment that ``substantially
limits'' one or more ``major life activities.'' Reproduction is
such an activity, Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the opinion's scope was limited, its tone suggested
that in subsequent cases, all or almost all HIV-positive people
would be able to claim the law's protection. ``Major life
activities'' is a broad phrase that should be broadly interpreted
in light of the prospect of inevitable progression to a ``dread and
fatal disease,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond its application to the nearly 1 million people in the
United States who are HIV positive, the decision was important as
the court's first substantive review of the 8-year-old disability
law.
</P>
<P>
   The court's analysis suggested that the law would also cover
other conditions that some lower courts have regarded as beyond its
scope, including infertility, well-controlled diabetes and cancer
that is in remission after treatment. Kennedy said it was not
necessary for a life activity that is compromised by an impairment
to have a ``public, economic or daily character.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority opinion was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens,
David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer. Chief Justice
William Rehnquist dissented, as did Justices Antonin Scalia,
Clarence Thomas and Sandra Day O'Connor. The dissenters said that
reproduction was not a major life activity and that in any event
the ability to have a child was not ``substantially limited'' by
HIV infection in the way the law used that phrase.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, Bragdon vs. Abbott, No. 97-156, was short of a
complete victory for the patient, Sidney Abbott, who brought the
lawsuit in 1994. After finding that she was covered by the law, the
1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals went on to rule that despite his
fear of infection, the dentist, Randon Bragdon, had illegally
discriminated against her by refusing to treat her in his office,
in Bangor, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The justices vacated that final part of the ruling however,
ordering the appeals court, which sits in Boston, to take further
evidence on the question of risk. The disability act provides an
exception under which a person with an infectious condition need
not be treated if the condition ``poses a direct threat to the
health or safety of others,'' defined as a ``significant risk''
that cannot be eliminated by appropriate procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said that within the scope of this appeal, the Supreme
Court had not been able to review evidence on this question. He
said such evidence should be limited to ``objective, scientific
information,'' in particular the views of public health
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   This in itself was an important part of the ruling, because the
court rejected Bragdon's argument that the judgment of risk could
be made by the individual medical practitioner. Bragdon's personal
views should receive ``no special deference simply because he is a
health care professional,'' Kennedy said, adding that ``his belief
that a significant risk existed, even if maintained in good faith,
would not relieve him from liability'' if broadly accepted medical
evidence was to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Ms. Abbott said they were confident they would
prevail in the renewed lower court proceedings, in light of the
views of leading public health authorities on the safety of
treating HIV-positive patients and the absence of evidence that any
patient had ever transmitted HIV infection to a dentist.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, which entered the case in support of
Ms. Abbott, told the court that the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention had ``found the risk of HIV transmission in the dental
context so low as to be unquantifiable.''
</P>
<P>
   In his dissenting opinion, however, Rehnquist said that given
evidence that patients had transmitted the virus to health care
workers on 42 documented occasions, it was likely that Bragdon
could establish that it was ``objectively reasonable'' for him to
refuse to treat an infected patient in his office.
</P>
<P>
   The dentist &UR; , &LR;  alerted by Ms. Abbott's disclosure on a
new-patient information form that she had HIV, had offered to fill
her cavity in a hospital, where in fact he did not have privileges
to practice. It was at that point that she filed suit.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Her lawyer, Bennett Klein of Gay and Lesbian Advocates and
Defenders, a Boston public interest law firm, said he was
``elated'' by the decision, which he said would send a strong
signal to lower courts that all HIV-positive people are protected
under the law.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990 law offers broad protection against discrimination on
the basis of disability in employment and places of public
accommodation, which are defined as including medical offices. A
related law, the National Fair Housing Act Amendments of 1988, uses
the same definition of disability to prohibit discrimination in
housing.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Coles, director of the AIDS Project of the American
Civil Liberties Union, said the decision was important in
demonstrating that the court was willing to look at ``the basic
purpose of the Americans With Disabilities Act.'' Contrary to many
narrow lower court interpretations, Coles said, the law was
intended to be read ``not like an antitrust regulation but like a
civil rights law.''
</P>
<P>
   Ann Elizabeth Reesman, a lawyer here who filed a brief on behalf
of an employer group urging the court to reject reproduction as a
``major life activity,'' said the ruling had significantly
broadened the scope of the law. Employers will most likely find the
decision troublesome, she said, because ``reproduction is such a
broad term that it will be more difficult to tell who is covered
and what employers' obligations are.''

   Rich get richer; &QL; 
poor head home
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NANTES, France _ Things are normal. It remains a petit monde as far
as the current coupe thereof is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, 162 teams sought spots in France's World Cup
'98. Every continent except Antarctica, where the penguins are
still soccer-ignorant, would send its best to the planet's biggest
sporting fete. But with futbol's Sweet 16 almost set, it's pretty
clear the balance of power hasn't shifted in the 68-year history of
the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Every champion has come from Europe or South America. And
whatever happens today in Lens, where England and Colombia go to
war _ perhaps literally in the streets outside the stadium _ to lay
claim to the final spot in the knockout round of the tournament,
the two land masses will account for seven-eighths of the elite
field.
</P>
<P>
   Asia was shut out. North America and Africa, in turn, will be
represented by the lonely interlopers from Mexico and Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   And the former barely survived. Somehow, Mexico's hombres dug
deeply enough to forge a dramatic late tie against the Netherlands
on Thursday, good enough to obtain a second-round place, with help
from a Belgian draw with South Korea. But you can't take Mexico's
chances to make it to the Stade de France in Saint-Denis on July 12
too seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Their compadres north of the Rio Grande did them no favors.
Because of the hapless Americans' 1-0 defeat at Yugoslavia's hands,
Mexico must confront Germany, Cup holders in 1990 and '98's most
hardened entry.
</P>
<P>
   Europe, South America rule
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria? The Lions have the athletes and the wiliest of coaches
in Bora Milutinovic, a mercenary Serb who took the Americans into
the second round in 1994 and might be able to keep the
temperamental Nigerians tugging on the same rope, but they haven't
escaped sleeper's status in a draw that tilts ponderously toward
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Like always.
</P>
<P>
   If England, the birthplace of soccer, pulls through with a win
or a tie, 10 European nations will be alive and, of course, kicking
when the second round begins Saturday. Of the major Western powers,
only the doggedly disappointing Spanish team will be conspicuously
absent. A Colombia victory, in turn, would give South America a
fifth entry.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico, a team in dire trouble until virtually the final touch
of the afternoon in Paris' Parc de Princes Stadium, ousted Belgium
and defended our continent's honor, although the U.S. team's
modestly redemptive showing in the inconsequential loss here
against Yugoslavia saved an additional measure of face for us
out-of-the-loop Norte Americanos.
</P>
<P>
   ``El Matador,'' Luis Hernandez, got his bull when he beat the
Dutch goalkeeper in the fifth minute of second-half injury time,
snatching a second consecutive 2-2 tie from the teeth of
you-know-what. The Mexicans had penned the same improbable
0-2-to-2-2 script against the Belgians in their previous game.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, meanwhile, showed up in the quaint old Loire
River port town shattered by the 2-1 defeat to Iran in Lyon on
Sunday night. Many had 6 a.m. flights booked to the United States
today. They couldn't escape coach Steve Sampson or each other
quickly enough. The bickering and blame-placing had become nasty.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. team nearly disgraced
</P>
<P>
   If ever a result appeared destined to be ugly, it was this one,
particularly because the Yugos had the incentive of improving their
second-round draw by overtaking Germany in the Group F standings
with a gob of goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans showed a modicum of pride, though, if little else.
They rewarded their boisterous fans, who turned out in respectable
numbers, bedecked in the obligatory flags and face paint _ one guy
made himself up to be the Statue of Liberty _ with a frantic
defensive effort despite the irrelevancy of the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Sampson's Oh-Fers will leave France having scored
just one goal in 4{-plus hours of competition. When Preki
Radosavljevic's free kick sailed high over the net in the 86th
minute Thursday night, it ensured another shutout.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 32 teams in France, only Tunisia and Japan have
mounted more feeble offensive showings. But both have games today
to try to throw off their goose eggs. The Americans' gander is
cooked, its liver sacrificed to the foie gras trade.
</P>
<P>
   Where the U.S. program goes from here is anyone's guess, but you
suspect that until NBA point guards, NFL cornerbacks and
major-league shortstops are dragged off to a soccer gulag, our
entry shall remain a World Cup nonentity into the foreseeable
future.
</P>
<P>
   But we have Mexico to embrace. They're neighbors, so why not?
</P>
<P>
   Ol!

TOP CBS EXECUTIVES SAID TO FAVOR SECOND WEEKLY `60 MINUTES' 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After months of arm-twisting, key CBS News executives have
overcome their skepticism and agreed to proceed with developing a
second weekly edition of ``60 Minutes,'' the oldest and most
successful news program in television, people close to those
executives said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Don Hewitt, who has been the executive producer of ``60
Minutes'' since he created it 30 years ago, is the crucial person
whose mind has been changed on the subject, said two people who
spoke with him Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt did not return a phone call seeking comment Thursday, but
a staff member said Hewitt was moving ahead with planning the new
program.
</P>
<P>
   No formal announcement has been scheduled, but people inside CBS
headquarters and inside CBS News confirmed that development on the
project's format and staff had begun, and that Hewitt was
supervising the project. The major question of when it would start
remains unresolved, although it is unlikely it could start before a
year from now, these sources said.
</P>
<P>
   None of the five current ``60 Minutes'' correspondents will
participate in the new program, as they told Mel Karmazin, the
president and chief operating officer of CBS, in a meeting June 8.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Hewitt has agreed with the program's correspondents
that a second edition could not be as well produced week in and
week out as the original, Sunday-night program, and that to attempt
to produce a second program would dilute the ``60 Minutes''
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   But Karmazin and Leslie Moonves, the president of CBS Television
who is responsible for entertainment and news programming, both
argued vigorously that a second edition of the popular news program
would help the network's Nielsen ratings, and would also help the
news division compete for attention with ABC News and NBC News,
which have been increasing the number of news magazines they
produce.
</P>
<P>
   NBC, a unit of General Electric Co., has expanded ``Dateline''
to four nights and plans to add a fifth night next season, and Walt
Disney Co.'s ABC has folded ``Prime Time Live'' into ``20/20'' and
will broadcast three nights of that program starting in the fall.
These programs have helped NBC and ABC fill out their schedules
with proven ratings winners on nights when entertainment shows have
not done well.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Tuesday edition of ``Dateline'' was the No.
1-rated show on television, although most entertainment programs
are now in summer reruns.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Heyward, the president of CBS News, has been listening to
both the ``60 Minutes'' objections and the entertainment division's
enthusiasm, trying to negotiate a solution acceptable to both,
people close to him said.
</P>
<P>
   Reached Thursday, Heyward would say only that the idea was
``still under active discussion,'' adding, ``I've asked the people
involved to discuss it inside the shop only and not in the press,
so it behooves me to follow that rule as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Moonves was traveling outside the country Thursday and could not
be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The news of the plans was reported Thursday in The Hollywood
Reporter.
</P>
<P>
   According to people inside CBS News, Jeffrey Fager, the
executive producer of ``Evening News with Dan Rather,'' is the
leading candidate to serve as executive producer of the new
installment of ``60 Minutes,'' and if he accepted the role, Al
Ortiz, CBS News' Washington bureau chief, would replace Fager.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the idea of a second edition was first raised, last
fall, Hewitt has said the key problem would be finding enough
qualified producers capable of crafting the in-depth, substantive
pieces the program is noted for.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that hard to find correspondents, but to find 20 good
producers worth their salt is extremely difficult,'' he said about
six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates for correspondents' roles, people at CBS News said,
include Bob Simon, the network's correspondent in the Middle East,
who already contributes several pieces a year to ``60 Minutes'';
Scott Pelley, CBS' chief White House correspondent, and Jim
Stewart, who covers the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   One person unlikely to join the new program is Bryant Gumbel,
the high-profile former anchor of NBC's ``Today'' show, who joined
CBS a year ago and has been anchoring his own news magazine,
``Public Eye.'' Although it has had mediocre Nielsen ratings,
Heyward has said he is committed to giving Gumbel time to improve
it.
</P>
<P>
   One member of the current ``60 Minutes'' staff, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said the program was being informally
called ``60 Minutes Junior,'' because one idea for it was to use
correspondents in their 30s and 40s who could be trained by Hewitt
and others to succeed the present ``60 Minutes'' correspondents. &QL;

SPECIAL INCENTIVE FOR LEITER AGAINST THE TEAM THAT TRADED HIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also BBO-NY-YANKS-METS)  
 (JT)  
 By JASON DIAMOS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Al Leiter walks out to the mound at Shea Stadium
Friday night in the emotionally charged atmosphere of a house
packed with Mets and Yankee fans, he will be excited as ever.
</P>
<P>
   But not because of some personal vendetta Leiter has against the
Yankees, the team that traded him to the Toronto Blue Jays nine
years ago after a 162-pitch outing in damp weather that Leiter
believes contributed to his ensuing arm trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-year-old left-hander simply gets pumped up every time he
takes the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to stick it to every team I pitch against, not just the
Yankees,'' said Leiter, who will bring an earned-run average of
1.60, the best in the major leagues, into Friday night's opener of
this much-anticipated three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   If this were 1989, or even some time in the early 1990s, Leiter
admitted, he might feel a little differently.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Toms River, N.J., Leiter was touted as the next Ron
Guidry or Dave Righetti when he made his major league debut in
Yankee pinstripes in 1987 as a skinny 21-year-old kid who was prone
to blisters on his pitching hand. Since then, he has been through
so much that he has put behind him that cold spring evening in 1989
when Dallas Green, the Yankee manager then, left him out for 162
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   After one more start as a Yankee, Leiter was dealt to the Blue
Jays for Jesse Barfield. After another start, Leiter began to
develop the arm troubles that derailed his career for the next
three years.
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``I could say, `I shouldn't have stayed in that game. I
should have mentioned something to the pitching coach.' But I
really try to base my life on right now, today. And I think I've
always been that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then Leiter has won three World Series rings: two with the
Blue Jays, one last season with the Florida Marlins, when he
started Game 7 and gave his team a chance to win _ which it did in
extra innings. He has pitched a no-hitter. He has pitched in an
All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   His redemption extends beyond the baseball field, too. Leiter
has also watched his older brother, Mark, recover from the
devastating tragedy of losing an infant son in the spring of 1994
to resurrect his career as the Phillies' current closer at the age
of 35. It was Al Leiter who helped resuscitate his older brother's
career when he persuaded the Yankees to take a look at Mark and
give him his second chance in baseball after Mark, too, had arm
troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``By all rights, he's lucky to be playing,'' said the younger
brother. ``And here he is having a career year.''
</P>
<P>
   They both are. Leiter not only leads the majors in ERA, but he
takes a 9-3 record and a six-game winning streak into Friday
night's game.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Leiter has faced the Yankees nine times in his career.
And he has more than a little mixed emotions about the storied
organization that he began his career with and that he will face
again Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel so far removed from my initial signing with that
team,'' Leiter said. ``It's a bit more of a job to me now. I look
at it like a professional. I don't feel like they dissed me or like
it was any kind of raw deal. If anything, I don't feel like I did
as well as you are supposed to do as a Yankee.''
</P>
<P>
   He dismissed the pressure that will inevitably be present when
he takes the mound against the best team in baseball in such a
highly visible game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm starting a game, Friday night against the Yankees and I'm
going to be as excited as hell,'' he said. ``If there was pressure,
there's no more pressure than to start Game 7 of the World Series.
Here I was, a guy who really didn't have a good year. Our ace
pitched Game 6 and lost. And three-quarters of the media and fans
were thinking we had no chance because I was pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a game in mid-season against a very good team. And
then you bring in what my brother's been through, come on. It's a
baseball game.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiter's future with the Mets is uncertain. Obtained by the Mets
during the Marlins' offseason dismantling, Leiter is in the final
year of a 3-year, $8.6 million contract that will pay him $3
million this season. His representatives, Alan and Randy Hendricks,
are in New York through the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a team really wants a player, don't let him go through the
free agent market,'' Leiter said. He recalled what he told the Blue
Jays: `` `Had you guys come to me in August, I would have signed
with you guys.' I went from a first-time ever free agent making
$900,000 to teams offering me $3 million. I would have signed for
less in August.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Mets, Leiter said: ``I don't know what they're
thinking. I would like for it to work here. You just never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiter has major league pitches, that was never an issue. But
until this season he had never really harnessed his control, not
even in 1996, when he went 16-12 with a 2.93 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   A knee injury dogged Leiter all of last season. But after that
Game 7, when he decided to use other pitches and all of the plate,
Leiter has blossomed into a complete pitcher and not just a
thrower. He will almost certainly be named to his second All-Star
Game in less than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I could think of what could of been,'' said Leiter,
when asked if he ever looks back to the years of arm trouble and
when he sometimes could not find home plate. ``But the two most
wasted emotions are regret and worry. Neither deals with the
present moment.''

BAFFERT CENTER OF SPAT WITH TRACK OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ The popularity of wisecracking trainer Bob Baffert
no longer extends to the Hollywood Park front office, and it's not
because of Silver Charm's withdrawal from Sunday's Hollywood Gold
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   It's because of a spat with track chairman R.D. Hubbard, in
which Baffert showed that even though he's always quotable, he's
not always right.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the month, Baffert entered Silver Charm in the
little-known Stephen Foster Handicap at Churchill Downs, which
raised the purse from $500,000 to $750,000 to attract the 1997
Kentucky Derby winner. Silver Charm was the only ``name' horse in
the field but finished second.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks before that, Hubbard wrote a commentary in the Daily
Racing Form, citing the Foster and its purse bonus as an example of
how tracks put short-term gains ahead of the long-term good of the
sport, luring popular horses to insignificant races in order to
draw a single big crowd instead of forcing would-be champions to
face each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``If racing is ever to establish itself as a major-league
sport,'' Hubbard wrote, ``its stars must compete against each other
in events other than just the Triple Crown and Breeders' Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, Baffert saw little wisdom in what Hubbard wrote. He
fired back in comments to a Los Angeles writer last week, twisting
the knife by saying Hubbard is ``surrounded by people who don't
know racing, and I think he got bad advice. Hollywood Park ought to
spend a few days at Churchill Downs to see how to really run a
track.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert hinted he would not run Real Quiet, the Kentucky Derby
and Preakness winner, in the July 19 Swaps Stakes at Hollywood Park
unless the purse was increased. But Hubbard, admitting his track
has been guilty in the past, isn't playing that game anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's wrong with a track putting up extra money to get the
top horses?'' Baffert was quoted saying. ``It's like anything else,
you have to pay extra to get the best. These horses turn these
tracks into great places again. Look at what Cigar did for little
Suffolk Downs, and then the same thing happened when they got Skip
Away this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert was referring to the Massachusetts Handicap, whose
first-place purse multiplies when the winner is a big-name horse.
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong with that? It produces noncompetitive races that
amount to glorified workouts for horses like Skip Away but not the
showdowns that really matter. The only time purse bonuses make
sense is when they lure two or three big-name horses to the same
race.
</P>
<P>
   More galling: When the horse finishes second in his glorified
workout, and the trainer announces afterward, ``I didn't have
Silver Charm cranked up,'' as Baffert said. The track and the fans
should ask for their money back.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm was withdrawn from the Gold Cup Wednesday after
Baffert said the colt developed a fever. So Baffert didn't attend a
the Gold Cup post-position draw Thursday. Hubbard zinged him
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize we don't know how to run a race track here at
Hollywood Park, but we'll try to put on a good Gold Cup,'' Hubbard
said. ``We're sorry Silver Charm isn't here, but I do believe we
have the best two horses in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away vs. Gentlemen is the kind of matchup fans really want
to see.
</P>
<P>
   __ Eight in Gold Cup: Skip Away and Gentlemen will have to
contend with six other horses, including Californian winner Mud
Route, who wasn't certain to enter; Floriselli, a surprise entrant
for trainer Bobby Frankel, and Budroyale, a former $32,000 claimer
who could press Skip Away on the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away, an even-money favorite, and Gentlemen, 7-5 as part of
an entry with Puerto Madero, will start side by side in posts 2 and
3. Skip Away, trainer Sonny Hine and owner Carolyn Hine arrived
Thursday from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, this is the race of the year,'' Sonny Hine said.
``These are two great horses. Skip Away is the country's best and
Gentlemen is No. 2 _ I've always felt that way.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Jockey change?: Gary Stevens, who had planned to ride in the
East for most of the rest of the year, decided to stay here after
Baffert offered him first call on his horses.
</P>
<P>
   That includes Real Quiet, who has been ridden by Kent
Desormeaux.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Kent, `You'd better start wining and dining Gary,'''
Baffert said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Baffert's comments last week, it appears Real Quiet will
race next in the Swaps.
</P>
<P>
   __ Also this weekend: Marty and Pam Wygod own the favorites in
the two other stakes on the Gold Cup card.
</P>
<P>
   Exotic Wood will go for her 12th victory in 17 starts in the
7-furlong A Gleam Handicap. She and Chris McCarron will face seven
fillies and mares.
</P>
<P>
   Benchmark, winner of the 1[-mile Goodwood Handicap last fall,
returns from ankle-chip surgery for the 7-furlong Triple Bend
Breeders' Cup Handicap. He and Eddie Delahoussaye are lukewarm
favorites in an 11-horse field that includes recent Los Angeles
Handicap winner Gold Land.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's Vanity Invitational Handicap, usually the track's
championship race for fillies and mares, finds Escena shipping in
from Churchill Downs to seek her fourth straight victory for the
Jerry Bailey-Bill Mott-Allen Paulson team. The top local is Fleet
Lady, runnerup in the Milady Handicap, won by I Ain't Bluffing,
who's skipping this one.
</P>
<P>
   __ Elsewhere: In Saturday's Mother Goose, one of the summer's
biggest races for 3-year-old fillies, Frankel-trained Kentucky Oaks
winner Keeper Hill and jockey David Flores lead a well-matched
field of 11.

`WHEN TRUMPETS FADE': A SOLDIER STUCK IN COMBAT AND A TIME WARP 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The years since 1944 intrude too heavily on the attitude and
even the language of ``When Trumpets Fade,'' an otherwise
impressive World War II movie that premieres Saturday on HBO.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the first hint that something is chronologically amiss is
the use of ``Over There,'' a popular World War I song, in the
opening credits. Then comes the film itself, with an emotional
center of gravity that seems to lie somewhere between Korea and
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Director John Irvin (``Hamburger Hill'') and screenwriter W.W.
Vought use the film to convey a sense that battles are bloodily
futile exercises to be survived rather than fought. Then they mix
in the irony _ the god of war applies no rational method to the
grim task of choosing corpses.
</P>
<P>
   These themes aren't unknown to World War II, but they're far
more common to Vietnam or, for that matter, the peculiar horrors in
the Great War of 1914 to 1918.
</P>
<P>
   So Pvt. Manning (Ron Eldard) of the U.S. Army seems a little out
of place in the mud and underbrush of the Hurtgen Forest, bordering
Belgium and Germany, late in 1944. He's a guy who just wants to
keep a low profile and live another day amidst the madness.
</P>
<P>
   Vought's story _ it's fictional, though the Battle of Hurtgen
Forest was a real prelude to the Battle of the Bulge _ has other
things in store for Manning.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its shaky moorings, the movie keeps getting better as
Manning's knack for survival wins him two unwanted promotions, up
to lieutenant, in three days.
</P>
<P>
   Eldard, whose own survival skills got him past ``Men Behaving
Badly,'' is stunningly good as a jaded, battle-hardened soldier who
just wants out but instead finds himself mired deeper and deeper in
what one of his comrades calls ``the death factory.''
</P>
<P>
   Pvt. Manning is essentially a victim of his own competence. His
superiors are forever increasing the odds against him as they
persist in sending him back into the damp forest to face German
tanks and 88 mm guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Trumpets Fade'' re-creates the deadly chaos of pitched
battle as well as, and possibly better than, anything ever produced
for the television screen.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers who adore pyrotechnics in their war movies _ hey, guys!
_ won't feel shortchanged. The tanks, guns and troops, by the way,
are mostly Hungarian. The production was filmed in Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   The film is also unusually suspenseful. When Eldard leads a
patrol of terrified reinforcements into the woods behind the German
line, the dense fog, wind and snapping twigs might catch you with
your eyes wide and your breath short.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're squeamish about foul language, ``When Trumpets
Fade'' could leave you sputtering with rage. There's barely a
phylum or genus of profanity that isn't bandied here.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   _ Which is no way to bring us to Mary Tyler Moore, the host of
``Three Cats From Miami ... and Other Pet Practitioners,'' showing
Sunday on the very same HBO.
</P>
<P>
   Taped in Atlanta, the thing is an unabashedly schmaltzy awards
show for animals. More exactly, for animals that perform some sort
of therapeutic job for their human friends.
</P>
<P>
   Among the winners are Dusty, a rabbit who sits still while
juvenile burn victims pet him; Frosty, a horse used to give rides
to disabled children, and Buster, Flame and Flashback, the three
Miami cats that are regular visitors to a nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   Moore (``In my long career in show business, I've been asked to
do many things, but ...'') appears a tad nervous but comes through
gamely (excuse the word) as she adorns the animals' necks with
ribbons and medals. The barks of approval are from the studio
audience, where dogs lounge in the aisles and occupy several seats.
</P>
<P>
   You could look at it this way: There isn't a single lengthy
acceptance speech, and Harley D. Swine, a potbellied pig, doesn't
squeal, ``You like me! You really like me!''

HOUSE PASSES BILL TO REVAMP TAX COLLECTION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Mo.)   (ja) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By a resounding majority, the House Thursday
approved a compromise bill to revamp the Internal Revenue Service,
moving the country one step closer to the biggest make-over of its
tax collection system in nearly 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Voting 402-8, the House accepted legislation worked out by
House-Senate negotiators that would lead to an internal
reorganization of the IRS, create an independent board to oversee
its operations and give taxpayers more rights and powers in
disputes with the tax agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about putting the taxpayer first and the IRS second,''
said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, who heads the House Ways and Means
Committee. ``It's been the other way around for too long.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected to pass the measure after it returns from
its July Fourth recess. President Clinton has said he will sign it.
</P>
<P>
   Although the measure rolled through the House, there was some
grumbling about a provision tacked on near the end of negotiations
between the House and Senate that gives those who sell stocks or
other property a break on their capital gains taxes. Under that
provision, the time an asset must be held for its profits to
quality for a low, 20 percent tax rate would be reduced to 12
months from the current 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   The change in capital gains taxes was condemned by Rep. Dick
Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that some in the majority in this House can't resist
any opportunity to try to put a tax break in tax legislation for
the wealthiest of the wealthy,'' Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   But though he criticized the new provision on capital gains,
Gephardt, along with virtually all of his Democratic troops, voted
for the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Archer said Thursday that the bill would create 74 new rights
for taxpayers, but some experts say that bill would have minimum
impact on the vast majority of taxpayers who never run afoul of the
IRS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us don't have (a) fight with the IRS,'' Clinton
Stretch of Deloitte &AMP; Touche said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, the burden of proof would shift from the
taxpayer to the government in civil court tax cases as long as the
taxpayer met certain threshold requirements, like maintaining good
records. Another provision would protect ``innocent spouses'' _
generally divorced or separated women _ from being liable for taxes
owed by their former partners. Under the provision, such spouses
would owe taxes only on their portion of the joint income.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also suspend interest and some penalties on
recalcitrant taxpayers if the IRS failed to notify the taxpayer
within 18 months that taxes were owed. Starting in 2004, the IRS
would have to notify the taxpayer within 12 months or it could not
collect interest and penalties.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, if passed by the Senate and signed by Clinton as
expected, would cost the government $13 billion over a 10-year
period as a result of fewer taxes' being collected. Lawmakers said
the loss to the Treasury would be made up by permitting people over
the age of 70{ to shift money from regular individual retirement
accounts into so-called Roth IRAs, which allow for easier
withdrawal, and pay taxes in the process.

 &HT;    Voss sets his sights on Anthony's mark
 &HT;    By Michael Lee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Brian Voss has made a Hall of Fame career out of a
sport typically personified by paunchy men in need of more aerobic
activity.
</P>
<P>
   Voss certainly doesn't fit that description. He has appeared in
a couple of movies, and his striking good looks spawned actress
Lauren Bacall's interest in professional bowling. Chances are,
though, few in Atlanta have ever heard of the guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind that,'' the 39-year-old Roswell resident said.
``I love what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's win.
</P>
<P>
   Voss holds a winning streak that just keeps on rolling, much
like the bowling ball he slings down the lane to knock down 10
pins. He extended his run of one title per year to 12 by claiming
the Professional Bowlers Association Tour's Brunswick Johnny
Petraglia Open in May.
</P>
<P>
   His 12 straight years with at least one title is the best among
active players and ties Don Johnson for second all-time behind PBA
legend Earl Anthony, who won titles in each of his first 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   And you better believe this record means something to Voss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to go in the books. I want people to set themselves to
me,'' said Voss, who has won 19 PBA titles. ``I want to set new
barriers.''
</P>
<P>
   With Voss tip-toeing in on his record, Anthony expressed more
praise than fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish him well. I hope he wins for 25 years in a row_good for
him,'' Anthony said. ``I didn't even know about records. All I did
was bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Voss started bowling when he was six years old. His father,
Dale, bought a bowling center in Anchorage, Alaska, which led to
countless hours of practice and competitions with his four
siblings.
</P>
<P>
   Although his brother Mike tried a career in bowling, Brian was
the one who stuck with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say he was a natural; he worked hard, `` his
mother, Diane Shea, said from her home in Grand Junction, Colo.
``But some people have more of a flair for things than others.''
</P>
<P>
   Professional bowling wasn't always the plan. Voss tried college
for a semester and a half before quitting. After getting fired from
a job at a bowling center and breaking up with his girlfriend, Voss
joined the Army in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after, he was transferred to Germany where word got out
about his prowess in the lanes. He became a member of the all-Army
bowling team and was all-Army champion for two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were the best years of my life,'' said Voss, who
competed throughout Europe.
</P>
<P>
   He left the military in 1981 to start his life as a professional
bowler. Voss claimed his first title in 1983, a sign of things to
come.
</P>
<P>
   Cupid struck in 1987, when Voss met Anderia Gough at a
tournament in Las Vegas. One month later, the streak began with a
victory at the Quaker State Open in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, he moved to Florida to be closer to his future wife.
That was also the year he was named PBA player of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Voss' exchanged vows the day after one of Brian's biggest
victories, the Budweiser Classic in Sunrise, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Voss is the first to admit it doesn't come as easy anymore,
however.
</P>
<P>
   Before claiming that title in May, Voss went through one of the
biggest slumps of his career. For four weeks, he barely missed
cuts, and he felt he was just throwing away the $1,200 a week it
costs him to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel the same as I did. I need to practice more,''
said Voss, who was inducted into the PBA Hall of Fame in 1994.
``Things have changed a lot. I didn't have a wife and kids. If I
wasn't out partying, chasing girls or whatever, I was practicing.''
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, Voss got a scare when he thought his
seven-year-old son, Joshua, didn't come home from school. He later
found out that Joshua hid under the bed because he got in trouble
at school.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's part of being a parent, I guess,'' said Voss, who also
has a six-year-old son,Cameron. ``I wish I could be with them all
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   But he knows that only comes when the tour stops for its annual
three-month break.Although his earnings surpassed $1 million in
1992, Voss realizes that continued success edges him closer to the
record and a more comfortable future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it's like to have a real job,'' Voss said.
``I'm doing this until they stop making Advil.''

   ATLANTA -- The qualities that made it the host city for the '96
Olympics continued to pay off Thursday, when the NCAA Men's
Basketball Committee awarded the 2007 Final Four to Atlanta and the
Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Also receiving Final Fours on Thursday were New Orleans (2003),
San Antonio (2004), St. Louis (2005), and Indianapolis (2006).
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA originally had planned to award only three Final Fours,
with five cities competing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But all the bids were so impressive that it would have been
difficult to get it down to three,'' said Kentucky athletics
director C.M. Newton, committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta already has the 2002 Final Four. The only other Final
Four here was in 1977 at the Omni.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are absolutely thrilled,'' said Charlie Shaffer, president
of the Atlanta Sports Council, which put Atlanta's bid together.
``There were a lot of good things about our bid, but more than
anything, the city of Atlanta won it for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's bid for the Final Four was presented to the NCAA on
Monday by Shaffer; Dave Braine, the athletics director of Georgia
Tech, the host school; and Kahlil Johnson of the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Some highlights of Atlanta's bid:
</P>
<P>
   Transportation: Eighty-three percent of the nation's population
can reach Atlanta by plane in two hours or less. Over 2000 flights
leave Atlanta each day, more than from any competing city.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels: The NCAA wanted a minimum guarantee of 8,000 hotel
rooms. Atlanta offered 8,400 within 10 minutes of the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Centennial Park: The Olympic park will serve as the major
gathering and recreation area for the 40,000-plus fans that will
attend each session of the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you looked at the bid and the history Atlanta has of
hosting these kind of events, it was really a no-brainer,'' Newton
said.
</P>
<P>
   After making improvements to the Superdome, New Orleans will be
getting its first Final Four since 1993. San Antonio drew rave
reviews after hosting the event this March and was rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis built the TransWorld Dome and will get its first Final
Four since 1978. Indianapolis, which had the Final Four in 1997,
will get it again in 2000 and 2002.

 &HT;    Hawks center indicted for drugs
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Atlanta Hawks backup center Greg ``Cadillac''
Anderson has been indicted by a federal grand jury in Jackson,
Miss., on drug and money-laundering charges.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was accused of two counts of possession of cocaine with
intent to distribute and one count of money laundering, according
to U.S. Attorney Brad Pigott. Authorities refused to say whether
Anderson was in custody or was being sought by FBI agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am shocked,'' Hawks general manager Pete Babcock said
Thursday night. ``Absolutely shocked. For his sake, I hope it's not
true. If it is, it's a huge disappointment. It's a tremendous
disappointment that there is even the accusation.''
</P>
<P>
   Babcock said he was first apprised of the situation by an FBI
agent during Wednesday's NBA Draft. The agent granted Babcock a
``courtesy'' and revealed that Anderson was the alleged culprit.
</P>
<P>
   But because the indictment was sealed, Babcock would not reveal
Anderson's name early Thursday after a press conference introducing
first-round draft choice Roshown McLeod.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in Jackson, Miss., also refused to comment until a
federal judge agreed late Thursday to unseal that part of the
indictment identifying Anderson and the charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   With the bulk of the indictment remaining under seal, officials
refused to say if others had been charged by the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA has been hit by player arrests for drug possessions, but
nothing on this level.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it turns out that he is guilty,'' Babcock said, ``he has
absolutely no place in our organization whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, a 6-foot-10, 250-pound free agent, has played for five
NBA teams. He has career averages of 7.3 points and 6.2 rebounds a
game. Last season with the Hawks, he played in 50 games, averaging
1.8 points and 2.4 rebounds.

 &HT;    PBA going back to raucous roots
 &HT;    By Michael Lee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- During the Professional Bowling Association tour's
36-year run on ABC, professional bowlers approaching their pins
were like doctors in the operating room _ the slightest
out-of-place sound wasn't tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   No more.
</P>
<P>
   Since moving to CBS this year, the tour, which ranks behind only
college football as the longest-running sports series on network
television, has taken on a completely new ``Generation X'' look,
full of state-of-the-art graphics and a loud, raucous atmosphere
reminiscent of most bowling alleys.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look at sports, I want to be entertained,'' PBA
commissioner Mark Gerberich said. ``In the days of the remote
control, we need to put more energy in the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   To do just that, the new format includes a ``mini-arena'' set-up
in which fans are seated in a horseshoe arrangement to surround the
bowlers, permitted to cheer at all times _ even when a player
prepares to make a delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our players were being unfairly criticized as being
primadonnas, where they need quiet,'' Gerberich said. ``Bowling's
supposed to be fun. Our players perform in noise all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The PBA experimented with the format last season on ESPN, where
the tour is still televised, and Tom Baker likes the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been so excited,'' said Baker, who has bowled
professionally for 22 years. ``The people get your heart racing. It
was a little too quiet. Now, players show a lot more emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Other changes to the telecasts include a super-slow-motion
camera to capture pin action and ball spinning and a moving camera
that follows the ball down the lane.
</P>
<P>
   Championship rounds feature gold-colored Pro-Pins that are four
ounces heavier than the standard pins. Also, with airtime cut from
90 minutes to one hour, the five-man step-ladder tournament has
been reduced to four. Although there has been a 15 percent increase
in ratings on ESPN, the audience on CBS has dropped slightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my hometown of Buffalo, they don't like the format,'' Baker
said. ``For me, it doesn't make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to knock down pins.

 &HT;    New owners to revamp RuckusText
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The new owners of the Atlanta Ruckus _ the fourth
group of people to hold that title in as many years _ are using an
adage familiar to local soccer fans as they pledge to reverse a
pattern of neglect by their predecessors:
</P>
<P>
   Trust us.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney John Latham and banking executive Robert Glustrom have
been in charge for less than a week, but their first act was to
alter the team's identity. For the time being, the Ruckus will be
referred to only as ``A-League Atlanta'' until a new nickname is
unveiled, probably by the start of next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ruckus just doesn't have positive connotations,'' said
Glustrom, chairman of AmTrade International Bank in Atlanta and the
father of three soccer-playing sons. ``We want to develop an image
and a brand and decide what we're going to stand for.''
</P>
<P>
   So tonight in Richmond, Va., the team formerly known as the
Ruckus (2-10) plays its first game since the A-League revoked the
franchise rights of former owner Vincent Lu last week for failing
to abide by operational guidelines. Head coach David Eristavi has
been retained, and several current players are being approached
about staying on.
</P>
<P>
   Latham, a partner in the prominent Atlanta law firm of Alston
and Bird and counsel to soccer apparel maker Umbro, the A-League's
main sponsor, said he and Glustrom, a longtime personal friend,
didn't have to be persuaded to step in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thrilled to be in this position,'' Latham said. ``Bobby
and I had been talking about doing this if the opportunity came
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Atlanta Chiefs player Mike Balson, an A-League
consultant, will serve as general manager for the rest of the
season and will help implement a long-term business plan.
</P>
<P>
   Lu refused to promote and market the team and failed to pay
employees and work with sponsors as well as the league. Attendance
has plummeted from an average of 2,406 last year to barely 500 a
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at the last home game (a 2-0 loss to Richmond on June
9), and I counted only 126 heads,'' Glustrom said. ``I almos
cried.''
</P>
<P>
   The franchise nearly folded in June 1996 when Lu, who owns a
tennis racquet business, promised to turn it around and move home
games to property he owns on the old Roswell High School site.
</P>
<P>
   But Lu's interest diminished rapidly. A week before the current
season began, he switched home games to Adams Stadium after feuding
with the city of Roswell on several legal and financial issues. On
June 13, he refused to send a team to a road game on Long Island,
prompting the league to act.

   BBDO FORMS VENTURE WITH JAPANESE PARTNER
</P>
<P>
   BBDO Worldwide in New York and I&AMP;S Corp. in Tokyo said Thursday
that they would form a partnership in Japan, formalizing a
relationship that began in April when Omnicom Group, the parent of
BBDO, acquired a 20 percent interest in I&AMP;S.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Rosenshine, chairman and chief executive of BBDO, said the
deal marked the first time that a top-10 Japanese agency had
entered into an equity agreement with a Western agency in which
operations would be merged rather than held in a separate joint
venture. As BBDO begins its relationship with I&AMP;S, he added, the
agency would end, after 14 years, an association with Asatsu Inc.
in Tokyo for the Japanese market.
</P>
<P>
   I&AMP;S ranks eighth among Japanese agencies, with billings
estimated at $912 million from clients including Kao and Shiseido.
BBDO serves clients in Japan including Bayer AG and Pepsico Inc.,
which are expected to be shifted to the new partnership.

 &HT;    Galarraga gets extra day to heal
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- What a strained groin could not do, what a crushed
little finger could not achieve, a wrenched back has done to Andres
Galarraga. The first baseman hopes to be back in the lineup tonight
for the start of the Toronto series after missing his first two
starts as a Braves. Look quick. Since re-establishing his career,
Galarraga does not sit down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big improvement from yesterday,'' he said Thursday. ``I don't
want to play like this. I'd rather not play today and play and then
miss two weeks. If I keep getting better like I have, in a few days
it will be all better probably.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Galarraga missed eight games _ three while serving a
suspension for charging the mound, four after breaking a bone in
his right hand when hit by a pitch. When he came back, he went on a
nine-game hitting streak. He missed just three starts in all of
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Cox believed. He had two lineups posted on the
clubhouse wall _ one with Galarraga, the other with Javy Lopez
batting clean-up. But after a day of whirlpool, heat and
ultra-sound therapy, Galarraga skipped batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He plays hurt all the time,'' said Cox. ``He played with that
bad finger (after being hit by a pitch June 13 by Montreal's Jesus
Vazquez). It's already been broken once. And he's still soaking it
every day in the whirlpool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he played through his groin injury, when he could barely
walk. And he was still hitting like crazy. Now, he could run pretty
good so he played through both of those. This thing, a back injury,
you can forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga felt a twinge in the left side of his lower back while
taking batting practice at Yankee Stadium Tuesday night and thought
nothing of it, until he tried to get out of bed the next day. ``I
couldn't even put on my clothes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga had gone hitless in eight at-bats in New York while
his average dropped to .306, the lowest in eight weeks. He has not
hit a home run in his last 11 starts, his longest stretch of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss scare
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Walt Weiss and wife Terri had a scare Thursday when
Bo, the couple's 11-month-old son, began running a fever and was
taken to Scottish Rite Children's Hospital for examinatin. Like
Brody, the couple's 3-year-old who is fighting a serious E. coli
infection, Bo had tested positive for the bacteria, but not for the
same strain that has infected his brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's clear so far,'' Weiss said. ``We got nervous when he ran
a temperature. We'll keep an eye on him for another two days and if
he's still clear, then he'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss reported Brody was unchanged, ``which is good. He's at the
stage right now where things can change quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Oz-man walking
</P>
<P>
   With 11 walks in his first 85 at-bats as a Brave, Ozzie Guillen
has already surpassed his season total of 10 from 1996, when he
batted 499 times. At this rate, he could surpass his career high
(28 in 1990) by the end of July. The transformation _ prompted by
Guillen's leadoff role and adapting to a new league _ has been
radical. In his 13 seasons with the White Sox, Guillen walked an
average of once every 31.4 at-bats. As a Brave, that rate is 7.7
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a free swinger,'' he insists. ``But I'm going up there to
have a good at-bat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ozzie's smart,'' said Cox. ``He knows situations and he can
have real good at-bats with men on. No easy out with him. I never
like to see a guy like that come up with men on. They're not going
to hit a home run but they'll get wood on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Pride could not have played in the field if he had to
Thursday, after taking a David Cone fastball to the right kneecap
the night before. ... Dugout coach Jim Beauchamp is back in the
clubhouse after surgery to repair tendon damage in his right knee.
He faces some extensive rehab time before being able to resume his
regular duties. ... Stat corner: Kevin Millwood went to 3-2 counts
to nine of the first 11 men he faced Wednesday night en route to a
93-pitch count in just 3 1/3 innings. ``That's not his game,'' said
Cox. ``His game is get 'em out quick.''

<P>
   Quickly: The Blue Jays attempted Thursday night to sweep four
games from Canadian rival Montreal. The team is still trying to
recover from one of its worst starts in history in a record-tying
16-loss April. The Blue Jays came within one victory of tying the
franchise record for May wins with 18 and were 10-10 in their last
20 games entering Thursday night. ... Canseco has stunned the
league by reclaiming his career at age 33. He has reached the 20-20
mark for the third time in his career and continues to pace the
club offensively, even though he has hit just .207 over the past 10
days.Who's hot: Catcher Darrin Fletcher, who came off the DL June
14 after a hamstring problem, has hit .400 since with seven RBIs in
35 at-bats. DH Mike Stanley had a six-game hitting streak and was
batting .426 with five homers in his previous 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   Who's not: Canseco, despite strong production numbers, is
hitting .207 over his last 10 games. Veteran Juan Samuel is hitting
just .200 in a reserve role.

PANEL RECOMMENDS COMMUTING A DEATH SENTENCE
</HEADLINE>
   (ja)

<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Texas State Board of Pardons and Paroles
recommended Thursday that one of the United States' most notorious
mass murderers not be executed for a killing that evidence suggests
he did not commit.
</P>
<P>
   It is now up to Gov. George W. Bush to decide whether the
killer, Henry Lee Lucas, should have his death sentence commuted to
life in prison, as the board suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an unusual case,'' Bush said after the ruling. ``I
will give it careful consideration and announce a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas is also serving six life terms, two 75-year terms, and one
60-year term for nine other killings, but the case for which he was
sentenced to death, the rape and murder of a hitchhiker 19 years
ago, is the only one in which there is serious doubt about his
guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas, 61, was scheduled to be executed by lethal injection at
6:01 p.m. on June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas' lawyers said they expected the governor to honor the
board's recommendation, since he had publicly asked the board to
review the case. But, one lawyer added, it would be the first time
Bush has commuted a death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas, who in the 1980s asserted that he had committed as many
as 600 murders across the country, told officials that the
unidentified slain woman, known only as Orange Socks, was one of
his victims. But he later recanted his confessions and work records
and other evidence now suggest that he was in Florida at the time
of the killing in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The case came to the public's attention after former state
Attorney General Jim Mattox, a supporter of the death penalty,
reviewed Lucas' case and concluded that there was compelling
evidence he was not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the state that easily leads the nation in executions,
Lucas' lawyer Danny Burns said he had not expected the board to
give his client a reprieve. It is the first time the Texas board
has, without a court decision, recommended the commutation of a
death sentence since 1976, when the death penalty was reinstated,
Burns said.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Rodriguez, chairman of the parole board, said he could
not confirm that but added, ``I know it is the first in recent
times.''
</P>
<P>
   Rita Radostitz, another lawyer for Lucas, said he was, ``very
emotional'' when told of the board's recommendation. ``He was
definitely pleased, relieved I think.''
</P>
<P>
   The board did not call for overturning Lucas' conviction. In a
letter to Bush, Rodriguez said, ``It is important to note that this
person remains convicted of this offense and as such should remain
incarcerated for the rest of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether the board's recommendation meant that it had
decided there were reasons to doubt Lucas' guilt, Rodriguez said:
``I felt that he had raised enough questions. When you're deciding
life and death, enough questions is enough.''

CAMBY WILL HAVE TO EARN KNICKS' SUPPORT ON THE COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first hurdle Marcus Camby faces in New York will probably be
in his own locker room. The former University of Massachusetts star
was traded from the Raptors to the Knicks Thursday for Charles
Oakley, one of the most popular players in team history. Oakley's
teammates won't be thrilled about the deal. But one thing can
change their opinions: Camby on the court.
</P>
<P>
   While New York may have lost a layer of toughness by trading the
34-year-old Oakley _ a Knick since 1988 _ it acquired a man 10
years younger who led the NBA in blocked shots (3.65 per game) last
season. So now the Knicks can have two 7-foot shot-blockers in
their frontcourt, Camby and Patrick Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives us more flexibility, makes us more intimidating in
the defensive end and more athletic than we've been in the past,''
general manager Ernie Grunfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   It also helps bankroll the cash-strapped Raptors. In addition to
Oakley, they received second-round draft pick Sean Marks and cash.
Part of the money undoubtedly is to help fund the $10 million
balloon payment Oakley is due at the end of next season. The
Raptors also received cash from the Warriors when they traded
Antawn Jamison to them for guard Vince Carter. The team that was
once seen as a young group on the way up after drafting Camby
second overall in 1996 now boasts a strange mix of youth and
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley is 34. Kevin Willis, acquired earlier this month, is 35.
Chauncey Billups, Carter, and Alvin Williams are all 22 or under.
</P>
<P>
   ``As one of the NBA's best defenders and rebounders, Charles
Oakley gives us a physical presence and mental toughness that is
unsurpassed in our league,'' Raptors GM Glen Grunwald said.
</P>
<P>
   Camby had been either injured or out of place in Toronto. Most
observers agree that he has only scratched his potential. Still, he
had decent numbers with 12.1 points and 7.4 rebounds per game last
season. The flip side is that he has missed a total of 38 games in
two pro seasons. The Knicks will miss Oakley's durability and
hustle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have tremendous respect for Charles and what he has meant
to the franchise,'' Grunfeld said. ``It was a difficult thing to do
because of what he has meant to the franchise. You have very strong
feelings. We grew up together and we've been through a lot of
battles together. It's never easy to part with someone of his
character.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakley's fan base at Madison Square Garden was diverse because
all could relate to the gritty play that often led to hard fouls
and discipline by the NBA. Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy often
defended the aggressiveness of Oakley. Thursday the coach joked
about the man who will be an opponent. ``I want to make it clear,''
he said, ``Charles Oakley does flagrantly foul now.''

AMEX MEMBERS VOTE TO JOIN NASD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The American Stock Exchange, one of the nation's
oldest and sleepiest financial exchanges, said Thursday that its
members had voted overwhelmingly to join the the parent
organization of the Nasdaq stock market, the fast-growing exchange
that favors high-technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   More than two-thirds of the 828 members of the American Stock
Exchange, which includes floor brokers, specialists and others who
operate on the trading floor, voted for the merger, intended to
create a vastly more competitive rival to the New York Stock
Exchange, which has long been the nation's preeminent marketplace
for buying and selling stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq stock market, the nation's second largest stock
exchange, and the American Stock Exchange, the third largest, will
continue to operate as separate entities. While the Amex offers the
traditional ``open outcry'' market, the Nasdaq is an electronic
exchange where all the trading is done by telephone and computer
links. But by combining, the Amex is expected to get a new
technology platform to enhance its trading floor.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, by sharing technology and regulatory resources and
offering companies around the world a choice of listing on an
electronic exchange or one that operates as an open-air auction
market, where brokers shout out bids and offers on stocks, the
National Association of Securities Dealers, which will oversee both
exchanges, hopes to create a cheaper and more efficient global
``market of markets'' that might some day overtake the Big Board as
the world's leading marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   The promise to investors, big and small, is the prospect of
lower trading costs for the thousands of stocks listed on the two
exchanges, everything from MCI Communications and Starbucks Coffee,
which trade on the Nasdaq, to Viacom and Cablevision, which are
listed on the American Stock Exchange. The combination could allow
the two exchanges to lure companies with more global heft.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the agreement, which still must be approved by the
Securities and Exchange Commission, the NASD, Nasdaq's parent, said
it would commit at least $110 million to the Amex over the next
five years, to upgrade its technology, and spend an additional $30
million on marketing and advertising for both exchanges.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The vote, 622-206, more than the two-thirds majority required,
was a huge victory for NASD chairman Frank Zarb and Amex chairman
Richard Syron.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the results of the vote, Syron said in a telephone
conference call that there was little dissent before the vote. ``It
was a very orderly, very calm meeting,'' he said. ``This really is
an overwhelming vote in favor.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some members had been expected to oppose the merger
Thursday night over concerns that seat prices would decline and
that the traditional auction market would be changed, those who
attended the meeting said that many of those issues had been
addressed by the NASD and Amex leaders, who traveled the country,
lobbying for a merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once people had a stake in the negotiating process, once they
were participating in it, then they became comfortable with the
transaction and were willing to support it,'' said Lewis Lowenfels,
a former member of the board of governors of the Amex who
represented the floor brokers in the merger.
</P>
<P>
   While the Nasdaq has managed to surpass the Big Board in daily
trading volume in recent years, it continues to lose companies to
the more established exchange. And a series of investigations into
improper trading practices surrounding Nasdaq companies in the
1980s and 1990s sullied the electronic market's reputation. More
than 30 Wall Street firms agreed in December to pay about $1
billion to settle price-fixing charges that they kept the spreads
on trades artificially wide. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Amex, on the other hand, has suffered less from scandal than
from a diminishing position relative to the high profile Big Board.
The junior exchange fell to third place behind the Nasdaq in
listings and trading volume in the 1970s, and managed to stay just
ahead of the smaller regional exchanges in the 1980s and 1990s. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, though, the Amex has developed a strong
business in options and other derivatives, particularly those that
track the fortunes of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, known as
Spiders, and the Dow Jones industrial average, or Diamonds. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet just as the Nasdaq seemed to be losing momentum, and the
Amex seemed to be losing hope of ever being a market leader, the
boards of the two exchanges agreed last April to a merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great boon for companies listed on the American
Stock Exchange because it was a back-water, a no place,'' said
Samuel Hayes, a professor at Harvard University, after the merger
proposal was announced in March. ``This also gives the Nasdaq a
platform for higher visibility vis-a-vis the New York Stock
Exchange.''
</P>
<P>
   The combination also helped lure the Philadelphia Stock
Exchange, the nation's oldest exchange and one that is rich in
stock and options listings, into the merger talks.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Stock Exchange, meanwhile, has been making great
strides in the listing of large international companies, and
basking in the glow of record revenue and trading.
</P>
<P>
   But few on Wall Street are expecting anything less than an
all-out brawl between the exchanges. And with the vote over, Zarb
said, ``Now it's time to forge a single front.''

1 IN 8 BOYS OF HIGH-SCHOOL AGE HAS BEEN ABUSED, SURVEY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TAMAR LEWIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new study of adolescent boys' health has found that more than
one in eight high-school-age boys said they had been physically or
sexually abused, with Hispanic and Asian-American boys reporting
the highest rates of both kinds of abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were surprised by these differences between ethnic
groups,'' said Cathy Schoen, an author of the study. ``We didn't
find those ethnic differences when we looked at abuse among girls,
and most of the studies of abuse look at girls, because they have a
much higher rate of sexual abuse. But boys and girls have similar
rates of physical abuse, and it does look like boys within some
ethnic families are more at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted by Louis Harris and Associates Inc. for The
Commonwealth Fund, found that the physical abuse of boys was far
more common than sexual abuse, and that two-thirds of the physical
abuse was by a family member and took place in the home.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who were sexually abused, about one-third reported
that the abuse had happened at home, and 45 percent said the abuser
was a family member. Most of the boys said the sexual or physical
abuse they experienced was a recurring pattern.
</P>
<P>
   The study, based on questionnaires completed by 3,162 boys in
grades five to 12 in nearly 300 schools across the country,
compared the boys' responses with those collected in a matching
sample of adolescent girls, analyzed in a report last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Almost half the abused boys said they had not talked to anyone
about it, compared with 29 percent of the abused girls. And among
the boys, abuse was more strongly linked to thoughts of suicide: 15
percent of the abused boys said they wanted to kill themselves,
nearly double the rate of the abused girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's striking how many boys have no one to talk to, and keep
their problems to themselves,'' Ms. Schoen said. ``Another thing
that struck me about boys who said they had been abused is their
much higher rate of bulimia, which is so rare among boys generally
that doctors could almost look at it as an early warning sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, boys were more likely than girls to say that they did
not usually talk to anyone when they were stressed, overwhelmed or
depressed. Boys with symptoms of poor mental health were
particularly likely to lack a support person.
</P>
<P>
   Four in 10 of the boys with severe symptoms of depression had no
one to talk with, more than twice the ratio of the girls. Among
boys and girls alike, mothers were the most frequently named source
of support.
</P>
<P>
   The questionnaires did not define abuse, asking simply whether
the respondent had ever been sexually or physically abused. Among
Asian-American boys, 9 percent reported sexual abuse and 17 percent
reported physical abuse. Among Hispanic boys, 7 percent said they
had been sexually abused and 13 percent said they had been
physically abused. Among blacks and whites, the sexual abuse rate
was 3 percent; 10 percent of the blacks and 8 percent of the whites
said they had been physically abused.
</P>
<P>
   While three-quarters of boys and girls alike said they turned to
television when they were stressed, girls were far more likely than
boys to say they would call a friend, while boys were more likely
to spend time on the computer or exercising.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was conducted from December 1996 through June 1997
and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three
percentage points for the boys overall; the percentage was higher
for the individual ethnic groups.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The survey examined several areas of boys' health:
</P>
<P>
   _ Eight in 10 boys exercised at least three times a week, but
Hispanic and Asian-American boys were less likely than black or
white boys to participate in organized sports.
</P>
<P>
   _ While boys were generally much less likely than girls to
report eating disorders _ 8 percent of the boys said they had
binged or purged, compared to 16 percent of the girls _ abused boys
were four times more likely to have binged or purged than those who
had not been abused, and eight times as likely to do so frequently.
</P>
<P>
   _ While high school boys and girls had similar rates of
drinking, smoking and using drugs, boys in grades five thorough
eight were more likely than girls to drink, smoke or use drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, one in five adolescent boys said there had been a
time when he needed medical care but did not get it, and uninsured
or abused boys were especially likely to have been in that
situation.

THE UNTOLD STORY OF THE CELTICS DRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Every NBA draft has millions of untold stories tucked
in its corners. Here are 10 from the 1998 edition Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
   _Certainly, the Celtics are happy with their selection of Paul
Pierce in the No. 10 slot. As general manager Chris Wallace said,
``When it came to our draft board, we didn't have Pierce in our
state, let alone our neighborhood.'' But many in the organization
are still wondering, ``What if?'' as in ``What if Dirk Nowitzki had
not been taken before Boston picked?''
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that the Celtics have dreamed of the 6-foot-11-inch
Nowitzki for the past month. Their talk that they wouldn't be able
to sign him because of international concerns was a smoke screen to
scare off other teams. Some teams bought it; Don Nelson didn't.
Rick Pitino and his staff were so confident that they could get
Nowitzki that early during the draft, Celtic representatives were
on the phone speaking with the 20-year-old center. Nowitzki was
telling them how excited he was with the idea of playing in Boston.
And then former Celtic Nelson, coach and general manager of the
Mavericks, swooped in and made a deal with the Bucks.
</P>
<P>
   That left the Celtics thinking about two additional
could-have-beens: They had a chance to swap picks with Milwaukee
(the Bucks wanted the Celtics to take center Andrew Lang off their
hands, too). If the Celtics had done that, Nelson couldn't have
gotten their man from them. Also, think of early May. The Celtics
and Bucks, with identical records, had a coin toss to see who would
get additional Ping-Pong balls in the lottery. The Celtics lost. As
a result, the Bucks picked ninth and the Celtics 10th.
</P>
<P>
   _Antoine Walker was in Vancouver, British Columbia, site of the
draft, giving advice to his friend Nazr Mohammed. Walker wanted the
Celtics to draft the center from Kentucky, so much so that there
was a call to the Celtic offices Wednesday afternoon. It was
superagent David Falk, who represents Walker. His question: What
about Nazr? The Celtics said they weren't going to take him (word
is that they weren't thrilled when Utah's Michael Doleac checked
out faster than Mohammed in a running drill). Falk relayed that
Walker would find the news very disappointing. Eventually, Mohammed
was taken by the Jazz and traded to the 76ers.
</P>
<P>
   _Two Celtics watching the draft closely were Tyus Edney and
Bruce Bowen. The Celtics have to exercise a contract option on both
players by Tuesday. If the team picks up their contracts, they
stay. If the team doesn't, they become free agents. Edney has
bulked up this summer, surprising all who have seen him. But the
Celtics will probably add his comparatively meager salary (about
$500,000) to their free agent savings account and re-sign defensive
ace Bowen.
</P>
<P>
   _Pitino said Walker was not discussed in any deals. Two Western
Conference teams, however, insist that the Celtics dangled their
6-9 captain in an effort to move up. Word out of Los Angeles is
that there was a Walker-for-Michael Olowokandi proposal (the No. 10
pick was not involved), which the Clippers seemed interested in
until ... well, until Falk had a meeting with the Clippers Monday
afternoon. The agent was speaking on behalf of Mike Bibby, but
don't think for a second that Walker's name didn't come up. The
Clippers wound up taking Olowokandi with the first pick.
</P>
<P>
   _When Ron Mercer left Kentucky, he said he had his best workout
with Denver and thought the Nuggets would draft him. Obviously,
they didn't. But there was a chance Mercer could have gone to the
Nuggets Wednesday. Or the Grizzlies. The Celtics had proposals with
both teams that didn't go through. But a consolation prize could
come in the next few days, if they are interested. The Cavaliers
were apparently interested in trading with the Grizzlies. Their
target at the No. 2 spot: Pierce. They were willing to trade Wesley
Person, a career 40 percent shooter from 3-point range, and others.
If the Celtics did want to move Pierce, they know one of their
first calls could be to Cleveland's 216 area code.
</P>
<P>
   _Hey, M.L. Carr. If your nemesis, Peter Vecsey, hasn't called in
a while, it's not because he has lost your phone number. The NBC-TV
and New York Post journalist called the Celtics' war room with the
news that the Bucks were going to take Nowitzki for the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   _Boston wasn't the only team affected by the Kings taking Jason
Williams with the seventh pick. The Magic were also thrown by the
pick. In their perfect world, they were planning to take Williams
with one of their three first-rounders. Orlando also received calls
from Boston. The Celtics fell in love with Keon Clark after the
6-11 center's workout at Brandeis a week ago. ``You would have paid
to see it,'' Wallace said. ``If this guy didn't have the background
questions, there's no way he would have been there at 10 or 12.''
</P>
<P>
   _Travis Knight was close to packing his bags and moving out of
his Cambridge, Mass. home. The Lakers and Jazz had some interest in
the 7-footer.
</P>
<P>
   _The Celtics like to keep up with the neighbors. So you know
they are interested in the 76ers' activity. Not only did
Philadelphia get better by drafting Larry Hughes and trading for
Mohammed, the Sixers _ according to sources _ plan to waive Derrick
Coleman next week (it will cost them $5 million). After that, word
is that the 6-10 power forward will sign with the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   _It doesn't matter who you are. Lawyer, doctor, student,
diplomat, scholar, artist, musician. You have a better chance of
slipping on a Celtics uniform in 1998-99 than Dontae Jones. The
forward continues to accumulate fines at a startling rate. While
with the Knicks, his fine tab had reached a record $80,000 for the
season. The talented guard has already blown off several workout
sessions this summer.

INTEL CONFIRMS FLAW IN NEW CHIP
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Intel Corp. confirmed Thursday that a bug would
delay shipments of its 450NX chip set, which is to be used with its
new Xeon microprocessor in high-powered servers.
</P>
<P>
   Xeon will sell for $1,100 to $2,800, depending on the level of
memory included with the chip. The Xeon is Intel's first entry into
the area of high-performance computing, which has been dominated by
chips like Sun Microsystems' Sparc, Hewlett-Packard Co.'s PA-RISC
and Silicon Graphics' MIPS.
</P>
<P>
   Intel said the flaw only affected the Xeon when it is used with
the 450NX chip set, the set of parts surrounding the
microprocessor, which is intended for large servers using up to
four processors at a time. Further testing will delay shipment of
that combination by about three weeks, Robert Minetta, an Intel
spokesman, said. There is no problem when Xeon is used with the
440GX chip set, which will commonly be used in work stations and
smaller servers, he added.

   Intel did not disclose the nature of the flaw in the 450NX, but
Minetta said it would be published shortly. Such problems are
common in new microprocessors and are usually of little consequence
to most users. But Intel's experience with the original Pentium in
1994, when it denied the significance of a flaw, only to later
issue a recall of thousands of chips, has prompted the company to
disclose such problems as they become known.

<P>
   The American Society of Newspaper Editors has rescinded the 1998
Distinguished Writing Award it gave to former Boston Globe
columnist Patricia Smith, citing her admitted fabrication of people
and quotations in four columns.
</P>
<P>
   Although none of Smith's 1997 columns submitted for the award
contained fabrications, the society board said in a statement
Thursday, ``There is no place in journalism for fabrication of any
kind.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time the society withdrew an award since it
instituted the prizes in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Smith did not return a call to her home Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Globe editor Matthew V. Storin had urged the society
Wednesday to withdraw the award.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 43, resigned from the paper June 18 after admitting that
she had invented characters and quotes. Before her resignation, she
had written a Metro column twice a week since 1994.

   BEIJING _ Mao Tse-Tung's ghostly portrait beamed down on
Tiananmen Square as China prepared an ear-splitting 21-gun salute
Saturday for the American president Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton began his China tour with robed dancers and
heart-thudding drumbeats at China's old imperial capital of Xi'an
on Thursday night, but the events on Saturday at Beijing's infamous
downtown square will be the centerpiece of his nine-day visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If China will cooperate with America, then nobody can defeat
China,'' said Wei Wenqing, 86, on the day President Clinton became
the first U.S. leader in a decade to land on Chinese soil. The
gnarled pensioner was out for an afternoon walk on the exact spot
where Clinton is due to receive the ceremonial Tiananmen Square
greeting that the U.S. House of Representatives urged the president
to refuse.
</P>
<P>
   Workers could be seen polishing the brass doors of the Great
Hall of the People. This massive parliament building, which
resembles an over-grown Soviet-built subway station, will be the
television backdrop as Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin
stride down a formation of People's Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers
on the western edge of the world's biggest public square.
</P>
<P>
   If China's past practice is followed, the troops Clinton reviews
will be carrying highly polished fixed bayonets.
</P>
<P>
   Following the 15-minute outdoor ceremony, Clinton and the
71-year-old Jiang are due to mount a set of stone steps leading
into the Great Hall of the People for the first session of their
Beijing summit conference.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-gun salute Clinton will receive is an honor that China
reserves for a rarefied group of foreign leaders it regards as
especially worth cultivating. In this decade they have included
Japanese Emperor Akihito in 1992, King Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia
in 1994, Russian President Boris Yeltsin in 1997 and Bulgarian
President Petur Stoyanov last month.
</P>
<P>
   Except for hauling in some extra flower pots, the Chinese seemed
to be making no effort to prettify the square that to many in
America symbolizes the Chinese Communist Party's cold-blooded
suppression of the 1989 student-led pro-democracy movement.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, along one of the main streets bordering the square there
hangs a big blue propaganda billboard saying in English and
Chinese, ``Devote Our Great Efforts To Build Up The Socialist
Spiritual Foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Clinton will make any gesture in memory of the victims
of the Tiananmen crackdown is one of many question marks hovering
over this summit.
</P>
<P>
   The official welcome Saturday will be a stiff and formal affair
compared to the glorious extravaganza the Chinese staged on
Thursday night, little more than an hour after President and Mrs.
Clinton and their daughter Chelsea flew into the 600-year-old
former imperial capital of Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
   China's state television broke into its main evening news show
at 7:15 p.m. (China time) to announce that Air Force One had
landed. Until that interruption the news anchor hadn't mentioned
the Clinton visit, and the 10 p.m. news didn't give it very good
billing -- it was the fifth item reported, after news about such
momentous events as Prime Minister Zhu Rongji's visit to a drug
exhibit and a performance by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   At the colorful Xi'an show in front of the city's towering old
South Gate, which featured huge red lanterns, lithe dancers in
gauzy dresses and performers marching in through billows of smoke,
Clinton made oblique reference to some of the political
controversies studding his trip before it even began.
</P>
<P>
   ``Respect for the worth, the dignity, the potential and the
freedom of every citizen is a vital source of America's strength
and success,'' he told the select crowd of about 1,000 invited
onlookers, raising thoughts of the human rights issues so sensitive
here.
</P>
<P>
   And he added that providing all people opportunities to develop
``is vital to the strength and success of the new China, as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports that authorities arrested several dissidents in the days
leading up to Clinton's arrival added to the strain attending this
visit.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said he anticipates U.S.
Ambassador James Sasser ``will bring this up directly with the
Chinese government'' on Friday. He also said Clinton will encourage
China to permit free political dialogue when he holds formal talks
with Chinese President Jiang on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Before heading on to the controversial Tiananmen Square welcome,
Clinton will spend the day in Xi'an Friday, first touring the
resting place of more than 7,000 ancient terra cotta warriors,
horses and chariots, the 2,000-year-old wonder unearthed little
more than 20 years ago. Then he will talk to leaders of a local
village before heading on to Beijing on Friday night.

IN ESTATE PLANNING, A ROTH IRA SHINES

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investors seeking to take advantage of the single most lucrative
feature of the Roth individual retirement account will have to pay
a substantial penalty. The ultimate one.
</P>
<P>
   Though bushels of marketing materials for the new Roth IRA have
been thrown at young savers, the fact is that Roth IRAs are of far
greater benefit to a very different age group _ older investors
seeking to transfer wealth to the next generation after they die.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Roth IRAs so attractive for estate planning? Two big
things.
</P>
<P>
   First, unlike a traditional IRA, the Roth version does not
require distributions to begin at age 70{. This means that if a
retiree does not need the money in an IRA, the assets can keep
accumulating tax free.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the assets can be passed on to heirs without any
additional income taxes being owed. Unlike traditional IRAs, the
Roth variety offers tax-free distributions as long as the assets
are held in the account for five years.
</P>
<P>
   That one-two combination can yield enormous advantages for
beneficiaries. ``It's like a perpetual gift,'' said Christine
Fahlund, a certified financial planner at T. Rowe Price Associates
in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   For the majority of people, only income taxes need to be
considered in doing this planning. For the more affluent, however,
estate taxes are also a factor. Estate taxes kick in when the
assets in an estate exceed $625,000 (the amount will gradually rise
to $1 million by 2006), and the tax rates go as high as 55 percent.
But estate taxes can often be minimized by dividing assets between
spouses and sometimes by careful use of trusts.
</P>
<P>
   What can switching into a Roth IRA mean to heirs? Consider this
example from T. Rowe Price: Harry and Jane are each 70{ years old
and have a son, Andy, 40. Harry has $100,000 in a traditional IRA
that he wants to convert to a Roth IRA. He has $32,000 available in
a separate, taxable account to pay the taxes on the conversion.
Jane, the beneficiary, dies at age 80, Harry at age 85. Assuming an
8 percent return, that leaves Andy with a Roth IRA of $326,000 upon
Harry's death.
</P>
<P>
   What would have happened if Harry had kept his money in the
traditional IRA? First, the $32,000 he would have used to pay taxes
would have stayed in the taxable account, earning 5.4 percent
annually after taxes. Good. But he would have had to make mandatory
withdrawals from the traditional IRA.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, upon Harry's death, the traditional IRA would have
shrunk to $60,500 after taxes. But, the taxable account would have
grown to $223,500, assuming that the money withdrawn from the IRA
was added to it. Thus the total pot, using the traditional IRA, is
$284,000, or $42,000 less than the Roth IRA.
</P>
<P>
   That is a tidy difference for Andy, but not enough to quit his
job over.
</P>
<P>
   The big payoff comes when the two accounts are converted to a
stream of income over Andy's remaining life expectancy, 28 years.
If he takes distributions from the Roth IRA over that time,
assuming the 8 percent return, he will receive a total of $1.1
million, tax free.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the pot of money from the traditional IRA, earning
an after-tax rate of 5.4 percent, would give him $475,000 in
payments over his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   The big gap in payouts results from the fact that Harry and Jane
did not have to take minimum distributions from the Roth IRA. while
they were alive, and earnings are distributed to Andy tax free, Ms.
Fahlund said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got two buckets of a very different nature,'' she said.
``In one, you've got a bucket full of money that's completely tax
free for years to come and in the other you've got totally taxable
assets.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There are other perks, too. The Roth IRA lets you avoid having
to deal with beneficiary selections, irrevocable decisions that can
have nasty tax consequences.
</P>
<P>
   How? Most IRA holders are unwilling to name their children as
beneficiaries, preferring to name their spouse instead. That is
fine as long as the owner of the IRA dies first: the spouse takes
the money and names his or her children as beneficiaries. When the
spouse dies, the children either take the money out over five years
or over their life expectancy.
</P>
<P>
   But if the spouse dies before the account owner, the money in
the account must be distributed by the end of the year after the
latter's death. That means a big payment of income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tax nightmare,'' said Bruce Steiner, tax and estate
attorney at Kleinberg Kaplan Wolff &AMP; Cohen in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, a Roth IRA lacks such complications. The more
tax-efficient long-term payout is available regardless of which
spouse dies first. In fact, converting to a Roth IRA can be a great
way to get out of a distribution choice you've committed to.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a Roth IRA is not for everyone. First, to be
eligible, individuals must have adjusted gross income of less than
$100,000 a year. Second, they need to come up with the cash,
separate from the IRA, to pay the income taxes on the conversion
amount.
</P>
<P>
   Do the estate planning benefits of Roth IRAs sound to good to be
true? They may well be. Some planners doubt whether Congress, over
time, will keep allowing this tax-sheltered pool of national assets
to balloon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel it is too great a benefit for Congress to watch it
grow,'' said R. Mark Hochberg, an estate tax lawyer at Schanker &AMP;
Hochberg in Huntington, N.Y. ``I tell anyone to do a conversion or
set up an account now, because there's no assurance the Roth will
remain part of the law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors should also consider the state of the markets. If they
convert this year and stock prices plummet, they will have paid
taxes on inflated asset values.
</P>
<P>
   In light of the potentially limited window of opportunity,
financial advisers say investors would be wise to do a conversion
analysis soon, either with the help of a professional or an IRA
conversion software program or workbook. Most programs available to
consumers, however, focus on the lifetime of the owner and spouse _
not on estate planning.
</P>
<P>
   Why aren't more people making the switch to a Roth? ``In
general, the mistake people make is not being predisposed to doing
the conversion because of the immediate tax implications,'' said
Ross Levin, a certified financial planner and president of
Accredited Investors in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Some advisers are becoming far more direct.
</P>
<P>
   In what he volunteers is ``an extraordinary act of enlightened
self-interest,'' James Budros, a certified financial planner and
principal at Budros &AMP; Ruhlin in Columbus, Ohio, has offered to pay
the cost of converting his parents' $100,000 traditional IRA to a
Roth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm willing to pay taxes now,'' he said, ``to get big bucks
later.''

   GM STRIKE STARTS TO AFFECT WORKERS ACROSS THE NATION
</P>
<P>
   The strikes at two General Motors factories have forced the
automaker to curtail production at 100 parts factories, close 26 of
its 29 assembly plants in North America and temporarily lay off
147,900 workers.
</P>
<P>
   And now the effects are reaching across the country to other
companies. A windshield-wiper factory in Rochester, N.Y., has laid
off 1,200 workers and Lear Corp.'s car-seat factories from Delaware
to Texas have laid off 2,800 employees. Economists are also
reducing their estimates of the annualized growth rate of the
nation's economic output for the second quarter because of the
strike.
</P>
<P>
   SUNBEAM FACING A BLEAK OUTLOOK
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Sunbeam have plummeted 42 percent since the board of
the appliance maker dismissed its chief executive, Albert Dunlap
two weeks ago. Now the company has confirmed that the SEC is
investigating its accounting practices and Sunbeam is delaying
registering a planned bond offering.
</P>
<P>
   POWER CUTBACKS IN MIDWEST
</P>
<P>
   Utilities throughout the Midwest asked customers to cut the use
of appliances because of a heat wave that has resulted in a surge
in demand for electricity. Many industries in the region also
reduced their power consumption, canceling shifts and sending
workers home early.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSE APPROVES OVERHAUL OF IRS
</P>
<P>
   The House approved legislation worked out by House-Senate
negotiators that would lead to an internal reorganization of the
Internal Revenue Service, create an independent board to oversee
its operations and give taxpayers more rights and powers in
disputes with the tax collection agency.
</P>
<P>
   STRONG GROWTH IN FIRST QUARTER
</P>
<P>
   The economy grew at a 5.4 percent annual rate during the first
three months of this year, stronger than originally estimated.
</P>
<P>
   COMPUTER ISSUES LEAD STOCKS DOWN
</P>
<P>
   Concern about profits for the computer industry's bellwethers
sent the Nasdaq and Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock indexes down. The
Dow Jones industrial average rose 11.71, to 8,935.58.
</P>
<P>
   Yields on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 5.65 percent, from
5.66 percent Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   SAKS HIRES ADVISERS FOR ITS SALE
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the holding company for Saks Fifth Avenue has
approved a sale or merger of the 97-store chain. It retained
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. and Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. to assist with a deal
that would end the ownership of Investcorp International.
</P>
<P>
   OIL FALLS ON DOUBTS ABOUT CUTBACKS
</P>
<P>
   Oil futures snapped a four-day rally and fell almost 4 percent,
to $14.03 a barrel, on skepticism that oil producers would follow
through on promises to cut production sufficiently to reduce a
supply glut.
</P>
<P>
   GOP's LOW-BUDGET TOBACCO BILL
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders in the House of Representatives offered a
one-page outline of the kind of tobacco legislation they prefer as
an alternative to the ambitious anti-smoking bill shelved by the
Senate last week. The Republicans favor an advertising campaign to
discourage teen-age smoking, no increase in tobacco prices and
diminished authority of the Food and Drug Administration to
regulate tobacco products. &QL;

BITTERNESS MARKS END TO US EFFORT AT WORLD CUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NANTES, France _ Tab Ramos said the whole tournament had been a
mess, that he couldn't wait for it to end. Alexi Lalas said it was
a nightmare. Eric Wynalda called it tragic.
</P>
<P>
   Thus did the World Cup end for the Americans here Thursday
night, with finger-pointing and second-guessing and bitterness. The
coach had the wrong people on the field in the wrong formation. The
right people never got to play. The players who didn't play weren't
mature about it, weren't professional. Et cetera, et cetera.
</P>
<P>
   This is what three-and-out is like when you expected something
more, and the Yanks clearly did this time. ``At the end of the day,
it's the result that counts,'' US Soccer Federation president Alan
Rothenberg said after the Americans were blanked, 1-0, by
Yugoslavia in their group finale at the Stade de La Beaujoire.
``Three-and-out is unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   The three might have been a surprise _ the Yanks were convinced
they would beat Iran _ but the out never was. Nobody outside their
camp thought they would survive the first round this time, and
everybody inside it conceded it would be a long shot. This is the
team, after all, that couldn't beat the Mexicans or the Jamaicans
in its regional. ``And there is no Germany or Yugoslavia in our
confederation,'' Rothenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The finger-pointing and the second-guessing and the bitterness,
finally, were irrelevant. The Yanks were 150-1 shots here, and
150-1 shots watch the second round on TV in their rumpus rooms.
They are going home because they were in awe of the Germans. They
are going home because they are The Gang That Couldn't Shoot
Straight. They are going home because they scored one goal in 270
minutes and gave up five.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a good World Cup, and that's why we're going
home,'' said defender Marcelo Balboa, who got a token eight minutes
here after playing every minute four years ago when the host US
advanced to the second round. ``We didn't do what we did in 1994.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans were younger in 1994. They were playing at home in
1994. They had an easier draw in 1994. They had been together in
camp for months in 1994. They had an experienced coach in 1994. And
they didn't do as well in 1994 as it seemed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a poor game against Switzerland and we saved it with a
spectacular shot,'' Rothenberg said. ``We had a great game against
Colombia. We had a horrible game against Romania. We held the score
down against Brazil, so people thought it was a better effort than
it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything was different about 1998. The Americans had to play
16 qualifying matches. They had some players in Major League
Soccer, others scattered throughout Europe. They could rarely put
the same starters on the field more than two matches in a row. They
had half a dozen players over 30. They had a coach who was learning
on the job, whose fate was undecided until the team had already
qualified. They were playing overseas against a three-time champion
and one of the most explosive teams in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, the Americans were a team in transition, split
between old boys like Wynalda and Ramos and Balboa and rookies like
Chad Deering, Brian Maisonneuve, and David Regis. ``The team that
played in the World Cup is very different than the team that
qualified,'' said Wynalda, who was pulled midway through the opener
and never started again. ``That's not a criticism. That's a fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the team that qualified might have done better here. Odds
are it would not have. Ramos, who didn't play Thursday night after
starting against Iran and coming off the bench against Germany, had
missed most of the last 18 months after tearing up the same knee
twice. Wynalda, who had scored only one goal all year, had knee
surgery in April and did little when he did play here. Lalas and
Balboa weren't as young or as quick as Regis or Eddie Pope, who
took their places.
</P>
<P>
   So they got part-time minutes here, or none at all, and as loss
followed loss, they sounded off. Word from within the camp, never
substantiated, was that Sampson had threatened to send four
veterans home for their sour attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   The veterans, three of whom were playing in their third Cup,
felt they had carried the team for a decade and deserved better. So
when the wheels came off here with them sitting on the bench, they
blamed Sampson, who had dumped captain John Harkes, their blood
brother, in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tremendous disappointment, and there has to be
accountability,'' said Lalas, who played every minute in 1994 and
no minutes here. ``There's blame that'll go around.''
</P>
<P>
   The blame game is standard procedure among the three-and-outs.
The Saudis, South Koreans, and Tunisians dumped their coaches
before the first round was even over. The Spanish and Belgians and
Bulgarians are going home to a national chorus of hand-wringing and
derision. The Yanks are just going home, as 150-1 shots usually do.
Call it a mess, call it a nightmare, call it tragic. The French
merely called it ``la illusion Americaine.''

NHL OWNERS ADD SOME BALANCE TO OFFENSE
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The National Hockey League began tweaking its rules
Thursday to increase the offensive balance of the game. Measures
passed by the board of governors included a move of the goal line
farther out from the boards; the use of two referees, instead of
one, for a limited number of games; and the trimming of the goal
crease by two feet on each side to allow attackers to get closer to
the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   But the board tabled a proposal that would have made
regular-season games worth 3 points, instead of 2 points, in the
standings. The idea was suggested by Commissioner Gary Bettman in
an effort to reduce the number of tie games and to discourage
conservative play. Under the proposal, games decided in overtime
would be worth 2 points to the winning team and 1 point to the
loser, while a regulation victory would mean 3 points for the
winner.
</P>
<P>
   The board also amended the league constitution to limit
ownership interests by the same investors in more than one team.
This could immediately affect the Fox Group, which indirectly owns
a stake with the Rangers and has an option to buy a piece of the
Los Angeles Kings. ``We're going to have to sit down with them,''
Bettman said.
</P>
<P>
   No decision was made on future Olympic participation, which
resulted in mixed reviews after the Nagano Games, Japan. Some
owners, players and fans were unhappy with the length of the season
and a perception that interest waned in the league schedule and the
Stanley Cup playoffs after the 17-day break in February. One of
those owners was Bill Wirtz, of the Chicago Blackhawks and former
chairman of the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sitting out 17 days and they wonder why,'' Wirtz said
Thursday. ``It was stupid. It was ludicrous. They got taken.''
</P>
<P>
   In other rules changes, Bettman vowed longer suspensions against
a player who delivers blows to the head of an opponent. And he said
the board approved the use of two referees, instead of one, for a
limited number of games, along with two linesmen. Punishing stick
or elbow blows to the head could cut down on the alarming increase
in concussions sidelining stars such as Anaheim's Paul Kariya.
Using two referees could help detect obstruction fouls behind the
play while extending careers of veteran referees who become more
experienced but less athletic with age.
</P>
<P>
   Bettman said tests in Canada have shown that, under a
two-referee system, a referee skates 6 miles per game, instead of 9
and that heart rate is reduced by 20 beats per minute. The
goal-line movement and the reduction of the crease size could
improve the flow of attack.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the line is 11 feet from the backboards. Next season,
it will be 13 feet. The two feet will be taken away from the
neutral zone, two feet on each side of center ice. With more room
behind the net, it is hoped that goalies will be less able to clear
or hold pucks that are shot in by attackers. Combined with
increased enforcement of anti-obstruction rules, it is thought that
attacking forwards will have more opportunities to create scoring
chances.
</P>
<P>
   By trimming the crease by two feet on each side, attacking
players can get closer to the net for deflections, rebounds or
setting screens. Goals will still be nullified if attackers have
skates in the blue-painted crease. But the crease will now take up
less space. On the matter of crease interference, the board also
closed a loophole that prevented the video-review judge from
informing the referee if an attacker's skates were in the crease.
</P>
<P>
   The board also approved establishment of the Maurice Richard
trophy to honor the leading goal-scorer each season. The Art Ross
trophy already honors the overall points producer, goals combined
with assists.
</P>
<P>
   Richard, the former Canadiens great, has cancer but has been out
and about recently. He is believed to be currently on a fishing
trip, the kind of thing hockey people used to do in the summer,
back when Richard played, when the playoffs ended in April and the
league had a longer off season. &QL;

PARENTS OF JONBENET RAMSEY END 3 DAYS OF QUESTIONING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Fla., Egypt)  (mk) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. _ With the threat looming of a grand jury inquest
into the murder of JonBenet Ramsey, the parents of the murdered
beauty princess Thursday completed three days of questioning by
prosecutors here, breaking their 16 months of official silence.
</P>
<P>
   John and Patsy Ramsey, who last talked to Boulder investigators
on April 30, 1997, were questioned separately, and in videotaped
interviews by prosecutors, according to Alex Hunter, Boulder's
district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. and Mrs. Ramsey have been cooperative,'' Hunter said after
questioning ended Thursday afternoon. ``Questioning was not
restricted in content or length. The Ramseys have agreed to
continue to cooperate and to provide certain documents.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, investigators from Hunter's office traveled two
weeks ago to the Ramsey's new home in Atlanta and conducted three
interviews with Burke Ramsey, the little girl's 11-year-old
brother. The Ramseys and their two children were the only people
known to be living at the Ramsey house on the night of the murder,
18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Ramsey's have long declined to be interviewed by
police, whom they characterized as biased in the case, their
attorney said recently the couple would cooperate with the grand
jury.
</P>
<P>
   A new grand jury was impaneled here two months ago. Early this
month, Boulder police spent two days detailing the case to Hunter.
At the end of the closed-door sessions, Hunter indicated that he
would decide whether or not to call a grand jury by early July. On
Thursday, he said: ``I do not know when I will make this
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Boulder's new police chief, Mark Beckner, urged the
prosecutor to convene a grand jury for the case. Earlier this
month, Beckner, who has directed the murder investigation since
October, said that there were ``30 reasons'' why a grand jury
investigation was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an idea who did it,'' he continued, conceding: ``It's
certainly a circumstantial case.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Beckner said he was ``excited'' about new
evidence. According to news reports, this new evidence came from
laboratory tests on clothes the parents wore the night of the
murder. In addition, tests recently confirmed that a felt pen found
in the Ramsey house was used to write the ransom note. Boulder
police already had said that the ransom note was written on a pad
found in the house.
</P>
<P>
   Although the police chief and district attorney both have said
that the Ramseys fall under ``the umbrella of suspicion,'' they
have not formally named any suspects.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the investigation has cost this small city $1 million in
additional police and prosecution expenses. In an accounting,
Boulder police said that, as of early June, they had interviewed
590 people, investigated 122 suspects and taken 1,058 pieces of
evidence. The public had come forward with 700 telephone tips and
3,400 letters.
</P>
<P>
   By talking to prosecutors now, the Ramseys may be trying to head
off grand jury appearances later this summer. When talking with
prosecutors, the Ramseys are not under oath, can refuse to answer
questions, can benefit from considerable advice from their defense
attorneys, and can avoid running a media gauntlet to enter a
courthouse. These conditions do not generally apply in a grand jury
setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You only use a grand jury to compel evidence: testimony or
documents,'' said Craig Silverman, a former Denver prosecutor who
is now a defense attorney. ``They may prefer to testify in a
relaxed setting, not under oath. They knew of Hunter's deadline to
decide on a grand jury. This is a game of chicken.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While JonBenet is now a household name from here to Finland, not
everyone in this quiet college town is enamored of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, two men rented the Ramsey family's Tudor-style
mansion, which had remained empty since the murder. To discourage
gawkers, the men promptly planted three large spruce trees to block
the street view.
</P>
<P>
   Also last month, John Eller, the first police commander of the
JonBenet investigation, was in Key West, Fla., trying
unsuccessfully be hired as police chief of that town, 2,000 miles
from here.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Bellipanni, the Boulder District Court chief judge who
was expected to preside over a JonBenet grand jury, resigned last
month, after 15 years on the job. He is moving to Cairo to take a
U.S.-government-funded job as an adviser to reform Egypt's court
system. His move to the far side of the globe prompted The Denver
Post to headline: ``Trading Ramseys for Ramses.''

GOVERNORS VOTE RULES AIMED AT SPEEDING UP THE GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Every NHL coach reminds his players to keep their feet
moving, and Thursday the league's Board of Governors did the same,
ratifying a number of rule changes aimed at making the game faster
_ including the addition of a second referee in the 1998-99 season.
</P>
<P>
   Not all games next season will have a second ref on duty,
according to commissioner Gary Bettman, but perhaps 10 or 20 games
in every NHL rink will have the extra whistle-blower added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some studies have shown that one referee skates 9 miles per
game and the addition of a second ref cuts that down to about 6
miles,'' said Bettman. ``And a study by a Canadian college showed
that a second ref out there cuts a ref's average heart rate down by
20 beats per minute.''
</P>
<P>
   The reduced miles and heart stress could help referees stay
longer on the job. NHL referees now typically are labeled for
retirement by their mid-40s. A second ref, the league hopes, will
enable some of its best arbiters to stay on the job into their 50s.
Another major advantage of a two-referee system: faster games.
Preseason experiments with two refs pared some 16 minutes off the
length of games.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on the recommendation of their general managers, the
Lords of the Boards also approved pulling the nets closer to the
neutral zone, clipping the wings off the crease area, and allowing
the video goal judge to call down to the surface and inform
referees that a man was in the crease when a goal was scored.
Previously, the referee had to initiate the call upstairs, a move
that became all too familiar to Bruins fans last spring when Tim
Taylor's toe in the crease negated a P.J. Axelsson overtime goal in
Game 3 of the playoffs against the Capitals.
</P>
<P>
   A closer look at the rule changes:
</P>
<P>
   _The goal lines, previously 11 feet from the end boards, will be
placed 13 feet out, reducing the neutral zone from 58 to 54 feet.
The increase of some 20 percent in room behind the net should allow
for more playmaking and discourage goalies from handling the puck.
Overall, there should be more skating and passing and less room in
the middle of the ice for trapping defenses.
</P>
<P>
   _The arc of the crease's blue zone, which previously extended 3
feet from the side of each post, will be cut back by 2 feet.
Attacking forwards now can muscle within 12 inches of the post and
within about a boot length from the top of the crease. The change
should make it easier for players to score and, more important, cut
down significantly on interference calls. Note to Bruins fans:
Taylor's skate would not have been in the blue paint if the smaller
crease had been used this year. Tell that to the hockey gods.
</P>
<P>
   _The video goal judge doesn't have to bite his lip if he clearly
sees a crease infraction. However, the referee maintains the right
to allow a goal in such circumstances if he believes the attacking
player was pushed into the crease by a defending player.
</P>
<P>
   _If the addition of a second referee brings the desired results,
there is an outside chance that all of next year's playoff games
will have four on-ice officials on duty: two referees and two
linesmen. The league will have to hire a handful of full-time
referees for the phase-in period this year and upward of 16 more if
it becomes a 1,107-game (27 cities, 41 home games per team)
proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Bettman also said the league will levy stiffer suspensions to
players who deliberately use sticks or elbows that result in head
injuries to opponents. During the preseason, the league also will
experiment with the elimination of the center-ice red line in
regard to two-line (offside) passes.

OPERA STUCK IN CHINA AS TALKS FAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (subs to make headline more concise)   (bl)  
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ At precisely the same time that President
Clinton arrived to a colorfully choreographed welcoming ceremony in
Xian on Thursday evening, a remarkable drama about a different
strand of U.S.-Chinese relations was wrapping up at Shanghai
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   In a seedy-looking departure lounge, Nigel Redden, director of
New York's Lincoln Center Festival, sat down for a final talk with
Shanghai Culture Bureau Director Ma Bomin, who has been blocking
the classic Chinese opera ``The Peony Pavilion'' from arriving in
New York in time for its scheduled opening July 7.
</P>
<P>
   Redden's flight was scheduled for 7:40 p.m., and he was informed
in the late afternoon that Ms. Ma would go to the airport to see
him off, because she had something to say.
</P>
<P>
   At 7 p.m. in the bar, Ms. Ma informed Redden that her bureau was
now willing to compromise on the matter that kicked off this whole
drama a week ago: blocking the shipment of elaborate sets, costumes
and props. The shipment, Ms. Ma said, could now proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Redden, suspicious after days of fruitless negotiations, quickly
asked a pertinent question: What about the actors? Would they be
allowed to go too ?
</P>
<P>
   No, Ms. Ma said with a grimace, the actors of the Kunqu Opera
Company would not yet be allowed to perform, as she had said over
and over, unless the opera was fully restaged to fit government
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Costumes, but no actors. Perfect. So a high-profile example of
cultural exchange between the United States and China lay in ruins,
on the day President Clinton arrived for a state visit, precisely
the time when Chinese and United States officials are most eager to
clear away unnecessary public conflict.
</P>
<P>
   To an arts executive like Redden, it is stunning that Chinese
authorities would want to prevent any ancient Chinese opera from
being performed in New York (especially since Lincoln Center is
paying). But it became clear in recent days that Chinese
officialdom was not against ``The Peony Pavilion,'' so much as one
particular official was, and her name is Ma.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ma's comments suggest that some petty political motives _
power over artistic troupes, professional jealousy, the right to
censor _ may play as big a role as the artistic objections she
cited, complaining that the work was a national treasure that
needed to be protected from unorthodox interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   And the reluctance of any higher Chinese authority to rein her
in suggests that she wields considerable political clout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep asking about it, and the reaction is always `It's
extremely complicated,' '' said Raymond Burghardt, U.S. consul
general in Shanghai. ``Well, why is it so complicated?'' Burghardt
was asking the question rhetorically, since as a diplomat with long
experience in China he knows that calling a matter ``extremely
complicated'' is a polite way of saying that there are a lot of
politics involved.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Burghardt fudged when asked whether President Clinton would
inquire about the opera, even though one polite question from
Clinton, voiced to a Chinese leader, could conceivably solve the
issue in an instant.
</P>
<P>
   At the airport Thursday evening, Redden began to let his
frustration show after making so little headway in negotiations,
particularly when Ms. Ma, a former opera singer, tried to tell
reporters who had been hastily assembled that her compromise showed
how her bureau had been so flexible in these talks
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no flexibility at all,'' Redden protested.
``I've been here since Monday, and have been met with no
cooperation whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   As her aides started insisting that Redden leave because his
flight was boarding, Ms. Ma turned to the reporters again to say,
in Chinese, that perhaps both sides should continue to keep
talking, since there were more avenues to be pursued.
</P>
<P>
   When the comment was translated to Redden, he apparently thought
Ms. Ma had actually meant what she said. He immediately ripped up
his boarding pass and said, ``So let's talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking shocked, as though a major headache on the verge of
flying away had now decided to stick around, Ms. Ma again described
her concern about the opera's script, and how it would be necessary
to unpack the costumes to rehearse. So maybe, she said, that
shipment should not actually be allowed to go to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, Redden was presented with a new boarding pass. It
was clear that Ms. Ma had no real interest in negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   After Redden left, Ms. Ma turned to the reporters again and made
another pitch: maybe Lincoln Center would accept a safer version of
``The Peony Pavilion,'' one that was simpler to stage, that used
none of the innovative techniques of Chen Shi-Zheng, the director
hired by Lincoln Center, whom Ms. Ma, to put it mildly, does not
like.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have already started rehearsing,'' Ms. Ma said,
brightening. ``We could certainly take it to Lincoln Center in time
for their festival.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen, dejected by the opera's demise, lamented that bureaucrats
like Ms. Ma seemed to have no sense that a serious arts festival
like Lincoln Center's actually valued artistic integrity and
vision, and would not simply slap in a replacement performance by
another troupe if the original was blocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, `The Peony Pavilion' itself is about pursuing a
dream, and how you need it to survive,'' said Chen, who left China
in 1987 and became an American citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Musing about his own dream of staging the opera in its original
and full 55-act, 20-hour form, he said, ``In China today, it is so
clear, that kind of spirit is not allowed to live.''

HIGH COURT'S LINE-ITEM RULING PRAISED IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also SCOTUS-VETO) 
(mk) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Government and hospital officials in New York state
praised the Supreme Court's decision to strike down the president's
line-item veto power Thursday, saying that it would preserve a set
of state hospital taxes that help finance health care for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The decision settles in New York's favor a longstanding
disagreement between the state and federal government over the
legality of some of those taxes, which raised $2.6 billion for
health care programs from 1992 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   State and city officials had been concerned that if they lost
the dispute, the Clinton administration would require the state,
city and many hospitals to reimburse some of that money, with
potentially devastating consequences for patient care and
government budgets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very gratified we won this because I realized the impact
this would have had, not only on the city, but in particular on the
ability of hospitals to care for those people who are the weakest
and in the most vulnerable positions, people without medical
insurance,'' said Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   The city, where most of the state's Medicaid recipients live,
was a plaintiff in one of the lawsuits challenging the
constitutionality of the line-item veto, along with hospital groups
and unions for health care workers.
</P>
<P>
   At issue were taxes New York state has levied on hospitals for
many years to finance health care programs for the poor, including
health insurance for children in low-income families, AIDS services
and poison control centers. Under Medicaid, the federal health care
program for the poor, Washington matched much of the revenue raised
by those taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1995, the Clinton administration raised concerns about
whether some of the taxes were legal under a 1991 federal law
intended to prevent Medicaid abuses by states. New York requested a
waiver from the 1991 law, but after much haggling, the
administration declined to grant one.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated with the stalemate and concerned that the
administration would eventually demand repayment of some of the
federal matching funds, New York state officials and city hospital
officials asked New York's senators, Alfonse D'Amato, a Republican,
and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat, to insert language in a
1997 budget bill declaring the taxes legal and absolving the state
of responsibility for repaying any of the Medicaid matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   The senators complied and the measure was approved by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, White House officials were searching for
budget provisions that would be appropriate for Clinton's inaugural
use of the line-item veto. Last August, the president selected
three, one of which was the Moynihan-D'Amato amendment, contending
that the measure would set a damaging precedent.
</P>
<P>
   The veto almost immediately became a political headache for the
administration, as New York Democrats joined labor unions, hospital
officials, advocates for the poor and Republicans in assailing the
president for jeopardizing programs for the indigent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was never really clear that the administration was on the
verge of declaring the state's hospital taxes illegal. And even had
it done that, many federal officials said, it would have been
unlikely for the administration to demand that the state, with its
large pool of Democratic voters, or its hospitals reimburse any of
the Medicaid funds.
</P>
<P>
   Still, hospital officials declared Thursday that the Supreme
Court had rescued New York's hospital system from a potential
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had to pay this money back, it would have come at
inducing a crisis in the health care system,'' said Kenneth Raske,
president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, a hospital
trade group.

KING LAWYER ERRS DURING TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don King's lawyers were recovering Thursday from a strategic
error that led a federal judge to throw out two days of key
testimony in the promoter's criminal retrial for allegedly
defrauding a Lloyd's of London syndicate by faking expenses after a
Julio Cesar Chavez fight was canceled in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   King's defense chose a risky path to question Donald Cayea, a
syndicate lawyer. Peter Fleming Jr. and King's other lawyers were
barred by U.S. District Judge Lawrence McKenna from identifying
themselves as the same King team at the settlement talks, lest they
be recast as unsworn witnesses, and possibly dispute testimony by a
sworn witness. But late Wednesday, Fleming said, ``I was there,''
while questioning Cayea.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming called the slip-up a mistake, and McKenna believed it
was inadvertent. Fleming said the loss of the testimony did not
kill the defense's case.
</P>
<P>
   McKenna ordered the jurors to disregard the testimony, without
saying that Fleming had violated a court order.
</P>
<P>
   Cayea's most contentious testimony, that King's defense offered
money to settle the civil fraud case to get potentially exculpatory
evidence for the criminal trial, led King's lawyers to ask for a
mistrial.
</P>
<P>
   King's defense said no such offer occurred, and accused Baruch
Weiss, an assistant U.S. attorney, of eliciting testimony he knew
was wrong. McKenna did not rule on the mistrial application. &QL;

AHCCCS (Phoenix) _ Beverly HIlls millioinaire and Valley apartment
mogul Michael Phillips recently got an operation here. Trouble is,
authorities say, he claimed he was destitute and conned
AHCCCS,Arizona's healthcare system for the indigent, into paying
for the knifework. Phillips was arrested Thursday, but AHCCCS
officials say there are hundreds like him out there and they may

   VETO (Washington) _ The US Supreme Court onThursday struck down
what John McCain and congressonal republicans had hoped would be
their legacy: a law giving the president authority to curb
pork-barrel spending through limited veto authority. The court's
6-3 decision (with Arizona's O'Conner dissenting) capped a rough
fortnight for McCain, who had worked for this for 10 years.
McCain's tobacco bill was defeated last week, and at the same time
he came under fire for making a crude joke about the president's
daughter. By JEFF BARKER. Story will move in the ``A'' category.

   DIRTYAIR (Phoenix) _ Coal-fired power plants built before 1977
are the dirtiest, are exempt from new clean-air standards and could
hold an unfair economic advantage _ and never be cleaned up _ under
efforts to deregulate the electric-utility industry. Ending this
regulation ``loophole'' from six plants in Arizona, for example,
would reduce as much air pollution as removing 2.3 million cars
from the road, or every car in Maricopa County. A
consumer-environmental group, U.S. Public Interest Research Group,
calls on Congress to eliminate the loopholes for older plants. By
STEVE YOZWIAK. Story will move in the ``A'' category.

   BEIJING _ Mao Tse-Tung's ghostly portrait beamed down on
Tiananmen Square as China prepared an ear-splitting 21-gun salute
Saturday for the American president Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton began his China tour with robed dancers and
heart-thudding drumbeats at China's old imperial capital of Xi'an
on Thursday night, but the events on Saturday at Beijing's infamous
downtown square will be the centerpiece of his nine-day visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If China will cooperate with America, then nobody can defeat
China,'' said Wei Wenqing, 86, on the day President Clinton became
the first U.S. leader in a decade to land on Chinese soil. The
gnarled pensioner was out for an afternoon walk on the exact spot
where Clinton is due to receive the ceremonial Tiananmen Square
greeting that the U.S. House of Representatives urged the president
to refuse.
</P>
<P>
   Workers could be seen polishing the brass doors of the Great
Hall of the People. This massive parliament building, which
resembles an over-grown Soviet-built subway station, will be the
television backdrop as Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin
stride down a formation of People's Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers
on the western edge of the world's biggest public square.
</P>
<P>
   If China's past practice is followed, the troops Clinton reviews
will be carrying highly polished fixed bayonets.
</P>
<P>
   Following the 15-minute outdoor ceremony, Clinton and the
71-year-old Jiang are due to mount a set of stone steps leading
into the Great Hall of the People for the first session of their
Beijing summit conference.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-gun salute Clinton will receive is an honor that China
reserves for a rarefied group of foreign leaders it regards as
especially worth cultivating. In this decade they have included
Japanese Emperor Akihito in 1992, King Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia
in 1994, Russian President Boris Yeltsin in 1997 and Bulgarian
President Petur Stoyanov last month.
</P>
<P>
   Except for hauling in some extra flower pots, the Chinese seemed
to be making no effort to prettify the square that to many in
America symbolizes the Chinese Communist Party's cold-blooded
suppression of the 1989 student-led pro-democracy movement.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, along one of the main streets bordering the square there
hangs a big blue propaganda billboard saying in English and
Chinese, ``Devote Our Great Efforts To Build Up The Socialist
Spiritual Foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Clinton will make any gesture in memory of the victims
of the Tiananmen crackdown is one of many question marks hovering
over this summit.
</P>
<P>
   The official welcome Saturday will be a stiff and formal affair
compared to the glorious extravaganza the Chinese staged on
Thursday night, little more than an hour after President and Mrs.
Clinton and their daughter Chelsea flew into the 600-year-old
former imperial capital of Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
   China's state television broke into its main evening news show
at 7:15 p.m. (China time) to announce that Air Force One had
landed. Until that interruption the news anchor hadn't mentioned
the Clinton visit, and the 10 p.m. news didn't give it very good
billing -- it was the fifth item reported, after news about such
momentous events as Prime Minister Zhu Rongji's visit to a drug
exhibit and a performance by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   At the colorful Xi'an show in front of the city's towering old
South Gate, which featured huge red lanterns, lithe dancers in
gauzy dresses and performers marching in through billows of smoke,
Clinton made oblique reference to some of the political
controversies studding his trip before it even began.
</P>
<P>
   ``Respect for the worth, the dignity, the potential and the
freedom of every citizen is a vital source of America's strength
and success,'' he told the select crowd of about 1,000 invited
onlookers, raising thoughts of the human rights issues so sensitive
here.
</P>
<P>
   And he added that providing all people opportunities to develop
``is vital to the strength and success of the new China, as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports that authorities arrested several dissidents in the days
leading up to Clinton's arrival added to the strain attending this
visit.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said he anticipates U.S.
Ambassador James Sasser ``will bring this up directly with the
Chinese government'' on Friday. He also said Clinton will encourage
China to permit free political dialogue when he holds formal talks
with Chinese President Jiang on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Before heading on to the controversial Tiananmen Square welcome,
Clinton will spend the day in Xi'an Friday, first touring the
resting place of more than 7,000 ancient terra cotta warriors,
horses and chariots, the 2,000-year-old wonder unearthed little
more than 20 years ago. Then he will talk to leaders of a local
village before heading on to Beijing on Friday night.

HOW PAUL PIERCE DROPPED INTO PITINO'S CLUTCHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A day later, the same questions remained. How on earth did Paul
Pierce, seen by many as the best all-around athlete in the NBA
draft, slide all the way into Rick Pitino's grateful hands at No.
10?
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing theory Thursday _ there had to be some
explanation, after all _ was that Pierce had suffered because of
lackluster workouts with the five teams for whom he auditioned.
Based on conversations with executives of three of those teams, as
well as Pierce's (admittedly biased) agent, that theory appears to
be as valid as the one about the flat earth.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Pierce slid to No. 10 for two main reasons: The top teams
drafted according to need and a small forward was not a top
priority for most, and he let it be known to three teams drafting
ahead of the Celtics _ two of whom he never worked out for _ that
he would not want to play for them.
</P>
<P>
   The Pierce story actually is one of two parts: what happened in
the first five picks and what happened in the next five. Suffice it
to say that when Pierce was not selected in the first five picks,
he already was ticketed to Boston. It was only a matter of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll say this,'' said Sacramento personnel boss Jerry
Reynolds. ``Every team Paul Pierce passed on his way to Boston is
sick about it. Boston is very, very lucky. He is going to be a
big-time player.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce's agent, Aaron Goodwin, still was shocked to be making
plans for Pierce to visit in Los Angeles with Pitino, who flew West
Thursday. Goodwin figured Pierce would be meeting instead with
Brian Hill, Stu Jackson, and the rest of the Vancouver brain trust
in British Columbia. Asked about reports that Pierce performed
poorly or was out of shape, Goodwin said, ``He is in excellent
shape and each team was impressed with what they saw. That was a
never a question. If you don't believe me, ask them.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, we did. We discovered the same thing. That sets the stage
for the first part of the story.
</P>
<P>
   The first five picks:
</P>
<P>
   Pierce worked out for the Clippers, Grizzlies, Nuggets, Raptors,
and Warriors. He had no chance of landing with the Clippers, who
picked first, or the Raptors, who picked fourth. Goodwin also knew
there was no chance Pierce would go second if the Clippers took
Mike Bibby. But the Clippers instead took center Michael
Olowokandi. It was now the Grizzlies' turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until 20 minutes before the Grizzlies made their pick,''
Goodwin said Thursday from his hotel in Vancouver, ``I was certain
that Paul was going to Vancouver. Why it changed we don't know. But
I knew something was up when I saw Bibby get called for a meeting
with Stu 15 minutes before the whole thing started.''
</P>
<P>
   The Grizzlies knew by then that Olowokandi was going No. 1.
Pierce was a fit at big guard, or so Goodwin thought. ``We were
trying to get him there,'' said Goodwin, who also represents
Shareef Abdur-Rahim.
</P>
<P>
   One theory being floated is that agent David Falk, who
represents Bibby, was already fuming that the Clippers had passed
on his client and, shall we say, made a strong case for Bibby.
Another had the Grizzlies deciding between Bibby and Vince Carter,
who is more of a shooting guard than Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   A third is probably closer to the truth: Bibby is a point guard,
one of the two most critical positions on a team. And last year's
point guard flopperoo in Vancouver, Antonio Daniels, was traded to
San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came down to Paul or Mike, and we thought Mike was
better,'' said Noah Croom, the Grizzlies' assistant general
manager. ``It had nothing to do with Paul's workout. He was fine.
He was enthusiastic about the city, which sometimes can be a
problem for us. We can't understand why he fell that far, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin said that once the Grizzlies took Bibby, Pierce's next
hope was Golden State. Once Olowokandi went, Denver was going big
with Raef LaFrentz. Goodwin and Pierce knew that. The Nuggets still
liked Pierce's workout; he just wasn't their player. The Raptors
were next. They also were one of the teams on Pierce's
you-know-what list, so they were out of the picture.
</P>
<P>
   The Warriors, however, were a different story. They could use a
small forward. They didn't choose Pierce. They took Antawn Jamison.
</P>
<P>
   ``We liked Jamison better,'' said assistant general manager Gary
Fitzsimmons. ``Paul had a good workout with us. I think in
retrospect, what may have hurt him is that he did all his workouts
early, most before June 1. And sometimes people forget what they
see early. But he wasn't out of shape and he worked out well.''
</P>
<P>
   The next five picks:
</P>
<P>
   By this point, Pierce and Goodwin were still wondering what was
going on. A trade between Dallas and Milwaukee already had taken
care of the sixth pick, with the Mavericks drafting Robert Traylor
for Milwaukee. That left the Kings at No. 7. Sacramento was another
team Pierce expressed a desire not to play for. There is some bad
blood between the Kings and Goodwin; he represents Mitch Richmond.
The Kings drafted Florida point guard Jason Williams, a shocker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We considered him,'' Reynolds said of Pierce, ``but not for
very long. I think by that time, us and some other teams had
already decided on our guy figuring (Pierce) wasn't going to be
around. Everyone knows Paul Pierce is going to be very good. But we
feel the guy we took is going to very good, too. And he's a point
guard. We felt we needed help there more than at shooting guard.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia was the last obstacle to Boston. Larry Brown
coached at Kansas and has a North Carolina tie-in with Jayhawks
coach Roy Williams. He very easily could have pulled the trigger on
Pierce. He did not. He instead took Larry Hughes, a ballhandling,
scoring guard who can relieve Allen Iverson of some of the burden
of running the team. Brown already had Tim Thomas at small forward.
</P>
<P>
   Brown actually took a poll among coaches and scouts between
Pierce and Hughes, and it was divided. President Pat Croce then
asked GM Billy King whom King wanted. He said Hughes. Brown said
the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Pierce was going No. 2,'' Brown told reporters.
``Everybody knows how much I love Pierce. But we have Tim Thomas to
play that position. I had to make the choice that was best for us.
We needed a bigger guard who could handle the ball. This is a true
backcourt.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Pierce was a lock for Boston. Just to make certain, Goodwin
notified the Bucks that Pierce had no desire to play there.
Milwaukee had Glenn Robinson and Ray Allen at the two positions
Pierce might play. But the Bucks were picking for Dallas, anyway,
so it made no difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew Boston would be a good place for him and that Rick was
very receptive to getting him,'' Goodwin said. ``It's a bit of a
bittersweet situation, but the bottom line is that he's with a team
that wants him, that he feels comfortable playing for, and that
provides a good fit.''

   &UR; So won't you say you love me,  &LR;   &UR; I'll make you so proud of me,
 &LR;   &UR; We'll make 'em turn their heads  &LR;   &UR; Every place we go.  &LR;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ As it had to, it all began with a love song, and
those were the words: the lyrics of ``Be My Baby,'' co-written by
Phil Spector and sung by his future wife, Ronnie, and the other
Ronettes.
</P>
<P>
   They were the first of the great bad-girl groups, and with their
architecturally unstable black beehive hairdos and provocative dark
eye makeup, they whu-oh-oh-oh'd their sultry way to stardom. ``Be
My Baby'' sold more than 2 million copies in 1963, even more than
their other hits like ``Baby I Love You'' and ``Walking in the
Rain.''
</P>
<P>
   But now the music is over, and in a civil lawsuit in the cramped
chambers of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, 24 years after her
divorce, Ronnie Spector Greenfield and the two other Ronettes are
suing the rock legend for $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is a spectacle that has provided further evidence, as
if more were needed, that the Golden Oldies age expired not with a
bang, or a whimper, or even a doo-wop, but with a bleat of lawyers.
Echoing an increasingly popular refrain among performers from that
era, the Ronettes contend that they were cheated by a conniving
producer who took advantage of their naivete, exploited their
talent and left them with little to show for their stardom but
memories.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs claim that after recording 28 songs with Spector,
they were paid a pittance in the early 1960s, and that Spector has
wrongly deprived them of millions, not only from the sale of their
records but also from the licensing of their hit songs in
commercials and television shows like ``Moonlighting,'' and in
films like ``Dirty Dancing'' and ``Goodfellas.''
</P>
<P>
   Spector says the Ronettes were simply hirelings, rock 'n' roll
elements in the complex mini-symphonies he conceived and recorded,
and that the success of the records was attributable to his
production wizardry. Furthermore, his lawyers contend, Mrs.
Greenfield signed away all her rights to royalties in their 1974
divorce settlement.
</P>
<P>
   This week, as Spector has defended himself in the witness box,
spectators have swarmed the courtroom for a glimpse of the creator
of the Wall of Sound: Spector's much-imitated recording technique
of overdubbing squadrons of guitars, pianos and percussion
instruments in a wave of hormone-thrilling noise.
</P>
<P>
   But instead, visitors have often experienced the sound of
silence. Long pauses have punctuated the 58-year-old Spector's
sometimes inaudible answers to lawyers' questions.
</P>
<P>
   In his frequently affectless testimony, there is little evidence
of the rocker who played guitar in the Rolling Stones recording of
``Play With Fire.'' At times he has seemed positively elfin as he
slyly parried questions from the plaintiffs' lawyer. At other
times, his demeanor was so dour it recalled the drug-pusher
character he played in a cameo appearance in the 1969 film ``Easy
Rider.''
</P>
<P>
   With his pale visage shrouded as ever by inky shades and framed
by dark shoulder-length hair, Spector has favored black shirts,
black and blue silk ties and black platform shoes, set off by a red
AIDS ribbon and a diamond earring in his left ear.
</P>
<P>
   In her turn on the witness stand, the 54-year-old Mrs.
Greenfield has described her life as a Ronette from Spanish Harlem
who toured the world as a star, and has told horror stories of her
marriage of nearly six years to Spector.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the drama inherent in these revelations of an
ooh-wah donnybrook, the testimony has at times put observers to
sleep with technical discussions of ``synchronization rights'' and
``recording masters,'' not to mention long evidentiary
presentations of records and discs referred to by the lawyers as
``product.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the nonjury trial came to a temporary hiatus after
hours of legal wrangling; due to Judge Paula Omansky's crowded
court schedule, trial proceedings will resume on July 13.
</P>
<P>
   His former wife's case ``is all a lot of nonsense,'' said
Spector after he stepped down from the stand. ``Some people, after
30 years, maybe they could realize that they have something to do
with the fact that they're not Tina Turner or Diana Ross.''
</P>
<P>
   Out in the hallway, signing autographs and wearing sunglasses
even darker than Spector's, Mrs. Greenfield said, ``I'm stunned
that this has finally come to trial.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``He owes me big time.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The Ronettes _ Ronnie, her sister and their cousin _ had started
performing in 1959, but first won music-mogul attention in 1961 as
singing go-go dancers in the Joey Dee Review at the Peppermint
Lounge in Manhattan during the frenzy over Chubby Checker and the
Twist. Soon they were recruited as live performers in Murray the
K's rock shows; Spector took notice and tried to sign their lead
singer, Veronica Bennett _ Ronnie _ to his Philles record label.
</P>
<P>
   But the group loyally stuck together, so Spector signed them
all, first as background vocalists for Darlene Love and other
Spector stars, and then as the centerpiece of their own Wall of
Sound recordings. By 1964, Spector became their manager, but by the
time he married Ronnie in 1968, the group had disbanded.
</P>
<P>
   The two divorced in 1974. In his testimony, Spector described
his relationship with Ronnie as ``a good strong loving
relationship,'' though he noted, over the Ronettes' lawyer's
objection, that ``Veronica had a lot of problems with drinking and
mixing medication.''
</P>
<P>
   In court and in her 1986 autobiography, titled, not
surprisingly, ``Be My Baby,'' Mrs. Greenfield has alleged that
Spector engaged in bizarre and psychologically abusive behavior in
their 23-room Los Angeles mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Spector's reputation as a top-of-the-charts cut-up dates back to
the late 1950s, when he told interviewers that the theme of his
first big hit, ``To Know Him Is to Love Him,'' was taken from the
inscription on his father's gravestone. Soon he was being profiled
as ``the First Tycoon of Teen.''
</P>
<P>
   But during the trial, Mrs. Greenfield testified that Spector
frustrated her singing career and held her as a virtual prisoner,
confiscating her shoes and surrounding her with guard dogs.
</P>
<P>
   She also testified that she had signed their 1974 divorce
settlement, including a clause forfeiting all future record
profits, because ``Phil threatened me several times.'' She added:
``He told me `I'll kill you' and said, `I'll have a hit man kill
you.'''
</P>
<P>
   On the witness stand, Spector denied that he kept his wife as an
involuntary prisoner and he rejected the hit man allegations,
saying rather joylessly, ``I've heard them over the last 20
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The divorce allegations are irrelevant to the case, said Andrew
Bart, Spector's lawyer. But Alexander Peltz, the Ronettes' lawyer,
said, ``The marital testimony goes to the issue of what she gave up
in the divorce settlement, and what feelings he had against her,
and why he prevented her from getting any money all those years.''
</P>
<P>
   Peltz is seeking damages for breach of contract as well as
former and future earnings, and he says the Ronettes are entitled
to share in profits from the original recordings.
</P>
<P>
   Bart says that it is ``a simple case,'' since Mrs. Greenfield
signed away all her rights to the group's recording earnings in her
divorce settlement and thereby invalidated a 1963 contract signed
by the Ronettes. ``She released Phil and all of his companies from
claims, contracts and legal action,'' Bart said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Greenfield ``is trying to build a case out of sympathy
instead of legal principle,'' Bart contended.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to make Phil look like an ogre,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Including the preliminary maneuvering, the legal action has
dragged on for 13 years. Mrs. Greenfield has remarried and had two
children, and lives in Connecticut. Her husband, Jonathan, her
manager, hovered protectively on Wednesday when she joined the
spectators.
</P>
<P>
   Spector has been sporadically active in the music business since
the appearance of his magnum opus, ``Phil Spector: Back to Mono,''
a boxed collection of his work from 1958 to 1969 that appeared
early this decade.
</P>
<P>
   The other plaintiffs are Mrs. Greenfield's sister, Estelle
Bennett Dong, and her cousin, Nedra Talley Ross. ``He's totally
cheated us for 35 years,'' said the 52-year-old Mrs. Ross, who runs
a restaurant and an importing business these days in Virginia
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Love, the rock diva whose classic ``(Today I Met) The Boy
I'm Going to Marry'' was a 1960s Phil Spector hit, is attending the
trial ``in a show of support'' for the Ronettes, she said from her
seat in Courtroom 205. She has known Mrs. Greenfield since 1962,
when they met at a Murray the K show at the Brooklyn Fox Theater.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't easy getting money out of rock 'n' roll icons. A jury
in New City gave Ms. Love a $260,000 judgment against Spector for
unpaid royalties last year, but the judge ordered it reduced to
$130,000; the judge's ruling is on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Others have sat in the audience to behold the sheer spectacle of
what they've called the ``Spector Show,'' notching a life sighting
of the man who was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in
1989. ``He's a go-see,'' said Don Chaisson, a video promoter from
Hempstead, of Spector. ``He rarely makes appearances.''
</P>
<P>
   Spector himself, during his testimony, summed up the story in a
phrase worthy of the Wall of Sound. ``It's so sad to see good love
go bad,'' he said.

RENO LIKELY TO AUTHORIZE LIMITED INQUIRY INTO KING ASSASSINATION
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno's aides have advised
her to go forward with a review of key pieces of evidence in the
assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King. But law enforcement
officials said they had no reason to believe that that James Earl
Ray was wrongly convicted of the murder, law enforcement officials
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has been under pressure from the family of the civil rights
leader to reexamine evidence in the case in light of more advanced
forensic techniques than those available in 1968 when King was
killed. These tests could be used to examine the bullet that killed
King and the rifle which bore fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   Reno met with advisers on Thursday in an effort to reach a
decision, which could be announced as early as Friday. After an
evening discussion, officials said, she seemed unlikely to
authorize the creation of the broad fact-finding body sought by the
King family and appeared to favor a much narrower inquiry into a
few details of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the effort to reexamine the case is a belief among some
of King's family members, including his widow, Coretta Scott King,
that Ray might not have acted alone. Mrs. King met with Reno in
April saying she had presented new evidence to the attorney
general, but did not elaborate on the nature of the information.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has left Justice Department officials in an awkward
spot. They are reluctant to avoid offending a prominent family with
powerful Democratic allies in Congress and the White House. Yet
Justice Department officials are unwilling to reopen the case and
remain skeptical that a fresh review would yield significant new
information.
</P>
<P>
   Most investigators who have examined the case in the 30 years
since King's death have long concluded that King was shot to death,
as he stood on the balconey of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, by a
single bullet fired from a deer rifle by Ray, a loner with powerful
racist motives.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, who died in April, was serving a 99-year sentence for the
1968 shooting. He confessed to the shooting and pleaded guilty, but
quickly recanted his confession. Until his death, he suggested that
a shadowy conspiracy, for which he offered no evidence, was behind
the killing.
</P>
<P>
   The most thorough examination of the case by the House Select
Committee on Assassinations, found that Ray fired the fatal shot
and that if co-conspirators existed they were probably limited to
family members and some racist militants in St. Louis who were
known the Ray family and had put a bounty on King's life.
</P>
<P>
   A recent book on the subject, ``Killing the Dream,'' by Gerald
Posner, which some reviewers said was a definitive study of the
assassination, found no credible evidence to support Ray's
contention that he was manipulated into a conspiracy, or that the
FBI or CIA covered up evidence in King's murder.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, a retired FBI agent said that he had found
two slips of paper in Ray's car that were said to bear the named
``Raul'' on them. One slip contained list of payments to
unidentified people and organizations. The FBI said the agent was
not part of the search team and dismissed the assertion as a
``total fabrication.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the case stirred such deep passions, that it has
never been fully brought to rest. Ray repeatedly tried and failed
to win a new trial, saying he was set up and that someone else
fired the fatal shot. During prison interviews he spoke of taking
orders from a man he identified as Raoul, or at other times as
Raul, whose identity has never been positively established.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the King family avoided being drawn into Ray's legal
maneuvering. But last year the King family began publicly voicing
doubts that Ray acted alone and Mrs. King, in an emotional court
proceeding pleaded with a federal judge to grant Ray a new trail.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of reexamining the case has divided some of King's
admirers. On one side were those who complained that the effort was
a said that waste of time, But Mrs. King had pleaded with the
federal courts to grant Ray a new trial as an opportunity to
examine new facts and explore the nature of racism that led to the
crime.

YANKEES AND METS FIGHT FOR CITY'S AFFECTION AND SUPPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BBO-NY-YANKS-METS) 
(JT) 
 By CLAIRE SMITH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Is New York City big enough for both the Yankees and
the Mets?
</P>
<P>
   Such a question would have once resulted in only the most
visceral, chest-thumping responses, the sort that will very much be
on display Friday night when the Yankees and Mets meet in
interleague play at a sold-out Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But these days the question has a deeper resonance and a less
clear-cut answer, as both teams pursue new, multimillion-dollar
stadiums amid what seems to be an increasingly intense competition
for the city's affection and fan base.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago may have the Cubs and the White Sox, southern California
the Dodgers and the Angels and the Bay area the Giants and the
Athletics, but none of those regional rivalries seem to have the
depth of New York's, where the turf war not only involves the
living, but also the ghosts of Yankees, Brooklyn Dodgers and Giants
teams of the past.
</P>
<P>
   And yet for all that history, and all the interest in the
upcoming series, the onus seems to be on the Mets these days to
prove that they still count, that they have not been permanently
pushed to the fringes by a Yankees team that revived the club's
long-dormant dynasty by winning it all in 1996, that is clearly the
best team in baseball right now and that has so many appealing
personalities that all the people who used to love to hate the
Yankees now are finding it harder to do so.
</P>
<P>
   No one understands the question hanging over the Mets better
than Fred Wilpon, one of the team's co-owners. Wilpon no longer
thinks all his club need do is win big, again, as it did on its way
to becoming world champions in 1986, to assure that the Yankees
become second fiddle, again, as they were when handily winning the
attendance wars between these two teams in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what would happen in the remainder of the '90s if
we both were terrific teams,'' said Wilpon, whose team is trying to
put the finishing touches on the transformation from terrible to
good. ``The dynamics of things change as the country and city
change. The city is different than it was five years ago. The
perception and reality of where people will go or won't go doesn't
exist in the same way, because of the perception that there is a
great deal more safety in the streets. We have the Giuliani
administration to thank for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I don't know what would happen if we were as good as the
Yankees right now. I have a feeling they would draw as many as we
would.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' appeal was not so much a problem for the Mets when
both teams set attendance records in 1988 that last to this day.
The Yankees' attendance that year reached 2.633 million tickets
sold; at the same time, the Mets were counting a record 3.05
million people coming through the turnstiles, which projects, says
National League President Leonard Coleman, to about 3.5 million to
3.6 million tickets sold. That means that in a strong season for
both teams _ the Mets won their division, the Yankees were
contenders _ nearly 6 million people paid to watch them play.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' attendance withered through much of the 1990s because
of bad play on the field, but even when the Mets made a quick
turnaround last season, they sold only 1,766,174 tickets and Shea
often seemed a lonely place to be. That, in turn, made the club
question its strategy of rebuilding without any marquee players,
but it never led them to question their territorial prerogative,
insists Wilpon who, unlike the Yankees' principal owner, George
Steinbrenner, isn't seeking to move, but merely rebuild, planning a
stadium with a retractable roof right in the shadow of Shea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never felt we were losing our grip, because the Yankees
have their fans and we have our fans, then there are those who will
go between when one or the other or both are good,'' Wilpon said.
``Lately, the Yankees have been great. Not good. Great. But that
doesn't mean they are taking our fans. It only meant that the fans
who also might come to us weren't coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, wary of too much disinterest, the Mets reversed a
conservative course and acquired All-Star catcher Mike Piazza on
May 22. Since then, attendance is up an average 14,786 tickets a
game, from 18,876 to 32,662, although this surge also reflects
warmer weather and the ending of the school year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what our fans were articulating before Piazza was,
`We'll come out if you win, but we'll come out stronger if you
increase the wins and have some marquee names,''' Mets General
Manager Steve Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Mets have to hope a victory or two over the Yankees will
continue the warming trend in a city they hope will always have
room for one more winner.

UTILITIES URGE SAVING POWER IN HOT MIDWEST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ohio, Ill., Wis.)   (af)  
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Utilities throughout the Midwest asked millions of customers
Thursday to cut the use of appliances, including air conditioners,
because of a heat wave that has resulted in a surge in demand for
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Major industries also reduced operations in the Midwest on
Thursday, canceling shifts or sending workers home early, to
conserve power.
</P>
<P>
   Most utilities have been able to avoid blacking out parts of
their service areas. But some utilities have warned that they will
impose blackouts if voluntary cuts in power use are insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Although a heat wave is the main cause of the power shortages,
they have been compounded by severe storms in recent days that
knocked out important transmission lines in Ohio. And many nuclear
power plants have been closed for the summer for maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   ``A serious electric power problem has developed,'' said
American Electric Power Co., a leading utility based in Columbus,
Ohio, in a warning to its 7.5 million customers in areas that cover
parts of seven states. Utilities in the region scrambled Thursday
to buy surplus power, causing prices to soar temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases power sold for $4,000 per megawatt hour, the
standard unit of measurement. Normally a megawatt hour sells for
$25 to $50.
</P>
<P>
   ``These prices are astronomical,'' said Jim Owen, a spokesman
for the Edison Electric Institute, a trade group for the utility
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Many major industrial customers in states like Ohio, Illinois
and Wisconsin complied with voluntary agreements made with their
utilities to reduce consumption in periods when demand outruns the
capacity of the utilities' power plants.
</P>
<P>
   LTV Corp., a steelmaker, closed a plant in Cleveland and reduced
production at others in the Midwest. Sun Oil Co. said it had shut
its refinery in Toledo, Ohio, because of storm damage to power
supply equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Warnings issued by ComEd, a utility that supplies 3.4 million
customers in northern Illinois, were typical of how Midwest
utilities sought to weather the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ComEd asked residential customers not to run major appliances
until after 7 p.m. It asked 300 of its large commercial customers
to cut back to save about 800 megawatts of power, which caused some
to shut operations for a shift.
</P>
<P>
   The utility also asked about 100 municipal governments to shut
off appliances and lights at buildings. Many complied.
</P>
<P>
   Don Kirchoffner, a spokesman for ComEd, said the voluntary cuts
and the purchase of power at high prices allowed the utility to get
through the day without shutting off power.
</P>
<P>
   Kirchoffner said the utility was forced to buy power from
outsiders, paying about $4 million for what normally would have
cost $100,000 to $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Cinergy, the parent of Cincinnati Gas &AMP; Electric Co., also
beseeched customers to conserve power, as did some utilities in
Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   John Procario, the vice president of the electric system of
Cinergy, said ``the growing demand could strain the system to the
point that we would need to implement rotating blackouts to prevent
a failure of the entire system.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts said the danger of major blackout was remote and
that the utilities will be able to get through.

   &UR; BILL'S WORLD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton says rural areas ``cannot rely on agriculture alone
to sustain their economy.'' Right. They also need a cafe with
homemade pies.
</P>
<P>
   ``American farmers have become so productive and so advanced,''
Mr. Clinton says, ``that agriculture should be considered another
high-tech industry.'' We'll watch for Winnows 98.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if watermelon is a fruit or vegetable,'' says Mr.
Clinton. ``I think it's something in between.'' One thing's sure _
watermelon is Democratic. The GOP has watermelone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come a long way from the days when Thomas Jefferson
thought every American should be a farmer,'' the president says.
Right. Now most Americans think they're Thomas Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   ``American agriculture,'' says Mr. Clinton, ``is one of our most
powerful export engines.'' Yes, but along with food off the farm,
could we also export some of the smell?
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know that our nation's core values in many ways have
their deepest roots in rural America,'' Mr. Clinton says. Like
``Watch where you step.''
</P>
<P>
   The president calls the Census ``the single most important
source of information about the American people.'' The Census? Not
Rush Limbaugh?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's likely I will run for president in the year 2000,'' Dan
Quayle says. No word what he'll do in 2001 and on.
</P>
<P>
   A national commission says America is becoming a ``nation of
spectators.'' Yes, and we're often willing to pay scalpers' prices

   &UR; HERE LIZARD, LIZARD &LR;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   As if the prospect of coexisting with tens of millions of pink,
sterile medflies were not daunting enough, we Floridians are now
being threatened by mobs of six-foot, tail-whipping iguanas.
</P>
<P>
   As is so often the case, this particular problem originated in
California. Back in the late '80s and early '90s, South American
green iguanas were considered trendy pets and were being imported
to this country by the tens of thousands. What people didn't
realize - and weren't told - was that the cute little lizards
quickly grow into dragon-size creatures that carry disease, tear up
the house and wield their heavy tails like broadswords
</P>
<P>
   Life is unpleasant enough in California what with earthquakes
and Starbucks and everything, so people began abandoning their pets
faster than you can say, ``Run for your life! Another bad Godzilla
movie!''
</P>
<P>
   Animal shelters were soon up to here with the little darlings
and stopped accepting castaways. Finding foster homes for
columnist-size creatures that run like a deer and have an annoying
habit of leaping through your screen door or pool cage has been no
easy matter, either.
</P>
<P>
   All of which would be nothing more than another good reason not
to visit Los Angeles were it not for the fact that iguanas are now
becoming a problem in Phoenix and, yes, Florida.
</P>
<P>
   If you are the kind of person who only ventures outside long
enough to hose the malathion off your car, then chances are good
that you will escape being impaled on the sharp tail of an angry
six-foot iguana, at least for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   But Florida is nothing if not conducive to biodiversity, so I
predict it will not be long before iguanas are thicker than love
bugs here, and considerably more trouble to scrape off your
windshield.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly we need some sort of long-term strategy, something more
clever and cunning than a bumper sticker campaign urging iguanas to
go back where they came from. (This didn't work with people from Up
North, so I see no reason why it would work on iguanas, which, from
what I've read, are even more cantankerous than New Yorkers, if you
can imagine such a thing.)
</P>
<P>
   One possible strategy - and it is not an appealing one, I admit
- is to simply learn to get along with the iguanas. According to
the Reuters story I read, iguanas get jumpy when they do not get
enough affection, and a jumpy iguana is the kind of iguana that
turns its owner into shish kebab. The story recommends that you
take your iguana into the shower with you as the mist is good for
the lizard's skin. The story did not say anything about bubble
baths, but I presume iguanas would like that, too, though you
probably ought to take care where you sit.
</P>
<P>
   While you are bathing with your iguana, you might want to engage
it in conversation, as that would help relax it, and a relaxed
iguana is less likely to poke a hole in your liver with its tail.
One thing you definitely want to avoid discussing is that iguanas
carry salmonella bacteria on their skin and are sometimes infested
with ticks. Iguanas do not respond well to having their personal
hygiene called into question, so you probably ought to talk about
something more innocuous, like the weather, unless you want to end
up like that unfortunate housewife in ``Terminator 2.''
</P>
<P>
   If possible, you might want to chat with your iguana about how
nice Central America is this time of year, as there is a chance
that will make it homesick for the jungles of its native Guatemala
or El Salvador or wherever it came from. Do not discuss any
political unrest that might be occurring in that region as iguanas
get fidgety when the talk turns to politics and a fidgety iguana is
an iguana that skewers your pancreas as if it were a martini olive.
</P>
<P>
   While you want to be affectionate with your iguana, you do not
want to be too affectionate because then the iguana will have no
reason to leave. For that reason, candlelight dinners are out, as
are foot rubs and back rubs.

BRUINS' BURNS, SAMSONOV HONORED BY LEAGUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The Bruins scored twice here Thursday night, with
Sergei Samsonov officially named the NHL's new kid on the block and
Pat Burns crowned again as king of the turnarounds.
</P>
<P>
   Samsonov, who began last season just days shy of his 19th
birthday, became the sixth Bruin to be named the league's Calder
Award winner as rookie of the year. And the 47-year-old Burns, who
only last May inherited a Bruins' team fresh off finishing dead
last in the standings, was named the Adams Award winner as coach of
the year, his third time capturing the award.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our Academy Awards,'' said a beaming Burns, who
earlier in the day said he was convinced that Dallas' Ken Hitchcock
would win the award. ``We've directed films all year long, and
there are stars of the movies...and you have the directors who are
coaches--it's almost like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Samsonov, near tears on the podium, rattled off the customary
list of thank yous, including his teammates, club managenent, even
his agent. He then gestured to his father and said, ``Dad, this
one's for you.'' Viktor Samsonov sat stoically in the crowd, his
sapphire eyes watering.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the one who brought me up to hockey,'' said Samsonov, the
first Bruin since Ray Bourque in 1980 to capture the Calder. ``He
helped me the most. He deserves it as much as I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns was the first Bostonian named coach of the year since Don
Cherry won it 1976. Cherry was also a runnerup in '78, as were Mike
Milbury in 1990 and Brian Sutter in '93. Burns won the Adams in '93
with the Maple Leafs and in '89 with the Canadiens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was question of, I think, they needed leadership,'' said
Burns, referring to his arrival in Boston last spring. ``I was
fortunate to have Ray Bourque there for his leadership, but I think
the players were looking for other leadership, too, and that came
from me, Jacques Laperriere and Bobby Francis.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns was a busy man earlier in the week when the Bruins'
protected list for today's expansion draft was made public. Two
players he helped steer to the Bruins as free agents last summer,
Dave Ellett and Ken Baumgartner, were left left unprotected for the
draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of them called me and wanted to know what was up,'' said
Burns. ``I told them I didn't know, but I'd find out and get back
to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns said he then promptly called Boston general manager Harry
Sinden and assistant GM Mike O'Connell for an explanation. He was
told, esssentially, that business was business and the Bruins were
opting to protect younger players, including the likes of Darren
Van Impe and Landon Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked Mike and Harry to call both of them and explain it,''
said Burns. ``I think (Baumgartner and Ellett) both understand it's
a business, but I think it was important for them to have it
explained to them, that's all. I didn't know it was coming. I said,
`Guys, I don't know, but I'll look into it.'''
</P>
<P>
   It's highly unlikely that either Ellett or Baumgartner will be
taken in the draft. The Predators are expected to take checking
center Mike Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what free agents he thinks the Bruins might persue this
summer, beginning next week, Burns said any coach would like to
have the likes of Doug Gilmour or Ron Francis--two of the premier
unrestricted free agents available--on his roster. However, Burns
didn't sound as if either Gilmour or Francis would be heading to
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me a long time ago, `You'll have to do the best with
the guy you have,''' said Burns. ``And, hey, that's fine, I accept
that. We have a good bunch of guys and I wouldn't want to see that
chemistry changed. There are bargains and bandits in free agency,
and you have to look out for the bandits.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo's superstar goalie, Dominik Hasek, won the Hart Trophy
as the league's MVP for the second straight season--the first
goalie to take the award in consecutive seasons. The star of the
gold-medal-winning Czech Olympic team also won his fourth Vezina
Trophy in five years, again chosen the game's top netminder. The
Kings' Rob Blake won the Norris Trophy as the game's top
defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas right wing Jere Lehtinen was the Selke Trophy winner as
the game's top checker. St. Louis netminder Jamie McLennan won the
Masterton Award, for perseverance and sportsmanship, battling back
after a life-threatening bout of bacterial meningitis.
</P>
<P>
   Samsonov, with 43 of 54 first-place votes, bested a field that
included fellow finalists Mattias Ohlund (D, Vancouver) and Patrik
Elias (F, New Jersey). Burns collected 48 of 87 first-place votes,
finsihing ahead of Larry LA's Larry Robinson and Hitchcock.

BOEING PREPARES FOR NEW ASSEMBLY LINE IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KAREN WEST  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ As part of its preparations to establish a new
assembly line in California, Boeing is sending by rail a mock-up
fuselage section of its longest 737 aircraft from its factory in
Wichita, Kan.,to Long Beach, according to an internal company memo
to managers.
</P>
<P>
   While a final decision has not yet been made on the California
assembly line, the experimental train trip is being conducted to
make sure the 125-foot-long 737-900 fuselage isn't too big for the
route and to determine how long the journey will take.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like any project of this scope, there are certain steps we
need to take in order to prove the feasibility of the project and
protect our ability to move ahead,'' Fred Mitchell, Boeing's
executive vice president for airplane production said in a June 22
company bulletin sent to managers. ``In a sense, we are buying
insurance so that if we do make the decision to locate an
additional next-generation 737 line at Long Beach, we can do so
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing officials are hoping the ``simulated rail-car
transfers,'' which will be made in the next few weeks, will help
them decide whether it makes good business sense to create a new
production line to build certain 737 models at its Douglas Products
Division. Because it's a new model, another fuselage mock-up _ a
wooden shell of the aircraft's body section _ also will be sent by
rail to Boeing's Renton factory, where the 737 and 757 airplanes
are currently built.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure everything goes smoothly,'' Boeing
spokesman Sean O'Donnell said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also is preparing for the new line by clearing out an
aircraft production bay now used to build MD-11 jets at the Long
Beach factory. In addition, the company is upgrading the assembly
area, installing electrical power supplies and appointing teams to
head up 737 production work at the Southern California plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get a sense of space and proportions,'' O'Donnell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing announced in May that it is sending some 737 aircraft to
its Douglas Products Division for finishing work.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the company said its Renton aircraft factory was
overloaded with work and that it had nearly run out of room to
build all of its 737 models there.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing hasn't been able to keep up with demand for its
airplanes, and as a result, many of its airline customers have been
left waiting impatiently to take delivery of their jets, mainly the
next-generation 737 models.
</P>
<P>
   The plan to shift finishing work, and a study to establish a new
737 assembly line in California has had leaders of Boeing's largest
union threatening legal action or a possible strike when their
contract expires in December 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Johnson, president of District Lodge 751 of the
International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers in
Seattle, has said he would do everything he could to prevent 737
assembly from moving to Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   But after a meeting earlier this month with Boeing Chairman Phil
Condit and other company executives, Johnson said he would hold off
on recommending legal action or walkouts as long as dialogue with
the company continues.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, whose union represents 39,000 Boeing workers, could not
be reached for comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, leaders of the separate United Aerospace Workers
union at the underused Long Beach commercial jet factory, which
employs about 10,000 people, welcomes the move.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said a decision on the new assembly line will be made
in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   The company has said that the Long Beach plant ``can provide
some relief because we don't have enough people or space for all
the work.''
</P>
<P>
   If a 737 assembly line were established in California, it would
focus on final assembly of airplanes such as the Boeing Business
Jet and the cargo version of the jet, which have significantly
different configurations from the next generation 737s ordered by
most airline customers. In addition, Boeing would consider doing
assembly work on the 737-900 model in Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the decision, Mitchell said Boeing will still use
its Renton factory as the primary final assembly location for 737
and 757 airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   In an inhouse memo sent to managers last month, Boeing said that
a new next-generation 737 assembly line in Long Beach would account
for about 17 percent of the production hours for each 737 built
there.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the work _ such as wings, fuselage, aircraft systems
and interiors _ would continue to be done at Boeing facilities by
members of the local Machinists union.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing announced earlier this year that it will phase out
production of the MD-80, MD-90 and MD-11 airplanes, leaving only
the Boeing 717 _ formerly the MD-95 _ left at the California plant.
</P>
<P>
   If the company goes ahead with a new production line in Long
Beach, it would be the first time Boeing has ever established
commercial aircraft
</P>
<P>
   final-assembly operations outside the Puget Sound area.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing inherited the Long Beach factory when it acquired
McDonnell Douglas last year in a $16.3 billion stock deal.

RESTORED `GONE WITH THE WIND' BREATHES NEW LIFE INTO AN EPIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The real all-time box-office champ is returning
to theaters, and there isn't an iceberg anywhere to be found.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Titanic'' may be the top domestic grosser at $585
million, its total of tickets sold is not even half that of ``Gone
With the Wind.'' Based on admissions, the 1939 epic has brought in
an inflation-adjusted total of $1.3 billion. The second-highest,
``Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,'' trails by nearly $300 million,
Variety estimated earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   A lavishly restored version of the Civil War romance will open
at more than 200 theaters today, with one-third more image than
what most moviegoers have experienced and a remastered digital
soundtrack. Chances are good that the 59-year-old film can move up
several notches on the all-time list of unadjusted grosses, where
it is now 25th with $191.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   It was No. 1 for more than two decades until ``Sound of Music''
bumped it off in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``Gone With the Wind'' contains a dozen minutes of
digitally restored footage, including the memorable scene just
before intermission in which Vivien Leigh pulls a radish out of the
ground at sunset and vows, ``As God is my witness, I'll never be
hungry again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got great characters and huge backgrounds, so if it's
projected on a 40-feet screen, it needs to be in pristine
condition,'' said Greg Granello, president of EDS Digital, which
performed the digital restoration. ``I think audiences will be
amazed because it really brings you back to the theatrical
experience and what kind of movie it takes to carry an audience
away.''
</P>
<P>
   The re-release includes a revival of Technicolor's dye-transfer
process in the original height and width. And it comes in the sunny
afterglow of 1997's amazing performance of ``Star Wars,'' which
prompted Ted Turner to suggest late last year that New Line Cinema
make use of the latest technology for a revamped ``Gone With the
Wind.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Star Wars'' trilogy pulled in a stunning quarter-billion
dollars domestically after a massive publicity blitz over new
digital scenes. 20th Century Fox, eager to impress George Lucas and
secure rights to future ``Star Wars'' films, booked showings in
more than 2,000 theaters for each film.
</P>
<P>
   New Line has more modest ambitions. It hopes to shift prints
from big-city markets to smaller towns as the summer wears on,
keeping ``Gone With the Wind'' playing in about 200 locales through
August.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine that the most frequent moviegoers will
choose ``Gone With the Wind'' over, say, ``Armageddon,'' ``The
X-Files'' or ``Dr. Dolittle'' because reissues are tricky. Disney
has generated solid business with a handful of animated reissues
that appear every few years such as ``Snow White,'' ``The Little
Mermaid'' and ``101 Dalmatians.''
</P>
<P>
   But in most cases, studios usually limit themselves to a few
venues in major markets with 50 to 100 screens nationwide for a
month. Universal pulled in $1.7 million from a restored ``Vertigo''
in 1996; Paramount grossed a similar amount from a 25th-anniversary
release of ``The Godfather'' last year.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Schlessinger, director of repertory sales at Sony
Pictures, believes that keeping the screen count fairly low for a
re-release makes sense. ``I'm very excited to see it, and I think
New Line's approach is really smart,'' he said. ``A `Star Wars'
reissue is a phenomenon that occurs only once or twice a century.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the movie was released by MGM, it is now owned by Time
Warner Inc. It became Turner's property in the mid-'80s as part of
his purchase of MGM's library. Turner re-released ``Gone With the
Wind'' with a restored soundtrack in 1988 and sold his entire
company to Time Warner in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   New Line has been promoting the film with appearances by Olivia
De Havilland, the last surviving major cast member. Although New
Line had not timed the release to come after ``Titanic,'' it may
have lucked out just the same.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Titanic' may have paved the way for the younger generation
to accept a romance played out against the backdrop of world
events,'' said Mitch Goldman, New Line's distribution and marketing
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success of `Titanic' augurs very well for `Gone With the
Wind,' '' agreed Kevin Skislock, an analyst with L.H. Friend,
Weinress, Presson &AMP; Frankson in Irvine. ``Both are very
story-driven, with a very historical background; believable,
sympathetic characters; and a touching love story.''

SO MUCH FOR SOCCER KICK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems most important that ABC continues to get the word out
about the new kickoff time for ``Monday Night Football'' during its
coverage of World Cup '98.
</P>
<P>
   At least it had its priorities straight as to what kind of
football whets the Americans' TV appetite.
</P>
<P>
   As France bids adieu to those Losing Ugly Americans who capsized
quickly in pool play, with them likely goes any further interest in
the rest of the tournament by the casual U.S. television sports
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Which is like saying the Mojave Desert will go another day
without rain.
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA has been getting better ratings than World Cup coverage
the last two weeks. The Disney three-headed monster (ABC, ESPN and
ESPN2), which paid twice as much ($25 million) for the U.S.
broadcasting rights in '98 than it did in '94, is seeing half the
viewing audience from four years ago when the circus came to the
U.S. mainland. Spanish-language Univision is averaging about
170,000 more households per day than ESPN during the regular
midweek games.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever that all means, they're just the facts, ma'am. Whether
this action/suspense series has been better or the story lines more
glamorous, what plays loudest to the TV comb-overs is the two
numbers separated by a decimal point, provided by people with
little boxes on the back of their sets.
</P>
<P>
   Completely opposite to New York-stuck studio cohort Brent
Musburger, ABC's World Cup play-by-play man Bob Ley can hardly be
accused of catching the infectious media homerism during the
tournament. That's both a blessing and a curse.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. ``Outside the Lines'' maintains his journalistic standards.
But isn't this supposed to be the sport where passion takes over?
</P>
<P>
   Ley, who tends to believe American indifference is exaggerated,
expresses major disappointment in how soccer has played in the
states based on the U.S. team's three-losses-and-out performance.
But that opinion comes off-camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a results-oriented business,'' Ley said Wednesday night
from the press box in Lens, France, hours before he and Seamus
Malin did the Spain-Bulgaria match for ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd encourage anyone to expand their thinking about the
development of U.S. Soccer. It was a rude awakening for a lot of
people _ the coaches, the fans, the media. This country has a lot
of growing up to do as a soccer nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will the American society be comfortable with that reality? I
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Ley doesn't seem to be.
</P>
<P>
   He only hinted at those feelings during Thursday's
U.S.-Yugoslavia telecast. Malin, as was his job, was a bit more
subjective, but came nowhere close to the Dick Vitale enthusiasm
that makes this country's NCAA basketball tournament so much more
invigorating.
</P>
<P>
   Musburger, meanwhile, just continues shilling. He'll be taking
tickets at Paris' Euro-Disney next week.
</P>
<P>
   As Ley and Malin continue their own Tour de France, doing games
from seven of the 10 sites over the course of the tournament, it
becomes more apparent to them that a U.S.-less Cup tournament
translates to a black hole in TV programming.

PENTAGON ADVISER CRITICIZES TECHNOLOGY EXPORT CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A senior Pentagon adviser Thursday accused the
Clinton administration of diminishing the Pentagon's role in
safeguarding sensitive American technology exports in favor of
commercial interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``What passes for an export control system has been hijacked by
longtime ideological opponents of the very concept of export
controls,'' said Peter Leitner, a senior trade adviser to the
agency for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   While a senior Pentagon official denied Leitner's charges made
at a Senate hearing Thursday, he acknowledged the government could
improve the way it handles exports of technology that have both
commercial and military applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a balance, and we have to continue to make that
balance,'' Franklin Miller, a principal deputy assistant secretary
of defense told a hearing of the Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's hearing, a spinoff of the multipronged congressional
inquiry into whether China obtained sensitive technology that
helped its ballistic missiles, focused on an important, but little
known Pentagon bureaucracy, the Defense Technology Security
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is responsible for preventing the unauthorized
transfer of sensitive technical information and technology, such as
communication satellites and supercomputers, to other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Leitner, the hearing's main witness, accused the administration
of ``neutering'' the Pentagon agency's role by hiring inexperienced
and poorly trained staff, rubber-stamping export licenses on scant
technical information and stifling dissent from career officials
like himself.
</P>
<P>
   But Miller took issue with virtually every one of Leitner's
criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   Leitner, for example, had offered charts that indicated a sharp
decline after 1995 in the percentage of cases of ``dual-use''
technology export cases that the agency had referred to the Defense
Intelligence Agency and the armed services for review of sensitive
technology.
</P>
<P>
   But Miller said the decline coincided with a new policy that
required the Commerce Department to refer all dual-use applications
to the Pentagon agency for review, not just those that Commerce
deemed necessary. So the volume of cases rose.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, Miller said the charge that the agency had
been marginalized was ''nonsense,'' and then described fierce,
internal administration debates over loosening exports controls on
technology like satellites, as examples of full Pentagon
participation.
</P>
<P>
   But that defense did not persuade the committee chairman, Sen.
Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., who said, ``Commercial interests have had a
bigger play than they should have.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Also on Capitol Hill, other congressional committees debated the
merits of the administration's China policies.
</P>
<P>
   In a lift for President Clinton, the House Ways and Means
Committee approved by voice vote Clinton's decision to renew
China's trade status and urged lawmakers to reject calls to sever
normal trading relations with Beijing. The measure now goes to the
full House.
</P>
<P>
   In another House hearing, two major rocket motor makers
testified that a policy started by President Ronald Reagan to allow
American satellite companies to launch their satellites in foreign
countries was hurting the American launching industry as well as
helping foreign militaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``A loss of satellite launching business to foreign competitors
diminishes companies that support the U.S. strategic deterrent,
while at the same time subsidizing the development of a foreign
capability,'' Paul Ross, a group vice president of Alliant
Techsystems, a rocket-motor maker in Hopkins, Minn., told the House
Science Committee.
</P>
<P>
   At the same hearing, a former McDonnell Douglas aerospace
engineer, Leon McKinney, confirmed what many scientists had been
saying on Capitol Hill for weeks: ``If you improve launch-vehicle
guidance technology.'' The launch-vehicle technology guides rockets
carrying satellites.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying fear in any unauthorized technology transfer to
the Chinese is that it helped improve the reliability of Beijing's
nuclear missiles. The Clinton administration insists this has not
been the result of any licensed technology exports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could American companies simply by asking questions in the
right way upgrade Chinese capability?'' asked Rep. Dana
Rohrabacher, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most probably,'' said McKinney, who is now an independent
aerospace consultant in Missouri.

<P>
   Who says economics is the dismal science? OK, OK: just about
everybody. Who but an economist, after all, would insist that
unemployment can ever be too low or that the stock market can ever
be too high?
</P>
<P>
   But nobody ever accused the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas of
spreading doom and gloom. Indeed, the Dallas Fed is probably best
known for a study showing that poverty in America is largely a
statistical misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not surprisingly, that take on poverty never passed
muster with the gatekeepers of the economics establishment. But the
same researchers, W. Michael Cox and Richard Alm, are at it again.
And this time the good-news guys are apt to raise fewer hackles
with their paean to the virtues of technological change and
productivity growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time Well Spent: The Declining Real Cost of Living in
America,'' an essay by Cox and Alm that is part of the Dallas Fed's
1997 annual report, is short on hard-core analysis. But the
then-and-now statistical comparisons, showing how much more the
average American can now buy with so much less effort, are loads of
fun to check out.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the Dallas Fed economists are not the first to
take issue with the idea that prices are far higher today than they
were, say, a century ago. Indeed, the argument about long-term
price comparisons is well-known to Econ 101 students as the Sears
Catalog Paradox.
</P>
<P>
   If prices are really so much higher today, the premise goes, it
follows that most people would prefer to spend $1,000 on goods from
a century-old Sears Catalog at 1898 prices than go on a $1,000
shopping spree for today's goods at today's prices.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, most people would choose the other option. While it
would be nice to be able to buy a pound of nails or a dozen spools
of cotton thread for a few pennies from the old catalog, hardly
anyone would want to own the primitive sewing machines or bicycles
from the 1898 catalog at any price. (For the sake of this
discussion, set aside their value as collectibles.)
</P>
<P>
   Besides, many of the things that make life pleasant, even
bearable, simply weren't for sale in 1898. ``No amount of income
would make my life better if I couldn't buy my arthritis drugs,''
pointed out Paul Krugman, an economist at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, noted Krugman, the author of ``The Accidental
Theorist'' (Norton), the Sears Catalog Paradox misses part of the
point because it looks backward rather than forward. While no
amount of money could buy the variety and quality of goods in 1898
that Americans take for granted in 1998, staples _ food and shelter
_ certainly have risen in price since the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Brad DeLong, an economist at the University of California at
Berkeley, puts it another way. As new, improved products come
along, he notes, ``the rich substitute out of whatever luxury goods
they were consuming like bandits.'' But a peasant in, say, Haiti,
would happily give up access to anti-skid automobile brakes or
three-dimensional computer games that he can't possibly afford in
return for rice, cooking oil and shoes at 1898 prices.
</P>
<P>
   Cox and Alm don't mess around with such ambiguities. They have a
simpler point to make _ namely, that ``the real cost of living
isn't measured in dollars and cents but in hours and minutes we
must work to live.''
</P>
<P>
   And by this yardstick, living has become a lot easier. Consider
that staple of modern life, the television set. Back in 1971, the
average worker had to toil 174 hours to earn enough money for a
25-inch color receiver. In 1997, a much more reliable TV cost just
23 hours on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Or consider the 3-pound chicken that every American used to put
in his pot before Pizza Hut opened at the mall. That chicken cost
$3.15 in 1997, almost triple the price in 1919. But it took the
average worker just 15 minutes to earn that chicken, compared with
158 minutes in 1919.
</P>
<P>
   What has happened, of course, is that technology, education and
machinery have made workers far more productive than their
counterparts of 20, 50 or 100 years ago. Mass-produced bits of
silicon have replaced exquisitely formed (yet short-lived) vacuum
tubes in TVs. And chickens, which used to scratch out a living
behind the barn, are now scientifically assembled from vegetable
protein and antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   About the only items that have become more expensive in terms of
work time are movie tickets and college degrees. But in both cases,
the Dallas Fed economists assure us, the product has been improved.
</P>
<P>
   Who, after all, would rather watch a bunch of actors in shades
of gray when they could watch Godzilla take a bite out of the
Empire State Building in glorious Surroundsound? And who could
resent the $150,000 price tag of an Ivy League education that lands
them a ticket on the Wall Street gravy train?
</P>
<P>
   If Cox and Alm had stopped about here, few would be inclined to
quibble. But they cannot resist tossing in a bit of ideology. This
life-enhancing bounty of the modern economy, they contend, depends
on the wide differences in living standards between rich and poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without society's wealthy, fewer new goods and services would
find their way to the rest of us,'' they write. ``Far from being a
blight on society,'' they add, ``unequal income distribution is
instrumental in driving society forward. It's a natural resource.''
</P>
<P>
   Marie Antoinette couldn't have said it better.

COURT TOPPLES LINE-ITEM VETO; MCCAIN VOWS TO REWORK LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court struck down on Thursday what Sen.
John McCain had hoped would be part of his legacy: a law giving the
president expanded veto power to harness ``pork-barrel'' spending
by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In a 6-3 decision, the court declared unconstitutional a
McCain-sponsored law giving the president authority to wipe out
wasteful programs contained in larger spending bills. Before the
law's enactment in 1996, the president could veto an entire
spending measure but not individual items.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled that such a specialized veto can be authorized
only through a constitutional amendment.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain, R-Ariz., and other line-item veto backers, vowed to
push instead for a slightly different measure in Congress that,
this time, would pass constitutional muster.
</P>
<P>
   Several senators feared the court's ruling would usher in a new
era of the sort of bloated, special-interest spending that Congress
was long known for _ such projects as microbreweries, boat marinas
and other ``pork.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This defeat means that we will return and retreat to the
practice of loading up otherwise necessary legislation with
pork-barrel spending,'' said Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind. ``The Supreme
court has resurrected a pig, or pork, that we thought was dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision was a defeat for McCain, who forced a vote
on a line-item veto nearly every year for a decade until its
approval two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to point out that it's been a wonderful two weeks for
me,'' a droll McCain told reporters after the decision. ``I haven't
had quite this much fun since I was last interrogated in Hanoi.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a former prisoner of war in Vietnam, lost his bid to
pass a sweeping anti-tobacco bill last week and was criticized for
telling a crude joke at a fund-raiser about the president's
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the line-item veto by the Senate after so many
failures had been considered one of the crowning achievements of
McCain's career. House Republicans made the line-item veto a part
of their Contract with America, the agenda they credited for
electing a GOP majority to Congress in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But the court said the law violates that part of the
Constitution requiring every bill to be presented to the president
for his approval or veto. The court said the Constitution does not
allow for what, in effect, are partial vetoes.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the court, Justice John Paul Stevens cited the
``profound importance'' of the issue and said that ``the procedures
authorized by the line-item veto act are not authorized by the
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is to be a new procedure in which the president will
play a different role in determining the text of what may become a
law, such change must come not by legislation but through the
amendment procedures set forth in Article V of the Constitution,''
Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens was joined in his opinion by Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, David Souter, Clarence
Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who is a former Arizona state
lawmaker, dissented, along with Antonin Scalia and Stephen Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   The law was challenged by New York City and an Idaho potato
growers' group after President Clinton vetoed provisions they
sought. &QL;

MIATA CLUB HOLDS ANNUAL MEETING IN POCONO MOUNTAINS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 28) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa., Del.)   (af)  
 By MICHELLE KREBS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first redesign of the Mazda Miata sports car since it was
introduced in 1989 has helped make the Miata Club of America's
annual gathering this week in the Pocono Mountains of Eastern
Pennsylvania a sellout.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 owners of the two-seat roadsters from the United
States, Canada and Europe will descend on the Split Rock Resort in
Lake Harmony to speed around the Pocono Raceway, caravan through
winding mountain roads, participate in road-rally scavenger hunts
and shop for accessories sold by the companies that are acting as
sponsors, including Michelin and Mazda's marketing arms in Canada
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more excitement for the event this year because the
new car has just come out,'' said Dave Thomas, the organizer of
Miata Mountain Madness and a former president of the Delaware
Valley Miata Club, the host of the event.
</P>
<P>
   Vince Tidwell, the president of the Miata Club of America, said
of the club's eighth annual convention: ``This is about as big as
it gets. ``It's not bigger because we are limited in the number of
people who can attend.''
</P>
<P>
   From bank executives to United Parcel Service drivers, the
thread linking those who will gather in the Poconos from June 30 to
July 3 is ownership of a Miata. Some are young professionals; most
are in their mid-40s with children who are already grown.
</P>
<P>
   Many, like Thomas, an executive at a Philadelphia direct-mail
company, are former owners of the British sports cars after which
the highly successful Miata was patterned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I owned a Triumph Spitfire as a teen-ager, and a lot of the
club members owned MGs and Alfa Romeos,'' said Thomas, who lives in
Gulph Mills, Pa., and owns one of the 350 Laguna blue and tan
Miatas that were made in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Miata offers the same kind of fun as those British sports
cars but without the oil spot in your driveway,'' he said,
referring to the notoriously unreliable vehicles of an earlier
generation. ``And it cranks up every time you turn it on, unlike
some of the British cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Formed on Nov. 1, 1987, the Miata Club of America existed even
before there was a car or a name for the car then known to be under
development at Mazda. Since then, more than 65,000 people have been
members. There are 25,000 people on the rolls now.
</P>
<P>
   The $29-a-year membership fee covers a subscription to Miata
magazine, which is filled with advertising for Miata products like
tires, wheels, car covers and floor mats.
</P>
<P>
   While this week's convention has a lengthy list of scheduled
activities, most people come to socialize. ``This is largely a
social club that brings people from all walks of life together
because of this little car,'' Thomas said. &QL;

NBA draft results in agony and ecstasy
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two things were clear after the NBA draft Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   First, few people were happier than the Rockets after taking
their three first-round selections. They literally danced in their
war room when they saw how the picks in front of them unfolded,
leaving their prime choices on the board.
</P>
<P>
   Second, few people were sadder than the high schoolers, present
and future.
</P>
<P>
   While the Rockets rejoiced in their good fortune and their
tireless evaluation of talent that yielded Michael Dickerson, Bryce
Drew and Mirsad Turkcan, high schoolers Al Harrington, Rashard
Lewis and Korleone Young _ and perhaps a legion of future prep
stars weighing the NBA as an option to college _ were sent a
tough-love message by the league: Stay in school for at least one
year of college.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington was the only high school player taken in the first
round, chosen 25th by the Indiana Pacers. Lewis, the Elsik High
School standout, went at No. 32 to the Seattle SuperSonics. Young
was the last of the trio taken, going 40th to Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was the third pick of the second round, Young the 11th.
That means the money they sought by jumping from high school to the
pros won't be guaranteed. Only first-rounders sign guaranteed
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this doesn't get the message across to them, nothing
will,'' said NBA scout Marty Blake.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Harrington and Lewis were projected as solid first-round
material. But team after team _ including the Rockets _ passed on
the teen-agers to take players who had college experience or
Europeans who have played professionally.
</P>
<P>
   It might not stem the tide of players who try to make the jump
to the pros from high school. But it might be the start of the
pendulum swinging back toward the top high school players going to
college, even if for just one year of seasoning.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' case was particularly difficult. He was flown to the
draft by the NBA with the expectation he would be shaking hands
with David Stern at the podium as a first-round pick. Then, he
proceeded to say he felt betrayed by the hometown Rockets, thinking
they had given him assurances they would draft him with one of
their three first-round selections.
</P>
<P>
   All that did was compound the tough situation. Lewis is too
young and too talented to burn bridges with any team, let alone the
one that scouted him as much as any in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets did what they thought was best for their team. Their
three first-rounders, along with second-round pick Cuttino Mobley,
left them thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second leg of their offseason renovation of the
roster. The only sure holdovers from last season appear to be
Hakeem Olajuwon and Charles Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   The first maneuver was to get two extra first-round draft picks
for Kevin Willis in a trade with Toronto. Now, the Rockets have
used those picks to the best of the team's ability.
</P>
<P>
   Their next task will be to dive into free agency Wednesday, or
whenever the NBA's dicey labor situation is resolved. It is likely
the league will lock out the players Wednesday, meaning no teams
can sign or have contact with free agents or their agents.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Rockets are expected to make a splash, with
perhaps as much as $10 million available under the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen, Tom Gugliotta, Kevin Johnson, Rod Strickland,
Damon Stoudamire, Jayson Williams, Antonio McDyess, Cedric
Ceballos, LaPhonso Ellis and Joe Smith are some of the top free
agents available.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets cannot talk to or about free agents until Wednesday
or whenever the lockout is lifted. But Pippen is believed to be No.
1 on their wish list.
</P>
<P>
   If the Rockets have as much luck in free agency as they did in
the draft, Pippen should be a Rocket before training camp.

FOR YOUTH-OR-BUST KNICKS, OAKLEY IS NO. 1 VICTIM 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Marcus Camby is not known for breezing by in
olive-colored shoes with a Derby to match or for retrieving a loose
ball three rows back. He is not one to mangle metaphors, jumble
cliches or mix it up with an elbow.
</P>
<P>
   He is not Charles Oakley at all. Not in style, effort or
attitude. And the Knicks have decided Oakley is not their type
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   It's youth or bust now. The Knicks traded Oakley's savvy and
heart to Toronto for the athletic ability and unfulfilled potential
of Camby in a deal that was completed late Wednesday night.
Acquiring Camby does not fill the Knicks' most urgent need _ point
guard. So the team could still use Camby in a deal to secure that
position in the next week.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Knicks are claiming the 24-year-old Camby as their
own after giving the cash-poor Raptors their 44th pick in the
draft, Sean Marks, and an eye-catching $5 million to help offset
the $10 million that Oakley is scheduled to receive as a balloon
payment in the last year of his deal.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a trade that was welcomed by all within the Knicks'
organization. Although Patrick Ewing, who benefited from the
barbed-wire protection he received courtesy of the aggressive
Oakley for 10 years, gave his OK for the deal, there were those who
questioned whether it was wise to disrupt the makeup of the club by
sending their role player away.
</P>
<P>
   The anxiety of this decision was not lost on the Knicks' brain
trust. But one thing kept them focused on Camby. There was the
Indiana series, and the lasting images of how a tandem of young and
athletic forwards _ Antonio Davis and Dale Davis _ left the Knicks
looking more outdated than ever before as they bowed out in the
second round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What drove this was, `Are we a step behind or a step ahead of
Indiana?' I asked Jeff and Ernie this question,'' said Dave
Checketts, the president of Madison Square Garden, referring to
Coach Jeff Van Gundy and the team president Ernie Grunfeld. ``As
much as Knick fans are going to miss Oak, they have to ask
themselves that question, too. We agonized over this decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the decision was also contract related. Oakley made it
no secret that he wanted to re-sign for another three or four years
after his deal expired next year, leaving the Knicks in a situation
where they would have had to pay a 35-year-old forward in the
sunset of his career. Camby, who also has a year left on his deal,
gives the Knicks more options for the future. And more flexibility
on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the trade changes the image of a team that has been to
the playoffs each of the 10 years that Oakley was there to grab
rebounds and strike fear into anyone foolish enough to look for an
easy layup. Oakley was the Knicks' interior defense enforcer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the trade injects some youth and flexibility,'' Buck
Williams said. ``But I think that with Oak gone, the Knicks can't
be looked at as this hard-nosed, bump-and-grind, dive-on-the-floor
type of team anymore. That image was carved from what Oak did.
Charles Oakley is irreplaceable.''
</P>
<P>
   Camby has to forge his own identity. He will arrive as the
former second-overall pick in the 1996 draft out of UMass with a
trail of off-the-court problems. When he was a student, Camby
violated National Collegiate Athletic Association rules when he
accepted cash and gifts from an agent. Last summer, he was charged
with possessing a small amount of marijuana, a charge that was
later dropped.
</P>
<P>
   In a turbulent two years in Toronto, Camby alternately wowed and
disappointed those with high expectations of him. The
6-foot-11-inch Camby has been fragile, missing more than 15 games
each season with foot and ankle injuries. And while the Knicks
intend to add weight to his spindly frame, it is likely that Larry
Johnson will move over to power forward, while Camby fills the
small forward position.
</P>
<P>
   Camby gives the team a jolt of energy, fresh legs and someone
who can take off in the open court. He adds speed to a team of
plodders. And he is a shot-blocking force who led the league with
230 blocked shots this season. Other than this, his other numbers
were down from his rookie year. He averaged 12.1 points a game,
shot 41 percent from the field and 61 percent from the line.
</P>
<P>
   It was a curious downswing from a player that has been viewed as
unmotivated by some general managers in the league. But maybe it
was the environment of losing in Toronto that dampened Camby's
finesse game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes young players longer to develop in certain
situations,'' Grunfeld said. ``He was in a situation where the team
was losing in Toronto. We want to put him in a good environment,
around veteran leadership and get the most of out him.''
</P>
<P>
   The very veteran who could help Camby's most would have been
Oakley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate it so bad for him,'' Oakley's mother, Corine, said when
phoned at her home in Cleveland. ``He'll be disappointed, I know.
But he'll be fine. He'll adjust. He'll say something like,
`whatever ... nothin' you can do,' and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We would never give up a guy who has done so much for this
team and is still a very capable player to trade for someone we
didn't feel could help us win now,'' Van Gundy said. ``We're not
about winning down the future. So I don't think this is about
potential.'' &QL;

TEACHER FIRED FOR PRAYING IN CLASS BECOMES A CAUSE CELEBRE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Texas)   (bl)  
 By JACQUES STEINBERG with MACARENA HERNANDEZ   c.1998 N.Y. Times
News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The dismissal of Mildred Rosario would seem to be
clear cut.
</P>
<P>
   A substitute public school teacher in the Bronx, Ms. Rosario
readily admitted to school officials that she had led her sixth
graders in prayer on June 8, asking ``if anyone would like to
accept Jesus as their savior'' and then laying her hands on their
foreheads.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Education saw this as a clear violation of the
separation of church and state and dismissed her four days later.
As a temporary worker, she was not entitled to the lengthy
disciplinary process mandated by the contract with the teachers'
union.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Rosario has since emerged as an unlikely cause celebre,
drawing the attention of not only religious-minded parents and
clerical leaders in New York City but also House Speaker Newt
Gingrich and the conservative Rutherford Institute, which
underwrote Paula Jones' suit against President Clinton and is
offering to fund any legal action Ms. Rosario may pursue.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, House Majority Whip Tom DeLay convened a news
conference on Capitol Hill attended by Ms. Rosario and other House
members to condemn her dismissal. Later, at a closed-door meeting
of House members known as the Values Action Team, Gingrich spoke of
Ms. Rosario's plight as ``important,'' DeLay's spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Gingrich's office said that while he was ``not
familiar with the details of this case,'' the speaker believed that
``praying'' was not an ``appropriate reason'' for a teacher to be
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   However much the letter of the law may be on its side, the Board
of Education has touched a raw nerve among those who feel that the
barriers against bringing religion into the classroom have been
maintained with far too much rigidity.
</P>
<P>
   But parents, politicians and others who support Ms. Rosario say
they also view her dismissal as an opportunity to lament the moral
decline of public education _ the same concerns, some of them add,
that have prompted them to support the introduction of publicly
financed vouchers to parochial schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. DeLay is interested for one very simple reason,'' said
Michael Scanlon, an aide to the Republican congressman. ``Our
public school systems are overrun with drugs, crime and guns, and
several undesirable influences. And while these children are
offered condoms and needles, they are denied the opportunity to
reach out to their teachers in times of grief and confusion because
it might strike up a conversation that deals with faith and
morality.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rosario, 43, a member of a Pentecostal church who is
weighing filing a grievance against the board, was quoted by The
Associated Press as telling the news conference: ``I am just a
simple schoolteacher from the South Bronx. I believe this is an
injustice and I hope that with the support gathered here I can get
back and teach my students.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That Ms. Rosario found herself in front of a classroom last fall
says much about the pressures on urban school systems. The school
in which she taught, Intermediate School 74, lies in District 8 in
the Hunts Point section of the South Bronx, an overcrowded district
that is short hundreds of licensed teachers. In September 1997, the
school, among the lowest-performing in the city, was shifted to a
special district, called the Chancellor's District, overseen by
Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rosario, who speaks Spanish and has worked in the system, on
and off, as a substitute since 1993, was hired last fall to teach
bilingual education. There is such a shortage of bilingual teachers
that half of all bilingual teachers citywide do not have state
certification. But because Ms. Rosario had taken courses in
education and Spanish at the College of New Rochelle, from which
she graduated in 1991, she was granted a temporary bilingual
teaching certificate, school officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of the school year, the chancellor's aides said,
Ms. Rosario compiled a checkered record, with three unsatisfactory
evaluations of her teaching from February to April. By May, the
principal of School 74 had already decided that she would not be
invited back next year, said Barbara Byrd-Bennett, the supervising
superintendent of the Chancellor's District.
</P>
<P>
   But parents say that Ms. Rosario was beloved by the children and
that any discussion by school officials about poor teaching is only
being used as justification to support her dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   One parent, Eva Santos, recalled how Ms. Rosario stopped by her
home for an hour, every day for a week, after her son, Juan, 13,
broke his arm. Since his sixth-grade teacher's dismissal, Ms.
Santos said she had found her son holding a newspaper clipping of
his teacher and crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as parents are not upset with what she did,'' Ms. Santos
said. ``Actually, we applaud what she did with the children. We
don't know why the Board of Education took such drastic measures.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least one child, and her guardian, were less
complimentary, particularly when discussing the events of June 8.
</P>
<P>
   On that day, some of her students said in interviews, Ms.
Rosario began talking about God after the principal had called over
the intercom for a moment of silence in memory of Christopher Lee,
a schoolmate who had recently drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Luisa Corporan, 11, said Thursday that she recalled asking her
teacher the first question, ``Where is Christopher Lee?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rosario replied that he was in heaven, Luisa said.
</P>
<P>
   The students then began asking questions, such as ``What is
heaven like?'' or ``What does God look like?''
</P>
<P>
   In a five-page written statement, which she submitted to the
board as part of a disciplinary hearing, Ms. Rosario said she had
then asked how many of the children ``would like to hear about
God?'' Juan, the boy with the broken arm, said his teacher was
emphatic that anyone who did not want to engage in the conversation
could read a book in the back of the classroom, by the computers.
</P>
<P>
   One, or perhaps two boys, left their seats, the children said.
</P>
<P>
   After imploring the children that ``this is something
voluntarily free will,'' Ms. Rosario wrote in her statement, she
then asked ``if anyone would like to accept Jesus as their personal
savior.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They all raised their hands,'' wrote Ms. Rosario, in an
account later confirmed by Juan and Luisa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started praying in Spanish,'' Ms. Rosario wrote, ``then I
went to each one of them. I put my hand in their forehead asking
Jesus to take care of them and their families.''
</P>
<P>
   The children asked their teacher ``if they could pray for
them,'' Luisa said. ``She didn't force nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   But after class, school officials said, one girl called home to
say she had been frightened by what she saw and asked that her
older sister, her guardian, pick her up at school. It was in a
meeting with the school principal, Leroy Johnson, that the girl and
her sister described what had happened. Several other parents also
called, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   At a disciplinary hearing four days later on June 12, school
administrators asked Ms. Rosario if she felt she could refrain from
``preaching'' in class through the end of the school year, Dr.
Byrd-Bennett, the district administrator, said. She recalled that
Ms. Rosario was emphatic that she could give no such assurance, and
was informed that she was being dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   After a lengthy account of her dismissal was headlined on the
June 16 cover of The New York Post, and in shorter articles that
day in The New York Times and The New York Daily News, Ms. Rosario
began receiving an outpouring of support.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, before marching in an evangelical parade, Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani said Ms. Rosario should have received a warning
for her actions, but not a dismissal. Tuesday, several hundred
people, including neighborhood parents and ministers, rallied
alongside her outside the Board of Education headquarters in
downtown Brooklyn, pleading that she get her job back.

SPORTS COLUMN: KNICKS TRADE TAKES THE HEART OUT OF GARDEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saralene Oakley received the disturbing news Thursday afternoon
at Nails, Etc., the beauty salon her sibling helped her get off the
ground in their hometown of Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``They traded my brother?'' Charles Oakley's big sister said.
``What are the Knicks doing? Who do they get? What could they be
thinking after all these years? I'm just in shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe a friend had tickets to one game in two years, and you
remembered Oakley's tenacity. Maybe you were the regular, the guy
who thought it was Take a Knick Home Night as he plunged into your
lap hunting down a loose ball. Perhaps television was your only
link to Oak.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. At some point, all who have had the honor of seeing
him play have expressed a shared community of everymanness. He was
the hod carrier at the construction site, the assembly-line worker
at General Motors. Oakley punched in, punched out, complained under
his breath and poked fun at the blue blazers hurdling each other
for power and position.
</P>
<P>
   Now the familiar face in the lunch room is gone, the 10-year
company man replaced by a younger, cheaper kid two years removed
from college.
</P>
<P>
   It happens every day in America. Yet you never expected the
hardest-working man in basketball to be told he was not useful
enough, that his grit and perseverance were tapped out.
</P>
<P>
   Trading Oakley to the Toronto Raptors on Thursday for Marcus
Camby, a frail 24-year-old, saved the shop-till-they-drop Knicks
slightly more than $2 million, and now they have to consider
whether it was worth it.
</P>
<P>
   If Oakley has a moment, maybe he can provide the answer the way
he did by teasing a Charlotte ball boy after Alonzo Mourning had
been traded to Miami in 1996, leaving the Hornets depleted in the
middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``How y'all going to cook without a stove in the kitchen?'' he
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the obvious questions of who will terrify Chris Webber
into making 2 of 20 shots and how Patrick Ewing will guard anyone
over 250 pounds in the post, is this question: How many times can
Madison Square Garden let go of an aging warrior who elicits such
strong emotions in his teammates and fans?
</P>
<P>
   If Camby falters or the Knicks fall apart, Dave Checketts and
Ernie Grunfeld are going to have to deal with the fact that they
may have taken the passion and desire of a proud veteran for
granted, that Oakley's departure mirrored the erosion of New York's
competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the toughest trade I've ever made,'' said
Checketts, the Garden president.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we all get a little sentimental on the subject of Oakley,
enough to forget that he was outplayed by Antonio Davis two months
ago in Indianapolis. But he, John Starks and Ewing were the Knicks
the last decade, the way Willis Reed, Walt Frazier and Dave
DeBusschere were once the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley was never part of the Starks-Ewing clique. He resented
Starks' poor work ethic at times and wondered why everyone was so
concerned about Ewing wearing an ice pack around his knees when
Oakley was getting stitches in his brow and a cast on his foot.
</P>
<P>
   But do you know who tied Ewing's ties for him when his wrist was
in plaster for five months last season, or who always jumped in
when Starks was in a scrap on the floor? He was ornery and
irritable sometimes. But he was family.
</P>
<P>
   He was stylish without being gaudy _ no other Knick could pull
off wearing a lavender silk suit on game nights. He scowled when he
was playing, but after the buzzer sounded he was just plain Oak.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1997, several of the writers covering the Knicks
half-kidded Oakley about showing them around Cleveland during the
All-Star Game. Oakley nodded and told everyone to be in front of a
hotel at a certain time.
</P>
<P>
   He showed up that Friday night in a wide-brim fedora and a
pin-striped suit, opened the door to a limousine he owned and
ushered everyone in. First stop was Club Togo in Oakley's old
neighborhood, where high school friends told of a young, spry,
Gheri-curled Oak dunking and blowing kisses to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Next stop was his mother Corine's house for a spread of sweet
potato pie, ham hocks and collard greens _ and framed pictures of a
smiling kid who made a mother very proud. Of his beautiful prom
date, he shrugged and said, ``Someone had to take her.''
</P>
<P>
   The visit was not written about and Oakley never once brought it
up as leverage for less-critical stories about him. He simply
wanted to show the people who wrote about him who he was _ the way
he showed Knick fans every night, collecting rebounds, shooting his
medium-range jump shot, beating quicker players down the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave his heart to New York,'' Saralene said. ``This is
almost the end of his career. It's crazy. It's not right. He was
supposed to finish his career there.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no silver lining, no cake or retirement gift. Most
likely, Charles Oakley will finish his career with the worst team
in the Eastern Conference. The Employee of the Decade was just let
go.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks are about business and looking toward the future.
Oakley is about sentiment and living for today. They really don't
deserve him anymore. &QL;

STRAWBERRY LOOKS BACK FONDLY AT THOSE SWAGGERING METS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There was a gray Yankees uniform hanging in Darryl
Strawberry's locker, a blue Yankees cap resting on the floor and
several teammates sprinkled throughout the visiting clubhouse
Thursday, but Strawberry plopped himself inside a baseball time
capsule and went exploring. He journeyed away from the Bronx and
back to Flushing. For 30 glorious and gleeful minutes, it was 1986
again.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from Strawberry's perpetual smile, his continual
giddiness and his sudden expertise as a storyteller, this was a
trip down memory lane that he has wanted to take for a long time.
With Strawberry's return to Shea Stadium to play the Mets at hand
Friday night, the only player this weekend who can wear World
Series Championship rings from both teams oozed with enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   This was fun to hear and fun to watch. For everyone who is tired
of hearing the cliches and tired of hearing how this three-game
series has been too hyped, make friends with one of the eight beat
reporters who covers the Yankees and beg him for a tape of
Strawberry's interview. It was that engaging. Darryl, the current
Yankee and former Met, first sounded like Sybill. But the more he
spoke, the more he sounded like Mr. Met.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're a lot like we were in '86, knowing how to win
and always finding a way to win,'' Strawberry said. ``That's
special. You don't always get to play on teams like that. I've been
able to do it twice. Here I am on my third one. I've been pretty
fortunate to have a career where I came back in New York and was
successful. Those are great stories no matter how you look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry is right. He was in the middle of those arrogant Mets
of 1986 and was in the middle of those lovable Yankees of 1996 and
these respected Yankees of 1998. And he fit snugly every time. He
shared beers with Lenny, Doc and Darling, then switched teams,
changed his life and shares Bible classes with Pettitte, Girardi
and Curtis. But, the mature Strawberry of the Yankees became the
brazen Strawberry of the Mets when he was asked who would win
between the two champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different personality over here,'' Strawberry said.
``Over there, we had a lot of egos and arrogant people that didn't
care. If we had played these guys, we would have probably been
yelling at these guys and calling them wimps. That's just the way
we were.''
</P>
<P>
   Notice that Strawberry used ``we'' to refer to the Mets and
``these guys'' to refer to the Yankees. Informed of this
revelation, he stammered to explain himself before relenting in an
avalanche of laughter. Strawberry, who watched last year's
Mets-Yankees series on television because of knee surgery, did not
even try to be coy when the topic switched to which team he would
align himself with in a grudge match between 1986 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have to play for them because I had that type of
personality back then,'' said Strawberry, using ``them'' to
describe the Mets. ``I would have to be a part of that. I can't
deny something that was there. I was right in the middle with the
rest of them.''
</P>
<P>
   So would the 1986 Darryl call the 1998 Darryl a wimp?
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably so,'' Strawberry said.
</P>
<P>
   And how would the 1998 Darryl react to the insult?
</P>
<P>
   ``He would be like, `Whatever,''' Strawberry said. ``Not much I
can really say about it. I'd rather be this than what I was then.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry said that once, but for most of the 30 minutes, he
did not express that. He was in 1986 and delighted in reminiscing
about how the Mets played hard and partied harder, how Davey
Johnson created an arrogant club by imploring players to walk with
a swagger and be the intimidators, not the intimidated, and how
most fans considered them ``pond scum.'' With each memorable tale,
each smile, the trip got better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was afraid of us,'' Strawberry said.
</P>
<P>
   Would the Yankees be afraid?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' said Strawberry, a startling non-answer since
the Yankees are on pace to win 119 games, 11 more than the 1986
Mets won. ``National League teams were afraid of us. We were a
fighting team. We were a hated team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' fans should not hate Strawberry, the player who has
more homers at Shea Stadium than anyone. They should be thrilled
that a 36-year-old who has endured tax, marriage and
substance-abuse problems is as excited about the three games as
they are. Strawberry will be wearing a Yankee uniform Friday, but
Thursday he leaped in a time capsule and was a Met again. It was a
pleasant ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being successful in New York is like being on top of the
world,'' Strawberry said. ``I don't think a lot of people
understand that. I do. I've been there and I understand.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wall Street's competitive culture has always been populated by
more than a few sports fans. But now the institutions themselves _
banks, brokerage firms, money managers and mutual fund companies _
are developing a love of the game. Or, more exactly, a love of the
players and their substantial paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   In a period when skyrocketing salaries and signing bonuses,
multiyear contracts and lucrative endorsements can push annual
incomes well into the millions, professional athletes as a group
have become highly desirable and actively courted clients.
</P>
<P>
   A few institutions have gone as far as setting up separate
departments just to serve athletes. For example, Star Banc Corp. in
Cincinnati opened such a division three years ago and put two
former college football players and current vice presidents,
Jonathan Hayes and Earl Layne, in charge of managing money for some
80 professional athletes.
</P>
<P>
   State Street Research and Management, the United States'
second-oldest mutual fund manager, which has guarded the fortunes
of generations of patrician Bostonians, inaugurated its Athletes
fund last autumn and hired a retired Bruins hockey star, Derek
Sanderson, as resident rainmaker. Others, like Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.,
have tried to make their sales forces more athlete-savvy.
</P>
<P>
   These companies are charging onto a field once used only by a
handful of boutique money managers, like CSI Management in San
Francisco or Investment Advisors International in Cleveland. (IAI
is a division of the International Management Group, which got its
start representing golfers and tennis players in the 1960s.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing a lot more competition, especially from
traditional Wall Street houses and even Big Six accounting firms,''
said Leland H. Faust, president of CSI.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, most professional athletes were considered
anything but the carriage trade. Just ask John Havlicek, the
legendary Boston Celtic and 13-time National Basketball Association
all-star. Havlicek earned only $15,000 as a rookie in 1962,
equivalent to about $80,500 today, and even worked in the
off-season as a representative for a hardware and home-appliance
company.
</P>
<P>
   He and a couple of other Celtics tried to pool their money and
buy a few hundred dollars' worth of stock, but had trouble finding
a broker who would take them on as clients, Havlicek recalled.
</P>
<P>
   According to Faust, ``When the top salary in major league
baseball was $700,000, it wasn't chump change, but there were still
a lot of higher-paid people around.'' Now, when the median salary
in major-league baseball is $1.3 million, he said, ``you have a
bigger market.''
</P>
<P>
   Athletes now ``qualify as bona fide clients,'' Faust added.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, however, athletes are very different from other
clients in their income bracket, like corporate executives, doctors
or lawyers. They are typically much younger and suddenly wealthy _
often signing fat bonus contracts in their teens _ and have spent
their lives learning to excel in their sport, not in finance.
</P>
<P>
   Many are from small-town or working-class backgrounds, and few
have had much exposure to money management. They have too often
been prey to dubious advice from flamboyant agents or hangers-on.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, institutional money management for professional
athletes has become a specialty that combines private banking and
trust-department functions with the roles of coach, psychologist
and even guardian.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers find themselves steering clients clear of risky
ventures like nightclubs and restaurants, car-wash franchises and
oil-and-gas partnerships that are often pitched to athletes and
other celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I see guys lose money on bad investments,'' said
Victor Green, a defensive back for the New York Jets who recently
signed a three-year contract for a total of $3 million and keeps
his money with Star Bank, a unit of Star Banc.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes and their advisers also face the challenge of planning
for a lifetime around a peak earnings period that can be
agonizingly brief.
</P>
<P>
   John L. Macklin, president of IAI, which has $1 billion in
assets under management and counts Havlicek and the retired tennis
champion Martina Navratilova among the firm's clients, says he
invests an athlete's money as if it were the portfolio of a
58-year-old executive just a few years shy of retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Such an outlook calls for a fairly conservative strategy. Star
Bank's portfolio managers typically suggest a mixture of about 60
percent large-cap equities, 30 percent bonds and the remainder in
money market funds. Specific stocks that Star Bank recommends to
athletes include Walt Disney; Sofamor Danek, a medical-supply
company, and Clear Channel Communications, which operates a large
chain of radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   At State Street Research, Gardner Jackson Jr., a portfolio
manager, says the firm's new Athletes fund, which requires a
minimum initial investment of $500,000, is mainly invested in
large-cap growth stocks, and performs like a State Street
institutional mutual fund that had a 47.4 percent total return for
the 12 months ended April 30, a bit better than the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index during the period.
</P>
<P>
   The fund holds stakes in 55 companies including General
Electric, DuPont and two hot drug companies, Warner Lambert and
Pfizer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Advisers often find themselves helping their athlete clients
with day-to-day money matters. Surrounded by temptations to spend
heavily on luxury clothes and cars, multiple homes and late nights
on the town, professional athletes sometimes need reminding that
succumbing would mean robbing their own future, the advisers say.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Ready of the Denver office of Prudential Securities, who
has about 50 football players as clients, said one player called
him from Las Vegas to ask for more money after he had lost $4,000
gambling. ``I told him no and he got mad, but when he got back to
Denver he gave me a big hug,'' Ready said.
</P>
<P>
   At Star Bank, Layne, who played football at Liberty University
while earning a degree in finance, has attracted many players as
clients with similarly personalized service. He and Hayes, who
founded the bank's pro sports division, routinely take care of
extracurricular tasks like seeing that clients' bills are paid and
that their insurance policies are renewed on time.
</P>
<P>
   Not all clients, of course, need or want such help. And advisers
say it is often hard to persuade naturally aggressive athletes to
play it safe with their money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell the guys that they are already on third base and don't
need to hit a home run,'' Layne said. ``All they need to do is hit
singles and doubles, and that will get them home.''

<P>
   NANTES, France _ Say goodbye to the 1998 American World Cup
team. It was to soccer what American cheese is to food _ bland,
formless and ultimately harmless.
</P>
<P>
   They disappeared into history Thursday night with a 1-0 loss to
Yugoslavia, which is no shame, considering that Yugoslavia has the
firepower of a semifinalist team. However, the Americans had
already identified themselves as mushy in previous losses to
Germany and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The team will always be remembered as having very little in
common with the American team that qualified from a grueling
two-year tournament in the Americas. That team was dismantled by
the coach, Steve Sampson, in recent weeks, starting with the
still-unexplained sacking of John Harkes, the doughty captain.
</P>
<P>
   Sampson's reward for such last-minute tinkering will surely be
his freedom to seek new challenges in the wonderful world of work.
The officials of the United States Soccer Federation called a press
conference in the wee small hours of Thursday morning to insist
that Sampson has indeed not been dismissed, but that a decision
will be made within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Sampson's departure will come too late for the cadre of veterans
who held the team together for much of this decade, but were
discarded in recent months. As the team went to a rural retreat in
Beaujolais country, the players began whining about being isolated,
far from the bright lights of downtown Lyon.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Alexi Lalas made several grumpy remarks about
the demise of the team. To combat the mutterings, Alan Rothenberg,
the president of the federation, addressed the players Wednesday.
He said there was no threat involved: ``I just told them to think
about what you say. Don't say anything you might regret.''
</P>
<P>
   Since this tournament is being held in the land of liberte,
fraternite, egalite, a few of the lads felt they had the freedom to
say a few words after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll all get older, and we'll all have scrapbooks,'' said
Lalas, normally flippant but apparently furious. ``I'm satisfied
with myself, even though I didn't play a minute here. I'll be
satisfied with my scrapbook. Steve has to be satisfied with his
scrapbook.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampson may not want to put into his scrapbook the epitaph from
Tab Ramos, the crabby little midfielder who was a star in the 1990
and 1994 World Cups but only a bit player here.
</P>
<P>
   ``For one reason or another, this whole thing was a shambles,''
said Ramos, who noted that 17 different players saw action in the
first two games, and ``everybody felt he should play.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those was Eric Wynalda, the all-time leading scorer, who
was brought in late Thursday night, and was not a factor.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is hard for strikers to function in Sampson's
3-6-1- formation, which leaves one lonely forward as isolated as
the frontier scout played by Kevin Costner in the movie ``Dances
With Wolves.''
</P>
<P>
   Wynalda said he thought Sampson's decisions were ``personal,''
not necessarily connected to soccer, but he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Once the players had trudged off into history, Rothenberg and
his associates talked up the future of U.S. soccer. Sunil Gulati,
the vice president of the federation, who deals with the players,
noted that the United States used to have a pool of 20 players but
now has 100 good players available, and that war horses like
Marcelo Balboa, Lalas and Ramos might never come along again
because competition would limit players to shorter terms.
Rothenberg noted that the United States had achieved a second-round
loss to Brazil in 1994, and he insisted this year's three-and-out
performance was in some ways an improvement. He must have been
watching Nigeria or Mexico. The U.S. team basically could not pass
or shoot. To their credit, however, the lads did qualify for
France, which allowed hundreds of Americans to wander around this
lovely Loire Estuary town, happily eating crustaceans and wearing
their Sam's Army T-shirts, soon to be collectors' items.
</P>
<P>
   But Americans are notorious front-runners, as proven by the
American federation's return of 1,000 tickets that were unsold once
the United States was skunked by Iran, 2-1, last Sunday in Lyon.
</P>
<P>
   Now some of the lads take a brief vacation before their European
clubs start again, while others will be playing for their Major
League Soccer teams as soon as Saturday night. The federation goes
looking for a coach. Carlos Queiroz, the experienced Portuguese
coach, has committed to coach the United Arab Emirates. Carlos
Alberto Parreira, who won the 1994 World Cup with Brazil, has just
been dismissed by Saudi Arabia. Rothenberg leaves office on Aug.
23, but promises a coaching decision by then.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, there are more crustaceans in Nantes, and 16
good soccer teams starting Saturday. Oddly enough, without the
Yanks, the world keeps spinning.

PROTESTERS ASK PERU'S LEADER TO FREE A NEW YORK WOMAN
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The worlds of Mark and Rhoda Berenson, the parents of
a New York woman who has been imprisoned in Peru, and President
Alberto Fujimori, the Peruvian leader who has rejected calls for
her release, intersected Thursday night at the Hilton hotel in
midtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the hotel, the Berensons and about 30 others
demonstrated for two hours, demanding the release of Lori Helene
Berenson, a 28-year-old former Manhattan resident who is serving a
life sentence in a Peruvian prison after being convicted on
terrorism charges. Inside, Fujimori attended a conference on
financial services for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   But the two sides never met; security guards made sure of that.
They had plenty to say about one another in stoking a case that has
cast a spotlight on the activities of Americans living abroad and
on the methods of the Peruvian courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're a coward,'' Berenson shouted, speaking as much to the
Peruvian cameras as he was to the local media. ``Give Lori what she
deserves. I'm getting impatient.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori, meanwhile, spoke about Ms. Berenson at a brief press
conference, branding her a terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must be just. We must make justice,'' he said in halting
English. ``Peru has the right as the United States to have a
peaceful country. You don't have want to have more World Trade
Center problems,'' he said, referring to the 1993 bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Berenson's plight returned to the headlines this week after
Javier Valle Riestra, Peru's new prime minister, said she should be
freed or given a new trial. Fujimori rejected that suggestion.
Valle Riestra then offered his resignation, but Fujimori would not
accept it.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Berenson has been held in a prison high in the Andes since
her conviction in January 1996 by a tribunal that did not permit
her lawyers to question the evidence or to cross-examine witnesses.
She was accused of assisting the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary
Movement, a Marxist guerrilla group, in a plan to take the Peruvian
congress hostage.
</P>
<P>
   This last weekend, Ms. Berenson's father and uncle visited her
in prison. She was frail, they said, with her eyesight failing, her
voice hoarse and her complexion purple from the cold temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   The Berensons found out only Wednesday night that Fujimori was
scheduled to be in New York this week. They hastily made
arrangements to get as close as possible to the man who controls
their daughter's fate. They distributed placards and chanted
slogans. They played, over and over, a folk song called ``A Voice
in the Distance'' that had been written for their daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Not everything went as planned. Shortly after the demonstration
began at 5 p.m. on the southeast corner of the Avenue of the
Americas and West 54th Street, several police officers ordered the
protesters to first move to the northwest corner, then to the
northeast one.
</P>
<P>
   And the protesters could not gain access to the air-conditioned
and carpeted confines of Fujimori's press conference at the
Microcredit Summit Meeting of Councils.
</P>
<P>
   That did not prevent Mrs. Berenson from thinking about
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went into the hotel earlier just to see where the meeting
was,'' Mrs. Berenson said. ``I said, `Gee, what happens if I see
him?' I would say, as a mother, parent to parent, `Why are you
doing this? Please have some humanity.'''

 &HT;    Braves just not 'sharp' Klesko says
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- This is not October. The interleague schedule is for
freaks. Half the starting infield is out. Explain it away however
you want, then explain this:
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have lost five times in seven games, and what
happened to them Wednesday night usually happens out behind the
barn.
</P>
<P>
   Spotting Atlanta an early two-run lead, the Yankees pounded five
Braves pitchers for 13 hits and won a walkover 10-6, taking their
second of three games from the Braves this week. Atlanta made three
errors that led to four unearned runs, and Yankees starter David
Cone (10-2) held the Braves to two earned runs and five hits
through seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Millwood (9-4) never got out of the fourth, yielding five
runs and losing his second consecutive game for the first time
since his first two major-league starts last July. Javy Lopez's
17th homer, a three-run job off Mike Stanton in the eighth, spruced
up the score, but it came after half of the 48,980 assembled had
departed Turner Field. They saw the nastiest home performance of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of our tops, that's for sure,'' said Ryan Klesko,
an emergency fill-in at first base after Andres Galarraga was
scratched with a stiff back. ``Just one of those things where we
weren't very sharp for the game. Errors put us under. What cost us
the game was defense today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves led 2-0 after two innings, after which the Yankees
worked Millwood over. Paul O'Neill homered in the third and New
York sent eight men to the plate in the four-run fourth. After a
9-2 start this year, Millwood in his last two starts has thrown a
combined 4 2/3 innings, giving up 14 hits and 12 runs while his ERA
has soared to 4.78.
</P>
<P>
   ``Around the fourth, he started throwing the ball around the
middle of the plate instead of using the corners,'' said Lopez.
``That's when the other team gets the advantage. Then he started
walking a few people. ``Also,'' added Lopez, whose throwing error
hurt in the decisive fourth, ``we didn't play defense at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's bullpen gave up another five runs (just two earned)
and the Braves were simply not built for an American League
three-hour slamfest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were ahead in the ballgame,'' said manager Bobby Cox. ``We
have to pitch a little better.''
</P>
<P>
   With shortstop Walt Weiss at his son Brody's bedside, with
Galarraga questionable tonight with a back so sore he was barely
able to dress, the prognosis for tonight's fourth game with the
Yankees is hardly bright.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything bad is happening right now,'' said Galarraga, who
missed his first start as a Brave. ``We know we can get better.
We're kind of struggling, myself too.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa breaks record
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa broke the major league record for home runs in a
month Thursday night, hitting his 19th of June in the seventh
inning of the Chicago Cubs' game against the Detroit Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, who has 32 homers overall, broke the mark set by Detroit's
Rudy York in August 1937.

 &HT;    Reno may order limited probe of King assassination evidence
 &HT;    By Arthur Brice
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Attorney General Janet Reno is expected to announce
today that she has approved a new investigation into the
30-year-old assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   According to news reports Thursday, Justice Department officials
told some members of Congress that Reno will authorize a limited
inquiry rather than the full-scale probe that the King family has
requested.
</P>
<P>
   Reno also is likely to reject the King family's request that she
empanel a national truth and reconciliation commission that would
have the authority to grant immunity in return for testimony, The
Associated Press said, citing unnamed Justice Department officials.
</P>
<P>
   The King family had not heard anything from the Justice
Department as of late Thursday. Coretta Scott King, the slain civil
rights leader's widow, said she would not comment until she
receives official notification.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials said Reno had not reached a
decision yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is definite,'' said spokeswoman Lauren Varien.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. King and three of her children met with Reno in April and
with President Clinton last week. They cited new evidence in their
request for a probe.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings tried last year to obtain a new trial for James Earl
Ray, who pleaded guilty in 1969 to the April 4, 1968, murder but
recanted within days. Ray died in April at age 70.
</P>
<P>
   Former FBI agent Donald Wilson came forth in March with two
pieces of paper he said he found in Ray's abandoned car 30 years
ago in Atlanta. Both papers contain the name Raul.
</P>
<P>
   Ray maintained he was set up by a shadowy smuggler he knew only
as Raul.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said Thursday he has not been contacted by anyone from
the Justice Department but is concerned about turning the evidence
over to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bureau called it a fake without having seen it,'' Wilson
said. ``My concern is what would become of it. Would it be received
and preserved with the best of intentions?''

 By STEPHEN LABATON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Thursday broadly affirmed the
rights of clients to take to their graves their consultations with
lawyers. The ruling was a legal setback for the Whitewater
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, who was seeking the notes of
the lawyer who had represented Vincent Foster, the deputy White
House counsel who committed suicide nearly five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the 6-3 decision was an important victory for a prominent
array of lawyer organizations and groups representing the
terminally ill and psychiatrists. They had argued that any erosion
of the lawyer-client privilege would have a devastating impact on
the relationship between lawyers and their clients, leaving hollow
a well-grounded doctrine of confidentiality that is the cornerstone
of modern law practice because it provides the fundamental
incentive for clients to be speak candidly with their lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The justices ruled that three pages of notes taken by Foster's
lawyer, James Hamilton, at a meeting of the two did not lose its
protection under the lawyer-client privilege when Foster died nine
days later.
</P>
<P>
   In issuing a subpoena for the notes, Starr had maintained that
Foster's death extinguished the privilege. He had claimed that the
lawyer's notes were central to the inquiry into the circumstances
of Foster's death and the dismissal of the staff of the White House
travel office in 1993, an event which, by all accounts, had
contributed to Foster's deepening depression.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton had argued that the notes of his consultation with
Foster were protected, even posthumously, by the privilege.
Thursday the high court, reversing a federal appeals court
decision, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been generally, if not universally, accepted, for well
over a century, that the attorney-client privilege survives the
death of the client in a case such as this,'' Chief Justice William
Rehnquist wrote for the court. ``While the arguments against the
survival of the privilege are by no means frivolous, they are based
in large part on speculation _ thoughtful speculation, but
speculation nonetheless _ as to whether posthumous termination of
the privilege would diminish a client's willingness to confide in
an attorney.''
</P>
<P>
   The justices rejected Starr's claim that any effect on the
client-lawyer relationship would be minimal. Starr had argued that
when clients seek advice from lawyers, they do not give much
thought to what happens after they die.
</P>
<P>
   But the court said many clients have an abiding interest in
posthumously preserving their reputations and protecting their
survivors from the intrusions of investigators.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Knowing that communications will remain confidential even
after death encourages the client to communicate fully and frankly
with counsel,'' the court said. ``While the fear of disclosure, and
the consequent withholding of information from counsel, may be
reduced if disclosure is limited to posthumous disclosure in a
criminal context, it seems unreasonable to assume that it vanishes
altogether. Clients may be concerned about reputation, civil
liability, or possible harm to friends or family. Posthumous
disclosure of such communications may be as feared as disclosure
during the client's lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the justices speculated, it was ``quite plausible that
Foster, perhaps already contemplating suicide, may not have sought
legal advice from Hamilton if he had not been assured the
conversation was privileged.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr, who has repeatedly criticized the administration for
invoking a variety of privileges to limit testimony in his inquiry,
on Thursday issued a brief statement that expressed disappointment
in the outcome of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue has obviously proved to be of considerable
difficulty, as the divided opinions of the Supreme Court and the
Court of Appeals reveal,'' he said. ``In all events, we continue to
pursue our investigation as thoroughly and expeditiously as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to know what impact the decision in the case
will have on the long-running inquiry by Starr because it will
probably never be known whether Hamilton's notes contained anything
useful to investigators. While Foster was a close confidant of
President Clinton and a former law partner of Hillary Rodham
Clinton, Starr has won other legal fights over privilege issues
only to obtain relatively unimportant evidence.
</P>
<P>
   But as a matter of law, the ruling Thursday was a decisive
defeat for Starr, who had asked the court to put the case on a fast
track.
</P>
<P>
   Even the court's three dissenters _ Justices Sandra Day
O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas _ refused to go as far
as Starr had sought in his argument that in criminal cases, the
privilege dies with the client.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the dissenting justices proposed that there be a new and
narrow exception to the privilege after death allowing for a lawyer
to turn over material to criminal investigators only in exceptional
circumstances and when the information is not generally available
elsewhere. They cited the compelling example of when a client,
before dying, confesses to a crime for which another person is
being tried.
</P>
<P>
   In a footnote, the majority dismissed the dissent's concerns
about such cases, saying that issue was not squarely before the
court in the case decided Thursday, Swidler &AMP; Berlin vs. United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The court refused to extend the main exception to the
lawyer-client privilege after the death of a client _ in disputes
between heirs. In those cases, most state courts have found that
the disclosure of confidences is permissible because it furthers
the client's intent in disposing of an estate.
</P>
<P>
   But the court declined to adopt the argument by Starr that that
exception to the privilege should be expanded to include criminal
inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason to suppose as a general matter that grand
jury testimony about confidential communications furthers the
client's intent,'' the court said.
</P>
<P>
   The case began in 1995, when a federal grand jury, at the
request of Starr, issued a subpoena to Hamilton for the notes. A
district court judge, after privately examining the notes,
concluded that they were protected by the lawyer-client privilege.
Last year a divided three-judge panel of the District of Columbia
U.S. Court of Appeals reversed, finding that the need of the
investigators for the notes outweighed the policy reasons behind
confidentiality.

BEARD-BAN DISPUTE TURNS INTO CONSTITUTIONAL DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ The seemingly simple and harmless matter of
growing a beard may be neither, judging by the constitutional
arguments Thursday before a federal appeals court panel. At issue
is whether Newark can dismiss two police officers who wear beards
because of their Sunni Muslim beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   The two officers, Faruq Abdul-Aziz, who has been on the force
for nine years, and Shakoor Mustafa, who has been an officer for 12
years, face dismissal under a 1971 department regulation that
requires officers to be clean-shaven unless medical reasons prevent
them from complying.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. District Court judge last year blocked the dismissal of
the officers, maintaining that their right to religious expression
outweighed the department's authority to enforce a management
directive that city officials said was intended to promote
discipline and order.
</P>
<P>
   It is a case that has yoked together uncommon allies and
seemingly incompatible ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for both sides in the case said there was little settled
law on the intersection of beards, religious observances and
management prerogatives, and court rulings in recent years have
gone both ways. In fact, the entire issue of how and which
religious practices are protected has been in question since last
June, when the U.S. Supreme Court re-established itself, not
Congress, as the arbiter of such questions.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, lawyers in the case predicted that regardless
of the decision by the three-judge panel in Newark, the case was
likely to end up before the United States' highest court.
</P>
<P>
   As the arguments unfolded in the old federal courthouse, the
case presented a host of incongruities. For one, it involves two
black police officers who are asserting their individuality in a
predominantly black city with a black political leadership while
being defended by the predominantly white leadership of the
Fraternal Order of Police, the officers' union.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, their case is supported by an uncommon alliance of
the American Civil Liberties Union; the Anti-Defamation League, a
Jewish organization; and the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a
public-interest law firm that argues for wider expression of
religious, and generally Christian, traditions.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's arguments, the city of Newark defended a rule that
was originally intended to prevent the wearing of long hair and
beards as emblems of protest in the 1960s and '70s. The department
does not enforce the rule, which permits mustaches, for about two
dozen officers who have presented doctors' letters saying that the
men have a skin condition that prevents them from shaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am amazed that the city of Newark with its large minority
population is fighting to do this,'' said Jack McEntee, president
of the Fraternal Order of Police. ``If this was happening in a
small, mostly white town anywhere, you would have busloads of
people here to protest.''
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Saunders, who represented the city, said Thursday that
the regulation prohibiting beards was essential to the ``esprit de
corps'' of the police department and to maintaining a professional
atmosphere. To allow the department's Muslims to wear beards, he
said, would create ``a superior religious right'' that no other
religious group had.
</P>
<P>
   In a spirited exchange with the lawyers, the three judges _
Samuel Alito Jr., Morton Greenber and Theodore Mckee _ asked
whether the department was stifling ``a legitimate uniqueness''
that the Constitution sought to protect and whether the department
was asserting that there would be order from uniform grooming when
this result was not supported by any studies.
</P>
<P>
   The judges also questioned whether the city was trying to
enforce a uniformity that was impossible and even unwise in a
multicultural society.
</P>
<P>
   There was even a joke from Mckee, who is black and has a beard.
``So you say that we should, and pardon the pun, accept as gospel
the police director's view that beards are unprofessional,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The judges said they would consider the case and rule later.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Cannan, the lawyer for the two men, quoted passages from
the Koran and statements from the men's imam, or spiritual leader,
supporting the religious significance of beards and their
obligation to wear beards.
</P>
<P>
   Cannan contended that their beards were protected by the
Constitution not only as a sincere religious expression, but also
as an expression of free speech. He said that Newark was required
to show ``a compelling interest'' to justify its grooming
regulations.

MILLIONAIRE INDICTED IN CONNING ARIZONA AGENCY INTO PAYING FOR
SURGERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM HERMANN AND SUSIE   
 Steckner  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Phoenix-area millionaire Michael Phillips recently got
an operation. Trouble is, authorities say, he claimed to be
destitute and conned the state into helping pay for his surgery.
</P>
<P>
   And he's far from alone, say officials of the Arizona Health
Care Cost Containment System.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word on the street was, and may still be, that anyone can
get AHCCCS,'' said Sharon Miller, who oversees the agency's member
fraud unit.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, who was indicted Thursday, might be only one of
hundreds of clients who've conned the state's medical insurance
program for the poor out of hundreds of thousands of dollars in
just the past year.
</P>
<P>
   From 10 to 15 percent of people receiving public assistance get
their benefits fraudulently, national estimates say. For the $1.8
billion AHCCCS program, that could translate into about $250
million.
</P>
<P>
   Injured last year when a car hit his bicycle, Phillips racked up
$37,000 in medical bills. The state paid out just $3,533; the
remainder was covered by the driver's insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   AHCCCS verified one claim made by Phillips, but the others went
unchecked.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that particular case, I think they took the person's word
for it,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, 50, was arrested Thursday at his Scottsdale home. He
has been indicted on one count each of fraud schemes and theft.
</P>
<P>
   According to investigators, Phillips has an investment portfolio
valued at more than $850,000 and more than $1 million in real
estate and vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   At a court hearing Thursday, Phillips appeared wearing plastic
thongs, a pair of rumpled shorts and a T-shirt. He said he is a
licensed residential real estate broker who has lived in Scottsdale
for 25 years and the area for about 40.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by Judge Michael Simonson if he needed a court-appointed
attorney, Phillips said, ``I don't know. I am suffering from a head
injury.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge told Phillips to try to hire an attorney on his own
and set his bail for $160,000.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference earlier in the day called by Maricopa
County Attorney Rick Romley and AHCCCS, state officials said they
have increased efforts to detect fraud.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the agency only investigated doctors and other
providers, but it began looking into member fraud in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, the agency has completed more than 500
investigations and found fraud in 30 percent of them.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said the agency routinely investigates applicants'
claims, checking out Social Security and motor vehicle records,
welfare rolls and employment history.
</P>
<P>
   In July, she said, the agency will add investigators to conduct
more in-depth checks before a person is approved.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the agency will have several weeks to check out
an applicant. Because Phillips was hospitalized already, AHCCCS had
just 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips was injured June 6, 1997, and admitted to St. Joseph's
Hospital and Medical Center. Four days later, he met with an AHCCCS
eligibility worker.
</P>
<P>
   He claimed to be indigent and said he had been living out of his
Volkswagen van. He also said he had to borrow money from his mother
to return to Phoenix from Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said the agency verified the claim about borrowing money.
She said the agency ``had no way of knowing'' about his
out-of-state assets and would have had difficulty tracking the
local property he owns because of his common name.
</P>
<P>
   If officials had checked further, they would have found
Phillips' riches:
</P>
<P>
   The $850,000 investment portfolios with firms in Beverly Hills
and Scottsdale; five homes in the Phoenix area with values ranging
from about $40,000 to $83,000; two parcels of land valued at
$30,000; and three vehicles registered in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   But Phillips was deemed indigent and enrolled in the AHCCCS
program for six months. The agency finally learned about the
alleged fraud last July the way they discover most abuse: through
an anonymous tip.
</P>
<P>
   AHCCCS has had its share of problems in recent years and is the
focus of a federal inquiry into allegations of fraud, abuse and
mismanagement. The three-year investigation stems from charges by
ex-employees that the agency left dead recipients on the rolls,
disabled critical computer checks and retaliated against employees
who spoke out.
</P>
<P>
   AHCCCS officials also had been accused of attempting to obstruct
the federal investigation. But in May, the U.S. Attorney's Office
concluded that such claims were false.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a 1996 report by the federal Health Care Financing
Administration took AHCCCS to task for not being tougher on fraud
and not working more closely with the state Attorney General's
Office to prosecute cheaters. &QL;

CLINTON TALKS TO CHINESE VILLAGERS WHO VOTED IN LOCAL ELECTIONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Friday is cq in lede; also notice dateline change from

<TEXT>
<P>
   XIA HE, China _ Hoping to put an early positive spin on his
controversial China journey, President Clinton traveled Friday to a
well-scrubbed village where the locals said rudimentary elections
had made a difference in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton talked for about an hour with a handful of villagers
seated under a shady tree, then addressed more townsfolk in the
courtyard of a primary school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to show early on that the president's talk about
progress in China was not a pipedream,'' said an administration
source involved in laying out Clinton's nine-day state visit. The
journey is the president's first trip to the world's most populous
nation and most important remaining authoritarian regime.
</P>
<P>
   Planners selected the village not only because it is just off
the road to one of China's biggest tourist attractions, the buried
army of Qin dynasty terra-cotta warriors, but also because it has
held elections under a 10-year-old draft law, which is the first
test of democracy in the nation's many millennia.
</P>
<P>
   Huang Xiang Li, a 31-year-old villager, said local elections in
1995 had resulted in some changes in government, including the
defeat of ``some old people,'' whom a U.S. source said were
apparently long-serving Communist Party hacks.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear if they had been replaced by other members of
the only political party allowed in China, or local people not
affiliated with the Communists.
</P>
<P>
   Villages are the basic governmental unit in China's countryside,
where 70 percent of the 1.2 billion population lives, and the only
level where direct elections are allowed. No plans have been
announced for taking the electoral experiment to a higher level of
government, and a Western scholar said, ``to connect the dots to
higher levels ... is problematic.''
</P>
<P>
   Huang, a mother of two who works in the thriving tourist
industry, expressed satisfaction with the elections, as did Wang
Xiang, who is now 21 and had just become eligible to vote in the
elections three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have changed for the better,'' Wang said Thursday, as
final preparations for Clinton's visit proceeded. She cited
improvements in overall living standards and in the quality of the
local schools.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin O'Brien, a visiting professor at the University of
California at Berkeley who has studied China's embryonic elections,
said the process was a one-on-one affair _ a comment that Wang
backed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted for people whom I really trusted,'' she said, ``some
old, some new.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said Clinton's visit could provide ``a really big
boost'' for the election process, which the national government has
said will be made permanent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The motive (for Clinton's visit) may be propaganda and public
relations, but the effect could be real,'' O'Brien said in a
telephone interview from California. He added, however, the
elections should not be viewed as fully democratic, given the
prohibition on organized opposition to the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese are very committed to making it a success _ as
they understand it,'' O'Brien said. If a non-Communist is elected,
he said, the party would quickly attempt to recruit the winner, who
is ``obviously an up and coming young elite.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said a principal effect of the elections has been that
they ``allow the most unpopular (Communist) cadres to be kept from
running villages.''
</P>
<P>
   A Clinton administration official said that White House
personnel scouted several villages and eliminated some because
their elections had seemed less than genuine.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the village votes have been observed by teams from the
Atlanta-based center sponsored by former President Carter, and
their reports have been generally supportive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the lack of a democratic tradition and limited
education, villagers were quite capable of making intelligent
choices,'' Tan Qingshan, a political scientist at Cleveland State
University and a Carter Center observer, wrote in an article for
the English-language China Daily.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made a point of stopping in Xia He before going on to
view the pottery warriors, the tourist highlight of his first full
day in China.
</P>
<P>
   The president flies to Beijing on Friday night to be formally
welcomed Saturday morning at a ceremony in Tiananmen Square, where
Chinese army troops killed hundreds of protesters in putting down a
1989 pro-democracy movement.
</P>
<P>
   Xia He is an old farming village whose fortunes took a dramatic
upturn when the 2,000-year-old terra-cotta army was discovered
nearby in 1974. The village makes enough money off a
government-owned souvenir factory that all the 374 residents have
cable television.
</P>
<P>
   Wang has watched enough international news to know that Clinton
defeated incumbent President Bush in 1992 because the U.S. economy
was in a slump, ``but now the economy has gotten better.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang said locals were also familiar with Clinton's ``troubles''
back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we know,'' she said smiling, but refused to be drawn into
specifics. ``That's the American people's affair.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite some modern technology, old-fashioned touches abound in
Xia He, including big haystacks in front of most houses that
provide fuel for cooking. A peasant towing a hand-pulled cart
scattered visitors on the narrow main street the day before
Clinton's visit.
</P>
<P>
   The village is a neat collection of red-brick houses, many in
the traditional style with walled courtyards and some with a second
story, suggesting a touch of relative affluence. Many renovations
were in evidence, in addition to the recent sprucing up for
Clinton's visit.
</P>
<P>
   It was also clear that White House advance staff had thoroughly
prepared the way for the Clintons: a baby just learning to walk
clutched its mother's hand while teething on a color picture of
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In the schoolyard, colorful banners _ from a decorating company
in Xi'an _ fluttered with welcoming messages for the U.S. party,
including: ``Although far away, if you have close friends, you are
like neighbors.''

CATHOLICS TO SIGN DECLARATION ON SALVATION WITH LUTHERANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs for clarifications, additional material throughout. No

 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a decision intended to resolve an issue that split the
Western Christian world nearly 500 years ago, the Vatican said
Thursday that it would sign a declaration with most of the world's
Lutherans affirming that Roman Catholics and Lutherans share a
basic understanding of how human beings receive God's forgiveness
and salvation.
</P>
<P>
   The document, approved last week by the Lutheran World
Federation, declares that Catholics and Lutherans have found an
essential common ground on the issue of ``justification,'' the
action by which a human being is made worthy of salvation.
</P>
<P>
   The Reformation leader Martin Luther held that justification
comes solely through faith in God, while the Catholic church taught
that a person's good works play a role.
</P>
<P>
   Now, through the declaration, Catholics and Lutherans agree that
divine forgiveness and salvation come only through God's grace and
that good works flow from that.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus, while acknowledging that serious differences
remain between the two churches on the issue, represents a new
appreciation for basic elements in each other's teachings along
with recognition of beliefs they share. The declaration is a result
of years of biblical scholarship, inter-church dialogue and a
renunciation of age-old stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   Catholics and Lutherans also remain divided by major issues of
faith, such as the infallibility of the pope and the ordination of
women.
</P>
<P>
   Although the debate on justification might seem rarefied to
people outside these churches, it has historically been heated and
regarded by Lutherans and other Protestants as crucial to their
religious identity.
</P>
<P>
   Although Catholics and Lutherans have been increasingly working
together in this country and in Germany in recent years, the legacy
of the Reformation has kept tensions alive between the two groups
in some other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   In accepting the document, called ``The Joint Declaration on the
Doctrine of Justification,'' Catholics and Lutherans agreed that
the condemnations they hurled at each other in the 16th century, as
Europe slid into a devastating period of religious warfare, no
longer apply.
</P>
<P>
   Announcing the Vatican position in Rome, Cardinal Edward
Cassidy, president of the Pontifical Council for Promoting
Christian Unity, said, ``I wish to stress that the consensus
reached on the doctrine of justification, despite its limitations,
virtually resolves a long disputed question at the close of the
20th century, on the eve of the new millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   But both Cassidy and the Vatican, in its statement, said that
areas of considerable disagreement required further discussion. The
cardinal also said the declaration ``has limits,'' in that it does
not address major differences between Catholics and Lutherans on
such issues as authority in the church.
</P>
<P>
   But the cardinal said a signing would take place in the fall,
with ``a celebration of the consensus.''
</P>
<P>
   The declaration is a carefully nuanced document based on 30
years of discussions between Catholic and Lutheran theologians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Together we confess,'' the declaration states, ``by grace
alone,'' human beings are ``accepted by God and receive the Holy
Spirit,'' which renews their hearts and calls them to good works.
It goes on to acknowledge specific differences in Catholic and
Lutheran understandings of certain aspects of the issue, including
a disagreement on whether a person remains a sinner after receiving
forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration's acceptance by both the Vatican and the
Lutheran federation represents a triumph for supporters of the
ecumenical movement, which has urged closer cooperation among
churches.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It comes at a time of growing awareness among Christians in the
United States and Europe of a need to pull together in the face of
challenges posed by the growth of faiths like Islam and Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
   Ten months ago the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the
nation's largest Lutheran denomination, entered into an agreement
of ``full communion'' with three smaller Protestant denominations,
allowing for, among other things, exchange of clergy members. The
Rev. Daniel Martensen, ecumenical officer for the Evangelical
Lutherans, said the move represented ``a change of mood'' among
churches as the next millennium approaches.
</P>
<P>
   In practical terms, Catholic and Lutheran officials said the
declaration about justification will ease tensions between the two
groups in regions like Latin America and Eastern Europe, while
encouraging broader cooperation, such as in shared social service
programs for the poor, in nations like the United States, where
relations between the churches are good.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from Rome where he attended the
announcement, Cardinal William Keeler, archbishop of Baltimore,
said, ``The big point is, we're announcing consensus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an agreement that is solid,'' he said. ``Cardinal Cassidy
made it clear that this is something that the church is not going
to step back from.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeler said condemnations between Catholics and Lutherans in the
16th century were based partly on stereotypes of each other. ``When
you get into a polarized situation, and just are talking at each
other, you don't really hear what each other is saying,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Luther, a German monk born in 1483, became convinced that
salvation was a divine gift that humans could not earn. Declaring
that he felt ``reborn'' by this realization, Luther also became
fiercely critical of the medieval church's practice of selling
``indulgences,'' by which believers understood they could purchase
a divine remission for sins.
</P>
<P>
   In 1517, he nailed his criticisms to a church door in
Wittenburg, Germany, a gesture considered the opening shot of the
Reformation.
</P>
<P>
   Brother Jeffrey Gros, a specialist in ecumenical affairs at the
National Conference of Catholic Bishops, said the joint declaration
would serve as an ``enormous encouragement'' to Catholics and
Lutherans already working together on social and religious projects
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He also said it was encouraging that the Vatican had called for
clarifications of parts of the declaration, rather than raising
outright objections.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from Cassidy's remarks, the Vatican's official statement
alternately praised and criticized the declaration. Although the
statement said ``a high degree of agreement has been reached'' in
the Catholic-Lutheran dialogue, it pointed out areas of serious
difference.
</P>
<P>
   The most important, according to the statement, is the Lutheran
belief that a person can be both forgiven by God and yet still be a
sinner. Catholics believe that a person, once forgiven, has an
inclination to sin, but is not permanently a sinner in God's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Lutherans approved the declaration on June 16, in a unanimous
decision of the governing council of the Lutheran World Federation.
The federation represents a large majority of Lutherans worldwide.
It does not include, for example, the Lutheran Church-Missouri
Synod.
</P>
<P>
   One council member, the Rev. Susan Nagle, pastor of First
Lutheran Church in Montclair, N.J., said that the work that went
into consideration of the joint declaration enhanced the role of
the federation among Lutherans worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within Lutheranism, something monumental has happened here,
not only with Roman Catholics, but with our understanding,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're beginning to see the Lutheran World Federation as a
communion of churches with authority to speak for each other,''
Pastor Nagle said.
</P>
<P>
   Momentum for the joint declaration had been building for years.
In part, the initiative can be traced to the spirit of engagement
between Catholics and other religious groups following the Second
Vatican Council in the early 1960s. &QL;

THE DUO BEHIND THE SUCCESS OF A SUBWAY TRAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``I can't believe how many people don't take the
local,'' Gregory Lombardi was saying Thursday at the Shea Stadium
subway station, getting ready for this weekend's Mets-Yankees
series. Lombardi is the car-equipment superintendent on the 7 line,
the best-liked and most efficient of the city's subway trains.
``It's only like a five-minute difference.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not even five,'' said Dennis Peppel, the line superintendent,
wearing his orange-mesh vest of authority. ``More like three and a
half.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Lombardi said. ``And people run for it even though
they won't get a seat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen people get off the local at Woodside, and walk
across the platform and wait for the express,'' Peppel said,
shaking his head in disbelief. ``The local is going to get there
before that express, but they give up a seat to stand in an express
that's crowded. I'll never figure that out. They have this
perception that they're zipping by all those stations, but when you
really look at the big picture, three and a half minutes is really
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   If it were any other line in the system, of course, this
discussion would be ridiculous. Only a mathematician could
appreciate the sense of random mystery that pervades most of the
New York City subway system, clouding any rational decisions about
whether to choose a local or an express. Locals often sweep by
crawling expresses; an express train will suddenly wind up on the
local tracks; a Broadway train will suddenly pull into Grand
Central with only the vaguest indications of its intentions.
</P>
<P>
   But not on the 7 line.
</P>
<P>
   There is a serene, almost Swiss regularity about the humble red
cars of the Flushing line, as if the subway system were having an
out-of-city experience. The line is perpendicular to Manhattan in
more ways than one: It has gone its own direction as far back as
1987, when it was first ranked the best, most reliable subway line
in the city by the Straphangers Campaign, an advocacy group. The
ranking was reconfirmed in a survey by the group that came out on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Peppel and Lombardi, who are the two officials most directly
responsible for this pre-eminence, are quick to point out that
there are a few historical factors at work. The line, unlike
virtually any other in the system, is a relatively short closed
loop, with no physical connection to any other tracks except for a
switch to the N line at Queensboro Plaza that is used only for
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   So, while delays on the C line will also affect the E, the 7 has
no other trains in its way that can damage its reliability rating.
Also, it is easier to pull 7 trains off the line for immediate
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   But the two men were the ones who were responsible for restoring
the line's fortunes after a dip in quality in the early 1990s.
Their boss, Joseph Hoffman, the Transit Authority's senior vice
president for subways, said they cooperate unusually well, working
together to solve the problems that often stymie other lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're only as good as your last rush hour,'' Hoffman said,
using the trainman's favorite aphorism, ``and these guys are as
dependable as they come.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lombardi, who describes himself as the Goodwrench of the 7, is
responsible for maintaining the line's 389 cars, which were built
for the 1964 World's Fair and were overhauled in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   They may not be as spacious or as spiffy as some of the newer
cars in the system, but the maintenance record of the rattling old
R-36 cars is better than those of all but the 4 line; cars on the 7
line break down about half as often as those on the A line, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   Lombardi volunteered for the job in 1992, just to show his
devotion to old rolling stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great job, and I've got a great staff,'' said Lombardi,
38, a Levittown resident whose grandfather was a dispatcher on the
Fulton Line and whose father is the subway's chief of operations.
``I get out there in the yard and it's like having my own personal
train set.''
</P>
<P>
   Peppel, 48, who also had a Lionel set as a kid (it is still in
the basement of his Woodhaven home), is responsible for keeping the
trains moving at a pace that exceeds almost any other. At rush
hour, the trains come through every 2.5 minutes, compared with a
system average of more than six minutes. With that kind of spacing,
a short delay causes immediate backups.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest problem is things I can't control, like sick
customers,'' he said. ``You don't want to get sick on my line from
Queensboro Plaza down, because I only have one track in each
direction, and we've got to start dumping people off at stations.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men are conscientious enough to ride the line regularly,
usually at the front window, soliciting comments from customers;
Lombardi listened carefully to the air brakes of passing trains
during an interview, writing down the numbers of maladjusted cars
for a later inspection.
</P>
<P>
   Both have worked their way up through the system since joining

TEXAS PAROLE BOARD RECOMMENDS LUCAS BE SPARED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In an unprecedented move, state parole officials
voted 17-1 Thursday to recommend sparing the life of Henry Lee
Lucas, once considered the most heinous serial killer in the nation
after he confessed to hundreds of murders.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles also voted to recommend
Lucas be granted a 270-day reprieve from his death sentence,
scheduled to be carried out Tuesday. It was unclear whether the
reprieve was recommended as an alternative to commutation.
</P>
<P>
   The matter now goes to Gov. George W. Bush, who can accept or
reject the board's recommendations. Bush, who was in Brownsville
for a meeting of U.S. and Mexican border state governors, said he
will ``carefully review and consider the recommendation'' and would
make his decision soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take every death-penalty case very seriously,'' Bush said.
``The first question I have in each death-penalty case is whether
there is any doubt about whether the individual is guilty of the
crime. While Henry Lee Lucas is guilty of committing a number of
horrible crimes, serious concerns have been raised about his guilt
in the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the board gave no specific reason for making its
recommendations, board Chairman Victor Rodriguez said a 1986
investigative report by then-Attorney General Jim Mattox carried
significant weight in swaying the board.
</P>
<P>
   That report, among other things, raised serious doubt about
whether Lucas is guilty of the Oct. 31, 1979, rape and
strangulation of an unidentified woman known only as ``Orange
Socks.'' &UR;  &LR; The case was named for the only item of clothing the
victim was wearing when her body was found in a ditch near
Georgetown, north of Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas confessed to the crime and was convicted in 1984. It is
the only case in which he received a death sentence, although he
has been convicted of 10 other murders and received life sentences
in six of those. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Although the parole board technically did not recommend what
lesser punishment Lucas should receive, Rodriguez wrote in a letter
to Bush that the murderer should never be released from prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to note that this person remains convicted of
this offense and as such should remain incarcerated for the rest of
his life,'' Rodriguez wrote Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe this person will ever be a free man,''
Rodriguez told reporters later. He added that he has informed
Lucas' lawyers that they fell far short of proving Lucas should be
pardoned.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's vote is believed to be the first time in the modern
era of the death penalty that the Texas parole board has
recommended a commutation of a death sentence on its own
initiative. Previous commutations have been granted only after
major changes in law or, in a few instances, after prosecutors
recommended the action because of trial flaws.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson County District Attorney Ken Anderson, whose
predecessor prosecuted the ``Orange Socks'' case, called Lucas ``a
monster'' and said he is disappointed by the parole board's action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucas was proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to 12
citizens. The case has been reviewed by 23 judges over the past 14
years,'' Anderson said. ``The only other reason to grant clemency
is for reasons of mercy. There is no one less deserving of such
than Lucas.''
</P>
<P>
   Rita Radostitz, one of Lucas' attorneys, said she was heartened
by the board's vote and hopes the governor follows the
recommendation. She agreed with Rodriguez' assessment that the
Lucas case is not likely to set a precedent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lucas case is unique in that the attorney general's office
investigation weighed heavily in it, and I don't think there will
be very many other cases in which the attorney general's office is
going to come out and say, `We think this guy is innocent,''' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mattox began his investigation into Lucas after news reports
questioned the veracity of some 600 killings around the country to
which he had confessed. They pointed out, for example, that work
records indicated Lucas might have been in Florida at the time of
the ``Orange Socks'' slaying. In other cases, investigators found
that Lucas was actually incarcerated at the same time he was to
have killed someone. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Lucas, who had gained national notoriety for his confessions,
later recanted most of them. He said law-enforcement officials fed
him details about crimes and let him read investigative reports
that allowed him to give explicit confessions, and in some cases,
point out where bodies had been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't view this as a win for Henry Lee Lucas,'' said Mattox,
who is seeking to be re-elected to the attorney general's post in
the November election. ``I view it as a win for our system of
justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the governor chooses to commute this sentence,'' he added,
``I'll be willing to stand up beside him (the governor), to defend
him any time, because it's the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Mattox believes it's unlikely Lucas committed the
murder for which he was sentenced to die, he also said Lucas is
guilty of other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a child molester, a thief. He's a murderer and he's also
a liar,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of people associated with this case at the
first, the task force and the first prosecutor, who kept saying
they thought they were handling the greatest mass murderer in the
history of the world,'' Mattox added. ``He was not.''
</P>
<P>
   Mattox says he now hopes that many of the cases that were
cleared based on Lucas' confessions will be reopened so
law-enforcement officers can find the real killers.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of some of the victims whose murders were attributed
to Lucas agreed. Joyce Lemons, whose daughter was murdered in
Lubbock on Aug. 24, 1975, two days after Lucas was released from
prison in Michigan, said it took her and her husband four years to
get their daughter's case reopened after Lucas confessed to it in
1982.
</P>
<P>
   Records in the case show that Lucas could not have been in
Lubbock at the time of the murder. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``Now we need to turn to the creators of Henry,'' Lemons said
Thursday, referring to the Texas Rangers task force that
coordinated Lucas' confessions. ``They belong behind bars.''
</P>
<P>
   Prison spokesman David Nunnelee said Lucas was ``upbeat''
Thursday and quoted him as saying the parole board's decision
``shows there's some justice in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas will remain housed on death row near Huntsville, pending
Bush's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Radostitz, Lucas' lawyer, described him as emotional after the
parole board's announcement, and said he sounded as if he were
crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he wasn't, but as I said, you can never believe
anything Henry says,'' Radostitz said in what may be a classic
understatement. ``It sounded like crying to me. He sounded tired
and he sounded a little bit like he didn't believe me.''

Astros' tour of Coors 
comes to a rocky end
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
DENVER _ Leave it to Derek Bell, who probably could find something
positive to say about an ingrown toenail, to find the silver lining
in the Astros' latest run of bad luck at Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least we don't have to come back here this year,'' Bell
said.
</P>
<P>
   That's about the only bright spot the Astros could take from
Denver after stubbing their toes yet again in a 6-5 loss to the
Colorado Rockies on Thursday. This one took 12 innings, but the
results were no different: thin air, dry heat _ Astros lose again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it is,'' a frustrated Jeff Bagwell said.
``It's not like we get overmatched up here. We just don't seem to
get any breaks. I do know one thing: Five or six runs is not enough
for us to win at this ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially when the Rockies trot to the mound a pitcher who is
making his major-league debut. Mike Saipe is no Kerry Wood, and his
5-5 Class AAA record and 4.06 ERA were hardly intimidating. But
dress him in a white baseball uniform with black pinstripes and
purple trim, and he gets a whole new set of credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Saipe didn't beat the Astros. But they didn't beat him either,
and that's what seemed to frustrate players and manager alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really thought we would be able to score some runs off
him,'' manager Larry Dierker said. ``He looked a little nervous,
and he wasn't throwing particularly hard. But for some reason, we
just couldn't get to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Saipe's debut overshadowed Lamar, Colo., native Scott Elarton's
first start in Coors Field, but it was utility player Kurt Abbott
who upstaged both rookie pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott's 12th-inning double off Mike Magnante drove home Vinny
Castilla for the winning run before 48,046 fans.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros lost both games in the two-game series, marking the
first time all season they have been swept in a series. While the
Astros have lost three in a row just once all year, they have lost
four of five at Coors Field and are 6-23 in Denver since the
Rockies entered the league.
</P>
<P>
   Saipe held the Astros to three runs in six innings and appeared
on his way to victory until Bell rejuvenated the Astros' hopes with
a game-tying two-run homer off Dave Veres in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't trying to change our luck here with one swing,'' Bell
said. ``I was just trying to help us win the game. I wasn't
thinking that might be the turning point for us, because I know how
bad our luck is in this park, and I knew the game wasn't over
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   It was over for the Astros' bats, which managed just one hit
after Bell's 10th home run denied ex-Astro Veres a second save in
as many days.
</P>
<P>
   Veres and Curtis Leskanic combined for three scoreless innings
after regulation, when the Astros put only one runner in scoring
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like runs are easy to score here until you need
them,'' Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros took a 2-0 lead in the third inning on Craig Biggio's
controversial two-run homer. The ball hit a fence behind the
outfield wall, and right fielder Dante Bichette played it off the
carom. Biggio thought it was a double until umpire Gerry Davis gave
the home-run signal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a perfect view of it,'' said Magnante, who was seated
in the bullpen. ``It was definitely a home run.''
</P>
<P>
   Bichette's RBI double got a run back for the Rockies in the
bottom of the inning, and Kirt Manwaring doubled home the tying run
in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros reclaimed a one-run lead when Saipe hit Moises Alou
with the bases loaded in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker was ripe for second-guessing in the sixth inning when
Elarton, who threw 113 pitches, allowed the first two batters to
reach base before he struck out Manwaring.
</P>
<P>
   Rockies manager Don Baylor sent lefthanded pinch-hit specialist
John Vander Wal to the plate to hit for Saipe, and Dierker could
have countered with lefty C.J. Nitkowski, who was warming up.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker decided to stick with Elarton, and the non-move
backfired when Vander Wal, who was hitless in his previous 18
pinch-hit at-bats, crushed a 1-1 changeup into the right-field
seats.
</P>
<P>
   The three-run homer and 5-3 lead held up until Bell's shot in
the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I considered C.J.,'' Dierker said. ``But he (Elarton) had
struck out the guy before Vander Wal and he was still throwing
hard. I thought he still had plenty of stuff left to get Vander Wal
out. The last time I took him out, the bullpen gave it (the lead)
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time, I decided to leave him in there and see if he could
get out of it. If this guy is going to be a horse for a while, he's
going to have to pitch 110 or so pitches sometimes. A lot of times,
you're going to pitch deep into games and you're not going to win.
But sometimes, you are.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just didn't work out this time, but I still thought Scott
pitched a good game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies' final push started with a perfectly executed
swinging bunt by slugging third baseman Vinny Castilla, of all
people.
</P>
<P>
   One batter later, Abbott smashed a pitch from Magnante off the
center-field wall. Carl Everett made a mad dash for the wall but
slipped at the warning track, ending any chance for a play at the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker didn't think Everett had a chance, but the Astros center
fielder wondered if things might have gone differently had he taken
a more cautious approach to the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I should have sat back and played it off the wall,''
said Everett, who has the strongest arm among the Astros'
outfielders. ``I was probably a little too aggressive. This is a
tough place to play defense because the gaps are so huge. But I
think if I could have gotten it cleanly off the wall, it might have
been a different story.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it was the same old story for the Astros at Coors
Field.

   Following is an excerpt from a Catholic and Lutheran declaration
on salvation:
</P>
<P>
   All persons depend completely on the saving grace of God for
their salvation. The freedom they possess in relation to persons
and the things of this world is no freedom in relation to
salvation, for as sinners they stand under God's judgment and are
incapable of turning by themselves to God to seek deliverance, of
meriting their justification before God, or of attaining salvation
by their own abilities. Justification takes place solely by God's
grace. &QL;

<P>
   Those Ladies Professional Golf Association players who competed
in the ShopRite Classic the last time it was held at Absecon, N.J.,
11 years ago will find that everything old is new again. The
Marriott Resort Bay course to which the tournament has returned has
undergone substantial renovations since it was last staged there in
1987.
</P>
<P>
   After the original blueprints of the Donald Ross-designed course
were found a few years ago, the resort decided to return the course
to its 1914 look.
</P>
<P>
   The small greens have been expanded without losing their
undulating surfaces and a number of holes have been put in their
original order. Over the years, members had changed the way the
course was played.
</P>
<P>
   In the 11 years in which the tournament was staged down the road
in Somers Point, it has gone from a tournament without a sponsor
and the smallest purse to the richest three-day event on the Ladies
Professional Golf Association tour. The three-day event, which
begins Friday, is now a $1 million tournament with $150,000 going
to the winner. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the
Constitution prohibited the president from rewriting legislation by
vetoing single items of spending or specific tax breaks approved by
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In a 6-3 decision, the court rejected a decades-old effort to
strengthen the hand of the president in struggles with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The court quoted George Washington, who presided over the
Constitutional Convention and later wrote that a president must
``approve all the parts of a bill, or reject it in toto,'' but
cannot modify the text of legislation presented to him by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The court's reasoning Thursday was exceptionally simple. ``The
President has amended two acts of Congress by repealing a portion
of each,'' said the majority opinion, by Justice John Paul Stevens.
``Repeal of statutes, no less than enactment, must conform with
Article I'' of the Constitution, which established ``a single
finely wrought and exhaustively considered procedure'' for enacting
laws.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Congress tried to change that procedure, and reduce the
budget deficit, by allowing the president to cancel individual
items of federal spending and tax breaks. But the court said
Thursday that such line-item vetoes were unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Line Item Veto Act authorizes the president himself to
effect the repeal of laws, for his own policy reasons, without
observing the procedures set out in Article I,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, traveling in China, said he was ``deeply
disappointed'' with the ruling. ``The decision is a defeat for all
Americans,'' Clinton said. ``It deprives the president of a
valuable tool for eliminating waste in the federal budget and for
enlivening the public debate over how to make the best use of
public funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has used the line-item veto to rewrite 11 laws,
eliminating 82 items, including money for New York City hospitals
and a tax break for Idaho potato growers.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's decision came in lawsuits filed by New York City, the
Greater New York Hospital Association, two unions of health-care
workers, the Snake River Potato Growers and one of its officers.
</P>
<P>
   In an opinion concurring with Stevens, Justice Anthony Kennedy
chided Congress for surrendering power to the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Failure of political will does not justify unconstitutional
remedies,'' Kennedy declared. ``Abdication of responsibility is not
part of the constitutional design.''
</P>
<P>
   The Line Item Veto Act was passed as part of the Republicans'
``Contract With America.'' Sixty-nine senators and more than 290
House members voted for it.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents since Ulysses Grant have sought the line-item veto,
and Ronald Reagan popularized the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said that the device ``compromises the political liberty
of our citizens'' by concentrating power in the hands of the
president. ``Liberty is always at stake when one or more of the
branches seek to transgress the separation of powers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The dissenters _ Justices Antonin Scalia, Stephen Breyer and
Sandra Day O'Connor _ would have upheld the line-item veto. Scalia
said that ``there is not a dime's worth of difference'' between
allowing the president to cancel a particular project, through the
line-item veto, and allowing him to spend money on a particular
item at his discretion.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Kennedy, Chief Justice William Rehnquist and
Justices David Souter, Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg
joined the majority opinion by Stevens in the case, Clinton vs.
City of New York, No. 97-1374.
</P>
<P>
   Two champions of the line-item veto, Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
and Daniel Coats, R-Ind., said they would keep fighting for it.
They have proposed an alternative, under which each item in an
omnibus appropriations bill would be submitted to the president as
a separate piece of legislation for him to sign or veto. Under this
arrangement, the president would receive thousands of bills each
year.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said the Line Item Veto Act ``gives the president the
unilateral power to change the text of duly enacted statutes.''
</P>
<P>
   In exercising the power, Clinton has infuriated members of
Congress, including many who supported the device in principle.
Conservative Republicans joined Democrats in complaining that
Clinton had killed worthy projects in their home states. In
February, Congress overturned the vetoes of 38 military
construction projects worth $287 million.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of money saved by Clinton's line-item vetoes is
difficult to calculate, but members of Congress said it was less
than 1 percent of the total federal budget of $1.6 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., the foremost opponent of the
line-item veto, was ecstatic Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great day for the United States of America, a great
day for the Constitution of the United States,'' Byrd said. ``Today
we feel that the liberties of the American people have been
assured. God save this honorable court!''
</P>
<P>
   In a dissenting opinion, Breyer said the line-item veto was an
acceptable ``experiment'' that did not ``threaten the liberties of
individual citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, who has served in the Senate for nearly 40 years,
disagreed. Byrd quoted Sir William Blackstone, the 18th century
English jurist, who wrote: ``In all tyrannical governments, the
supreme magistracy, or the right of both making and enforcing the
laws, is vested in one and the same man, or one and the same body
of men. And wherever these two powers are united together, there
can be no public liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd led six members of Congress in challenging the
constitutionality of the line-item veto last year, before Clinton
had used the device. In June 1997, the Supreme Court ruled that
there was no genuine ``case or controversy'' because the lawmakers
had not suffered any ``personal, concrete injury.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, by contrast, the court said that the New York
hospitals and the Idaho potato growers had suffered an ``actual
injury.'' Stevens said that the line-item veto, by creating a
potential liability of at least $2.6 billion for New York, could
harm the city's financial strength and borrowing power.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., rejoiced at the decision.
``In the history of Congress,'' Moynihan said, ``we have never had
an issue of such importance for the powers of the executive and
legislative branches. Liberty has prevailed.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the ruling, New York can keep all the federal
money it received for the care of poor people under Medicaid, and
Idaho potato growers can keep the tax break they received from
Congress. Under the Line Item Veto Act, the president could cancel
tax breaks that benefited fewer than 101 people.
</P>
<P>
   People affected by other line-item vetoes, including banks and
insurance companies and military contractors, will also benefit,
even though they did not challenge Clinton's actions in court.
</P>

   ``Everybody who was a victim should be standing in line at the
Treasury or some other agency to get their money or to file for a
tax refund if they've already paid taxes,'' said Alan Morrison, a
lawyer who filed a brief for three House Democrats opposed to the
line-item veto.
</P>
<P>
   One of those Democrats, Rep. David Skaggs of Colorado, said,
``The Supreme Court has saved Congress from itself.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 governors have some form of line-item veto, but the
power is usually granted by state constitutions, not just by state
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said the court was expressing ``no opinion about the
wisdom of the procedures authorized by the Line Item Veto Act.''
But, he said, if Congress wants to establish such procedures, it
must amend the federal Constitution.

BUS FARES FROM NEW JERSEY TO NEW YORK MAY RISE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Under increasing pressure from New York officials,
the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is edging toward
moves that could increase fares for bus and PATH train commuters
from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in 15 years, the authority is studying
whether to increase the fees charged to local buses arriving at its
bus terminal on Eighth Avenue. Officials at the authority, which is
known for being guarded about its intentions, hinted that the time
might be near for an increase in the PATH fare, which has stood at
$1 since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey officials bristled at any talk of raising the fares,
as they have since 1994, when New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani began
calling for the two-state authority to cut its subsidies to
operations that primarily benefit New Jersey residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the wrong time to talk about an increase in fares,'' said
Julie Plocinik, a spokeswoman for Gov. Christie Whitman of New
Jersey. ``It's a time when we should be encouraging more people to
use mass transit to take the strain off our already congested and
aging infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's transportation commissioner, John Haley Jr., who also
sits on the authority's board, said he would recommend that she
veto any increases. Whitman and Gov. George Pataki of New York have
veto power.
</P>
<P>
   In March, as part of a review it began last year of all its
operations, the authority began looking at the fees at the bus
terminal, which lost $50 million last year. The possible fee
increases were reported in The Star-Ledger of Newark on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Commuter buses, nearly all of them from New Jersey, make up
nearly two-thirds of the buses that come into the terminal, but
provide less than a quarter of its bus revenue. While local buses
pay a base fee of $1.74 per bus, medium- and long-distance buses
pay additional surcharges of up to 15 percent of their ticket
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Authority officials said the low fee charged to local buses was
meant to encourage mass transit. It has helped New Jersey Transit,
which runs more than half of the buses that come into the terminal,
to avoid a fare increase since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Port Authority officials said Thursday that they were preparing
a study to predict how many people would continue to ride buses
under several possible pricing plans.
</P>
<P>
   John Orcutt, associate director of the Tri-State Transportation
Campaign, a watchdog group, said that the Giuliani administration's
repeated calls for a fee increase, at a time when traffic in New
York is at record levels, are ``another absurd attack by New York
politicians on the cost of commuting from New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   But Peter Kalikow, an authority commissioner from New York City,
said that even if the authority increased its fees, New Jersey
Transit could avoid a fare increase by asking for more money from
the state.
</P>
<P>
   And Anthony Coles, a lawyer on Giuliani's staff, said that even
if buses became more expensive, ``It's a little silly to think that
a reasonable adjustment in the New Jersey Transit fare will cause
somebody to buy gas, pay a $4 toll and park in a garage at New York
City rates.''

SENATORS BOOST EFFORTS TO SAVE PUGET SOUND SALMON RUNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY, ROB TAYLOR and MICHAEL PAULSON.   
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Efforts to save endangered Puget Sound salmon runs have gotten a
boost from Washington's two U.S. senators, who have lined up almost
all of the $30 million in federal money that Washington Gov. Gary
Locke requested for a restoration effort.
</P>
<P>
   But under an appropriation bill that includes much of that $30
million, the federal government would be severely limited in what
it can do at dams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers to restore
endangered salmon runs _ largely because of efforts by Sen. Slade
Gorton, R-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   And the entire Interior Department appropriations bill, approved
Thursday by the Senate Appropriations Committee, is so loaded with
controversial measures that three Cabinet secretaries are
recommending that President Clinton veto it.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the bill is changed in conference committee, or
rewritten after a veto, the money for Puget Sound salmon is likely
to remain, Gorton indicated.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gorton and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., have been praised
for their efforts in obtaining the $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   Although providing money for Puget Sound efforts, the bill also
reflects Gorton's skepticism about salmon recovery upstream in the
Columbia River rystem, and particularly on the Snake River in
Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton, chairman of the Interior Appropriations subcommittee,
has continued his crusade to see that power generation, irrigation
and barge transportation are not damaged by measures designed to
get young salmon past a string of dams on the Columbia and Snake
rivers.
</P>
<P>
   The bill contains language that forbids the federal government
from taking any action that would ``remove, breach or diminish''
current uses at dams on the two rivers.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill also reflects an aggressive, bipartisan optimism
about moving to restore fish runs on rivers in the Puget Sound
basin and in southwest Washington. The National Marine Fisheries
Service proposed in February that Puget Sound chinook be listed
under the Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unlike the spotted owl. We are working ahead of the
curve to make sure that the endangered species listing doesn't come
down in a way that's detrimental to everybody,'' Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   King County Executive Ron Sims said he has secured agreement
from the Clinton administration to put additional money for salmon
recovery into its budgets for fiscal years 2000 and 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen the federal government work this well,''
Sims said. ``They are very concerned as to how a metropolitan area,
one of economic vitality, can respond to the Endangered Species Act
without sapping its growth and life.''
</P>
<P>
   Sims drew contrasts between the bipartisan unity seen in western
Washington and unending conflicts over the conflicting uses _
hydropower, irrigation, shipping and salmon _ on the Columbia
River.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Columbia you have never been able to get a common
ground,'' he said. ``Over here the common ground was established
very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The money in the Interior bill would go to the state, and then
be sent back to local governments and Indian tribes. It would go
directly and immediately to improving habitat and fish passage.
</P>
<P>
   In King, Pierce and Snohomish counties, federal money would go
for currently identified projects to restore critical streamside
habitat, marine wetlands, tidal fresh water wetlands, estuary, wide
channel and floodplain habitats, and to replace culberts.
</P>
<P>
   Money would be spent for habitat acquisition to protect key
streamside areas along major salmon streams, the Cedar and
Snoqualmie rivers as well as the Bear and Issaquah Creek
tributaries of the Sammamish River.
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan support for the Puget Sound effort gives it a
strong chance of remaining in any final measure.
</P>
<P>
   In another area of cooperation, Gorton has talked repeatedly
with Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt over ways of clearing up
disagreements on how to go about removing the Lower Elwha and
Glines Canyon dams from the Elwha River. Built more than 60 years
ago, without fish ladders, the dams destroyed the Olympic
Peninsula's greatest salmon fishery.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton has removed his previous insistence that the federal
government wait at least 12 years after removing the lower dam
before taking down the 210-foot-high Glines Canyon project, which
is the major barrier to miles of unspoiled salmon spawning habitat.
</P>
<P>
   But other provisions are highly controversial, and have led to a
veto threat by the Clinton administration. ``Unless this bill sees
some major revisions, it isn't going to make it through the
process,'' Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, and Energy
Secretary Federico Pena all would recommend Clinton veto the bill
as currently written, according to a letter sent from Acting Office
of Management and Budget Director Jacob Lew to Senate
Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The Cabinet secretaries objected to what they saw as not enough
money for endangered species programs, land acquisition, Bureau of
Indian Affairs education operations, the Clean Water Action Plan,
and a program to protect artifacts of national heritage.
</P>
<P>
   The administration said it ``strongly objects'' to a number of
riders, many of which concern policy in Alaska. They include
provisions that would mandate a high level of timber sales in the
Tongass National Forest, establish an easement to build a road
across the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge, prohibit the
regulation of commercial fishing in Glacier Bay National Park, and
place new limits on federal land acquisitions in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Another controversial area is the spending bill's provision to
terminate the Interior Columbia Basin Ecosystem Management Plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Columbia Basin Ecosystem Management Project aims to
use an exhaustive scientific assessment of the vast basin to help
determine how much grazing, logging, mining and other uses federal
lands can bear.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials say that without such broad, science-based
planning, their agencies run the risk of having logging, mining and
grazing shut down by lawsuits to protect endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   But rural industries are willing to take that chance. They fear
the ecosystem project will curb their use of federal lands and,
despite federal denials, might impact private land.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton said that even federal officials believed that the
ecosystem project was ``moving up a dead-end street.'' He said the
Senate bill would ``demand much more attention to local input.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray said she is concerned that the Interior spending bill _
by locking in current uses of dams _ would jeopardize one
successful effort to bring longterm peace to fisheries and power
management along the Columbia River.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the Clinton administration is due to sign a Habitat
Conservation Agreement with the Chelan and Douglas County public
utility districts. The utilities own three big power dams on the
mid-Columbia River.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement mandates that more than 90 percent of young salmon
survive passage through dams and reservoirs. But it leaves the
utilities with wide latitude on measures they will take at the dams
to assure salmon survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked very hard to put together the mid-Columbia habitat
conservation plan, and many people fear this bill's language (on
dams) could preclude the agreement from being implemented,'' Murray
said.

EDITORIAL: THE COURT VETOES LINE ITEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, June 26:
</P>
<P>
   In a sound and much-needed decision, the Supreme Court has
rejected the line-item veto as a departure from the basic
constitutional requirement that presidents accept or reject bills
in their entirety. The 6-3 decision, written by Justice John Paul
Stevens, firmly cast aside government arguments that in canceling
specific lines of the budget the president was merely exercising
authority delegated to him by Congress. Instead the court found
that the line-item veto violates the ```presentment clause'' of
Article I. That clause establishes the process by which a bill
becomes law.
</P>
<P>
   It is unfortunate that the majority opinion rests solely on the
procedural problem, never reaching the more profound constitutional
defect. The line-item veto is an affront to the separation of
powers and an abrogation of responsibility by Congress. That issue,
however, did get addressed eloquently in Justice Anthony Kennedy's
concurring opinion. ``By increasing the power of the president
beyond what the Framers envisioned,'' Kennedy wrote, ``the statute
compromises the political liberty of our citizens, liberty which
the separation of powers seeks to secure.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to this solid constitutional reasoning, the court
veered off course with a dangerous 8-1 ruling that found no First
Amendment violation in congressional efforts to control the
National Endowment for the Arts. The law in question ordered the
NEA to consider ``general standards of decency'' when making
grants. Conveniently misinterpreting the statue, Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor deemed its restrictive instructions to be merely ``an
advisory opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   In a powerful dissent, Justice David Souter scorched that
unrealistically benign view of what he aptly called ``a statutory
mandate to deny recognition to virtually any expression capable of
causing offense in any quarter.'' Some of the justices who joined
the majority may have been motivated by a desire to help protect
the NEA from further congressional attacks. But in all likelihood
this ruling will simply embolden enemies of government funding for
the arts. &QL;

EXCERPTS FROM HIGH COURT OPINIONS ON ARTS GRANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (with SCOTUS-RDP)  
 (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from Thursday's Supreme
Court ruling upholding a congressional decency test for awarding
federal arts grants. The opinion in the case, National Endowment
for the Arts vs. Karen Finley, was written by Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor and joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, and
Justices John Paul Stevens, Anthony M. Kennedy, Stephen G. Breyer
and, in part, Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Concurring in a second opinion
were Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. A dissenting
opinion was filed by Justice David H. Souter.
</P>
<P>
   FROM THE DECISION
</P>
<P>
   By Justice O'Connor
</P>
<P>
   Since 1965, the N.E.A. has distributed over $3 billion in grants
to individuals and organizations, funding that has served as a
catalyst for increased state, corporate, and foundation support for
the arts. . . . By far the largest portion of the grants
distributed in fiscal year 1998 were awarded directly to state arts
agencies. In the remaining categories, the most substantial grants
were allocated to symphony orchestras, fine arts museums, dance
theater foundations, and opera associations. Throughout the
N.E.A.'s history, only a handful of the agency's roughly 100,000
awards have generated formal complaints about misapplied funds or
abuse of the public's trust. . . . The four individual respondents
in this case, Karen Finley, John Fleck, Holly Hughes and Tim
Miller, are performance artists. . . . An advisory panel
recommended approval of respondents' projects, both initially and
after receiving (the former chairman of the N.E.A. John E.)
Frohnmayer's request to reconsider three of the applications. A
majority of the Council subsequently recommended disapproval, and
in June 1990, the N.E.A. informed respondents that they had been
denied funding. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Respondents raise a facial constitutional challenge . . . and
consequently they confront ``a heavy burden'' in advancing their
claim. . . . Facial invalidation ``is, manifestly, strong
medicine'' that ``has been employed by the Court sparingly and only
as a last resort.'' . . . To prevail, respondents must demonstrate
a substantial risk that application of the provision will lead to
the suppression of speech. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Respondents argue that the provision is a paradigmatic example
of viewpoint discrimination because it rejects any artistic speech
that either fails to respect mainstream values or offends standards
of decency. The premise of respondents' claim is that 954(d)(1)
constrains the agency's ability to fund certain categories of
artistic expression. The N.E.A., however, reads the provision as
merely hortatory, and contends that it stops well short of an
absolute restriction. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The ``decency and respect'' criteria do not silence speakers by
expressly ``threaten(ing) censorship of ideas.'' . . . Thus, we do
not perceive a realistic danger that 954(d)(1) will compromise
First Amendment values.
</P>
<P>
   As respondents' own arguments demonstrate, the considerations
that the provision introduces, by their nature, do not engender the
kind of directed viewpoint discrimination that would prompt this
Court to invalidate a statute on its face.
</P>
<P>
   Respondents assert, for example, that ``(o)ne would be
hard-pressed to find two people in the United States who could
agree on what the `diverse beliefs and values of the American
public' are, much less on whether a particular work of art
`respects' them''; and they claim that `` `(d)ecency' is likely to
mean something very different to a septuagenarian in Tuscaloosa and
a teen-ager in Las Vegas.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   Respondents' claim that the provision is facially
unconstitutional may be reduced to the argument that the criteria
in 954(d)(1) are sufficiently subjective that the agency could
utilize them to engage in viewpoint discrimination.....
</P>
<P>
   It is well established that ``decency'' is a permissible factor
where ``educational suitability'' motivates its consideration. . .
. Permissible applications of the mandate to consider ``respect for
the diverse beliefs and values of the American public'' are also
apparent.
</P>
<P>
   .... We recognize, of course, that reference to these
permissible applications would not alone be sufficient to sustain
the statute against respondents' First Amendment challenge. But
neither are we persuaded that, in other applications, the language
of 954(d)(1) itself will give rise to the suppression of protected
expression. Any content-based considerations that may be taken into
account in the grant-making process are a consequence of the nature
of arts funding. The N.E.A. has limited resources and it must deny
the majority of the grant applications that it receives, including
many that propose ``artistically excellent'' projects.
</P>
<P>
   FROM THE DISSENT
</P>
<P>
   By Justice Souter
</P>
<P>
   The question here is whether the italicized segment of this
statute is unconstitutional on its face: ``artistic excellence and
artistic merit are the criteria by which applications (for grants
from the National Endowment for the Arts) are judged, &UR; taking into
consideration general standards of decency and respect for the
diverse beliefs and values of the American public.''  &LR;  It is.
</P>
<P>
   The decency and respect proviso mandates viewpoint-based
decisions in the disbursement of government subsidies, and the
government has wholly failed to explain why the statute should be
afforded an exemption from the fundamental rule of the First
Amendment that viewpoint discrimination in the exercise of public
authority over expressive activity is unconstitutional. The Court's
conclusions that the proviso is not viewpoint based, that it is not
a regulation, and that the N.E.A. may permissibly engage in
viewpoint-based discrimination, are all patently mistaken.

EXCERPTS FROM SUPREME COURT OPINIONS IN HIV BIAS CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Maine)   (with SCOTUS-AIDS)  
 (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from Thursday's Supreme
Court ruling that people infected with HIV, the virus that causes
AIDS, are protected from discrimination under the Americans With
Disabilities Act even if they suffer no symptoms of AIDS. The
opinion, Randon Bragdon vs. Sidney Abbott, was written by Justice
Anthony M. Kennedy and joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, David
H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer. A dissenting
opinion was written by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
joined by Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Sandra Day
O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   FROM THE DECISION
</P>
<P>
   By Justice Kennedy
</P>
<P>
   Respondent Sidney Abbott has been infected with H.I.V. since
1986. When the incidents we recite occurred, her infection had not
manifested its most serious symptoms. On Sept. 16, 1994, she went
to the office of petitioner Randon Bragdon in Bangor, Me., for a
dental appointment. She disclosed her H.I.V. infection on the
patient registration form.
</P>
<P>
   Petitioner completed a dental examination, discovered a cavity,
and informed respondent of his policy against filling cavities of
H.I.V.-infected patients. He offered to perform the work at a
hospital with no added fee for his services, though respondent
would be responsible for the cost of using the hospital's
facilities. Respondent declined. Respondent sued petitioner
alleging discrimination on the basis of her disability. . . .
</P>
<P>
   We first review the ruling that respondent's H.I.V. infection
constituted a disability under the A.D.A. The statute defines
disability as:
</P>
<P>
   ``(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits
one or more of the major life activities of such individual;
</P>
<P>
   ``(B) a record of such an impairment; or
</P>
<P>
   ``(C) being regarded as having such impairment.''
</P>
<P>
   We hold respondent's H.I.V. infection was a disability under
subsection (A) of the definitional section of the statute. In light
of this conclusion, we need not consider the applicability of
subsections (B) or (C).
</P>
<P>
   Our consideration of subsection (A) of the definition proceeds
in three steps. First, we consider whether respondent's H.I.V.
infection was a physical impairment. Second, we identify the life
activity upon which respondent relies (reproduction and child
bearing) and determine whether it constitutes a major life activity
under the A.D.A. Third, tying the two statutory phrases together,
we ask whether the impairment substantially limited the major life
activity. In construing the statute, we are informed by
interpretations of parallel definitions in previous statutes and
the views of various administrative agencies which have faced this
interpretive question.
</P>
<P>
   The A.D.A.'s definition of disability is drawn almost verbatim
from the definition of ``handicapped individual'' included in the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the definition of ``handicap''
contained in the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988. Congress'
repetition of a well-established term carries the implication that
Congress intended the term to be construed in accordance with
pre-existing regulatory interpretations. In this case, Congress did
more than suggest this construction; it adopted a specific
statutory provision in the A.D.A. directing as follows:
</P>
<P>
   ``Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, nothing in this
chapter shall be construed to apply a lesser standard than the
standards applied under title V of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973
or the regulations issued by Federal agencies pursuant to such
title.''
</P>
<P>
   The directive requires us to construe the A.D.A. to grant at
least as much protection as provided by the regulations
implementing the Rehabilitation Act.
</P>
<P>
   The first step in the inquiry under subsection (A) requires us
to determine whether respondent's condition constituted a physical
impairment. The Department of Health, Education and Welfare
(H.E.W.) issued the first regulations interpreting the
Rehabilitation Act in 1977. The regulations are of particular
significance because, at the time, H.E.W. was the agency
responsible for coordinating the implementation and enforcement of
504. The H.E.W. regulations, which appear without change in the
current regulations issued by the Department of Health and Human
Services, define ``physical or mental impairment'' to mean:
</P>
<P>
   ``(A) any physiological disorder or condition, cosmetic
disfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting one or more of the
following body systems: neurological; musculoskeletal; special
sense organs; respiratory, including speech organs; cardiovascular;
reproductive, digestive, genito-urinary; hemic and lymphatic; skin;
and endocrine; or
</P>
<P>
   ``(B) any mental or psychological disorder, such as mental
retardation, organic brain syndrome, emotional or mental illness,
and specific learning disabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   In issuing these regulations, H.E.W. decided against including a
list of disorders constituting physical or mental impairments, out
of concern that any specific enumeration might not be
comprehensive. The commentary accompanying the regulations,
however, contains a representative list of disorders and conditions
constituting physical impairments, including ``such diseases and
conditions as orthopedic, visual, speech, and hearing impairments,
cerebral palsy, epilepsy, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis,
cancer, heart disease, diabetes, mental retardation, emotional
illness, and drug addiction and alcoholism.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   H.I.V. infection is not included in the list of specific
disorders constituting physical impairments, in part because H.I.V.
was not identified as the cause of AIDS until 1983. . . .
</P>
<P>
   In light of the immediacy with which the virus begins to damage
the infected person's white blood cells and the severity of the
disease, we hold it is an impairment from the moment of infection.
As noted earlier, infection with H.I.V. causes immediate
abnormalities in a person's blood, and the infected person's white
cell count continues to drop throughout the course of the disease,
even when the attack is concentrated in the lymph nodes. In light
of these facts, H.I.V. infection must be regarded as a
physiological disorder with a constant and detrimental effect on
the infected person's hemic and lymphatic systems from the moment
of infection. H.I.V. infection satisfies the statutory and
regulatory definition of a physical impairment during every stage
of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The statute is not operative, and the definition not satisfied,
unless the impairment affects a major life activity. Respondent's
claim throughout this case has been that the H.I.V. infection
placed a substantial limitation on her ability to reproduce and to
bear children. Given the pervasive, and invariably fatal, course of
the disease, its effect on major life activities of many sorts
might have been relevant to our inquiry. Respondent and a number of
amici make arguments about H.I.V.'s profound impact on almost every
phase of the infected person's life. In light of these submissions,
it may seem legalistic to circumscribe our discussion to the
activity of reproduction. We have little doubt that had different
parties brought the suit they would have maintained that an H.I.V.
infection imposes substantial limitations on other major life
activities.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, however, the case has been treated as one in
which reproduction was the major life activity limited by the
impairment. It is our practice to decide cases on the grounds
raised and considered in the Court of Appeals and included in the
question on which we granted certiorari. We ask, then, whether
reproduction is a major life activity.
</P>
<P>
   We have little difficulty concluding that it is. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Conception and childbirth are not impossible for an H.I.V.
victim but, without doubt, are dangerous to the public health. This
meets the definition of a substantial limitation. The decision to
reproduce carries economic and legal consequences as well. There
are added costs for antiretroviral therapy, supplemental insurance,
and long-term health care for the child who must be examined and,
tragic to think, treated for the infection. The laws of some
states, moreover, forbid persons infected with H.I.V. from having
sex with others, regardless of consent. . . .
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the disability definition does not turn on personal
choice. When significant limitations result from the impairment,
the definition is met even if the difficulties are not
insurmountable. For the statistical and other reasons we have
cited, of course, the limitations on reproduction may be
insurmountable here. Testimony from the respondent that her H.I.V.
infection controlled her decision not to have a child is
unchallenged. . . . Respondent's H.I.V. infection is a physical
impairment which substantially limits a major life activity, as the
A.D.A. defines it. In view of our holding, we need not address the
second question presented, i.e., whether H.I.V. infection is a per
se disability under the A.D.A. . . .
</P>
<P>
   One comprehensive and significant administrative precedent is a
1988 opinion issued by the Office of Legal Counsel of the
Department of Justice (O.L.C.) concluding that the Rehabilitation
Act ``protects symptomatic and asymptomatic H.I.V.-infected
individuals against discrimination in any covered program.'' . . .
O.L.C. determined further that asymptomatic H.I.V. imposed a
substantial limit on the major life activity of reproduction. The
opinion said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the medical knowledge available to us, we believe
that it is reasonable to conclude that the life activity of
procreation is substantially limited for an asymptomatic
H.I.V.-infected individual. In light of the significant risk that
the AIDS virus may be transmitted to a baby during pregnancy,
H.I.V.-infected individuals cannot, whether they are male or
female, engage in the act of procreation with the normal
expectation of bringing forth a healthy child.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   We conclude the proper course is to give the Court of Appeals
the opportunity to determine whether our analysis of some of the
studies cited by the parties would change its conclusion that
petitioner presented neither objective evidence nor a triable issue
of fact on the question of risk. In remanding the case, we do not
foreclose the possibility that the Court of Appeals may reach the
same conclusion it did earlier. A remand will permit a full
exploration of the issue through the adversary process.
</P>
<P>
   The determination of the Court of Appeals that respondent's
H.I.V. infection was a disability under the A.D.A. is affirmed. The
judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion.
</P>
<P>
   (EXCERPTS FROM DISSENT FOLLOW IN 3rd TAKE)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   FROM THE DISSENT
</P>
<P>
   By Chief Justice Rehnquist
</P>
<P>
   The A.D.A.'s definition of a ``disability'' requires that the
major life activity at issue be one ``of such individual.'' The
Court truncates the question, perhaps because there is not a shred
of record evidence indicating that, prior to becoming infected with
H.I.V., respondent's major life activities included reproduction
(assuming for the moment that reproduction is a major life activity
at all). At most, the record indicates that after learning of her
H.I.V. status, respondent, whatever her previous inclination,
conclusively decided that she would not have children. There is
absolutely no evidence that, absent the H.I.V., respondent would
have had or was even considering having children. Indeed, when
asked during her deposition whether her H.I.V. infection had in any
way impaired her ability to carry out any of HER life functions,
respondent answered ``No.'' It is further telling that in the
course of her entire brief to this Court, respondent studiously
avoids asserting even once that reproduction is a major life
activity TO HER. To the contrary, she argues that the ``major life
activity'' inquiry should not turn on a particularized assessment
of the circumstances of this or any other case.
</P>
<P>
   But even aside from the facts of this particular case, the Court
is simply wrong in concluding as a general matter that reproduction
is a ``major life activity.'' Unfortunately, the A.D.A. does not
define the phrase ``major life activities.'' But the Act does
incorporate by reference a list of such activities contained in
regulations issued under the Rehabilitation Act. The Court
correctly recognizes that this list of major life activities ``is
illustrative, not exhaustive,'' but then makes no attempt to
demonstrate that reproduction is a major life activity in the same
sense that ``caring for one's self, performing manual tasks,
walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and
working'' are.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Court argues that reproduction is a ``major'' life
activity in that it is ``central to the life process itself.'' . .
. In support of this reading, the Court focuses on the fact that
``major'' ``indicates comparative importance,'' . . . ignoring the
alternative definition of ``major'' as ``greater in quantity,
number, or extent.'' It is the latter definition that is most
consistent with the A.D.A.'s illustrative list of major life
activities.
</P>
<P>
   No one can deny that reproductive decisions are important in a
person's life. But so are decisions as to who to marry, where to
live, and how to earn one's living. Fundamental importance of this
sort is not the common thread linking the statute's listed
activities. The common thread is rather that the activities are
repetitively performed and essential in the day-to-day existence of
a normally functioning individual. They are thus quite different
from the series of activities leading to the birth of a child.
</P>
<P>
   Both respondent and the United States as amicus curiae, argue
that reproduction must be a major life activity because regulations
issued under the A.D.A. define the term ``physical impairment'' to
include physiological disorders affecting the reproductive system.
If reproduction were not a major life activity, they argue, then it
would have made little sense to include the reproductive disorders
in the roster of physical impairments. This argument is simply
wrong. There are numerous disorders of the reproductive system,
such as dysmenorrhea and endometriosis, which are so painful that
they limit a woman's ability to engage in major life activities
such as walking and working. And, obviously, cancer of the various
reproductive organs limits one's ability to engage in numerous
activities other than reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   But even if I were to assume that reproduction IS a major life
activity of respondent, I do not agree that an asymptomatic H.I.V.
infection ``substantially limits'' that activity. The record before
us leaves no doubt that those so infected are still entirely able
to engage in sexual intercourse, give birth to a child if they
become pregnant, and perform the manual tasks necessary to rear a
child to maturity. While individuals infected with H.I.V. may
choose not to engage in these activities, there is no support in
language, logic, or our case law for the proposition that such
voluntary choices constitute a ``limit'' on one's own life
activities.
</P>
<P>
   The Court responds that the A.D.A. ``addresses substantial
limitations on major life activities, not utter inabilities.'' I
agree, but fail to see how this assists the Court's cause. Apart
from being unable to demonstrate that she is utterly unable to
engage in the various activities that comprise the reproductive
process, respondent has not even explained how she is less able to
engage in those activities.
</P>
<P>
   Respondent contends that her ability to reproduce is limited
because ``the fatal nature of H.I.V. infection means that a parent
is unlikely to live long enough to raise and nurture the child to
adulthood.'' But the A.D.A.'s definition of a disability is met
only if the alleged impairment substantially ``limits'' (present
tense) a major life activity. Asymptomatic H.I.V. does not
presently limit respondent's ability to perform any of the tasks
necessary to bear or raise a child. Respondent's argument, taken to
its logical extreme, would render every individual with a genetic
marker for some debilitating disease ``disabled'' here and now
because of some possible future effects.
</P>
<P>
   In my view, therefore, respondent has failed to demonstrate that
any of her major life activities were substantially limited by her
H.I.V. infection.

   NEW YORK _ The chief rabbi of Moscow, PINCHAS GOLDSCHMIDT, is
taking home $3,600 to help rebuild Moscow's Lubavitch synagogue,
which was damaged by a bomb last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gift is somewhat nostalgic,'' said RABBI MARC SCHNEIER,
the president of the New York Board of Rabbis, who gave the money
for the Marina Roshche synagogue to Goldschmidt on Thursday. ``It
conjures up all these memories for me of 26 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Schneier had a bar mitzvah in 1972 at Moscow Choral Synagogue,
the only synagogue in operation there at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember after speaking to the congregation and seeing many
of these congregants just overwhelmed by a 13-year-old young man
who was well versed in Hebrew, in Jewish learning,'' Schneier said.
``Twenty-six years later, that's commonplace there, a daily
occurrence in Moscow.'' Goldschmidt said that Moscow has 13
synagogues now.
</P>
<P>
   It's a Nice Song If You Can Get It
</P>
<P>
   BOB MERRILL is crazy for voice mail.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill, a trumpeter and bandleader, had been hired to play at
the wedding of REGEN HORCHOW and JEFF FEARON on Nantucket, Mass.
The requests for Gershwin tunes started coming even before he left
New York _ no surprise, considering that Ms. Horchow's father,
ROGER HORCHOW, was a producer of the all-Gershwin musical ``Crazy
for You.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted `I Can't Be Bothered Now,' which was a
stump-the-band thing for me,'' Merrill said. ``I was going to try
to get the music, but Sam Ash was closed for the day.''
</P>
<P>
   So he called ERIC COMSTOCK, a singer and cabaret historian, and
left a message.
</P>
<P>
   Comstock returned the call, telling Merrill's answering machine
that he did not have sheet music for ``I Can't Be Bothered Now.''
``I learned it by ear,'' Comstock said. ``From an Astaire movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill called and left this message: ``Call back and play it on
my machine.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Merrill landed on Nantucket, he checked his machine.
Sure enough, there was a message from Comstock. In fact, there were
two. ``The first time he did it, he got cut off,'' Merrill said,
who transcribed the melody and arranged it.
</P>
<P>
   The review? ``They loved it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking Edina's Mold
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ She's sweet, she's darling, but don't call LYNNE
FRANKS ``sweetie darling.'' At least, not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Franks is the pioneering English fashion publicist who
claims to be the prototype for Edina, the pioneering English
fashion publicist on the BBC sitcom ``Absolutely Fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Ms. Franks has written a book, ``Absolutely Now: A
Futurist's Journey to Her Inner Truth'' (Overlook Press), a
blueprint for entrepreneurs who want to follow in her footsteps. As
she explained it at a party at a Benetton store at 597 Fifth Ave.,
it advises simplifying one's life and sharing one's expertise.
</P>
<P>
   The similarities between Ms. Franks and Edina are, as one or the
other (but probably Edina) might say, really quite freaky, darling.
Both hobnobbed with fledgling fashion designers and British
nobility in the 1980s. Both are divorced, with children. Both
became followers of Buddhism. And both possess whatever the English
call chutzpah.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one striking difference: Edina remains trapped in
cable reruns. Ms. Franks fled, divorcing her husband, selling her
business and moving to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   JENNIFER SAUNDERS, the sitcom's creator and a former client of
Ms. Franks, did not return calls for comment. She has been quoted
as saying that Edina was not modeled on Ms. Franks. ``She has to
say that or I could sue,'' Ms. Franks said. ``Not that I would, of
course.''
</P>
<P>
   Campfire Without Fire
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ PETER, PAUL and MARY are scheduled to perform at a
``campfire sing-along'' for the New York City Parks Foundation on
Monday evening in Central Park. Don't look for a real campfire.
What will be blowing in the wind will be a ``faux fire,'' as their
spokesman describes it. The flames will be made of orange silk and
will be fanned by an electric fan. ``Fire Department regulations,''
the spokesman, ANDY MORRIS, explained.
</P>
<P>
   An Updated Rhett
</P>
<P>
   ``Gone With the Wind'' has gone high-tech, with a Web site
(www.franklymydear.com). ``In trying to get someone who would see
`Pulp Fiction' to come and see `Gone With the Wind,''' said GORDON
PADDISON, who oversees the site for New Line Cinema, ``we tried to
translate it into this medium and break it to a new, young, hip,
edgy audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of long, tedious paragraphs, the site offers Rhett
Butler and Scarlett O'Hara postcards that users can send by e-mail.
Visitors to the site can also vote on which actors they would cast
if ``Gone With the Wind'' were being remade. As of Thursday, TOM
SELLECK was leading HARRISON FORD by 700 votes in the balloting for
Rhett, and NICOLE KIDMAN was 173 votes ahead of KATE WINSLET. And
91 people had voted for RUPAUL.

FEAR OF DEPORTATION CITED IN IMMIGRANT'S DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Philippines)  (ja) 
 By DAVID ROHDE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An illegal immigrant who may have been afraid to report to the
police that she was being abused by her former boyfriend was found
dead in the basement of her Englewood, N.J., apartment Thursday,
officials said. Prosecutors say that they believe the man killed
her, but that he has apparently fled the country.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the woman, Alena Gonzales, a 36-year-old mother
of two from the Philippines who disappeared Saturday night, had
tried to break off her relationship with the man, 32-year-old Fredy
Bustamanti, and was engaged to another man, Peter Bartells.
Bartells reported her missing to the Englewood police on Sunday
after she failed to show up for a date Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Ms. Gonzales said that Bustamanti repeatedly beat her
over the course of an eight-year-relationship and threatened to
report her to immigration officials if she reported his actions.
They said that after Ms. Gonzales began seeing another man,
Bustamanti repeatedly threatened to kill her, her boyfriend and
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fredy was always physically abusive and violent with her,''
said Susan Goodman, a friend of Ms. Gonzales. ``She is illegal
herself and she always had this fear of being deported.''
</P>
<P>
   After receiving a tip Thursday, the police discovered Ms.
Gonzales' body in the basement of the apartment building in which
she and Bustamanti lived at 26 W. Palisades Ave., Englewood's main
commercial thoroughfare. The Bergen County prosecutor, William
Schmidt, said the autopsy results showed that Ms. Gonzales was
strangled to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``An object was used to effect the strangulation and the
asphyxiation,'' he said, adding that the police were not sure
exactly where Ms. Gonzales was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt said investigators believe Bustamanti, who worked for
Campoli Construction in Cresskill, N.J., flew to his native
Guatemala on Saturday. He said Bustamanti's estranged wife had once
filed a domestic abuse complaint against him.
</P>
<P>
   Violeta Hernandes, 30, the landlord of the Palisades Avenue
building, said Bustamanti had moved in about three years ago. He
then asked her if Ms. Gonzales, the mother of twin 12-year-old
girls still in the Philippines, could move into a $250 room in the
building.
</P>
<P>
   She said the couple looked ``happy'' and that she never saw any
hitting in the relationship, and added that she was ``very
surprised'' by the allegations against Bustamanti.
</P>
<P>
   But Schmidt said Ms. Gonzales' friends told prosecutors the
relationship was ``not a good one.'' When asked whether the
relationship was violent he said yes.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt said ``the vast majority'' of homicides prosecutors see
in Bergen County are the result of ``violent relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that Ms. Gonzales' plight was not unusual and that
illegal immigrants frequently hesitate to report domestic abuse.
They are also threatened with exposure to immigration officials by
bosses or people with whom they get involved in disputes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very common,'' said Mimi Kuo, a counselor who has dealt
with issues of sexual assault in the Asian community. ``There's a
lot of silence around this issue. It's only when something as
drastic as this happens that the issue gets the attention it
deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gonzales' friend Ms. Goodman said that Ms. Gonzales had
arrived in the United States about 10 years ago and had held a
variety of jobs as a housekeeper. Her earnings here went primarily
to supporting her two daughters and her 65-year-old mother in the
Philippines.

MOTHER CHARGED WITH KILLING TWO OF HER CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By DUAYNE DRAFFEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMITYVILLE, N.Y. _ Two children were found dead in their home in
this Suffolk County village by the police early Thursday morning,
and their 31-year-old mother has been charged with killing them.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said that the mother, Debra Roberson, 31,
called relatives shortly after midnight and told them the children
were dead. Her relatives called the police, and two police officers
went to Ms. Roberson's apartment at 505 Broadway about 1 a.m. When
no one answered repeated knocks and calls, they broke in the door,
the police said. In one room of the three-room apartment, they
said, they found Ms. Roberson standing over her dead children,
Melvin King, 5, and his sister, Delvin King, 6.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, the police said the cause of death seemed to be
burns from scalding hot water. Both children had extensive burns on
their bodies and arms, and Melvin had burns on his face and head as
well, the police said. The children had been dead ``for some time''
before the police arrived, said Detective Lt. John Gierasch,
commander of the Suffolk County Homicide Squad. Ms. Roberson's
7-month-old son, Hasson, was found sleeping and unharmed in another
room, the police said, and he is now with relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Gierasch said Ms. Roberson would be held overnight at the Fourth
Precinct headquarters in Hauppauge and would be arraigned Friday
morning in First District County Court in Central Islip on two
second-degree murder charges. She had no previous police record, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said that there had been a few complaints about
drug sales from another apartment in the three-story house, but
that over all there had been very little crime in that area of
Amityville.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roberson had moved into the front apartment of the well-kept
white house with green trim just north of the Sunrise Highway about
four months ago, the police said. Neighbors said her children were
always nicely dressed and seemed well cared for.
</P>
<P>
   One neighbor, Frances Taylor, said that she often saw Ms.
Roberson playing outdoors with her children and that they seemed
happy. ``She was always with them, laughing and having little
picnics in the front yard,'' Ms. Taylor said. ``There was no sign
of something like this about to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   A next-door neighbor, who said her children often played with
Melvin and Delvin, said: ``They were good kids and didn't get into
trouble. They never said anything bad about their mother, either.''
The woman, who refused to give her name, said she had not seen the
children for about a week, and some of their classmates at
Northeast Elementary School said the King children had not been in
class for about that length of time.
</P>
<P>
   The police said they were investigating reports by at least one
neighbor that Ms. Roberson had been acting strangely in the last
two days, keeping her blinds down and repeatedly crossing herself
as she stood at a window.

GOVERNOR FACES OPPOSITION TO PROPOSED GAS-TAX RISE
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By JENNIFER PRESTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Republican lawmakers in the General Assembly are
considering tapping the state's $661 million budget surplus to help
pay for transportation projects rather than support Gov. Christie
Whitman's proposal to raise the gasoline tax by 5 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   The growing opposition among Whitman's fellow Republicans in the
Assembly to an increase in the gasoline tax for transportation
improvements comes less than a week after lawmakers rejected her
plan for a 2-cents-a-gallon increase to help pay for the
preservation of open space and farmland.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman has proposed putting the question of the gasoline tax
increase on the ballot for voters to consider this fall. Lacking
legislative support for a tax increase for open space, Whitman and
legislative leaders are now planning to borrow more than $1 billion
over the next 30 years to help preserve 1 million acres of open
space in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said Thursday, however, that she remains firmly
committed to a 5-cents-a gallon gasoline tax increase for
transportation projects. But some Republican lawmakers are now
saying the state should consider other options to pay for mass
transit and highway improvements, including borrowing money and
paying for the borrowing out of the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Assembly is currently looking for alternatives to the
governor's plan,'' said Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, R-Salem
County. ``That doesn't mean that the governor's plan is not the one
we are going to end up with.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said that he believed that there was strong support in
the Assembly for spending more money on transportation projects
despite opposition from some Assembly members over putting a
gasoline tax on the ballot this year.
</P>
<P>
   In the Republican-controlled state Senate, there is more support
for the governor's proposal for a gasoline tax referendum. A bill
has been introduced with bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it could pass the Senate to put it on the ballot,''
said Senate President Donald DiFrancesco, R-Scotch Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said Thursday that she was continuing to push for the
nickel increase. She described the proposal to use the budget
surplus, a ``Band-Aid approach.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a time for leadership and the acknowledgment that we
have needs,'' Whitman said. ``We have infrastructure needs in the
state of New Jersey that should not be addressed in a piecemeal
fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Richard Bagger, a Republican and the chairman of the
Assembly Budget and Appropriations Committee, said that Republican
members of the caucus were deeply divided over the issue. ``There
is a wide divergence of opinion,'' said Bagger, who supports the
governor's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the General Assembly are up for re-election next
year, causing some to worry that supporting a gasoline tax increase
could hurt them at the polls with tax-weary voters. Senators are
not up for re-election until 2001.

GORE, MAURO WARM UP FOR TEXAS DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL PASO, Texas _ In a warm-up for their joint appearance Friday
night at the State Democratic Convention, Vice President Al Gore
joined gubernatorial candidate Garry Mauro on a campaign stop
Thursday designed to capitalize on the historic strength here of
Mauro and his party.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Republicans said the Democrats' visions of a Mauro victory,
either statewide or in El Paso, were just another desert mirage.
They predicted Gov. George W. Bush would become the first
Republican gubernatorial contender to carry this west Texas border
city, despite Bush's controversial stances on hot-button topics
involving gambling and radioactive waste.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who spent part of the day in Houston, met with El Paso
educators and dignitaries before rallying Mauro supporters at a
$500-per-person dinner. That event was expected to generate
$150,000 for Mauro's campaign, which earlier this week got an
estimated $250,000 boost from a Washington, D.C., event attended by
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   While the incoming dollars could help Mauro buy media exposure
for his underdog campaign, aides said Mauro will tell party
loyalists at the state convention that it's time for Democrats to
think in unconventional terms about capturing November votes.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic convention opens Friday in San Antonio, with
6,500 delegates and 2,200 alternates gathering to elect a new
chairman, adopt a campaign platform and listen to speeches from
statewide candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the list of speakers are Gore, civil rights leader Jesse
Jackson and Houston Mayor Lee Brown, who was elected in a
nonpartisan election. But Brown, an African-American who served in
the Democratic Clinton administration, is expected to discuss his
winning campaign strategy to the black and Hispanic caucuses of the
state party.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing a successor to outgoing state party Chairman Bill
White of Houston, Democrats will choose between Molly Beth Malcolm
of Texarkana, a former Republican who joined the Democrats with a
convert's fervor and now leads Texas Democratic Women; and San
Augustine County Judge Curt Goetz, who made his first Democratic
political speeches as a child campaigning in his father's state
representative race.
</P>
<P>
   In El Paso, Mauro has pointed out that Bush has criticized the
Speaking Rock Casino, operated by the Tigua Indians, and that Bush
supports plans of the Texas Low-level Radioactive Waste Disposal
Authority to open a facility near Sierra Blanca.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro aides claimed Bush is threatening 900 jobs at the casino
and is endangering the environment in Texas and Mexico by
supporting the disposal site. Mauro's camp also accuses Bush of
having only a superficial interest in El Paso, as opposed to the
long-standing ties Mauro developed as land commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Governor Bush and his political operatives to talk about
winning El Paso is a little like Garry Mauro saying he's going to
win The Woodlands,'' Rogers said. ``The bottom line is Garry has
always done well in El Paso. He's always done 60 percent-plus and
he'll do 60 percent-plus again. He will do much better than Ann
Richards did last time,'' Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   El Paso County was one of the few bright spots for Richards in
her 1994 defeat by Bush. She outpolled Bush 50,560 to 40,011.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro is hoping that his role in advocating veterans' housing
and land programs will help him in this community of more than
600,000 people, which has sizable military populations because of
nearby Fort Bliss. The county has 325,127 registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrat also hopes voters associate him with clean-burning
fuels, which he likewise has promoted as land commissioner since
1983. Air pollution _ much of it wafting across the Rio Grande from
Ciudad Juarez, Mexico _ is a major annoyance in El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Bush predicts he will dominate in November here, and a
Texas Poll earlier this month gave his prediction credence. In the
55-county West Texas region, 78 percent of the respondents backed
Bush compared to 13 percent for Mauro. It was Bush's best regional
performance in the state _ and Mauro's worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should whup me in El Paso. It's been a Democratic
stronghold a long time,'' Bush said. ``But I feel like I've got a
good chance to do well this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of El Paso know I care about their community,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Mauro's aides are wrong that he wants to close down
the Tigua casino, although he is opposed to outlawed games known as
8-liners.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want to do is enforce the law, and if the law says that
a game is illegal, then I think we ought to make sure the game does
not go forward. I've never said I want to shut down the casino,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also bristled at Mauro's suggestion that the low-level
waste site 60 miles southeast of El Paso will harm Texas and
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the site is deemed safe, I support it,'' Bush said, noting
that the site's licensing process is incomplete.

NORMAN WATERS, 92, PIONEER AD EXECUTIVE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN.: Conn.)  (ja) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Norman D. Waters, who owned an advertising agency
bearing his name and who in 1941 produced the first fashion show
broadcast on television, died Tuesday at Osborn Retirement
Community in Rye, his daughter, Elizabeth Waters Haron, said. He
was 92.
</P>
<P>
   Waters was an early champion of television, saying it would
``exert a greater influence on fashion than any factor yet known''
and trying throughout World War II to get the government to use
broadcasting to make training efficient.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1941 he produced ``Five O'Clock Party,'' a playlet
sponsored by Abraham &AMP; Straus and Bloomingdale's that was staged to
show off women's fashions. The show was one of 17 staged at Radio
City that were broadcast by WNBT (now WNBC), National Broadcasting
Co.'s station.
</P>
<P>
   Waters also produced ``The Arthur Murray Party,'' a precursor of
today's infomercials that sought to attract clients to the chain of
dance schools by entertaining people with dancing on television. He
was also the first president of the American Television Society.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his daughter, Elizabeth, of Greenwich, Conn.,
Waters is survived by his wife of 70 years, Elaine Lion Waters; one
son, Sanford, of Hastings-on-Hudson; five grandchildren and five
great-grandchildren.

ROSE BOWL DIALS AT&AMP;T FOR SPONSOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Granddad looks different. Nose ring. Watching the X-Games. He's
running with a different crowd, too. A big-money bunch. Now we find
out he's seeing another woman. Name used to be Ma Bell. It's not
love, but a match of convenience.
</P>
<P>
   The Rose Bowl nobly calls itself the Granddaddy Of Them All.
And, with a tradition that dates to 1902, the title is appropriate
and correct. But in the past decade the Old Guy has been through
more changes than a Las Vegas showgirl.
</P>
<P>
   The Rose Bowl and ABC Sports, its television partner, announced
Thursday that AT&AMP;T will be the game's corporate sponsor for four
years. That announcement should be no surprise given the computers,
cars and cellular phones whose names litter college football's
postseason marquee.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the fact that the Rose Bowl has given in to crass
corporate culture is yet another sign of changing times in the bowl
business. The group that runs the Rose Bowl is second only to The
Masters when it comes to equal parts hallowed tradition and snooty
arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rose Bowl has been forced to change. Ten years ago, it
switched from NBC to ABC for more money. Two years ago, it agreed
to join the Bowl Championship Series when Big Ten and Pacific-10
coaches claimed a recruiting disadvantage because they felt locked
out of the national championship picture created by the bowl
alliance.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Rose steps down off its pedestal to join the
Fiesta, the Orange and the Sugar in the Bowl Championship Series
rotation. If a Pac-10 or Big Ten team has a shot at the national
championship, which has been the case the past two years, the Rose
won't have its traditional game between the Big Ten and Pac-10
champs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're proud to be part of giving the public what it wants, No.
1 vs. No. 2,'' said Harriman Cronk of the Rose Bowl executive
committee, which will play host to the championship series title
game in 2002. ``I think we have the best of both worlds. Can you
imagine what it would be like to invite Notre Dame? It will be very
exciting the first time we have an opportunity to bring in somebody
different.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Rose joined the series fold two years ago, it was
apparent that a corporate sponsorship was necessary. Ticket prices
for the Rose Bowl have nearly doubled in recent years. The prices
will increase from $75 this year to $110 for the 1999 game,
increasing revenue to about $11 million.
</P>
<P>
   But with the series bowls paying about $12 million per team, the
Rose and ABC needed another revenue stream.
</P>
<P>
   ``A corporate sponsorship wasn't a condition of the Rose Bowl
becoming part of the Bowl Championship Series,'' ABC Sports
executive vice president Brian McAndrews said. ``It was more
something that needed to be worked out to make the economics
work.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T was in the news this week with its $38 billion purchase of
TCI, the cable outfit. Writing another check for a million or two
for a corporate sponsorship was no big deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The TCI deal was a strictly business deal,'' AT&AMP;T spokesman
Burke Stinson said. ``The Rose Bowl deal is good for AT&AMP;T's image
and is a plus for us. We hope to bring class not crass to the Rose
Bowl proceedings. We're not looking to plaster the place with AT&AMP;T
logos, on the field or on the players' uniforms.''
</P>
<P>
   Uh huh. Sure.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Rose is retaining some of its haughtiness. ``We
have consistently said we would not accept a title sponsor, just a
presenting one,'' Cronk said.
</P>
<P>
   It might be the ``Tostitos'' Fiesta Bowl and the ``Nokia'' Sugar
Bowl and the ``Federal Express'' Orange Bowl, but a Rose is Rose is
a Rose Bowl ... presented by AT&AMP;T.

MAYOR ABANDONS PLAN TO BAN SIDEWALK VENDORS
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's administration on Thursday
moved further away from its plan for a widespread ban on sidewalk
vendors in Manhattan, announcing that it would work with the City
Council to instead regulate the number of people who sell food,
tube socks, comic books and paperbacks on busy streets.
</P>
<P>
   City officials insisted that they still wanted to end vending on
many sidewalks to reduce congestion, though they said they had not
decided how many. But it was clear from testimony before a City
Council committee Thursday that the mayor was seeking a compromise
in his aggressive campaign to combat clusters of food carts and
street artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a middle ground between having no vendors entirely on
a street as opposed to a limited number _ perhaps one, perhaps two
is something that is manageable,'' Joseph Rose, the city's planning
director, said after an appearance before the council's
Transportation Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Rose's comments marked the second time in just over a week that
the administration had scaled back what was once an ambitious plan
to ban vending on 144 blocks in Manhattan. And together, the moves
amounted to an unusual concession for the mayor, who has seemed to
revel in fighting what he considers quality-of-life offenders like
reckless cab drivers, turnstile jumpers, ``squeegee men'' and, most
recently, sidewalk vendors.
</P>
<P>
   But while the public has been largely supportive of much of
Giuliani's quality-of-life crusade, the planned vending crackdown
produced little enthusiasm. Thousands of customers signed petitions
opposing the bans and applauded when vendors shut their carts for a
day and marched down Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, lawyers for the city have voiced concerns about
fighting lawsuits by vendors and street artists. Rose said the
administration was now willing to replace or reshape the Street
Vendor Review Panel, a body dominated by mayoral appointees. The
panel's charter limits it to all-or-nothing decisions about whether
to close streets to vending.
</P>
<P>
   Rose told the committee that the administration now favored a
more flexible approach that could put caps on the number of vendors
in certain locations rather than a wholesale ban on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of its limited authority, the panel does not have the
ability today to reconcile street vending with congestion and other
streetscape concerns in the most successful manner,'' Rose
testified. ``Additional legislation is warranted to achieve a more
balanced result.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose testified in a respectful, conciliatory tone that
contrasted sharply with the brusque indignation that many of the
mayor's appointees have expressed in recent testimony before the
council, which has so bitterly fought the mayor over the city
budget and other matters that the two sides have barely been
talking in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   So council members were delighted, if stunned, to find the mayor
enlisting their help in regulating street peddlers, who have
bedeviled mayors for most of this century. ``New York City's
pushcart wars have now raged longer than the Cold War,'' said
Councilman Noach Dear, D-Brooklyn, the chairman of Thursday's
hearing. ``It appears an elusive cease-fire could be at hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the administration's sudden turn to diplomacy,
Colleen Roche, the mayor's spokeswoman, said, ``The administration
is always open to discussing rational and thoughtful proposals.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Vallone, the City Council speaker, called Rose's statement
``a major step in the right direction'' of defusing the controversy
over the mayor's efforts to ban sidewalk vendors on 144 Manhattan
blocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how well intended, the way you do things makes a big
difference in how the public is going to receive it,'' Vallone
said. ``They were trying to do this by coming down with fiats and
orders.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite City Hall's conciliatory posture, spokesmen for the
city's best-organized group of vendors, the Big Apple Food Vendors
Association, said they remained suspicious of the mayor. ``If you
tell me you're going to help me but you keep grinding me down and
keep putting the knife in my back, you're not helping me,'' said
Jeffrey Cicio, the group's president.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday night, Deputy Mayor Rudy Washington
seemed to indicate that the group had good reason to be concerned,
saying he hoped that about two-thirds of the 144 streets would be
off limits to vending.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have a congestion problem on certain streets in this
town and vendors cannot go anyplace they want to go,'' Washington
said. ``By the very nature of their business, they want to go where
the people are. That is inherently dangerous.''

NASH, NOWITZKI CONSIDER MAVS CONTRACTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Mavericks' whirlwind draft took a turn in the right
direction yesterday, as newly acquired point guard Steve Nash
indicated he is willing to sign a long-term contract.
</P>
<P>
   And as owner Ross Perot Jr., general manager Don Nelson and
assistant coach Donnie Nelson flew to Germany, the agent for
first-round pick Dirk Nowitzki also admitted there is at least a
possibility his client will play in America next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know these people and there are problems to work
out,'' agent Holger Geschwinder said by telephone from Wurzburg,
Germany. ``But we are honored and happy they are coming. Perhaps it
can finish with Dirk playing in Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Nelson engineered a three-team trade Wednesday night that
left his team without its 1999 first-round pick but with Nash,
Nowitzki and the immense pressure of both having to immediately
sign the German prospect and make the playoffs next season in order
to make the deal a success. The team passed on Kansas forward Paul
Pierce, who was available at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said he made the moves not only because of his affection
for his new players but also because an evaluation that next year's
draft _ expected to be headed by UCLA point guard Baron Davis and
Connecticut small forward Richard Hamilton _ will be generally
weak.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a gamble, yeah, we could fall on our face again and give
up what could be the first pick in the draft,'' Nelson said
yesterday morning before boarding a 2:30 p.m. flight for Germany to
open negotiations with Nowitzki. ``But it's a risk worth taking.''
</P>
<P>
   The chances of signing the 6-foot-11 Nowitzki improved when
Geschwinder, who on Tuesday warned NBA teams that they would be
``wasting'' their pick on Nowitzki, petitioned the German
Basketball Federation yesterday for a special exemption that will
allow Nowitzki to stay in Germany over the weekend to talk with the
Mavericks instead of joining his Under-22 national team for a
tournament in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll talk to them out of respect for the NBA,'' said
Geschwinder, credited with discovering the 20-year-old
``wunderkind''. ``Every boy who bounces a ball in the streets of
Germany dreams of making the NBA. Dirk is no different.''
</P>
<P>
   Told that Nowitzki, who concludes a one-year commitment to the
German army Tuesday, is being billed as the best German import
since the Volkswagen, Geschwinder deadpanned that ``Dirk is a
Porsche.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, however, several roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
   Geschwinder is concerned about the NBA's impending lockout on
July 1, and he said Nowitzki already has four contract offers of $1
million or more ]tax-free from Kinder Bologna, Bennetton Treviso
and Milan in Italy and Barcelona in Spain. He also said that the
team Nowitzki played on this season _ the DJK Wurzburg X-Rays of
the German League's weak second division _ is out of the running
for his services.
</P>
<P>
   Under the salary cap,the Mavericks will be able to offer
Nowitzki a three-year contract paying him approximately $1.3
million next season, but they will not be able to have contact with
him if the lockout is invoked Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Nelsons and Perot are scheduled to arrive in the Bavarian
town of Wurzburg and take Geschwinder, Nowitzki and his family to
dinner tonight. Nash, acquired for Bubba Wells, Martin Muursepp and
the '99 pick, declined an invitation to join the party because of
family obligations in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed I can't make it,'' he said from England.
``Maybe I'll send a singing telegram.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Nelson, ``I don't have a clue what's going to happen. I'll
just probably sleep on his porch until I convince him to come back
with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Geschwinder said the biggest hurdle will be Nowitzki's
commitment to the German federation] and his desire to play for his
country in the 2000 Olympics in Australia. Pointing out that
European teams are agreeing to make allowances for Nowitzki to play
in February-March qualifications in '99, he said a similar deal
would have to be part of an agreement with the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   Said Geschwinder: ``Money will be a factor but not the first
thing on the list. He wants to be able to play and develop his
game, not sit the bench. Dirk's family runs a profitable wallpaper
business. This isn't all about big money.''
</P>
<P>
   Nash, meanwhile, said the Mavericks have already spoken with his
agent, Bill Duffy, about signing a long-term contract extension
before next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very agreeable to that because I'm excited about this
team,'' said Nash, entering the final year of a three-year deal
scheduled to pay him $1.05 million next season. ``I'm ready to get
consistent minutes. I'm not going to out-athlete you or jump over
you, but I'm going to dive on the floor and beat you with my
balance of skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, who tried to acquire Nash before last February's trading
deadline, said yesterday he considers Nash a better prospect that
Arizona's Mike Bibby, the second player taken in Wednesday's draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think \rNash\scan play 35 minutes and get you 20 points and
10 assists a night,'' Nelson said. ``He's that good.'' /

Stunning goal 
by Hernandez 
advances cause
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN P. LOPEZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SAINT-ETIENNE, France _ They called it a miracle, and they said
it happened because they felt the pride and the heart of the
Mexican people lift them.
</P>
<P>
   They prayed, too.
</P>
<P>
   They stopped the team bus on the way to Stade Geoffroy-Guichard
and visited a cathedral where a statue of the Virgin de Guadelupe
stood. They kissed the statue's feet and crossed themselves. They
lit candles. They went to the stadium and pulled on their jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   And then, they went out and played the most entertaining,
unlikely and dramatic game the 1998 World Cup has seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were close to dead,'' Mexico goalkeeper Jorge Campos said,
``but we came back.''
</P>
<P>
   The show put on by the tri-color Thursday afternoon wasn't only
about coming back from two goals down in the final moments to tie
the Netherlands 2-2. Mexico had come from behind twice in this
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   It was prayers answered in spectacular fashion.
</P>
<P>
   It was knowing that all hopes of staying alive in the World Cup
were slipping away. It was playing 10 men on 11 after a
questionable call led to Mexico's Ramon Ramirez arguing vehemently
and getting ejected.
</P>
<P>
   It was facing the mighty orange machine of the Netherlands, a
team many expect to lift the trophy at the end of this tournament.
</P>
<P>
   It was Luis Hernandez, the Mexican heartthrob with the flowing
blond hair, sprinting upfield, poking in the equalizing goal just
15 seconds before the final whistle and then falling to his knees
and crying at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you saw was the pride of the Mexican,'' said Hernandez,
whose goal came in the 95th minute and surely will be remembered by
Mexican fans for years to come. ``We are all like that. We don't
want to die without fighting to the last man. We don't want to give
up. Mexicans fight to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   It couldn't have gotten any closer to the end at rollicking
Stade Geoffroy-Guichard.
</P>
<P>
   As Mexico trailed throughout, Belgium, the other contender for
the Group E berth behind the Dutch, was defeating South Korea in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to hope that the Koreans would tie the game
over there and help us,'' Mexican coach Manuel Lapuente said. ``We
knew we had to do it ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   And they did, in memorable fashion, clinching the berth and
moving on to face another World Cup favorite, Germany, in
Montpellier on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got out of a tricky situation,'' Mexican captain Alberto
Garcia Aspe said. ``Most of us didn't know what was going on in the
other game. We showed the kind of team we can be. Right now we feel
like we can take on anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The South Koreans did come back to tie Belgium in the other
Group E game, which meant Mexico would have advanced anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mexican way is you go out and win or lose; live or die,''
Hernandez said. ``You give everything for the win.''
</P>
<P>
   On a day when the tri-color started slowly, as the Dutch whipped
through the Mexican defense for a pair of goals and three more
opportunities in the first 19 minutes, Mexico finally gathered
itself and counterattacked strongly in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Pelaez, a journeyman player rarely used on the national
team until recently, finally broke stout Dutch goalkeeper Edwin van
der Sar with a well-placed header off a corner kick only 15 minutes
before the end of regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an unforgettable moment now that I can remember my
whole life,'' Pelaez said.
</P>
<P>
   Campos then turned back a pair of Dutch chances with spectacular
saves, as Mexico pushed everyone forward trying desperately for the
game-tying goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was over, we thought we won,'' said Dutch
striker Phillip Cocu, who scored his team's first goal. ``It's
never over before the final whistle, but we had them down and we
were playing our game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fought our hardest. We fought and fought to keep them away,
but Mexico was a champion today.''
</P>
<P>
   And it was Hernandez, whose sprained ankle had him listed as
doubtful before kickoff, who blasted through the middle of the
Dutch penalty box in the 95th minute, as referee Abdul Al Zeid was
looking at his watch, counting down the seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Pelaez headed a pass perfectly in front of Hernandez, who beat
Jaap Stam and nudged the ball past van der Sar.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium erupted with bedlam from the Mexican fans and groans
of agony from the Dutch.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know about the Mexican people, you know we do not do
anything without our hearts nearly breaking first,'' said
Hernandez, who was limping after the game and says he again is not
sure if he will be able to play against Germany. ``There is nothing
like this flavor in our mouths right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to lose. This is the ultimate triumph. We have
to dedicate this game to the people of Mexico. We felt their
support. They believed in us. We fought for Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it all seemed so divine for this once-embattled team
playing wide-open, dynamic soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the type of team that will attack with confidence
against anybody,'' striker Cuauhtemoc Blanco said. ``We're showing
a lot of character in this tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the second consecutive game in which Mexico trailed 2-0
against a favored team, only to come back for the tie. Had Belgium
been able to hang on against Mexico this week, it would have
advanced instead.
</P>
<P>
   And in the game Mexico won over South Korea, Mexico also was
losing in the second half 1-0,but came back.
</P>
<P>
   This time the odds seemed especially long, considering how
strong the Netherlands looked in a 5-0 win over South Korea on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very good show, but they outplayed us in the second
half,'' van der Sar said. ``We didn't win, we didn't lose, but it's
not enough to just get to the second round. We want to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, it felt like Mexico won that game today.''
</P>
<P>
   As Mexican fans went wild after the whistle, it felt like a
Mexican victory, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``El corazon! El corazon!,'' Blanco screamed, pounding his fist
into his chest, with Mexico's fans breaking into cheers and chants.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez made his way to the edge of the grandstands and led
thousands of Mexicans in one of their trademark cheers _ ``Mexico,
Mexico, rah-rah-rah.''
</P>
<P>
   Players draped Mexican flags over their shoulders and donned
sombreros. And choruses of Cielito Lindo, the unofficial Mexican
soccer anthem, rang through the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a lot to do,'' Hernandez said. ``If we can
outplay the Dutch like we did today, we can outplay anyone.''

Shutout loss to Yugoslavia compounds problems for Americans
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN P. LOPEZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SAINT-ETIENNE, France _ It was less than a minute into the game
Thursday when U.S. midfielder Frankie Hejduk's header bounced off
the Yugoslavian goal post.
</P>
<P>
   It was less than five minutes before the end of the game when
U.S. striker Preki Radosavljevic perfectly struck a free kick from
20 yards out, curving it over the wall of Yugoslavian defenders and
directly at the goal.
</P>
<P>
   It sailed inches high.
</P>
<P>
   And there you had the appropriate bookend images on the final 90
minutes of the 1998 U.S. World Cup experience.
</P>
<P>
   Clang. Whiff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were never able to capitalize in front of the net,''
embattled U.S. coach Steve Sampson said after the game. ``Everyone
gave it their best tonight, but we have to improve.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing could have epitomized the disappointing U.S. effort at
the World Cup better than its final game, a 1-0 loss to Yugoslavia
in which all the American problems came to light.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans played well in spurts, particularly in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   They had impressive moments, as good as any team in the world
could have had. It put a scare into a quality European opponent. It
had opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   But in front of the goal and on the scoreboard, the Americans
came up empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started off well, but unfortunately we conceded the early
goal,'' Sampson said. ``I thought we improved with every match we
played but we need to do better in front of goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We created some opportunities, but we couldn't take them.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia made the most of its chances, just as Iran did
against the United States on Sunday in a 2-1 win and Germany did
before that in a 2-0 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslavians scored all they needed at Stade de la Beaujoire
in Nantes in the fourth minute.
</P>
<P>
   Defender Slobodan Komljenovic reacted perfectly after U.S.
goalkeeper Brad Friedel deflected a 35-yard free kick by Sinisa
Mihajlovic.
</P>
<P>
   Komljenovic headed in the rebound, and from there the
Yugoslavians merely had to step up the defense and hold on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were worried about playing the Americans,'' Yugoslavia
coach Slobodan Santrac said. ``We expected them to come out and
attack and they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made the most of our goal, but the Americans played well
and I think they are a team that will continue to progress in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there were only a few legitimate U.S. chances to tie the
game, but, like so many other times in this tournament, the
opportunities were not converted.
</P>
<P>
   The United States ends the 1998 Cup with just one goal in three
games.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslavians move on to the quarterfinals, finishing second
in Group F behind Germany, which Thursday night defeated Iran 2-0
in Montpellier, where Germany can remain until Monday when it faces
Mexico in the round of 16.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia will face the Netherlands also Monday in Toulouse.
</P>
<P>
   Sampson, who was harshly criticized by some of his players for
what they said was a lack of direction going into the World Cup,
made significant changes in the lineup for Thursday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Four players started for the first time in the game. But most
notably, Sampson kept veteran U.S. defender Alexi Lalas, who was
among Sampson's most vocal critics, on the bench throughout the
tournament, as he substituted in other veterans such as Marcelo
Balboa, Eric Wynalda and Preki.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the snub of Lalas and again not starting Balboa,
Wynalda and Preki, Sampson said: ``We played well against Iran
without them and even better tonight, so I don't think that they
would have added much more to the team.''

PARTY SWITCH POINTS TO SHIFT AMONG HISPANIC VOTERS
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The political conversion of Herman Badillo, the
former U.S. representative, deputy mayor and mayoral candidate,
from Democrat to Republican was greeted Thursday largely with
dispassionate shrugs from the city's Hispanic politicians, most of
them Democrats, who portrayed Badillo as a political relic who was
out of step with the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   But despite such nonchalance, several of the city's Hispanic
politicians, all of them Democrats, said that Badillo's party
switch should serve as a call to Democratic Party officials to take
the city's Hispanic voters more seriously and to ensure that
Hispanic leaders play a more central role in the political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Badillo, a fixture in the city's political landscape for
decades, made official Thursday what many politicians already
considered a reality.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials said they believed that Badillo's
announcement would have little meaning in terms of the Republican
Party's influence among Hispanic New Yorkers. But in recent years,
Republicans have made slight inroads among the 2.2 million Hispanic
New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll of 1,000 Hispanic New Yorkers conducted by the
Hispanic Federation indicated that the percentage of Hispanic
registered Republicans has increased to 12 percent, from 10 percent
a year ago. An even larger increase was recorded among Dominican
New Yorkers, who account for about a quarter of the city's Hispanic
residents and are the fastest-growing immigrant group in New York
City. About 16 percent of Dominican New Yorkers are registered
Republicans, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
   Some politicians suggested that the increased Republican
registration was the result of five years of New York City's being
led by a Republican mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, whose popularity among
Hispanic New Yorkers has climbed.
</P>
<P>
   Others said that many of the new Hispanic immigrants, especially
those from South and Central America, tend to be more conservative
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Miranda, a consultant and former president of the Hispanic
Federation, said there is a growing tendency among these Hispanic
New Yorkers to register as Republicans or as independent voters.
</P>
<P>
   While a subtle shift toward the Republican Party may be
occurring among some Hispanic voters, with the exception of Badillo
it is not reflected among the city's leading Hispanic politicians.
</P>
<P>
   The most influential of the current crop of Hispanic politicians
are all Democrats, and they include Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx
borough president; U.S. Rep. Nydia Velazquez; Rep. Jose Serrano,
and members of the City Council and the state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Badillo's formal announcement, made at a press conference with
Giuliani and William Powers, the state Republican chairman, at his
side, caused some reflection among many of the erstwhile colleagues
of a man who was once the city's most prominent Hispanic
politician.
</P>
<P>
   ``In practical terms, it means very little except that the
Republican Party will be able to showcase Herman as a Puerto Rican
who found religion in their party,'' said Assemblyman Roberto
Ramirez, the Democratic Party chairman in the Bronx, Badillo's home
borough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that Mr. Badillo has been espousing Republican
ideology for quite a few years now,'' Ramirez continued. ``If we
were talking about Herman Badillo in the 1960s or the 1970s, when
he pushed issues that had meaning in the community, this would be a
big event. But the fact of the matter is, most of us wondered what
took him so long.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ramirez added that Badillo's announcement was nonetheless
``a real sounding alarm'' that the Democratic Party ``will have to
continue to reach out, to work with and to place actual value on
the Latino constituency.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ferrer, who is one of Badillo's successors as the Bronx borough
president and the highest-ranking Hispanic city official, said that
Badillo ``seems to have lost his way.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``All I can say is that I am really profoundly sad
that he's now seen fit to embrace a party that has been anti-city,
anti-immigrant and anti-opportunity. I don't profess to understand
it, but I'm just sad. I remember who Herman used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Badillo offered a strong attack on his former
political party.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a lifelong Democrat, I did not make this decision
lightly,'' he said. ``This is an extremely difficult step for me to
take, but in the end I had no choice. Over the years, I found
myself disagreeing more and more with city and state Democratic
policies and positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Badillo made his remarks after a speech at the Women's National
Republican Club in midtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, Democratic leaders have advocated the same old
conditions with no accountability,'' he said. ``Hard experience has
convinced me that Democratic leaders are never going to change.
It's sad to say, but as times have changed, the New York State
Democratic Party has largely remained in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   While Democrats generally responded with derision, Badillo's
announcement was hailed by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of Herman as a pioneer in so many ways,'' Giuliani
said. ``This is one of the most courageous decisions, and once
again Herman Badillo is showing people a way they can improve their
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Miranda said, ``Herman Badillo will forever be a pioneer Puerto
Rican who opened doors for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   While he conceded that ``Latinos are, for the most part,
Democrats,'' he said there was the chance for Republicans to make
great inroads among Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment the Republican Party begins to embrace such issues
as immigration, expenditures in education and issues of concern to
Latinos, they will support the Republican Party,'' Miranda said.

COMMENTARY: RECALLING PAIN IN A COUNTRY USED TO IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some out-of-towners come here not for shop-and-gawk
excursions but rather for lessons in life. They want to find out
why crime is down, or how well the subways run, or what to do about
the homeless. A few months ago, officials from post-communist
Mongolia went to Wall Street to pick up pointers on using
capitalist tools.
</P>
<P>
   Few, very few, come for ideas on how to remember perhaps the
most monstrous epoch of a century that has been filled with horror.
So it was interesting to tag along this week with a group of
Russians touring New York's most important memorial to the Nazi
Holocaust, the Museum of Jewish Heritage, which opened last year in
Battery Park City.
</P>
<P>
   These visitors, most of them officials of the Russian Jewish
Congress, hardly needed instruction in the Holocaust. Hundreds of
thousands of Jews from the former Soviet Union were among the 6
million European Jews who perished. And Jewish or not, Russians
don't need Americans to teach them about pain.
</P>
<P>
   But they could use help, this group said, in figuring out what
should be included in a Holocaust museum they plan to build in a
popular Moscow park that itself stands as a memorial to Russian
suffering in World War II. The very idea of such a museum in
Moscow, as implausible in Soviet days as walking on the clouds, is
still new and strange.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get to the reality of it, you realize it's almost a
mission impossible,'' said Michael Steiner, director of the Moscow
office of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, a New
York-based relief agency that sponsored the Russian group.
</P>
<P>
   It was not surprising, then, that questions outnumbered answers
this week. Even so, the visitors, who also went to Holocaust
museums in Los Angeles, Washington and Houston, left for home with
a basic sense of what they would like their own to be. ``We want it
to be expressive and impressive to non-Jews as well as Jews,'' said
Alexander Osovtsov, vice president of the Russian Jewish Congress.
</P>
<P>
   New York was their final stop. Each of the museums on their
itinerary had its merits, they said. But Pinchas Goldschmidt, the
chief rabbi of Moscow, was particularly struck by the one in lower
Manhattan, because it does not dwell on mass murder alone. It also
shows the vibrancy of Jewish life both before and after the war _ a
cautionary tale for those Jews who draw their identity principally
from the Nazis' attempts at extermination and not from their own
rich heritage.
</P>
<P>
   That lesson was not lost on the Russian visitors, most of whom
spoke English well. ``There is past, present and future,''
Goldschmidt said. ``It's not only about death and destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   It took decades of false starts and reversals for the New York
museum to become a reality. If anything, the complications may be
even greater for the Russian Jews. ``The soil for a museum is
different than in America,'' said one of them, Tankred Golenpolski.
</P>
<P>
   That's for sure. American civilians may have put up with
hardships during World War II, but nothing like the devastation
that the Soviet Union endured. More than 20 million people there
died, and for years the official line was that they were not Jews
or Belarussians or Ukrainians or Gypsies but Soviet citizens,
period.
</P>
<P>
   So any attempt to show the suffering of just the Jews requires a
balancing act worthy of the Moscow circus, Golenpolski said. You
have to present them not merely as victims but also as soldiers in
the Soviet army. You have to portray the centuries of Jewish life
in Russia, not just the pogroms.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be able,'' Golenpolski said, ``to talk to the
Russian who will say: `I lost my father just like you lost yours.
OK, he didn't die in a gas chamber. But I still lost him.' That is
a just point. But you also have to give Jews their due. We were the
only ones destroyed because we were Jews, not because of political
inclinations. You have to figure out how to drive that point
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the rabbi, he was impressed by the New York museum, with
its biblical admonitions at the entrance: ``Remember, never
forget,'' from Deuteronomy, and ``There is hope for your future,''
from Jeremiah. Still, the Russians walked away realizing they had
far to go. But that is nothing to fear, they were told by David
Altshuler, the director of the museum here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news,'' he said, ``is that the work is forever.''

TURNING UP SOME HIGH HEAT ON THE OLD BRAWL GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ American League president Gene Budig has had
a busy summer building his new reputation as Lord High Executioner.
</P>
<P>
   Budig suspended Seattle Mariners pitcher Randy Johnson in April
for three games after two consecutive pitches from Johnson sailed
near the head of Cleveland Indians outfielder Kenny Lofton. Last
month, Baltimore Orioles reliever Armando Benitez was suspended for
eight games for hitting New York Yankees first baseman Tino
Martinez, a move that started a fight and even angered his own
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim Angels manager Terry Collins and Kansas City Royals
manager Tony Muser were each suspended for eight games this month
after their teams engaged in a beanball war and bench-clearing
rumble. Nine players were also suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Budig called the brawls ``an embarrassment to Major League
Baseball'' and refused to reduce the penalties upon appeal. Nor did
he relent when Yankees reliever Mike Stanton appealed a five-game
suspension for hitting Orioles outfielder Eric Davis with a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody agrees that player safety is our first concern, and
we're all committed to seeing that,'' Budig said.
</P>
<P>
   But if Budig is on a mission to do something about beanballs and
bench-clearing brawls, he's likely to run into resistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the way the game has been played for 100 years,''
Texas Rangers reliever John Wetteland said. ``I don't like to see
people getting hit. I think it's sick. And it hurts. You win games
by getting people out. But sometimes people take liberties and they
need to be told those liberties won't be tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it baseball's version of frontier justice or, if Moses had
been a baseball fan, a fastball inside for a fastball inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's important on every team,'' Rangers pitcher John Burkett
said. ``If a hitter thinks he's being thrown at on purpose, he has
no way to retaliate. He can go out after a pitcher, but then he'll
be thrown out and suspended for four or five games. The easiest way
to get back is to plug one of their hitters. They usually
understand, they take their medicine, and it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball players have always been slow at turning the other
cheek, and it doesn't always start with a hit by pitch.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the Rangers were angered when Orioles first baseman
Glenn Davis slid in high at home plate and severely spiked catcher
Ivan Rodriguez. The next day, the Rangers called on reliever Danny
Leon to retaliate, but he got his players mixed up and hit Cal
Ripken instead.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the Indians were furious with Rodriguez when he
slid hard into shortstop Omar Vizquel at second base, putting
Vizquel out for seven weeks with a torn ligament in his knee. The
next time the two teams met, Rodriguez got nailed in the left
shoulder by pitcher Jack Morris.
</P>
<P>
   Those seemed to be obvious situations for retaliation.
Retaliation seemed evident when Benitez threw at Martinez
immediately after giving up a three-run home run to Bernie
Williams. Benitez denied the accusation, but nobody in baseball
believed him.
</P>
<P>
   Throwing a knockdown pitch after a home run is ``wrong,'' Boston
Red Sox first baseman Mo Vaughn said. ``I still maintain if you
can't get guys out across the plate, get another job. You can
really hurt somebody. Tino Martinez didn't hit that home run.
Someone else did. You can really hurt someone pitching like that.
It can't be tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Yankees pitcher David Wells: ``I think that was ridiculous
and uncalled for. It's not good for baseball. It's part of the
game, yes. But to be blatant like that is not acceptable. I've had
teammates upset with me for doing that once. I regret doing that
because you can really hurt somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, it's often difficult to distinguish when a
pitcher is deliberately throwing at a hitter and when one really
did ``get away'' from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who understand the game know when somebody is throwing
at somebody and when they're not,'' Rangers pitcher Aaron Sele
said. ``Ninety-nine percent of the time, it's by accident. There's
a difference between throwing inside and throwing at hitters. As
big and strong as some of these hitters are, you have to get on the
small part of the bat and the best way is to pitch inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Rangers outfielder Rusty Greer: ``Pitching inside is part
of the game. When you're in the batter's box, you run the risk of
getting hit. At the same time, if the guy in front of you hits a
home run and the next ball goes behind your head, it might be a
little obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer said that when it comes to retaliation, ``Every case is
different. It's up to the pitcher to decide. I'm not going up to
the pitcher and say, `You need to protect me.' It's up to the
pitcher to decide if he wants to or not.''

PENTAGON ADVISER CRITICIZES TECHNOLOGY EXPORT CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to correct byline)  (af)  
 By ERIC SCHMITT  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A senior Pentagon adviser Thursday accused the
Clinton administration of diminishing the Pentagon's role in
safeguarding sensitive American technology exports in favor of
commercial interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``What passes for an export control system has been hijacked by
longtime ideological opponents of the very concept of export
controls,'' said Peter Leitner, a senior trade adviser to the
agency for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   While a senior Pentagon official denied Leitner's charges made
at a Senate hearing Thursday, he acknowledged the government could
improve the way it handles exports of technology that have both
commercial and military applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a balance, and we have to continue to make that
balance,'' Franklin Miller, a principal deputy assistant secretary
of defense told a hearing of the Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's hearing, a spinoff of the multipronged congressional
inquiry into whether China obtained sensitive technology that
helped its ballistic missiles, focused on an important, but little
known Pentagon bureaucracy, the Defense Technology Security
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is responsible for preventing the unauthorized
transfer of sensitive technical information and technology, such as
communication satellites and supercomputers, to other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Leitner, the hearing's main witness, accused the administration
of ``neutering'' the Pentagon agency's role by hiring inexperienced
and poorly trained staff, rubber-stamping export licenses on scant
technical information and stifling dissent from career officials
like himself.
</P>
<P>
   But Miller took issue with virtually every one of Leitner's
criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   Leitner, for example, had offered charts that indicated a sharp
decline after 1995 in the percentage of cases of ``dual-use''
technology export cases that the agency had referred to the Defense
Intelligence Agency and the armed services for review of sensitive
technology.
</P>
<P>
   But Miller said the decline coincided with a new policy that
required the Commerce Department to refer all dual-use applications
to the Pentagon agency for review, not just those that Commerce
deemed necessary. So the volume of cases rose.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, Miller said the charge that the agency had
been marginalized was ''nonsense,'' and then described fierce,
internal administration debates over loosening exports controls on
technology like satellites, as examples of full Pentagon
participation.
</P>
<P>
   But that defense did not persuade the committee chairman, Sen.
Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., who said, ``Commercial interests have had a
bigger play than they should have.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Also on Capitol Hill, other congressional committees debated the
merits of the administration's China policies.
</P>
<P>
   In a lift for President Clinton, the House Ways and Means
Committee approved by voice vote Clinton's decision to renew
China's trade status and urged lawmakers to reject calls to sever
normal trading relations with Beijing. The measure now goes to the
full House.
</P>
<P>
   In another House hearing, two major rocket motor makers
testified that a policy started by President Ronald Reagan to allow
American satellite companies to launch their satellites in foreign
countries was hurting the American launching industry as well as
helping foreign militaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``A loss of satellite launching business to foreign competitors
diminishes companies that support the U.S. strategic deterrent,
while at the same time subsidizing the development of a foreign
capability,'' Paul Ross, a group vice president of Alliant
Techsystems, a rocket-motor maker in Hopkins, Minn., told the House
Science Committee.
</P>
<P>
   At the same hearing, a former McDonnell Douglas aerospace
engineer, Leon McKinney, confirmed what many scientists had been
saying on Capitol Hill for weeks: ``If you improve launch-vehicle
guidance technology.'' The launch-vehicle technology guides rockets
carrying satellites.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying fear in any unauthorized technology transfer to
the Chinese is that it helped improve the reliability of Beijing's
nuclear missiles. The Clinton administration insists this has not
been the result of any licensed technology exports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could American companies simply by asking questions in the
right way upgrade Chinese capability?'' asked Rep. Dana
Rohrabacher, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most probably,'' said McKinney, who is now an independent
aerospace consultant in Missouri.

 &HT;    TIANANMEN SQUARE POLISHES FOR CLINTON ARRIVAL
 &HT;    With CHINA-LEADERS-$ADV26; , CHINA-HISTBOX-$ADV26.
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Mao Tse-Tung's ghostly portrait beamed down on
Tiananmen Square as China prepared an ear-splitting 21-gun salute
Saturday for the American president Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's earliest hours after arrival in China were dogged by
the issue drawing greatest interest in America -- human rights --
with reports that several dissidents had been detained before Air
Force One landed Thursday night in the ancient imperial capital of
Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find the reports disturbing. If true, they represent not
China at its best, not China looking forward, but looking
backward,'' Clinton said Friday morning, when asked about the
reported arrests as he toured a village outside Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons I came here is to discuss both privately
and publicly issues of personal freedom,'' Clinton said. ``It makes
it all the more important that we continue to work with the Chinese
and to engage them.''
</P>
<P>
   The talks with villagers Friday at the town of Xiahe and the
spectacular welcome Thursday with robed dancers and heart-thudding
drumbeats, were only a prelude to the events Saturday at Beijing's
infamous downtown square. That will be the centerpiece of his
nine-day visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If China will cooperate with America, then nobody can defeat
China,'' said Wei Wenqing, 86, on the day President Clinton became
the first U.S. leader in a decade to land on Chinese soil. The
gnarled pensioner was out for an afternoon walk on the exact spot
where Clinton is due to receive the ceremonial Tiananmen Square
greeting that the U.S. House of Representatives urged the president
to refuse.
</P>
<P>
   Workers could be seen polishing the brass doors of the Great
Hall of the People. This massive parliament building, which
resembles an over-grown Soviet-built subway station, will be the
television backdrop as Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin
stride down a formation of People's Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers
on the western edge of the world's biggest public square.
</P>
<P>
   If China's past practice is followed, the troops Clinton reviews
will be carrying highly polished fixed bayonets.
</P>
<P>
   Following the 15-minute outdoor ceremony, Clinton and the
71-year-old Jiang are due to mount a set of stone steps leading
into the Great Hall of the People for the first session of their
Beijing summit conference.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-gun salute Clinton will receive is an honor that China
reserves for a rarefied group of foreign leaders it regards as
especially worth cultivating. In this decade they have included
Japanese Emperor Akihito in 1992, King Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia
in 1994, Russian President Boris Yeltsin in 1997 and Bulgarian
President Petur Stoyanov last month.
</P>
<P>
   Except for hauling in some extra flower pots, the Chinese seemed
to be making no effort to prettify the square that to many in
America symbolizes the Chinese Communist Party's cold-blooded
suppression of the 1989 student-led pro-democracy movement.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, along one of the main streets bordering the square there
hangs a big blue propaganda billboard saying in English and
Chinese, ``Devote Our Great Efforts To Build Up The Socialist
Spiritual Foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Clinton will make any gesture in memory of the victims
of the Tiananmen crackdown is one of many question marks hovering
over this summit.
</P>
<P>
   The official welcome Saturday will be a stiff and formal affair
compared to the glorious extravaganza the Chinese staged on
Thursday night, little more than an hour after President and Mrs.
Clinton and their daughter Chelsea flew into the 600-year-old
former imperial capital of Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
   China's state television broke into its main evening news show
at 7:15 p.m. (China time) to announce that Air Force One had
landed. Until that interruption the news anchor hadn't mentioned
the Clinton visit, and the 10 p.m. news didn't give it very good
billing -- it was the fifth item reported, after news about such
momentous events as Prime Minister Zhu Rongji's visit to a drug
exhibit and a performance by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   At the colorful Xi'an show in front of the city's towering old
South Gate, which featured huge red lanterns, lithe dancers in
gauzy dresses and performers marching in through billows of smoke,
Clinton made oblique reference to some of the political
controversies studding his trip before it even began.
</P>
<P>
   ``Respect for the worth, the dignity, the potential and the
freedom of every citizen is a vital source of America's strength
and success,'' he told the select crowd of about 1,000 invited
onlookers, raising thoughts of the human rights issues so sensitive
here.
</P>
<P>
   And he added that providing all people opportunities to develop
``is vital to the strength and success of the new China, as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports that authorities arrested several dissidents in the days
leading up to Clinton's arrival added to the strain attending this
visit.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said he anticipates U.S.
Ambassador James Sasser ``will bring this up directly with the
Chinese government'' on Friday. He also said Clinton will encourage
China to permit free political dialogue when he holds formal talks
with Chinese President Jiang on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Before heading on to the controversial Tiananmen Square welcome,
Clinton spent the day in Xi'an Friday, first touring the resting
place of more than 7,000 ancient terra cotta warriors, horses and
chariots, the 2,000-year-old wonder unearthed little more than 20
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   At a roundtable discussion at the nearby village of Xiahe,
Clinton glimpsed one of the more prosperous sectors of China's
countryside. The collection of houses, many built or renovated in
recent years, displayed the relative wealth accrued by virtue of
tourist dollars flowing into the area because of the terra cotta
warriors.
</P>
<P>
   All the villagers who spoke with Clinton expressed satisfaction
with the policies of the government and the way their lives are
going.
</P>
<P>
   One woman spoke of the problems of the elderly. And when Clinton
asked a doctor about the most serious health concern today he heard
that environmental problems are affecting people's health.

TRIAL EVIDENCE SUGGESTS HOW POLICE SHIELD THEIR OWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI and BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three and a half years after a Bronx man's errant
toss of a football led to his death while he was being taken into
custody by Officer Francis Livoti, the federal case against Livoti
has provided new evidence suggesting an ingrained reluctance in the
Police Department to punish either abusive officers or those who
cover up for them.
</P>
<P>
   Since Anthony Baez, 29, died of asphyxiation on Dec. 22, 1994,
Police Department critics have viewed the Livoti case as an example
of the department's lax control of officers with abusive
tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   But a deeper picture has emerged from the federal civil rights
trial now under way in U.S. District Court in Manhattan and from a
lawsuit filed by Baez's family against the city.
</P>
<P>
   It shows that some in the department were concerned about
Livoti's long history of excessive-force complaints as early as
1991, but that he was allowed to remain on patrol in part because
he was a delegate for the powerful Patrolmen's Benevolent
Association and because he was protected by connections high up in
the chain of command.
</P>
<P>
   During the federal trial, the U.S. attorney's office has
presented testimony that officers were not asked for statements in
the immediate aftermath of Baez's death but were allowed to gather
and discuss their version of events in parking lots, the district
attorney's office and the police union office.
</P>
<P>
   The government said it also had evidence that officers even
concocted a cover story to protect Livoti, one in which they blamed
a fictitious black man for choking Baez to death before running
off.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not jurors, who began deliberations Thursday, convict
Livoti, the disclosures about the department mirror those in other
abuse cases, most notably the one involving Abner Louima, in which
officers are accused of covering up the wrongdoing of colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Livoti case is a huge black eye for the Police Department
and the city,'' said Hector Soto, executive director of the
Civilian Compliant Review Board between 1994 and 1996. ``They left
him on the street. They let the other officers cover up for him,
then they did as little as possible to punish the people
responsible. This case is going to haunt the city for a long
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Livoti, who was eventually dismissed from the department in 1997
after police officials ruled that he used an illegal choke hold on
Baez, was acquitted of charges of criminally negligent homicide in
1996 by a Bronx judge, who called his fellow officers' testimony a
``nest of perjury.'' Yet none of those officers accused of lying
under oath have faced departmental sanctions or criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   And Louis Anemone, the police commander who police officials say
discounted Livoti's history of brutality complaints and prevented
other supervisors from transferring him to desk duty, has since
been promoted to chief of department, the third highest-ranking
police official in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Anemone has refused to comment on the case. Police Commissioner
Howard Safir also declined to comment on the case while the jury is
deliberating but has indicated in the past that he may investigate
the perjury allegations against Livoti's colleagues after the
federal trial has ended.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Police officials noted that after Baez's death, they began a
program to monitor officers with multiple brutality complaints.
</P>
<P>
   But Soto said that as far as the perjury allegations, there was
no need for the Police Department to delay an administrative
investigation. Other present and former law enforcement officials
questioned the department's commitment to policing its own
aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Fishbein, who was chief of the criminal division of the
U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan until 1997, refused to comment
on the Livoti case but said that in past prosecutions of police
officers, department officials often showed ``an institutional
reluctance'' to investigate their officers even when presented with
strong evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some cases, you felt like every step of the way you were
basically fighting the entire Police Department,'' Fishbein said.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony in Livoti's federal trial and depositions in the civil
suit have given an unusually candid look at the power that the
police union is allowed to wield in police brutality
investigations. Livoti's role as a PBA delegate, for example, acted
as a kind of shield when a supervisor sought to transfer him in
1991 because of complaints of brutality.
</P>
<P>
   William Casey, commander of the 46th Precinct, was concerned
that Livoti had accumulated nine complaints of excessive force in
his nine years on the police force and wrote a recommendation that
the officer be moved to desk duty or a less volatile precinct,
according to a deposition in the civil case.
</P>
<P>
   Casey, now a deputy chief, admitted in a deposition that there
were ``different criteria'' used to transfer union representatives,
whose conduct had to be ``more egregious than normal police
officers'' before they could be disciplined.
</P>
<P>
   But in an unusual move, the recommendation was blocked by
Casey's supervisor, Anemone, then a senior commander in the Bronx.
According to two senior police officials, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity, one of Anemone's main concerns was Livoti's
status as a union delegate.
</P>
<P>
   In the hours and days after the fatal confrontation in 1994,
testimony in the trial indicated, Livoti was again protected by the
PBA. The department's rules, which had been negotiated by the
union, allow a 48-hour waiting period before investigators can
question any officer involved in an on-duty shooting or an incident
in which a suspect dies in custody.
</P>
<P>
   Livoti's colleagues used that 48-hour delay as a window of
opportunity, prosecutors said, meeting on several occasions in
parking lots and the union's offices to coordinate their accounts
and fabricate a cover story.
</P>
<P>
   Justice John Walsh of state Supreme Court in Manhattan, who
worked as the Police Department's top prosecutor in the 1970s, said
that if the PBA's influence bordered on obstruction, it would be a
perversion of the union's role in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``A delegate's job is to see that the officer's rights are not
being violated, not to become involved in the facts of the case,''
Walsh said. ``When they overstep those boundaries, we end up with,
at the very least, the appearance of impropriety. This is an
example that the 48-hour rule doesn't work.''

MILLIONAIRE ACCUSED OF FLEECING HEALTH CARE PLAN FOR POOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM HERMANN AND SUSIE STECKNER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scottsdale millionaire Michael Phillips recently got an
operation. Trouble is, authorities say, he claimed to be destitute
and conned the state into helping pay for his surgery.
</P>
<P>
   And he's far from alone, say officials of the Arizona Health
Care Cost Containment System.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word on the street was, and may still be, that anyone can
get AHCCCS,'' said Sharon Miller, who oversees the agency's member
fraud unit.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, who was indicted Thursday, might be only one of
hundreds of clients who've conned the state's medical insurance
program for the poor out of hundreds of thousands of dollars in
just the past year.
</P>
<P>
   From 10 to 15 percent of people receiving public assistance get
their benefits fraudulently, national estimates say. For the $1.8
billion AHCCCS program, that could translate into about $250
million.
</P>
<P>
   Injured last year when a car hit his bicycle, Phillips racked up
$37,000 in medical bills. The state paid out just $3,533; the
remainder was covered by the driver's insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   AHCCCS verified one claim made by Phillips, but the others went
unchecked.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that particular case, I think they took the person's word
for it,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, 50, was arrested Thursday at his Scottsdale home. He
has been indicted on one count each of fraud schemes and theft.
</P>
<P>
   According to investigators, Phillips has an investment portfolio
valued at more than $850,000 and more than $1 million in real
estate and vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   At a court hearing Thursday, Phillips appeared wearing plastic
thongs, a pair of rumpled shorts and a T-shirt. He said he is a
licensed residential real estate broker who has lived in Scottsdale
for 25 years and the area for about 40.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by Judge Michael Simonson if he needed a court-appointed
attorney, Phillips said, ``I don't know. I am suffering from a head
injury.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge told Phillips to try to hire an attorney on his own
and set his bail for $160,000.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference earlier in the day called by Maricopa
County Attorney Rick Romley and AHCCCS, state officials said they
have increased efforts to detect fraud.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the agency only investigated doctors and other
providers, but it began looking into member fraud in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, the agency has completed more than 500
investigations and found fraud in 30 percent of them.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said the agency routinely investigates applicants'
claims, checking out Social Security and motor vehicle records,
welfare rolls and employment history.
</P>
<P>
   In July, she said, the agency will add investigators to conduct
more in-depth checks before a person is approved.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the agency will have several weeks to check out
an applicant. Because Phillips was hospitalized already, AHCCCS had
just 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips was injured June 6, 1997, and admitted to St. Joseph's
Hospital and Medical Center. Four days later, he met with an AHCCCS
eligibility worker.
</P>
<P>
   He claimed to be indigent and said he had been living out of his
Volkswagen van. He also said he had to borrow money from his mother
to return to Phoenix from Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said the agency verified the claim about borrowing money.
She said the agency ``had no way of knowing'' about his
out-of-state assets and would have had difficulty tracking the
local property he owns because of his common name.
</P>
<P>
   If officials had checked further, they would have found
Phillips' riches:
</P>
<P>
   The $850,000 investment portfolios with firms in Beverly Hills
and Scottsdale; five homes in the Valley with values ranging from
about $40,000 to $83,000; two parcels of land valued at $30,000;
and three vehicles registered in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   But Phillips was deemed indigent and enrolled in the AHCCCS
program for six months. The agency finally learned about the
alleged fraud last July the way they discover most abuse: through
an anonymous tip.
</P>
<P>
   AHCCCS has had its share of problems in recent years and is the
focus of a federal inquiry into allegations of fraud, abuse and
mismanagement. The three-year investigation stems from charges by
ex-employees that the agency left dead recipients on the rolls,
disabled critical computer checks and retaliated against employees
who spoke out.

   NEW YORK _ Gray Kunz, the chef at Lespinasse, the luxury
restaurant in the St. Regis Hotel, has announced that he is leaving
the restaurant. His last day will be July 25.
</P>
<P>
   Kunz, 42, whose Asian-accented French fare has earned a
four-star rating from The New York Times, said he was hoping to
open his own restaurant in Manhattan. ``A lot of chefs aspire and
dream to own their own place, and I'm no different,'' he said.
``But I feel I need time to reflect. If the people who say they
want to do a restaurant with me are sincere, they will be there for
me in a few months.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his leaving had nothing to do with a union dispute and
brief walkout that occurred last fall, during which Kunz left the
restaurant for almost three weeks. Nor was it related to the change
in ownership of the hotel, Kunz and a spokesman for the St. Regis
said. ITT-Sheraton sold the St. Regis to Starwood Hotels and
Resorts of White Plains last year.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Delouvrier, the chef at Les Celebrites, the three-star
restaurant in the Essex House, will succeed Kunz.

MAXINE PFEFFER, 37, ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY 
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK _ Maxine Pfeffer, an assistant U.S. attorney in
Manhattan whose prosecutions ranged from drug dealing to
international art theft, died on Tuesday at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center after a long battle with cancer. She
was 37.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pfeffer's achievements included her prosecution of 29
organized-crime figures in a major drug-trafficking case in 1994
and helping run a sensitive Justice Department investigation into
allegations that high officials of the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service had deliberately misled Congress about
overcrowding and security problems in the agency's Florida
operations.
</P>
<P>
   She had recently begun to specialize in art law. In one case
last year that drew international attention, she prosecuted three
people accused in the theft and attempted sale of more than $10
million worth of valuable drawings, including works by Rembrandt
and Albrecht Durer.
</P>
<P>
   The drawings had come from a cache of artworks that was
originally part of a collection looted from the Bremen Museum in
Germany at the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Goldblatt, a U.S. Customs agent who worked on the case,
said that Ms. Pfeffer _ whose friends called her Max _ loved art,
and that they would visit museums together in what little spare
time they had.
</P>
<P>
   ``She kept her plate full of art cases,'' Agent Goldblatt said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pfeffer grew up in Brooklyn and attended Harvard, where she
was an editor at The Crimson. After graduation in 1981 she worked
for a year as a paralegal for Linda Fairstein, chief of the Sex
Crimes Prosecution Unit in the Manhattan district attorney's
office, before entering Harvard Law School.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating cum laude from there in 1985, Ms. Pfeffer
worked for three years as an associate in the law firm of Paul,
Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &AMP; Garrison. She specialized in commercial
litigation, but also took on extensive pro bono work in capital
punishment cases. She went to the Southern District U.S. attorney's
office in 1991 and later worked closely there with Mary Jo White,
the chief federal prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pfeffer is survived by her husband, Khalid Chahi of
Manhattan, a son, Sami, and her mother, Shirley Pfeffer of
Brooklyn.
