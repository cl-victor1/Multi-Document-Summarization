<HEADLINE> FIFA Set to Reverse Provision for Over-23 Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- All soocer players taking part
in the next summer Olympic Games will be under the age of 23.
</P>
<P>
FIFA, soccer's world governing body, said on Wednesday that
soccer in the Olympics may revert to being restricted only to
players under the age.
</P>
<P>
The FIFA committee responsible for Olympic soccer proposed
dropping the provision that allows teams to field three players
over 23.
</P>
<P>
The committee said it would ask FIFA's executive board to
reinstate the rule limiting the competition to players under 23.
If approved as expected, the rule will be in effect for the 2000
Olympics in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's announcement will further strain relations between
FIFA and the International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
The provision allowing three over-age players was brought in
for the 1996 Atlanta Games at the urging of the IOC, which hoped
to increase the level of what has mostly been a youth competition.
</P>
<P>
But FIFA, which is eager to protect the supremacy of its own
World Cup, said it believes the Olympic competition is attractive
enough as an under-23 event.
</P>
<P>
Most European countries fielded under-23 teams anyway in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
The FIFA committee also announced the allocation of berths for
the Sydney competition.
</P>
<P>
Australia qualifies automatically as host, as does defending
champion Nigeria. There will be four more spots for Africa, two
for South America, two for the CONCACAF region and three for
Asia. The third team to qualify from Asia will contest a playoff
against the top team from Oceania.
</P>
<P>
For the women's tournament, the eight finalists will consist of
Australia and the top seven from the 1998 World Cup in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The qualifying period will run from August 1, 1998 to April
2000.
</P>
<P>
The men's Olympic final will be played at the main Olympic
stadium in Sydney, with the women's final at the Sydney Football
Ground.

<HEADLINE> Bertrand Remains No. 1 Overall at OOCL Yachting Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Although it was a day for
American Jeff Madrigali who took the fourth race, Australia's
America's Cup legend John Bertrand remained atop of the field at
the 1997 Oriental Overseas Container Line Ltd. (OOCL) Etchells
World Yachting Championships here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a day of light winds, a few new names emerged in the top
positions of Race 4, with Madrigali taking the first place,
followed by Australian Ian Johnson and Denmark's two-time Olympic
champion Poul-Richard Hoj-Jensen.
</P>
<P>
Australian sailmaker and ex-Dennis Connor crew, Michael Coxon,
second in Race 3 on Tuesday, was given a tie for the second place
after winning a protest today.
</P>
<P>
Madrigali got a much needed first place after his
disqualification yesterday due to a lost protest. Australian
Johnson, the second placer today, was a previous unknown in the
championships' first three races.
</P>
<P>
Coxon's fellow sailmaker and countryman Noel Drennan was
fifth. Another sailmaker, American Jud Smith, was sixth, just
ahead of Hong Kong's Mark Thornburrow.
</P>
<P>
Regatta leader Bertrand, who competed five times and won once
in the America's Cup, finished eighth. But race rules allow one
discard out of the six races.
</P>
<P>
Another Etchells champion and America's Cup veteran Colin Beashel
finished twelveth.
</P>
<P>
In the overall regatta standigs, it is Bertrand, Drennan, Coxon,
Hoj-Jensen and then Beashel.
</P>
<P>
Thursday is a lay day, giving the 30 boats and 91 crew members
a much deserved rest. Sailing starts again on Friday with Race 5
and the final race is set for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The OOCL World Championships is the last leg of the OOCL World
Series. Skippers are competing for the OOCL World Series Trophy,
based on their accumulated points over the three-year, four
regatta series.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Ruling Party Probes Vote-Buying Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine ruling
Lakas-NUCD party has started to investigate alleged vote buying in
last Sunday's consultation meeting for selecting a presidential
candidate for the 1998 polls, a presidential aide said today.
</P>
<P>
Presidential adviser for political affairs Gabriel Claudio, who
is also the ruling party's deputy secretary-general, confirmed
that the party's 16-member ad hoc electoral committee has acted to
look into the reported scandal on the order of President Fidel
Ramos.
</P>
<P>
Claudio said the committee is coordinating closely with the
eight contenders for the party's nomination, their supporters and
participants in the consultation meeting, to verify these reports.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that Jose de Venecia, speaker of the House of
Representatives, and former defense secretary Renato S. de Villa
were allegedly engaged in buying votes of participants at Sunday's
caucus, the first round of the party's nomination consultations.
</P>
<P>
Both de Villa and de Venecia have denied engaging in bribery
and other forms of inducement to gain the support of party
members.
</P>
<P>
They said the pre-caucus meetings with caucus participants and
some party leaders were conducted in an open and transparent
manner.
</P>
<P>
Claudio said no formal complaints or evidence had been filed
with or received by the party's electoral committee.
</P>
<P>
Claudio blasted the opposition for playing up and taking
advantage of such unverified reports to discredit the on-going
consultation process and undermine the unity of the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party will hold the second round of consultations
this Sunday, during which party members will choose the party's
presidential bet through secret balloting.
</P>
<P>
Based on the results of the meetings, Lakas Chairman Ramos will
finally nominate the party's presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
Also today, the opposition Struggle of Patriotic Filipino
Masses announced that it had decided to defer its national
convention from late November to December or early January.
</P>
<P>
The party, the country's largest opposition group, is expected
to choose its presidential candidate between Senator Edgardo
Angara and Vice President Joseph Estrada.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here said that the opposition is now trying
to monitor the movements of the ruling party and learn from its
mistakes in the nomination process.

<HEADLINE> German Steel Giant Makes Double Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 12 (Xinhua) -- German steel giant Thyssen, which
is due to merge with its rival Krupp-Hoesch, today said it more
than doubled its profits during the financial 1996-1997 year
ending September 30.
</P>
<P>
The result was one of the best in history and the exact
figures would be released following board meeting at the end of
this month, the company said.
</P>
<P>
In the year 1995-1996, the heavy-industry sector achieved
profits of 610 million marks (359 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Thyssen said the sector turnover was set to top at 40 billion
marks in the financial 1996-1997, compared with 38.7 billion marks
for the previous corresponding period.

<HEADLINE> Jury Selection Begins in Mail Bomb Terrorist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The UNABOMber trial is
getting under way today with jury selection in Sacramento,
California.
</P>
<P>
FBI agents arrested Theodore Kaczynski 19 months ago at his
cabin in rural Montana following one of the most intensive
manhunts in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say they have a great deal of evidence against the
55-year-old former math professor, who's charged with four of the
16 bombings blamed on the notorious UNABOMber, according to news
reports.
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers are expected to try to raise reasonable doubt
in the minds of jurors that the hermit is the same man who placed
or mailed bombs that killed Sacramento computer store owner Hugh
Scrutton in 1985, and timber industry lobbyist Gilbert Murray 10
years later.
</P>
<P>
Legal experts say Kaczynski's best hope is escaping the death
penalty in the second phase of the trial, if he's convicted, on
grounds that he has had lifelong mental problems.
</P>
<P>
In the first phase, jurors must determine if Kaczynski is the
bomber who terrorized the country for 17 years, beginning in 1978.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Garland Burrell Jr. plans to call one dozen
prospective jurors a day, beginning today, until he has a pool of
at least 64.
</P>
<P>
At that point, attorneys will question juror candidates and use
dozens of preemptory challenges to exclude those they consider
unfit. Burrell said he'll form the panel when he has 12 jurors
and six alternates.

<HEADLINE> Political Stability Key to Investment: Namibia's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 12 (Xinhua) -- There is need for southern
African countries to maintain political stability if the region
is to attract further investment in mining, Namibia's General
Manager of the Chamber of Mines John Rogers said today.
</P>
<P>
Rogers told the two-day regional mining conference which
started in Harare Tuesday that the political stability prevailing
in the region is conducive to attracting investors.
</P>
<P>
He said political upheavals often contributed to lack of clear
policies toward the establishment of businesses apart from the
inherent insecurity they posed to investors.
</P>
<P>
Rogers cited vast deposits of mineral wealth in Angola and
Mozambique which had not been exploited due to prolonged civil
wars.
</P>
<P>
''It is encouraging, therefore, that political stability is
increasing in the region which is essential for long-term
commitment needed by mining companies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Rogers said there is need for governments in the region to
continue improving the investment climate.
</P>
<P>
''Political stability and clear fiscal policies will encourage
mining companies to invest in exploration activities which,
hopefully, will result in the development of mines,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the region's economy could grow further by producing
finished mineral products as opposed to semi-finished products.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that mining contributes to approximately 10
percent of the region's gross domestic product, while accounting
for 60 percent of foreign exchange earnings.

<HEADLINE> Full Text of Li's Speech at Reception in Tokyo (Part One) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Li
Peng, who is on a six-day official good-will visit to Japan,
delivered a speech here this afternoon at a welcoming reception
held by Japan-China friendship organizations. The full text of the
speech reads as follows:
Mr. Yoshio Sakurauchi,
Mr. Ikuma Dan,
Ladies, Gentlemen and Friends,
</P>
<P>
At this wonderful season, I feel greatly honored to be given
such a warm and grand reception and I am very glad to have an
opportunity to meet old and new friends who have always been
enthusiastic in promoting Sino-Japanese friendship. On behalf of
my wife and colleagues, I express my heartfelt gratitude to all
the friends here for your profound sentiments of friendship.
</P>
<P>
This year marks the 25th anniversary of the normalization of
the Sino-Japanese diplomatic ties. And next year marks the 20th
anniversary of the signing of the China-Japan Treaty of Peace and
Friendship. Twenty-five years ago, leaders of the two countries
showed great foresight and made the wise decision to normalize
diplomatic ties between the two countries, which opened a new page
for Sino-Japanese relations. With the joint efforts made by the
two governments and the two peoples in the past 25 years, the
China-Japan relations and the cooperation and exchanges in all
areas between the two countries have scored remarkable
progress. This not only greatly benefited both China and Japan,
but contributed to peace and development in the Asia-Pacific
region and the world at large. The hard-earned development of
Sino-Japanese relations is an embodiment of the painstaking labor
and efforts made by people from several generations in the two
countries, including all the friends here. The Chinese and
Japanese peoples know the old saying, "When you drink water, think
of those who dug the well." Let us bear firmly in mind the
pioneers who work hard to normalize the diplomatic ties between
the two countries, and people from various circles who have been
making efforts to maintain and develop the Sino-Japanese friendly
ties. On behalf of the Chinese government and people, I avail
myself of this opportunity to renew to all Japan-China friendship
organizations and Japanese friends the assurances of my highest
consideration.

<HEADLINE> Asian Countries Try to Rebuild "Silk Road" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Asian countries along the old
"silk road" will have a first regional conference next week in
Turkmenistan to draft a transit transport framework agreement.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaidjan, China,
Georgia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Russia,
Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan will take part in
the conference convened by the United Nation Conference on Trade
and Development (UNCTAD) and financed by the UN Development
Program.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the conference to be held on November 18-20 in
Ashgabad, Turkmenistan, is to lay the basis for a solid regional
regulatory framework that will make transit operations in Central
Asia efficient and cost effective, thus promoting the external
trade of the sub-region and bolstering its economic growth, the
UNCTAD said in a press release here today.
</P>
<P>
The UNCTAD secretariat has prepared a blueprint for a transit
transport framework agreement that will provide an effective
institutional framework for the region-wide coordination of
transit transport policies. This will include the harmonization of
technical standards of regional transport networks, as well as the
simplifying and harmonizing of customs procedures.

<HEADLINE> Russia, China to Skirt U.S. Dollar with Mutual Payments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 12 (Xinhua) -- It is possible for Russia and
China to conduct mutual investments and settlements without using
the U.S. dollar, President of the Russian Union of Industrialists
and Entrepreneurs Arkady Volsky said here today.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was made at the first meeting of the
Russian-Chinese Committee for Peace and Development in the 21st
Century in Beijing on November 10, Volsky told Interfax Tuesday
upon the completion of Russian President Boris Yeltsin's China
tour.
</P>
<P>
He said the proposal that the price of the yuan be set in
roubles sparked arguments; it was decided to calculate the figure
based on "labor input."
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of the new structure is to help the two
countries handle, within the context of economic reforms, specific
tasks, primarily those related to the development of
Russian-Chinese economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the bilateral Committee's 1998 work plan has not
been finalized due to the large number of proposals submitted by
both sides, Volsky explained.
</P>
<P>
He said the Committee's efforts to boost economic links between
the two countries has already led to positive changes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russia's May Tea Association held talks. As a
result, China may recover its leading position with regard to tea
exports to Russia, he added.

<HEADLINE> No Progress in Peace Prevents Egypt From Doha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa today blamed the impasse in the Mideast process for Egypt's
decision of non-participation in a controversial economic meeting
slated to open in Qatar Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Moussa made the statement after a meeting with President Hosni
Mubarak, Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri and other key cabinet
members to assess the current situation in the domestic and
regional arena.
</P>
<P>
Egypt Tuesday decided to boycott the imminent Middle East and
North Africa economic conference as it saw little chance of
breaking up the Israeli-Palestinian crisis which has been in place
since March due to Israel's construction of a Jewish settlement in
Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on his meeting here Tuesday with the Palestinian
peace negotiators who attended the latest round of talks with the
Israelis in Washington, Moussa described the situation as "critical"
and downplayed hopes for a breakthrough in the stalled talks.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said over the coming two days, U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright will hold talks with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, in
London and Bern.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that there will be progress, but let's ask ourselves
as Egyptian diplomats: what is next?" Moussa said, voicing his
pessimism.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Moussa said the present peace stalemate,
Israeli negative policies and the lack of progress on all tracks
of the peacemaking were behind Egypt's decision not to take part
in the Doha conference.
</P>
<P>
In an interview granted this morning to the BBC, Moussa said "a
grave situation and unjustified backtracking" obliged Egypt to
adopt this decision.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt's non-participation decision does not aim to embarrass
anyone but rather it aims at addressing a sound message at a
proper time," Moussa said.

<HEADLINE> Southern Africa to Experience Water Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The drought-prone southern
African region is projected to experience a crippling decline of
fresh water supply between now and 2050, according to a book
released here today.
</P>
<P>
The book by the U.S.-based International Food Policy Research
Institute is entitled ''Achieving Food Security in Southern
Africa: New Challenges and Opportunities''.
</P>
<P>
It says the water shortages could push the region to the brink
of disaster unless steps are taken to regulate water supply.
</P>
<P>
Countries experience water stress when their fresh water
resources are between 1,000 and 1,600 cubic meters per person and
are in serious trouble if resources drop below 1,000 cubic meters
per capita.
</P>
<P>
The book says Zimbabwe's fresh water resources are projected
to fall from 2,323 cubic meters per capita in 1990 to 864 cubic
meters per capita in 2050.
</P>
<P>
The situation would not be so bad in Namibia which is said to
have ''relative abundance of fresh water resources of 6,672 cubic
meters per capita in 1990 projected to drop to 2,162 by the year
2050''.
</P>
<P>
''Such declines could have serious effect on food production
in the region,'' the book says. ''Agriculture is by far the
biggest consumer of water resources and the most inefficient
user.
</P>
<P>
''Projections are that Africa will need to triple its
agricultural production in the period 1990 to 2025 to achieve
food security for its growing population,'' the book says.
</P>
<P>
According to the book, steps should be taken now to regulate
water supply to ensure that farming in the region begins to grow
enough food for the population.
</P>
<P>
The southern Africa region includes Angola, Botswana, Lesotho,
Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa,
Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The region is this year facing threat of an El Nino-induced
drought.

<HEADLINE> EU Proposes Conclusion of EU-US Veterinary Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BRUSSELS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
European Union (EU)'s executive body, today decided to conclude
its veterinary agreement with the United States for animals and
animal products.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the agreement is to facilitate the trade of
live animals and animal products by establishing a mechanism for
the recognition of equivalent sanitary measures on both sides.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which will be put to the European Council of
Ministers for final approval, was put forward by Franz Fischler,
EU commissioner for agriculture and rural development, according
to a press release issued Wednesday in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The recognition by an importing country of sanitary measures
applied by an exporting country could permit greater efficient
utilization of inspection and verification, the EU noted.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Fischler's proposal includes lists of those commodities
for which equivalence is recognized.
</P>
<P>
The total trade between the EU and the U.S. in the products
covered by this draft agreement for 1995 was about 1.5 billion
U.S. dollars in each direction.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations of similar agreements are under way with New
Zealand, the Czech Republic, Australia, Canada, Uruguay, Chile and
Argentina.

<P>
LONDON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- European Economic and Monetary
Union (EMU) is 90 percent likely to be launched on time, a Reuters
poll showed today.
</P>
<P>
This is the highest prediction since the survey began a year
ago, according to the mean prediction from 47 Europe-based
economists and think-tanks.
</P>
<P>
As EMU's chances reached new heights, the likelihood of more
countries joining in the first wave on January 1999 also climbed,
the survey, conducted between November 5 and 10, showed.
</P>
<P>
All 47 experts said that Spain and Portugal would like to join
EMU in the first wave.
</P>
<P>
Italy's chances have soared over the past year. Just 7 percent
of respondents saw Italy in the first wave in November 1996 -- now
that figure has soared to 91 percent in the latest survey.
</P>
<P>
Finland has always been a likely member, although one
contributor to the poll still felt it would fail to make the grade
in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
But most polled experts felt Finland would choose to enter
along with Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Only Sweden, Britain, Denmark and Greece were deemed no-hopers
in the race to join EMU in 1999.
</P>
<P>
British Finance Minister Gordon Brown has effectively ruled out
British membership during the current parliament. But he told
business leaders Monday that the government would act so that
Britain could join EMU soon after the next election -- due by 2002
-- if it wanted to.
</P>
<P>
The Labor government has promised to hold a referendum on the
issue, but Britons are traditionally Euro-sceptic and many experts
feel it will be an uphill battle to convince the country to sign
up to a single currency in 2002.
</P>
<P>
Denmark has already opted out of EMU while the Swedish
government has said it does not plan to join from the start,
leaving the door open for eventual membership later. The survey
showed they too were likely to join three years after the launch
of EMU.
</P>
<P>
Greece sees itself joining the single currency by the end of
2001 and experts in the survey believed it to join EMU in summer
of that year.

<HEADLINE> Russia Urges Iraq to Abide by UN Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Russia today asked Iraq to
immediately end the restrictions on the U.N. special commission
in charge of ridding Iraq of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Valery Nesterushkin was
quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying that if Iraq did so,
the U.N. Security Council would rule out the need of further
coordination between the member states on the tightening of
sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Russia's view on the issue is that Iraq must be given a
realistic prospect of overcoming its economic problems provided it
meets the demands of the international community, Nesterushkin
said.
</P>
<P>
He cautioned the Security Council should not take advantage of
the tense situation around Iraq to authorize any use of force
against it.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted the gravity of the situation around Iraq
should not be underestimated.
</P>
<P>
He finally called for the international community to come to an
understanding with Baghdad and persuade it to resume constructive
cooperation with UN special commission.

<HEADLINE> Somali Doctors Offer to Help Flood Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, November 12 (Xinhua) -- A group of doctors today
announced that they would volunteer to serve the flood victims in
Southern Somalia as the heavy rains of the Deyr season continue
with rivers bursting their banks.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting by the medical staff of Dr Hassan Jiis Memorial
Hospital, the doctors have unanimously agreed to send five
doctors and 15 nurses to southern Somalia in an effort to save
the lives of hundreds of thousands of flood victims by providing
emergency medical assistance.
</P>
<P>
However, the doctors underlined that the essential drugs and
logistics are beyond the capacity of their hospital.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Abdi Mohamed Elmi Hangul, the director of the hospital,
said his team is the first to respond to what he called the human
holocaust resulted from the floods and the endemic malaria.
</P>
<P>
Hangul appealed to the international community to assist them
with tents, medicine and food to help the flood victims.
</P>
<P>
In a similar response, a local Islamic committee for the
coordination of the humanitarian efforts has called on Somali
scholars to start a campaign to collect food, clothes and
house-hold utensils for the flood victims of the country.
</P>
<P>
The committee has urged the flood-affected villagers to form
their own committees to coordinate the humanitarian efforts.
"Moslems should not remain back seated and wait for international
assistance all the time," said a statement issued in Mogadishu
today.
</P>
<P>
The statement signed by three Moslem scholars said the Sheikhs
should start a public awareness campaign with the participation
of the women groups and the business community. "the women should
volunteer to walk from house to house to collect what each family
can afford," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The floods in the Southern regions of Somalia are believed to
have affected nearly one million people and claimed the lives of
more than 100 people including children and the elderly since the
beginning of the Deyr season more than a month ago.
</P>
<P>
Both Jubba and Shabelle, the two rivers of Somalia, have burst
their banks and destroyed dozens of riverside villages and
thousands of hectares of farmland.
</P>
<P>
The largest affected town so far is Beledweyne where the fate
of 170 patients in the main hospital remains unknown.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that serious public reaction is
attracted since the Ethiopian fighting with the Al-Itihad Moslen
fundamentalists became dormant early in the year when the mosques
in the capital called for Holy Jihad against the "Ethiopian
invaders".

<TEXT>
<P>
China and Japan, close neighbors separated by only a strip of
water, are important countries in Asia and the world. With
profound changes in the world and the growing trend of
multipolarization, China and Japan should establish and develop
long-term, stable and friendly cooperative ties, which are not
only in the fundamental interests of the two peoples, but
conducive to peace and development in the Asia-Pacific region and
the world at large. China and Japan should treat their relations
from a long-term and strategic perspective and guide the
developmental direction of their ties. I think the basic
principles of guiding the development of Sino-Japanese ties should
read as follows:
</P>
<P>
-- Mutual respect and non-interference into each other's
internal affairs. Respect the other's choice of its developing
path, which is made according to its national conditions. Surpass
the differences of the two countries on social systems, values and
ideologies. Develop bilateral friendly ties on the basis of the
Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.
</P>
<P>
-- To seek common ground while reserving differences, and
properly handle the differences. Strictly adhere to the principles
enshrined in the Sino-Japanese Joint Statement and the China-Japan
Treaty of Peace and Friendship. Remove disturbances, properly
solve the existing problems and problems likely to occur in the
future between the two countries through peaceful consultations
and from a strategic perspective of maintaining friendly ties
between the two countries. The differences between the two
countries should not become obstacles in the way of developing
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
-- To increase dialogues and promote mutual
understanding. Increase the dialogues and exchanges between the
two countries at all levels and in different fields. Enhance
mutual trust and expand common understanding through timely
exchanges of views on issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
-- Mutual benefit and developing economic cooperation. Expand
the economic and trade cooperation between the two countries from
a long-term perspective and on the basis of equality and mutual
benefit. Further raise the level of cooperation and achieve common
development through an exchange of each other's experience and
advantages.
</P>
<P>
-- To look into the future and develop bilateral friendship
from generation to generation. Carry forward the tradition of
friendly cooperation between the two countries and educate the
young generation with correct historic concepts so as to have the
Sino-Japanese friendship passed on from generation to generation.

<HEADLINE> Mandela to Visit Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 12 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela will visit Saudi Arabia at the weekend, the
Department of Foreign Affairs said today.
</P>
<P>
The scheduled visit, from November 16 to 17, is aimed at
promoting trade and investment, the president's office said, but
declined to give details.
</P>
<P>
Public Enterprises Minister Stella Sigcau, Defense Minister
Joe Modise and Mineral and Energy Affairs Minister Penuell Maduna
will accompany Mandela during his visit to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
In addition to meeting Saudi Monarch King Fahd, Mandela will
also meet other members of the royal family and other senior
government ministers.
</P>
<P>
Sigcau, Modise, Maduna and Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister
Aziz Pahad would in turn discuss various issues of bilateral
concern with their Saudi counterparts, the Foreign Affairs
Department said.
</P>
<P>
Relations between South Africa and Saudi Arabia had improved
significantly since the establishment of diplomatic relations in
October 1994, it noted.
</P>
<P>
Local press earlier this year reported that South Africa was
offering to buy oil from Saudi Arabia as a counter trade
arrangement in a proposed seven billion Rand (146 million U.S.
Dollars) arms deal, but neither government has confirmed this.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the volume of trade between the two
countries has increased fourfold from 251 million Rand (more than
50 million U.S. Dollars) in 1994 to 1.36 billion Rand (283
million U.S. Dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is also becoming increasingly important as a
supplier of crude oil to South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Iraq: More US Violations of Air Space </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Iraq said today that there
have been an escalated violations by U.S. war and spy planes of
its air space.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here, Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed
al-Sahhaf also called for Arab support for Iraq in the
Iraq-U.S. standoff and accused the U.S. for blackmailing the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
There have been 984 violations of air space in both north and
south Iraq by U.S. planes since 29 October, he said, adding a TR-1
spy plane has joined the U2 reconnaissance plane already in
operation over Iraq in a daily mission.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Iraq will shoot down one of the planes if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
He has sent letters to the United Nations in protest against
such escalation of sovereignty breaches against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister called for Arabs' awareness of the
U.S. "dangerous games" which is blamed for the current crisis in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has announced to expel U.S. citizens of the U.N. inspection
team in charge of destruction of mass destructive weapons saying
they are spys, but its has suspended action pending a
U.N. position towards the crisis. The U.S. has threatened with
military action and been pushing for a Security Council resolution
denouncing Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. is creating such a crisis to divert people's
attention from listening to Iraq's just call for lifting of the
seven-year-old U.N. sanctions which were imposed after the 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
He said Arab countries like Egypt, Jordan and Syria have
adopted very good stance in support of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf also called on Arab countries not to allow the U.S. to
use their territories as bases for launching attacks on Iraq. He
expressed appreciation to a number of countries which have refused
to let the U.S. to do so.
</P>
<P>
He also said that his country is in contact with U.N. Security
Council members, who have complained of "blackmailing and
pressure" from the U.S. for reaching a resolution hostile to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq will "definitely" expel American inspectors if the
Security Council reaches a tough resolution toward it, he said,
but without giving details.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions cannnot be lifted until the inspectors
verify that Iraq has eliminated all its weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
He also said Iraq is ready to "answer any U.S. aggression,"
adding history has proved that U.S. would launch an aggression
against another country without permission from anyone.

<HEADLINE> Final Efforts Being Made for Diplomatic Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Diplomats are still
making their final consultations for a diplomatic solution to the
arms inspection crisis in Iraq although the United Nations
Security Council is going to meet this noon to schedule a vote on
a draft resolution on imposing new measures against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of some of the Security Council members have
been persuading Iraq to rescind an order late last month to expel
Americans from the U.N. arms inspection team.
</P>
<P>
They have also insisted that Security Council resolution
contain no use or threat of military forces to punish Iraq for its
order.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret stressed
earlier in the day that the U.N. resolution "does not in any way
foresee the use of force" against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Sergey Lavrov, Russian ambassador to the United Nations, said
late Tuesday that Russia "cannot accept any use of force because
it leads us nowhere."
</P>
<P>
But the United States and Britain have been making efforts to
persuade other Security Council members to join their
condemnations against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-Britain draft resolution condemns Iraq's actions,
including threatening to shoot down American-piloted U-2 spy
planes operating in support of the U.N. weapons inspection team.
</P>
<P>
It demands that Iraq rescind its decision and cooperate
unconditionally with the U.N. Special Commission in charge of
scrapping Iraq's chemical, biological and missile stocks under the
1991 Gulf War cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
The two states are also seeking to impose a travel ban on Iraqi
officials responsible for disrupting U.N. weapons inspections in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, Iraq said earlier today that it would not bow to an
"oppressive" U.N. resolution.
</P>
<P>
Underlining its resolve, Iraqi officials have reportedly barred
for the ninth time in 10 days American members of the U.N.
monitoring teams from taking part in its work.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has said that the ban on Americans would remain unless
inspectors were neutral and a timetable was set for lifting the
U.N. sanctions imposed when Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.

<P>
We are at a historically important turn of the century. Society
has experienced unforgettable times in the 20th century. Two world
wars left deep wounds and misfortune to mankind. The postwar
period saw civil wars and turmoil and many other regional
conflicts accompanied by a Cold War that lasted more than 40 years.
</P>
<P>
People of the whole world have paid a heavy price for pursuing
and defending peace. To our great comfort, the world has scored a
great economic victory overall in development and social progress
during the postwar decades.
</P>
<P>
Though the Cold War has ended, the world is still far from
peaceful as irrational international political and economic
disorder remains. The relations between the North and the South
hemispheres have not been improved and many countries are still
undeveloped with their people living in poverty and deplorable
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Thus peace and development are not only the theme of today's
world but also the world of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
China, the biggest developing country, and Japan, a developed
country, should enhance their coordination and cooperation in
regional and world affairs to contribute to peace and development
regionally and in the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
It is good for all nations that Japan chose a way of peaceful
development after World War II. It scored economic success and saw
its status in the international community enhanced.

<HEADLINE> Violence Still Rampant in Karachi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The killing of four American
citizens and their Pakistani driver by unidentified gunmen in
Karachi today has sounded a fresh warning that violence is still
rampant in Pakistan's largest city.
</P>
<P>
The violent incident occurred at 8:20 a.m. in the southern port
city, and the five dead were identified as the employees of Union
Texas Pakistan (UTP), a subsidiary of Union Texas Petroleum
Holdings Inc.
</P>
<P>
Sources from Karachi said the four Americans, who were on a
visit in connection with some official work at the company, were
shot dead on their way from Karachi Sheraton Hotel to their office
about three kilometers away.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitnesses, the attackers were in a red Honda
Civic, which was later found abandoned in the south of the city.
</P>
<P>
The incident came only one day after a 12-member American jury
declared a Pakistani national, Aimal Kansi, guilty of killing two
agents of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and wounding three
others in a shooting outside the CIA Headquarters in January 1993.
</P>
<P>
It is still unknown whether this incident has something to do
with the conviction of Kansi by the U.S. jury. An investigation is
under way and The Karachi police force has been put on full alert.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's Federal Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif, met here this afternoon to discuss the tragic incident.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet, voicing its shock and anguish over the attack,
directed the Sindh Provincial government to take all necessary
steps to track down the attackers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pakistani President Farooq Leghari strongly
condemned the killing as a "despicable act" and said the
government is determined to arrest the gunmen.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to apprehend the criminals swiftly and award
them severe punishment," Leghari said in a condolence message to
U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sharif, in a message to Clinton, also strongly
condemned the "act of terrorism" and said he was deeply shocked to
learn of the incident.
</P>
<P>
"We will spare no endeavor to apprehend and punish the
perpetrators of this heinous crime," Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan said Pakistani authorities
"will leave no stone unturned in apprehending the criminals who
carried out this dastardly act and exemplary punishment would be
given to them."
</P>
<P>
A. G. Hoffman, president of Union Texas Pakistan, has termed
the killing of five of its employees as "terrible and tragic."
</P>
<P>
The company does not know the reason behind the attack, said
Hoffman, adding that his company is fully cooperating with local
officials in their investigation.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Embassy officials here declined to make any comment on the
killing, saying only that they were still gathering details of the
incident.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) 100-Index plunged
across the board on the news of the killing this morning.
</P>
<P>
KSE 100-Index fell by 39.43 points to 1,827.07 as prices of 79
companies dipped and only 28 were up.

<HEADLINE> Large Majority of UK Voters Back Privacy Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Nearly nine out of 10 British
people support a privacy law to protect public figures against
media intrusion, according to an opinion poll published today.
</P>
<P>
The new Guardian/ICM poll, which interviewed a random sample of
1,200 adults across the country, showed that 87 percent to 10
percent voters back a privacy law.
</P>
<P>
It also found that nearly six out of 10 people think the
current system of self-regulation operated by the Press Complaints
Commission is not working, indicating that people's resentment
against tabloids has not diminished in the two months since
Princess Diana's death.
</P>
<P>
As to the question of who should be protected by such a new
law, more than 80 percent believe the private lives of the royal
family in particular should be included.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some 55 percent to 42 percent also believe that the
private lives of public figures such as pop stars and celebrities
should be given the protection of the law.
</P>
<P>
However, a clear majority said that the private lives of
politicians and crime suspects should not be protected.
</P>
<P>
The poll also showed that some 55 percent now think Britain
would be worse off without the royal family, compared with only 48
percent in August, but still far short of the 70 percent plus
support given to the royals as recently as in 1994.

<TEXT>
<P>
We hope the Japanese government and people will continue to
develop in the direction of peace despite obstructions. Only in
this way can Japan win understanding and respect in the world,
play a more active role in international affairs, and make greater
contribution to global peace and development.
Friends,
</P>
<P>
China is committing itself to building a modern socialism. The
15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China held
recently summed up the success stories in the country's reform and
opening up, such as the ongoing endeavor to achieve modernization
for the past twenty years, defining Deng Xiaoping's Theory as our
guilding ideology, electing a new central leadership with Jiang
Zemin at the core, and drawing up the blueprint for China's future
development.
</P>
<P>
Our goal is to achieve basic modernization by the middle of the
next century. To achieve that we need to secure a long-term
peaceful international environment and maintain good relations
with surrounding countries. China is a staunch force safeguarding
world peace. China's development will pose no threat to any other
country. China will never seek hegemony even when it becomes
developed in the future. China upholds an independent foreign
policy of peace and attaches great importance to developing good
relations with surrounding countries.
</P>
<P>
It has been China's consistent policy to build and develop
long-term stable friendship and cooperation with Japan. I firmly
believe that a long-term stable good-neighborly relationship
between China and Japan will not only benefit our own peoples but
will also be conducive to world peace and human progress.
</P>
<P>
Thank you.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Have "Virtual" National Securities Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Canada's provincial securities
regulators are prepared to set up a "virtual" national securities
commission by the end of next year, a report said today.
</P>
<P>
Now they are in the process of harmonizing many of their rules
and procedures, and designing a national framework for mutual
reliance.
</P>
<P>
A memorandum of understanding is expected to be signed next
spring, with the new initiatives to be in effect by the end of
next year, the Financial Post newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
That would mean many areas previously handled provincially,
such as prospectus review, registration of brokers and dealers,
exemption applications, will be consistent and run by a lead
regulator with the help of improved technology.
</P>
<P>
The virtual commission will achieve most of the efficiences
that would have been obtained through a national securities
commission, an idea that has been talked for some 30 years but has
yet to find enough political support.
</P>
<P>
Stock trading in Canada is now regulated by 12 jurisdictions,
making it heavily relied on local regulators.
</P>
<P>
The virtual national securities commission will help eliminate
inefficiencies while preserve the role of local regulators to deal
with local market issues, according to Bill Hess, chairman of the
Alberta Securities Commission.
</P>
<P>
For investors, it will mean more protection, since provincial
commissions can free up resources that are duplicating efforts of
other jurisdictions and enhance enforcement and compliance, Hess
added.

<HEADLINE> Angola to Train Congo (K) Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Angola would help train rapid
intervention police and frontier police for Democratic Congo (K)
starting from the later half of the month, a senior official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Pitra Retroff, Angola's Internal Minister revealed this news
to reporters before he left Luanda for a Lusaka visit.
</P>
<P>
Retroff said that they are doing this to guarantee the safety
and peace along their border, adding that an official from the
Internal Ministry of Congo (K) had paid a visit to Angola to
acquaint himself with the specific conditions for the training.
</P>
<P>
He said the training program was outlined in a cooperation
agreement between Angola and Congo (K) during Congolese President
Laurent Kabila's first visit to Angola on August 5-6.
</P>
<P>
Retroff, who is to attend the defense and security conference
of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) in Lusaka,
said he would brief the participants on the current situation of
Angola's peace process and appeal to them to cooperate with
Angola in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said the situation along the government controlled borders
is peaceful and stable, but things are quite different along the
northern and northeastern boundaries with Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
Unidentified aircraft have been spotted flying over the
northern and noutheastern parts of the country bordering Zambia,
which is under the control of the former rebel movement of the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, he said.

<HEADLINE> France Denies Interfering in Algeria's Internal Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- France today denied that it had
interfered into the internal affairs of Algeria with the holding
of "One Day for Algeria" demonstrations in Paris and other French
cities Monday by tens of thousands of French people in support of
Algerian people.
</P>
<P>
"It is the solidarity which should be our primary priority
toward Algeria," said French Minister for European Affairs Pierre
Moscovici.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian government has expressed regret that the French
government actually "supported" the demonstrations which were
initiatived by non-governmental groups of France to show
solidarity of the French people with the Algerian people.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, called by trade unions, humanitarian
organizations and associations, also urged the international
community to launch an inquiry into the massacres of civilians in
Algeria.
</P>
<P>
"What is clear today is that the French society expresses its
most entire solidarity with the Algerian people. It did it under
the form of associations. It is not interference but well and
truly solidarity," said Moscovici.
</P>
<P>
French government spokeswoman Catherine Trautmann and a Foreign
Ministry spokeswoman had expressed support to the demonstrations,
triggering criticism from the Algerian government, who said that
it contradicted with the repeated promise by France not to
interfere into the internal affairs of Algeria.
</P>
<P>
Moscovici recalled that the French government had never ceased
to condemn terrorism and what he called "blind violence which is
striking Algeria."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Algerian people were subjected to murder and
sufferings, and they hoped more than ever to be living in peace.
</P>
<P>
"They need protection and security. We don't know what is going
on in Algeria. We need more information, transparency and that
comes first and foremost by the possibility that foreign media
work more (in Algeria)," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He said that "non-interference, solidarity, transparency and
security" were the principles which would guide France in its
policy toward Algeria.

<HEADLINE> Guiding Principles of Development of China-Japan Ties Noted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng, who is
on a six-day official good-will visit to Japan, today pointed out
several basic principles of guiding the development of China-Japan
ties.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech here at a welcoming reception jointly held
by Japan-China friendship organizations, Li Peng said that the
first principle is mutual respect and non-interference in each
other's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The two countries should respect each other's choice regarding
the paths of development, which are made according to the
country's national conditions, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The differences between the two countries' social systems,
values and ideologies should be surpassed and development of
bilateral friendly ties should be based on the Five Principles of
Peaceful Coexistence, he added.
</P>
<P>
The second principle is to seek common ground while reserving
differences, and to handle the differences properly, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries must strictly adhere to the principles
enshrined in the Sino-Japanese Joint Statement and the China-Japan
Treaty of Peace and Friendship, the Chinese premier noted.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng called for the removal of disturbances between the two
countries and the proper settlement of problems through peaceful
consultations and from a strategic perspective of maintaining
China-Japan friendly ties.
</P>
<P>
"The differences between the two countries should not become
obstacles in the way of developing bilateral relations," he added.
</P>
<P>
The third principle is to increase dialogue and promote mutual
understanding, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries should increase dialogue and exchanges at all
levels and in different fields, and enhance mutual trust and
expand common understanding through timely exchanges of views on
issues of common concern, he added.
</P>
<P>
The fourth principle is to develop bilateral economic
cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries should expand their economic and trade
cooperation from a long-term perspective and further raise the
level of cooperation through an exchange of each other's
experience and advantages, he added.
</P>
<P>
The fifth principle is to carry forward the tradition of
friendly cooperation between the two countries and educate the
young generation with correct historic concepts so as to have the
Sino-Japanese friendship passed on from generation to generation,
Li said.
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing the importance of China and Japan in Asia and the
world, Li said that with profound changes in the world and the
growing trend of multipolarization, the two countries should
establish and develop long-term, stable and friendly cooperative
ties.
</P>
<P>
"Such relations are not only in the fundamental interests of
the two peoples, but conducive to peace and development in the
Asia-Pacific region and the world," he added.

<HEADLINE> Canada Should Pay Down National Debt: OECD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Canada should use its budget
surplus to begin paying down its massive national debt, said the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
</P>
<P>
In its latest survey of the Canadian economy, the OECD noted
that the country's federal and provincial governments are well on
their way to balancing their annual fiscal deficit and surpluses
may start to emerge.
</P>
<P>
Canada now leads the Group of Seven countries in terms of the
federal government's fiscal performance. Before the 1990s, its
fiscal record was the worst in the G7.
</P>
<P>
Canada has a national debt of 600 billion dollars (430 billion
US dollars). Its debt-to-GDP ratio, which stood at 73.1 percent at
the end of March, is the third highest among OECD countries.
</P>
<P>
"Given the relatively high level of public debt... priority
should be given to using these surpluses to put the ratio on a
clear downward trend," the organization said.
</P>
<P>
A lower debt-to-GDP ratio would reduce the risk premium on
Canada's debt and its vulnerability to future economic shocks.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government has said that the debt-to-GDP ratio
will be lowered over time by running balanced budgets in the near
future.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Imposes Military Rule Against Revolt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese government today
decided to impose a three-month military rule in eastern region
of Baalbek-Hermel as of today in a bid to crush a
four-month-old anti-government revolt.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at today's three-hour cabinet session
chaired by Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and in the presence of
President Elias Hrawi.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, the president said that it is unacceptable
to call for civil disobedience mutiny. He warned parliamentary
members and cabinet ministers not to visit the Bekka-Hermel
region.
</P>
<P>
He referred to radical Shitte Muslim cleric Sheikh Sobhi
Tufaili who is leading the civil disobedience mutiny which started
on July 4.
</P>
<P>
Tufaili, former general secretary of pro-Iranian Hezbollah,
accused the government of neglecting the impoverished rural
areas and focusing the attention mainly on large cities.
</P>
<P>
He called on the residents in the Baalbek-Hermel to refuse to
pay electricity bills and occupy public properties.
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, his self-styled "hunger revolt" came to a
head-on collision with the government when he sent his followers
to set up checkpoints on all approaches of Baalbek, declaring
an entry ban against Hariri and his 29 cabinet ministers as well
as "unsympathetic" parliament members.
</P>
<P>
"The move aims at grabbing the whole region from the
government and the Lebanese people," Hrawi said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the situation compels us to take action to
prevent any activity from threatening the country's stability
and security.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese Arabic-language radio The Orient said that the
leaders of the government will meet again within the next two
weeks to discuss an emergency U.S. aid worth 100 million
U.S. dollars to the region in order to balance the military
crackdown.

</P>
<P>
Li pointed out that peace and development are not only the
theme of today's world but also the world of the 21st century.
</P>

<HEADLINE> SPD-Greens Coalition Government Takes Over in Hamburg </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Social Democrat (SPD) Ortwin
Runde was today elected new mayor of the northern German
city-state of Hamburg, heading a coalition government with the
envonmentalist Greens.
</P>
<P>
This makes Hamburg the fifth out of 16 federal states ruled
now by alliance of the two German opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Runde's cabinet will have eight SPD ministers, three Greens
ministers and one independent member. The two parties signed the
coalition agreement last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Runde succeeded outgoing veteran SPD mayor Henning Voscherau,
who stepped down after the SPD received its worst postwar result
in regional elections in Hamburg, which used to be its northern
stronghold.
</P>
<P>
The SPD saw its share of the vote in the September elections
down to 36.2 percent. Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian
Democratic Party (CDU) obtained 30.7 percent of the vote while the
Greens won 13.9 percent. All the other parties failed to meet the
5 percent mark to qualify for representation.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian, Angolan Entrepreneurs to Strengthen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 12 (Xinhua ) -- Entrepreneurs from Brazil and
Angola are to take common actions to inject new vigor into the
two countries' economy.
</P>
<P>
Antoio Gomes, Secretary general of Angola's Association of
Trade and Industry, made the statement here today after the first
meeting between the Angolan entrepreneurs and their visiting
Brazilian counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Gomes said that economy in his country has suffered a lot from
the civil war, and wished Brazilian entrepreneurs to find new
fields for cooperation apart from the traditional sectors of
construction and oil industry.
</P>
<P>
He said that entrepreneurs are the main impetus to promote a
country's development.
</P>
<P>
Addor Neto, Brazilian Ambassador to Angola, said the aim of
Brazilian entrepreneurs' visit is to establish contact with their
Angolan counterparts and discuss ways of cooperation, so as to
strengthen taies in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Now that the armed conflicts are over, Angola, which has been
plagued by severe difficulties during the two decades of civil
war, should find it unreasonable not to expand cooperation
between Brazil and Angola, the Brazilian ambassador noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that governments of both countries have expressed
their hope for more investment from Brazil in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian delegation with three dozens of businessmen
arrived in Luanda Monday for a seven-day visit to the country.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Govt Rejects Confederation Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese government
negotiators, led by Foreign Minister Ali Osman Mohammad Taha,
today rejected rebel's demand for forming a north-south
confederation in Sudan where civil war has lasted for 14 years.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, presented by the Sudan People's Liberation Army
(SPLA) at the talks with the government which started here on
October 29 and ending Tuesday, is "irrelevant and illogical",
Taha said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
"This demand is illogical because the concept of confederalism
can only exist between sovereign states but Sudan is still one
country," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The talks, the first since 1994, lasted nearly two weeks with
only one agreement reached by the two sides -- The peace talks is
to resume in April next year.
</P>
<P>
"Talks have been a positive exercise whereby the bottom line
of each side has been investigated, but not yet clearly marked.
The exchange of views here will definitely help," Taha said.
</P>
<P>
At the talks brokered by the Inter-Governmental Authority of
Development (IGAD), Khartoum accepted the principle of
self-determination as a means of resolving the 14-year conflict,
but asking a federation instead of confederation.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks on Sudan stalled in 1994 when Khartoum refused to
accept an IGAD-drafted document containing the principle of
self-determination for south Sudan, but recent military defeats
and international pressures forced it back to the negotiating
table late September.

<HEADLINE> Khamenei Calls for Strengthening Iran's Armed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Supreme Leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei today called for the strengthening the
country's armed forces, terming it as one of the most pressing
need of the nation.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a graduation ceremony at the Imam Ali Officers
College here, Khamenei also termed the importance of vision and
faith as underlying factors strengthening the strength and
efficiency of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
"The (Iran-Iraq) war and many conspiracies before and after
it along with various antagonistic measures by the enemies of
Islam have convinced the Iranian nation and its government that
the strengthening of the country's armed forces is the most
pressing of necessities," he said.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei noted that "a nation which can't defend its
independence and dignity, even with a wealth of natural and
spiritual resources as well as noble goals can have no hopes of
achieving its ideals."
</P>
<P>
He called on the cadets of the college to arm themselves with
spirituality and faith besides learning the latest military
skills, saying that the armed forces should defend the ideals,
independence and honor of the nation as well as the country's
borders.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian leader warned the country's armed forces of the
presence of foreign military forces close to Iran's borders,
saying that the arrogant powers, relying on their technical and
financial capabilities, do their utmost to prevent other nations
from harnessing their cultural, financial and spiritual
resources for their own benefit.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that "the presence of the seemingly strong
forces of the aggressors in the Persian Gulf region and in close
proximity of the Iranian territory does not frighten or shake
this nation."
</P>
<P>
Iran repeatedly announced its opposition to the presence of
foreign military forces in the oil-rich Gulf region, terming it
as a threat to the regional security and stability.
</P>
<P>
Tehran stated that the regional security and stability should
be maintained by the regional countries through mutual
understanding and cooperation.

Quoting a Chinese saying which means not to forget those who
dug the well when drinking water, Li said China and Japan can not
develop without those who made great efforts to the normalization
of relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is on a six-day official good-will visit to Japan, said
it was former Prime Ministers Kakuei Tanaka and Ohira Masayoshi
who worked with the late Chinese leaders Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai
to realize the normalization of ties. Former Chief Cabinet
Secretary Nikaido Susumu did a lot to help realize the
normalization of China-Japan relations, he added.
</P>
<P>
Also, Li reminded the effort of Mr. Takasaki Tatsunosuke who
helped forge the trade ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Li said it is because "there are many friends who strived for
Sino-Japanese friendship" that bilateral relations have developed
so far.
</P>
<P>
In the future, he went on to say, a younger generation should be
nurtured and educated to carry on the cause of the Sino-Japanese
friendship. He expressed the hope that the old friends and their
relatives can make their contributions in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-eight-year-old Susumu, who participated in the
negotiations between Japan and China on the normalization of ties,
said he will continue to work for Japan-China friendship.
</P>
<P>
Those who were present at the meeting also included former
Chairman of the Komei Party Takeiri Yoshikatsu, and the relatives
of former Prime Minister Masayoshi, former advisor of Japan-China
Association on Economy and Trade Okazaki Kaheita.

<HEADLINE> 5 Cypriot Ministers Sworn in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Five new ministers of the
Cypriot government were sworn in here today to replace the
ministers of the government's former coalition partner, who
resigned last week.
</P>
<P>
The five ministers were George Charalambides, George
Stavrinakis, Andreas Mantovanis, Efstathios Papadakis, Michalakis
Michaelides, who took the portfolio of defense; interior;
agriculture, natural resources and environment; labor and social
insurance; commerce, industry and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Five ministers of the center-right Democratic Party (DIKO)
resigned November 5 from the 11-member cabinet. But the reason for
the withdrawal of the party from the coalition government was not
made explicit.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides, 77, said last week he would
seek re-election in the presidential elections due February 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, 65-year-old Spyros Kyprianou, leader of DIKO and
Speaker of the House of Representative, also had decided to run
for the presidency and said that his party would exit from the
coalition if Clerides wanted to seek a second term.
</P>
<P>
Clerides, founder of the ruling rightwing Democratic Rally,
succeeded in the presidential election in February 1993 with the
support of the DIKO, which has five ministers in the cabinet.

<HEADLINE> France: Measures on Iraq Must Be Decided by UN Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- France today insisted that any
new decision on Iraq must be taken within the framework of the
United Nations Security Council, after the U.N. council adopted a
watered down resolution on Iraq Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret said
that the resolution adopted by the Security Council does not
"predict in any way the use of force" against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The resolution called for the tightening of sanctions on Iraq,
including the banning of travel abroad by some Iraqi leaders, but
dropped a warning of "serious consequences" against Iraq for its
expulsion of Americans from the U.N. inspection team of Iraq's
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
France has expressed several times its opposition to any use of
force against Iraq, while the United States and Britain have
warned Iraq of military actions.
</P>
<P>
"For our part, we estimate that any new measure (against Iraq)
should be taken uniquely in the framework of the (Security)
Council, and should be proportioned" to Iraqi cooperation with the
U.N. over disarmament, said the spokeswoman.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Calls for Timetable to Lift Sanctions on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Jordan today urged the United
Nations Security Council to hammer out a timetable to lift the
sanctions imposed on Iraq since its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Such a timetable was needed to convince the Iraqi leadership
that the sanctions would be lifted when it had complied with the
relevant U.N. resolutions, said Jordanian Foreign Minister Fayez
Tarawneh at a joint press conference with the visiting Canadian
Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh contended that this kind of timetable would help solve
the current crisis between Iraq and the United Sates.
</P>
<P>
Iraq decided on October 29 to expel the U.S. inspectors on the
U.N. weapons inspection teams overseeing the disarmament of Iraq.
And the U.S. had threatened to strike Iraq with force if Iraq took
actions against American inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh said that Jordan opposed tightening the sanctions or
any military actions against Baghdad as they would affect the
Iraqi and Jordanian peoples as well as peace and security in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He called for continuous dialog instead of continuous sanctions
in a bid to solve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy said that Canada would support any decision by the
U.N. Security Council to implement its resolutions and especially
supported the oil-for-food deal which helped the Iraqi people ease
their hardship.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy arrived here today for a short visit.

<HEADLINE> German Central Bank Denies Speculations About Gold Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The German central bank, the
Bundesbank, today denied speculations that it is planning to sell
parts of its gold reserves, but admitted for the first time that
it would lend some of them.
</P>
<P>
In the runup to the 1999 start of the planned single European
currency, the Euro, the sale of the Bundesbank's gold reserve or
only a debate about this issue would be "psychologically
disastrous," said Bundesbank Vice President Johann Wilhelm Gaddum.
</P>
<P>
His remarks were made in reaction to speculations among gold
dealers in London that the Bundesbank was considering to join the
Belgian and Dutch central banks in selling parts of its gold
reserves.
</P>
<P>
The Bundesbank, however, confirmed today for the first time
that like other central banks it was participating in the gold
lending business.
</P>
<P>
But it declined to disclose how much of its 3,700 tons of gold
reserves would be lent, saying only it would only be "a limited
amount" used to help cover the costly holding of the gold
reserves.
</P>
<P>
Some German news reports said that the Bundesbank would
probably lend about 10 percent of the reserves to other central
bank, mining companies as well as jewelry makers.
</P>
<P>
At an average annual rate of 2 percent, the deals would yield
about 70 million U.S. dollars for the bank.
</P>
<P>
German Finance Minister Theo Waigel had proposed earlier this
year to sell parts of Germany's gold reserves to help the country
meet the strict qualification criteria to join the Euro.
</P>
<P>
But the plan was dropped eventually after meeting a storm of
outcries in Europe with critics condemning the move as a financial
trickery which would risk confidence in the Euro.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The German Economics Ministry
said today that Germany's trade with Africa rose in the first
half of this year, with exports up 6.6 percent and imports up
nearly 10 percent compared to the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
German exports to Africa during the period were totaled 8
billion marks (4.7 billion U.S. dollars), while imports from
Africa increased to just over 8 billion marks.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil accounts for some 40 percent of Germany's imports
from Africa. Other main imports are cocoa, coffee, fruits and
gold.
</P>
<P>
South Africa remained Germany's biggest trading partner in
Africa. In the first six months of this year, German exports to
South Africa grew by some 3 percent to 2.8 billion marks while
imports reached 1.7 billion marks, up some 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Libya became Germany's second biggest trading partner thanks to
an 18 percent increase in oil exports, which totaled over 1.5
billion marks. German exports to Libya were up 2.6 percent to
reach 447 million marks during the period.
</P>
<P>
Egypt followed Libya in trade with Germany, with imports from
Germany up 11 percent to 1.3 billion marks but exports to Germany
down 5 percent to 240 million marks.

conference to be held in the Qatari capital Doha on November 16 to

<HEADLINE> Sakurauchi Calls For Enhancement of Sino-Japanese Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Japanese people should firmly
remember the great losses and sufferings China and other Asian
countries experienced due to the war launched by Japan and its
colonial rule, and look forward into the future enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
These remarks were made by Chairman of the Japan Association
for the Promotion of International Trade Yoshio Sakurauchi here
today at a welcome reception held by seven Japan-China Friendship
organizations in honor of visiting Chinese Premier Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
Sakurauchi said a long-term and stable cooperation with China
is indispensable to the sustainable and stable economic
development and cultural prosperity in Japan in such a world as is
witnessing great changes.
</P>
<P>
He said Japan and China took a historic step in the
normalization of their diplomatic ties 25 years ago and their
building of a new kind of friendly relationship thereafter.
</P>
<P>
Six years later, they concluded a treaty of peace and
friendship and promoted, to a significant extent, the exchanges
between the two countries in various areas such as politics,
economy, science and technology as well as culture and sports.
</P>
<P>
He attributed these achievements to the joint efforts of the
politicians and people of the older generation of the two
countries as well as the people present at today's reception.
</P>
<P>
He said the establishment of a firm relationship of mutual
trust between Japan and China and the strengthening of cooperation
between the two peoples in various fields oriented toward the 21st
century are also of vital importance to world peace and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Also at the reception, Chinese Premier Li proposed a five-point
principle governing the development of Sino-Japanese ties.
</P>
<P>
The seven organizations that co-hosted the welcome reception
were the Japan-China Friendship Association, Japan-China Society,
Japan-China Economic and Trade Association, Japan Association for
the Promotion of International Trade, Japan-China Cultural
Exchange Association, the Japanese Dietman's League for
Japan-China Friendship and Japan-China Friendship Center.
</P>
<P>
Present at the reception were more than 1,000 people from
various circles who have worked for the cause of Japan-China
friendship.

The Chinese premier arrived here yesterday afternoon for a
six-day official good-will visit to Japan.

<HEADLINE> Toyota Invited to Set up Assembly Plant in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Japan's automobile giant Toyota
has been invited to establish an assembly plant in Nigeria, the
News Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
The invitation was extended to Toyota Nigeria Limited at the
17th Lagos International Trade Fair by Colonel Mohammed Marwa,
the military administrator of Lagos State.
</P>
<P>
The administrator said such a move will enable Toyota to take
advantage of the huge market in the west Africa sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's automobile market had been dominated, until a few
years ago, by Peugeot cars from France, which has been operating
an assembly plant in Nigeria since 1977.
</P>
<P>
However, Japanese cars have been taking a large share of the
market from Peugeot over the recent years. A proof of this is the
establishment of the Toyota Nigeria Limited in 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to officials from the Peugeot Automobile Nigeria
Limited, the company produced only 4,000 cars in 1996, compared
to 60,000 cars in the best years.
</P>
<P>
The slide of Peugeot's fortune in Nigeria, of course, is more
a result of a sustained economic depression than the competition
of Japanese cars.
</P>
<P>
During the oil boom period in the 1970s, automobile producers
from Britain, Germany, Italy and France all had their assembly
plants in Nigeria. Peugeot is one of the very few that are still
operating.

<HEADLINE> Russian Minister Speaks on Foreign Trade Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Russia's foreign trade volume
decreased in the first quarter of 1997 for the country's
positions in the world market are vulnerable, Russian Minister
for Foreign Economic Relations Mikhail Fradkov said here today.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax, for the first time in the past four
years, Russia's foreign trade turnover in the first half of 1997
decreased by 4 percent on the respective period of 1996, the
minister said at a meeting of the Coordinating Council for Foreign
Trade.
</P>
<P>
Fradkov said exports declined by 2 percent while imports went
down by 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, exports decreased mainly because the situation
on the world market worsened for the export of raw materials, and
these unfavorable changes again confirmed that Russian exports
hinge on three products -- gas, oil and petroleum products --
therefore Russia is vulnerable on foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
Fradkov said that imports have decreased because the investment
activity in the country remains low, the domestic market has been
filled with imported goods and measures of tariff and nontariff
regulation on imports have been tightened in order to protect
domestic producers.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the import indicators in 1997 were lowered
"artificially." "The flow of imports via unregistered channels --
through the `Belarussian corridor' and `shuttle trade' -- has
increased considerably as a result of the complex of protective
and administrative measures taken by Russia at the end of 1996 and
the start of 1997," he added.
</P>
<P>
The pace of decline in exports and imports has slowed in the
second half of the year, Fradkov said.
</P>
<P>
On the prospects for foreign trade next year, he noted, "The
stimulating influence on foreign trade of economic stabilization
in Russia, an increase in its credit rating, the country's
admission into leading international organizations such as the
Paris and London clubs and the agreements on the rescheduling of
Russia's foreign debt."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Fradkov said, "One should not forget that
Russian foreign trade will be impaired further by the low level of
industrial production, insufficient state support for the
development of the country's export potential, weak investment
activity on the domestic market, low competitiveness of national
industrial products and the exhaustion of extensive growth factors
with regard to the export of fuel and other raw materials."

ADDIS ABABA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian farmers
today were urged to gather in their harvest before an untimely
rain expected over the various parts of the country in the coming
ten days.
</P>
<P>
The call came from the National Meteorological Services Agency

The agency said unseasonal rain is expected over the eastern,
central and northern parts of the country, adding that
agricultural experts should take the necessary measures to
protect the already harvested crops from disease and insects.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's grain production this year has been affected by
shortage of rainfall during the main rainy season from June to
September. According to an official announcement made last month,
about 4.6 million people were affected by drought and 420,000
metric tonnes of food is required to feed the victims. The
untimely rain will worsen the situation of food production this

<HEADLINE> US Expects Approval of Resolution Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
today that the U.N. Security Council would pass a strong
resolution against Iraq for its defiance to comply with U.N.
weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
"We are working on the wording and we are satisfied the
Security Council will have a very strong resolution that condemns
action by the government of Iraq and demands a new course of
action that will allow mandated U.N. inspections to go forward,"
White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said a vote on the resolution was expected in the Security
Council later today and now diplomats were consulting on the
phrasing of the resolution.
</P>
<P>
McCurry disclosed that in addition to travel restrictions on
Iraqi officials there were extra measures to be imposed on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"It will also have other restrictions placed on Iraqi officials
and will make clear that if that doesn't work, further measures
are indicated," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe this will be a strong, unanimous statement by the
world community that Iraq needs to comply with relevant Security
Council resolutions," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqis said today that it would not bow to any new
"oppressive" U.N. resolutions imposed on their country and would
continue to bar Americans from taking part in U.N. weapons
inspection teams' work unless inspectors were neutral and a
timetable was set for lifting U.N. sanctions imposed after the
1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
"Even if America is able to gain... a new oppressive resolution
of a vicious international cover to strike against Iraq, it would
not force it to retreat from its decision," Iraq's newspaper
al-Thawra said.
</P>
<P>
Several thousand Iraqis demonstrated in front of a U.N. office
in Baghdad today and more and more Iraqi families shouting "Down
with America!" flocked to the presidential palace, acting as human
shields in case of an attack by the United States on these venues.

<HEADLINE> Talks on S. Leone Ends with Little Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The two-day talks with the
military junta on the restoration of civilian rule in the country
between the west African peacekeeping force (ECOMOG) and the
military junta ended today but disputes over major issues still
remain.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG Force Commander Major-General Victor Malu, who led the
ECOMOG team to the meeting in Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone,
was back at its headquarters in Monrovia, Liberia. He said the
meeting was successful.
</P>
<P>
But the junta said he was making propaganda, the British
Broadcasting Corporation reported.
</P>
<P>
According to Malu, the two sides have agreed on the
disarmament of Sierra Leone's various combatants beginning next
month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the presence of Nigerian soldiers, who constitute
the bulk of the ECOMOG troops, will no longer be objected by the
Sierra Leonean side as before and will be deployed around that
country very soon, Malu said.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed on such major issues as the enforcement of
sanctions against the junta imposed by west African countries and
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"We all agreed on that," Malu said, adding that he was even
looking forward to moving the ECOMOG headquarters to Sierra Leone
from Monrovia, where the Liberian government wants ECOMOG to
leave.
</P>
<P>
But dispute remains over who are the combatants to be disarmed
and the deployment of Nigerian army in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG insists the Sierra Leonean army be disarmed along with
other militias in the country while the junta said the
constitutional army should not be included.
</P>
<P>
Major John Milton, assistant director of information of the
junta's ministry of defense, had another view on the two major
issues, complaining that Malu was providing misinformation and
making hostile propaganda.
</P>
<P>
He said the two parties had not categorily decided which
combatants should be disarmed and insisted that disarmament
should not cover the Sierra Leonean army.
</P>
<P>
"We did not agree on disarmament...and also we did not agree
on the domination of the Nigerian contingent in ECOMOG," he said.
</P>
<P>
The military junta has softpedalled its opposition to the
presence of Nigerian soldiers in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Milton said: "We are not opposed to the Nigerian deployment in
Sierra Leone. What we are opposed to is the dominance of Nigeria
in ECOMOG and also in the pursuance of peace in Sierra Leone."
</P>
<P>
According to him, the junta only wants to see an expanded
ECOMOG with Nigerian involvement, not Nigerian dominance.
</P>
<P>
However, observers noted that Nigeria, as a sub-regional
power, is now the only country in west Africa with human and
material resources for such peacekeeping operations in Sierra
Leone as it did before in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
This will make it natural for Nigeria to dominate ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
Under a peace agreement, the junta is to hand over power to
the civilian government it ousted in the May 25 coup six months
later.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is to search for modalities to implement the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
As views are so different from the two parties, observers
doubted whether the peace plan can be carried out smoothly and
earnestly.

LONDON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
kept on a trend of decline and all ended in the negative today,
depressed by the slide on Wall Street and Asian markets as well as
by concerns on US interest rates.
</P>
<P>
British shares on the London market ended more than 70 points

<HEADLINE> Israel, PNA Near Agreement on Code of Conduct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Israel and the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) are close to formulating a code of
conduct to advance the peace process, visiting Luxemburg Foreign
Minister Jacques Poos said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference after his meeting with Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy, Poos, current rotating President of
the Council of European Union (EU), said that an agreement on
formulating the code of conduct which was proposed by the EU might
be reached in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
The code of conduct, which was proposed by EU foreign
ministers early last month, is aimed at safeguarding all that has
been achieved in the peace process and introducing
confidence-building measures to bolster the fight against
unilateral activities that might damage peace progress.
</P>
<P>
Poos said that as Israel was marking the second anniversary of
the assassination of late prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, he took
the opportunity to urge the Israeli government to follow in
Rabin's path to continue the Oslo process.
</P>
<P>
"Rabin was the initiator of the peace process and I would like
to pay him tributes today. I think it's up to us to continue his
work, because his work will bring security to all and prosperity
to all, if it is well done," he said.
</P>
<P>
Poos also voiced support to the United States' efforts to push
the peace talks forward. "Exactly, the United States and the EU
think alike that the peace process has to continue step by step to
bring about a lasting and just solution for all the peoples in the
region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the auspices of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, Levy and PNA deputy Mahmoud Abbas met in Washington
early this month and agreed to continue sub-committee negotiations
in the region to discuss interim-status issues.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Middle East and North Africa Economic
Conference to be held in Qatar next week, Levy said he has still
not decided whether to attend the meeting, stressing that he
wanted to ensure such trip will be successful.
</P>
<P>
The conference is facing a boycott by most Arab countries led
by regional powers like Egypt and Saudi Arabia due to Israeli
participation.
</P>
<P>
Poos will meet PNA President Yasser Arafat tonight and will
also visit Syria and Lebanon during his Middle East tour.

<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Avivi Pinchas, the visiting
ambassador at the foreign office of Israel told Cameroon Tribune
today that he is optimistic over the middle east peace process,
adding that a concrete agreement for the future will be made.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Cameroon Tribune, ambassador Pinchas
noted that an agreement that will ensure the existence of
Palestinians and Israelis as neighbors is possible.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador reviewed that they are now talking of the
concrete agreement. "We did this with Egypt, the Camp David
Accord and i think we are ready to do the same with the
Palestinian people, " he said.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador noted, "in the north of Israel, we are still
having problems with Lebanon and Syria. We are not saying the
south of Lebanon is part of Israel but we wish to have peace in
the northern part of Israel."
</P>
<P>
"Once Lebanon is able to ensure this peace," he continued,
"Israel will be ready to leave the area. Syria has an opportunity
to make peace with Israel. I am optimistic."
</P>
<P>
"Good neighbors will definately have some divisions. The
problem is to decide where the wall will be. But as regards
health, water supply etc., which require regional cooperation, we
have to work together," he added.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador also highlighted the good relations between
Israel and Cameroon. "Cameroon in the central African region and
Africa as a whole is one of the most friendly countries to
Israel," he said.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that during his visit, he met with Cameroonian
authorities to sample their views, "we have experince in
agro-industry and transport which we are ready to share."
</P>
<P>
The abassador announced that his ministry had decided to
nominate a new highly competent ambassador accredited to Cameroon
who will cover the sub-region in stead of the current charge
d'affair, "so as to improve ties between the two countries."

<HEADLINE> Zambian Government Differs With Opposition on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government differs
with the opposition parties on perception of dialogs, a senior
government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Richard Sakala, presidential aide for press and public
relations, told a news briefing that the government is ready to
have dialogs with the United National Independence Party (UNIP)
led by foremer president Kenneth Kaunda and other opposition
parties but not on the conditions they have set.
</P>
<P>
He said there are various issues such as Zambians' welfare and
Zambia's relations with its neighboring countries and the
international community which could be discussed in the dialogs.
</P>
<P>
Sakala said preconditions such as formation of a government of
national unity and brushing the current constitution aside are
not acceptable.
</P>
<P>
He accused the opposition parties of trying to achieve
privileges through dialgos.
</P>
<P>
The current government is elected by the Zambian people
democratically and therefore is a legitimate government, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sakala also said that Zambia's problems should be settled by
Zambians themselves and not by outsiders.
</P>
<P>
Zambians will build their own country here and not those
abroad, Sakala said.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion minister of energy and water development
Suresh Desai told reporters the political situation in the
country does not warrant the international intervntion.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Zambian leaders have not failed to solve
their own problems.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda is having a marathon trip abroad to lobby the
international community to stop assistance to the Zambian
government.

<P>
ABU DHABI, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister
Kamal Kharrazi arrived in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) this
afternoon for a two-day official visit, UAE's Wam news agency

</P>
<P>
This was part of Kharrazi's tour to the oil-rich Gulf region
in a bid to improve Tehran's relations with its Gulf neighbors, Wam

</P>
<P>
The tour is the Iranian foreign minister's first visit to the

</P>
<P>
Iran has been trying to improve its ties with the Arab world,
in particular with the Gulf Arab countries, since President
Mohammad Khatami formed a new government in August.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi's tour comes one month before the summit of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) due to be hosted by
Iran on December 9-11.
</P>
<P>
Iran feverishly hopes to make the meeting an unprecedented
gathering of foreign dignitaries. Around 50 heads of state,
including the Gulf Arab states, have been invited to the
convention.
</P>
<P>
The UAE, which has a territorial dispute with Iran, is the
fifth leg of Kharrazi's tour which has taken him to Saudi Arabia,

<HEADLINE> All-Lebanon Strike Called for Tomorrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 12 (Xinhua) -- All Lebanese have been called
on to take part in a general strike Thursday to demand payment
increase.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference today, Lebanese General Workers
Confederation (GWC) leader Ghanim Zoghbi demanded all citizens
from fishermen to students to walk out.
</P>
<P>
He said tomorrow is the day on which people can say "no" to the
government's indirect taxes collection, extravagance and waste,
and say "yes" for the workers' and teachers' pay rise demands.
</P>
<P>
The move was taken following the failure of GWC's negotiations
with the government and the associations of bankers,
industrialists and merchants over the demands, which include a
raise of the monthly minimum wage from 200 U.S. dollars to 300.
</P>
<P>
The associations rejected the labor demands and urged
employees to ignore the call for strike. But the union of bank
employees have said all its members will stay away from banks
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The union of fishermen also said yes to the call for strike.
</P>
<P>
Zoghbi said that the strike will not mean the closure of
the door of negotiation, adding that the new round of talks
with the government and associations of employers will start
early next week.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he threatened that if no progress is seen, another
two-day strike will follow on November 25 and 26.

<HEADLINE> US Ready for Strike on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States is ready
with a range of contingency options to make a strike on Iraq when
necessary, but has not decided when to take a military action or
what kind of action will be taken, Pentagon officials said today.
</P>
<P>
"There have been no decisions, no alerts, no deployments
orders," one of the officials said. But he said there is a "list
of options" noting that Washington had in the past quickly sent
radar-avoiding F-117A stealth jets, bombers and troops to the Gulf
area.
</P>
<P>
"We feel we have an adequate force there now," another official
said. He was referring to 17 U.S. warships and 200 warplanes in
the gulf region, mostly in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
They include the aircraft carrier Nimitz and seven ships armed
with long-range tomahawk cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
Another aircraft carrier the George Washington might be sent
from the Mediterranean into the Red Sea or the Gulf in case for
re-enforcement, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, four U.N. F-16 fighter jets and six KC-135 tanker
aircraft have recently been sent to Incirlik Air Base in Turkey,
but Pentagon spokesman Army Lt. Col. Steve Campbell said the
increase in the U.S. air activity at Incirlik was not connected to
the standoff with Baghdad, but was to expand patroling of the
northern no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has vowed to shoot down any U-2 spy planes when they fly
its territorial air, which the Iraqis deem as the invasion of its
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The United States has also vowed to retaliate to Iraq's
attempt.
</P>
<P>
A U-2 resumed reconnaissance flight on an order from the United
Nations Monday after one week's suspension. It faced no challenge
from Iraq's aircraft defense system. And one Pentagon official
said another U-2 flight might be expected "within the next several
days."

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Eyes Kenyan Electricity Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania may sell
electricity to Kenya once the 150 megawatts Songosongo gas-fueled
power project and the 350MW Kihansi hydro-electric power projects
are completed.
</P>
<P>
The Songosongo project and the first phase of the Kihansi
project which has an installed capacity of 180 MW, are slated to
go on line in 1999, today's Financial Times quoted energy experts
as saying.
</P>
<P>
When the two projects are completed, total capacity of the
national power grid of Tanzania will reach 700 MW, compared with
500 MW of demand at present, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
Supply will be in surplus of the national power demand, since
effective consumption stands at 350 MW and is not likely to
exceed 500 MW in two years, Energy Ministry sources said.
</P>
<P>
Samuel Sitta, Director General of the Tanzania Investment
Center, recently mentioned the possiblity of selling power to
Kenya in talks with his Kenyan counterpart, Dr Joseph arap N'gok.
</P>
<P>
Kenya, whose power consumption is steadily growing, imports
about 30 MW of electricty from Uganda at present.

He made the call in a message to the African Parliamentary
Union, the European Parliament and the Association of Southeast

weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Hammadi contended it was the American inspectors that caused
the crisis and problems between Iraq and the U.N..
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the expulsion order was prompted due to the
plots by American inspectors aimed at prolonging the sanctions
imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdul-Meguid today sent a message to Qatar on the league's
stance toward a controversial economic conference the emirate
insists on hosting on November 16-18.
</P>
<P>
But Meguid refused to disclose whether or not the Cairo-based
league will send any delegation to the fourth Middle East and
North Africa Economic Conference to be held in Doha that Israel
will attend.
</P>
<P>
He said that a final word on the league's participation will
not come out until Thursday when he expected Qatari Foreign
Minister Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim Bin Jabir Al-Thani received the
letter.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that he announced in September that the League's
participation in the conference was linked to achieving tangible
progress in the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Without giving sources, the Middle East News Agency said today
that it learned that the Arab League will not participate in the
Doha conference and Meguid will not represent it there.
</P>
<P>
It said the League's stance comes in line with the majority of
Arab countries that have announced their boycott of the
conference, namely, Egypt, Syria, the Palestinian National
Authority, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, the United Arab Emirates,
Lebanon, Sudan, Iraq, Libya and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
So far, in the 16 Arab countries which were invited, only
Jordan, Kuwait, Oman, Yemen and Tunisia have decided to show up.
</P>
<P>
The annual MENA conference, which has been held in Casablanca,
Amman and Cairo, was initiated in 1994 to integrate Israel into
the regional economy.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries have been split over whether or not to
attend the Doha conference as the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks
have ground to a virtual halt and the peace process on the
Lebanese and Syrian tracks have been on ice since 21 months ago.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian negotiating delegation led by its chief
delegate Saeb Erekat today briefed Meguid and Arab ambassadors on
the outcome of the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations in Washington,
which failed to touch the basic issues of the peace process.

UNITED NATIONS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Developed nations
should take concrete actions in support of developing countries'
efforts to eradicate poverty, A Chinese delegate said here today.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qun, Deputy Representative of the Chinese Delegation to
the Second Committee (Financial and Economic) of the U.N. General
Assembly, said the problem of imbalance in development came to the
fore and the number of people subject to poverty continued to
increase as the process of globalization accelerated.
</P>
<P>
The problem of poverty in the developing countries is largely
the result of unfortunate historical experiences and an
unfavorable external economic environment, Wang said, adding that
it is important to strengthen the international development
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Despite a consensus on poverty eradication and action programs,
the international community is lacking determination, political
will and concrete actions to implement such consensus and measures,
he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Delegation appeals to the international community,
developed nations in particular, to take actions to implement
consensus in the core areas of funds, debt, trade and for
developing countries in their efforts to eradicate poverty, Wang
went on.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese Government has attached great importance to
poverty alleviation and the number of people in poverty in China
has dropped to 5.8 million from 250 million as recorded in late
1970s.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council today adopted a resolution, imposing new
sanctions on Iraq against its violations of relevant U.N.
resolutions in weapons inspections in the country.
</P>
<P>
All of the 15 members of the Security Council voted for the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
The resolution demands that Iraq rescind immediately its
October 29 decision to ban Americans from the U.N. Special
Commission in charge of scrapping Iraq's chemical, biological and
missile stocks (UNSCOM). Iraq has repeatedly alleged that the
American inspectors are spies aiming at prolonging the U.N.
sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The resolution demands that Iraq cooperate fully and
immediately, and without conditions or restrictions with the
Special Commission.
</P>
<P>
The resolution decides that U.N. member states shall without
delay prevent the entry into or transit through their territories
of all Iraqi officials and members of the Iraqi armed forces who
were responsible for or participated in the instances of
non-compliance.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution was co-sponsored by the United States,
Britain, Chile, Costa Rica, Japan, Poland, Portugal, Republic of
Korea and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
In a debate prior to the voting, a number of U.N. member states
stressed their positions that the current arms inspection crisis
in Iraq should be resolved through diplomatic consultation instead
of using force or threatening to use force.
</P>
<P>
During their contacts with representatives of some of the
Security Council members, Iraqi officials insisted that Baghdad
would not rescind its order to expel the Americans from the
country unless the members of the U.N Special Commission became
neutral and the United Nations set a timetable for the lifting of
the sanctions on Iraq.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Memorial ceremonies marking
the Hebrew anniversary of the assassination of late Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin were held today through the country.
</P>
<P>
In the presence of his families, the Knesset (Parliament) held
here its special memorial session this afternoon for Rabin, who
was felled by a right-wing Jewish gunman at a peace rally on
November 4, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The meeting opened with a minute of silence and was addressed
by President Ezer Weizman, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
opposition Labor Party Chairman Ehud Barak and other senior
officials.
</P>
<P>
Weizman spoke of the legacy of Rabin as a solider and a
statesman. He said both Rabin was a victim of polemics of the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to early reports, the Labor Knesset members remained
in the chamber to hear Netanyahu's speech. Labor reportedly has
said that it would boycott the special session if the prime
minister refused to apology for his inciting remarking that
preceded Rabin's murder.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu stressed the need for soul searching in the wake of
the assassination, saying that "all of us, including me, must
consider past actions and think ways to heal the terrible rift in
the nation."
</P>
<P>
Also in a Likud convention Sunday, Netanyahu called for
national unity and praised the achievements of Labor movement
and other Left movements in the building of the country.
</P>
<P>
But opposition leader Barak said today that he is anxious for
national reconciliation, noting that "reconciliation is not just
words. We must all promise never again to match in perception with
symbol of death and violence and must never again with the words

and political allies and even rivals joined the family of
the slain late prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The half-hour ceremony began with lightening of an eternal
flame by Rabin's grandson Michael El. In place of government and
opposition leaders, former supreme court chief Meir Shargal, who
had led the probe into the Rabin's death, was the only public
figure to address the crowd.
</P>
<P>
He said that the nation had to learn lessons from the
tragic.

<P>
A dozen of wreaths were laid on the Rabin's tomb, and the
first two were placed by Weizman and Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
At Rabin Square in Tel Aviv, the very site of his murder two
years ago, some ten thousands of high school students gathered at
noon today to remember the slain leader.
</P>
<P>
In the gathering, Chief of Staff Amnon Shahak in the name of
Israel Defense Forces saluted Rabin, who had been Chief of Staff
and gained the Israeli greatest victory in the six-day war before
becoming prime minister and defense minister.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in honor of Rabin's assassination, flags through
the country flew at half-mast. And the entire school day was
devoted to his memory, and memorial ceremonies were also held
at all schools.

<P>
TEHRAN, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Iran's free trade zones (FTZ)
so far have absorbed about 250 million U.S. dollars of foreign
investment, a senior Iranian official announced here today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Iranian official news agency IRNA,
Morteza Alviri, advisor to the Iranian president and secretary of
the High Council of Free Trade Zones, said that negotiations were
underway for 5 billion dollars investments in the FTZs.
</P>
<P>
He said that an agreement would soon be signed with India to
build a chemical fertilizer plant at an estimated cost of 330
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Alviri noted that the recent ratification of monetary
policies to govern activities in the FTZs and establishment of
infrastructure there have spurred the recent negotiations to
attract new investments in the areas.
</P>
<P>
So far, Iran has received 2,200 applications for investment in
the FTZs, the Iranian official said, adding that the investments
have led to the establishment of 220 industrial units.
</P>
<P>
Alviri said that China, Japan, the United Arab Emirates,
India, Austria, South Korea, the Czech Republic, Lebanon,
Pakistan, Britian and Kuwait have invested in Iran's free trade
zones.
</P>
<P>
As to the recently approval of the Iranian cabinet to
transform the Bandar Rajaie port to a special trade zone, he said
that it was a major step to facilitate transfer of goods to and
from the Central Asian republics.
</P>
<P>
Alviri said the port's capacity for storage of goods would
increase to 40 million tonnes from the present level of 18 million
tonnes and the volume of goods transported via railway to Iran's
southern port of Bandar Abass would also increase, reaching 10
million tonnes in the future.
</P>
<P>
Iran has established several free trade zones to boost the
country's economy by attracting foreign investment, the most
important ones are the Qeshm Island, Kish Island in the Persian
Gulf and the Chabahar Port on the Oman Sea.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 12 (Xinhua) -- South African National
Assembly Speaker Frene Ginwala said today that bilateral
relations between her country and China would enter a brand-new
era after the establishment of diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with head of a Chinese delegation in Cape Town,
she said she was pleased to see the two countries have signed a
series of contracts and trade and investment protocols during the
visit of the mission.
</P>
<P>
She hoped that the two countries could build up even closer
relations.
</P>
<P>
The speaker said she is looking forward to an official visit
to China after the normalization of relations.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela declared last November
that his country would sever ties with Taiwan and recognize the
People's Republic of China diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Chinese trade and economic delegation, Shi
Guangsheng, said the establishment of diplomatic relations will
provide guarantee and good conditions for trade and economic
cooperation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Shi, who is deputy minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation, believed that bilateral trade and economic relations
will develop more quickly, thus contributing to the economic
development of the two countries and the improvement of the
living standards of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
The 100-strong Chinese delegation, composed of government
officials in charge of trade and economic affairs and
representatives of more than 50 leading Chinese firms, is the
largest ever Chinese mission to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, businesses of the two countries signed 18 contracts
and protocols in Johannesburg totaling 540 million U.S. Dollars.

<HEADLINE> Sudan: Progress in Peace With Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Sudan said today that the
negotiation between the government and the outlawed Sudan People's
Liberation Movement (SPLA) had made progress by agreeing to give
the south the right of self-determination.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters upon return to the Khartoum airport from
Nairobi, Sudanese Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Osman Mohamed
Taha said the government and the largest rebel group in southern
Sudan also agreed to settle conflicts between them through
peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that the government had rejected SPLA's demands to
set up a confederation between north and south, insisting on
maintaining the federal system in place.
</P>
<P>
The government and the SPLA, led by John Garang, held
negotiations from October 29 to November 7 in Kenyan capital
Nairobi to seek ways to end the 14-year old civil war. The two
parties are scheduled resume talks in April.
</P>
<P>
The SPLA has been fighting the Islamic government since 1983 to
press for an increased autonomy for the southern third of Sudan
dominated by Africans, Christians and animists.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 1.3 million people have died either in the
fighting or famine in this African largest country.

<HEADLINE> British PM Promises to Reform Party Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair promised today to reform party funding in the country,
saying it was "long overdue."
</P>
<P>
While answering questions in the parliament, Blair said he had
asked the Committee on Standards in Public Life, a watchdog body,
to examine the whole issue of political funding and report back by
next Summer.
</P>
<P>
His move was taken after the opposition Conservative party
accused the government of breaking promises by allowing tobacco
sponsorship exemption for Formula One.
</P>
<P>
Opposition leader William Hague said today the government was
"breaking them for free all the time," including those on
pensions, tax and cold weather payments.
</P>
<P>
The government has suffered a rough ride from the media over a
controversial donation of one million pounds from millionaire
Bernie Ecclestone, president of Formula One Constructors
Association.
</P>
<P>
The government decided last week to scrap a proposed ban on
tobacco industry sponsorship of Formula One, citing the threat to
British jobs and the possibility the motor racing industry might
move abroad.
</P>
<P>
Blair said there was a collective Cabinet decision made last
week to seek a specific exemption for Formula One and then seek a
worldwide voluntary agreement to avoid Grands Prix in other
countries being shown here without restriction.
</P>
<P>
Such a ban would force Formula One to quit Britain and this
would "affect 8,000 jobs in the motor racing directly and many
more indirectly," he added.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also reaffirmed that the government would
speed up separate legislation to register political parties, ban
foreign donations and require publication of the names of donors
of more than 5,000 pounds (8,510 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The government has promised early this week to pay back
Ecclestone's donation, which was donated before the May 1
election, on advice from Sir Patrick Neill, chairman of the
Standards Committee.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Federal Reserve Decide to Maintain Current </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve
decided today to leave short-term interest rates unchanged despite
some people's concern that the robust economic growth could soon
stimulate inflation.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. central bank said it had concluded a three-hour,
10-minute closed-door meeting of its policy-making Federal Open
Market Committee and had nothing more to say.
</P>
<P>
The committee's statement indicated it has left the benchmark
rate on overnight loans between banks unchanged at 5.5 percent. An
increase would have raised borrowing costs for millions of
American consumers and businesses.
</P>
<P>
The decision to maintain rates steady was widely expected, in
view of the recent tumult in the U.S. stock markets over the past
three weeks in reaction to currency crises in some Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
Before the turbulence, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan had been
warning that a developing labor shortage had put the economy on an
"unsustainable track."
</P>
<P>
Economic experts believed that U.S. Fed policy-makers were
confronted with conflicting economic trends.
</P>
<P>
On one hand, the lowest unemployment rate in 24 years and the
fastest wage gains in eight years suggested they ought to raise
rates to keep inflation contained. But on the other hand, the
tumultuous stock market, gyrating at each new development in Asia,
argued for caution.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts believed the central bankers probably were
looking ahead to when they can raise rates in a calmer financial
atmosphere.

<HEADLINE> US Tells Iraq: Not to Down Spy Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 12 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. military commander
today warned Iraq against firing at U.S. U-2 spy planes flying
over Iraq on U.N. arms inspection mission, saying Baghdad would be
"stupid" if it makes such attacks.
</P>
<P>
General A.K. Richardson, commander of the Nimitz, which was
deployed in the Gulf waters a month ago told reporters on board
the aircraft carrier that any attack on the spy planes would
cause U.S. retaliation.
</P>
<P>
"The carrier is ready to face the worst possibilities and
American pilots have absolute rights to protect themselves when
they come across danger," the Bahraini News Agency quoted the
general as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Baghdad would be stupid if it makes the choice (of attacking
U-2s)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Richardson pointed that his carrier is watching the situation
very closely and he believed Nimitz has "full capabilities of
protecting U-2 spy planes and foiled any attempt to shoot down the
planes."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. general made the remarks after Baghdad threatened to
attack the U-2 spy planes.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said earlier that anti-aircraft systems were on alert to
shoot down "any hostile target."
</P>
<P>
Baghdad's threat came with an order to deport U.S. arms
inspectors in charge of espionage. The order has sparked a crisis
between the U.N. and Iraq.

WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- U. S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said on Wednesday that the United States
would keep pressure on Iraq for "as long as it takes."
</P>
<P>
"To those who ask how long our determination will last, how
long we will oppose Iraqi arrogance, how long we will insist that
the international community's standards be met, our answer is --
as long as it takes," Albright said at the Joint Armed Forces
Officers' Wives League.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday unanimously approved a
resolution condemning Iraq for obstructing U.N. inspectors from
monitoring and destroying Baghdad's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also banned some Iraqi officials from
traveling outside the country.
</P>
<P>
Albright made the United States position as follows: Iraq
must meet its obligations to comply with U.N. weapons check
resolutions. "Our resolve on this issue is unwavering," she
said.
</P>
<P>
"We will not allow Iraq to regain by stonewalling U.N.
inspectors what it forfeited by aggression on the battlefield,"
the secretary stressed.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Athletes Enhance Performance With Hard Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, November 13 (Xinhua) -- An official for doping
control said here on Thursday that the striking perfromance of
Chinese athletes at the recently-ended Eighth National Games were
enhanced by incredible hard training.
</P>
<P>
Nils Lindstedt, Chief Representative of the International
Doping Tests and Management at China, told Sweden Daily which
published Thursday that the Chinese distance runners utilized a
Spartan way in training, which was too hard for western athletes to
bear.
</P>
<P>
What the Swede indicated was the women runners from Liaoning
Province coached by Ma Junren, who pressed his proteges to run one
and a half marathons a day.
</P>
<P>
Ma's protege Jiang Bo broke the women's 5,000 meters record in
the finals on October 23 with 14 minutes 28.09 seconds, beating
the previous world mark of 14:31.27, which had been established by
teammate Dong Yanmei in the heats just two days before.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, 20, also won the 1,500m gold in 3:50.98, only 0.52
second short of the world mark, which was set by Ma's another
deciple Qu Yunxia in Beijing four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Lindstedt added the other factor that Chinese athletes achieved
remarkable results in the Games was that govenments at all levels
across China attached great importance to sports development.
</P>
<P>
Lindstedt, 34, has occassionally conducted out-of-competition
random doping tests on Chinese athletes at the request of IAAF and
FINA since he took the post three years ago.
</P>
<P>
He usually mailed the urine samples for test to the
International Olympic Committee (IOC)-designated laboratories in
Barcelona, London or Cologne, Germany.
</P>
<P>
Lindstedt has taken away the urine samples of some top swimmers
and runners during the Eighth National Games including those of
Jiang Bo.

HONG KONG, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland held an economic
forum here today to promote its trade relations with Hong Kong
and its own image as a European partner for Asia.
</P>
<P>
Rolf Bodenmuller, consul-general of Switzerland in Hong Kong,

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- A European Union (EU)
official today announced that the European Commission, the EU's
executive agency, would support a total of 59 projects aimed at
assisting the integration of refugees in member states.
</P>
<P>
Padraig Flynn, EU commissioner responsible for employment and
social affairs, said the projects concern education and training,
labor market integration, housing, guidance and counseling, access
to services, social protection, culture and leisure activities.

has been able to support -- for the first time -- the social and
economic integration of refugees in member states," said Flynn.
</P>
<P>
He said that "a very large number of interesting projects" had
been submitted despite a tight implementation schedule and high
eligibility standards.

<P>
"I am impressed with the overall quality and scope of the
projects submitted and, in particular, those we have been able to
select for funding," the commissioner said.
</P>
<P>
The selected projects were reportedly submitted by private or
public bodies and organizations at local, regional, national and
European levels. Some funding has been made available for projects
at the European level.

<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The China National Narcotics
Control Commission and the State Education Commission recently
issued a circular, calling for education about
drugs among students in primary and middle schools and
institutions of higher learning.
</P>
<P>
The circular pointed out that the anti-drug move is a serious
matter related to social stability and the future of the country,
and that halting the emergence of new drug addicts is a major task
listed in the country's Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
To provide education about drugs among students and to keep them
away from drugs is an extremely important work that will help prevent

<HEADLINE> Iraq Wants to Work With UNSCOM Without Americans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Iraq reaffirmed it would
continue to cooperate with the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) if
American inspectors were excluded, the Iraqi News Agency (INA)
reported today.
</P>
<P>
This was included in a message sent by Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf to the United Nations Security Council
president, according to INA.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf said in the message that ever since UNSCOM resumed
its work on November 3, it has been informed by Iraq that no
Americans should exercise inspection, but the other members of the
inspection teams were free to carry out their missions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq decided on October 29 to expel the Americans working on
the U.N. weapons inspection teams, and has since barred American
inspector from entering suspected sites along with the U.N. teams.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM must verify that Iraq has eliminated all its long-range
missiles and nuclear, chemical and biological weapons before the
U.N. Security Council can decide to lift the crippling sanctions
imposed on Iraq since its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Yugoslav Presidents Hold Talks in Beijing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, meeting in Beijing this
afternoon, agreed that China and Yugoslavia should develop
friendly relations of long-term, stable and comprehensive
cooperation, and bring peace and prosperity in Asia and Europe to
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders discussed bilateral ties and the regional and
international situation and said they are satisfied with bilateral
co-operation in politics, the economy, culture, and education in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
This is Milosevic's first official visit to China. Jiang said
he believes it will bring Sino-Yugoslav friendly ties to a new
period of development, and that although the two are far from each
other, their similar historical experiences and common aspirations
for peace and development bring them closer.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the two peoples are making unremitting efforts to
improve themselves, pursue a spirit of independence and
self-reliance, and stick to the development road they've chosen
for themselves.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Yugoslav traditional friendship has stood the test of
time, Jiang said, and on many major issues, the two understand and
support each other, and China regards Yugoslavia as an important
and friendly partner in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
He held that the Chinese government will continue to support
Yugoslavia's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity,
and respect the policies the Yugoslav people have chosen.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he appreciates Yugoslavia's "One China" policy and
its refusal to have any official contact or ties with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic said that, although the two nations are far from each
other, their political relations are close, and that he believes
his talks with Jiang will serve to further consolidate bilateral
friendship and open up a new period of friendly co-operation.

<P>
Jiang said that, after the Cold War, rapidly developing
multipolarization has become a historical trend and that various
types of regional co-operation are without precedent, and the
strength of developing countries has increased.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the development of multipolarization is conducive
to world peace, stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Each nation has chosen or is exploring a development road fit
to its own national situation, its own history, and its
traditions, he said, and this should be respected. All countries
should seek common ground while preserving their differences, and
coexist in peace.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic said that the integration process is increasing in
the world and that power politics attempts to affect this, so it
is even more important for countries to increase
co-operation. "Sino-Yugoslav co-operation can be called a good
example," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that, under Milosevic's leadership, the Yugoslav
people, in the complex and changeable Balkan situation, have made
unremitting efforts to have social stability, develop the economy,
and improve the living standard, and have made satisfactory
results.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese believe that, although ethnic groups differ, Jiang
said, they should be on equal footing. "As long as nationalities
live in peace and harmony, the country's unity, development and
prosperity can be secured."
</P>
<P>
Prior to the talks, Jiang presided over a ceremony to welcome
Milosevic and his entourage including Srdja Bozovic, chairman of
the Chamber of Republics of Federal Assembly, and Nikola Sainovic,
deputy prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Present at the welcoming ceremony were Vice-Premier Jiang
Chunyun, Vice-Chairman Wang Bingqian of the National People's
Congress Standing Committee, Vice-Chairman Yang Rudai of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, and Wu Jichuan, chairman of the Chinese Government
reception committee and minister of Post and Telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Jiang and Milosevic signed a joint statement
on promoting friendly co-operative relations between the two
nations.
</P>
<P>
In the evening, Jiang hosted a banquet in honor of the
distinguished Yugoslav visitors.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Japanese Relations Have Broad Prospects, Li Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Li Peng
said here today that Sino-Japanese relations have good prospects
if Japan continues to develop along the path of peace.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with NHK of Japan, Li said China and Japan
should increase contacts, deepen mutual understanding and
strengthen cooperation.
</P>
<P>
As neighbors, China and Japan share similar interests in
security issues, and the two economies are highly complementary,
Li said. Japan is China's largest trading partner.
</P>
<P>
In the 50 years after World War II, Li said, Japan has
developed along a path of peace. And the development of
Sino-Japanese relations depends on what path Japan will take in
the future.
</P>
<P>
As the 21st century approaches, Li said, the leaders and
peoples of the two countries should consider what kind of
relations should be carried into the new century.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on his talks with Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto during his ongoing visit, Li said the talks were
held in a "warm and sincere atmosphere," increasing mutual
understanding and expanding common ground.
</P>
<P>
Li said the talks have covered a wide range of topics,
including bilateral relations and international issues.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Japan are important countries in the world and
in particular in the Asia-Pacific region, Li said. Therefore,
friendly cooperation between the two countries is of crucial
importance to international peace and development, he added.
</P>
<P>
Li said he and Hashimoto agreed that frequent contacts and
direct dialogues between the Chinese and Japanese leaders play a
positive role in increasing mutual understanding between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Referring to disputes between China and Japan resulting from
Japan-U.S. security cooperation guidelines, Li said Hashimoto
explained the issue to him in three points:
</P>
<P>
-- Japan-U.S. security cooperation is in conformity with
Japan's constitution;
</P>
<P>
-- The cooperation is of a defensive nature;
</P>
<P>
-- The cooperation does not run counter to the purpose of the
Japan-China Joint Statement and the Japan-China Treaty of Peace
and Friendship. The Japanese government sticks to the "one China"
position and recognizes the government of the People's Republic of
China as the sole legal government representing all of China.
</P>
<P>
Li said: "It would be perfect if Prime Minister Hashimoto would
add one point, clarifying that Japan-U.S. security cooperation
does not include Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the recent China-U.S. summit and the
China-Russia summit and the talks between Chinese and Japanese
prime ministers, Li said that normal friendly relations and
cooperation among different countries should be maintained after
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
The development of relations between these countries should be
constructive and the framework of any bilateral relations should
not target a third country, Li added.
</P>
<P>
The development of such state-to-state relations is conducive
to peace and development in the Asia-Pacific region and the world
as a whole, and is in the trend of multipolarization, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the human rights issue would become an obstacle to the
development of Sino-U.S. relations, Li said it is natural that
differences exist on this issue since China and the United States
have different national conditions, social systems, ideologies,
values, cultural traditions and different levels of economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Differences can be narrowed and common grounds can be expanded
through dialogues, Li said, adding that the human rights issues
should not be used as a pretext for interfering in other country's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
When asked to give China's position on Russia's request to join
the APEC, the premier said China takes a positive attitude on this
matter since Russia is located across the European and Asian
continents.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the situation on the Korean Peninsula, Li said
China hopes to see peace and stability in that area.
</P>
<P>
The four-party talks on the Korean Peninsula issue are
proceeding and China is ready to play a constructive role in the
issue, he added.
</P>
<P>
The premier stressed that it is only when a new peace mechanism
is established through dialogues and negotiations can peace and
stability on the Korean Peninsula be ensured.
</P>
<P>
He hoped Japan would take more initiative measures to develop
relations with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
On China's domestic situation, Li said the 15th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) recognized Deng
Xiaoping's Theory as the guidelines of China's work in all areas.
</P>
<P>
The CPC congress also elected the new leadership, with
President Jiang Zemin at the core, thus offering a guarantee for
China's stability and development in the future, he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China will continue to implement its policies of
reform and opening up to the outside world.

</P>
<P>
Close to 100 law experts from Britain, Belgium, France,
Germany, Italy, Austria, Spain, Switzerland, the Netherlands,
Denmark, Finland and China gathered to discuss the "role of rule
by law in economic development".
</P>
<P>
Ren Jianxin, President of the Supreme People's Court of China,
said at the opening ceremony that countries and nationalities have
their own historical and cultural traditions and democratic and
legal systems, and therefore they should respect, learn from, and
help each other.
</P>
<P>
Ren said that China needs to understand the legal systems of
the EU countries, because they are all advanced countries where
market economy has developed for more than 200 years and where
legal systems for market economy are relatively mature.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is the world's largest developing country,
with a long history and a large population, and it has made great
headway in democratic and legal development since the founding of
the People's Republic in 1949, and especially since the
implementation of the reform and opening-up policy in 1978.
</P>
<P>
China now has a socialist legal framework which is based on the
Constitution and which contains a series of important laws, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that it is in the interests of China and the EU
countries to increase cooperation in the law and to learn from
each other.
</P>
<P>
He urged both China and the EU countries to respect each other,
safeguard friendship, increase understanding and cooperation in
the law, and put aside political, economic and social
differences.
</P>
<P>
The symposium was sponsored by the China Law Society, the
Sino-British Culture Association, and the Sino-Belgian Economic
and Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
Present at the opening ceremony were Chinese Minister of
Justice Xiao Yang, executive vice-president of the China Law

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- Four Americans and their Pakistani driver were shot and
killed as they drove through Karachi's central business district.
The assailants fled, but police officials suspected they were
avenging the conviction of a Pakistani citizen this week for
killing two CIA employees in Virginian in 1993.
</P>
<P>
-- The U.N. Security Council voted unanimously to impose new
sanctions on Iraq for failing to cooperate with a United Nations
disarmament commission. The sanctions included a ban on foreign
travel by Iraqi officials, but Baghdad said it would ignore the
ban and again barred a team of inspectors from entering sites they
wanted to investigate.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, an electrical engineer who prosecutors
said masterminded the World Trade Center bombing because he
"wanted to make Americans feel terror," was found guilty Wednesday
of conspiracy in the 1993 bombing and faces life in prison.
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton and Vice President Gore gave separate
interviews Tuesday afternoon to Justice Department officials
probing whether either man may have broken the law by making
telephone fund-raising solicitations from the White House.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- The Energy Department predicted a sharp drop in coal and
electricity prices will increase power use and make it harder to
meet Clinton's proposed emissions targets to fight global warming.
The survey projects 2010 carbon-dioxide emissions will be 34
percent higher than in 1990.
</P>
<P>
-- Westinghouse is close to selling its conventional
power-generation business to Germany's Siemens for about 1.5
billion dollars, plus debt assumption, people familiar with the
matter said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kodak's job cuts appear to total 8,000 or even fewer,
rather than the 10,000 announced by the imaging concern, because
some of the cuts involve employees moving to joint ventures.

</P>
<P>
The assistance is aimed to sustain the economic reform course
of Ukraine and alleviate its social costs.
</P>
<P>
The loan, initiated by Yves-Thibault de Silguy, EU commissioner
responsible for economic, monetary and financial affairs, will be
made available subject to a review of Ukraine's economic
performance for 1997-1998.
</P>
<P>
The program is also supported by the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank, said the commission, an executive body of
the European Union (UN).
</P>
<P>
Total assistance provided to Ukraine by the EU and EU member
states has amounted to 4.02 billion ECUs (about 4.60 billion
dollars) since 1991, exceeding the aid of any other donor.
</P>
<P>
The Commission noted that the transition process in Ukraine has
been accelerated following the election of President Leonid Kuchma
in 1994 and considerable progress has been achieved since,
especially in stabilization and liberalization of the economy.
</P>
<P>
But the economic situation remains difficult in the country,
with its GDP declining by another 10 percent in 1996 to stay at
approximately one third of the 1990 level.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Compensate Bomb-Affected Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
decided to give 1.5 billion rupees (25.4 million U.S. dollars) in
compensation to companies which suffered severe property losses in
a bomb blast in the capital on October 15.
</P>
<P>
The compensation package proposed by President Chandrika
Kumaratunga was approved at a special cabinet meeting Wednesday
night, Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said today.
</P>
<P>
The move is to maintain the status of the Fort area, the
business center in Colombo and the site of the blast, as the
country's financial hub, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The landmarks of the Galadari Hotel, the Hilton, the World
Trade Center and the Bank of Ceylon in the area sustained heavy
damages in the blast.
</P>
<P>
Samaraweera said the government made the decision because
insurance covers for the damaged buildings were not enough for the
operators to carry out rehabilitation work.
</P>
<P>
Estimated damages to the World Trade Center and the Hilton
stood at 700 million rupees (11.9 million dollars) and 600 million
rupees (10.2 million dollars) respectively, while the insurance
available for them was only 180 million rupees (3.05 million
dollars) and 12 million rupees (0.2 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Samaraweera said the government will also provide a 15-year
loan to the affected companies with an annual interest rate of 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
He said that other companies which had property losses in
previous terrorist bomb blasts in 1996 will also be compensated.

NEW DELHI, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Inder
Kumar Gujral has called for more attention to women's education,
saying that it would be the key to the progress and development of
countries like India, local press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating a three-day world conference on education in India
on Wednesday, Gujral emphasized the need for changing the mindset
of the society on women's education.
</P>
<P>
He said the drive for literacy among women, which was lagging
behind men because of social obstacles and old-fashioned values,
needed to be intensified.
</P>
<P>
"We must remove and fight against those social obstacles which
inhibit the progress of women. There are social mindsets which
come in the way of women's education," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called for more attention to women's education, especially
primary education and literacy.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need for launching a people's movement to
tackle the problem of illiteracy which he said was one of the
major obstacles to India's progress and development.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- U.N. peace keeping force in
Angola has condemned Angola's former rebel movement UNITA for
beating up one of its peace keepers, according to Angolan News
Agency today.
</P>
<P>
Zambian soldier Warner Chinder, who serves at U.N. peace
keeping force at Jamba in Angola's southeastern province of
Kuandokubango responsible for the disbandment of the ex-soldiers
of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA), was seriously wounded after eight UNITA army men
suddenly attacked him Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chinder was rushed to a nearby hospital for treatment.
</P>
<P>
One official from the World Food Program and his assistant
were also beaten on the occasion. But they were not seriously
wounded.
</P>
<P>
David Wimhurst, spokesman for the U.N. observation team in
Angola, said it is unbearable to see peace keepers here being
beaten up, and that such things should never happen again.
</P>
<P>
He said U.N. special representative Blondin Beye has sent a
message to report the event to UNITA Chairman Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said none of the projects outlined in the peace
process such as the restructuring of state institutes in
UNITA-held areas and the disbandment of its soldiers has been
accomplished since October 30 when the U.N. Security Council
imposed sanctions agains UNITA.

<P>
According to a press conference here on Thursday, the August

<P>
"We will face a more competitive season. What we should do is
to try our best to win every single game," he said at the press
conference.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Wang Zhizhi, who had the most blocks last

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Defense Minister Chi
Haotian said here today that the good-neighborly relations between
China and Thailand are an example of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Chi made the remarks while meeting with Chettha Thanajaro,
Commander-in-Chief of the Thai army,
</P>
<P>
Chi said that, in spite of dramatic changes in the
international situation and in government leaders, the two
countries have always supported each other and cooperated, thus
guaranteeing the friendly cooperative relations for the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
Chi said that Chettha's visit is part of the exchange of visits
by officers of the two armed forces and will promote friendly
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
China is the biggest developing country in the world and
Thailand is a nation with significant influence in southeast Asia,
he noted, so bilateral relations are in the basic interest of the
two peoples and benefit peace and stability in the Asian-Pacific
region and the world.
</P>
<P>
Chettha said that the two countries and the two armed forces have
an extraordinary relationship and expressed his gratitude to the
government and armed forces of China for assisting the Thai
government and armed forces.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Paper Shut Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The military government in
Sierra Leone today ''temporarily suspended'' the thrice weekly
Standard Times newspaper from further publication, state radio
said.
</P>
<P>
A government statement was quoted as charging that the paper
''is formenting strife between friendly neighboring countries
through the use of fictitious stories.''
</P>
<P>
The paper in its Wednesday edition claimed that Liberian
President Charles Taylor and the military rulers in Sierra Leone
were assisting the son of late Guinean leader Sekou Toure to
"invade Guinea and overthrow the government of Lansana Conte."
</P>
<P>
''This is a vicious piece of propaganda that exists within the
mentality of the editor and the paper,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the recent discovery of arms in parts of
Sierra Leone were meant to be used in the operations.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said the Standard Times has been one of the
foremost critics of the military government since it took power
in May and has continued to advocate for an ECOMOG military
intervention in Sierra Leone to wrestle power from the junta.
</P>
<P>
However, the paper's editor, Abdul Sesay defended himself by
telling xinhua, ''we are surprised over this development as we
were undertaking normal news coverage.''

NAIROBI, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Kenya has failed to maintain
its annual 15 to 20 percent increase of horticultural exports due
to adverse weather conditions early this year.
</P>
<P>
The country exported 62.1 million kilograms of fresh
vegetables, fruits and cut flowers in the first nine months this
year, up only 1.1 percent from 61.4 million kilograms in the same

<P>
The fresh exports reached 54.4 million and 40.1 million
kilograms in the first nine months of 1995 and 1994 respectively.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that exporters who sold sub-standard produce
like immature fruit to capitalize on short term demand overseas
just ended up denting the country's image in Europe last year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> IMF Welcomes Efforts to Set up Asian Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 13 (Xinhua) -- International Monetary
Fund (IMF) Managing Director Michel Camdessus said today the IMF
welcomed efforts including the setting up of a proposed Asian Fund
to help prevent and react to a financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a press conference after meeting
Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim here today.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Camdessus was asked to comment on
whether the IMF will allow a separate Asian Fund being proposed by
some countries to have slightly differing conditionalities from
IMF programs to reflect the social diversity in the ASEAN
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations) region.
</P>
<P>
He said the setting up of Asian Fund was an extremely good idea
for countries to take extra efforts to help prevent and react to a
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that while financial instruments were
not lacking in tackling the currency crisis in ASEAN, what was
lacking was a regional surveillance of each other's impending
financing crisis.
</P>
<P>
There is "unanimity among Asian countries in this region to
avoid creating whatever soft conditionalities for programs because
it was important for markets to rectify this kind of programs," he
said, adding that otherwise, "you would have spent the money and
increase the indebtedness without establishing confidence in the
market."
</P>
<P>
On the IMF's study on controls of currency trading as proposed
by Malaysia, he said preliminary findings would be revealed at an
ASEAN finance ministers' meeting scheduled for December 1-2 here.
</P>
<P>
He said the full findings of the study, which will include
lessons to be learnt from the recent monetary and financial crisis
affecting several developing countries, will be presented to the
IMF Board and the international community either by the end of
January or early February next year.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus said Malaysia's tradition of building on long term
macroeconomic stability and prudent financial management would
allow it to cope with the current problems.
</P>
<P>
He praised Malaysia for implementing measures to further
strengthen and consolidate its financial sector, saying the steps
taken in the 1998 Budget such as calling for greater disclosure
and regulatory moves in the finance sector including increasing
the provisions for bad loans and cuts in loan growth "would allow
Malaysia to resist this turmoil."
</P>
<P>
Camdessus said the IMF felt reassured by Malaysia's commitment
to curbing credit expansion and steps taken to overcome the
current account deficit by deferring large projects and reducing
imports.
</P>
<P>
He said the prudential regulations and transparency being
pushed by the Malaysian government and moves towards greater
disclosures would place the country in a better position to handle
the financial crisis plaguing regional economies.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Doctor Sentenced to Death for Aiding Bus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian Higher Military
Court today sentenced a mental hospital director to life
imprisonment for his misconduct of freeing his patient who
attacked a German tourist bus in downtown Cairo on September 18.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Nessim Abdel Malek Nessim was found guilty for freeing
Saber Farahat from his Cairo's Khanka Asylum where Farahat stayed
under the pretext of mental treatment before being set free to
carry out the fatal attack that killed nine German tourist and
their Egyptian driver, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Sayed el-Qut, director general of mental health at the
Health Ministry, standing trial on bribery charges, was acquited.
</P>
<P>
Of other suspects including patients, physicians and orderlies
implicated in the case, eight were sentenced to prison terms
ranging between three to ten years while two others were acquited.
</P>
<P>
Saber was confined to Khanka Asylum when he was proved
insane in the wake of the 1993 killings of three foreigners at
Cairo's Semiramis Hotel.
</P>
<P>
He has told reporters that his family bribed Sayed el-Qut to
set him free before last month's attack on the German tourists.
</P>
<P>
The Farahat brothers were sentenced to death and hanged last
week on conviction of premeditated murder and the use of violence
to harm the Egyptian economy.
</P>
<P>
Six co-defendants got various prison terms ranging between
three to ten years with hard labor for supplying them with
ammunition and weapons used in the tourist bus shooting and
fire bomb attack.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-six other people were wounded in the fatal attack
outside the Egyptian Museum, which houses some of the world's
greatest Pharaonic treasures.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian authorities have denied that the attack was
carried out by Islamic militants fighting Mubarak's government
since 1992, and described it as an isolated case carried out by a
lunatic.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary
General Esmat Abdul Meguid said here today that the league will
not attend the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) Economic
Conference to be opened Sunday in Doha, Qatar.
</P>
<P>
Meguid told reporters that he will not take part in the
three-day gathering nor will the league send any delegation there
due to no tangible progress in the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the decision was in line with the
resolution adopted on September 20 at the League's Council that
linked its participation in the conference to achieving progress
in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Arab League chief sent a message to Qatar on
the stance towards the conference that involves Israel, saying
that he will not reveal the final word until today when Qatari
Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim Bin Jabir al Thani
receives the letter.
</P>
<P>
The Arab countries have been split over whether to attend the
Doha conference as the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have ground
to a virtual halt and the peace process on the Lebanese and Syrian
tracks have been on ice since 21 months ago.
</P>
<P>
The League's stance came in line with the majority of Arab
countries that announced their boycott of the conference, namely,
Egypt, Syria, Palestinian National Authority, Saudi Arabia,
Morocco, the United Arab Emirates, Lebanon, Sudan, Iraq, Libya and
Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
So far, only Jordan, Kuwait, Oman, Yemen and Tunisia of the 16
Arab countries invited decided to show up.
</P>
<P>
The annual MENA conference, which has been held in Casablanca,
Amman and Cairo, was initiated in 1994 to integrate Israel into
the regional economy.

NANJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Successful efforts to control
earth subsidence have extended the life of an ancient leaning
pagoda in east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
The Huqiu Pagoda, located some 3.5 km northwest of Suzhou, is
the oldest large pagoda built with bricks south of the Yangtze
River.
</P>
<P>
Recent checks have revealed that a four-year effort carried out
by scientists in the 1980s has basically controlled the subsidence.
</P>
<P>
The checks also revealed that the pagoda is now in relatively
good condition.
</P>
<P>
The pagoda, constructed some 1,038 years ago, has been
subjected to centuries of earth subsidence.

<HEADLINE> EU Jobless Rate Unchanged for Three Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
its jobless rate stood at 10.6 percent at the end of September
1997, unchanged from that of August and July.
</P>
<P>
The seasonally-adjusted figure was 10.9 percent in the
corresponding month last year, said the Eurostat, the EU's
statistical office based in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate reached 10 percent in Germany after
rising continuously since the beginning of 1995. It was also 10
percent in Ireland, though the figure has been falling in the
country since mid-1993.
</P>
<P>
Four member states had rates above the EU's average. The rate
 was 19.9 percent in Spain. The figure, though it has been under
20 percent for three months in a row, remains the EU's highest
jobless rate. The other three countries are Finland with 13
percent, France 12.6 percent and Italy 12.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The lowest rates in September were registered in Luxembourg
with 3.7 percent and Austria with 4.5 percent. Eurostat estimated
that 17.9 million people were unemployed in the EU in September.

<HEADLINE> Sino-American Symposium And Cardiovascular Disease Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- A satellite symposium helped
acquaint doctors in the Chinese Cities of Beijing, Shanghai, and
Guangzhou with a meeting of the American Heart Association (AHA)
via a satellite downlink today.
</P>
<P>
More than 600 doctors were given information about recent
cardiovascular disease research by two Chinese doctors who are
attending the meeting in Orlando, Florida in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Kou Wenrong of Beijing Fuwai Hospital discussed a
cholesterol-reducing medicine, Pravastatin, made by Bristol-Myers
Squibb, which can reduce the incidence of strokes and heart
attacks by 20 percent and 29 percent respectively. Deaths from
heart attack also dropped by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The study, which involved 9,000 patients over a seven year
period, was conducted by an independent group of New Zealand and
Australian researchers under the auspices of the National Heart
Foundation of Australia with a grant from Squibb.
</P>
<P>
The "landmark study" is useful to people with or without heart
disease, and with varying cholesterol levels, said Prof. Gong
Lansheng of Shanghai Ruijin Hospital, and it is significant in
China because cardiovascular disease is the No.1 killer in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Experts have warned that the incidence of cardiovascular
disease will continue to rise in China because of changing
lifestyles and other factors.
</P>
<P>
Pravastatin is made in China by Shanghai Squibb Pharmaceuticals
Ltd., a Sino-American joint venture.

<HEADLINE> Flood Victims in Somalia Appeal for International </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, November 13 (Xinhua) -- At least 23 people were
drowned in flood waters following successive days of heavy rain
in Somalia's southwestern region of Bakol, reports from the area
said.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the deaths occurred in seven villages including
Bur Dhuhunle and Morogabey where inhabitants are now scattered on
the nearby mountains without shelter or food.
</P>
<P>
Elders from the Bur Dhuhunle who contacted reporters today via
VHF Radio said more than 1,075 head of goats and camels also died
in the waters.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that 335 houses and grain depots containing
31,300 quintals of sorghum were also destroyed by the floods in
the village.
</P>
<P>
The flood outcries are also coming from the coastal towns for
the first time since the heavy rains of the Deyr season began
some 45 days ago.
</P>
<P>
The white minority community of Baravani is now facing
difficulties created by the rains and began to flee the town by
the hundreds.
</P>
<P>
Amin Mohamed Nur, one of the prominent figures of the
community, told reporters that rain waters descended from the
mountains north of the town had washed away many old houses
including three Mosques.
</P>
<P>
Nur has appealed to the United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to campaign for the
preservation of the old, ancient and historic buildings of Brava,
225 km south of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Many more buildings are also likely to collapse owing to their
age and the strong winds accompanied with the rains, he noted,
adding that the main street linking the town of Brava to the
southern regions of the country is also endangered by the floods.
</P>
<P>
In response to the flood outcries, the European Commission has
confirmed to allocate an initial sum of 2.5 million U.S. Dollars
to the region with Somalia being the main focus.
</P>
<P>
A statement by the European Union today said this fund will go
through the European Community Humanitarian Office and the food
security unit of the European Commission to support emergency
humanitarian interventions through the Somalia aid coordination
body.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, this is also in response to the
appeals by the U.N. agencies and international aid organizations.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, only two small planes by United Nations
Children's Fund and World Food Program are reported to have
started bringing in blankets, nutritious biscuits and plastic
sheets for the flood displaced people in Gedo region in response
to the flood devastated communities of southern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
However, a large scale humanitarian assistance to southern
Somalia still requires much greater efforts, since there isn't
enough dry land for the planes to touch down and road
communication has been disrupted for more than a month now.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that so far the floods have claimed the lives
of nearly 150 people, killing thousands of animals and destroying
dozens of villages. Nearly one million people are believed to
have been displaced by the floods in southern Somalia.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets U.S. Senate Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here today that China and the United States should join in a
concerted effort to maintain the good momentum in the development
of Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks during a meeting with Frank Murkowski,
chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee of the
U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
Jiang welcomed the delegation led by Chairman Murkowski, the
first group of American guests to visit China since Jiang's recent
state visit to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed sincere gratitude for the warm welcome he
received from President Clinton, the U.S. government, the Congress
and the American people.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that he and President Clinton reached an important
consensus on the framework and orientation for developing
bilateral relations in the 21st century. Countries worldwide have
reacted positively to his U.S. visit and the improvement of
the Sino-U.S. relations, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that this fact alone serves as a proof that the
establishment of the Sino-US healthy and stable relations fully
conforms to the fundamental interests of the two peoples and
accords with the common desire of the people throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the U.S. Congress plays an important role in both
internal and external policy-making, and should thus play a
positive role in promoting, improving and developing
Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that many U.S. senators support the advancement of
the Sino-U.S. relations and have made positive contributions in
this regard. He expressed the hope that more senators will visit
China so as to enhance mutual understanding, eliminate
misunderstanding and expand common ground.
</P>
<P>
There is vast potentials for China and U.S. to develop
cooperation in many fields, particularly in the environmental
protection and energy sectors, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Murkowski congratulated President Jiang on the success of his
recent state visit to the United States, and noted that
the visit has brought the two countries closer together. The visit
had also conveyed a strong message to the American and Chinese
peoples, as well as the people throughout the world, that both the
United States and China are devoted to developing a friendly
cooperative relationship, he added.
</P>
<P>
Murkowski shared Jiang's view concerning the potential for
cooperation in the energy and environmental protection
sectors. Murkowski pledged to use his position as chairman of
the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to exert a
positive influence on the expansion of the Sino-U.S. cooperation in
the aforementioned sectors.

TOKYO, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Japan and Russia today agreed to
start talks for the final conclusion of a bilateral peace treaty
by the year of 2000, foreign ministry officials said.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi and his Russian counterpart

meeting in Krasnoyarsk, eastern Siberia, to make utmost efforts to
sign a peace treaty by the year of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Japan and Russia have not yet sign a peace treaty for more five
decades mainly due to a territorial dispute over a chain of
Russian-held islands off northern Japan.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Scientists Herald Discovery of "Heroic" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 13 (Xinhua) -- A pair of "heroic"
proteins that fling themselves onto damaged genes as a second
line of defense against genetic mutations has been discovered by
Weizman Institute of Israel.
</P>
<P>
DNA is damaged daily - by chemicals in cigarette smoke,
ultraviolet radiation, or other carcinogens - in a way that can
create genetic mutations, which can lead to disorders, including
cancer, according to the November 14 issue of the Journal of
Biological Chemistry.
</P>
<P>
The body uses a system of repair enzymes to correct this
damage, but what happens when the system fails?
</P>
<P>
Professor Zvi Livneh of the institute's biological chemistry
department, together his colleagues, discovered that a second
line of the defense based on "heroic proteins" fights mutation
development with "their own bodies."
</P>
<P>
The proteins, known as Fpg and Uvra, were previously known to
play a role in "cut-and-paste" DNA repair jobs. But now the
Weizman scientists have found they are no mere repairmen, but
physically attach themselves to damaged DNA, preventing it from
multiplying and causing a mutation.
</P>
<P>
The researchers believe the proteins may be part of a large
family of DNA repair proteins that work according to the same
principle. They discovered the proteins' new role by analyzing
common E coli bacteria and will follow up the research by
analyzing human cells.
</P>
<P>
"If we can fully understand this and other DNA repair
mechanisms, we may one day be able to turn them on in order to
prevent cancer," Livneh said.

There is also a demand for trained technicians and management
personnel in the international job market, especially in West
Asian countries, he said.

<HEADLINE> Meeting to Be Held Again to Press S. Leone into </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, November 13 (Xinhua) -- West African Peace-keeping
Force (ECOMOG) commanders said today they are to hold another
meeting soon with representatives of the military government "to
assess how decisions taken will get into concrete action."
</P>
<P>
One of the commanders told Xinhua here, "we are anxious to
deploy troops very quickly and the implementation program will be
carried out with the assistance of a United Nations team."
</P>
<P>
He said the ECOWAS Committee of Five is now in New York for
discussions with the U.N. Security Council for it to put a team
in place to work alongside them.
</P>
<P>
The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)
empowered Nigeria, Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea and Liberia as
the Five of Committee to carry out talks with Sierra Leone's
military junta on the issue of returning power to ousted
President T. Kabbah who was toppled in a May 25 coup.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there are some controversies over some aspect of
the agreement reached between ECOMOG and the Sierra Leone junta
at last Tuesday's meeting in Grafton, 13 miles east of the
capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG delegation was led by field commander, general
Victor Malu.
</P>
<P>
The chief of staff of the military headquarters, Colonel
Gabriel Mani told Xinhua, "General Malu has given a wrong
impression to the outside world about certain aspects of the
meeting. I told Malu at the meeting that the Sierra Leone army
will not agree to be disarmed."
</P>
<P>
After that Malu said there was no point in going on with the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Director of Defense Information, Major John Milton said,
"the Sierra Leone army is a national institution and will
therefore not be allowed to be disarmed."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials from the ministry of children's affairs
are undertaking a registration of all children under arms as from
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We are covering the 12 districts and the western area,
including the capital, for one week and we shall meet with
paramount chiefs, religious leaders, the people's army, the
police and the Kamajors to get them to help," said Samuel Kaikai,
who is leading the exercise.

JERUSALEM, November 13 (Xinhua) -- More than 15,000 operations
have been postponed in Israeli public hospitals in the past nine
weeks amid repeated protests by the Israel Medical Association
(IMA), local newspaper The Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the surgicals will be shut again in public
hospitals today except for emergencies, as part of a series of
protests launched in September by the IMA against the Treasury's
refusal to carry out an agreement to pay for hiring 360 more
doctors.
</P>
<P>
IMA Chairman Yoram Blachar said that the number of doctors per
hospital bed in Israel was one of the lowest in the world. "We
are fighting not for increased salaries but for improved medical
treatment and relieving overcrowding in the internal medical
departments," he said.
</P>
<P>
Blachar accused the Treasury of reducing the number of
hospital beds per 1,000 residents to 2.3, as compared with 3.5 in
the United States, 3.9 in Greece and seven in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Health Minister Yehoshua Matza also confronted Finance
Minister Yaakov Neeman about the issue during the Israeli Cabinet
meeting Wednesday, and demanded immediate action to resolve the

<HEADLINE> Full Text of Sino-Yugoslav Joint Statement (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The following is the full text
of a Sino-Yugoslav joint statement on bilateral friendship and
relations of cooperation signed here this afternoon by Chinese
President Jiang Zemin and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
during the latter's state visit to China:
</P>
<P>
 JOINT STATEMENT OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA AND
</P>
<P>
THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA ON BILATERAL
</P>
<P>
 FRIENDSHIP AND RELATIONS OF COOPERATION
</P>
<P>
The People's Republic of China and the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (hereinafter abbreviated as "the two sides"), on the
basis of the traditional friendship, especially the fruitful
cooperation in the fields of politics, economy, science,
technology, culture and education between the two countries,
starting from the aspiration of developing a long-term, stable and
all-round bilateral relationship, in accordance with the practical
principles of international laws, aimed at promoting the peace and
prosperity in Asia and Europe permanently into the 21st century
and further strengthening and enhancing bilateral ties established
on the basis of friendship, understanding, equality and mutual
benefit, state as follows:
</P>
<P>
1. The two sides hold that the multipolarization tendency in
the world is speeding up and developing countries, as a whole, are
playing an increasingly important role in international affairs;
regional economic cooperation organizations are showing their
great vitality; the development of politics, economy, and culture
in different countries are varied in form.
</P>
<P>
The consensus of mutual respect and mutual benefits instead of
interfering in the other's internal affairs and of imposing one's
will on others, dialogue and cooperation instead of confrontation
and conflict is being reached by more and more countries.
</P>
<P>
The two sides oppose the use of force or the threat of using
force in international relations.
</P>
<P>
The two sides hold that the present international situation is
generally more relaxed, and peace and development are the main
themes of the current times. But Cold-War thinking, hegemonism and
power politics still exist. The world economy is developing in an
imbalanced way and the gap between rich and poor is still widening.
</P>
<P>
The People's Republic of China and the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia are willing to further increase their consultations and
cooperation in international affairs and strive for establishing
a peaceful, stable, fair, and just new international political and
economic orders, and for safeguarding world peace and promoting
the joint development of mankind.
</P>
<P>
2. The Chinese side respects the independence, sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,
respects the way of development chosen by the Yugoslav people,
speaks highly of the independent foreign policy pursued by the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and its tremendous efforts and
contributions to consolidating the peace process in
Bosnia-Herzegovina and resolving peacefully the crisis in the
former Yugoslavia region.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side appreciates the active efforts by the Yugoslav
side in stabilizing the situation in southeastern Europe and
reiterates its support for the return of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia to the international community.

3. The Yugoslav side reiterated its elaborated principled stance
on the Taiwan issue, emphasizing that there is only one China in
the world. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia recognizes that
there is only one China and that Taiwan is an inalienable part of
the People's Republic of China and that the government of the
People's Republic of China is the sole legal government that
represents the people of China as a whole. The Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia will not set up official relations or have official
contacts with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav side values the active role that the People's
Republic of China plays in international affairs, highly praises
the contributions that the People's Republic of China has made to
maintaining the peace and security in Asia and even in the world,
and highly appreciates the independent foreign policy of peace
that the People's Republic of China pursues.
</P>
<P>
4. The People's Republic of China and the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia are friends. The two countries and the two peoples
share a deep friendship of long tradition. The two sides expressed
satisfaction with their cooperation in the fields of politics,
economy, culture and education in recent years.
</P>
<P>
They both agreed that developing friendship and relations of
cooperation between the two countries on a long-term, stable and
comprehensive basis is in conformity with the common aspiration of
the two peoples and in the fundamental interests of the two
countries, and also beneficial to peace and development of Asia
and Europe.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Spaniards Held for Smuggling of Gun Parts in Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Three Spanish nationals were
held Wednesday night at an international airport here for trying
to bring in a suitcase filled with gun parts, the Philippine News
Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
At the Ninoy Aquino International Airport, customs police
detected the gun parts stuffed in a large suitcase checked in by
the three Spanish passengers.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines' law prohibits anyone from importing guns or
gun parts without permit from the country's Firearms and
Explosives Office.
</P>
<P>
The three Spanish nationals are being investigated to find out
who their connections or consignees are in Manila.
</P>
<P>
Investigators said the three could be charged with illegal
possession of firearms even if what have been confiscated from
them are gun parts and accessories.
</P>
<P>
Among the gun parts brought in by the three suspects include a
number of barrels, recoil springs and stabilizers.

<HEADLINE> Asian Strength Halts Australian Stocks' Slide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Australian stocks ended
trading marginally down but well off their intraday lows after a
firmer than expected performance by Asian markets lifted midday
gloom.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index ended 6.9 points down at 2,504.0.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index dropped 1.9 points to 4,214.0 and all
resources slipped 11.7 to 1,148.0.
</P>
<P>
"All things considered it is a pretty good performance,
especially since we were down 30 more points at lunchtime," a
Lodge and Partners broker said.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index touched a low of 2,468.3 earlier in
the day as the market was gripped by fears that Tokyo and Hong
Kong would suffer after Wall Street's near 160 point fall
overnight.
</P>
<P>
The resources sector was again the hardest hit today with
industrial stocks slipping only marginally and bank and media
stocks among the best performers.
</P>
<P>
Bellwether BHP ended 15 cents lower at 14.30 Australian
dollars, well off its opening low of 14.051 Australian dollars but
still well down from the week's peak of 15.06 Australian dollars
reached on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Global miner Rio Tinto also softened, ending below 17.00
Australian dollars again for the first time since the October 28
crash. It fell 8.5 cents to 16.955 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Industrial stocks closed down marginally with most of the gains
in banking and media stocks.
</P>
<P>
All the majors apart from Westpac bank gained, with ANZ bank,
up 27 cents to 10.00 Australian dollars, leading, but Commonwealth
bank, 13 cents stronger at 17.20 Australian dollars, and NAB bank,
1.7 cents higher at 20.795 Australian dollars, also improved.
</P>
<P>
Westpac fell 6.2 cents to 8.678 Australian dollars, and brokers
said the interest in Commonwealth continued to be sparked by its
buyback scheme announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
News Corp led media stocks higher as it gained 10.7 cents to
7.25 Australian dollars and its preferred shares put on 16 cents
to 6.56 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
National turnover exceeded 305 million shares and valued at
more than 635 million US dollars, with falls outnumbering rises
by 624 to 378.
</P>
<P>
Gold stocks again followed the precious metal down as it
slipped 1.65 US dollars to 307.60 US dollars in Sydney trading.
</P>
<P>
The gold index dropped 18.2 points to 1,008.8.

<HEADLINE> Nigerians Called to Depend Less on Foreign Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Head of State General Sani
Abacha has called on his countrymen to reduce dependence on foreign
goods in the process of improving their standard of living.
</P>
<P>
It is important to ensure the success of the Family Economic
Advancement Program designed to harness all the potentials that abound
in the country with a view to establishing family-based cottage
industries, mainly in rural areas, said General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
The government believes the program will advance the much desired
economic empowerment of the rural populace, Abacha said on Wednesday
while inaugurating the governing board of the program in the capital
Abuja.
</P>
<P>
He therefore called on members of the governing board to be
selfless and dedicated in carrying out their assignment.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has a population of about 100 million, most of who live in
the countryside where life is hard for the people due to lack of
development.
</P>
<P>
The overdependence on oil production also leads to insufficient
evolvement of the manufacturing industry. As a result, the country has
to import most of the daily necessities to meet the domestic need.
</P>
<P>
The program, which has been incorporated in the country's long-term
socio-economic development program known as Vision 2010, is expected
to lead to the setting up of many small industries to produce locally
needed goods with rich natural and human resources.
</P>
<P>
With the participation and support of banks, technological
institutions and related government departments, the program would
help remove the impediments to family economic empowerment and uplift
rural dwellers economically, said Abacha.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Weaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Firming expectations that the
Reserve Bank of Australia would leave interest rates unchanged in
the near term failed to shake the Australian dollar out of the
doldrums today.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange traders said the fallout from the turmoil on
Asian financial markets continued to be the pervading influence on
the local currency which settled at 69.28 US cents, down from
69.85 Wednesday despite a short-covering rally late in the
session.
</P>
<P>
The currency had struggled from the beginning of the local
session when it opened more than half a US cent lower in line with
a falling gold price.
</P>
<P>
Colonial State Bank foreign exchange manager Peter Whitley said
the market had already factored in the likelihood of no further
rate cut due to the volatility in the Australian dollar and,
therefore, today's news did not carry much weight.
</P>
<P>
"We saw a little bit of a short-covering rally after the market
tested 69.00 US cents," Whitley said.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, the outlook for the Australian dollar remains
extremely negative.
</P>
<P>
"The possibility of the Asian debacle flowing through to our
economy is outweighing any internal factors completely."
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar also finished at 86.91 Japanese yen, from
87.60 yen in Sydney previously, and at 1.1924 German marks from
1.1934 marks.

<HEADLINE> Iraq not for Confrontation but Cooperation with UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi government does
not expect any conflict but is ready to cooperate with the
United Nations over the arms inspection, a senior Iraqi diplomat
said here today.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Iraqi charge d'affaires
Salah Noor Samarmad said the Iraqi government expected that the
five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council would have
equal right to join the U.N. inspection team monitoring Iraq's
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Samarmad said that so far most members of the U.N. inspection
teams are Americans, who "gather secret information about Iraq and
had activities which had no connection with the arms inspection."
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government does not want to have any conflict with
the U.N. or the U.S., Samarmad stressed, on the contrary, Baghdad
hopes the U.N. embargo on the country to be lifted through "normal
cooperation" between Iraq and the U.N. and "in this way to give
the Iraqi people a normal life."
</P>
<P>
Samarmad attacked the U.S. for putting pressure on the U.N.
to impose new sanctions against his country, saying that
Washington's real objective "was to destroy our government and
our nation."
</P>
<P>
About the U.S. threat to launch military attack on Iraq if
Baghdad continues to reject the Americans in the U.N. team,
Samarmad said Baghdad would not worry about the U.S. attack
and "we are ready to defend our country."
</P>
<P>
He said that most members of the U.N. Security Council
including Russia, China and France as permanent members, have
announced their opposition to the U.S. military attack.
</P>
<P>
Since October 29, the Iraqi government has been rejecting
U.S. members of the U.N. inspection team to join in the
U.N. missions in Iraq, triggering a new crisis between Baghdad
and the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council Wednesday unanimously passed a
resolution condemning Iraq for rejecting American inspectors in the
U.N. mission and slapped a ban on travel abroad by Iraqi officials
impeding U.N. arms inspection teams from doing their duties.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf
reiterated early Wednesday that his government would not change its
stance, even if the U.N. imposes new embargo on his country
by barring travels of Iraqi officials.

<HEADLINE> Two Foreigners Deported from Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
deported a South African and a Briton for their alleged racist
behaviour, Principal Immigration Officer Frank Kwinga has said.
</P>
<P>
The principal immigration officer said on Wednesday
that Alan Reynolds, a South African, left the country on Tuesday,
and British Wesley Winter, left abroad a London bound British
Airways flight on Monday, accordling to a Daily Nation report
today.
</P>
<P>
He said: "We cannot allow people to bring Nyoko Nyoko
(trouble) here. We are independent and we should be respected."
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi cautioned that
the government would not tolerate arrogant and insolent foreign
employees who abused Africans.
</P>
<P>
He demanded the South African, Alan Reynolds, to stop
insulting black employees, or "pack up and go home". He asked
the Briton to stop similar behaviour.
</P>
<P>
The people of Kenya are not ready to sell their dignity and
self-esteem for foreign investment, Moi stressed.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the South African, who came to Kenya in
1976 as an employee of Twiga Chemicals, was boasting that he came
from a more civilized community.
</P>
<P>
Wesley Winter was picked up at his company's office in the
industrial area in Nairobi and taken to Jomo Kenyatta
International Airport, according to Kenya's Immigration
Department.

<HEADLINE> FIS: Downhill Compromise Not Enough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 13 (Xinhua) -- International Ski Federation
(FIS) said on Thursday that a compromise proposal by the Nagano
Winter Olympics organisers over the start for the men's downhill
was not enough to end the row.
</P>
<P>
Nagano Organising Committee (NAOC) director-general Makoto
Kobayashi said, in a major reversal on Tuesday, he would not
oppose raising the start of the downhill to 1,740 meters, 60
meters short of the height demanded by the International Ski
Federation.
</P>
<P>
"I have heard 1,740, which as everyone knows is not acceptable
because it is a very steep part (of the mountain)," FIS
secretary-general Gian Franco Kasper told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"But I believe that it is a step forward from NAOC that they
are now ready to discuss the different possibilities and this
might be very helpful," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kobayashi said a higher starting point was possible as long as
the starting gate and the course both remained outside a national
park, which covers a section of the top part of the mountain.
</P>
<P>
That was a major public stepdown for Kobayashi, who has
strongly rejected FIS requests to raise the start to 1,800 metes,
saying that would break environmental laws by putting it into the
park.
</P>
<P>
FIS has argued it is unfair because recreational skiers already
use the park, and that because the area between the park and a
chairlift which runs along the edge of it is so narrow, it is not
possible to set up a course outside the park.
</P>
<P>
"There is no way, unfortunately, you can ski outside (the
park)," said Kasper, who is in Nagano to attend a meeting of the
International Olympic Committee radio and television commission.
</P>
<P>
But Kasper added that FIS would have course designer Bernhard
Russi inspect the mountain again, probably within the next two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
"I think we have to look at this (proposal) on the mountain.
It is purely a technical question," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the results of the inspection would go to a new
consultative committee seeking to unravel the protracted dispute
that has overshadowed preparations for next February's Games.
</P>
<P>
NAOC, the Japan Olympic Committee, and the Ski Association of
Japan decided on Tuesday to set up the committee, although it was
not given a clear mandate.
</P>
<P>
Under Kobayashi's proposal, the chairlift would have its chairs
and cables removed during the Olympics, creating a wider race
course area outside the park.
</P>
<P>
The current course starting at 1,680 meters has a racing time
of about one minute 30 seconds, about 15 seconds below the winning
time at the 1994 Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
NAOC says a 1,740-meter start would add about nine or 10
seconds to the race.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian-British Trade Expands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Trade between Nigeria and the
United Kingdom of Britain has been growing in the first eight
months of this year, despite their rows over democracy and human
rights.
</P>
<P>
Figures provided by the British High Commission in Lagos show
that British exports to Nigeria totalled 460 million U.S. dollars
in the first eight months, exceeding that of the same period of
1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
There is no figure concerning Nigeria's export to Britain, but
the high commission estimated that it is the highest since 1993,
except 1996.
</P>
<P>
British exports to Nigeria are mainly machinery, transport and
other equipment, manufactured goods and chemicals.
</P>
<P>
According to David Pearey, Commercial Counsellor of the
British High Commission, British assets in Nigeria is worth of
about 3.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The counsellor continued that except in the oil and gas
sector, there is little new investment coming into Nigeria from
Britain due to the political and economic conditions in Nigeria,
which he said, are not attractive to potential investors.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Trade with India to be Boosted: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- India's decision to slash
trade restrictions, including quantitative ones, would boost
Australian exports by at least 30 million Australian dollars (21
million US dollars) a year, Deputy Prime Minister and Trade
Minister Tim Fischer said today.
</P>
<P>
"In the longer term it will be even more important and is
likely to lift our exports by some 140 million US dollars a year,"
Fischer said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement, which follows negotiations in the World Trade
Organization (WTO), could become effective as soon as next week."
</P>
<P>
Fischer also said Australia had used the WTO to negotiate
additional benefits on products of special interest to Australia.
</P>
<P>
"Some 177 of our priority products will be free of quantitative
restrictions before April 2000, including salmon, prawns,
scallops, grated cheese, orange juice, opals, sapphires and solar
water heaters," Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
India's restriction, in place for almost 40 years for
balance-of-payment reasons, have limited Australia's access to the
Indian market, the deputy prime minister said.

MACAO, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Macao government has taken
measures to address the millennium problem on computers and it
hopes all computers at government departments will be immune from
the problem by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Administrative and Civil Service Department
(ACSD) recently conducted a survey among 25 computerized
departments of the government. Half of the 16 respondents say that
they have started re-programming the computers to avoid the
so-called "millennium bug", while the others are making assessment
and plans for the move.
</P>
<P>
Due to problems in programming, the "bug" will lead computers
to make wrong judgment when it comes to the year 2000. If not
adjusted, experts say, it will cause damages, sometimes very
serious.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Seeks U.N. Assistance in Solving Sierra </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom
Ikimi has called on the United Nations to extend military and
technical assistance to the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS) in its efforts to return democracy to Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
In a statement which was conveyed by Nigeria's permanent
mission to the U.N. on Wednesday, Ikimi said military assistance
is "highly desirable and necessary" so that an observers' group
could be deployed in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Such a group, he said, will provide assistance to the ECOWAS
peace-keeping force (ECOMOG) now already in Sierra Leone, in the
same way as the U.N. Observers' Mission in Liberia (UNIMOL).
</P>
<P>
Ikimi also called for technical and material assistance from
the U.N., saying that it will enable ECOMOG to enforce the
sanctions imposed on Sierra Leone and maintain peace and
security.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Conakry agreement signed between ECOWAS and
the military regime of Sierra Leone, Ikimi said all the armed
persons in Sierra Leone will be disarmed by ECOMOG by the end of
December.
</P>
<P>
If attacked, he said, ECOMOG will normally defend itself in
conformity with the rules of engagement in peace-keeping
operations.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi also stressed the need for the international community
to provide relief materials to refugees who have fled to
neighbouring Guinea and Liberia.
</P>
<P>
If ECOWAS's collective efforts result in the final and
peaceful settlement of the crisis in Sierra Leone, the stability
of the west Africa sub-region would have been restored and the
way paved towards economic and zonal development, the Nigerian
Foreign Minister said.

BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese People's
Liberation Army (PLA) has adopted a positive attitude toward
promoting friendship and cooperation with the Yugoslav armed
forces based on mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Chinese General Fu Quanyou, chief of the PLA General Staff,
made the remarks today during a meeting with his Yugoslav
counterpart Momcilo Perisic, who is accompanying Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic on a state visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Fu noted that China and Yugoslavia have enjoyed a long history
of cooperation, and that their peoples share deep feelings of
friendship.
</P>
<P>
He said, Chinese President Jiang Zemin announced in his report
to the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
that China will reduce its armed forces by half a million
people over the next three years. The new round of reduction
will follow a one-million-man reduction in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The move shows that China is a major power to maintain world
peace, and that the PLA is devoted to safeguarding peace, said Fu.
</P>
<P>
Perisic briefed Fu on the European situation and Yugoslavia's
domestic affairs. He expressed the hope that relations between the two
armed forces will continue to grow.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Step up Defense Ties with Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Australia is to step up
defense ties with Indonesia and other regional countries, through
more joint training, exercises and other activities, Defense
Minister Ian McLachlan said today.
</P>
<P>
McLachlan said the increase in regional activities would be
outlined in the forthcoming Australian government strategic
review.
</P>
<P>
He foreshadowed the increase in regional defense activities in
a statement detailing his meeting today with Indonesian Defense
Minister General Edi Sudradjat in northern Australia's coastal
city of Adelaide.
</P>
<P>
"In particular, increased emphasis in the next 12 months will
be given to officer exchanges at junior levels," he said in the
statement.
</P>
<P>
A new scheme, called the Defense Cooperation Scholarship
Scheme,
has been established to support post graduate study for young
military officers with leadership potential, McLachlan said.
</P>
<P>
"The defense ministers agreed that this was an important
investment in the long-term future of a close bilateral
relationship," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a major speech earlier this week, McLachlan outlined the
move to even greater regional defense cooperation, on the basis of
the steps taken by the previous Labor government.
</P>
<P>
McLachlan said today his meeting with General Sudradjat was
part of the annual bilateral talks on security and defense issues.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesia was Australia's most significant regional
neighbor and regular open dialogue was important to the
maintenance of regional stability.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two ministers also reviewed current
cooperative defense activities.

<HEADLINE> Problems of Early Sexual Maturity Cited by Doctor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Shi Yumin, a paediatrician at
Shanghai Paediatrics Hospital (SPH), has expressed concern about
the growing number of children with signs of early sexual maturity.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Shi said one of the effects of early sexual development is
shorter stature. The final height of about 30 percent of
early-maturing girls does not exceed 150 centimeters (5 feet), he
said.
</P>
<P>
This early sexual maturity also can impair children's
psychological makeup, he said, particularly when children's
intelligence and sexual maturity levels are
incompatible. Depression in such children is one of the problems
that result, he added.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Shi said early sexual maturity can be traced to two main
reasons: pathological, such as an endocrine imbalance; and
external, such as ingesting medicine or food containing hormones.
</P>
<P>
Parents should keep medicine out of the reach of children and
be careful about their food intake, he said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Shi said that Ginseng royal jelly has been proven through
testing to induce early sexual maturity. Milk, pork and chicken
may contribute, he said, but at this time there is inadequate
proof.
</P>
<P>
One SPH clinic, open one day a week, used to treat 500 to 800
such patients weekly. Now the department, open five days a week,
treats 150 patients daily. Four other hospitals in Shanghai, which
have similar departments, have reported similar patient loads.

<HEADLINE> New Analysis: Currency Worries Test HK's Competitiveness (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's competitiveness,
which is arguably eroded by the high cost of wages and property
prices, is now facing a further challenge in the wake of the Asian
currency turmoil.
</P>
<P>
The city has become relatively expensive for foreign tourists
and overseas importers, as speculative attacks triggered the
depreciation of a string of currencies in the region and left
Hong Kong dollar's peg to the greenback unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Cheaper prices might improve exports, but economists here
warned that devaluation is not the right answer to
competitiveness. "A lower-price strategy will not be sustainable
if it is not matched by real gains in efficiency or productivity,"
said Dr. Chan Wai-kwan, assistant director of the Hong Kong
General Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
"Devaluation for its own sake is not competitiveness," said
Chan," it is beggar-thy-neighbor. If devaluation worked, then
economies would be competing to make their currencies cheaper."
</P>
<P>
A recent economic report by the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation (HSBC) says: "The immediate impact (of the
devaluation of Asian currencies) is not expected to be overly
significant."
</P>
<P>
The report argues that there is a limited overlap between Hong
Kong products and that of the other Asian economies, and the
increasing demand for services from the China's inland areas will
partly offset the loss of business opportunities for Hong
Kong.

Andrew Fernow, research head of Vickers Ballas Hong Kong
Limited also stressed the role of services, which now account for
more than 80 percent of Hong Kong's GDP, compared with less than
10 percent for manufacturing. "The issue of competitiveness must
be addressed in consideration of the city's role as one of the
world's leading financial and business centers," he said.
</P>
<P>
He did not think that substantial devaluation would attract
firms to move their headquarters and regional offices into
Southeast Asian countries where still lack the necessary
infrastructure and advanced information technology.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Prof. Y. C. Jao at the School of
Economics and Finance, University of Hong Kong, said: "Hong Kong's
advantage lies in its strong adaptability and high flexibility,
which have helped the city go through many difficult times and
quickly regain its strength over the past decades."
</P>
<P>
In his view, competitiveness should be achieved through raising
productivity, lowering costs, enhancing education, and applying
new technology.
</P>
<P>
High level of property prices has long been a worry for Hong
Kong's competitiveness. Prof. Jao argued that high prices,
determined by the market mechanism, indicate strong demand for
properties in Hong Kong, and the problem should be tackled still
by market forces, namely increasing supply.
</P>
<P>
Actually the interest rate-sensitive property sector has gone
downturn after Hong Kong's primary interest rates were pushed up
to fend off speculators. Prof. Jao said that the adjustment of
property prices, though painful, might be good for the long-term,
healthy development of Hong Kong's economy.

Salah Noori Samarmad said the Iraqi government has informed the
Iranian authorities that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein would
not attend the OIC summit.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf
would accompany Ramadam to express Baghdad's views at the OIC
summit.
</P>
<P>
However, Samarmad did not specify what proposals the Iraqi
delegation would deliver to the OIC summit.
</P>
<P>
Referring to relations between Iraq and Iran, Samarmad said
that Baghdad was ready to improve its relations with Iran since
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami has voiced Tehran's
willingness to develop friendly ties with neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Iraqi government has taken positive steps to
improve relations with Iran by allowing Iranian citizens to pay
religious pilgrimage to the Shiite shrines in southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It is the Iranian authorities that did not issue permission
for Iranian citizens to visit Iraq, Samarmad said, however,
hundreds of overseas Iranians travel to southern Iraq every day
through other countries.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi diplomat also rejected the Iranian accusation that
Baghdad still holds more than 15,000 Iranian prisoners of war
(POWs) of the Iran-Iraq war, saying that Iraq has released all
Iranian POWs.
</P>
<P>
Iran has said that during the past years, it has released
several hundreds of Iraqi POWs as "unilateral humanitarian
measures to solve the POW issue between the two country."
</P>
<P>
Iran repeatedly accused Iraq of giving no response to Iran's
goodwill gesture.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
worked out a national environment management action plan in an
effort to solve the country's environmental problems, the national
news agency BSS reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a three-day meeting of the South Asia Association
of Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Technical Committee on Environment
and Meteorology here Wednesday, Environment and Forest Minister
Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury said that "the process of preparing the
national environment management action plan is highly
participatory involving NGOs, academicians, parliamentarians,
lawyers, journalists and people at the grassroot levels."
</P>
<P>
A national environmental committee has been formed under the
chairmanship of the prime minister in this regard, she said.
</P>
<P>
She said that "We are now able to reduce the extent of damage
caused by natural disasters with the improved forecasting
early-warning services, adequate prior preparedness, timely
management and massive afforestation program in the coastal
areas."
</P>
<P>
The enormous loss of human lives and properties caused by
natural disasters and degradation of environment, she pointed out,
are two of the most serious problems of this South Asian country,
which are mostly meteorological phenomena that hinder the economic
development and growth.
</P>
<P>
She noted that Bangladesh is a constant victim of natural
disasters such as cyclones, tidal surges, floods, tornadoes,
torrential rain and droughts which always cause havoc every year
to human lives and property.
</P>
<P>
The rapid degradation of environment in the region is a serious
concern to the people and the governments of the SAARC countries,
she noted.
</P>
<P>
She said regional cooperation among the SAARC nations is a must
to provide a basis for the member countries to draw up policy
measures and recommendations keeping in view the potential and
possibilities of evolving a regional plan of action.

JAKARTA -- Concerned about developments in Iraq, Indonesia
urged all parties involved to exercise self-restraint and
immediately end their conflicts to avoid a possible recurrence of
the Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
"We (Indonesia) do not want to see a war again in the region or
arms being used like several years ago," Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas said here on Wednesday. To increase sanctions on Iraq was
not the answer to the problem but would even complicate the
situation, and the sanction imposed so far had not met any target
or fulfilled the hopes but had caused grief among the civilian
population, including women, children and old people, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Share prices fell during the
day's trading but only finished higher on the Singapore market as
the benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index gained 4.9 points to
end at 1,690.69 points today.
</P>
<P>
The day's slide came in the wake of a sharp 157-point sell-off

no urgency to sell. They noted that buyers were on the sidelines
and the volume had gone dead.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume was almost steady at 142.38 million

million US dollars). Declines outnumbered advances by 217 to 103,
while 292 other counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Land was the most actively traded counter as it

<HEADLINE> Russia to Return French Archives Seized in World War II </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Russia will return all French
archives seized by the Soviet troops in Berlin at the end of World
War II, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported today.
</P>
<P>
A France-Russia commission will meet next month to study the
way to return these archives, which were taken to Germany from
France by German troops in 1940, and submit a report to the
parliaments of the two countries for approval.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac personally asked Russia to
return the archives "as soon as possible" during his visit to
Moscow in September, said the French news agency.
</P>
<P>
Most of the archives, which numbered at more than 900,000 and
were dated between the two world wars, are on national security
issues, including the private archives of the well-known French
politician Leon Blum, the Rothschild family, the episcopate of the
Roman Catholic Church in Strasbourg and Jewish associations.
</P>
<P>
AFP quoted Vladimir Semago, member of the Russian State Duma
and coordinator of the France-Russia commission on the archives,
as saying that Russia had already sent back 95 percent of those
French archives.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is the moral obligation of Russia to return the
remaining French archives which belong to the French
people.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu to Hold National Unity Talk With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 13 (Xinhua) -- In a step toward realizing
his call for national unity, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu is expected to hold a conciliation talk with opposition
Labor leader Ehud Barak late this month.
</P>
<P>
This was announced Wednesday night by lawmaker Yehuda Harel, a
senior member of the coalition party The Third Way which is
making intense efforts to create a national unity government.
</P>
<P>
Harel's statement came after Public Security Minister Avigdor
Kahalani, head of The Third Way, held a meeting with Netanyahu
Wednesday night to discuss the possibility of forming a unity
government between the largest parties the Likud and Labor.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani believed that a national unity government is
necessary at a time when the division among the society is
deepening and the peace process is facing tremendous difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Harel revealed that Netanyahu planned to invite Labor leader
Barak for holding a conciliatory meeting after his return from
the visit to the United States next week. Netanyahu departed
today for a visit to Britain and the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Kahalani also met with Barak after his meeting with Netanyahu
on the unity government talk, but it remains unclear whether Barak
has agreed to accept the Third Way initiative. Harel added that if
the Netanyahu-Barak meeting is held, it would be a step in the
direction of forming a national unity government.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani reportedly threatened to recommend that his party
leave the coalition unless a unity government is formed.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani's initiative was launched at a time when Israel is
marking the second anniversary of the assassination of later
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
Rabin was killed two years ago by Yigal Amir, a radical Jew who
was widely believed to be incited by the rightist activists who
depicted Rabin as a Jewish traitor because of his peace policies.
</P>
<P>
Then Likud leader Netanyahu was held for partially responsible
for launching the inciting campaign against Rabin that led to his
assassination.
</P>
<P>
The leftist camp is taking advantage of the second anniversary
of Rabin' death to pressure Netanyahu to offer an official apology
for his role in Rabin's murder, but was turned down. The rightist
camp charged the leftists for politically exploiting the murder of
Rabin to launch an inciting campaign of its own.
</P>
<P>
Security experts warned recently that because of the deepening
division of the Israeli society and the political tension,
political assassinations are possible to occur.
</P>
<P>
To prevent further internal division, some politicians issued
calls for national conciliation. Netanyahu in recent speeches has
calmed his tone and called for national reconciliation, saying he
is extending his hands out to the opposition for that sake.
</P>
<P>
Knesset (Parliament) Speaker Dan Tichon, spoke at the ceremony
marking Rabin's death, urged the Likud and Labor to join hands in
forming a unity government to heal the internal division and deal
with the difficulties facing the Israeli-Arab peace process.
</P>
<P>
But Labor officials cast doubt over the possibility of forming
a unity government with Netanyahu-led Likud. Yossi Beilin, senior
Labor lawmaker, said national unity is important for the nation
but labor would not do so with Netanyahu, who he described as
"someone not fit to be premier."

<HEADLINE> IMF Presents Positive Report on Israeli Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Israel's economy is
"generally positive" and the medium-term prospects are
"favorable," but only as long as the "right policies are
pursued," according to an International Monetary Fund's (IMF)
report.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post reported today that after 10 days of
meeting with Israeli government officials, businessmen and
economists, an IMF team handed its initial annual report to
Israeli Finance Minister Yaacov Neeman and Bank of Israel
Governor Jacob Frenkel.
</P>
<P>
The five-page document said "the Israeli current fiscal policy
is well on its way to meeting the deficit target despite
difficult economic circumstances."
</P>
<P>
Inflation has been brought within the target range, the
current-account deficit has become more manageable and the
slowdown in economic growth appears to have come to a halt, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
However, it said that as labor force growth slows, economic
growth will have to rely on faster labor productivity growth,
which can only be achieved through greater investment and
technical progress.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government needs to do more than merely achieving
its fiscal aim of a budget deficit of 1.5 percent of the gross
domestic product by 2001, the report said, adding that there is
"a strong case for greater fiscal adjustment, namely to achieve,
at a minimum, approximate balance in terms of the government's
accounting system by 2001."
</P>
<P>
It is now time for Israel to act as part of the advanced world
and "play its leadership role in promoting better economic
performance world over through its own unwavering efforts to
stick to appropriate policies," the report noted.
</P>
<P>
The four-member IMF team will work out the final version of
the report on the Israeli economy in Washington in the coming
months.

<HEADLINE> IMF Chief Calls for Setting Up Surveillance Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 13 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) said here today that Asian
countries are more in the need of setting up a regional
surveillance group, than a regional fund, in order to prevent
another currency crisis from reoccurring.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Michel Camdessus, Managing
Director of the IMF, said that this surveillance system will serve
Asia better than the proposed Asian Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus, who arrived here on Wednesday on a two-day visit as
part of his Southeast Asia tour, said regional countries should
look at prevention rather than the creation of a standby fund to
bail out another crisis in the future.
</P>
<P>
He therefore called for the establishment of a regional
surveillance system so that Asian economies can use "peer
pressure" to alert each other of potential problems.
</P>
<P>
The IMF leader noted that from his recent experience in trying
to work out assistance packages for countries such as Thailand and
Indonesia that the regional financing was not in short supply to
bail out troubled economies.
</P>
<P>
Instead, what was missing was a regional surveillance system to
alert countries to potential trouble, he stressed.

</P>
<P>
The digital broadcasting is sponsored by the Washington-based

Broadcasting Corporation programs anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
He noted that news and entertainment radio programs would be
transmitted to the satellite which is capable of broadcasting 288
channels and then beamed down over the vast regions.
</P>
<P>
The Nairobi launch will be followed by others in Asia and
Latin America in 1999, Samara said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iran Passes Law on Registration of Foreign Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian Majlis approved
a law Wednesday to allow foreign firms to register in the
country, the Iranian official news agency IRNA reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the law, any legal foreign companies can
register their overseas branches or representative offices in Iran
within the framework of Iran's regulations.
</P>
<P>
However, the authorization is subject to reciprocal arrangements
with their respective countries, allowing Iranian firms to have
representation in those countries.
</P>
<P>
It also obligated the foreign firms to confine their
activities within the Iranian laws, rules and regulations.
</P>
<P>
The executive circular pertaining to the enforcement of the
law will be forwarded by the Ministry of Finance and Economic
Affairs to the cabinet ministers for final approval.
</P>
<P>
Since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, foreign firms were not
allowed to be legally represented and any activities in Iran
required a special authorization from the government.
</P>
<P>
The Approval of the law was considered here as a new step by
the Iranian government to attract more foreign investment in the
country's oil and gas industries, in an effort to defuse the
U.S. economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that the Iranian Oil Ministry would put forward
some projects for foreign companies to invest in Iran's offshore
oil and gas fields.
</P>
<P>
At present about 30 foreign companies are active in Iran.

<HEADLINE> Levy Waiting for Formal Invitation to Doha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy is still waiting for a formal invitation from Qatar to
attend the Doha conference, an unidentified Israeli Foreign Ministry
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Fourth Middle East and North Africa Economic Conference is
scheduled to convene in Qatari capital Doha Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The official said unless Levy receives a formal invitation from
the Qatari foreign minister requesting a one-on-one meeting,
Israel's delegation to the Doha conference would be led by a
lower-ranking official.
</P>
<P>
Levy's decision, which is expected to be announced today or
Friday, is also linked to the projected meeting of Israeli and
Palestinian joint committee chairmen in the West Bank city of
Jericho next Monday, a gathering to be attended by Levy and the
deputy head of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Mahmoud
Abbas, the official added.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Foreign Ministry said earlier that Levy would
attend the opening ceremony of the Doha conference and then
return to Israel to attend the Jericho meeting.
</P>
<P>
Levy apparently has been troubled by the boycott of the
conference by a number of Arab countries, including Egypt, Syria,
Lebanon and Saudi Arabia and by the fact that those announcing
their participation -- Jordan, Kuwait and Oman -- are not sending
their foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Industry and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky would join
the delegation, which also includes dozens of government officials
and businessmen.

<HEADLINE> Iran Against Azerbaijan's Oil Exploitation in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran has lodged a strong
protest to Azerbaijan's unilateral exploitation of oil from the
Cheragh reservoir of the Caspian Sea, Iranian official news agency
IRNA reported today.
</P>
<P>
The protest was made in a letter submitted to the
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan Wenesday, in which Iran said
that Azerbaijan's unilateral exploitation of the mineral resources
in the seabed and the subsoil of the Caspian Sea was unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Azerbaijan formally started its oil
exploitation in the Cheragh reservoir from Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The letter noted that Azerbaijan's decision contravened the
treaties and agreements signed between Iran and the former Soviet
Union during the past decades on exploitation of the mineral
resources in the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
Those agreements are binding on the Republic of Azerbaijan,
one of the republics of the former Soviet Union, in accordance
with the customary norms of international law and the relevant
accords, the letter said.
</P>
<P>
It also warned that the full responsibility for consequences
of such illegal measures and actions, including damage caused to
other coastal states, rest with the states violating the legal
regime of the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
The Caspian Sea is reported to have proven reserves of 16
billion barrels of crude oil and 8.3 trillion cubic meters of
natural gas. During the past years, Azerbaijan signed several
contracts with foreign companies to form a consortium to conduct
oil exploration and exploitation in the Caspian Sea, arousing
sharp criticism from other Caspian Sea states such as Iran.
</P>
<P>
Tehran stressed that a legal regime governing the Caspian Sea
should be reached unanimously by the five littoral states, namely,
Iran, Azerbaijan, Russia, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan.

BAGHDAD, November 13 (Xinhua) -- In defiance of a
U.N. resolution passed Wednesday, Iraq banned Americans today
from taking part in the U.N. arms inspections for the tenth time
running.
</P>
<P>
Five teams of the U.N. Special Commission in charge of
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction in Baghdad headed
this morning for a Baghdad site to carry out their mission, Iraqi
News Agency quoted an Iraqi official source as saying.
</P>
<P>
The source said that as the five teams arrived at the site,
the Iraqis in charge told them that they would be allowed to
enter with the exception of the Americans.
</P>
<P>
The source said that the U.N. inspectors decided to return to
their bases in Baghdad without carrying out any inspection of the
site.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council passed Wednesday unanimously a
resolution condemning Iraq for banning American U.N. arms
inspectors and slapped a ban on travel abroad by Iraqi officials
impeding U.N. arms inspection teams from doing their duties.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Herdsmen Benefit From Cashmere Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Cashmere has become a new means
of improving the lives of Tibetan herdsmen.
</P>
<P>
For the past three years, herdsmen in Ngari Prefecture have
spent 3.84 million yuan on a breeding farm for cashmere production
and now have 376 households in cashmere production raising 70,000
sheep.
</P>
<P>
Last year, cashmere output in Ngari Prefecture was 234 tons and
the average income was 2,500 yuan per household.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan herdsmen have traditionally measured their fortune by
the number of head of cattle, and are now learning new technology
for raising livestock.
</P>
<P>
Gama Tarqin of Rutog County sold 60 head of cattle and bought
180 sheep over the past three years and now has more than 500
sheep, which brought his family more than 30,000 yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
With the profits he was able to buy a truck and tractor to
expand his cashmere business and explains, "I did not get rid of
poverty even though I had more than 300 head of cattle in the
past, but I am better off from cashmere production now."
</P>
<P>
Many herdsmen in Rutog County, like Gama Tarqin, have bought
tractors and trucks, and have built new houses that are furnished
with TV sets, washing machines and sewing machines. And they are
using new technology to expand cashmere production.

<HEADLINE> Li: China to Gradually Open Financial, Service Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 13 (Xinhua) -- China will gradually open its
financial, trade and other service sectors to foreign investors,
Chinese Premier Li Peng said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier made the statement in a speech at a
luncheon hosted in his honor by the Federation of Economic
Organization of Japan.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China will take further measures to perfect its
laws and regulations and protect the rights and interests of
foreign investors, so as to create a better trade and investment
environment.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier, who arrived here Tuesday for a six-day
official good-will visit to Japan, said, "the world is quickening
its step toward multi-polarization. To strengthen economic and
technological cooperation among countries and seek common
development have become an important characteristic in
international relations."
</P>
<P>
Li said his country would firmly carry out its opening-up
policy. By the year 2000, the total trade volume of both import
and export is expected to reach 400 billion U.S. dollars, which
will provide more opportunities for China and other countries to
cooperate in economic and commercial fields.
</P>
<P>
China cut off its average tariffs once again recently
from 23 percent to 17 percent, a fall of 26 percent, nearing the
average level of the developing countries, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li, "next year China will apply preferential
policies to foreign-invested projects which conform to Chinese
industrial policy, especially those of high and new technology and
imports of advanced equipment."
</P>
<P>
"China continues to encourage foreign investments in
agriculture, energy and transportation," Li said.
</P>
<P>
But the Chinese premier said China could not open its stock
market soon nor completely liberalize the exchange of the Chinese
currency to foreign ones, because China is at the stage of moving
from a planned economy to a socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth of China in 1997 is expected to exceed 9
percent and inflation will remain below 2 percent. The Chinese
economy is entering a good period characterized by a faster growth
but a relatively low inflation rate.

<HEADLINE> 30 Journalists to Be Tried over Rwanda Massacre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 13 (Xinhua) -- At least 30 journalists
will be tried by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda
(ICTR) for their involvement in the 1994 genocide.
</P>
<P>
Craig McConaghy, the ICTR Legal Officer, said on Wednesday
that more than 30 journalists are suspected to have participated
in or encouraged the massacre.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian newspaper quoted the official as saying that the
ICTR, based in north Tanzania's Arusa, was holding two radio
journalists and two radio directors.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 26 were being held in Rwanda, allegedly for
participating in the massacre.
</P>
<P>
McConaghy, who is also responsible for investigating the role
of the media in the Rwanda genocide, said no print media
journalists had so far been identified to have been involved in
the genocide, saying "So far, most of the suspected journalists
come from radio stations only."
</P>
<P>
He said the suspects had made announcements aimed at promoting
political propaganda that fueled the massacre.
</P>
<P>
McConaghy is attending the East African Media Workshop with
the theme of "Towards a Strong and Responsible Media in the
Region by the year 2000," organized by the Media Institute of
Southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said the journalists used Radio Television Libre Des Mille
Collines (RTLM) to urge the Hutu extremists to be aware of the
enemies and be prepared to fight a total war when the time came.
</P>
<P>
According to RTLM, the enemy was the Rwanda Patriotic Front
(RPF) and its accomplices who were Tutsis living within Rwanda as
well as moderate Hutus in favor of the democratic process.
</P>
<P>
During the genocide, Radio Rwanda which was used by Hutu
extremists and RTLM, broadcast calls for violence against Tutsi
population whereas RTLM targeted fat bellies for death.
</P>
<P>
Sometimes radio broadcasts even mentioned the names of
individuals being sought, he added.

<HEADLINE> Market for Interior Decoration Booming in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Civilian household interior
decorations have become popular consumer items here, with the
local market climbing to 20 billion yuan a year.
</P>
<P>
More than 200,000 households move into new homes or improve
living conditions each year in Shanghai, according to local
sources. As living standards improve, more and more local
residents are motivated to decorate their homes to drive up demand.
</P>
<P>
An official in charge of construction in Shanghai said that in
past years the average family spent about 50,000 yuan to decorate
an apartment, and a family with better income often spent double
that or more on decorations.
</P>
<P>
Taking 50,000 yuan as an average household expenditure for
interior decoration, the yearly market demand would total 12
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
In addition, redecorating the city's old apartments also will
increase decorative market demands, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The ever-growing market for decorations has advanced the
development of businesses dealing in sanitary utensils, electrical
appliances, building materials and construction.
</P>
<P>
About 300 professional companies specialize in interior
decoration in the city, according to the official.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Urges Japan to Export More High-tech to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng here
today called on Japanese businessmen to provide China with the
most advanced technology and products of the highest quality.
</P>
<P>
Li made the call in a speech at a luncheon hosted in his honor
by the Federation of Economic Organizations of Japan.
</P>
<P>
He said after about two decades of reform and opening up,
China's market has undergone profound changes and Chinese
consumers have greater demand for better products.
</P>
<P>
The premier suggested that Japanese businessman abandon their
old concept about China and grasp the opportunity by making their
capital, technology and service more competitive in the Chinese
market.
</P>
<P>
He urged Japanese businessmen to provide China with their most
advanced technology and brand-name products of the highest
quality, so that they can beat other foreign investors in the
competition.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier said as the biggest developing country in
the world, with rich natural and labor resources, China has an
economy that has gained unprecedented momentum, thus offering a
huge potential market for foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
Japan, as one of the most developed countries, has abundant
funds, advanced technology and rich experience in management, Li
added.
</P>
<P>
The two countries' economies are highly complementary and
therefore cooperation will surely benefit both.
</P>
<P>
There is a broad prospect for this cooperation, Li said. China
is now reforming its state-owned enterprises, a golden chance for
Japanese investors.
</P>
<P>
Li noted the smooth development of bilateral relations shows
that difference in social systems and ideologies should be no
obstacle to economic cooperation. China is opposed to placing
man-made hurdles to cooperation in trade and economy.
</P>
<P>
He said China appreciates the Japanese government's support for
China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral trade between the two neighboring countries,
enormously boosted since the normalization of diplomatic relations
in 1972, has reached 60 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
China is now Japan's second largest trading partner while
Japan, which has been China's biggest trading partner for four
successive years, is China's second largest source of foreign
capital.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Imposes Visa Rule on Britons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
decided to impose visa requirements beginning on November 15 on
all British passport holders entering the country, said Kenyan
immigration department officials.
</P>
<P>
The daily newspaper Times today quoted Immigration
officials as saying that it was in response
to Britain's decision on visas requirements for Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
The British government imposed visa rules on Kenyans on March
7, last year.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the British High Commission to Kenya said
Wednesday that the High Commission was informed of Kenya's
decision on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's Principal Immigration officer Frank Kwinga said,
"It is only fair and diplomatically acceptable
that Britons entering Kenya have visas just like Kenyans entering
Britain are required to have visas."
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Foreign Minister Kalonzo Musyoka said that it was not
in the East African country's interest to reciprocate.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about 100,000 British tourists visit
Kenya each year and Kenya's decision will add the cost of
holidays in Kenya for British citizens.

<HEADLINE> IMF Chief Optimistic on Asian Economic Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 13 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) said here today that Asia will
quickly rebound from its current crisis and be able to return to
high rates of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Michel Camdessus, Managing Director of the IMF, said at a press
conference that the achievements made by Southeast Asian countries
in the past decade were by no means wiped out by the developments
in recent months.
</P>
<P>
The region's long-term fundamentals, including high domestic
savings rates, strong fiscal position, dynamic private sectors and
recent gains in competitiveness, remained basically favorable.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus, who arrived here on Wednesday on a two day visit as
part of his Southeast Asian tour, said that his message to the
countries in the region is: "The crisis is not necessarily a
blight on the future but, more probably, a blessing in disguise".
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, after this period of adjustment, these economies will
emerge stronger than before," he stressed, adding that the turmoil
served as an eye-opener which helped countries in the region to
recognize the weaknesses in their economies.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus said that Southeast Asian countries still have a long
way to go to catch up with the advanced economies. Therefore, "the
potential for growth is there" and, with sound policies, countries
in the region should be able to sustain high rates of growth for
another two decades or more, he pointed out.

HANOI, November 13 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
said here Wednesday that his country will enhance cooperation with
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with Chirac, Vietnamese Communist Party
General-Secretary Do Muoi described Chirac's visit as "an
important event marking a new step of development of the
friendship and comprehensive cooperation between Vietnam and
France."
</P>
<P>
Hoping that France would continue assisting and cooperating
with Vietnam, Do Muoi wanted the French government to help his
country to improve its relations with international financial and
monetary organizations and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Chirac, who arrived here Wednesday morning for an official
visit as well as to attend the seventh Francophone summit in Hanoi
Friday, noted with satisfaction that over the past years,
particularly after the visit to Vietnam in 1993 by late President
Francois Mitterant, the two countries have seen new development in
their political, economic and cultural relations.
</P>
<P>
He added that France is willing to cooperate and share
experience with Vietnam in industry, agriculture, banking,
insurance, administrative reform, education and culture.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also exchanged views on international and
regional issues of common concern, the Vietnam News Agency
reported.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Creditors' Meeting on Zambia Deferred </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- A meeting of Zambia's
creditors scheduled for next month has been postponed because of
the slow pace of privatization in the country's copper mines, the
World Bank has said.
</P>
<P>
The Times of Zambia today quoted World Bank Deputy
Representative in Lusaka, Richard Beardmore, as saying that the
meeting has been put off until next year.
</P>
<P>
The action means that the Zambian government will have to draw
up its 1998 budget without guarantee of aid.
</P>
<P>
One third of the country's 1.1 billion U.S. dollars budget in
1997 was made up by aid.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank is waiting for the privatization of Zambian
Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), Beardmore noted.
</P>
<P>
The country may go through part of 1998 without donor inflows,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank is also waiting for an assessment of the
country's macro-economic performance from the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) before calling the meeting of donors.
</P>
<P>
IMF representative Elwaleed Taha for Zambia said last week
that IMF was pleased with its economic performance over the past
several months.
</P>
<P>
Taha said IMF will resume negotiations with the government on
the country's enhanced structural adjustment facility in
December.
</P>
<P>
The consultative group of creditors traditionally meets in
December to make pledges to Zambia ahead of its announcement of
the annual budget in January.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 the consultative group meeting was deferred
indefinitely after donors cut aid to the country over governance
concerns. Aid has however resumed.

Jointly sponsored by a Hong Kong-based cultural foundation and

(AIRZIM) incurred an operational loss of more than 150 million
Zimbabwe Dollars (12 million U.S. dollars) this year, AIRZIM'S
Chief Executive Officer Brendon Donohoe announced on Wednesday.

Addressing the Bulawayo Publicity Association annual meeting,

staff lost confidence, and the airline was run on a personality

The corporation had introduced new flight schedules designed

</P>
<P>
On the commercialisation, Donohoe said the process was well on
track and expected to be complete by April next year.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Current Account Surplus Reaches $50 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Japan's current account surplus
for the first half of fiscal 1997 is 5,806.0 billion yen (48.98
U.S. billion dollars), or 75.7 percent up from a year earlier, the
Finance Ministry said in a preliminary report today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the rise, the first in eight half-year
periods since April-September 1993, to brisk exports of items such
as automobiles helped by the weak yen against the U.S. dollar and
by favorable economic conditions abroad.
</P>
<P>
In goods and services trading during the April-September
period, Japan produced a surplus of 2,914.4 billion yen (24.5
billion dollars), about 4.5 times the surplus of a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Export growth outpaced the rise in imports in merchandise
trade, while the deficit in services trading shrank from a year
before due partly to the increase in the number of foreigners
visiting Japan, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's surplus in merchandise trade in the April-September
period rose by 52.7 percent from a year earlier to 6,249.3 billion
yen (52.6 billion dollars), the first increase in nine half-year
periods.
</P>
<P>
Exports expanded by 15.6 percent to 24,579.1 billion yen (206.9
billion dollars), rising for the seventh straight half-year
period, while imports advanced by 6.7 percent to 18,329.9 billion
yen (154.3 billion dollars), also up for the seventh successive
half-year period, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
In service trade, including tourism, Japan posted a deficit of
3,334.8 billion yen (28.1 billion dollars), down from a deficit of
3,444.1 billion yen (29.0 billion dollars) a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The current account balance measures the flow of goods and
services as well as investment and other monetary transfers.
</P>
<P>
In September alone, Japan's current account surplus rose by
109.5 percent from a year earlier to 723.4 billion yen (6.1
billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> Travel Agencies Expand, But Profit Margin Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese travel agencies
handling overseas tourists have expanded, but their profit margins
have declined, a survey shows.
</P>
<P>
All the 959 "international travel agencies" operating in 1996
took part in an annual survey conducted by the China National
Tourism Administration.
</P>
<P>
The result of the survey announced recently indicates the gross
business of international travel agencies amounted to 20.2 billion
yuan (about 2.437 billion U.S. dollars) in 1996, a year-to-year
increase of 17.4 percent, while the average was 22.28 million
yuan, a rise of 20.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-three agencies exceeded 100 million yuan each,
accounting for 3.6 percent of the total; and 622 agencies ranged
between 1 million yuan and 22.28 million yuan each, accounting for
68.5 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
"This shows large travel agencies only make up a small portion
of the business in China," a tourist official said.
</P>
<P>
The survey also reveals that the profit margin for travel
agencies stood at 3 percent in 1996, 0.4 percentage point lower
than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
"This shows that with the constant expansion in business scale,
the competition has been getting tougher and tougher, triggering
the need for travel agencies to improve their way of doing
business," said the official.

<HEADLINE> NKP, DP Announce Merger Agreement in SKorea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 13 (Xinhua) -- New Korea Party (NKP) and
Democratic Party (DP) today announced an merger agreement, making
the NKP's Lee Hoi-chang the unified presidential candidate and the
DP's Cho Soon president of the united party.
</P>
<P>
Lee and Cho had agreed last Friday to merge their parties to a
unified party under a name of the Korea Democratic Party or New
Democratic Party, and to share the posts in the new party by the
NKP taking 70 percent and the DP claiming the rest.
</P>
<P>
The merger turns the December 18 presidential election into a
three-way race.
</P>
<P>
As former Seoul mayor Cho Soon, known as an economic expert and
honest administrator, gave up his presidential bid to support the
NKP's Lee Hoi-chang, Lee's lowest popularity is expected to boost.
</P>
<P>
Latest opinion polls, launched by major dailies over the
weekend, showed that Lee has regained over 20 percent support,
still trailing behind unified opposition candidate Kim Dae-jung
with 30 percent, but has narrowed the gap with Rhee In-je' 20 plus
percent.
</P>
<P>
Pollsters attributed Lee's surge in popularity to the merger
and NKP officials expected Lee's popularity to further improve.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference after the merger announcement, Lee
and Cho highlighted their united front against the opposition
alliance between the National Congress for New Politics (NCNP) and
the United Liberal Democrats (ULD) which supports NCNP leader Kim
Dae-jung.
</P>
<P>
They criticized that the opposition coalition is nothing more
than a strategy to extend the politics of the three Kims -
President Kim Young-sam, NCNP's Kim Dae-jung as well as ULD's Kim
Jong-pil who were active in the political stage through the past
three decades.
</P>
<P>
While the former ruling party appeals for the conclusion of the
three Kims era, opposition leading runner Kim Dae-jung appeals for
government transfer and 49-year-old Rhee In-je is asking for a
general innovation.

<P>
SEOUL, November 13 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's rice production
for this year is estimated at 5.45 million tons, the largest since
1990, according to the report from the Agriculture and Forest
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
South Korea produced 5.607 million tons of rice in 1990.
</P>
<P>
In a final tally, the ministry said that this year's production
is 2.4 percent more than last year and 1.8 percent more than the
estimation made on September 15.
</P>
<P>
A ministry official said that the high yield is attributed to
good weather, prevention of harmful insects and diseases, and an
overall increase of farmland.
</P>
<P>
The unit production, which is 505 kilograms per acre in Japan,
averages 518 kilograms per acre in South Korea, the largest in the
country's rice farming history, and more than the record of 507
kilograms posted last year, he added.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Australia produced 635 kilograms of grain per
acre, Egypt 598 kilograms and Greece 583 kilograms, respectively,
in 1996, according to the ministry.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Cotton Collection Exceeds Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Cotton Company of Zimbabwe
(COTTCO), the country's largest ginner and marketer of cotton,said
it has this year collected over 192,000 tonnes of cotton seed,
exceeding its target by nearly 12,000 tonnes.
</P>
<P>
A company spokesman said Wednesday that the 192,738 tonnes of
cotton seed collected represented 96 percent of its ginning
capacity of 200,000 tonnes.
</P>
<P>
''This is a remarkable achievement, particularly against the
backdrop of increased competition. It shows we are still the
market leaders, a position we are confident we will retain,'' the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
COTTCO is one of the first state enterprises to be privatised

<HEADLINE> Province Sets Record for Cotton Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- China's central agricultural
province of Hunan has gathered in a record harvest of cotton this
year with more than 120,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Hybrid cotton technology was credited with the record harvest
by officials with the provincial agricultural department. More
than 106,000 hectares of hybrid cotton were planted, accounting
for half of the province's cotton-growing areas.
</P>
<P>
The per-unit area yield of the hybrid cotton is above 1,500
kilograms, a 12 percent increase over the normal breed.
</P>
<P>
The hybrid cotton raised in the province has been improved
after 20-plus years of efforts by local scientists. The State
Science and Technology Commission has set up a hybrid cotton
breeding center in the province. In addition, the Ministry of
Agriculture has designated the hybrid as a key breed for
nationwide use.
</P>
<P>
The province has promulgated a series of policies to help
farmers grow the high-yield cotton and to guarantee their
enthusiasm in planting it.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that the province's hybrid planting area will reach
150,000 hectares next year.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Over 300,000 people have
taken the new subway in Guangzhou since it opened to traffic four
months ago -- but for sightseeing rather than commuting.
</P>
<P>
As the first section of the subway is still in trial operation,
the five-stop trip takes a full hour to cover. Though the fare for
the short trip is five yuan, which is expensive by Chinese
standards, it is still attractive to tourists who like the
distinctly different feel of traveling underground.
</P>
<P>
To satisfy the travelers' curiosity, the Guangzhou Subway
Company has designated the trial operation as the "sightseeing
period," providing a ten-minute stop at each station for visitors
to take pictures and a non-stop return trip.

<HEADLINE> New Analysis: Currency Worries Test Hong Kong's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's competitiveness,
which is arguably eroded by the high cost of wages and property
prices, is now facing a further challenge in the wake of the Asian
currency turmoil.
</P>
<P>
The city has become relatively expensive for foreign tourists
and overseas importers, as speculative attacks triggered the
depreciation of a string of currencies in the region and left
Hong Kong dollar's peg to the greenback unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Cheaper prices might improve exports, but economists here
warned that devaluation is not the right answer to
competitiveness. "A lower-price strategy will not be sustainable
if it is not matched by real gains in efficiency or productivity,"
said Dr. Chan Wai-kwan, assistant director of the Hong Kong
General Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
"Devaluation for its own sake is not competitiveness," said
Chan," it is beggar-thy-neighbor. If devaluation worked, then
economies would be competing to make their currencies cheaper."
</P>
<P>
A recent economic report by the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation (HSBC) says: "The immediate impact [of the devaluation
of Asian currencies] is not expected to be overly significant."
</P>
<P>
The report argues that there is a limited overlap between Hong
Kong products and that of the other Asian economies, and the
increasing demand for services from the China's inland areas will
partly offset the loss of business opportunities for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Fernow, research head of Vickers Ballas Hong Kong
Limited also stressed the role of services, which now account for
more than 80 percent of Hong Kong's GDP, compared with less than
10 percent for manufacturing. "The issue of competitiveness must
be addressed in consideration of the city's role as one of the
world's leading financial and business centers," he said.
</P>
<P>
He did not think that substantial devaluation would attract
firms to move their headquarters and regional offices into
Southeast Asian countries where still lack the necessary
infrastructure and advanced information technology.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Prof. Y. C. Jao at the School of
Economics and Finance, University of Hong Kong, said: "Hong Kong's
advantage lies in its strong adaptability and high flexibility,
which have helped the city go through many difficult times and
quickly regain its strength over the past decades."
</P>
<P>
In his view, competitiveness should be achieved through raising
productivity, lowering costs, enhancing education, and applying
new technology.
</P>
<P>
High level of property prices has long been a worry for Hong
Kong's competitiveness. Prof. Jao argued that high prices,
determined by the market mechanism, indicate strong demand for
properties in Hong Kong, and the problem should be tackled still
by market forces, namely increasing supply.
</P>
<P>
Actually the interest rate-sensitive property sector has gone
downturn after Hong Kong's primary interest rates were pushed up
to fend off speculators. Prof. Jao said that the adjustment of
property prices, though painful, might be good for the long-term,
healthy development of Hong Kong's economy.

Africa's principal export to the U.S., which accounts for 90
percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
"U.S. direct investment in sub-Saharan Africa, which is
concentrated in petroleum, mining and manufacturing, grew from
3.6 billion dollars in 1995, or by 25 percent," noted Carragher.

products from developing countries, of which Zimbabwe is one of
the largest beneficiaries.

<HEADLINE> NZ to Boost Defense Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand will spend an
extra 663 million NZ dollars (411 million US dollars) over the
next five years, says a Government White Paper on defense released
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The defense boost is aimed to soften critics who charge that NZ
is not contributing enough to the regional security. At present,
NZ spends 1.6 billion NZ dollars (990 million US dollars) a year
on defense.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Paul East said the extra spending provides a
much needed boost to NZ's essential defense requirements.
</P>
<P>
The extra money will be used to increase infantry numbers,
replace their old armored vehicles and buy new transport aircraft.
</P>
<P>
But the government will not buy any more Australian-made ANZAC
frigates. A plan to buy two more such warships has been turned
down by NZ First, the junior partner in the coalition.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand has already bought two ANZAC frigates at a total
cost of one billion NZ dollars (620 million US dollars).

The RBI, the central bank, intervened when the rupee touched

persistent demand for dollars saw the rupee hitting a new low of

DALIAN, Northeastern China, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese
soccer squad, which failed to reach the French World Cup Finals
early this month, on Thursday promised in an open letter to
Chinese fans that they will "wipe off tears and try to catch up
with Asian soccer powerhouses".
</P>
<P>
"We let you down again," said the open letter. "We are
overwhelmed by remorse and self-scolding... We want to say a
sincere 'sorry' to everyone."
</P>
<P>
The letter said that, from China's fifth failed World Cup try,
the team found out that "they knew little about the
rapidly-developing world of soccer and the Chinese team needed
improvements on management, training and quality of the players."
</P>
<P>
"We would thoroughly review our qualifying competition and sum
up the lessons," the letter added.

eleven in a meaningless group match.

<HEADLINE>   Third Sea Port to be Set Up in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is
actively considering to set up the third sea port in the country,
the national news agency BSS reported here today.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed on Wednesday by Finance Minister Shah AMS
Kibria while addressing a seminar titled "Pre-Shipment Inspection
(PSI)" held in Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
"We are considering providing a deep sea port in the country
and further development of Chittagong Port and Mongla Port," the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the government is committed to ensure a free and
steady flow of trade in this South Asian country to boost the
economy rapidly, the minister said that at present the government
is interested in smooth export-import business and proper revenue
collection.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the PSI system, the minister said, "PSI was a
voluntary system, the introduction of the system was a mistake in
Bangladesh context. It was a faulty system, which ultimately
caused a serious loss of government revenue in the past."
</P>
<P>
The minister stated that the government will continue its
present economic policy but would consider all economic suggestion
which would bring good for the country and not only for any group.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Schedules First Town Hall Meeting on Ethnicity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
has scheduled his first town hall meeting on race for December in
Akron, Ohio, and met with aides Wednesday to refocus his national
initiative to promote racial harmony in the country.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, along with Vice President Al Gore, made the
announcement at a meeting in the White House's Cabinet Room with a
half-dozen key aides and several members of his race advisory
board's staff.
</P>
<P>
Akron has took measures to deal with its racial problems. The
White House was impressed with a program called the Coming
Together Project, aimed at promoting awareness of other cultures
through the arts, and with an Akron newspaper's year-long Pulitzer
Prize-winning examination of race.
</P>
<P>
"We think Akron as a community has really stepped up to deal
honestly and openly on race relations," White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
A medium-sized city, Akron is 73 percent white, 24.5 percent
black and 2 percent Asian, Hispanic and American Indian.
</P>
<P>
Since its formation in June, the seven-member race advisory
board, headed by historian John Hope Franklin, has met only twice,
with a third meeting scheduled for next week.
</P>
<P>
Gore identified two areas that need to be addressed, officials
said -- fostering a broader understanding of the "unique
suffering" of minority and ethnic groups and the "unique
contributions" made by these groups.
</P>
<P>
There was also a decision to acknowledge that not all Americans
are struggling with race but are resolving racial problems in
creative ways.
</P>
<P>
The advisory board has posted a list of "promising practices"
on its Internet site, so that local communities can duplicate
those efforts. Akron's Coming Together Project is among them.
</P>
<P>
Other efforts include Cleveland's Residential Housing and
Mortgage Credit Project, which works to identify and address home
mortgage discrimination; PRIDE, an effort in Philadelphia to
promote discussions on race and ethnicity; and Team Harmony, a
Boston program that gets young people of all races involved in
various projects.

<HEADLINE> Vigorous Debate on NATO Expansion Expected in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. administration is
still headed for a vigorous debate on the expansion of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) despite some positive results,
a senior U.S. official said today.
</P>
<P>
"We are just finishing an important and very intensive period
in our efforts to enlarge NATO by adding Poland, Hungary, and the
Czech Republic to the alliance," Jeremy Rosner, special assistant
to the U.S. secretary of state for NATO enlargement ratification
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The Senate has had nine full committee hearings on the
alliance's enlargement over the last 30 days by three different
Senate committees and is expected to vote on it early next year.
</P>
<P>
A majority vote of two-thirds is needed for its ratification.
</P>
<P>
Rosner praised a letter by Chairman Jesse Helms of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee and ranking Democrat Joseph Biden that
gives strong support to the alliance's expansion.
</P>
<P>
"We would certainly agree with those observations, and we view
them as quite significant," Rosner said.
</P>
<P>
"Even so, even with these very positive results and this very
positive letter from the chairman and the ranking member, we think
that we are still headed for a vigorous debate on this issue in
the public and on Capitol Hill,"
</P>
<P>
"We would not yet say that we have the necessary two-thirds
votes in hand, but we see encouraging signs of senators stating
support for this," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"We think there will be a number of amendments, reservations,
conditions, understandings likely to be raised as part of the
process," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the press conference, Deputy Assistant
Secretary of State for European and Canadian Affairs Ronald Asmus
said that the debate is "the most comprehensive debate" in the
U.S. on European security since the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
"We feel quite comfortable and confident that we are coming out
of this debate with that commitment reaffirmed in this country,
and in the leadership and in the population as a whole," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 16-member NATO will convene a ministerial meeting in
December in Brussels to sign the protocols of accession for the
three states.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Trade Gap with India Narrows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh had a trade gap with
India of 37.389 billion taka (834.6 million U.S dollars) in the
1996-97 fiscal year, down by 4.577 billion taka (90.6 million
dollars) compared with the previous fiscal year, the independent
United News of Bangladesh (UNB) reported here today.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed on Wednesday by Bangladeshi Education
Minister ASHK Sadique while replying to a question on foreign
trade in the Parliament in the absence of the commerce ministers.
</P>
<P>
The education minister said the trade gap with India was 41.97
billion taka ( 937 million dollars) during the 1995-96 fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the trade gap to go-slow demand of Bangladeshi
products in the Indian market. "We hope our exports to India would
rise as the result of government initiatives," he added.
</P>
<P>
In a written reply to a written question, Bangladeshi Commerce
Minister Tofail Ahmed said the government has taken a number of
measures to narrow the existing trade gap with the neighboring
country.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the government has attached importance to increasing
exports to the northeastern states of India in an effort to reduce
the gap, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Bangladesh earned export income of 779.2 million
taka (1.74 million dollars) from India during the July-September
period of the current fiscal year, the commerce minister told the
Parliament that no information about imports from India during the
three-month period has been received.

Light of Myanmar today quoted a senior official as saying.
</P>
<P>
U Soe Tha, minister for communications, posts and telegraphs,

radio-telephone system in the country last month, initiating a
total of 3,000 lines at two township stations in the capital of
Yangon.
</P>
<P>
Other communication systems such as digital micro-wave links
have already established in Myanmar since 1995, connecting the
capital of Yangon with nine other cities in the country.
</P>
<P>
An official report said that the local satellite stations
linking Yangon with 14 remote towns have been built and 64 more
ground stations for micro-wave links are under construction in the

BANGKOK, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Asian financial crisis is
forcing ASEAN members to liberalize their financial sector earlier
than the World Trade Organization's required schedule, according
to Krirk-krai Jirapaet, Thai ambassador to the WTO.

ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations) groups
Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines,

accept its economic rescue package to allow foreigners to take
equity in local financial institutions.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Smog Comes to Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Meteorological
Department has confirmed that many parts of the country have been
covered by a thin layer of smog coming from Indonesia over the
past few days.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Director of Meteorology Jayatilleke Banda today said the
smog layer was seen in satellite pictures they received Monday and
was confirmed Wednesday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The cause of this smog is believed to have resulted from the
massive forest fires that erupted in Indonesia some weeks ago, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
He said the lifetime of the smog layer could not be counted.
</P>
<P>
The smog is spreading towards the Maldives and southern India
via Sri Lanka and the Bay of Bengal, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
Heavy smog produced by lasting fires in Indonesia has caused
severe disasters in Singapore, Thailand and other Southeast Asian
countries during the past weeks.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: El Nino Affects Asia's Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Eight months after it began to
hit Asian and Pacific Countries, the El Nino climate phenomenon is
expected to persist until next year and remains a big threat to
agricultural production in the region.
</P>
<P>
El Nino refers to the abnormal warming of sea surface
temperatures in the South Pacific, which erupts every two to seven
years and causes severe flooding and drought.
</P>
<P>
The 1982-1983 El Nino, the worst one in 100 years, caused 13
billion U.S. dollars in damage and killed 2,000 people in the
world.
</P>
<P>
However, experts warned that the current El Nino, which began
in March, could be among the severest in this century.
</P>
<P>
The worst effect will be felt over the next few months and
possibly extend into 1998 -- beyond its usual Christmas time peak,
they said.
</P>
<P>
During the past eight months, El Nino has unleashed severe
drought in parts of the Asian and Pacific region, affecting farm
production in Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines,
Thailand, India, Australia and other countries.
</P>
<P>
In the northern Philippines, rainfall has been below normal
since May, affecting major rice and corn growing areas. The number
of typhoons, which bring significant amounts of rainfall, has been
fewer than normal in the whole country.
</P>
<P>
The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimated that the
country's corn output in 1997-1998 will drop to 3.92 million tons
compared with the 4.22 million tons in the previous marketing
year.
</P>
<P>
Dry conditions in Indonesia would affect 300,000 hectares of
rice fields this year, according to the FAO.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's worst drought in half a century is expected to
continue into 1998, particularly in Southern Sumatra and
Kalimantan, Borneo, Java and eastern parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that Indonesia will have to import at least
300,000 tons of corn in the last quarter of this year to make up
for the shortfall caused by the drought.
</P>
<P>
In Papua New Guinea, about one million people have been hit by
the worst drought in 50 years and face food shortages. The FAO
reported that serious drought in this Pacific state would continue
until next January and possibly next March, and up to 50 percent
of the nation's coffee crop could be wiped out.
</P>
<P>
The most serious problem caused by El Nino is its effects on
the region's food production, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
But they also warned that El Nino will also cause serious water
shortages in some Asian and Pacific countries.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippine capital of Manila, the Metropolitan Water
Works and Sewerage System announced early this week that it will
reduce the water supply starting this month until July next year
due to the El Nino phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
"We have to reduce the supply because the current level of
water in Angat reservoir is now about 18 meters below the normal
level," said a spokesman of the company.
</P>
<P>
Facing a potential food and water crisis, countries in the
region have tried in one way or another to minimize losses caused
by El Nino.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government has allotted 2.2 billion pesos (about
65 million U.S. dollars) to combat the El Nino effects by building
9,000 wells and 20,000 small reservoirs and repairing irrigation
canals.
</P>
<P>
Countries such as Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines have
started importing grains to ensure normal food supplies this year
and next.
</P>
<P>
At an El Nino conference here last week, experts discussed
strategies to cushion the El Nino effects.
</P>
<P>
They urged governments of drought-prone countries to encourage
farmers to diversify crops, plant drought-resistant varieties and
start water conservation programs.
</P>
<P>
Countries prone to flooding should strengthen drainage systems,
dams, canals and sea-walls to reduce the effects of destructive
floods, they suggested.
</P>
<P>
Other participants said that all countries should set up early
warning systems to detect damages to agricultural production and
its impact on food supply.
</P>
<P>
So long as people make better preparations, the El Nino effect
on Asia's agricultural production could be minimized, they said.

OTTAWA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Canada's postal workers withdrew a
strike deadline for midnight today, saying it would present a new offer
to Canada Post.
</P>
<P>
"Based on our decision to break the impasse, we have decided to
withdraw the strike deadline," the Canadian Union of Postal Workers
said this evening.
</P>
<P>
Canada Post said it would examine the union's offer and make a
counter offer.
</P>
<P>
A postal workers' strike has threatened since the talks
between the union and the corporation broke off last weekend.
</P>
<P>
The talks stalled when the two sides disagreed on a
proposed 200 million dollars (140 million U.S.Dollars) reduction in labor
costs and wage increases.
</P>
<P>
The union said the reduction will mean 4,000 jobs lost, while the
corporation insisted no one will lose their job because work rules can
be adjusted to save money.
</P>
<P>
The union is asking for wage increases of more than eight percent
over 18 months, while Canada Post is offering increases of three
percent over two years.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are so far apart they need the threat of a strike or
lockout to reach an agreement, according to the conciliator appointed
to help settle the labour dispute.

<P>
MOSCOW, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian parliamentary leaders
said here today that President Boris Yeltsin's just-finished China
visit will further Russia-China ties to a higher level.
</P>
<P>
In a joint press conference, Vladimir Ryzhkov, first deputy
speaker of the Russian State Duma, and Vasily Likhachev, deputy
speaker of the Federation Council, expressed satisfaction with the
Russia-China summit, which ended Tuesday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The two deputy speakers were members of Yeltsin's entourage on
his China trip.
</P>
<P>
Ryzhkov said Russia-China relations enjoy priority in Russian
foreign policies. There were not any political disputes between
Russia and China, and the Russia-China border issue had been
settled once and for all, he said.
</P>
<P>
The first State Duma speaker said Russia and China should
expand trade cooperation in a bid to push the bilateral trade
turnover to 20 billion U.S. dollars in the year 2,000.
</P>
<P>
Likhachev said Russian and Chinese leaders have already started
forging bilateral and international relations oriented to the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
He said the upper house adopted a positive attitude toward
cooperation between Russia and China.
</P>
<P>
During Yeltsin's November 9-11 China tour, the two sides signed
a series of agreements to enhance bilateral trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Chinese President Jiang Zemin also declared that
the surveying and marking of the eastern border between the two

Speaking after the cabinet session on the budget, government
spokesman Dimitris Reppas said the budget is "consistent,
efficient, growth-oriented and equitable."
</P>
<P>
Noting that it would help reach targets set by the Greek
government for joining the European Union's Economic and Monetary
Union (EMU), he said the package represents a continuation of the
1997 budget.
</P>
<P>
Greece plans to enter the EMU by 2001 but will keep the Drachma
out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) before joining the EU's
single currency.
</P>
<P>
Greek Finance Minister Yiannos Papantoniou said today that the
budget also aims to keep the deficit at 2.4 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Under the budget, consumer price inflation, currently 4.7
percent, will fall to 2.5 percent by the end of 1998, and
unemployment, now 9.7 percent, to 9.2 percent, while GDP growth
rate will go up from the present 3.5 percent to 3.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Innovations in the budget are the introduction of an inflation-
linked tax scale of up to 5.7 percent, and a new flexible tax on
mobile phones to be determined by use.
</P>
<P>
The budget also supports the young unemployed by planning to
create 200,000 jobs by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government will speed up its privatization program by
abolishing or merging 1,750 public sector agencies in order to
increase revenue and cut spending.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Calls For Peaceful Settlement of Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Concerned about developments
in Iraq, Indonesia urged all parties involved to exercise
self-restraint and immediately end their conflicts to avoid a
possible recurrence of the Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
"We (Indonesia) do not want to see a war again in the region or
arms being used like several years ago," Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said increasing sanctions on Iraq was not the answer to the
problem but would even complicate the situation, adding that the
sanction imposed so far had not met any target or fulfilled the
hopes but had caused grief among the civilian population,
including women, children and old people.
</P>
<P>
"So I think increasing sanctions is not the way out although I
admit that the problem is complicated," officials at the Foreign
Ministry today quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said Indonesia hoped Iraq would meet its obligations in
line with the UN resolution as its defiance would only be used by
other countries to take actions against it.
</P>
<P>
The United States has continued to ask the UN Security Council
to impose a new sanction to make Iraq willing to accept the UN
weapon inspectors to take a close look at the country's weapon
system.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has banned U.S. weapon inspectors from entering into Iraq.
The United States has not ruled out the use of military forces in
retaliation.

<HEADLINE> El Nino to Blame for Food Shortage: FAO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 12 (Xinhua) -- El Nino, the adverse weather
phenomenon that brings disasters to many countries, is to be
blamed for the increasingly chronic global food shortage, a food
report said today.
</P>
<P>
The report, released by the Rome-based United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO), said: "Although in developing
countries, cereal production in 1997 is forecast to decline only
slightly from last year's good level, the number of countries
facing food emergencies in 1997 has increased to 29, compared to
25 in 1996."
</P>
<P>
A FAO expert said the increase was "a most disturbing trend and
must be reversed to comply with the commitments and objectives of
the world food summit".
</P>
<P>
El Nino can affect food production in different ways.
</P>
<P>
Large stretches of crop field can be devastated by strong winds
or damaging floods, the report said..
</P>
<P>
In Southern Africa, "there is considerable concern over the
possible adverse effect of El Nino on the 1998 coarse grain
crop. Experts predict a strong possibility of poor rainfall for
the planting season which is soon to start."
</P>
<P>
In many Asian countries, El Nino "could lead to a delay in
re-planting, resulting in a switch to early maturing but lower
yielding varieties", the report said.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Port Seeks More Business from China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 13 (Xinhua) -- A visiting Japanese
delegation has expressed the hope that more Chinese ships would
call Oita, an emerging Japanese port.
</P>
<P>
The chief attraction of the port of Oita, located in the
northern part of Kyushu, Japan, lies in its new container
terminal, according to Tatewaki Masato, deputy governor of Oita
Prefecture, who heads the delegation.
</P>
<P>
The port's Ozai Container Terminal, completed in November last
year, has two berths so far. One of them has a water depth of 14
meters and is able to accommodate 50,000-ton ships. And the
terminal's stack yard has space for 4,755 standard containers, the
largest in Kyushu. In 1996, the port of Oita handled 53 million
tons of cargo, according to Mr. Masato.
</P>
<P>
"The port of Oita operates 24 hours a day all the year round
and charges low fees. We hope more Chinese ships would use it,"
Masato said at a get-together with Shanghai port officials held at
the New Jingjiang Hotel here yesterday evening.
</P>
<P>
A shipping route with two monthly sailings has connected Oita
with Shanghai since last July, according to Mr. Masato.
</P>
<P>
The 18-member Japanese delegation has visited harbors, the
Waigaoqiao Container Terminal and the Suzhou New and High-Tech
Development Zone, among others. members said they were favorably
impressed by what they had seen.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Italy to Begin 40-hour Work Week 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rome, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Italy's major trade unions and
employers association, the Confindustria, reached an agreement here
today on reducing the work week to 40 hours, as demanded by the
European Union directives.
</P>
<P>
The accord, reached after 17 months of negotiations, officially
abrogates the 1923 regulation fixing the legal work week at 48
hours.
</P>
<P>
It also fixes vacation time at four weeks, sets limits on
overtime and regulates overnight work.
</P>
<P>
Walter Cerfeda, a trade union official, said the agreement will
make it easier to achieve a 35-hour working week, though "there
was an enormous difference between 48 and 35 hours."
</P>
<P>
Recent debate has focused on the government's commitment to
reducing the work week by law to 35 hours by the year 2001, in an
attempt to boost employment.
</P>
<P>
The commitment is the result of last month's compromise between
the government and the Communist Refoundation in order to avoid
political crisis over the 1998 budget draft.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, expected to be signed next week, should be
converted into a decree by the government at the beginning of next
year.

<HEADLINE> China Revises Seismic Code for Buildings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- China is revising its national
code for the seismic design of buildings in a bid to help
disseminate the experience and expertise in resistance to
earthquakes accumulated during the past decade.
</P>
<P>
"We embarked on the revision of the National Code for the
Seismic Design of Buildings (GBJ11-89) in September, with support
from the Ministry of Construction," Wang Yayong, a senior
anti-earthquake expert, was quoted by today's China Daily as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark GBJ11-89 code, laid down in 1989, has played a
significant role in minimizing losses caused by earthquakes, said
Wang, also director of the Institute of Earthquake Engineering
under the ministry-affiliated China Academy of Building Research.
</P>
<P>
In the 1996 tremors in Lijiang in southwest China's Yunnan
Province, three hospitals which were constructed according to the
code requirements did not collapse.
</P>
<P>
Since 1989, the number of buildings constructed with new
materials and using new construction methods has increased in
China.
</P>
<P>
China has made strenuous efforts in earthquake resistance,
particularly in enabling public and civil buildings to withstand
earthquakes measuring up to six on the Richter Scale.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1989 code was promulgated, the country has devised
and applied leading-edge quake-fighting techniques, including
rubber base-isolator, energy dissipation and structural control,
according to Wang.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States has decided
not to charge compensatory duties for alleged subsidies for
Chilean salmon, Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said his government "is satisfied with the
decision because this proves the assertion we have always made --
Chile does not give subsidies."
</P>
<P>
He said the success of the industry is all to the merit of the
private sector, without any kind of help from the government.
</P>
<P>
"Our country will continue its cooperation with the U.S.
Department of Commerce to allow it to verify and confirm its
decision," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government had accused Chile's salmon producers of
being able to dump their products because of state subsidies
received. It threatened to impose extra-tariffs and duties on
Chilean shipments of the product.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine's 1997 GDP Shrinks Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's Finance Minister, Igor
Mityukov, said here today that the government's wishful estimate
of a 0.3-percent gross domestic product (GDP) growth for 1997 will
certainly fall flat.
</P>
<P>
The real GDP in the first nine months of this year dropped by
five percent compared with the same period of 1996, he said in an
explanation to the parliament about the draft 1998 budget.
</P>
<P>
He added that the state would have an income of 18.5 billion
gryvnas (14.7 billion dollars) predicted by the 1997 budget.
</P>
<P>
The failure to meet the GDP target was caused by the 2.4
percent decline in industrial production in 1997, the finance
minister explained.
</P>
<P>
Mityukov said the failure to meet the estimate was also caused
by unpaid taxes. The state budget had lost 113 million gryvnas
(60.4 million dollars) in unpaid value-added taxes (VAT), and 86
million gryvnas (about 46 million dollars) in unpaid income tax.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the draft 1998 budget which is currently under
debate in the parliament, forecasts revenues of 28.8 billion
gryvnas (15.4 billion dollars), 1.4 billion gryvnas(749 million
dollars) more than the present budget.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the 1.4 billion gryvnas will come from
heavier taxes and excise.

<HEADLINE> Car Sales Continue to Drop in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Largely due to the current
currency crisis, car sales in the Philippines fell 10.7 percent to
65,937 units during the last ten months this year from the
year-ago figures, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Citing figures from the Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers of
the Philippines Inc. (CAMPI), the reports said that for the month
of October alone, car sales slumped 39.9 percent, the largest
decline this year, to 4,762 units compared with the year-ago level
of 7,925 units.
</P>
<P>
CAMPI attributed weaker sales during the period to higher
interest rates and the de facto devaluation of the Philippine
peso.
</P>
<P>
Car assemblers were quoted as saying that their dealers were
informing them many customers with already approved retail
financing withdrew their application because of high interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
Monthly car sales have been on the decline since July when the
Central Bank allowed the floatation of the peso. The peso has so
far depreciated nearly 27 percent against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Also contributing to the decline was the slow processing and
selective approval of banks and other financing institutions and
the increased down-payment requirements, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Four Billion Yuan Investment In East China Embankment Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu province
plans to put four billion yuan into dyke and dam construction over
the next three to five years.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu has more than 1,500 km of river and port embankments
and a nearly 1,000 km coastline.
</P>
<P>
The province has more than 300 large and medium-sized
enterprises along the Yangtze river, but floods and other natural
disasters often hit the area. After one typhoon this year, the
province reported 310 km of embankment damage and six million
cu.m. of earth and stone lost, meaning economic losses of 530
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government decided to take steps to raise the
flood-prevention level to the kind of flood that occurs only once
in fifty years, over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
From 1998 to 2000, the province will arrange 200 million yuan
in loans every year for its embankment project, and most of the
money will come from cities and counties, sources said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the money will be used for dykes and dams, the
provincial government said, and a special provincial-level group
will be set up to take charge of the work.

not up appreciably, even though tariffs on these goods have been
reduced by a relatively wide margin.

MOSCOW, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian champion CSKA Moscow
reapt its home victory over Olympiakos, forcing the latter to

</P>
<P>
The Russian cagers stunned the visiting Greek nationals 77-58.

Olympiakos's powerful attack, and Lithuanian Arturas Karnisovas,

points.

<HEADLINE> Government Stimulating Underground Facilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- China will be digging deep to
expand living and production facilities beneath its crowded
cities, according to sources with a news conference hosted by
Chinese Ministry of Construction.
</P>
<P>
Chinese officials are implementing the nation's first
regulations, entitled "China Urban Underground Space Development
and Management Regulations", regarding development and management
of urban underground space.
</P>
<P>
Ye Rutang, Vice-minister of construction, said at the
conference held Wednesday: "Making use of urban underground space
is a strategic option China adopts to maintain sustainable
development in the upcoming century."
</P>
<P>
Chinese cities, undergoing rapid growth, have experienced
"urban symptoms", namely shrinking construction land, a
deteriorating environment, traffic congestion and aging
infrastructure, Ye said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's figures suggest that China's urbanization rate
will rise to 45 percent by 2010, when 630 million people will be
living in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Ye pointed out that exploiting underground space is an obvious
solution to relieve the "symptoms".
</P>
<P>
Urban underground space, deemed by the United Nations in 1981
to be an important natural resource, refers to the subterranean
areas of a city's planned zones.
</P>
<P>
The minister said: "Developing the underground will not only
substantially ease the shortage of land for construction, but also
contribute to improvement and protection of historical relics."
</P>
<P>
In addition, underground buildings and facilities are not
susceptible to air raids and earthquakes, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
China has already benefited from underground projects,
especially raid shelters, which have been dug throughout the
country in past decades.

<P>
MANAGUA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- A Central American security
pact began to take effect as Nicaragua, the last one, signed it
today.
</P>
<P>
The Armed Forces Conference of Central America (CFAC) had been
signed by presidents of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador in
their respective capitals.
</P>
<P>
The pact said "its objective is making a steady effort to
achieve a strong integration and cooperation of armed forces" of
the Central American countries for overturning eventual attacks
against the sovereignty of the region.
</P>
<P>
Joaquin Cuadra, military chief of Nicaragua, said "the CFAC is
not a new offensive military alliance that gets us to old models
--like the extinct Central American Security Council established
in 1969-- that history has left behind."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the CFAC is an institution compatible with the
new challenges and demands of the upstart Central American
democracy, in search of the welfare and stability of the people
and nations of the region.

<HEADLINE> Artists Perform on Ukraine's Political Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian parties have drafted
several singers, poets and other celebrities on their tickets in a
bid to win votes in the next parliamentary elections, scheduled
for March 29 and 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Gregory Surkis, owner of the famous Dynamo Kiev soccer club,
will run for the Social Democrat Rukh party, while the nationalist
democratic Rukh party has placed poet Ivan Drach and singer Nina
Matvienko the fourth and eight respectively on its list of 225
candidates.
</P>
<P>
The Gromada party, led by ex-Prime minister Pavel Lazarenko,
has singer Dmytro Gnatyuk in the fourth slot, and the Christian
Democrats list poet Yury Demydenko the fifth.
</P>
<P>
Not everyone welcomes the trend. "Making parliament members
out of artists and poets is like nominating politicians for
literature awards," said Sergy Odarych, head of the Ukrainian
Perspective think tank.
</P>
<P>
Party officials disagreed, arguing that everyone is entitled to
run for office. "It does not matter what people are, what they
will do in parliament is the important thing," said Drach.
</P>
<P>
"Nina Matvienko is a great patriot who sings the Ukrainian idea
all over the world," said Viacheslav Koval, head of the Rukh
secretariat.
</P>
<P>
Poet Demydenko said artists are still under-represented on
party list. "I'm generally against artistic people becoming
lawmakers. But there are so few people who protect people's
souls, culture and spirituality," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mykola Mykhalchenko, spokesman of the Christian Democratic
party, fell in with Demydenko's views. He said the primary reason
for including the poet on the ticket was to get someone

<HEADLINE> Central Bank Issues Regulation on Assets Supervision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China
(PBC) will strengthen its control over the wholly state-owned
commercial banks by appointing a board of supervisors to oversee
the quality, preservation and development of their assets.
</P>
<P>
According to a regulation issued by the PBC Wednesday, the
board is expected to provide a further line of defense against
financial risks, and will be significant to the improvement of
the commercial banks' operation and asset quality.
</P>
<P>
Yang Kaisheng, vice president of the Industrial and Commercial
Bank of China (ICBC) said he believed that the board of
supervisors would not hamper the commercial banks' operational
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
The performance of the four state-owned banks -- ICBC, Bank of
China, China Construction Bank and Agricultural Bank of China -- is
at present overseen by the supervisory departments in the PBC, the
central bank, and the commercial banks themselves.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulation, the major responsibilities of the
board will include: checking the financial reports provided by the
wholly state-owned commercial banks, supervising and assessing the
quality of the banks' credit assets, management of the asset
liability ratio and preservation and development of state-invested
property, examining and appraising the performance of the board
directors and bank presidents.
</P>
<P>
Insiders said the regulation has been published at a time when
the country is stepping up its campaign against financial risks
and to improve the performance of state-owned banks.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Tourism authorities in
Shanghai have done a lot to improve the city's tourism sector in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
A recent on-the-spot survey by the Municipal Social-Economic
Investigation Team showed that the effort has paid off, with 80
percent of the tourists coming from other parts of China
questioned expressing satisfaction with the city's services and
facilities.
</P>
<P>
The 16,500 people questioned, who came from other parts of the
country, said that famous bands are a popular item. Most tourists
come to Shanghai for shopping and spend 1,090 yuan per person.
</P>
<P>
Some people complained about the inconvenient transportation,
expensive tickets at tourist spots, and rather ordinary souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
Experts consider Shanghai to be a good tourist market in the
Asia-Pacific region and one with great potential.

<P>
PARIS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- France defeated Scotland 2-1 in
a soccer friendly match in St. Etienne on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have already secured their berths in the World Cup
finals with France as host and Scotland as the best second-placer
in the nine European groups.
</P>
<P>
After a number of opportunities squandered, France opened the
account with a pass by Lilian Thuram. As Scottish goalie Neil
Sullivan fell, Pierre Laigle surged ahead to kick home the first.
</P>
<P>
Within a minute, Scotland's Gordon Durie scored the equaliser
through two French defenders into the net.
</P>
<P>
After the break, France regained its upperhands in the 67th
minute when Laigle was roughly fouled. Youri Djorkaeff, who came
in the second half as a substitute, scored to make it 2-1.
</P>
<P>
It was the second victory in a row for France against a World
Cup bond team. France rallied to win over South Africa 2-1 last
month.

<HEADLINE> Albright: U.S. Lead in Building Peace in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States should
play a leading role in building peace in Europe though it can not
and should not bear the burden of keeping peace alone, said U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Joint Armed Services Officers' Wives Meeting,
Albright stressed that building peace in Bosnia is "a
multinational, multi-faceted enterprise with military and numerous
civilian elements."
</P>
<P>
"Now there are those who say that Bosnia is Europe's problem
and that America has no stake. But history teaches us that there
is no natural political or geographic end point to violence in the
Balkans," she noted.
</P>
<P>
However, she noted that the U.S. allies should contribute to
the peace-building.
</P>
<P>
"America neither can nor should bear the burden of building
peace in Bosnia alone -- nor are we. We have more than two dozen
partners," she said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration has vowed to continue to have a
military presence in Bosnia after the current mandate of the
NATO-led peacekeeping force expires in June next year.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, Secretary of Defense William Cohen said that
the U.S. will pull all its some 8,000 troops out of Bosnia by the
deadline and the Europeans should take up the peace-keeping
mission.
</P>
<P>
"But as NATO's leader, we cannot walk away from a challenge
NATO has accepted. We have made a commitment, which we should
keep, to assist and persist in the healing process," Albright
said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar Rallies Against Japanese yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar on Wednesday
surged past 126 yen for the first time in more than six months on
concerns about a recovery in the Japanese economy.
</P>
<P>
The U.S currency also rose against the German mark. But some of
that rise was trimmed by speculation that Germany may raise
interest rates before the United States does.
</P>
<P>
In late New York trading, the dollar settled at 126.32 yen, up
from 125.03 late Tuesday. It was the first time it had surpassed
the 126 level since May 5. The dollar settled at 1.7183 marks, up
from 1.7077 marks.
</P>
<P>
Also lifting the dollar against the yen was continued turmoil in
Asian financial markets. Hong Kong shares fell 4 percent Wednesday
and Tokyo's Nikkei Stock Average dropped 2.73 percent, falling to
its lowest close since July 1995.
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose against the mark, supported by the strong U.S.
economy against Germany's economic climate. Traders speculated
that Germany may soon raise interest rates to give a push to its
economy. The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday left short-term
interest rates unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The British pound was quoted at 1.7033 U.S. dollars, down from
1.7044 U.S. dollars late Tuesday.

1.3927 Swiss francs, up from 1.3893; 5.7564 French francs, up from

<HEADLINE> Security Tightened at Trial on CIA Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Following the killing of
four Americans in Pakistan, the executive of the Fairfax County
near Washington, D.C. today warned the county's employees of
safety risks due to the capital murder conviction of Mir Aimal
Kasi.
</P>
<P>
County Executive Robert O'Neill Jr. asked employees to be aware
of suspicious packages or events around him, and that he "may find
it necessary to institute a higher level of security" at selected
county buildings.
</P>
<P>
Security is already tight at the courthouse where a jury is
determining the fate of Kasi, who was convicted of killing and
wounding Central Intelligence Agency agents in 1993.
</P>
<P>
A Fairfax County jury declared on Monday that the Pakistan-born
Kasi was convicted in the 1993 deaths of two CIA employees and
wounding of three others. The jury is now hearing testimony to
determine if Kasi will spend life in prison or be executed.
</P>
<P>
Bomb-sniffing dogs patrolled the grounds around the Judicial
Center where the trial was held. Hundreds of large concrete
planters are positioned on many service roads to protect against
unauthorized cars.
</P>
<P>
A large mechanical roadblock is put near the Fairfax County
Circuit courthouse, where guards have cordoned off most parking
spots.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the State Department warned Americans abroad to be
on alert for possible retaliation against Kasi's guilty verdict.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Judge J. Howe Brown ordered that the names and
addresses of the jury be sealed permanently.

<HEADLINE> Military Action Against Iraq not Ruled out, Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Wednesday hailed a unanimous approval by the U.N. Security Council
of condemning Iraq and warned military action still was an option
if Iraqi President Saddam Hussein continues to bar Americans from
taking part in U.N. weapons inspection teams' work.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said the unanimous vote
reflected determination to get Iraq to comply with the U.N.
resolutions. "Any sign that they are not ready to comply will be
read for what it is ... an act of defiance and an act that
requires further measures," he added.
</P>
<P>
The resolution passed by the Security Council condemned Iraq
for its Oct.29 order to expel American weapons inspectors from
the country and demanded the order be rescinded immediately and
unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also imposed a travel ban on Iraqi officials
who interfere with U.N. inspections and suspended further
Security Council reviews of economic sanctions on Iraq until the
weapons inspectors certify that Baghdad is cooperating with
them.
</P>
<P>
The resolution warned of "further measures" against Iraq if it
refuses to comply but does not include an unequivocal threat to
use military force.
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said
Washington had not ruled out military responses to Iraq's any
further defiance.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the Security Council's vote, Iraqi Deputy
Prime Minister Tareq Aziz said in New York that Baghdad would
neither back down nor rescind its order to expel the American
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq will continue to explain its just case and this
resolution will not scare it," Aziz said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
In response, McCurry said: "that would be a very serious
breach of Iraq's obligation to the international community."

<HEADLINE> Qin: China Supports Full Implementation of UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Qin Huasun, Chinese
Permanent Representative to the United Nations, stressed here
today that China always supports the inspection work of the United
Nations Special Commission in charge of scrapping Iraq's chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons, and has made constructive efforts
for the full implementation of the relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador made the remarks at the consultation of
the U.N. Security Council on the crisis of arms inspections in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Qin, who is also the current rotating chairman of the 15-member
Security Council, said that China is deeply concerned at the
development of the crisis and backs the consistent efforts made by
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan and parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
The crisis came after Iraq decided on October 29 to expel
Americans working in the U.N. inspection team from the country and
later threatening to shoot down American U-2 planes supporting the
U.N. inspection operations in the region.
</P>
<P>
Qin said he believes that the relevant resolutions on Iraq
adopted after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 should be fully
and seriously implemented.
</P>
<P>
China has once and again called on Iraq to resume cooperation
with the United Nations and fully fulfil its obligations, Qin
noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China always believes that the sovereignty,
territorial integrity and Iraq's reasonable concerns about its
security should also be respected, and the progress which Iraq has
been made in its cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission in
the past few years should get a just and objective acknowledgment,
the Chinese ambassador added.
</P>
<P>
Qin said that the reasons for the current crisis are
complicated and multiple.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council should hear the opinions of both the U.N.
Special Commission and Iraq on the arms inspections, which began
after the Gulf War in 1991, in order to get a objective and
proper judegement on the inspections, Qin said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that problems arising in the weapons inspections
should be resolved through dialogue and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We are against use of forces and threat of using forces which
would only lead further escalation of the tensions," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We do hope that all parties concerned should exercise
restraint, resolve the problems through dialogue and cooperation
and avoid escalation of the disputes, especially avoid armed
conflicts," Qin added.
</P>
<P>
Qin said that seeking a solution to the crisis, a pressing
matter of the moment is to keep diplomatic efforts and
promote the cooperation between Iraq and the U.N. Special
Commission instead of making the problems more complicated and
adding difficulty to the solutions.
</P>
<P>
Qin expressed the hope that the resolution unanimously passed
at the Security Council on Iraq today would help a proper
resolution of the problem.
</P>
<P>
In order to promote the solution, China voted for the
resolution cosponsored by the United States, Britain and some
other nations, he explained.
</P>
<P>
But the Chinese ambassador noted that the voting did not
indicate any change of the Chinese positions on the U.N.
sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Study Finds Cholesterol-lowering Drugs Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Cholesterol-lowering drugs
can help even healthy middle-aged people with ordinary cholesterol
levels and reduce their risk of heart diseases by more than one-third,
said a U.S. study released today.
</P>
<P>
The results of the study, conducted on 6,605 people, were
released by Dr. Antonio Gotto, dean of Cornell University Medical
College, at a meeting of the American Heart Association in
Orlando, Florida.
</P>
<P>
The study looked at the use of these drugs among men and women,
mostly in their 40s, 50s and 60s, whose total cholesterol levels
were around 220, which is considered somewhat higher than ideal
but is average for American adults.
</P>
<P>
Researchers were quoted by the Associated Press as saying that
the findings mean that cholesterol medicines should be considered
for an additional eight million Americans who until now would not
have been thought to need this treatment.
</P>
<P>
The study is the latest to show the power of a 10-year-old
class of medicines called statins to protect the heart by lowering
cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
Until now, the drugs have been reserved largely for people with
significantly elevated cholesterol or those who clearly have heart
disease already.
</P>
<P>
The study was conducted at Lackland Air Force Base in San
Antonio and the University of North Texas Health Sciences Center
in Fort Worth on men and women who are considered very healthy and
at low risk for heart problems.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Disappointed at Egypt's Boycott of Doha Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- the United States on
Wednesday expressed disappointment over Egypt for its boycotting a
Middle East and North Africa economic conference in protest of
Israel's negative position on peace negotiations with the
Palestinians, syrians and lebanese.
</P>
<P>
Egypt made the announcement of boycott to the economic
conference scheduled on Sunday in Doha, the capital of Qatar, on
Tuesday because of Israel's refusal to move forward in its peace
talks with Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
President Hosni Mubarak recently described as "meaningless" the
conference, which is aimed at develop economic cooperations
between Arab nations and Israel as a means to keep a loose
coalition intact, formed during the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
"The aim of an economic conference is to build cooperation
between Israel and the Arab community, and this is linked to
progress towards peace. But so far no progress at all has been
achieved," Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
Responding to Egypt's boycott, U.S. State Department spokesman
James Rubin said: "We are disappointed with this decision by the

Rubin said there were only four Arab nations -- Jordan,
