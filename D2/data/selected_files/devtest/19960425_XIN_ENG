<HEADLINE> Cambodian Prime Ministers Reiterate "One China" Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's two prime ministers
reiterated today the country's "one China" policy during a meeting
here with top Chinese military official Zhang Wannian.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting with Zhang, who is vice-chairman of China's
Central Military Commission, First Prime Minister Norodom
Ranariddh said that King Norodom Sihanouk had clearly indicated in
Singapore recently that he and his government recognize only "one
China" -- the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
The King also said that China and the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea are friends of Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh praised Zhang's visit to Cambodia, saying it will
enhance mutual understanding and promote cooperation between the
two countries and the two armies.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that as friends of the Cambodian people, the Chinese
were glad to see the economic and diplomatic achievements made by
the royal government since its establishment in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, whom Zhang met this morning,
also stressed that Cambodia regarded the Taiwan issue as part of
China's internal affairs and abided by the "one China" policy.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen added that he hoped to further economic ties between
the two Asian neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Zhang and his entourage arrived here Monday for a four-day
official visit.

<HEADLINE> Israel Assures Cyprus on Israeli-Turkish Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Israel has assured the Cyprus
government that the Turco-Israeli military agreement does not
affect the island or its security.
</P>
<P>
The assurances were conveyed through Israeli replies to a
series of questions which the Cypriot ambassador to Tel Aviv,
Petros Efthchiou, submitted to the Israeli foreign minister
recently, according to government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, the spokesman said the
military agreement between Israel and Turkey carries "limited
clout" since it mainly concerns trade of military equipment and
training.
</P>
<P>
"As far as Cyprus is concerned, the situation has not changed
since the joint defense dogma between Cyprus and Greece
progresses as planned, and Israel remains a friendly country,"
Cassoulides said.
</P>
<P>
He also explained that the Turkish-Israeli agreement provides
for the training of Israeli pilots in Turkey, for cooperation of
the military industries of the two countries and the upgrading of
Turkey's "Fantom" fighters. The two countries have also agreed to
hold a military dialogue twice a year.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides also said that the Cyprus government has been
briefed on the Greco-Israeli agreement which carries, as he said,
"greater weight" since it provides for joint military exercises
as well as cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus will provide facilities to countries which have signed
agreements with Greece, the spokesman added, stressing that the
formal procedures of submitting applications for the use of the
Cyprus Republic are not to be abolished.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot politicians and the press circles have expressed fears
that the Israeli-Turkish defense agreement would harm Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey militarily
intervened following a short-lived coup by some Greek Cypriots
seeking union with Greece. More than 30,000 Turkish troops still
occupy the northern third of the island.

<HEADLINE> HK Delegation in Basel to Return with Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A Hong Kong delegation of 245
companies currently in Basel, Switzerland, for the World Watch,
Clock and Jewelry Show will return with better than expected
results after the fair ends tomorrow, the Hong Kong Trade
Development Council (TDC) said here today.
</P>
<P>
According to a TDC news release issued here today, industrial
leaders from both the watch and clock sector and the jewelry trade
in the delegation, under the auspices of the TDC, have expressed
optimism over business prospects this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Bob Chong, chairman of the TDC Watch and Clock
Advisory Committee, companies selling medium price range products
were happy with the orders.
</P>
<P>
"There were more American buyers this year and we have had a
good number of serious inquiries, more than in 1995," said Chong,
who is a director of Chung Nam Watch Company Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong watch and clock makers brought to this year's fair a
number of trendy items and new ideas and designs such as watches
measuring body temperature.
</P>
<P>
Jewelry manufacturers have produced some simple items for young
working women, while the higher price range products featured
gem-set jewelry with diamonds and 14k to 18k gold.
</P>
<P>
Michael Sze, the newly-appointed TDC executive director who
visited the Basel Fair last week for the first time, said he was
impressed with the fair and in particular, the Hong Kong Pavilion,
which is the fourth largest delegation at Basel.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is one of the world's leaders in the trade and this
is the largest pavilion that the TDC organizes at any trade fair
outside Hong Kong," he said. "The business mood is very positive
as the European economic outlook is improving," he added.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, a total of 21.45 billion HK dollars worth of orders
were placed, compared to the previous year's figure of 18.33
billion.
</P>
<P>
And the buyers seemed quite happy with Hong Kong products and
eager to do business now.
</P>
<P>
"Having been a customer for nearly 15 years, we can say the
quality has substantially improved," said Alfred Emdon, a South
African businessman.
</P>
<P>
"We like the fact that Hong Kong companies can produce models
right after our own specifications at a good price, so they are
very competitive in Spain," said Spanish businessman Pilar
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong-based watches, clocks and jewelry are competitive in
price, design and quality and they add to the fashion statement of
our overseas consumers," said Sze.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM Holds Talks With Greek Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Egyptian Foreign Minister
Amr Moussa today held separate talks with Greek Foreign Minister
Theodoros Pangalos, Defense Minister Gerassimos Arsenis and Greek
President Kostis Stephanopoulos on bilateral relations and
regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Moussa's talks with Pangalos lasted 90 minutes and focused on
bilateral issues and the situation in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on recent developments in the Middle East and
southern Lebanon in particular, Moussa said they evidenced "the
failure of the peace agreement." He also expressed Cairo's
displeasure over a recent Turkish-Israeli military cooperation
accord.
</P>
<P>
"We disagree with the creation of axes in a sensitive region
where we are trying to attain peace," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos echoed Moussa's comments by saying "modern-day
diplomacy is not exercised by creating axes" and noted however
that Israel has rejected that the accord meant the creation of a
Turkish-Israeli axis.
</P>
<P>
The Greek minister expressed satisfaction over the way the
Egyptian government reacted and provided assistance to the victims
of last week's attack by an Islamic fundamentalist group in Cairo
in which 18 Greek tourists were killed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, the Greek defense
minister announced that his Egyptian counterpart was due to visit
Athens in the near future to implement a defense accord agreed
between the two countries last year during the former's visit to
Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Moussa arrived late Tuesday night for a scheduled two-day
official visit to Greece.

<HEADLINE> Road Reconnaissance Begins for 555 H.K.-Beijing Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A route reconnaissance has
been undertaken in China by the Federation of Automobile Sports of
China (FASC) and the Hong Kong Automobile Association (HKAA) to
ensure the readiness of the route for this October's 555 Hong
Kong-Beijing Rally.
</P>
<P>
For the first time since the event was inaugurated in 1985, a
medical helicopter is to be on hand at all special stages this
year to provide emergency aid.
</P>
<P>
The FASC and HKAA, the sport's authorities in China and Hong
Kong and organizers of the 555 Hong Kong-Beijing rallies,
accompanied by Willard Martin, clerk of the course for the Rally,
checked the route for this year's 3,600 kilometers event.
</P>
<P>
Much of the route will be the same as in 1994 and 1995, with
the only change being the reroute of Leg 2 to finish in Shaoguan,
Guangdong Province, for additional accommodation, according to the
organizers.
</P>
<P>
Several special stages will be shortened because of
infrastructure progress in China, where roads previously used
will be tarmac-paved prior to the rally. The organizers also plan
to introduce at least one new stage, probably within the city of
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"The advantage of having a route similar to that of previous
rallies is that it allows the organizers to concentrate on
refining existing facilities as well as improving the overall
standard of the rally," said Martin.
</P>
<P>
"A prime concern of ours, as it is of all those involved with
championship-standard rallying, is safety and I am pleased to
confirm this year's event will have a medical helicopter covering
all competitive stages," said Kendy Chan, chief executive officer
of the HKAA.
</P>
<P>
This year's Rally begins on October 19 in Hong Kong and
finishes in Beijing on October 25. The route travels through
Chinese provinces of Guangdong, Hunan, Hubei and Hebei before
ending in the Chinese capital.

<HEADLINE> US Prepared Against Terrorism During Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. federal authorities
are stepping up activities to get prepared against possible
terrorist attacks during the summer Olympic Games in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
The 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in New York and last
year's bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building have provoked
heightened concern about the possibility of some kind of terrorist
attack at the Olympics, The Washington Post said today.
</P>
<P>
The terrorist use of poison gas in the Tokyo subway system last
year has sown unprecedented anxiety about threats from
unconventional weapons, it added.
</P>
<P>
During the 17-day event, the Atlanta city's population will be
doubled and about 40 heads of state are expected to come.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, a task force under Vice President Al Core has been
set up to deal with possible terrorist attack. And a large
security force are being formed for the Games.
</P>
<P>
The force, more than doubling the 12,000 law enforcement
officers that protected the 1984 Olympics in Los Angles, will
consist of 3,000 Army troops, 6,300 National Guardsmen, and 10,000
other police and private security guards, with an additional force
of agents from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms, the Post revealed.
</P>
<P>
In preparing for the worst, the FBI and other agencies are
holding secret exercises against terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a three-day exercise was held in Atlanta against
terrorist nerve gas attack in the city and a plane hijacking at
the Atlanta airport.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Defense Nuclear Agency organized an exercise to
test its ability of dealing with a terrorist detonation of a
nuclear device near the city's center and another trill was
planned to deal with a germ-weapon attack.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the federal authorities will establish two
"explosive centers", where conventional bombs can be detonated or
defused.
</P>
<P>
The cost of these efforts has not been calculated, but the
Pentagon budget for supporting the Games is at least 47 million
dollars and an additional 25 million dollars has been committed by
the Georgia State on security, the paper noted.

<P>
LONDON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- British police have seized a batch
of illegally held weapons in a house they raided shortly after
midnight, according to a BBC TV report this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In the raided house in Garston, Liverpool, police officers
seized two handguns, a sub-machinegun, a hand grenade, plus
ammunition and a small quantity of drugs.
</P>
<P>
A 41-year-old local man was later arrested and now is being
questioned at a police station.
</P>
<P>
The British government launches a national gun amnesty today
which allows for illegally-held firearms.
</P>
<P>
The amnesty, which will last from June 3 to June 30, was aimed
at strengthening security after a mass killing at a primary school
in Dunblane, central Scotland, on March 13.
</P>
<P>
Britain was shocked by the tragedy in which middle-aged gunman
Thoms Hamilton armed with four semi-automatic pistols burst into
the school gym and opened fire at 29 children. Sixteen pupils and
one woman teacher were killed and another 12 children wounded.

<HEADLINE> Eurotunnel to Fight on Despite Record Company Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Eurotunnel, The Anglo-French
Channel tunnel operator, Monday unveiled losses of 925 million
pounds (1.4 billion U.S. dollars) for 1995, its first full year of
operation, one of the largest single-year deficits ever by a UK
company.
</P>
<P>
Eurotunnel has been in negotiations with its 225 banks since
September, when it suspended interest payments on 8.1 billion
pounds (12.2 billion US dollars) of debt after deciding that it
could not meet its interest payments from revenues for many years.
</P>
<P>
It said Monday that little progress had been made in the bank
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Alastair Morton, co-chairman of Erurotunnel, conceded that
there was no chance of Eurotunnel repaying its debt during the
56-year life of the operating concession.
</P>
<P>
But he said the company's financial performance was rapidly
improving, adding that Eurotunnel had grabbed almost half of the
cross-Channel market in its first year of operations and had made
it the market leader.
</P>
<P>
The company is forecasting an increase in turnover of at least
50 percent this year and costs are budgeted to be cut by 20
percent a year for three years.
</P>
<P>
An initiative to boost turnover further is expected to be
announced next month. This is likely to include a further
intensification of the price war against the ferries on duty-free
shopping at the tunnel terminals.

<HEADLINE> Boutros-Ghali Urges Reconciliation in Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali urged the faction leaders in Liberia to
cooperate fully with the international community in seeking a
peaceful solution to the current crisis, according to a U.N.
document available today.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the president of the Security Council,
Ambassador Juan Somavia of Chile, Boutros-Ghali noted that
widespread looting and complete breakdown of law and order have
engulfed Monrovia, capital of Liberia, since hostilities erupted
in the West African country on April 6.
</P>
<P>
Though intense fighting has now died down, armed fighters
continue to roam and loot what is left of the city. Thousands of
people have been displaced and are living in desperate conditions,
food and water are in short supply and an endemic disease
threatens more people as conditions are rife for spread of the
disease, he added.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the concerted efforts of the international community,
the leaders of the Krahn forces on the one hand and those of
Charles Taylor and Alhaji Kromah on the other held a meeting last
Thursday aimed at putting to an end to the fighting and
reactivating the peace process foreseen under the Abuja Agreement
of August 1995, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Peace will not come to Liberia unless they are willing to work
together towards genuine national reconciliation, and respect for
the basic human rights of the citizens of their country," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
"They must immediately restore the cease-fire, disengage their
forces and return to the Abuja peace process, which offered the
Liberian people the hope that peace and stability would finally
come to their country," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the faction leaders to ensure that international
agencies which are assisting the innocent people of Liberia are
allowed to fulfill their mandate and the vehicles and equipment
taken by the factions are returned to the United Nations Observer
Mission in Liberia.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Minister On Creation Of Regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Industry and Commerce
Minister Herbert Murerwa today blamed the failure of many African
regional economic groupings on over-ambitious goals set by their
promoters.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening a Cross Border Initiative (CBI) workshop at
the on-going 37th Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF) in
Bulawayo, the country's second largest city, Murerwa said efforts
to create regional economic blocs which promoted trade in Africa
had recorded limited success.
</P>
<P>
''The limited success is largely due to over-ambitious and
unachievable targets being set, governments failing to implement
fully agreed programs while the private sectors played a
secondary role,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the CBI, which was formed in 1993, should be
the vehicle for regional trade and help correct the cross-border
obstacles to trade and investment and enhance cooperation among
the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) member countries.

</P>
<P>
"I was never for ASEAN, I am for total independence, a neutral
Cambodia," he said.
</P>
<P>
In explaining Cambodia's decision to move closer toward ASEAN,
the 73-year-old king said: "As I am a francophile and France
said 'go-ahead, join,' then I will."
</P>
<P>
"France gives solidarity with the rest of Europe as an example,
it wants us to do the same," Sihanouk added.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia, like Laos, is expected to join ASEAN, which groups
Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand
and Vietnam, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Sihanouk arrived in France on Friday for a three-day private
stay before going on official. The visit is his first outside
Asia since returning to the throne in 1993.
</P>
<P>
It's also the first state visit to France by any foreign leader
since President Jacques Chirac took office 11 months ago.
</P>
<P>
France, the former colonial power in Southeast Asia, is the
second aid donor to Phnom Penh after Japan.

<P>
HONG KONG, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Efforts on commercial
developments of Hong Kong's new airport which is essential to its
operation have been intensified in the last few months, according
to the Airport Authority (AA) here today.
</P>
<P>
With franchises for air cargo, aircraft catering and aviation
fuel support all awarded, and those for aircraft maintenance and
ramp handling about to be, 1996 will be the busiest year yet. The
AA and its business partners are making joint efforts on the
tightly scheduled construction program aiming to timely completing
the construction for the airport opening in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Private sector investment in the new airport has now reached
more than 20 billion HK dollars (2.56 US dollars) and Hong Kong
Government facilities 5.5 billion HK dollars (705 million US
dollars). Most of these developments are focused at the
southernmost part of Chek Lap Kok.
</P>
<P>
For example, the Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (HACTL)
Super Terminal 1, the building and express cargo center with a
gross floor area of 396.650 square meters, will be, when
completed, the world's largest stand-alone air cargo facility,
capable of handling up to 2.6 million tons a year.
</P>
<P>
And construction work is also under way for such facilities as
freight forwarding center, catering services and fuel supply.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Government also has stepped up its construction
program with the Architectural Services Department (AS)
responsible for the design and management of its building works
for the new airport.
</P>
<P>
Other construction include air traffic control complex and
tower, air mail center, headquarters for the Government Flying
Services, fire station building, police station and post office,
according to the AA.

WASHINGTON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. diplomats and their
colleagues from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
have met in New York to discuss a U.S. proposal to hold four-party
talks on the future of the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
State Department Spokesman Glyn Davies said today that the
April 19 meeting took place at the "working level," at which DPRK
officials asked questions about the proposal announced by
President Clinton during his visit to South Korea last week.
</P>
<P>
"At the meeting we answered some of the questions put to us
about the proposal. We continue to urge the North Koreans to
accept the proposal and have yet to receive a formal North Korean
response," he said.
</P>
<P>
He described it "a positive sign that they're asking
questions." "But what we would like to see is a definitive sign
that they are interested in taking this up," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States and DPRK were still discussing procedural
issues on opening liaison offices in each other's capitals, Davies
said, adding that most of the issues have been resolved.

BONN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Industrial growth in western Germany

<HEADLINE> Intel, Sharp Develop Smaller Flash-Memory Chips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Intel Corp. and Japan's Sharp
Corp. announced Tuesday a new memory chip technology that will
make it possible for smaller cellular phones, digital cameras and
portable computers.
</P>
<P>
The American and Japanese semiconductor makers said they had
jointly developed very minute, 0.4-micron processing for
eight-megabit flash memory chips, which reduces the size of the
chips by 44 percent compared with current 0.6-micron technology.
</P>
<P>
Another beauty of such chips is that they can hold data even
when the power is off. The random access memory chip, or DRAMs,
commonly used in computers, cannot do so.
</P>
<P>
This makes the industry able to turn out much more smaller but
powerful gadgets, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
Intel Vice President William Howe told a news conference that
flash memory chips were likely to quadruple in the next three
years to an annual market of 800 billion yen, or 7.47 billion U.S.
dollars, by 1999. The current market is about 190 billion yen, or
1.77 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Intel currently runs two flash memory lines at its New Mexico
fabrication plant. Sharp has one line at a plant in western Japan.
</P>
<P>
Both the producers, now having many competitors, said they
would send out sample chips soon.

WASHINGTON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
returned 124 million dollars to Pakistan as part of the money paid
years ago for F-16 fighter jets that were never delivered.
</P>
<P>
Under a deal to buy 60 F-16 jets from the United States for a
total of 1.5 billion dollars, Pakistan in 1989 paid 658 million
dollars of the total. Washington later held up the aircraft sale
simply on suspicion that Pakistan was developing a nuclear weapons
program.
</P>
<P>
It was not until January this year that the United States
agreed to return the money to Pakistan. Meanwhile, Washington is
seeking new customers for the F-16s originally intended to be
delivered to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani ambassador here today received two checks of 62
million dollars each. The embassy said that discussions were
continuing on reimbursement of the remainder of the money for the
jets.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein,
political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), announced today
that his party will contest the elections in Northern Ireland
scheduled for May 30.
</P>
<P>
Adams said he believed that there was widespread support out of
the crisis-laden province for "real talks" on the future of Ulster
and for a democratic peace settlement, reported BBC TV this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The report said the Social Democratic and Labor Party (SDLP),
the largest Catholic republican party in Northern Ireland, will
also take part in the elections.
</P>
<P>
The poll will determine the make-up of the 110-strong peace
forum from which delegates will be selected to attend the planned
all-party negotiations on Ulster's future scheduled for June 10.
</P>
<P>
The British government has introduced a legislation bill in the
parliament which allows 22 political parties and eight
independents to contest the elections.
</P>
<P>
However, both the British and Irish governments said that Sinn
Fein could take part in the elections and its representatives
elected could also sit in the forum, but this party could not be
admitted to the all-party negotiations unless the IRA renews its
cease-fire shattered with a huge blast in east London on February
9.

<HEADLINE> Anti-China Attempt Foiled Again: Ren Yanshi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The 52nd session of the U.N.
Commission on Human Rights has again shot down a draft
resolution against China, marking another failure by the West to
use human rights to interfere in China's internal affairs, Ren
Yanshi said in an article entitled Anti-China Attempt Foiled
Again issued today.
</P>
<P>
This is the sixth such failure by Western countries, led by the
United States, since 1990, said the article.
</P>
<P>
It said before the start of the current session of the UN Human
Rights Commission, the United States had resorted to various means
to damage the image of China on human rights.
</P>
<P>
It said that during the session, the U.S. and a few other
Western countries spared no efforts in canvassing support for
their draft resolution and even tried to manipulate some
non-governmental organizations in launching world-wide anti-China
activities.
</P>
<P>
All these, however, ended in failure, thanks to the majority
member countries of the UN Human Rights Commission which upheld
justice despite pressure from the U.S. and other Western
countries. And Such a failure was inevitable, as the draft
resolution ignores the actual human rights conditions in China and
runs counter to the principles of the U.N. Charter and
prevailing trends, the article said.
</P>
<P>
China has made remarkable achievements in promoting human
rights, as well as in economic and social development in recent
years. Nevertheless, some Western countries chose to ignore these
facts, putting forward anti-China resolutions instead to exert
political pressure on China and alter China's development path
and social system, it said.
</P>
<P>
In fact, it said, the United States is itself not qualified to
act as the `human rights judge' it pretends to be.
</P>
<P>
A recent comparative study of the human rights conditions in
China and the U.S., published in China, revealed that China does
better than the U.S. in human rights in 24 areas.
</P>
<P>
By applying double standards, the U.S. attacks on China's human
rights record cannot be convincing to the international community.
</P>
<P>
Groundless accusations against China under the pretext of human
rights cannot enjoy popular support because such an attempt runs
counter to the principles set out in the Charter of the United
Nations, said the article.
</P>
<P>
It said one major principle of the U.N. is to achieve
international cooperation in solving international problems and to
promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, which
reflects the common aspirations of the peoples of all nations.
</P>
<P>
It said that the U.N.'s human rights institution should be a
place where all countries can develop political cooperation and
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
It should not be used as a weapon by a handful of countries to
stage political confrontation, nor should it be a tool of a
certain superpower to practice power politics and hegemonism
against the developing nations, the article said.
</P>
<P>
It recalled the Cold War era when the U.N. Human Rights
Commission had been dominated by political confrontation. But with
the end of the Cold War, shaking off the darkness of outdated
confrontations over human rights has become the urgent wish of
people around the world, it said.
</P>
<P>
However, clinging stubbornly to the Cold War mindset, the
U.S., the only superpower in today's world, is intensifying its
efforts to interfere in other countries' internal affairs under
the human rights banner, which has made sharpened political
confrontation over human rights issues, said the article.
</P>
<P>
Manipulated by the U.S., the U.N. Human Rights Commission has
passed 58 country resolutions since 1992, almost all of them
against developing countries. China has been one of the major
targets, according to the article.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. practice of confrontation and double standards over
human rights issues is being increasingly challenged by developing
countries, it said.
</P>
<P>
It added that at the current session, more and more
representatives from developing countries, including China, called
for dialogue, cooperation and consultation in the work of the
Human Rights Commission.
</P>
<P>
The article said that representatives from some countries of
the European Union, in contrast to those from the U.S. and certain
other Western countries, also agreed that constructive dialogue
should replace confrontation in the Commission.
</P>
<P>
It said there was mounting evidence that the practice of
exerting pressure upon a country by discussing the country's human
rights record had entered a blind alley.
</P>
<P>
It went on to say that the draft anti-China resolution was
doomed to a failure because it contradicts the purpose and
principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The failure of the resolution is a victory for China and all
countries which support the U.N. Charter, the article said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that China was, as always, ready to work with all
international forces upholding justice to promote the healthy
development of human rights and to fight against hegemonism and
power politics practiced under the banner of human rights.

<HEADLINE> UK Beef Exporters Hand Out Steaks in Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- British beef exporters gave away
10,000 pounds (15,000 U.S. dollars) worth of prime Scottish steak
Tuesday in protest against the lack of emergency aid to keep them
in business following the European Union (EU) export ban over the
mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
The "great beef giveaway," outside the House of Commons, was
organized by the International Meat Traders' Association which
claimed that 35 million pounds (52.5 million dollars) of
government aid was needed immediately to prevent the collapse of
the export industry.
</P>
<P>
The beef, in six pound packs usually worth 30 pounds (45
dollars) each, was all taken by an eager crowd of passers-by in 20
minutes.
</P>
<P>
Martin Richardson, an exporter, said, "We are doing this to
show the government that the only thing we can do with beef is
give it away."
</P>
<P>
He was angry that financial aid to help farmers had been
announced, but nothing had been done to assist his sector of the
industry.
</P>
<P>
The beef, approved for human consumption before the EU ban,
falls outside the government's existing compensation payments
system and some meat exporters face bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
The beef export industry is worth around 600 million pounds
(900 million dollars) a year to the economy and the association
fears that up to 28,000 jobs are at risk unless the government
intervenes.
</P>
<P>
Exporter Morris Bond, who donated the meat, said his company
had 1 million pounds (1.5 million dollars) worth of beef waiting
on the high seas outside South Africa which he could not land or
return to England, and had already laid off 200 of its 600
workforce.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture said a number of sections of the
industry were suffering, but it was not possible to compensate
everyone.

<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Sweden has
further reduced the country's short-term repo interest rate by
0.25 percentage point from 7.15 to 6.9 percent, the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
This is the the ninth time that Sweden has cut its repo rate
this year, making the current rate two percent lower than it was
at the beginning of 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, the reduction had no real effect on the market since
the move had been expected and the market acted in advance -
interest rates fell on Friday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sweden's low inflation rate, currently 1.7 percent, is one
factor which has allowed the central bank to cut the repo rate so
frequently this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
PESHAWAR, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A visiting Pakistani senator has
sought the support of a Pakistani religious alliance for his
effort to mediate between the Afghan warring groups and the
government.
</P>
<P>
A close aide of Qazi Hussain Ahmed, President of Pakistan's
Jamaat-i-Islam and senator, told Xinhua here today that the
senator is seeking help from the Milli Yakjahti Council, an
alliance of 29 Pakistani religious parties.
</P>
<P>
The aide said that Qazi realized, after talks with Afghan
President Burhanuddin Rabbani, there was a need for more support
from Pakistani religious parties for peace in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The senator is seeking formation of a delegation of top leaders
of the alliance and hoped the delegation would soon visit
Kandahar, where they would hold talks with leaders of the Taliban
religious student militia.
</P>
<P>
Qazi arrived in Kabul on Monday at the invitation of Rabbani
for a two-day visit. However, he extended his stay till Sunday,
according to his aide.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, he held talks with Rabbani following a
detailed meeting with Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, chief of Hezb-i-Islami
in the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad.
</P>
<P>
The aide said that following a meeting with Rabbani and his
allies, Qazi once again met Hekmatyar in his hide-out in Sarobi
near Kabul and went to Kabul for more discussions.
</P>
<P>
Qazi, a Pakistani fundamentalist, championed Hekmatyar's
faction during the guerrilla war against Afghanistan's Soviet
occupation.

<HEADLINE> Indian Auto Industry Grows Fast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Indian automobile industry
has recorded a 23 percent growth in sales during April 1995 and
March 1996, compared to the corresponding period in the financial
year of 1994-1995, the Press Trust of India said today.
</P>
<P>
The industry sold more than 3.5 million vehicles during April

the same period of 1994-1995, according to the latest annual
industry figures of the Association of Indian Automobile
Manufacturers (AIAM).
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> EU Wants Role in Freezing DPRK's Nuclear Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
presented a proposal today to give the European Union (EU) a key
role in the body coordinating global efforts to freeze the nuclear
program in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
The proposal, now pending the approval by the EU Council of
Ministers, is for the European Atomic Energy Community to become a
member of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization
(KEDO).
</P>
<P>
KEDO was established in March 1995 by the United States, Japan
and South Korea to raise money and provide technical aid for the
DPRK to build two light-water reactors instead of graphite
reactors, which have potential weapons-making capability.
</P>
<P>
The new initiative, according to EC, is aimed at making DPRK's
nuclear program "safer and less military-oriented".
</P>
<P>
The EC also proposed that 15 million ECUs, or about 19.5
million U.S. dollars, be contributed to KEDO annually from the
Community's funds over five years, together with European
technical expertise.
</P>
<P>
The EU's Council of Ministers had already decided on February
26 to contribute five million ECUs, or 6.5 million dollars, to
KEDO as part of its Common Foreign and Security Policy Joint
Action for the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
So far, Australia, New Zealand and Canada have applied for
membership of KEDO.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The French government today passed
three bills on social security, hospital reforms and medical
expenditures, triggering street demonstrations by doctors.
</P>
<P>
But Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Jacques Barrot
stressed again the importance of reforms to curb welfare spending,
although the proposals sparked a nation-wide strike at the end of
1995.
</P>
<P>
Barrot suggested that hospitals and doctors should pay more
attention to the quality of service and treatment.
</P>
<P>
In turn, patients who benefit from state medical care should
trust doctors instead of putting pressure on them by demanding
unnecessary tests and sick leave certificates, the minister said.

<HEADLINE> New Chechen Separatist Leader Confirms Dudayev's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Chechen separatist leader
Dzhokhar Dudayev's vice-president, Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev,
confirmed today that Dudayev has been killed and buried at a
cemetery in southern Chechnya, the Itar-Tass news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Yandarbiyev, 44, who reportedly assumed Dudayev's powers on
Monday, told Itar-Tass that the late separatist leader "was buried
this morning in the presence of close relatives at one of the
rural cemeteries in southern Chechnya."
</P>
<P>
He refused to specify the exact place, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Yandarbiyev participated in the mourning ceremony for Dudayev
which took place at the home of Dudayev's cousin in the village
of Salazhi, 35 kilometers southwest of the Chechen capital of
Grozny.
</P>
<P>
Itar-Tass quoted a number of Dudayev's "comrades-in-arms" as
reporting on Tuesday and earlier today that Dudayev was killed
late Sunday night in a Russian rocket attack near the village of
Gekhi-Chu, five kilometers southwest of Salazhi.
</P>
<P>
However, the Russian military in Chechnya denied any
involvement in Dudayev's death and suggested that he could have
been killed by rivals in the separatist leadership.
</P>
<P>
The Russian military commander in Chechnya, Vyacheslav
Tikhomirov, told Itar-Tass by telephone today: "If Dudayev is
dead, this could be a result of clan contradictions in the top
leadership of illegal armed formations."
</P>
<P>
"Neither the air force, nor the artillery carried out any
combat operations near the settlement of Gekhi-Chu on the night of
April 21-22," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tikhomirov said claims that Russian forces killed Dudayev could
have been made by those who want to disrupt Russian President
Boris Yeltsin's peace plan for Chechnya.

<HEADLINE> Dudayev Killed in Revenge for Ambush: Russian Officer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A senior Russian officer said
today that Chechen separatist leader Dzhokhar Dudayev was killed
by Russian forces in retaliation for last week's ambush against a
Russian convoy in which nearly 100 soldiers were killed.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry officer told the Itar-Tass news agency
that the retaliatory action consisted of a series of rocket
attacks on all Dudayev's known hide-outs.
</P>
<P>
"A series of missile and bomb strikes were delivered at a
number of targets in the mountain regions of Chechnya on April
21-22," the officer said, stressing that "the aim was to eliminate
Dudayev's six or seven possible headquarters which were known to
the federal (Russian) side."
</P>
<P>
However, Russian military commander in Chechnya Vyacheslav
Tikhomirov denied any involvement of Russian forces in the death
of Dudayev, who was reportedly killed by a Russian missile strike
on Sunday night near the village of Gekhi-Chu, 30 kilometers
southwest of Chechnya's capital, Grozny.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry officer said that Dudayev often talked
over a satellite telephone with Russia and Turkey from the bank of
the Gekhi river, but added that he was not trying to contact
intermediaries in Moscow when the missile struck, as had been
reported.
</P>
<P>
The officer, who participated in talks with Dudayev and knew
him personally, rejected the possibility that the separatist
leader could have announced his "death" so that he could
"resurrect" on the eve of the presidential elections in Russia in
an effort to influence the results of the vote with a new
terrorist act.
</P>
<P>
Describing Dudayev's successor, Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, the
officer said he was one of the ideologues of Chechen separatism.
</P>
<P>
"He is one of the organizers of the National Congress of the
Chechen people, a strong ideologue of the separatist movement who
always sat close to Dudayev at news conferences. However, he could
not become a public politician, he is poorly known in Chechnya,"
the officer said.
</P>
<P>
He said that there were three influential groups in Dudayev's
entourage. One consists of a number of field commanders, the
second was led by Chief of Staff Aslan Marskhadov and the Basayev
brothers, and the third was headed by former Chechen prosecutor
Usman Imasayev.
</P>
<P>
"Yandarbiyev does not belong to any of the groups," the officer
said, but added that he could have influence as he was "close to
the money box," Dudayev's finances, and money plays a huge role in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
He said that the popularity of Marskhadov is second only to
Dudayev. However, he warned that "one should not pin great hopes
on him as he is more cunning, dangerous and smarter than Dudayev."
</P>
<P>
The officer said that during last year's peace talks Marskhadov
appeared ready for compromise only on those issues which could not
be resolved by military means.
</P>
<P>
According to Itar-Tass, Yandarbiyev, who has replaced Dudayev
as acting president, premier and commander-in-chief of the
separatist movement, pledged to continue the fight for
independence from Russia.
</P>
<P>
"The fact of the tragic death of the first president of
Chechnya has not broken the Chechen people and they are ready to
continue the fight for independence which began under the
leadership of Dzhokhar Dudayev," Yandarbiyev told Itar-Tass.
</P>
<P>
Dudayev, 51, led the armed resistance in Chechnya against
Russian troops who entered the breakaway republic in December 1994
to "restore constitutional order."

<HEADLINE> German Central Bank Says EU Far from Monetary Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The European Union is still far
from establishing a monetary union as set out in the Maastricht
Treaty, the Deutsche Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, said in
its 1995 annual report.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the performance of EU member states in
1995 in dealing with financial deficits, national debt, long-term
interest and exchange rates was even worse than in the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
Only Denmark, Ireland and Luxemburg succeeded in keeping
financial deficits under three percent of the gross domestic
product (GDP), which is the standard set by the Maastricht Treaty
to establish a monetary union.
</P>
<P>
Germany's financial deficits in 1995 increased from 2.6 to 3.5
percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
As for the national debt, the treaty requires that a country's
total debt should not exceed 60 percent of its GDP, but only
Germany, France, British and Luxemburg have met this requirement.
</P>
<P>
However, the report spoke highly of the progress the EU made in
checking inflation in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Nine out of the 15 EU member states have succeeded in keeping
inflation below 2.7 percent. Finland, with one percent inflation,
enjoyed the most stable prices in the EU, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The six countries which failed to reach the 2.7 percent
inflation standard are Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Britain and
Sweden.

<HEADLINE> Katyusha Rockets Continue to Fall on Northern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Katyusha rockets continued
today to fall on the northern part of Israel, as the country
celebrated its Independence Day, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
One person was slightly wounded and several damages were
caused by Hezbollah's Katyusha attacks at the Galilee panhandle in
northern Israel this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
A number of Katyusha rockets were also fired at northern towns
and villages and the western Galilee areas this afternoon, no one
was injured and no damages were reported in those attacks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli army airplanes and artillery went on to
carry out attacks against Hezbollah targets in the Tyre area and
other parts of southern Lebanon, as the Operation Grapes of Wrath
entered its 14th day today.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, traveling in the north of
the country today, said that Israel's military operation against
Hezbollah will end as expected.
</P>
<P>
However, he refused to give any details.
</P>
<P>
Peres visited Israeli army positions on the Israeli-Lebanese
border, and also went to bomb shelters to meet with residents
of Kiryat Shmona, a northern Israeli town which has been under
Katyusha attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since the military operation started on April 11, tens of
thousands of residents evacuated their homes in northern towns
and villages, seeking havens southward, while the remaining
residents have been spending most of their time in bomb shelters
and security rooms.
</P>
<P>
Peres said Israeli army is taking all necessary measures to
stop Hezbollah's Katyusha attacks at the north of the country,
adding that the army has been carefully carrying out their
actions, trying not to hurt Lebanese civilians.
</P>
<P>
He blamed Hezbollah for drawing Israeli army fire on civilians
by firing Katyusha rockets from behind or inside places where
Lebanese civilians were taking shelters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher held
talks with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad in Damascus today, as
he continued his shuttle diplomacy between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Christopher is reportedly to meet with Lebanese Prime Minister
Rafik al-Hariri later today in Lebanon, in an effort to bring a
cease-fire in southern Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Genetic Links Found To Explain Why Mad Cow Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- British scientists have found
close genetic links between the mad cow disease and its human
equivalent, Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease (CJD), which could explain
why the disease can infect human.
</P>
<P>
The prion proteins-caused diseases could have occurred only by
chance with odds worse than 1.2 in 10,000 against, David Krakauer
and his colleagues at the University of Oxford report in the
science journal Nature to be published here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
That could explain why people could infect CJD from eating meat
from mad cows and never got CJD from eating sheep infected with
scrapie, the ovine version of the disease.
</P>
<P>
The British government admitted on March 20 that people might
possibly get CJD from eating beef after scientists identified a
new strain of CJD, which is always fatal, in 10 victims.
</P>
<P>
The researchers compared the nucleotide sequences of the genes
of naturally occurring prion proteins in a variety of animals to
give an evolutionary family tree. The cattle prion is, as
expected, more closely related overall to that of sheep than to
the human form.
</P>
<P>
Cattle and human prions share two unusual features of their
sequence that are not found in sheep prions.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Victory for Justice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Prolonged applause broke out in
the U.N. conference room here Tuesday when China succeeded in
blocking a vote on an anti-China draft resolution sponsored by the
West at the 52nd session of the UN Human Rights Commission.
</P>
<P>
The victory, the sixth of its kind since 1990, belongs to both
China and other developing countries, as well as countries that
uphold justice.
</P>
<P>
The conference room, which can seat 500, was filled to
capacity, with journalists and representatives from
non-governmental organizations packing the public gallery. All
were closely watching the outcome of the North-South confrontation
triggered off by some Western countries in the Human Rights
Commission.
</P>
<P>
The Italian delegate started the discussion by briefing
participants on the draft resolution which was sponsored by the
European Union (EU) and supported by the United States. But
Chinese ambassador and head of delegation Wu Jianmin later refuted
the West's allegations against China's human rights situation with
facts and convincing arguments.
</P>
<P>
In tabling a no-action motion, Wu said that the West-sponsored
draft resolution, was politically-motivated and could not disguise
its anti-China nature, no matter how nicely it was packaged.
</P>
<P>
He said that the resolution was directed against not only China
but all other developing countries.
</P>
<P>
He added that what really interests the West was power politics
or hegemony rather than the human rights of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador's speech met with the immediate
acceptance of many participants, including some journalists
covering the event.
</P>
<P>
In the face of pressure from the West, many developing
countries, in particular Asian and African nations, expressed
their strong support for China.
</P>
<P>
They strongly criticized the West for politicizing human rights
issues and applying double standards toward developing countries
such as China, while hailing the tremendous achievements China has
made in recent years in its economic reforms as well as in
promoting human rights.
</P>
<P>
The representative from Mauritania said in a speech that the
tremendous progress and marked achievements made by China deserve
high praises from the international community and that the draft
resolution engineered by the West only serves to damage the
efforts made by China in promoting human rights.
</P>
<P>
Delegates congratulated China one after another following the
fierce, hour-long debate which ended with a vote on the no-action
motion tabled by China. The motion was adopted by the 53-member UN
Human Rights Commission by a vote of 27 to 20 with six abstentions.
</P>
<P>
Delegates said they believed that the outcome sent a strong
signal to the West that confrontation would not work and it was
against the popular will to use human rights to interfere in other
countries' internal affairs and pursue hegemony and power politics.
</P>
<P>
However, it seems not likely that the few Western countries led
by the United States will accept their failure and change course,
although the fact that the six anti-China draft resolutions
engineered by them since 1990 have all been foiled have fully
demonstrated that any acts of using the human rights issue to
interfere in other countries' internal affairs are doomed to
failure.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats who participated in the current session of the UN
Human Rights Commission believe that the North-South confrontation
and struggle over the human rights issue are far from
over. Nevertheless it is the expectation of many people that the
UN Human Rights Commission will in the end abandon confrontation
and embrace cooperation and dialogue. And it is the widely held
belief that Justice will in the end triumph in the Human Rights
Commission.

<HEADLINE> NATO: No Reduction of IFOR Mission Until After </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of NATO's Military
Committee Klaus Naumann said today that NATO's top generals agreed
at a meeting held Tuesday that there should be no reduction of the
60,000-strong peace mission in Bosnia until after elections in late
summer.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference at the NATO headquarters, General Naumann
said the chiefs of staff of NATO countries discussed at Tuesday's
spring meeting the issues of the continuation of the NATO mission
in former Yugoslavia and the adaptation of NATO's military
structures, including those for the eventual enlargement of the
alliance.
</P>
<P>
As for the situation in former Yugoslavia, he said, the military
is now focusing on the period between the 120th and 270th days of
the operation, with the aim of providing a secure environment for
the holding of elections in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
On the adaptation of NATO's military structures, General Naumann
said the chiefs of staff had an intensive discussion on this issue
but did not take any decisions.
</P>
<P>
"The Military Committee still waits the guidance to be given by
the North Atlantic Council at the ministerial meeting in Berlin in
June," he said.
</P>
<P>
For the first time since France announced last December to take
steps to come back into the alliance, the country attended Tuesday's
meeting, which was described by U.S. General John Shalikashvili as
a "very historic moment."
</P>
<P>
Chiefs of staff of NATO members today also held their fifth
meeting with Partnership for Peace countries in Central and
Eastern Europe and the Baltic region.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, NATO presented to its partners for the first
time the exercises it will carry out in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Urged To Give Fallen Fighters Pension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Leader of the Movement for
Democratic Process (MDP) in Zambia Chama Chakomboka today
appealed to the government to give pensions to widows of former
freedom fighters who died during the struggle of independence.
</P>
<P>
Most of these families were suffering because they could not
face the harsh realities of the day, Chakomboka stressed.
</P>
<P>
Their children should be afforded a chance to receive their
education from primary to university free of charge, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested the the government establish a holiday for
all freedom fighters in their memory. The holiday should be
called "Zambia's Liberators Day", he said.
</P>
<P>
Zambian freedom fighters, using peaceful means, won
independence in October 1964.

<HEADLINE> UN-Iraq Talks on Oil-for-Food End Without Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The third round of talks
between the U.N. and Iraq on the oil-for-food plan came to an end
without a deal here today.
</P>
<P>
But, negotiators of both sides were optimistic that they would
finalize the text of a memorandum of understanding in the next
round of talks which will be held in early May.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi chief negotiator Aabul Amir al-Anbari expressed the hope
that the next round would be most successful and the text will be
finalized.
</P>
<P>
He noted that during the third round of talks, some countries
were objective to some of the provisions of the text and made
quite a few amendments.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether it was the United States which was opposed
to the deal, the Iraqi ambassador said that he did not talk about
any particular country and he talked with the U.N. negotiator
only.
</P>
<P>
United Nations Under-Secretary-General Hans Corell, head of the
U.N. delegation, said that they had discussed the text of the
memorandum of understanding and the text was revised over and over
again in the process.
</P>
<P>
He noted that both U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali
and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz had expressed the
political will to conclude an agreement.
</P>
<P>
Asked why they had not reached a deal during the just finished
round of talks, Corell said that it was a process as many details
should be addressed. In the past 39 sessions of discussion many
questions had been set out.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has imposed economic sanctions on Iraq after
it invaded Kuwait in August 1990. The long time economic sanctions
have resulted in a lot of hardships for Iraqi people and some
500,000 children died of malnutrition, flu, bronchitis and other
common diseases due to lack of food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council adopted Resolution 986 last April,
allowing Iraq to export oil worth 2 billion U.S. dollars in six
months to import food, medicine and other necessities. But, Iraqi
authorities did not accept the offer, saying the monitoring terms
violated its sovereignty, until last January.
</P>
<P>
The two sides conducted the first two rounds of talks in
February and March this year.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Describes Israeli Attack on Lebanon as </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today described Israel's offensives against Lebanon as a crime
that can not be justified and tolerated.
</P>
<P>
In a nationally broadcast speech marking both Israel's 1982
withdrawal from the Sinai peninsula and May Day, Mubarak said that
the two-week attack on Lebanon was threatening the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak reiterated Egypt's commitment to supporting the
Lebanese people and protecting their interests and security.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel's practices would seriously harm future
coexistence between Arabs and Israel.
</P>
<P>
University students demonstrated for the third consecutive day
today in protest of the Israeli shelling of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian government has condemned the attacks and
reportedly postponed a visit by parliament members to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdul-Meguid also condemned
the Israeli shelling, according to Egypt's Middle East News Agency
(MENA).
</P>
<P>
"The situation in Lebanon is difficult, and the Israeli
transgressions on Lebanese soil are unacceptable," he
said. "Problems cannot be solved militarily."
</P>
<P>
At the start of his 80-minute speech, Mubarak called for a
moment of silence to mourn a police general and three Egyptian
policemen who were killed Tuesday while raiding a hideout of
Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
Two suspected Islamic militants were also killed and police say
they were involved in an attack which killed 18 Greek tourists
last week.

<HEADLINE> Christopher: To End Fighting in Lebanon is Most </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHTAURA, LEBANON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of
State Warren Christopher said here today that "the most
important thing to do is to end the fighting (between Israel
and Hezbollah) and let the Lebanese civilians return to their
homes."
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in the city of Chitaura, 45 kilometers east
of Beirut, following 90-minute talks with Lebanese Prime Minister
Rafik al-Hariri and House Speaker Nabih Berri.
</P>
<P>
Chitaura is on the western edge of Lebanon's eastern Beqaa
Valley, and only 20 kilometers west of the Syrian border.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held here following the talks Christopher
said that he came to Lebanon to "demonstrate America's deep
concern over the sufferings of the Lebanese people and to reaffirm
the U.S. support of Lebanon's independence, sovereignty and
territory integrity."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary of state arrived here this afternoon from
Damascus where he held talks with Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad. His meeting with the lebanese leaders began at 5: 30
p.m. local time (15:30 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Berri said he believed that "a result could be possibly
reached within 24 hours." But he said that it will be a "temporary
agreement."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Lebanon will not give up its right of
resistance before the Israeli troops withdraw from Lebanese lands.
</P>
<P>
Hariri said he would see "a better situation in Lebanon in the
future, in the very next future."
</P>
<P>
He also stressed his concern for achieving "a cease-fire
(between Israel and Hezbollah) as soon as possible and to see the
 Lebanese people to live in peace."
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Christopher left for Damascus, then to
Israel.

<HEADLINE> US Orders for Durable Goods Up in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Orders to U.S. factories for
durable goods rose 1.4 percent in March, the first gain in three
months, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said that orders for durable goods in
March totaled a seasonally adjusted 167.6 billion U.S. dollars, up
from 165.3 billion in February. The increase was the first since a
3.1 percent advance last December.
</P>
<P>
The 2.3 percent drop in February had been the steepest since
orders plunged 4.6 percent in April 1995. Orders fell 0.6 percent
in January.
</P>
<P>
Orders for durable goods are considered as a key gauge of the
nation's manufacturing sector and an increase could lead to
greater production and more jobs.
</P>
<P>
The gain in March was led by transportation orders which shot
up 9.4 percent, reflecting a large increase in aircraft that
offset a decline in automobiles. A big drop in aircraft orders in
February led to an 11.6 percent plunge in the transportation
component.
</P>
<P>
Excluding transportation, orders fell 1 percent, the first
decrease since a 2.4 percent drop last November.
</P>
<P>
Orders for military goods, another volatile sector, jumped 73
percent after dropping 21.1 percent a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
The backlog of unfilled orders rose 1 percent after edging up
0.2 percent in February. It was the seventh straight monthly
increase. A growing backlog suggests more jobs and longer
production lines may be needed to meet demand.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Anti-Terrorism Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
signed anti-terrorism legislation into law on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton signed the bill in a ceremony at the White House.
Witnessing the signing were victims of terrorist attacks,
including survivors of bombings at the Oklahoma City federal
building on April 19, last year, the World Trade Center in New
York and the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said federal law had to be upgraded in order to stop
today's more sophisticated breed of terrorist.
</P>
<P>
"America will never tolerate terrorism. America will never
abide terrorists," Clinton said. "Wherever they come from,
wherever they go, we will go after them."
</P>
<P>
The legislation authorizes 1 billion dollars in funding for
federal law enforcement agencies to combat terrorism and puts new
limits on the number of federal appeals filed by death-row
inmates.
</P>
<P>
It also requires the death penalty for killing current or
former federal employees because of their work and in certain
international terrorism cases.
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, authorities could deport alien terrorists
without disclosing classified evidence against them, fund raising
for terrorism could be prevented, and plastic explosives would be
required to have chemical tracers.
</P>
<P>
The legislation was approved by Congress last week as the
nation marked the one-year anniversary of the Oklahoma City
federal building bombing that killed 168 people.

<P>
LAGOS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria currently has about 7,000
troops in the West Africa peacekeeping force, ECOMOG, operating
in Liberia, Nigerian Chief of Defense Staff Major-General
Adbulsalam Abubakar said today.
</P>
<P>
The figure represents an increase of about 1,000 soldiers from
the strength last year.
</P>
<P>
The peacekeeping force in Liberia has begun meeting with
leaders of the warring factions with a view to forging better
understanding, the officer said.
</P>
<P>
"All hands are on deck to resolve the crisis," Abubakar said,
adding that "things have improved" from last week's fighting in
Monrovia, capital of Liberia.
</P>
<P>
He said that ECOMOG is negotiating with the factions to
dissuade them from the continuous fighting that has characterized
their relationship.
</P>
<P>
Monrovia has been plunged into disorder following clashes
between forces loyal to Roosevelt Johnson and those of Charles

<HEADLINE> Turkish Parliament to Investigate Ciller </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish parliament today
passed a motion to investigate former Prime Minister
Tansu Ciller over alleged irregularities in government contacts.
</P>
<P>
The motion raised by the Islamist opposition Welfare Party (RP)
was passed by 232 votes to 179 in the 550-seat assembly in a
secret vote. Many deputies from the Motherland Party (ANAP), the
coalition partner of Ciller's True Path Party (DYP), apparently
voted for the investigation.
</P>
<P>
The RP's motion claims that under Ciller's leadership,
irregularities were disclosed in government contacts concerning
the electricity distribution company DEDAS.
</P>
<P>
After the vote, Ciller said that she had been victimized by a
political maneuver. She said there was "strong reaction from her
party colleagues" over the "yes" votes by deputies of their
coalition partner ANAP.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen parliamentarians from various parties will form a
special committee for the investigation in the next two months to
prepare a report on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Ciller has also been under threat of further probes into her
controversial wealth, especially those in the United States.
</P>
<P>
It seems that RP, which failed in finding a partner to form a
coalition government despite the fact that it came out of last
year's election as the leading party, is trying to weaken Ciller
and demolish the central-right coalition with ANAP.

<HEADLINE> UN Urges Angola to Accelerate Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council today urged Angolan Government and the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) to take
necessary actions to move the peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
In a presidential statement, Ambassador Juan Somavia of Chile,
president of the Security Council for April, said that the council
noted that some progress had been achieved during the past two
months in the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol though it was
limited.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council expressed concern over delays in the
quartering of UNITA troops and urged UNITA to move expeditiously
in this aspect. Only some 20,000 of the UNITA 62,500 troops have
been quartered so far.
</P>
<P>
The council also urged UNITA to fulfill its commitment to turn
over all of its arms, ammunition and military equipment as the
quartering process continues.
</P>
<P>
On the government side, the council emphasized the importance
of completion of the Calendar of Actions for April, including the
pull-back of government troops from area near UNITA quartering
sites, the return of the Rapid Reaction Police to barracks, the
resolution of the question of amnesty for UNITA officials, and the
adoption of a plan to disarm the civilians.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council voiced its concern at the extensive
presence of landmines throughout Angola and expressed support for
non-governmental organizations to address this problem.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year civil war in Angola, the longest in Africa, claimed
some one million lives and displaced 7 million more. The United
Nations has played an active role in promoting peace process in
Angola since the Security Council established the United Nations
Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM I) in 1988.

<P>
MAPUTO, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Former general of Mozambique's
first opposition Resistencia Nacionae de Mocambique (Renamo)
Mateus Ngonhamo today denied an allegation that he was to be
demoted in the new military troops.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that Ngonhamo, now Deputy Chief of General
Staff in Mozambique's national defense forces, has spaced out
from Afonso Dhlakama, President of the Renamo.
</P>
<P>
Ngonhamo said in an telephone interview with the Mozambique
Information Agency that Dhlakama now had no power over him in the
new army and he should only obey Chief-in-Commander of the armed
forces, President Joaquin Chissano.
</P>
<P>
Yesterday, Dhlakama told a news conference that it was rumored
that President Chisano was trying to push former Renamo officers
out of the military.
</P>
<P>
But Ngonhamo said that he was shocked by the speech by
Dhlakama, adding that it was senseless because he was serving
the army for the nation instead of for any party.

<HEADLINE> EC's Anti-Fraud Hotline Gets 4,600 Calls in First Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- An anti-fraud hotline set up by
the European Commission (EC) received 4,652 calls in its first
year of operation, according to a report evaluating the service.
</P>
<P>
Most of the calls were apparently made out of curiosity, but
230 calls were followed up, and 13 of them led to the opening of a
formal inquiry, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The hotline, established in November 1994, is part of efforts
by the EC's Anti-Fraud Unit to fight fraud involving the Community
Budget. It provides citizens of the European Union with a
confidential means to offer information, in their own language,
about possible fraud.
</P>
<P>
The 24-hour hotline costs about 10,000 ECUs (13,000
U.S. dollars) to run, while inquiries into the fraud cases
identified through the line may cost the EC an estimated 30
million ECUs (39 million dollars) or more.

<HEADLINE> Fire Hazard Awareness Campaign in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Between 1993 and 1995, there were
86,000 fires in public places in China that claimed over 6,500
lives, injured more than 11,000 people, and caused economic losses
of more than 2.9 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, high-rises, hotels, restaurants,
shopping malls, and public entertainment facilities fit up with
large quantities of combustible materials have mushroomed in China.
</P>
<P>
A total of 111 large department stores or markets and 123
public entertainment facilities, such as dance halls, were
destroyed by fire during that three-year period. Three-quarter of
the fires in China occurred in buildings and their losses
accounted for nearly 90 percent of the total losses caused by
fires.
</P>
<P>
So, a month-long campaign, sponsored by the public security,
labor, construction and internal trade ministries, and the
National Administration of Tourism, to make people more aware of
the importance of fire safety and inspections will be launched in
major cities next month.
</P>
<P>
Experts here say that one of the major causes of disastrous
fires is failures of fire-fighting equipment. Apart from the poor
quality and bad design of equipment, the cause of disastrous fires
is often a failure to maintain the equipment and a lack of
awareness of fire-fighting measures.

<HEADLINE> China to Reinforce Supervision of Construction Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua said
today that the government should improve legal restraints on the
country's construction business, which is vital to the rapid and
sound development of the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came from a written speech to a national conference
on supervision of construction project, in Shijiazhuang, capital
of north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
According to the vice-premier, during the Ninth Five-Year Plan
(1996-2000), China will keep annual investment in fixed assets at
no less than two trillion yuan (about 241 billion US dollars),
although the central government will control the scale of
investment, especially in the first two years.
</P>
<P>
Over 60 percent of the investment will go to the construction
sector, he pointed out, and at the same time priority will be
given to supervision of construction projects and to
anti-corruption efforts.
</P>
<P>
State Councillor Li Guixian also expressed his concern about
the current situation in the construction business: "Many serious
and complicated cases that broke the law have been uncovered in
construction sector in the past several years."
</P>
<P>
According to Li, President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng have
repeatedly said that supervisions and special investigations
should focus on areas where many serious problems exist, such as
finance, securities, real estate, land deals, and construction.

<HEADLINE> IPR Protection in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has always
supported Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) protection, Zhang
Yuejiao, director general of the Department of Treaty and Law
under the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, told
a press conference today.
</P>
<P>
"China spent a decade perfecting an IPR protection system,
which took decades or hundreds of years for developed countries to
perfect," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Trademark, patent, and copyright laws, and one against unfair
business competitions have been in effect since China adopted its
reform and opening-up polices in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
"A legal system at the international level on IPR protection
was established," she said, citing the Trademark Law, which
conforms to international principles and protects trademarks of
all kinds.
</P>
<P>
China is one of a few countries to list computer software as
one of the objects to be protected by copyright laws, she said,
and it is a signatory of international conventions and agreements
on IPR protection.
</P>
<P>
"But many countries don't accept those conventions, such as the
Paris Convention on industrial property protection and the Madrid
Agreement on trademark registration," Zhang noted.
</P>
<P>
She said that China's enforcement of IPR protection laws is
"open, fair and serious".
</P>
<P>
"There are only a few countries, including China, to establish
IPR tribunals in their courts," she said. Twenty of them have been
established in higher and intermediate people's courts in China,
and IPR cases have been handled by the civil or economic tribunals
in all people's courts.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, more than 18,630 cases of IPR violations have been
handled by the people's courts, with 90 percent of them having
been resolved, she said.
</P>
<P>
China has also made a contribution to worldwide IPR protection
since a large-scale publicity campaign of IPR protection among 1.2
billion Chinese, or about a fourth of the world's population, was
carried out, Zhang stressed.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 Chinese colleges and universities have opened IPR
courses, and training centers have been set up.
</P>
<P>
The official said she hoped foreign countries can take a more
objective look at what the Chinese government has done in
protecting intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
She said that some judges from the U.S. and EU, who visited
China, have praised the country for its efforts and achievements
in protecting IPR.
</P>
<P>
"China has become one of the more advanced countries in the
developing world in IPR protection," Arpad Bogsch,
director-general of the World Intellectual Property Organization,
said during his 1994 visit to China.
</P>
<P>
"The change is from nothing to everything. The whole world
admires what China has achieved in a very short time," he
said.

BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said in a
meeting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin in Beijing today,

</P>
<P>
"We agree to develop a strategic partnership for the 21st
century based on equality, mutual benefit and confidence," Li
said, declaring that the talks between the presidents of the two
countries this morning had far-reaching significance.
</P>
<P>
China always holds the view that the two countries should
develop long-term, stable, neighborly relations and increase
co-operation and consultation in international affairs, Li pointed
out. This accords with both countries' interests, and is
beneficial to world peace and stability and in line with the trend
toward a multi-polarization world.
</P>
<P>
The premier noted that this trend is "much better than for a
country to order others about," and that China understands
Russia's opposition to NATO's eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia have co-operated well in international
affairs, without directing the cooperation against any third
party, and solely for the safeguarding of world peace and
stability.

Chinese premier again, and his hope that the visit will raise
bilateral ties to a new level.

issues, he noted, saying he hopes leaders from the two countries

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian Interior Minister Anatoly
Kulikov today confirmed that Chechen separatist leader Dzhokhar
Dudayev was killed, but did not say who killed him.
</P>
<P>
"The fact of the death of Dzhokhar Dudayev is being confirmed
by the information available at the current time," he told
reporters here.
</P>
<P>
This was the first official confirmation of reports of
Dudayev's death from a top Russian minister.
</P>
<P>
Kulikov refused to speculate on future developments in
Chechnya, but said that the Russian military would like to end the
war.
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to make any long-term predictions about the
situation in Chechnya, but the most desirable for the military
will be the cessation of combat activities," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vyacheslav Tikhomirov, commander of Russian troops
in Chechnya, reconfirmed the death of Dudayev but denied reports
that the rebel leader was killed by a Russian missile strike on a
village some 30 kilometers southwest of Grozny on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Dudayev's death was a consequence of a power
struggle within the Chechen separatist leadership.
</P>
<P>
Russian leaders, including President Boris Yeltsin and Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, have said that negotiations for a
peace settlement in Chechnya would continue with or without
Dudayev.

Being posted in Pakistan for only three weeks, Moo said he is
looking forward to a meaningful relationship with businessmen of
the city.
</P>

is in favor of ROK, he would try to bring about an increase in

The statement released today further refined and enriched the
principles for forging long-term, stable, and friendly relations
between the two countries. Both China and Russia have in the
statement committed themselves to building a strategic and
cooperative partnership based on equality and mutual trust, geared
to the 21st century. Observers here noted that this is the first
time for countries, especially for big countries, to commit
themselves to building such a relationship.
</P>
<P>
This is a good political basis for China and Russia to build a
new type of national relations.
</P>
<P>
In the previous joint statements, the two sides stressed the
importance of respecting each other's sovereignty and territorial
integrity, non-aggression, non-interference, equality, mutual
trust, and respect for the country's choice in seeking its own
development path.
</P>
<P>
Differences of social systems and ideology will not affect the
normal growth of relations. Countries should not use hegemonism
and power politics of any form.
</P>
<P>
These set principles have provided a guarantee for the
development of Sino-Russian relations, and the consensus reached
by China and Russia on many international issues as well as on
cooperation in the United Nations will contribute to the cause of
world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
In military affairs, the two countries agreed that neither
would be the first to use force against the other, especially in
the case of nuclear weapons, and vowed not to aim strategic
nuclear weapons against each other.
</P>
<P>
The most part of the 4,300-km boundary line between China and
Russia has been clearly marked in accordance with the law,
providing conditions for creating a border of harmony,
neighbourliness, peace, and tranquility.
</P>
<P>
In the area of bilateral relations, both China and Russia
attach great importance to cooperation in the economy, in trade,
and in science and technology.
</P>
<P>
A series of cooperative agreements signed here today will help
realize the possibility of complementing each other's economies.
</P>
<P>
With more multinational groups emerging in the world today,
economic cooperation between China and Russia under the principle
of equality and mutual benefits will help establish a new economic
order in the world and promote common development of all countries.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the new type of Sino-Russian relationship
will surely benefit the people of both countries and contribute to
peace and stability in the world.

<HEADLINE> US Urges For Improving Investment Climate In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States Ambassador to
Zimbabwe, Johnnie Carson, today complained about the high
interest and inflation rates in Zimbabwe which she said are discouraging
U.S. investment.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate was over 30 percent and the inflation rate
reached a new high of 23 percent by March in the southern African
country, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
"Interest rates are goo high. Inflation is too high. And there
needs to be a greater effort to create an environment which
attracts foreign investors," said Carson.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy was responding to questions on why many
American investors had shunned Zimbabwe, preferring to pour
millions of U.S. Dollars into neighbouring South Africa.
</P>
<P>
However, she said the Clinton Administration is seeking to
expand the markets and investment throughout the southern African
region, taking advantage of a favorable political and economic
climate.
</P>
<P>
Year-on-year inflation in Zimbabwe has started to decline on
the back of a good agricultural season after peaking at 28
percent in January -- the highest since April 1993 when it was
pegged at 30.7 percent.

After hearing from four independent neurosurgeons that she had

Johnston, breathing by herself, can open and shut her eyes, but

Doctors at Law Hospital will wait until any potential appeal

<HEADLINE> HSBC Asset Management Positive on China's Equity Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong-Shanghai Banking
Corporation (HSBC) Asset Management announced at a press
conference here today a positive assessment of the prospects for
China's equity markets in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
The assessment highlighted China's improving economic outlook
and the reasonable valuation of many China-based companies.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on China's economic outlook, Graham Muirhead,
Director Asia Pacific Equities, said: "China's austerity measures
appear to have successfully contained domestic inflation. Between
1978 and 1994, China's stop-go policies resulted in wildly
fluctuating economic growth and an escalating inflationary
spiral. These problems have now been addressed," he said.
</P>
<P>
"China's rapid economic growth has transformed its economy into
the 11th largest in the world and third largest in terms of
purchasing power. This growth has been fueled by a combination of
trade and foreign investment inflows. The main engine of growth
has been the emergence of a new, dynamic, non-state sector," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Utilized foreign investment in China has also risen from 3.49
billion US dollars in 1990 to around 36.5 billion US dollars in
1995. Foreign investment is expected to remain high and will help
sustain future economic growth," he added.
</P>
<P>
As to China's stock markets, Ching Ju Yeh, Senior Investment
Manager, commented: "China still has a tiny equity market compared
with the size of its economy and the capital needs of
industry. Whilst China's gross domestic product now accounts for
around 24.5 percent of the Asia-Pacific region, its stock market
is only 0.3 percent. The potential for growth in the absolute
size of China's equity markets is enormous," he said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the investment outlook, Ching said: "At current
valuations, China's stock markets offer interesting investment
opportunities with limited downside risk for investors. Liquidity
is improving and confidence will be further bolstered by
recovering earnings in 1996 and 1997," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Inflation has now fallen to a controllable level and most
major indicators of economic activity are pointing to a
re-acceleration in the economy. Despite this improving
macro-economic outlook, the upcoming corporate results will
reflect the historical impact of China's austerity measures," he
added.

the yoke of corruption and injustice," he told a crowded press
conference.
</P>

Imran underlined the importance of having a single syllabus for
the entire nation and said the present education system is
creating division within the country by producing aliens and
radicals simultaneously.

He said he wants the movement to be strengthened from the
grassroots level because the leadership emerging from it must be
mature and clean in character.

KUALA LUMPUR, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian defense minister
Syed Aamid Albar said here today that Malaysia will ultimately
need to own a submarine although it is not an urgent requirement
now.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the parliament house, Syed Hamid said:
"We plan for the future. We do not have to do it hurriedly. But
ultimately I believe we will need to have a submarine."
</P>
<P>
However, the defense minister said while Malaysia was keen to
have a submarine, the priority to own one would be based on
financial ability and capability.
</P>
<P>
"There is no allocation to purchase a submarine in the Seventh
Malaysian Plan (1996-2000), but we want to present a case and
obtain in principle the agreement from the government to buy the
submarine during the period," Syed Hamid said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Syed Hamid said when opening a defense services
conference here that countries in Asia Pacific and Southeast Asia
must strive to establish defense forces that are more
self-reliant.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Woo GM Project in Last Ditch Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Manila today offered to waive all
local government taxes for a five-year period in a last ditch
effort to woo the one billion US dollar project of US auto giant,
General Motors (GM) Corp.
</P>
<P>
The offer was made by Laguna Governor Jose Lina after
indications that the GM seems to favor Thailand over the
Philippines as the investment site for its project.
</P>
<P>
Lina said that these incentives include the business permit,
real estate tax and rent-free use of a 50-hectare lot, among
others.
</P>
<P>
"On top of these, we are the most strategic investment place
among the areas being looked at by the GM," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Laguna governor said that the available lot in Calamba is
just 40 kilometers away from the port of Batangas and 45 minutes
away from the Ninny Aquino International Airport.
</P>
<P>
Lina's incentive package is still on top of the incentives
offered by the government through its incentive granting agencies
such as the Board of Investments and the Export Development
Council.
</P>
<P>
The GM is expected to formally announce the chosen location for
its project in June this year.

<HEADLINE> Russian Military Commander Reaffirms Dudayev's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Russia's military commander in
Chechnya, General Vyacheslav Tikhomirov, reaffirmed today that
Chechen rebel leader Dzhokhar Dudayev had been killed.
</P>
<P>
General Tikhomirov stressed that Dudayev's death was "a
consequence of power struggles within the Chechen separatist
leadership," according to the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
Dudayev, 52, was reported to have been killed in a Russian
missile attack on a village some 30 kilometers southwest of Grozny
on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
"No special operation was carried out by federal (Russian)
troops to do away with Dudayev," Tikhomirov insisted.
</P>
<P>
He said claims that Dudayev was killed in reprisal for a rebel
attack on a Russian army convoy were "a bizarre attempt to shift
the blame for the possible derailment of the peace plan for
Chechnya to federal forces."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sergei Stepashin, secretary of Russia's Federal
Commission on Settlement in Chechnya, said Dudayev's death
coincided with real opportunities to invigorate negotiations for
a peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin noted that the commission had advocated consultations
with Dudayev, and (Russia's) Tatar President Mintimer Shaimiyev
and King Hassan II of Morocco had offered to act as mediators.

<HEADLINE> WHO Warns Cholera Outbreak in Monrovia Could Spread </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) today said a cholera outbreak in Monrovia could quickly
spread amid the chaos and deteriorating sanitation conditions
caused by weeks of fighting.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, it confirmed the presence of cholera in a district
of the beleaguered Liberian capital.
</P>
<P>
Forty-seven cases of cholera have been reported at a refugee
compound in Greystone, where about 15,000 people have sheltered
since gunbattles broke out between rival factions early this month.
</P>
<P>
"Under the chaotic conditions, the cholera outbreak could
quickly spread and endanger the lives of large numbers of
residents and displaced persons in Monrovia," the U.N. health
agency said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Without treatment, case fatality rates can reach 50 percent or
higher, said WHO.
</P>
<P>
The massive looting of relief agency warehouses two weeks ago
has led to a lack of medical supplies to treat the epidemic, WHO
said, adding that its second consignment of medicines for treating
cholera is on the way to Freetown, Sierra Leone, for transshipment
to Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, WHO airlifted by helicopter from Freetown to
Monrovia emergency medicines and equipment, including surgical
supplies for treating an estimated 1,450 wounded -- its most
immediate priority.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 of the wounded stay in the refugee compound in
Greystone.
</P>
<P>
Some 450 others, including 100 children, have taken refuge at a
health centre in the cholera-stricken district, where at least 350
acute diarrhoea cases have been reported, resulting in 70 deaths,
50 of whom were children, said WHO.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that it is working to limit the spread of other
epidemics in the city due to the water and sanitation
problems.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said here
today that China will continue to contribute to safeguarding the
rights and interests of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
While expressing his thanks for the 14 African countries that
opposed a proposal that was tabled by certain countries at the
recent UN human rights conference, Li said these African countries
have upheld justice. He told Nigeria's Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi
that China is a country that holds to justice and principles.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, Li said
that the Chinese government treasures its friendship, unity and
cooperation with Nigeria and is willing to develop them further on
the basis of the five principles of peaceful co-existence.
</P>
<P>
China and Nigeria have enjoyed a sound relationship since the
establishment of diplomatic ties 25 years ago and have had
achievements in cooperation in trade and other economic aspects,
Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said that developing countries face a major task in
restoring and developing their economy after having gained
independence politically, and a necessary condition for that
development is national unity and stability. He added that China
appreciates the policies and measures the Nigerian government has
adopted for this end.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier also expressed his appreciation for the
"one-China" policy the Nigerian government has taken and its not
developing official ties with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has implemented a non-aligned policy of neighborliness
and friendship and has contributed to safeguarding African unity
and stability and to promoting world peace and development through
active involvement in African and international affairs, Li
said. He noted that China is willing to increase cooperation with
Nigeria in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi arrived in Beijing Thursday at the invitation of Chinese
Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi, with whom he co-chaired the third
session of Sino-Nigerian Joint Committee on Trade and Economy.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that his government attaches much
importance to increasing cooperation with China, especially in
trade and the economy.

<HEADLINE> 1 Million Telephones Needed by 2000 in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's telephone demand so
far has reached an average of 75,000 per year and the total number
needed by the year 2000 is expected to be one million, Minister of
Posts and Telecommunications Mangala Samaraweera said today.
</P>
<P>
The minister said at a press conference that the statistics
make it clear that meeting the demand for basic telephone service
requires urgent attention.
</P>
<P>
currently, among 245,000 applicants on the waiting list for
telephone service, 210,000 have already got the service provided
by the Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT).
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the SLT's average growth rate of 25
percent would result in some 650,000 subscribers being connected
by the year 2000. This figure falls far short of the government's
target of one million.
</P>
<P>
The SLT managed to provide a total of 24,500 new connections in
1995 and 25,000 in 1994, and the SLT cannot be expected to meet
the demand in the foreseeable future, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He also said the government has decided to bring in two other
operators to supplement the efforts of the SLT and provide at
least another 200,000 lines by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
In order to meet the growing demand for telephones by the
corporate sector, private subscribers and government institutions,
the government has offered bids for reputed companies to establish
a local wireless loop system, the minister added.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of travelers are
stranded in the Tanzanian capital of Dar es Salaam and Zambia's
cities of Mbeya and New Kapiri Mposhi following a railway
accident last week.
</P>
<P>
An official of the railway told Xinhua today that express
train services has not yet resumed for a disruption caused by a
goods train accident at a bridge in Zambia a week ago.
</P>
<P>
The shortage of funds has also been the cause of failure by
the railway to transport maize to Zambia from Dar es Salaam Port,
prompting a verbal war last month between the TAZARA railway
authority and Zamiba's Minister of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Normal train services continue between Dar es Salaam and
Tunduma in Tanzania's Mbeya region. On Zambia's side, traveling
is possible only up to the point where the accident occurred.
</P>
<P>
"From there, passengers from Zambia have to either continue
with their journey to Dar es Salaam by bus or board a normal
service train of TAZARA," said the official.
</P>
<P>
The TAZARA was built by China in 1976.

<HEADLINE> Efficient Use Of Fuels Raises Profits: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- More efficient use of fuels
would increase profits of Australian industry by 1.5 billion
Australian dollars (1.125 billion US dollars) a year, said a
report published here today.
</P>
<P>
The report, drafted by the Bureau of Industry Economics, said
that results of an energy efficiency survey showed that the mining
and manufacturing sectors could cut electricity consumption by 4
percent. That would cut emissions of the gases in the process,
saving 164 million Australian dollars (123 million US dollars) a
year in energy costs, the report added.
</P>
<P>
The bureau based its conclusions on a study of energy audits
from 700 Australian firms in the mining and manufacturing sectors,
said the report, adding that 98 percent of the companies could
improve energy efficiency without losing money and the vast
majority would make significant cost savings.
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled "Energy Efficiency and Greenhouse Gas
Abatement," calculates savings that can be made through "no
regrets" measures--those which will not bring additional financial
costs to the companies involved or social or economic costs to
workers or local communities.
</P>
<P>
As signatories to the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change, the report said, Australia and other
industrialized nations have committed themselves to reducing their
emissions of greenhouse gases to the 1990 level by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Without such measures, Australia's emissions would be expected
to increase from the 572 million ton level of 1990 to 654 million
ton level in 2000 --an increase of 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said that energy use accounts for about half of
Australia's greenhouse gas emissions, the rest comes from sources
ranging from rotting vegetation in landfills to bushfires, and it
is estimated that about 70 percent is attributable to energy
consumption by business.

<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- China's formula for advancing its
role in the world chemical industry was spelled out at a major
international conference in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The country can make steady progress only through international
cooperation, and exchanging and learning advanced experience with
and from the rest of the world, said Song Jian, state councillor

conditions are available for a sustained, rapid and healthy
development.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China should, and can greatly improve
industry as a whole, and the chemical industry in particular.
</P>
<P>
The conference, jointly sponsored by the SRI International of
the United States and the Chinese Ministry of Chemical Industry
(MCI), aims at providing a basic knowledge of the development
trends of the Chinese and international chemical industry and
creating more cooperation opportunities for the Chinese chemical
industry.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that Chinese statesmen and people are aware
that it is imperative to develop the economy in a sustained way,
reform the economic system, and change the economic growth mode in
order to take up forthcoming challenges as the new century
approaches.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese chemical industry should conform to
the overall development strategy of the world economy, take note
of the features of the world economic structure, and adjust both
product and industrial mixes.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China should introduce advanced technology to improve
the entire chemical industry, Song said.

<HEADLINE> China's Central Revenues Grow Steadily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The first quarter of 1996 saw
China's financial revenues surge 27.6 percent, and expenditure
increase by 14.5 percent, from the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
But low efficiency and heavy losses in state enterprises have
led to large number of overdue taxes, reveal statistics released
by China's Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
By the end of March, overdue taxes rose 12.4 billion yuan from
the beginning of the year, 55.1 percent more than the first
quarter in 1995, and as a result, the central treasury did not
receive as much revenue as expected.
</P>
<P>
To maintain stable revenue sources, China should take effective
measures to help enterprises, especially large and medium-sized
state enterprises, improve management, enhance efficiency and
reduce losses, said an official with ministry.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises should be urged to pay overdue taxes as soon as
possible, and efforts should be made on the enterprises which have
not paid large tax bills on time.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that funds should be appropriated and sent to
agriculture, education, science and technology, and
poverty-stricken regions as soon as possible, as required by the
budget to ensure smooth development in those fields.

<HEADLINE> One-in-Twelve Chinese Work for Private Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (xinhua) -- China's private businesses have
become one of the country's powerful economic forces, according to
report by the country's State Statistics Bureau (SSB). More than
one in twelve Chinese workers are now employed by private
companies.
</P>
<P>
The SSB says in the report that in the Eight Five-Year Plan
(1991-1995), about 55.7 million people were employed by private
companies and household businesses in China, nearly two and a half
times that of 1990. It mean an average annual increase of 19.7
percent, or 6.6 million people.
</P>
<P>
Provisional statistics show that the registered capital of
private business in 1995 totalled 444 billion yuan (53 billion US
dollars), nine times that of 1990. Sales income chalked up more
than 1,000 billion yuan, six times that in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The report show that there were nearly 26 million registered
private companies last year, 11.5 million more than in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Business owners possess three times more wealth in 1995 than
they did in 1990, which averaged 400,000 yuan. Among them, 46,000
companies have registered capitals beyond one million yuan, and
7,000 have more than five million. It was also reported that 500
private company groups have been established.
</P>
<P>
An economic expert said that although private companies are
mostly concerned for their own development, they have contributed
much to helping the government ease the country's employment
pressure.
</P>
<P>
An estimate by the SSB says that private business has created
14 million jobs for the country in cities and towns during the
past five years, accounting for 40 percent of that created in the
whole country during the period. In the rural regions it accounted
for 30 percent, or 19 million people.

SHANGHAI, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai is expected to put into
force rules governing its housing accumulation fund from July 1,
in a bid to ensure the sound operation of the fund.
</P>
<P>
The rules lay explicit stipulations governing the payment,

<HEADLINE> Strike call not Lead To Record Rand Low: Mandela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The new record low of South
Africa's currency Rand was not caused by the strike call of the
Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU), President Nelson
Mandela said today.
</P>
<P>
Mandela made the remarks at his official Cape Town residence
in a response to news that the Rand had been trading as low as
4.3125 to the Dollar at one stage on Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said the dollar had in fact strengthened against all
currencies, not only the Rand.
</P>
<P>
The COSATU resolved at a meeting last weekend to organize a
nationwide one-day strike on April 30 to protest the lock-out clause
included in the country's final constitution, scheduled to be adopted
on May 8.

<HEADLINE> Social Service Commitment System Benefits Residents in Yantai (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yantai, April 25, (Xinhua)-- Calls flooded into the offices of
the Tap-Water Company and the Heat Supply Company in Yantai City,
Shandong Province, as residents complained bitterly about
waterlogging the basement of their apartment building.
</P>
<P>
The accident was due to the leakage of either water pipes or
heat supply pipes.
</P>
<P>
The two companies would not usually have dealt with the
accident immediately, because no one knew exactly which of them
should be held responsible.
</P>
<P>
But the companies did not shirk their responsibilities, and
instead joined forces to solve the problem within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
Yantai residents agreed that the speedy solution was due to the
introduction of a social service commitment system by government
departments, institutions and enterprises, including public
utilities.
</P>
<P>
Under the system which was launched in June 1994, all
government departments and service agencies make commitments to
the public concerning their service items, service standards,
service procedures, and the time limit for handling matters.
</P>
<P>
In addition, supervisory offices have been set up and hot lines
installed for citizens to exercise supervision. Those failing to
honor their commitments face penalties.
</P>
<P>
Practice shows that the new system has proved to be very
effective in improving both the quality and efficiency of services
provided by government departments and various enterprises.
</P>
<P>
One local resident overcharged on his way to a hospital by a
taxi-cab driver complained about the driver's misconduct to the
Yantai City Public Transport Company.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he was compensated and the driver fined because
under the social service commitment system, drivers may not
overcharge customers by deliberately lengthening mileage.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Macao Neighborhood Committees Praised for Caring Elderly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MACAO, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Eighty-two-year-old Liang Libing
never married during her life. She has been living alone since her
 adopted son died a dozen years ago. But she said she was happy
because of the caring from the government and the neighborhood
committees.
</P>
<P>
"I am quite satisfied," she said. "I need not worry about food
 or house. The Government and the neighborhood committee cared me
very well."
</P>
<P>
Dressed in an old-style dark blue clothes, Liang now lives in
a unit of house the Macao Government offered for the elderly who
live alone. The unit has a kitchen, a toilet, and is equipped with
 simple furniture.
</P>
<P>
"Out of my monthly pension of 1,000 Patacas (126.6 US
dollars), I only need to spend 60 to 70 Patacas on the rent, water
 and electricity," she told Xinhua in a recent
interview. "Besides, the nurses are always available for help."
</P>
<P>
Like Liang, thousands of elderly people in Macao are now being
 cared by the non-governmental Macao neighborhood committees,
aside from help from the government.
</P>
<P>
Sending nurses to the senior centers to take care of the
elderly is only part of the work done by the General Union of the
Macao Neighborhood Associations, which is composed of 25 regional
branches scattered all over Macao, said Jo Hong Meng,
deputy-secretary-general of the union.
</P>
<P>
The union has established 15 senior centers in different
communities in Macao, helping the elderly keep in contact with the
 society. The centers also offer courses on health-care, current
affairs, calligraphy, singing and drama.
</P>
<P>
"So far, at least 2,000 elderly people, whose age range from
55 to 98, have become members of our elderly people centers," Jo
said. "They come to the centers almost every day."
</P>
<P>
Some elderly people who attend the centers said that they have
 benefited a lot from those centers. Social gatherings and care
liberated them from depression and loneliness, and some people
have learnt to better handle relations with other people,
especially, their offspring.
</P>
<P>
Macao now has about 20,000 people above the age of 65, out of
which 3,500 live alone. In the past ten years, some 30 elderly
people centers were set up by different community organizations,
with about half of them being under the neighborhood committees.
</P>
<P>
"When elderly people keep in contact with the society, caring
for the society, they become open-minded," Jo said. "They are less
 likely to fall ill, because they remain in high spirit and know
the ways to keep fit."
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood committees are also helping the elderly
people, especially, those who live alone, by organizing volunteers
 to visit them regularly.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 volunteers have been mobilized to visit 400 such
 elderly people at least once a month.
</P>
<P>
"The volunteers bring the elderly out for sightseeing, give
them gift each month, and bring them quilts and winter clothes in
the winter," Jo said. "They also help them urge the government to
build more pension houses."
</P>
<P>
Jo said his union will continue its efforts to assist the
elderly to improve their living. More and more senior citizens
will show up in the near future, and how to care for them remains
a problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to urge the government to improve pensions
and build more houses for those living by himself or herself," he
said. "On the other hand, we will try our best to offer more
assistance to the elderly people."

<HEADLINE> Social Service Commitment System Benefits Residents in Yantai (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An official with the Policy Research Office of the Yantai City
Committee of the Chinese Communist Party noted that the social
service commitment system places various government departments
under supervision by the general public, thus exercising effective
restraints on them.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, services provided by government departments and
enterprises in the market economy have been subject to effective
supervision," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Yantai Mayor Ren Haishen said, "I think the power of government
officials should be to serve the people. The social service
commitment has defined this and has turned power into
responsibility."
</P>
<P>
According to the General Office of the Yantai City government,
government departments have markedly improved their services since
the introduction of the system.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the number of complaints received on the "mayor
hotline has plummeted 50 percent since the introduction of the
system.
</P>
<P>
"Under the system we cannot shirk our responsibility or shift
the blame onto others, and residents don't have complain to the
mayor about poor services as much as they used to do," said Gao
Aiqin, an executive of the City Public Transport Company.
</P>
<P>
China's central government is now encouraging governments of
other cities all over the country to draw on the social service
commitment system, in a move to improve efficiency and services of
government departments, and foster a new mood of society.

<HEADLINE> China Earnestly Performing Sino-US IPR Agreement Obligations, Official Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- China has completely and
earnestly complied with the Sino-US Intellectual Property Rights
(IPR) Agreement and effectively curbed 'piracy', a senior Chinese
official said in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference, Zhang Yuejiao, director of the
Department of Treaty and Law of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), gave full details of the measures
and achievements that Chinese legal departments have made to
protect intellectual property rights, and the cracking down on
piracy activities since the signing of the Sino-US IPR Agreement
in February of last year.
</P>
<P>
She said that 20 IPR tribunals have been established in higher
and intermediate people's courts across China, with IPR cases
handled by civil or economic tribunals at all-levels of people's
courts.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yuejiao said that last year 3,400 IPR cases were
received, and over 3,300 of them were dealt with by the people's
courts.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991 more than 18,600 IPR cases have been received by the
people's courts, 90 percent of the total dealt with, and more than
1,000 offenders have been brought to justice under criminal laws.
</P>
<P>
On April 16, Beijing Juren Computer Company, defendants in a
civil case involving computer software infringement, was ordered
to pay damages of 445,000 yuan to the infringed party,
U.S. Software Computer Company, and other two American computer
companies, as well as a forfeiting 80,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
China started an eight-month Special Enforcement Period between
January and August of last year. During that period, China
undertook investigations especially to fight the production and
sale of infringing products, with the result that a number of
illegal products confiscated, including 800,000 cassettes and
video-tapes, two million pirated CDs, 40,000 items of software and
480,000 books.
</P>
<P>
Later the protection of intellectual property rights became a
routine activity of legal departments in different localities.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yuejiao said that China finished the investigation,
clearing and rectification of LD and V-LD production lines
throughout the country before March 1995, and sent supervisors to
concerned production lines.
</P>
<P>
Thirty out of the existing 34 CD and LD reproduction factories
have completed registration formalities according to relevant
rules.
</P>
<P>
She said that early this year China closed all VLD showing
centers across the country.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said audio-visual administrative departments in provinces
of Guangdong, Jiangsu and Hainan made decisions last year to urge
six factories, which illegally reproduced pirated, obscene and
pornographic CDs, to stop reproducing disks or copying master
copies.
</P>
<P>
To date, licenses to permit the reproducing of audio-visual
products of those factories were cancelled, and those involved
were referred to the judicial authorities.
</P>
<P>
China's copyright departments have punished 15 units which have
infringed copyright, and treated 466 cases, covering infringements
of books, audio-visual products, LDs and computer software.
</P>
<P>
Customs throughout the country made announcements starting from
1994 that any goods infringing the exclusive rights of trademark,
copyright or patent rights are forbidden to be imported or
exported. More than 1,000 such infringement cases have been
investigated.
</P>
<P>
The above-mentioned facts have shown that China has been
earnestly performing the Agreement obligations to perfect the
legislation on IPR, and has strictly enforced such laws so that
notable achievements in IPR protection have been made, Zhang
Yuejiao noted.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Goes Tough On Dispute With Cameroon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has warned that any
further provocation by Cameroon over the oil-rich Bakassi
peninsula may lead to a full-scale war between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The warning came as restive Cameroonian gendarmes reportedly
launched fresh offensive against Nigerian troops at Bakassi last
Sunday, resulting in the collapse of the fragile peace which had
endured in the peninsula since February, it was reported today.
</P>
<P>
But the Nigerian forces returned fire and things quietened
down at the front for some time, Nigerian Information and Culture
Minister Walter Ofonagoro said in the capital of Abuja On
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, however, the Minister said, Cameroonian soldiers
opened fire on Nigeria's position again at the disputed
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
This time, he said, Cameroonian troops supported the offensive
with artillery and mortar fire, including helicopter gunships.
They even tried to ambush Nigeria's supply routes at two points.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian forces, he noted, had successfully cleared the
Cameroonian troops through serious counter attack in the past
days.
</P>
<P>
No figures of casualties are available currently.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the Nigerian government had on last
night warned Cameroonian soldiers to desist from further acts of
aggression at Bakassi as the escalation of the conflict would not
be in their interest.

<HEADLINE> Opium Film To Debut on Hong Kong's Return to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, April 25 (Xinhua) -- A full-length film telling the
story of how Hong Kong was ceded to Britain is to make its Chinese
screen debut - on the day that China resumes the exercise of its
sovereignty over the 'colony'.
</P>
<P>
 Shooting of the film "The Opium War" will start this month
and is expected to be completed by early next year. The film is
being funded by a mix of enterprises in China with most filming
work taking place in China. There will be some location shoots in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
Xie Jin, director of the film, said that the film will be put
on show across the China on July 1, 1997, the day the Chinese
Government resumes the exercise of its sovereignty over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The film is based on a real historical event, the Opium War
(1840-1842), which was launched by the British against China to
protect its illegal opium trade in 1840. The two-year-long war
ushered in the era of semi-colonial and semi-feudal society in
China, marking the start of modern society.
</P>
<P>
It is during this war that the corrupt Qing Dynasty (1644-1911)
court was unable to resist, and submitted to the British
invaders. In 1842, the Qing court signed an unequal treaty with
Britain. The treaty provided an indemnity and the cession of Hong
Kong, and opened five trade ports.
</P>
<P>
Actors and actresses of the film come from China's mainland and
Taiwan and Britain.

<HEADLINE> Small Nationality Has Big Dreams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- With a population slightly above
10,000, the Jing nationality, mainly living on three islands under
the jurisdiction of Fangchenggang City in south China's Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region, is perhaps one of the smallest ethnic
minorities in China.
</P>
<P>
However, the Jing people have big dreams.
</P>
<P>
"I have long dreamed of living in a building of two stories," a
young man of the Jing nationality in Wutou Village, Fangchenggang
City, said hopefully five years ago, which seemed to be a vain
hope at that time because shabby houses made of stone and earth
were the dominant scene on the island.
</P>
<P>
Today, all 334 households of the village boast their own
dwellings of two or more stories, the walls of which are decorated
with ceramic tiles or even better materials.
</P>
<P>
The apartment of Liu Chenghe, an ordinary villager, has a floor
space of about 400 sq m, which is very large by Chinese standards.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the net income of the village reached 6.16
million yuan (about 740,000 US dollars) last year, with per capita
annual income topping 4,200 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Xiurong, head of the village, said, "Instead of wholely
relying on fishing as our ancestors did, the new generation of the
Jing nationality engage in border trade, aquaculture and various
types of agriculture."
</P>
<P>
"Take Liu Chenghe, for example," Zeng continued, "He owns a 33
ha. clam-breeding farm which generates an annual net income of
80,000 yuan, after paying 100,000 yuan in taxes to the state."
</P>
<P>
Guan Bingliu, Party secretary of Fangchenggang City
disclosed: "The richest household in the village has assets worth
two million yuan. But that's not enough, and we are determined to
reach the goal of common prosperity."

<HEADLINE> 2 Unions Pull Out of Strike in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 25 (Xinhua)-- Two trade unions have pulled out
of the 6-day plantation workers' strike in Sri Lanka, sources from
the Planters' Association of Ceylon said today.
</P>
<P>
The strike, initiated by the Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC),
commenced Monday to press for trade union demands which affect
plantation workers.
</P>
<P>
The two unions are coalition partners in the ruling People's
Alliance government.
</P>
<P>
They claimed some of their demands had been met after talks
with Plantation Minister Ratnasiri Wickremanayake. Accordingly,
they said there is no need to prolong the strike.
</P>
<P>
They said that "the Plantation Ministry has prepared a
pragmatic program to ensure 300 days of work and the demand for a
wage increase of Rs 8 per day was not met to their satisfaction,
but the ministry has undertaken to review the position soon. As
such the government should be given time."
</P>
<P>
The CWC claimed the token strike was successful, but said the
situation had changed now and they had to consider whether to
convert the token strike into an indefinite strike, according to
local reports today.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the CWC said that the workers were keen on
extending the strike till all their demands were met as planned
earlier.

<HEADLINE> HK Prison Attacked by Masked Gang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Three masked men crashed a
stolen truck into a sentry booth outside the Siu Lam Psychiatric
Center Wednesday, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
A guard at the Siu Lam Center, which houses prisoners deemed to
 need psychiatric care, said that he saw a yellow truck
approaching the gate and the masked driver shouted at him to
leave the booth, claiming to have a gun and threatening to shoot.
</P>
<P>
The driver then reversed the truck towards the center's gate,
revved the engine and accelerated forwards into the guardhouse
twice, guided by the two other masked men.
</P>
<P>
The culprits then attempted to start a fire by dropping a
bottle containing a liquid, suspected to be petroleum, with rags
attached, into a dustbin in a guest waiting room nearby.
</P>
<P>
They also broke the windshields of four staff vehicles in a
parking lot there before leaping into a black car and fleeing the
scene after 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The attack followed a similar incident in the early hours of
last Thursday, when a mobile crane was crashed into a guard house
outside Stanley Prison.
</P>
<P>
A Correctional Services Department spokesman said that the
latest attack was not a coincidence or an isolated incident as the
 methods used in the two were identical.
</P>
<P>
The Organized Crime and Triad Bureau has now started
investigation by interviewing prison staff members.

<HEADLINE> China, Russia to Set Up Strategic Partnership: Presidents(2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang pointed out this new type of strategic partnership
towards the 21st century is "a correct historical choice made by
the two countries, which totally accords with the long-term
interests of the two peoples, and with the objective law and
requirements of the world situation and international relations
following the end of the Cold War."
</P>
<P>
As neighbors and permanent members of the United Nations
Security Council, Jiang said, the two nations' increasing mutual
confidence and co-operation of mutual benefits is not only of
significance to China and Russia, but also to the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
He noted, "We sincerely hope that China and Russia as two big
neighbors will remain friendly, respect and trust each other,
co-operate with each other on the basis of equality and mutual
benefit, and achieve common development and prosperity, from
generation to generation."
</P>
<P>
The president stressed the Chinese people wish to be a lasting
"good neighbor, partner and friend" of the Russian people.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the two countries expressed full confidence in
the future for bilateral ties. They concurred that the development
of Sino-Russian ties is not only in accordance with the
fundamental interests of the two peoples, but beneficial to world
peace and stability, as well.
</P>
<P>
On economic and trade co-operation, Yeltsin said considerable
progress has already been made. However, he pointed out, it does
not tally with overall bilateral ties, nor the potential for
future ties, and the co-operation should be increased in the
future.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin said the growth for bilateral trade
volumes has been less than stable, although volumes have picked up
after joint efforts by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
He affirmed that China attaches great importance to the
development of Sino-Russian economic, trade and technological
co-operation, and is ready to encourage major Chinese businesses
to conduct regularized and orderly co-operation in various forms
with their Russian counterparts, earnestly implement the existing
agreements, and expand the scope of co-operation.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president said the agreement on building up trust
on military affairs in border areas, to be signed tomorrow by
heads of state of five countries in Shanghai, is a pioneering
undertaking and of great importance.
</P>
<P>
Agreeing with Yeltsin, Jiang said,"This is a significant move
we have taken to boost mutual trust."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that implementation of the agreement will
promote peace and development in China, Russia, and the
neighboring countries, and friendship among peoples of the five
countries.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia are holding talks on disarmament in border
areas, Jiang revealed, saying he believed the two delegations are
endeavoring to reach an agreement as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"China does not, and will not pose any threat to Russia," the
he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania, UK Investments Pact Endorsed In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzania National
Assembly has ratified an agreement between the Tanzanian
government and the United Kingdom government which seeks to
protect investments of their nationals in either country from
nationalisation.
</P>
<P>
According to a local press report today, the Minister of State
in the President's Office, Daniel Yona, told the house in Dodoma,
central Tanzania, on Wednesday that the agreement was aimed at
giving double assurance to investors from the UK that their
investments in Tanzania would be safe.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which was signed by the two governments on
January 7, 1994, enables the aggrieved party in case of
nationalisation to refer the dispute to the international centre
for settlement of investment disputes.
</P>
<P>
It also stipulates that in case diplomatic efforts to settle
such disputes failed, the two countries would constitute a
special "arbitral tribunal" to resolve the dispute and its
decision would be final.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the agreement offered a "favoured
status" to British investors.
</P>
<P>
He added likewise, Tanzanians who wanted to invest in Britain,
would get the same treatment.
</P>
<P>
Debating the motion, several mps said the government should
enter into such agreement with as many countries as possible.
They said presently, there was stiff competition for investors
among developing countries and Tanzania should not lag behind.

COLOMBO, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan government troops
today killed a Tamil rebel soldier and injured at least 12 others
in their ongoing offensive code-named Operation Riviresa II in the
northern Jaffna peninsula, according to a military spokesman.

<HEADLINE> China, Russia to Set up Strategic Partnership: Presidents (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the issue of Nato's expansion, Yeltsin said Russia strongly
opposes the eastward expansion of Nato, and will take appropriate
measures. Nato's eastward expansion will lead to a split of Europe.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin expressed a full understanding, and
support for Russia's stand on NATO's eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of military blocs since the start of cold war
does not tally with the tide of global development, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin expressed the view that Russia gives strong backing to
the principle of "one China", and regards Taiwan as part of
China. It will not have any forms of official relationship with
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Russia's position on the issue of Tibet is resolute and
clear-cut, that is, Tibet is inalienable part of the Chinese
territory. Jiang expressed appreciation for Yeltsin's statements
on Taiwan and Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Referring to international development, the Chinese and Russian
presidents agreed that all kinds of forces had become divided and
realigned since the end of cold war, especially in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The trend of global multipolarization has accelerated. The
dominant theme of the current global development is to seek an
international environment of peace and stability, promote domestic
development and international cooperation, and solve disputes
through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
However, the world is far from tranquil. The trend, in which
some forces run counter to the historical tide, cling to the idea
of cold war, pursue hegemonism and power politics and interfere in
the internal affairs of other countries under various pretexts, is
expanding.
</P>
<P>
These factors have formed the major source of instability and
tension among nations.
</P>
<P>
The two sides proposed to set up a fair and rational new
international political and economic order, centered around the
principle of equality, mutual respect of each other's sovereignty
and territorial integrity, non-aggression, non-interference in
each other's internal affairs, and the people of a country have
right to choose its own social system and the road of development
in accordance with its own situation.
</P>
<P>
Both sides shared the view that the Korean Peninsular will
maintain a state of peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China supports Russia's entry into the Organization
of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC).
</P>
<P>
The issue of Chechennya is the internal affair of
Russia. Foreign forces should not interfere in it, the Chinese
president said. Yeltsin expressed appreciation.
</P>
<P>
Prior to their talks, Yeltsin laid a wreath at the Monument to
the People's Heroes in Tiananmen Square in Beijing.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan Government has
admitted that the controversy anti-AIDS drug Pearl Omega works.
</P>
<P>
However, the government said the drug need more clinical
trials before it can be used widely for the treatment of
patients.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read in Parliament on Wednesday by Assistant
Minister of Health Basil Criticos, the government said it
supported the clinical trials being conducted in accordance with
World Health Organisation (WHO) requirements.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the drug's inventor Prof Arthur Obel was condemned.
But in yesterday's statement, the Kenyan Government said Pearl
Omega researcher Prof Arthur Obel, should be supported, not
condemned.
</P>
<P>
The statement is the most decisive yet issued in support of
Prof Obel and the news drug, which has been mired in controversy
since reports of its existence emerged three months ago, "Daily
Nation" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Obel has announced he has cured with Pearl Omega about
500 patients who were HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
The Assistant Minister revealed that as a protease inhibitor,
Pearl Omega interferes with the replication of the HIV virus
which causes AIDS, thus rendering the virus non-infectious
without affecting the host cells.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Labor Ministers Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The 11th Meeting of ASEAN Labor
Ministers opened here today for another round of talks on
cooperation to upgrade regional labor standards.
</P>
<P>
In his key-note address at the opening session, Thai Deputy
Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh emphasized human resources
development and regional cooperation on extensive employment
within the region.
</P>
<P>
He also said the development of skills, the raising of the
standard of working conditions, working relations and information
network would enhance the ability of the workforces of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
The highlight of the two-day meeting will be a strong position
taken by ASEAN against attempts by some developed countries to
link trade to social issues related to labor practices.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN views the linkage, raised by mostly developed countries,
as a strategy to block the grouping's exports from gaining access
to their markets.
</P>
<P>
Developed nations, however, claim that they are only trying to
promote labor rights at the international level.
</P>
<P>
Other discussions will focus on intra-ASEAN cooperation in
promoting self-employment, the establishment of an ASEAN training
and information center, ASEAN industrial relations program, and
ASEAN human resources and development program.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN is working towards establishing a uniform labor standard
within the grouping in response to the ever increasing mobility of
labor in the region. Tens of thousands of Thai and Philippine
workers are employed in other ASEAN countries, such as Malaysia
and Singapore.

<HEADLINE> International Financial Institutions Face Declined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Multilateral financial
institutions, like the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank,
are facing decreasing resources from donor countries.
</P>
<P>
Harold Messenger, visiting director of Asia Technical
Department of the World Bank, told a press briefing today that the
volume of the World Bank's lending facility under the
international development assistance (IDA) is declining.
</P>
<P>
Because some shareholders of the World Bank, like the United
States, refuse to infuse fresh funds into the facility, he added.
</P>
<P>
The IDA is lent to poor countries at zero interest rate and
payable in 40 years, with a 10-year grace period.
</P>
<P>
According to Messenger, the Asian Development Bank is also
faced with the same predicament with the Asian Development Fund
(ADF) running out of contribution.
</P>
<P>
The ADF is lent at zero-interest rate with longer maturities to
poor countries.
</P>
<P>
Due to their dwindling funds, both the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank have become more selective in choosing projects
eligible for the IDA and ADF.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Development Bank intends to ask newly-industrialized
economies in Asia, like Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand, who were
once beneficiaries of cheap financing, to start contributing to
the ADF.

JOHANNESBURG, April 25 (Xinhua)-- Lesotho Prime Minister Ntsu
Mokhehle said yesterday he had granted general amnesty to members
of factions in the country's security forces, the local daily the

<P>
Addressing parliament in the capital Maseru on Wednesday,
Mokhehle said amnesty would be granted to members of the defence
force, the royal Lesotho mounted police, the national security
service, the prisons service, the Lesotho liberation army and the
military wing of the Basutoland Congress Party.
</P>
<P>
''The government of Lesotho has decided to grant amnesty after
consideration of the advice of the committee set up between the
Lesotho defence force and army officers from South Africa,
Botswana and Zimbabwe,'' said the prime minister, adding the time
to turn a new page had arrived.
</P>
<P>
However, Mokhehle said people guilty of murder would not be
given amnesty.
</P>
<P>
Mokhehle added that a temporary amnesty in terms of which all
people who had illegal firearms could hand their weapons to the
police had also been announced. Heavy penalties would be imposed
on those who did not hand in their weapons.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Foreigners in Kuwait to Pay Part of Their Medical Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Health Minister Abdulrahman Al-Muhailan said the bill, which
was first proposed one year ago but failed to be passed by the
parliament because of strong opposition, was now in the Council of
Ministers and may be passed within this year.
</P>
<P>
Under the Health Insurance Scheme, foreign nationals living in
the country will also be required to pay an annual premium of
between 50 to 60 dinars or about 165 to 198 dollars per
individual, Al-Muhailan said.
</P>
<P>
The bill needs to be passed first in the cabinet and then by
the parliament before it is implemented in this high welfare state.
</P>
<P>
The health minister's statement was carried in today's
English-language newspaper Arab Times.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has so far been implementing a free medical care system
both for the Kuwaits people and foreign nationals living in the
country.
</P>
<P>
According to the newest official statistics, there are now 1.6
million people living in Kuwait enjoying free medical care.
</P>
<P>
Medical services in Kuwait are at a cost of approximately 300
million Kuwaiti dinars or 990 million U.S. dollars per year.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that implementation of the Health Insurance
Scheme is inevitable and it is "the only feasible way to stop this
figure from soaring and to put an end to the misuse of health
services."
</P>
<P>
Saying that the scheme will only apply to expatriates holding
Kuwaiti residency ID, the minister indicated that there will also
be an insurance system to be set up for Kuwaitis.
</P>
<P>
"We are thinking of charging Kuwaitis a minimal amount for
seeking doctors as well," he added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President on Four-Point Foundation of Sino-Russian Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said in Beijing today that both the Chinese and Russian people are
cherishing the hope that the two countries will become "good
friends, good neighbours and good partners."
</P>
<P>
"I think that several big elements are playing a leading role
in determining a continuous friendly relationship between the two
countries," Jiang said to reporters after his talks with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
"Firstly, China and Russia are the biggest neighbours to each
other," he said while speaking of the four-point foundation of the
Sino-Russian relations, "enhancing mutual trust and maintaining a
stable development of the two countries' relations are in line
with the fundamental interests of the two sides."
</P>
<P>
"Secondly, both China and Russia have huge domestic markets,
and the two countries are deepening their economic reforms," he
noted, "and this has offered a new opportunity for the two
countries to cooperate"
</P>
<P>
"Thirdly, both countries are big countries in the world and
permanent members of UN Security Council," he said, "the two
countries' concerted efforts in promoting world peace and
development will help the world become more prosperous and stable."
</P>
<P>
"Lastly, having a tradition of friendship between the two
countries, both the Chinese and Russian people are hoping that the
two countries will become good friends, good neighbours and good
partners," he said.
</P>
<P>
"All of these are the leading elements in determining the
direction of the development of Sino-Russian relations," the
Chinese president said.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with President Yeltsin, Jiang said that China
and Russia have proposed a policy of "building up a good
neighborhood for generations to come, based on mutual respect,
mutual trust, equally-benefiting cooperation and making joint
efforts for development and prosperity."
</P>
<P>
"The two countries have also decided to set up the Sino-Russian
Committee for Friendship, Peace and Development," he added, "this
has reflected the sincere desire of both sides for a long-term
friendship."
</P>
<P>
"I believe that as long as both countries follow the Five
Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the established principles
of international law, relations between China and Russia will
surely enjoy a very promising future," he added.

<HEADLINE> China Not Exporting Pirated LDs, Official Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese official said here
today that China-made LDs are mainly sold on the domestic market
and denied the reports by foreign media that China exports large
quantities of LDs.
</P>
<P>
Ren Yuzhan, deputy director of the Audio-Video Department of
the Press and Publications Administration, made his remarks at a
news conference in reply to a question raised by a foreign
reporter, who claimed that China produces millions of LDs and
there are only three million to four million sold in the
country. He asked whether or not China's CD producers have
illegally manufactured and exported LDs.
</P>
<P>
Ren said that though China's designed production capacity of
LDs and VCDs stands at 100 million pieces, only some 30 million
have been produced each year in the past few years, due to
operation undercapacity.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country's demand in this regard is for at least
tens of millions, far more than the three million to four million
as reported by some foreign media organs.
</P>
<P>
During a recent inspection in south China's Guangdong Province,
Ren said, he found that, with the increasing demand on the
domestic market, this year's output of LDs is expected to exceed
those of previous years. He noted that 10 LD producers in the
province manufactured 10 million LDs in the first three months of
this year, most of the products are VCDs and LDs made by domestic
publishing units. Among these products, the majority are VCDs,
including many domestically-made Karaoke VCDs.
</P>
<P>
Ren Yuzhan acknowledged that some of China-made LDs are for
export. These are duplicated products made by domestic producers
who are entrusted by foreign clients taking advantage of the
country's low production costs.
</P>
<P>
He said that China attaches the greatest importance to
investigating export-oriented duplicated products made in China,
for the purpose of curbing exports of pirated LDs.
</P>
<P>
He said that previously it was possible that some foreign
clients produced pirated LDs for export, using counterfeit
authorization certificates. Some localities have withheld pirated
products, Ren said.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has implemented a copyright rectification
system and put into effect a source identification code in all LD
factories, in order to effectively monitor and discover in time
manufacturers of products which infringe copyrights.
</P>
<P>
Supervisors have been stationed in all LD factories, and are
rotated regularly every three months, so as to guarantee proper
supervision.
</P>
<P>
By resorting to these measures, infringements and piracy have
been put under control and there is no such thing as mass exports
of pirated products.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, all LD salons across the country were closed,
and LD production lines of seven factories which had produced
pirated, obscene or pornographic products were also shut down
according to the relevant rules. Those involved in these cases
have been handed over to the judicial authorities, Ren said.

"We agree that China and Russia have a lot in common," Jiang

Principles of Peaceful Co-existence is not only in accordance with
the basic interests and aspirations of the Chinese and Russian
people, but beneficial to maintaining peace and stability in the
world as well as in the region."

the people of the two countries, and world peace and stability."
Yeltsin noted.
</P>

of a new international order, and emphasized no country should
make attempts for a monopoly on world affairs in this new order.

which is a quite new factor in world development."
</P>
<P>
He said bilateral relations had reached a new level, as
evidenced by the joint statement which defined the relations as "a
strategic partnership of equality, mutual confidence and mutual
coordination towards 21st century."

While answering a question on the reaction of Asian countries
to Nato's attempts to expand eastward, Yeltsin said President

BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Song Jian, state councillor and
minister in charge of the State Science and Technology Commission,
met with Pierre David, president of the Ocean Exploitation
Research Institute of France, here today.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting at Zhongnanhai, the location of the State
Council, Song noted that China and France are both large coastal
nations, thus their prospects for co-operation in oceanic
endeavors are wide-ranging.
</P>
<P>
China attaches great importance to such co-operation with
France. Such co-operation has been greatly strengthened since it
began in 1985, Song went on to say, noting that the present visit
provides an opportunity for further growth of such co-operation.
</P>
<P>
David said that Sino-French ocean co-operation used to focus on
such areas as geology and earth science, and this will be enlarged
to cover coastal regions. More and still better co-operation is
also needed in research in the field of ocean ecological systems.
</P>
<P>
The French guests came to China with the French ocean research
ship "L'Atalante", on which 25 Sino-French scientists have been
conducting ocean researches in the east China Sea since April 22,

<HEADLINE> Japan Imports More Gulf Oil in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Japan's oil imports from the
Arab countries, maily in the Gulf, increased some two percent in
1995 than in 1994.
</P>
<P>
According to the Bahrain-based Arab Banking Corporation(ABC),
Japan imported 3.2 million barrels per day of oil from the region.
</P>
<P>
ABC said the Arab share of the total Japanese oil imports rose
to around 70 percent in 1995 from 65 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Among the Gulf countries, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has
remained Japan's main oil partner over the past decade, suppling
Tokyo with some 26 percent of its total crude imports.
</P>
<P>
The report said Saudi Arabia accounts nearly 20 percent and
Oman and Qatar at some six percent.
</P>
<P>
Another 10 percent came from Kuwait and the Neutral Zone, a
small oil-rich strip shared equally by Kuwait and Saudi
Arabia. The remaining eight percent were from Egypt and Yemen.
</P>
<P>
Japan has increased its oil import from the Arab countries
due to its own necessity and the raising Arab production.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's year-on-year inflation
fell as predicted to just over 23 percent last month, the daily
"Herald" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said inflation, for the past three years the scourge of
the private sector, continued with its downward trend in March after
reaching a three-year peak of 28 percent in January this year.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate fell to 26.4 percent in February and was
last month pegged at 23.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, recent increases in fuel prices, medical fees and bus
fares were expected to have a negative effect on inflation, which
could rise to over 26 percent in the next three months, the

<P>
BOGOTA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Faustino Asprilla became the hero
anew when he scored the sole goal of the game as Colombia won the
opener over Paraguay in a World Cup qualifier in Barranquilla,
Colombia, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After a scoreless first half, Asprilla got a pass from captain
Carlos Valderrama and sliced open the Paraguayan defense with a
25-meter shot in the 53rd minute.
</P>
<P>
Asprilla, who played for Newcastle, was failed to add one more
in the last minute.
</P>
<P>
Against Colombia, Paraguay entered the pitch with keen
attention to their defense, aiming to reach the World Cup finals
for the first time since 1986.
</P>
<P>
As their tactics depressed the home side, Jorge Campos missed
the best chance in the first half when he failed to get a cross in
the penalty area.
</P>
<P>
Despite its outings to the last two World Cups, Colombia was
aimed to wipe out memories in 1994 when they were knocked out in
the first round with an own goal put in by Escobar who was later
killed when he returned home.

<HEADLINE> Former PM Rules out Coalition of India's Third Front </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Former Indian prime minister
P.V. Singh said that the Third Front, if voted to power, would not
be able to provide a stable government for the country, the
National Herald reported today.
</P>
<P>
The veteran Janata Dal leader said during a visit to Mumbai
(Bombay) that the National Front-Left Front Combine (the third
front) had the strength to win power but lacked cohesion to lead
the country for a full parliamentary term.
</P>
<P>
The Third Front, comprising parties such as the Janata Dal, the
Samajwadi Party, the Communist Party of India and the Communist
Party of India (Marxist), was formed to confront the ruling
Congress Party and major opposition Bharatiya Janata Party in the
coming general elections beginning April 27.
</P>
<P>
"Even if the third force formed the government after the
general elections, it would last only two years. There would be
again mid-term polls," Singh noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Third Front leaders were ideologically akin
but psychologically not on the same length. He conceded that the
dice was still loaded against them for a variety of
socio-political reasons.
</P>
<P>
Besides, he went on, there was a lack of consensus on the need
to provide a stable alternative to the ruling Congress Party.
</P>
<P>
Unless these differences were sorted out, the Third Force would
not be able to emerge as a viable option for the people, he
admitted.
</P>
<P>
The Janata Dal stalwart predicted a hung parliament resulting
in the formation of a coalition government after the polls.

<P>
KAMPALA, April 25 (Xinhua)-- The rebels of the Lord's
Resistance Army (LRA) will start a ceasefire tomorrow in northern
Uganda, reported the local daily the New Vision today.
</P>

the ceasefire would allow people in northern Uganda to vote
freely.
</P>

He appealed to Ugandans to vote for presidential candidate
Paul Ssemogerere.
</P>
<P>
About 570 LRA rebels have since February this year entered
Kilak County in Gulu District, northern Uganda from Sudan,
committing various crimes to distablise northern Uganda.
</P>

NEW DELHI, April 25 (Xinhua) -- India's Election Commission has
issued an order to ban all processions on May Day in those states
where polling would be held on May 2, the second phase of the
general elections for the country's 11th Lok Sabha (Lower House),
The Patriot reported today.
</P>
<P>
The commission said the celebrations would be allowed provided
that the gatherings are held at factory gates or designated places
in the industrial areas for all of which the requisite permission
has to be obtained from local authorities.
</P>
<P>
These gatherings should not be sponsored by any political party
and would not be used in any manner whatsoever for election
propaganda directly or indirectly, the commission stressed.
</P>
<P>
The commission explained that normally, 48 hours before the
closing of polling time, meetings and processions are not allowed
to be held.
</P>
<P>
Some major Indian states, such as Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh,
Tamil Nadu, Orissa, Karnataka and West Bengal, would have polling
on May 2. In all, polling would be held for 204 of the 543
elective Lok Sabha seats and 233 assembly (state parliament) seats
on May 2.

<HEADLINE> India's Ruling Party Vote May Fall to Historic Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The coming Lok Sabha (lower
house of parliament) elections might see the popular vote for
India's ruling Congress Party declining to 31 percent and its
tally of seats falling between 135 and 150, said a survey
published by the Times of India.
</P>
<P>
These would be the lowest ever for the party, below its
performance in 1977 when it first lost power and managed to get
only 34.5 percent of the vote and 154 seats, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 543 out of the 545 seats in the 11th Lok Sabha will
be contested in the coming elections beginning this weekend.
</P>
<P>
The major opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) along with
its allies is ahead of its rivals and might attain the status of
the largest single party. However, its tally of seats is likely to
be less than 200, at least 70 seats short of a majority.
</P>
<P>
The National Front-Left Front Alliance, with the Janata Dal,
the Communist Party of India and the Communist Party of India
(Marxist) as its main constituents, is likely to improve its seats
tally marginally to around 140. Thus a coalition government seems
inevitable, the shape of which will be dictated by post-election
developments.
</P>
<P>
The survey of 26,700 voters in 80 parliamentary constituencies
was conducted for the Times of India by the Delhi-based research
organization, the Center for Media Studies (CMS).
</P>
<P>
The undecided voters in this survey were 14 percent, much less
than in opinion polls published earlier. This indicates that most
people have made up their minds.
</P>
<P>
CMS conducted the survey across the country over a nine-day
period from April 7 to 15. The data is subject to a margin of
error of 3 to 5 percent.

<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The State Education Commission
announced today that Sino-Russian educational co-operation has
made steady headway in recent years and has good prospects.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992 China has sent 331 students and 26 teachers to
Russia, while 345 students and 96 teachers have been sent from
Russia to China.
</P>
<P>
In the four years Sino-Russian co-operation has developed
extensively, involving scientific research co-operation, and
academic and cultural exchanges.
</P>
<P>
With the support of the two countries' departments in charge of
educational work, so far, more than 50 Chinese universities or
colleges have established direct relations with higher-learning
institutions in Russia in the field of scientific researches,
according to statistics.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the State Education Commission and the Russian Federal
Higher Education Commission signed a deal for higher education
co-operation for 1995-1997.
</P>
<P>
In the same year, the two countries signed an agreement to
recognize each other's academic credentials, which laid a solid
foundation for future Sino-Russian co-operation in the fields of
education, especially in scientific research.

<HEADLINE> Republic Issue For Australia To Be Explored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- To be a republic or to remain
within the British Commonwealth of Nations as it is today -- that
is a question which will be answered by referendum held throughout
Australia sometime in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The current coalition government was reported to begin
preparations for a people's convention, if the convention finds
consensus on the way towards a republic, the outcome will be put
to a referendum.
</P>
<P>
As a first step, the cabinet will consider the method of
electing delegates to the convention. According to local
newspapers today, a discussion paper canvassing the option is
being finalized by the government's republican negotiator, South
Australian Liberal Senator Nick Minchin.
</P>
<P>
The discussion paper will go before the legal and
constitutional committee of the cabinet. The committee is expected
to discuss the issue in about three weeks and to formulate a
recommendation for the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet will have to design an election process for
delegates to the convention and to decide if voting for delegates
and on the republic issue will be compulsory.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the Howard government move on the issue is
to counter the opposition's claims that the coalition would
abandon the push towards a republic.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Howard remains committed to the monarchy but he
has promised to call the people's convention in 1997, which will
lead to a referendum and enable the people to vote for a republic
or keep the status quo.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Iran said that it had arrested
some members of five espionage networks engaged in spying for the
Turkish government, according to today's Tehran Times.
</P>
<P>
The official daily said they were trying to "infiltrate Iranian
Armenians and sow discord among Persians and Azeri nationals."
</P>
<P>
However, the daily gave no specific number of the arrested,
saying that they were arrested in the past three months.
</P>
<P>
The daily revealed that the members of the espionage network
are Iranian nationals, who were directly conducted by Turkish
diplomats residing in Tehran, Tabriz and Orumiyeh.
</P>
<P>
They were engaged in spying for Turkey for a long time with
high wages, the daily quoted a information source as saying.
</P>
<P>
The source alleged that Shooki Kiraji, former Turkish Consul
in Tabriz, was the master of the main espionage network which
intended to create security problems for the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the confession of the arrested, the source said,
Kiraji was a veteran Turkish spy who tried to identify and hire
suitable agents by masterminding parties and making friendships
with Iranians and Turks residing in Iran.
</P>
<P>
There were also several Turkish diplomats engaged in espionage
for the Turkish government. Further details will be announced
later, the daily added.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Iran had expelled four diplomats from each other's
side on charge of espionage activities one week ago. Now the
relations between the two countries became worse following the
military agreement between Israel and Turkey, under which Israeli
air force are allowed to train in Turkish skies.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Shimon Peres
has expressed satisfaction with the decision taken by the
Palestinian National Council (PNC) to remove clauses in its
National Charter calling for Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
In response to the PNC move, Peres said at a gathering marking
Israel's 48th Independence Day Wednesday night that maybe
ideologically it is the most important change in the century.
</P>
<P>
It shows that Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat has
fulfilled his commitment, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "Look at the difficulties and sacrifices we
had to endure to get to this change."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that there were still people among the Palestinians
who want to and are capable of what he called "murdering the
peace."
</P>

<P>
HONG KONG, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA) has agreed with the Bank of Japan (BOJ) acting an
agent for the Japanese Ministry of Finance to sign a bilateral
repurchase agreement.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is one of the several that BOJ is planning to
enter into with central banks and monetary authorities in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Yam, chief executive of the HKMA, said that the
repurchase agreement would enhance co-operation between Asian
central banks in their efforts to maintain currency stability as
well as to improve liquidity of foreign exchange reserves of
central banks.
</P>
<P>
The HKMA has earlier signed the repurchase agreement with
central banks from Australia, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
According to a HKMA spokesman, a bilateral repurchase agreement
is the simultaneous agreement to buy securities for an agreed
amount of cash and to sell back the same securities at a specific
later date for a specified amount.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that entering into these well-secured
agreements with central banks, whose credit standings are
generally higher than those of private sector banks, would improve
liquidity of the central banks under minimal risk.

BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- China and Russia stated their
positions on issues concerning the United Nations in a joint
statement signed by presidents of the two countries here today.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agree to strengthen cooperation in enhancing the
U.N. efficiency and ability for action, the joint statement says.
</P>
<P>
They point out that the U.N. has contributed to maintaining
international peace and security. They believe that the
U.N. constitutes a unique mechanism in co-operation for peace,
development and security and, therefore, shoulders a mission of
facing up to global challenges in the 21st century, according to
the joint statement.
</P>
<P>
In order to adapt itself to the changed international situation
and to increase efficiency, the U.N. and its agencies should
conduct appropriate reforms so as to better perform the duties
entrusted by the U.N. Charter. The work and decision-making
process of the U.N. should give better expression to the common
desire and collective will of all the U.N. members, the statement
says.
</P>
<P>
The two sides believe it necessary to further enhance the
efficiency of the U.N. peace-keeping operations, and are ready to

peace-keeping operations should, based on the U.N. Charter,
strictly abide by the important principles of agreement among all
parties concerned, impartiality, neutrality, non-interference in
other's internal affairs and non-use of force except self-defense,
according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
In carrying out the peace-keeping operations, there should be
no dual standards and operations should be under no circumstances
lead to expansion or escalation of conflicts. The imposition of
sanctions must be handled with prudence and the negative
consequences arising from sanctions in the international practice
be given due attention, the statement says.
</P>
<P>
The two sides hold that in maintaining the U.N. Security
Council taking the main responsibility for safeguarding world
peace and security and in accordance with Chapter VIII of the
U.N. Charter, efforts should be made to promote co-operation
between the U.N. and regional organizations in preventing and
mediating peacefully disputes and conflicts, and to promote more
constructive and healthy coordination in the operations between
the non-governmental organizations engaged in the economic and
social development, humanitarian assistance and other areas, the
U.N. and other specialized agencies in the above areas, according
to the statement.
</P>
<P>
The two sides stand for the establishment of a new
international economic order on the basis of fair and

<HEADLINE> US Urged to Comply With Sino-US IPR Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- An official of the Chinese
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (MOFTEC)
here today urged the US government to comply with the Sino-US
Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Agreement as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yuejiao, director-general of the Department of Treaties and
Laws of MOFTEC made this remark in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
She said that since the signing of the Sino-US IPR Agreement in
February last year, Chinese legal departments, such as judicial,
customs, industrial and commercial administration bureaus and
copyright departments, have fully and earnestly fulfilled their
duties stipulated in the agreement by launching a campaign to
crack down on work units and individuals who produced and sold
pirated products.
</P>
<P>
The campaign has effectively curbed various illegal activities
infringing IPR, the official noted.
</P>
<P>
She said that, according to the agreement, the US government
promised to offer assistance to China for the protection and
implementation of IPR, including providing training and relevant
technical equipment; exchanging information about the legal
protection of IPR in foreign countries; effectively protecting
Chinese IPR, and providing information and statistics on the
infringement of Chinese IPR in foreign countries; asking foreign
copyright owners to protect their rights according to law,
preventing and curbing counterfeit authorization, and bringing
lawsuits against people who have infringed upon IPR through legal
procedures; and supporting China's entry into the World Trade
Organization with real actions.
</P>
<P>
However, one year has passed but the US government has not
carried out its duties in this regard, Zhang Yuejiao said, and so
the Chinese government is again urging the US to comply with the
Sino-US IPR Agreement and fulfill its pledges as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Chinese legal departments completed rectification and
investigation of CD and VCD production lines across the country
before March last year, revoking the licenses of seven factories
which had violated copyrights and closing down all the LD salons
in the country.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Hold 1st Solar Boat Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Australia will hold its first
international solar boat race Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 29 boats powered by non-polluting energy will take
part in the race on Lake Burley Griffin in Canberra, national
capital of the country.
</P>
<P>
The entrants are from Australia, Germany and Denmark.
</P>
<P>
The race is part of the ongoing Australian Science Festival
which was launched by Federal Minister for Science and Technology
Peter McGauran Friday and will end Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Race adviser Hans Tholstrup said that the boat race is a most
exciting innovation in a world-wide search for renewable energy.
</P>
<P>
Most of the boats are solar powered, including a lightweight
boat specially designed for the race by a catamaran firm in
Tasmania.
</P>
<P>
A trimaran developed by the Australian Maritime Services
Authority (AMSA) is powered by a 1500-watt engine run by 48 solar
panels.
</P>
<P>
A middle school from South Australia also presents its "Sunboat
II" which sleeps seven people and took 100 people over nine months
to build. The 11.2-meter-long boat set a world record recently by
sailing 2,500 km on River Murray.
</P>
<P>
"Compared with solar car, the boat has many advantages
including fewer building costs and speedier commercial returns,"
Tholstrup said.
</P>
<P>
He said that solar powered boats had a more immediate
commercial prospect than solar cars.
</P>
<P>
"Boats for recreation, fishing or even tourist boats may be
used as the sun takes them along for a quiet holiday on a lake,
river or dam. Even ocean travel is not excluded.

<HEADLINE> 2nd U.N. Environmental Conference to be Held Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The second United Nations
environmental conference will be held here in the first quarter of
1997, said Maurice Strong, a special advisor to the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports today, Strong will meet in the
Brazilian capital of Brasilia with President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso to confirm the exact date of the conference.
</P>
<P>
Strong, now visiting Brazil in his capacity as the president of
the Earth Council, was the secretary-general of the United Nations
Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in June 1992.
</P>
<P>
The first U.N. conference on environment, also popularly known
as the Earth Summit, drew 117 heads of state or government from
around the world to this second-largest Brazilian city.
</P>
<P>
During the gathering, participating nations worked out a plan
of action called "Agenda 21," which calls for concerted efforts
worldwide to protect environment for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they drafted two more documents -- the Framework
Convention on Biological Diversity and the Framework Convention on
Climate Change -- to address specific problems facing the world.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts said, despite the political commitments by
world leaders at the meeting, much of the environmental protection
measures discussed at the time are yet to be put into action.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, they noted, the meeting next year is expected to
review the developments in the past four years and help bring
momentum to the environmental protection course.

<P>
The two sides are of the view that today's world is in the
process of undergoing profound and complicated changes. The trend
toward a multipolar world is developing, and the desire for peace,
stability, cooperation and development has constituted the
mainstream of the present international life. However, the world
is far from being tranquil. Hegemonism, power politics and
repeated imposition of pressures on other countries have continued
to occur. Bloc politics has taken up new manifestations. World
peace and development still face serious challenges.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia, which made enormous contributions to and
sustained major national sacrifices in the final victory over the
dark forces of fascism, call upon the countries in the world to
draw lessons from the history, always bearing in mind the scourges
of war and cherishing the hard-won peace. The two countries wish
to join the rest of the world in a concerted effort to win lasting
and stable peace for both the current generation and the future
posterity.
</P>
<P>
The two sides call upon all peace-loving countries and peoples
throughout the world to cooperate closely and work together to
establish a just and equitable international political and
economic order and promote regional and global peace, stability,
development and prosperity on the basis of the principles of
mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual
non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs,
equality and mutual benefit and peaceful coexistence, as well as

<HEADLINE> Chechen Rebel Leader Buried, Reports Say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Chechen rebel leader Dzhokhar
Dudayev has been buried, while rebels vowed to avenge his death,
Russian news agencies said today.
</P>
<P>
Dudayev, who was killed in a rocket attack by Russian troops
Sunday, was buried secretly Wednesday in the village of Shalazhi,
35 kilometers southwest of Chechnya's capital Grozny, the
Itar-Tass news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Dudayev's successor Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev as
saying only Dudayev's close relatives had attended his funeral and
they decided not to disclose the location.
</P>
<P>
Yandarbiyev, vice president of the self-styled breakaway
Chechen republic before being elected to succeed Dudayev on
Tuesday, also said the fight for independence would go on.
</P>
<P>
Dudayev's representative in Moscow told the Interfax news
agency that the independence struggle would continue "with tripled
energy" and supporters of Dudayev vowed to avenge his death.
</P>
<P>
Dudayev's self-claimed government said the 52-year-old leader
had seriously wounded by a air rocket attack in the village of
Gekhi-Chu, about 30 kilometers south-west of Grozny, as he
stood in an open field speaking by satellite telephone. He died
later in the night.
</P>
<P>
But Russian officials said they were not sure of Dudayev's
death and wanted to see his body to verify the report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Russian military sent conflicting messages on
whether the death of Dudayev, Russia's most wanted man, was the
work of its soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The Russian commander in Chechnya, General Vyacheslav
Tikhomirov, denied Russian forces' involvement in the
death. "Federal forces had nothing to do with the death of
Dzhokhar Dudayev," he was quoted by Tass as saying.
</P>
<P>
But an unidentified Interior Ministry officer told Itar-Tass
Dudayev was killed in a series of calculated air raids in
retaliation for the Chechen ambush last week, during which 73
Russian soldiers were killed and 52 wounded.
</P>
<P>
Dudayev had successfully evaded Russian forces since
fleeing Grozny after it fell early last year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said the situation in the breakaway republic
would become more complicated after Dudayev's death and was
unlikely improve in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Dudayev, a former Russian general, declared the southern region
of Chechnya independent in 1991. The armed conflict erupted in
December 1994 when Moscow sent troops and tanks to put down
Dudayev's secessionist movement. The war has claimed the lives of
30,000 people including many Chechen civilians and fighters on
both sides.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A Colombian senator
accused of receiving drug money in the 1994 election campaign gave
himself up today.
</P>
<P>
Armando Holguin Sarria is the seventh Liberal legislator to be
arrested under the orders of the Supreme Court of Justice for
alleged involvement in the illegal funding of the election
campaign.

Accompanied by two officials from the Prosecutor's
investigation department, Senator Holguin Sarria entered the
penitentiary school in Bogota this morning after a warrant for his
arrest was issued Tuesday, the television news program "24 Hours"

</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court said the senator was implicated of receiving
money from the Cali cocaine cartel after the accounts of Miguel
Rodriguez Orejuela, the jailed Cali chief, were seized in June
1994.
</P>
<P>
The books, found in a raid on the office of the cartel's
accountant Guillermo Pallomari, showed a contribution of more than

<HEADLINE> Clinton Sees Cease-Fire Close in Southern Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
believes that a cease-fire to end the fighting between Israel and
the Hezbollah guerrillas in southern Lebanon is "quite close."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the start of a White House meeting with Lebanese
President Elias Hrawi, Clinton said, "I've gotten some encouraging
news that I can't announce now."
</P>
<P>
He was apparently referring to the progress in Secretary of
State Warren Christopher's peace shuttle mission in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
Christopher said in Beirut today that "although difficult
problems remain, we are drawing closer together and some of the
gaps have been narrowed."
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Clinton promised emergency aid to Lebanon,
which has suffered hundreds of civilian casualties and material
damage in the fighting. Tens of thousands of people also have to
flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese leader is in the United States to address the
U.N. General Assembly, which began debating the Lebanon situation
Tuesday. Clinton invited him here for talks on the crisis in his
war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
"I did not come for humanitarian aid. I came for political
assistance to establish peace," the Lebanese president said.
</P>
<P>
He also said he sensed a "very serious" desire by Clinton to
bring about a cease-fire, but he made it clear that he was
interested in "action on the ground."
</P>
<P>
He asked Clinton to support the implementation of
U.N. Resolution 425 calling for the withdrawal of Israeli troops
from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he had tried to be "an honest arbiter."

<HEADLINE> Australia to Legislate on Change of National Flag </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The coalition government of
Australia is to introduce legislation to protect the national flag
from being changed as soon as the federal parliament resumes next
week.
</P>
<P>
"The new federal government is to take action, as promised, to
protect our great national symbol, the Australian Flag," Prime
Minister John Howard said in a statement today.
</P>
<P>
"Legislation will be introduced early in the life of the new
parliament, which resumes on Tuesday, to ensure that the
Australian Flag cannot be changed without the approval of all of
the Australian people voting at a referendum or plebiscite," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said no political party and no special interest group would
be able to tamper with the design of the national flag.
</P>
<P>
The Liberal-National coalition opposes the former Labor
government's proposal to change the national flag as part of
Labor's push for a republic. Coalition leader John Howard has
promised in the election campaign to protect the flag that has the
Union Jack on it.
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Minister Paul Keating suggested that an Australian
republic should have its own flag to replace the existing one.
But he later abandoned the move because opinion polls showed that
people, especially young Australians, are increasingly supportive
for the existing flag.
</P>
<P>
Howard, who claimed himself as an "unashamed and passionable
supporter" of the present flag, vowed to set up a people's
convention on the republic and other constitutional issues by
legislation soon. Half of the convention delegates are expected
to be elected by voters early next year. The convention is
expected to be held late next year.
</P>
<P>
Howard is personally committed to a constitutional monarchy
with the British Queen as the head of the nation. His coalition
parties are set to oppose any republic move in the people's
convention.
</P>
<P>
Howard's statement was strongly criticized by Ausflag, a group
which is pushing to change the flag by 2000.
</P>
<P>
"The flag has changed about five times since Captain Cook, but
they have never to impose such harsh tactics. This is
unprecedented within the Commonwealth of nations and is
unnecessary," Ausflag Executive Director Harold Scruby said.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Labor leader Kim Beazley said that former Prime
Minister Paul Keating had always said that the flag would only be
changed by referendum.
</P>
<P>
"It is a curious legislative priority for Howard to adopt, given
that there is no mainstream political movement to change the
Australian flag," he said.
</P>
<P>
Former Labor Party leader Keating is a determined advocator of
a republic. In the election campaign, Labor promised to
fast-track the republic issue by holding a referendum on whether
Australia should become a republic or not. It said that a
people's convention would derail the republic move because it was
almost impossible to reach a consensus at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Howard's statement was welcomed by the Australians for the
Constitutional Monarchy Group. Group leader Kerry Jones said that
all Australians needed to be consulted "before any major changes
to the symbols of the national heritage were made.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Democrats, whose support is needed to pass the
legislation in Senate, also expressed support for Howard's plan.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Paraguayan President Juan
Carlos Wasmosy signed a decree this afternoon in Asuncion ordering
army commander General Lino Cesar Oviedo to resign but has not
decided whether to name him minister of defense.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Press Director Edwar Bogado said the appointment
is still "being studied by President Carlos Wasmosy." However,
parliament leader Rafael Casabianca said yesterday that Oviedo
would be the new defense minister.
</P>

Oviedo defied a presidential order issued on Tuesday which
removed him from the military post, triggering a political and
military crisis in this South American country.

The Press Office was quoted by reports reaching here today that
there is no guarantee that Oviedo will be included in the cabinet
due to public anger over his new appointment.
</P>
<P>
The Press Office revealed that the Chamber of Deputies is
clamoring for the resignation of Casabianca whom they blame for
having mediated between Oviedo and Wasmosy for taking a military
officer into the government.

<HEADLINE> Uruguayan FM: Paraguayan Crisis Affects MERCOSUR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Uruguayan Foreign Minister
Alvaro Ramos said here today that the crisis in Paraguay will
affect the MERCOSUR, even though it has been averted.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat made this statement shortly before returning from
Paraguay early this morning where he spent eight hours to show the
Uruguayan government's full support to Paraguayan President Juan
Carlos Wasmosy.
</P>
<P>
On April 22, Lino Cesar Oviedo, the then commander-in-chief of
the Paraguayan army, refused to obey Wasmosy's order to resign and
retire. This gave rise to the most serious crisis since the
return of democracy to the country in 1993.
</P>
<P>
After some 30 hours of negotiations and under national and
international pressures, Cesar gave up his leadership to General
Carlos Diaz Delmas this morning in exchange for being named the
defense minister.
</P>
<P>
The foregin minister said the image of the Southern Cone Common
Market (MERCOSUR) would be affected by its political stability at
the negotiating table with other international economic and trade
organizations such as the European Union.
</P>
<P>
"What happened will affect its international image," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
But, on the positive side of the matter, he said the MERCOSUR
has just shown that it is able to react quickly and it is entering
a phase of institutional maturity when Argentina, Brazil and
Uruguay, Paraguay's three partners in the MERCOSUR, made quick and
unanimous reactions to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Asked for his opinion about the result of the crisis, he said
that he was not in a position to comment on President Wasmosy's
decisions which are internal matters.
</P>
<P>
But he pointed out that "the crisis was not establishing clear
game rules and there was a real danger that the government could
have fallen."

<HEADLINE> Sino-Russian Foreign Ministers Have Working Breakfast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen today had a working breakfast with visiting
Russian Foreign Minister Evgeny Primakov here at the Diaoyutai State
Guesthouse.
</P>
<P>
Primakov is here accompanying Russian President Boris Yeltsin
on a three-day state visit to China, which started Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese source quoted Primakov as saying that "President
Yeltsin was very satisfied with the atmosphere of the banquet in
his honor last evening given by Chinese President Jiang Zemin, and
this friendly atmosphere reflects the characteristics of
Russia-China relations."
</P>
<P>
Russia and China share a wide range of common interests and
have no fundamental conflicts, he said, adding that there thus
exist good conditions for further promotion of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Primakov noted that both countries understand the importance of
enhancing bilateral ties. The development of this relationship
represents no expedient step, he said, adding "this point is every
important."
</P>
<P>
"We are full of confidence for the prospect of Russia-China
relations," sources quoted the Russian minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Qian Qichen voiced agreement with Primakov's views, saying the
huge delegation led by President Yeltsin signaled a new level of
Sino-Russian ties, which he called "hard-won results of joint
efforts by both sides."
</P>
<P>
He noted that Sino-Russian relations are oriented towards the
21st century, and China is willing to further strengthen
co-operation in bilateral areas and in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
During the breakfast the two foreign ministers agreed that it
has become an irreversible, objective trend that the world has
been developing towards multipolarization after the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
In this course, they agreed, country-to-country relations
should not follow a policy of confrontation, nor should a country
impose its own opinions upon others.
</P>
<P>
The two sides oppose any country's attempt to interfere in the
internal affairs of other countries and monopolize international
affairs, they said.
</P>
<P>
Also, they agreed that the furthering of a Sino-Russian
constructive partnership is of strategic significance, but the
seeking of comprehensive common interests and closer co-operation
does not mean that the two countries will form an alliance.
</P>
<P>
The development of Sino-Russian relations is not directed
against any third country, and China will not pose a threat to
other countries, the two ministers agreed.
</P>
<P>
The two top diplomats also expressed willingness to further
co-operation between the two foreign offices.
</P>
<P>
Qian briefed his Russian counterpart on the Chinese
Government's principled stand on the Taiwan issue. Towards that,
Primakov expressed full understanding and support.
</P>
<P>
During the breakfast the two sides also exchanged views on
regional and international issues of common concern.

<HEADLINE> Official Says, Ukraine Will Not Stick to Missile Transfer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine will not send all its
strategic nuclear missiles to Russia by the end of 1996 as
Russian President Boris Yeltsin said at the Moscow nuclear summit
because of Russia's failure to provide fuels for Ukraine's nuclear
reactors.
</P>
<P>
Volodymyr Gorbulin, Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma's senior
security advisor said Russia had not provided Ukraine any fuels in
the first quarter this year as promised in a tripartite nuclear
disarmament deal with the United States in January, 1994.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was later amended by the three parties to speed
up the transfer to Russia of all 1,564 warheads in the SS-19 and
SS-24 intercontinental ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
In return for cutting the timetable from seven to three years,
Russia promised to provide the same value of nuclear fuels to
Ukraine.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Myanmar Reforms State Firms to Push Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is reforming its state
economic enterprises as part of the government's endeavor to
promote the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
Since 1989, the government has taken a series of measures
including reducing the number of state firms, improving their
management, dissolving the price control committee, increasing
employees' wages and salaries, and cutting off subsidies to the
state firms, in order to make them compete with the private
business enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The government also privatized state firms by allowing them to
form joint ventures with either foreign firms or local private
investors.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate privatization and marketization, the government
promulgated the State Enterprise Law, defining the specific areas
of business and economic activities that can be undertaken by
private enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In the manufacturing sector, the Myanmar Ministry of Industry,
which has six industrial enterprises with 94 factories -- textile,
foodstuff, pharmaceutical, ceramic, general and maintenance, paper
and chemical plants, had established over 10 joint venture
enterprises with foreign investors as well as with local private
entrepreneurs by the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Other ministries adopt similar ways to partially privatize
their respective enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The government also formed a privatization commission in
January 1995 and designated 51 state firms to be privatized in the
first phase starting with small enterprises and factories such as
textile, foodstuff, matches, machine parts, milk, livestock
breeding, cooking oil and cinemas.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's national economy achieved an average annual growth of
8.2 percent in the last four years (from 1992-93 to 1995-96).
Industry registered a growth of 8.9 percent in 1994-95. The
private sector made a major contribution to this high growth,
according to the official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has set the target of an average annual 7.4 percent
growth of industry in the next five years (from 1996-97 to
2000-2001) which began on April 1.

<HEADLINE> New Railway Link to Link Fujian, Guangdong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, April 25 (Xinhua) -- A new railway line is planned to
link Fujian and Guangdong provinces, official sources said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The line will be 152 km long, starting from Longyan City in the
southwestern part of Fujian and ending at Meizhou City in eastern
Guangdong. Construction will be kicked off in May.
</P>
<P>
The Fujian part of the line will cost about 730 million yuan
and is expected to be completed by 1998, according to sources at
the Fujian Local Railway Construction Company.
</P>
<P>
Southwestern Fujian and eastern Guangdong are the ancestral
homes of some 10 million overseas Chinese. Investment from them
has helped produce rapid economic growth in the area in the last
few years.
</P>
<P>
However, the lack of a rail link has become more and more of an
obstacle to expanding economic ties between the two coastal
provinces in south China, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the new railway line will enable
southwestern Fujian to transport its rich deposits of iron, coal,
limestone, timber and bamboo to the outside and forge closer
economic ties with neighboring Guangdong, Zhejiang, Jiangxi and
Hunan provinces, the sources added.

<HEADLINE> NATO Not to Reduce IFOR Troops Before Bosnian Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) will not reduce the number of Implementation
Force (IFOR) troops before Bosnia holds general elections in late
September, General Klaus Naumann said today.
</P>
<P>
Naumann, chairman of the NATO's military committee, told a
press conference that his committee held a spring session
Wednesday, at which all member nations agreed to maintain the
present number of IFOR troops in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The NATO now has a 60,000-strong multinational force, including
troops from non-alliance countries such as Russia, in the
war-shattered Bosnia, policing the Dayton peace accords which put
an end to years of brutal war there.
</P>
<P>
Naumann said the period between now and September is of major
significance for the NATO to create a safe environment for the
Bosnian elections.
</P>
<P>
He also told the news conference that the NATO would complete
its military restructuring by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring covers such issues as collective defense,
crisis management, peacekeeping and cooperation with central and
east European nations within the framework of partnership for
peace.
</P>
<P>
France also took part in Wednesday's meeting for the first time
since it resumed its membership in the NATO's military committee
in December.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the NATO's military committee briefed
representatives of their partner countries from central and
eastern Europe and the Baltic region on the military exercises
scheduled for 1997.

<HEADLINE> Trade Fairs on the Sino-Kazakhstan Border Booming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Trade fairs in Horgos on the
Sino-Kazakhstan border are booming, dealing in millions of yuan's
worth of goods from all over China, the Commonwealth of
Independent States, and other countries.
</P>
<P>
"I've made a fortune and become one of the richest in my
hometown by doing business here", said a Russian businessman with
pride.
</P>
<P>
"I come here every month and I'm bringing back a truck of
thermos bottle and a truck of slippers this time", he added,
pointing to two container trucks.
</P>
<P>
As a result of construction in recent three years, the
10-hectare Horgos market has become the largest international
trade fair in the hinterland of Euro-Asia, and an important bridge
linking non-governmental trade in the mid and west Asia, said An
Jianzhong, the Director of the Market Management Department.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of business people from China and the Commonwealth of
Independent States come to the market daily, with transactions
estimated at one million yuan. In the first three months of this
year, total transactions topped 34 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
While the market mainly deals in local products, transactions
now include textiles, motor vehicles, steel, cotton, fur and used
metals.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that some 100,000 individually-owned businesses
from the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have become rich through
business activity at the market.
</P>
<P>
The booming border trade has made Horgos the largest port of
entry in China's west, handling about 360,000 entries and exits of
passengers, and two million tons of goods yearly.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate trade, there are regular buses running between
China and Kazakhstan, and an optic fibre cable telecommunication
network linking China with 14 countries in Asia and Europe.

<HEADLINE> EU Calls for Crackdown on Fund Abuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A European Union (EU) official
today appealed for efforts to crack down on the abuse of funds in
EU member states.
</P>
<P>
Klaus Haensch, speaker of the European Parliament, criticized
the 15 member countries for failing to do enough to curb the wave
of fraud.
</P>
<P>
Fraud has become a business more profitable than heroin
dealing, complained the speaker, who was presiding over a
conference on EU fraud.
</P>
<P>
He urged the member countries to drop the "Robin Hood
mentality" and look beyond national interests.
</P>
<P>
According to EU statistics, the amount of frauds uncovered in
1994 was worth 1.3 billion dollars, which amounts to more than one
percent of the EU annual budget.
</P>
<P>
Haensch said EU member states are totally to blame because they
are in charge of the distribution of aid and grants provided
within the EU budget. It is also their responsibility to track
down fraud on national territory, he added.
</P>
<P>
The 15 member countries signed a convention at an EU summit in
Cannes, France, in June to define abuses of EU funds as an
offense, which will be punished by law. But none of the members
has yet ratified.
</P>
<P>
Haensch also complained that money was recovered in only four
out of five cases uncovered.

<HEADLINE> World's Oldest Cement Found in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, April 25 (Xinhua) -- A recent study has found that the
Chinese were using cement on buildings as early as 5,000 years
ago, in the Late Stone Age.
</P>
<P>
Detailed studies by Chinese and Japanese scientists of
neolithic buildings unearthed in Qin'an in northwest China's Gansu
Province, in the late 1970s, revealed that floors of the buildings
were made of a substance that contained elements found in
modern-day cement.
</P>
<P>
The site, which dates back 4,000-7,000 years, contained
remnants of 240 houses, including two with hard, smooth black
floors.
</P>
<P>
Further analyses showed that materials used for the floors,
developed through a process of burning, consist of calcium
silicate, a major ingredient in modern cement, and clearly have
characteristics of cement. Tests of the tensile strength showed
that, even after 5,000 years, the floors are still as strong as
those made of modern cement.
</P>
<P>
Experts, therefore, reached the conclusion that the material is
some kind of ancient man-made cement, which has good insulating
qualities and protection against dampness.
</P>
<P>
Li Zuixiong, head of the Cultural Relics Protection Center of
the Dunhuang Research Institute, said that the material could be
called the ancestor of modern cement, although it is still far
from being the same as cement in today's sense of the word.
</P>
<P>
"It was widely used in the floors of neolithic buildings
unearthed in Qin'an, which suggests a very high degree of skill in
construction," he added, pointing out that the advanced
construction material is closely linked to highly developed
pottery making techniques in the Late Stone Age.
</P>
<P>
"Colored pottery excavated at the site suggest that the
temperature for firing pottery then could have reached some 950 to
1050 degrees centigrade," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to historical studies, the ancient Romans and Greeks
were the first people to learn how to use volcanic ash for
cement. The method of manufacturing cement is believed to have
been discovered by accident, when people living in areas without
naturally-occurring volcanic ash tried to use clay-bearing
limestone as a substitute.
</P>
<P>
The cement used today was invented by the British in the early
19th century.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investment to Back Qinghai's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Qinghai Province
intends to have a total of one billion US dollars in overseas
investment by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Aircraft Firm Rises to Become Global Supplier of Parts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Xi'an Aircraft Co., a former
defense firm in northwest China's Shaanxi Province, has
transformed itself into the largest spare-parts supplier in China
for foreign aircraft manufacturers, the "China Daily" reported
today.
</P>
<P>
In the 1996-2000 period the company will produce fuselages and
wings for the American McDonnell Douglas MD90-30 aircraft,
accounting for 40 percent of the total work involved in making the
plane, General Manager Wang Qinping said.
</P>
<P>
The company will produce 70 percent of the spare parts for
MD90-30s, he said.
</P>
<P>
It expects to earn 50 million US dollars annually in the next
five years, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
In the 1993-1995 period the company earned 15 million US
dollars annually providing spare parts for foreign manufacturers,
Wang said.
</P>
<P>
At present, it is the sole producer of the Boeing 737 access
door, the Boeing 747 wing rip cop, the Boeing 146 access cover as
well as all CL-415 spare parts, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Starting in 1980, the company changed from military production
to making spare parts for civilian use.
</P>
<P>
Its entrance to the world market was marked in September 1980,
when a contract was signed with Canadair to produce spare parts
for CL-215 amphibian planes, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the company has signed 31 contracts worth a total
of 230 million US dollars with the American Boeing Company,
Aerospatiale France, Alitalia of Italy, Deutsche Aerospace and
McDonnell Douglas for production of spare parts for 10 types of
planes, the general manager said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, the company had completed 17 contracts and
produced more than 2,500 spare parts valued at over 100 million US
dollars, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The work for foreign firms has raised the company's production
capacity and technological ability.
</P>
<P>
It has learned metal bonding, a new chemical milling skill, a
shot peening forming and strengthening technique, aluminum alloy
mirror skin and surface repair, and others, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The company has also done its bit to improve itself.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990-1995 period the company invested 300 million yuan
and 20 million US dollars overhauling 20 production lines and
introduced more than 500 advanced processing, testing and
measuring facilities.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 special processing technologies are up to the
standards of the international aircraft companies, Wang said.

<HEADLINE> France Willing to Send Troops to Southern Lebanon: Chirac </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
said today that his country is willing to send troops to southern
Lebanon to help bring peace there.
</P>
<P>
Continued Israeli shelling of the Hezbollah guerrillas in the
area has triggered tension in the Middle East and caused
international concern.
</P>
<P>
If U.N. peacekeepers or national contingents could help stop
the war between Israel and the Hezbollah guerrillas, France is
willing to take part, Chirac told a cabinet meeting today.
</P>
<P>
France is eyeing an agreement that would disarm the guerrillas,
enact the U.N. Resolution 425 on the withdrawal of Israeli troops
from south Lebanon and the posting of Lebanese soldiers along the
Israel-Lebanon border.
</P>
<P>
France is now competing diplomatically with the United States,
Russia and its European Union allies in the Israel-Lebanon crisis.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette, U.S. Secretary of
State Warren Christopher, Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov and Italian Foreign Minister Susanna Agnelli, who is
representing the EU, are all shuttling between actors in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Chirac praised the "tenacious and courageous" efforts of de
Charette and reiterated that France's diplomatic goal was to
"return calm to the Israel-Lebanon border."

<HEADLINE> WWII Warship Models Removed From Shops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The municipal government of
Chongqing, an industrial city in southwest China's Sichuan
Province, has ordered the city's stores to remove models of
Japanese and German WWII warships from their shelves.
</P>
<P>
In early April, a reporter from the Chongqing Evening News saw
plastic models of two WWII Japanese battleships on display in
children's toy departments in two large downtown stores, and wrote
an article criticising them.
</P>
<P>
But the shop ignored it and kept the items, saying that, "The
world is at peace now. It is unnecessary to talk about the past
all the time."
</P>
<P>
So, on April 20, the municipal authorities convened an
emergency meeting, and decided that city departments should take
immediate action to halt the sales.
</P>
<P>
In the ensuing search of shops and wholesale markets, some 250
warship models were confiscated by the city's industrial and
commercial administrative bureau.
</P>
<P>
The bureau's chief said that the search will go on until all
"invaders' warships" disappear from the market.
</P>
<P>
After the story hit the news, sellers of WWII Japanese warships
came under heavy criticism by local citizens, especially
historians and school teachers, who called it an insult to the
nation's feelings and dignity.
</P>
<P>
"We shall never forget the countless crimes the Japanese
invaders committed against our people in World War II," Song
Xinghua, associate professor of history at Chongqing Normal
College, was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Albanian President Concerned About Kosovo Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Albanian President Sali Berisha
issued a statement today calling on all the political factions and
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo to show restraint after an ethnic
Albanian student was killed in the region.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Kosovo, an Albanian-dominated region in the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, became tense after an ethnic
Albanian student was killed by a bomb on April 21 in Prishtina,
capital of Kosovo, according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
On the following day, five Serbian people were shot dead and
four wounded in the city. The authorities immediately arrested a
group of ethnic Albanians, making the tense situation there worse.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Berisha accused some Serbian extreme
nationalists of engaging in violent and terrorist acts in the
region and asked the international community to take effective
measures to help solve the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
The solution of the Kosovo issue is the precondition for
realizing peace and stability in the Balkans, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Relations between ethnic Albanians and Serbians have long been
tense in the region.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, ethnic Albanians there proclaimed an independent
"Republic of Kosovo" in an attempt to break away from the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Forest Fires Widespread in Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-seven forest and
grassland fires are raging in all 10 Mongolian provinces except
one, killing one people, injuring 16 and displacing more than 300
others.
</P>
<P>
More than 4,000 personnel and 200 vehicles have been mobilized
to put down the fires, Foreign Ministry spokesman Tsolmon told a
news conference today.
</P>
<P>
He said details of the overall damage are not immediately
available but said reports from across the country showed 3
million hectares of forests and 5 million acres of pastureland are
ablaze.
</P>
<P>
Bayar, member of Mongolia's National Standing Special
Committee, also told the press conference that the latest forest
fire broke out Monday in a large area of Dornod Aimak Province
bordering China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
He said the conditions of the fire were not yet known because
the telephone links between the capital and the province have been
cut off after the fire burned down 250 wire poles.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, forest fires in the northwestern Khobsgol
and Bulgan provinces continued to spread.
</P>
<P>
The government will meet Friday to discuss how to mobilize all
walks of life in the rescue operation and to decide whether to
appeal for international emergency assistance.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen percent of Mongolia, the world's largest land-locked
country of about 1.6 million square kilometers, is covered with
forest. Its grassland makes up 80 percent of the country, or 124
million hectares, ranking sixth in the world.

<HEADLINE> China's Development Beneficial to Whole World: Dutch PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE HAGUE, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok
said today China's rapid development will benefit the whole world
and the two countries should enhance cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China's development doesn't, as some people believe, pose a
threat to the rest of the world, Kok told a delegation of Chinese
mayors led by Beijing vice mayor Jin Renqing.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister recalled his visit to China last year and
highlighted the frequent exchange visits by officials of both
sides which he said were very important.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister
Qian Qichen held productive talks with his Dutch counterpart, Hans
van Mierlo in The Hague last week.
</P>
<P>
Kok said that although Holland and China face different
conditions, there is great potential for a wide range of
cooperation. He hoped the two sides will explore new ways of
cooperation and said the visit of the Chinese mayors was a good
example of this.
</P>
<P>
Jin agreed with Kok and promised to expand cooperation between
his city and the Netherlands.

<HEADLINE> Paraguay: Renegate General Surrenders Army Command </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Renegate General Lino Oviedo
surrendered today his command of the Paraguayan army to General
Oscar Diaz Delmas in the first step to resolve the
political-military crisis in that country.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here from the Paraguayan capital
of Asuncion, President Juan Carlos Wasmosy gave General Oviedo an
"abrazo" in the ceremony in which the command of the army was
transferred.
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, Wasmosy announced the designation of Oviedo as
minister of defense upon his retirement since the constitution
stipulates that a military officer in active service cannot
occupy that post.
</P>
<P>
General Oviedo refused to obey the presidential order to hand
over the army command and go into retirement, thus sparking the
biggest political-military crisis in the South American country
since 1994.
</P>
<P>
After a dialogue with President Wasmosy, General Oviedo agreed
to resign from his military post to occupy the civilian one.
</P>
<P>
However, different sectors in Paraguay have showed their
displeasure over Wasmosy's solution of the crisis, alleging that
it was a concession to the military in the country's democratic
process.

<HEADLINE> Cuba's Sugar Production Reaches 4 Million Tons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Cuba's sugar production has
reached four million tons this season, up 20 percent from last
year's harvest, the Cuban government said today.
</P>
<P>
It said the production can reach 4.5 million tons in May, a
month before the current season ends.
</P>
<P>
Sugar is Cuba's biggest export, which suffered great setback in
1995. Fifty-five percent of Cuba's arable land grows sugar cane,
but the production last year was merely 3.3 million tons, the
lowest in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban daily Granma said the growth in sugar production, a
major source of income, helps revitalize the stagnant economy of
the Caribbean island.

<HEADLINE> Third Round of Iraq-UN Oil Talks Fail to Reach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The third round of the
Iraq-U.N. talks on an oil-for-food deal under U.N. resolution 986
ended here today without reaching an agreement.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. resolution, Iraq is allowed partial oil sale for
its people to buy food and medicine. Iraq said that the fourth
round of talks will be held in the beginning of May.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz was quoted by Iraqi News
Agency (INA) as saying that because of the American and British
intervention in the talks, Iraq and U.N. could not reach an accord
in the third round of talks.
</P>
<P>
Aziz told INA that at the start of the talks, Iraq and the
U.N. were sorting things out in a practical and professional
manner, and there was a serious chance for reaching a balanced
accord.
</P>
<P>
"However, American and British intervention in the course of
talks foiled this chance, accordingly, the U.N. side backed down
twice successively on issues already agreed upon in the objective
and balanced manner," Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali had
already obtained the mandate of the Security Council to hold the
talks with Iraq and had been given the full authority to conclude
an accord with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"However, the American and British sides have violated this
mandate and have directly intervened in the details of the talks,
hence an accord and understanding during the third round of talks
could not be achieved," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Iraq will go on working for reaching an accord
with the U.N. that will not violate Iraq's sovereignty and
threaten the national unity.
</P>
<P>
He added that at the same time, the accord will answer to the
concerns of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Aziz affirmed that American and British intervention in the
Iraq-U.N. talks will continue to constitute a serious threat to
the forthcoming talks. He called on other U.N. Security Council
members to prevent both the U.S. and Britain from intervening in
the course of the talks in the future.
</P>
<P>
He said that both Washington and London have ill-intentioned
political goals, which ran counter to the U.N. Charter and norms
of the international law.
</P>
<P>
The third round of the talks started on April 8 with prevailing
optimism among Iraqis, who are anxious for a positive outcome of
the talks that could hopefully alleviate their sufferings under
U.N. sanctions imposed on the country for its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.

MADRID, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Both Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario and
Conchita Martinez, the top two tennis players in Spain, have bowed
out of the squad on Wednesday for its first-rounder against South
Africa this week in the Federation Cup.
</P>

pesetas (80,000 US dollars) while the Federation offered 7 million
pesetas (55,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Following their withdrawal, Spain will field in Virginia Ruano,

<HEADLINE> Christopher Holds Talks with Lebanese Leaders on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHITAURA, LEBANON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of
State Warren Christopher held talks here today with Lebanese House
Speaker Nabih Berri and Prime Minister Rafik Al-Hariri on the
ongoing Israeli aggression against Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference following the talks, Christopher said
that "the most important thing to do is to end the fighting
(between Israel and Hezbollah) and let the Lebanese civilians
return to their homes."
</P>
<P>
The talks between the two sides started at 5:30 p.m. (14:30
GMT) and lasted for 90 minutes in the city of Chitaura, 45
kilometers east of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Chitaura, situated on the western edge of Lebanon's eastern
Beqaa Valley, is only 20 kilometers west of the Syrian border.
</P>
<P>
Christopher told reporters that he came to Lebanon to
"demonstrate the America's deep concern over the sufferings of
the Lebanese people and to reaffirm the U.S. support of
Lebanon's independence, sovereignty and territory integrity."
</P>
<P>
He said Washington was taking initial steps to deal with the
most emergency humanitarian needs, including the provision of
medical supplies and a one-million U.S.-dollar contribution to
the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary of state came here this afternoon from
Damascus where he held hours of talks with Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad on the Lebanese situation.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Berri stressed that today's meeting in
Chitaura was aimed at "exploring an end of the (Israeli)
aggressions on the Lebanese lands."
</P>
<P>
"Of course, we entered details on achieving, at least, a
temporary solution, from which a permanent settlement will be
reached," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the United States and other countries, especially
Syria, are "making efforts" in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Berri said that during the meeting, the Lebanese side
underlined some principles which should be contained in any
agreement. The principles include freeing civilians of any
military strike and any aggression as well as upholding Lebanon's
right to liberate its occupied land.
</P>
<P>
"These things have been raised and discussed in detail, and
we, the prime minister and I, have expressed our views on them to
Christopher," said the Lebanese house speaker.
</P>
<P>
He also called for a "fast end to the bloodshed" in southern
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Berri said he believed that "a result could possibly be reached
with 24 hours." But he said that it would be a "temporary
agreement."
</P>
<P>
Hariri, the Lebanese prime minister, said he wanted to assure
the Lebanese people that "we are looking for a better situation in
Lebanon in the future, in the very next future."
</P>
<P>
He also stressed his concern for achieving "a cease-fire
(between Israel and Hezbollah) as soon as possible and to see the
Lebanese people to live in peace."
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped the "the United State will, as soon as
possible, play the role of stopping this violence where the
civilians are killed."
</P>
<P>
He described today's meeting as "objective," adding that
several points need to be clarified.
</P>
<P>
"We would do our best all together to liberate our occupied
territory," he added.
</P>
<P>
After the joint press conference, Christopher left for
Damascus, then to Israel tonight. He is expected to meet with
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres in Israel and Syrian leader
Hafez al-Assad in Damascus Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary of state is currently in the Middle East on
a trouble-shooting shuttle mission to secure an end to the
fighting between Israel and the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of
God.
</P>
<P>
More than 150 Lebanese people have been killed and hundreds of
others wounded in Israeli bombardments since the Israeli "Grapes
of Wrath Operation" began on April 11.
</P>
<P>
Hearing of Christopher's arrival in Lebanon this afternoon,
dozens of youths who identified them as members of the so-called
"Green Party" staged a sit-in in front of the U.S. embassy in
Beirut.
</P>
<P>
They chanted "Get out, Christopher, and Four Two Five" a
reference to a strongly-demanded implementation of U.N. Security
Council Resolution 425, which calls for an unconditional Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators were dispersed by police only 15 minutes
later. Some of them were arrested and then released.
</P>
<P>
Despite the intensive diplomatic efforts to end the fighting,
the cross-border exchanges of gun-fire between Israel and
Hezbollah were continuing.

<HEADLINE> CBI Survey Shows Gloomy Picture of UK Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- British industry's confidence
dipped for the fourth consecutive quarter and factories shed jobs
at the fastest rate since April 1994.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest quarterly industrial trends survey from
the Conferation of British Industry (CBI), manufacturers have been
facing the slowest growth in exports since the Autumn of 1993.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that manufacturing activity has failed to pick
up and is now at a standstill, with output and total new orders
flat, business confidence continuing to fall and employment in
manufacturing falling at its sharpest rate for two years.
</P>
<P>
The CBI said that 16,000 people had lost their jobs in
manufacturing in the first three months of this year after a fall
of 12,000 in the final three months of last year. It expected a
further 11,000 jobs to be lost in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey of 1,225 companies, 25 percent of
manufacturers said output volume was up over the last four months,
which was matched by 25 percent reporting reduced output.
</P>
<P>
The balance of zero is the first time there has been no net
growth since October 1993.

<HEADLINE> New Round of Rows on Europe Erupts in UK Tories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A new round of rows on Europe
within the British Conservatives has erupted as Prime Minister
John Major launched a fierce defense of the European Union by
attacking the Eurosceptics in his party.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the annual convention of the Institute of
Directors, Major flatly dismissed the notion made by the
Eurosceptics that Britain should withdraw from the 15-state club.
</P>
<P>
Britain should stay on in Europe, Major said, adding that he
did not seek confrontation with the EU.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in recent years, more and more countries in
Europe, including some of the most prosperous, decided to join the
EU. If Britain were outside the EU, the national interest of
Britain would have been severely hit.
</P>
<P>
He described the Eurosceptics as living in "cloud-cuckoo-land".
</P>
<P>
According to press reports here today, 66 Tory members of
parliament showed disdain for the EU by backing a personal bill
made by a backbencher Duncan Smith to limit the power of the
European Court of Justice in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Leading Eurosceptics like John Redwood, former Welsh secretary,
and Norman Lamont, former chancellor of the exchequer, stood
behind Duncan Smith.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Approves Another Temporary Spending Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- With the current stopgap
spending bill for some U.S. agencies expiring at midnight, the
U.S. House of Representatives today adopted a legislation to keep
the government operating for another 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
The stopgap bill, the 13th in fiscal year of 1996, was approved
with a vote of 400-14. It would give the U.S. White House and
Congress a bit more time to reach accord on the budget of the
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate also was expected to approve the temporary bill
and White House Chief of Staff Panetta said President Clinton
would sign it.
</P>
<P>
In talks on the longer-term bill for the remaining five months
of the fiscal year, Panetta and U.S. congressional leaders have
narrowed their differences over environmental provisions and
spending that have fueled a months-long budget battle. But they
failed to eliminate them before the deadline of midnight.
</P>
<P>
The final shape of the 160-billion-dollars measure is still
evolving, but Republican leaders said they planned to take it to
the House and Senate floors on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> UK Referendum Party Chief Keeps up Pressure on Tories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Sir James Goldsmith, leader of
Britain's Referendum party, pledged today to keep his plan to fund
600 candidates in contesting the seats with Tories in the next
general election scheduled for may 1997.
</P>
<P>
John Redwood, former Welsh secretary and Tory leadership
challenger last June, held talks with Goldsmith in a bid to
persuade the billionaire to drop his threat against the
Conservative party, but failed.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Redwood said he had been unable to dissuade
Goldsmith from carrying out his plan.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Major has agreed in principle to hold a
referendum on a single European currency, but has ruled out the
wise plebiscite on Britain's role in Europe, sought by Goldsmith.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with BBC radio on April 15, Goldsmith vowed to
launch a 20 million pounds (30 million U.S. dollars) campaign to
field 600 candidates to contest with Tories in the general
election.
</P>
<P>
He threatened that his candidates will stand in seats where the
conservative candidates oppose a referendum on Europe.
</P>
<P>
Tories feared that the Referendum party could take 15 to 20
seats away from them at the next general election and put Labour
in power.

<P>
NEW YORK, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Blue-chip stocks on Wall Street
fell sharply today, but technology issues rallied again, lifting
the Nasdaq market to its fifth straight record, after another
encouraging earnings report by the computer industry.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 34.69 to close at
5,553.90, amid concerns about the effects of rising interest rates
and inflation on earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a slim margin, with
total volume reaching 493.36 million shares, up from 452.68
million in the Tuesday session.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index fell 0.64 to 348.96. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.41 to 650.17.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 8.78 to 1,175.54, staging
another broad advance and rising more than 7 percent in less than
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index fell
1.68 to 589.05, ending a six-session streak of record finishes.
</P>
<P>
Compaq Computer announced today a strong earnings report,
dispelling further the fears of a sluggish computer industry. The
company said its profit increased 8 percent and sales jumped 45
percent during the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed some of the blue-chip market's decline to
some poor earnings reports, continuing weakness in the bond market
and the dollar's renewed strength against other major currencies.
</P>
<P>
Bonds edged lower, with yieldings climbing above 6.8.
</P>
<P>
Strong economic readings often hurt bond prices, because traders
are concerned that too much growth will cause inflation, which eats
away at the value of fixed income investments.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Slaughter 40,000 Cows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The British government announced
today that it has submitted a new slaughter plan to the European
Union (EU) in a bid to speed up the elimination of BSE or mad cow
disease from British cattle.
</P>
<P>
British Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg was quoted by the BBC
television as saying that under the new plan some 40,000 cows
would be slaughtered. And the plan would also involve tracing all
BSE cases to their herd of origin.
</P>
<P>
"This is a sensible and constructive move which I believe
should be seen as a positive step forward," Hogg said after
sending his proposals to EU Agriculture Commissioner Franz
Fischler.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the new plan should cut BSE by "up to 30
percent" but will only be introduced as part of moves towards
ending the world-wide EU ban on British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
Hogg predicted that the EU ban would gradually be lifted and a
total lifting of the ban would be some way off, adding "It may
well be that we will move step by step".
