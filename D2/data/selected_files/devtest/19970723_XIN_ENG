<HEADLINE> Head of French Employers Group Raps Gov't for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The head of France's national
employers' association CNPF, Jean Gandois, today rapped the
Socialist government for increasing taxes on enterprises to reduce
public deficit.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the daily Le Monde, Gandois said what the
government should do is to reduce France's bloating public
spending, instead of resorting to tax increase as a way to cut
deficit.
</P>
<P>
"In this country, there is an essential problem, that is to
know whether, yes or no, one will decide once for all to reduce
the spending of the state, or if the primary reaction will always
consist of increasing the tax," said Gandois.
</P>
<P>
The government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin announced a plan
to increase 22 billion francs (3.6 billion U.S. dollars) of
corporate tax and capital gains tax on enterprises in a two-year
period of time to help reduce France's public deficit, expected to
stand at 3.5-3.7 percent of its gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
The deficit is higher than the three percent criteria set by
the Maastricht treaty for joining the European single currency at
the beginning of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Gandois appealed to the government to adopt an austerity budget
for 1998 in order to cut public spending to close the Maastricht
criteria, which he said cannot be done in the remaining five
months of this year but can be done next year.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that to increase taxes on enterprises will
discourage investment which is key for resumption of economic
growth and cutting the country's 12.8 percent unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
He said that if one puts together all the taxes imposed on
enterprises, French firms are the most heavily taxed in the world,
while their profits stay lower than half of those of some other
industrial powers.

STOCKHOLM, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Severe flood caused by heavy
rainfall in Poland and Czech Republic in recent weeks is now
affecting the Baltic Sea, according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The ecosystem is being subjected to a terrible shock as high
levels of pollutants kill off oxygen in the water.
</P>
<P>
The wind is expected to change at the weekend when the flood
waters will move towards the southern coast of Sweden. A German
research vessel is waiting at the mouth of the River Oder to test
the contents of the flood water for environmental toxins washing
out into the Baltic Sea.
</P>

It is not yet possible to calculate the scale of the damage to
marine life in the area, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Import-Export Tax Revenue Down Five Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's revenue from import-export
tax in the first six months decreased five percent to 6,500
billion Vietnamese dong (about 560 million U.S. dollars), compared
to the same period last year, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The revenue accounted for 37 percent of the import-export tax
revenue collection target for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
The reduction should be attributed to structural adjustments of
import-export goods with major increases in imports of equipment
and production materials by foreign joint ventures and investment
projects.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, imports of consumer goods were put under tighter
control, including the suspension of imports of fully-assembled
motorbikes and under-12-seat automobiles in mid-April, and the
additional suspension of imports of 12 kinds of consumer goods in
the first quarter of the year.

<HEADLINE> SADC Forecasts Grain Shortfall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Current regional assessments
indicate supply shortfalls on all cereals in the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) except for Zimbabwe and South
Africa, the SADC food security unit said today.
</P>
<P>
Maize, which was in surplus last marketing year, shows a
deficit of 885,000 tonnes, worse than the 783,000 tonnes assessed
in May.
</P>
<P>
The unit said, "Deficits for wheat and rice are down from
earlier assessments, with the wheat deficit substantially reduced
from 1.09 million tonnes to 714,000 tonnes, mostly as a result of
current expectations of higher carry-over stocks as well as
summer wheat production in South Africa."
</P>
<P>
All individual country balances indicated an overall cereal
deficit except for South Africa and Zimbabwe, it said.
</P>
<P>
Due to carry-over stocks from the previous marketing year,
South Africa and Zimbabwe had overall cereal surpluses of 1.15
million tonnes and 201,000 tonnes respectively.
</P>
<P>
There was an indication that the region would need to import
at least 1.75 million tonnes of cereals during the 1997/98
marketing year, the unit noted.
</P>
<P>
"It appears that Angola, Malawi, Mozambique and Tanzania might
have to ask for food aid from the donor community in order to
prevent mass starvation beginning from the middle of the current
marketing year," the unit predicted.

structural reforms.
</P>
<P>
While meeting Zambian Vice President Godfrey Miyanda, Kabbaj

<HEADLINE> Rexrodt Says No to Major German-Canadian Potash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 22 (Xinhua) -- German Economic Minister Guenter
Rexrodt today upheld a decision by Germany's federal cartel office
to reject the planned merger of the German potash producer Kali
and Salz Beteiligungs AG and the Canadian Potash Corporation of
Saskatchewan (PCS).
</P>
<P>
"The significant restrictions on competitiveness were not
outweighed by advantages for the welfare of the whole nation," he
told reporters in Bonn while explaining his decision.
</P>
<P>
Under German law, Rexrodt had the final say on this planned
merger after it was rejected by the cartel office.
</P>
<P>
Bonn's decision has met with criticism from Germany's chemical
giant BASF AG, which said the decision was against protecting jobs
and a serious blow to Germany's potash industry.
</P>
<P>
BASF intends to sell its 76 percent stake in K+S, and believes
the planned merger will promote the company's competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
K+S has 7,500 employees, and comes 4th in the global potash
industry. PCS is the world's number three.
</P>
<P>
The merger plan was announced last August and was criticized by
K+S shareholders at a meeting last May. They said that by this the
Kassel-based company would "be given away for free" to PCS.
</P>
<P>
PCS offered 98 marks for each share, but a shareholders'
spokesman said the true value per share was close to 176 marks.

<HEADLINE> OAPEC Forecasts Increase in World Oil Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwait-based
Organization of the Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC)
has predicted an increase of about 4 million barrels in the
world's oil demand in the last quarter of this year to reach 75.9
million barrels per day (bpd).
</P>
<P>
This was announced by the OAPEC in a specialized monthly
bulletin for July, which is available today.
</P>
<P>
It said that the world oil demand, which stood at 72.3 million
bpd during the second quarter of this year, would increase to an
average level of 73.5 million bpd this year compared with 71.8
million bpd in 1996 and 69.9 million bpd in 1995.
</P>
<P>
World oil reserves has reached its peak of 4,780 million
barrels, the highest since last December. Industrialized nations'
share was estimated at 2,680 million barrels, according to the
bulletin.
</P>
<P>
The world demand on oil has become weak since the start of
this year because of the ending of cold winter in northern
hemisphere and the increase of storage.
</P>
<P>
Oil ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) formally endorsed a quickly-concluded accord on
June 26 in Vienna, Austria, to abide by the production ceiling of
25.03 million bpd, sending a signal to the world oil market that
they are serious about cutting back oversupply to reverse a
downtrend in crude oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Oil industry analysts say abundant supply and weakening demand
have combined to put downward pressure on the world market prices.
</P>
<P>
The oil prices of the OAPEC have been in a falling trend since
the start of this year because of the increase of international
supply and decrease of demand.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Alternate Representative of the
Chinese delegation Mr Liu Xinsheng today welcomed the
General-Assembly's endorsement of Mrs Mary Robinson as the new
High Commissioner for Human Rights, hoping that she will pay more
attention to the views of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"The post of the High Commissioner for Human Rights comes with
a great challenge," Liu said at the 1997 substantive session of
the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) on the issue of human
rights. "In order for it to win the confidence and support of the
international community, the job must be done in adherence to the
principle of fairness, objectivity and independence and in
accordance with the provisions of the UN Charter so as to do
something tangible for the promotion and protection of human
rights."
</P>
<P>
"We sincerely hope that Mrs Robinson will heed the views of
developing countries, adopt concrete actions to meet their
concerns, strive to reduce confrontation and actively promote
international cooperation in the field of human rights," Liu
added.
</P>
<P>
Mrs Robinson has been the Irish President since December 3,
1990. Her nomination as the High Commissioner for Human Rights by
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan was endorsed by the
General-Assembly on June 17. She is going to visit Geneva late
this month and assumes office in September, according to
diplomatic sources here.

<HEADLINE> Volkswagen Bets on Car Boom in Asian-Pacific Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Asia-Pacific region will catch up
with North America in terms of car sales by the turn of the
century and will replace the latter as the world's biggest car
market by the year 2005, Germany'a largest carmaker Volkswagen
predicted today.
</P>
<P>
Betting on a big boom in Asia, Volkswagen today upgraded its
Singapore office to a regional "business headquarters" with an eye
to expand its market position and intensify its services in the
region, the company said.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued by Volkswagen on Tuesday,
the company expects the Asian car market to expand by two million
units over the next five year to a total of 10 million, a figure
comparable to car sales in North America.
</P>
<P>
By 2005, Volkswagen believes that the Asian-Pacific region will
become the world's largest car market.
</P>
<P>
To make full use of the upcoming market opportunities,
Volkswagen plans to use Singapore as a base to manage and
coordinate sales, marketing and services activities of the
company's five brands -- Volkswagen, Audi, Seat, Skoda, and VW
Light Commercials -- in the region.
</P>
<P>
The company also wants to set an new industry benchmark by
launching a spare parts centre in Singapore which could deliver
spare parts anywhere in the Asian-Pacific region within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
Volkswagen's car sales in Asia soared about 21 percent to
194,717 units in the first half of this year, mainly thanks to
strong performance in China and Japan, where the company managed
to sell 142,806 cars and 33,261 cars respectively. For the rest of
the region, however, Volkswagen's sales dropped by about 3.2
percent in the first half, the company said.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Acts to Prevent Violence: Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat is acting to prevent violence
against Israel in order to avoid Israel's severe reaction, a
senior Israeli security official said today.
</P>
<P>
Ami Ayalon, head of the General Security Service (GSS), made
the assessments in his semi-annual security report to the Knesset
(Parliament) Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is interested in controlling the confrontations in the
self-rule territories but opposes organized violent attacks
against Israel, which could be out of control and trigger severe
reaction from Israel. Arafat believed that this approach would
get the peace negotiations back on track, Ayalon said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that extremist Palestinian organizations, such
as the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) and Islamic Jihad, have
established a systematic infrastructure of terrorism and are ready
to launch massive attacks against Israel.
</P>
<P>
The opposition to Arafat is getting stronger and stronger due
to the current stalemate in the peace process, and he is not only
facing pressure from the extremist organizations, but also has a
limited freedom of maneuvering within the PNA, according to Ayalon.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that Israel support the position of Arafat by
taking measures to advance the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Ayalon's report was almost identical to that made recently to
the same committee by Israeli Army's intelligence chief Moshe
Yaalon, who also acknowledged Arafat's intention to curb
violence.
</P>
<P>
The professional assessment apparently dismissed the repeated
charges made by some politicians within the Likud government
against Arafat for supporting and organizing violence. So it also
received mixed reactions from committee members from the ruling
coalition and the opposition, who traded accusations over the
current situation.
</P>
<P>
Hardline members of the committee, including Likud lawmaker
Benny Begin and committee chairman Uzi Landau, voiced their
reservations about this report.
</P>
<P>
Likud lawmaker Gedon Yisrael, who was a former GSS deputy
head, dismissed the opposition charges that the current
situation in the territories could trigger a new intifada, or
Palestinian uprising.
</P>
<P>
He blasted the opposition for trying to frighten the
Israeli people with such warnings.
</P>
<P>
But Moshe Shahal, Labor's former Public Security Minister,
expressed great concern about the possibility of an explosion
in the territories as result of the continued stalemate in
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"As much as I can say, the situation is on the verge of the
possibility of an explosion, or to be set on fire," Shahal
warned, adding that the Likud government has to take actions to
break the current peace stalemate so to head off the explosion.

LUANDA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Angola's former rebel movement the
UNITA has informed the UN Observation Mission on the number of
the private guards of UNITA president Jonas Savimbi and his
police in the diamond mining area in the northeast.
</P>
<P>
This was announced here today by Isaias Samakuva,
representative of the National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola (UNITA) in the Joint Commission for Angola's Peace
Process during the interview with the correspondent of the
"Peace" programme of the UN Observation Mission.
</P>
<P>
This was the result of the consultation held recently
between UNITA leader and UN special envoy in Angola Blondin
Beye, he said, without revealing the specific figures.
</P>
<P>
The private guards and the diamond area police are all UNITA
troops. But so far they have not entered the concentration areas
and have not handed out their weapons. According to peace
agreement, these armymen should also be disarmed and dissolved.
Solution of this problem will facilitate the development of the
peace process.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Delegate Puts Forward Suggestions for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Alternate Representative of the
Chinese delegation Mr Liu Xinsheng today put forward three
suggestions for the reform of the United Nations Commission on
Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
Liu was speaking at the 1997 substantive session of the
Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) on the issue of human rights.
His suggestions are as follows:
</P>
<P>
- Setting straight the ideas guiding the activities of the
Commission on Human Rights. The Universal Declaration of Human
Rights and the Vienna Declaration and Program of Action have
clearly provided for the ideas guiding international activities in
the field of human rights i.e. conducting international
cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual cooperation. The
essence to reform for the Human Rights Commission is the
reaffirmation of the ideas guiding its activities. If these basic
ideas of cooperation based on equality in international activities
on human rights are not adhered to, the commission will find it
difficult to fulfil the mandate conferred on it by the UN Charter,
no matter what type of organization or modality it adopts for
itself.
</P>
<P>
- Put a quick end to political confrontations in the Commission
on Human Rights. Confrontation and cooperation cannot coexist, so
the removal of the confrontation between countries should be the
No 1 task in reforms. In this regard, the 53rd session of the
commission took a welcoming step. Under the initiative of the
developing consultation, dialogue and the spirit of consensus.
With this as the premise, reform for the commission should
seriously reconsider the direction followed in the consideration
of the item of country situations, so that it will promote
cooperation between countries instead of aggravating confrontation
between them.
</P>
<P>
- The interests and demand of the developing countries must be
fully taken into consideration. The developing countries are the
mainstay of the international community. In formulating reform
programs, consideration should be given not just to the on-going
activities in the field of human rights, but also to the future
needs of the developing countries. The reform programs should be
forward-looking and serve to promote the economic and social
development of the developing countries. Specific programs of
reform should be decided upon on the basis of full and democratic
consultation. In particular, they must reflect the views and
concern of the developing countries, increase the proportional
weight given to the right to development, economic, social and
cultural rights, change the existing imbalance in the membership
of the commission and in the geographical distribution of
personnel in the Center for Human Rights.

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani: Iran Is Committed to NPT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani said here today that Iran is committed to the human and
Islamic principles and is not after the nuclear arms at all.
</P>
<P>
The 64-year-old president declared that his country decisively
supports the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and elimination of the
ominous phenomenon of the nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani made the remark in a meeting with Hans Blix,
Director of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
</P>
<P>
He said "Iranian nuclear programs are crystal clear and
transparent and for humanitarian purposes. We always welcome
sharing experience with respective international agencies."
</P>
<P>
Blix appreciated the current cooperation between Iran and the
IAEA, saying Iran allows the agency to inspect any nuclear center
in Iran at any time.
</P>
<P>
He said the various inspections of Iranian nuclear installation
conducted by the IAEA indicated that Iranian nuclear capability
is for humanitarian and peaceful purposes.
</P>
<P>
Blix turned down the doubts by certain countries over Iran's
purpose of developing the nuclear industry, saying the question is
biased for political ends.
</P>
<P>
"It is the natural right of any nation to acquire nuclear
technology for the production of electricity, the manufacture of
medicine, its application in the humanitarian areas and the
protection of the environment," he was quoted by the official news
agency IRNA as saying.
</P>
<P>
Blix, who arrived in Tehran on Saturday, inspected a nuclear
research facility in Bonab, in northwestern province of Eastern
Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
He said "the activities of Bonab nuclear research facilities
is completely directed toward peaceful purposes and toward the
economic development of Iran."
</P>
<P>
Iran's nuclear industry is under constant scrutiny of the
United States and Israel, which Tehran regards as two main
rivals. Both Washington and Tel Aviv maintain that Iran is seeking
to use nuclear technology for military purposes.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Israel have even threatened to stage a preemptive
air raid against the nuclear power plant in the southern port
city of Bushehr, alleging that Iran plans to build an atomic
bomb.
</P>
<P>
Iran is finishing the power plant with help from Russia.
Moscow has been under pressure from Washington and Tel Aviv
to stop helping Iran finish the nuclear power plant which will
be the first nuclear power plant in the Persian Gulf.

<HEADLINE> Somali Celebrates Its Traditional New Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 22 (Xinhua)-- As the biggest traditional
festival of Istunka unrolled its second day in Somali's Afgoe
district today, thousands of people gathered from the three
regions surrounding Afgoe, 30 km south of the capital.
</P>
<P>
The traditional festival, marking the beginning of the
traditional year of Somalia, is held at the western river bank of
the town where two contending groups meet and the spectators
gather to witness the major event.
</P>
<P>
According to Sheikh Ahmed Sultan Sheikh Abdi, sultan of the
town, the Istunka festival is as old as 702 years and is
practised every year by people in the region.
</P>
<P>
Istunka is played by two groups of dozens of male youngsters
with sticks who beat each other until one of the two flees the
playing ground, which is about the size of a football field.
</P>
<P>
The groups are formed after residential directions, east and
west of the river.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the security provisions offered by the
faction of Hussein Mohamed Aidid, the two groups were allowed to
use light sticks to minimize the damage. A number of militiamen
armed with assault rifles and battle wagons surrounded the green
field.
</P>
<P>
As one of the groups was chased away Monday, the security
guards reacted by firing warning shots so as to stop those of the
upper hand from further hurting some of the already bleeding and
defeated players.
</P>
<P>
The town of Afgoe was blessed with special weather Monday.
Commercial activities have drawn in business people from all
around the region. The spectators including foreigners and the
Somali elites have been buying grapefruit and coconut as they
watch the Istunka game.
</P>
<P>
According to the tradition, young ladies do not marry the
defeated young men for at least the next season.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Abdi Tarafiko, a former policeman, said this tradition
is believed to be leading the people to more prosperous season
and that the bloodletting is different as it will not bring about
clan retaliation activities.
</P>
<P>
Some of the militant traditionalists believe that the practice
will prevent droughts and other natural disasters. No rain will
come if the practice of Istunka is stopped.
</P>
<P>
Several other traditional activities are being performed in
the regions of lower and middle Shabelle and Benadir region. The
most common one is the bonfire where the people gather sticks and
hay and set them on fire.
</P>
<P>
Young boys and girls jump over the fire which indicates
they're jumping over all the difficulties in the year to come.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the festival, the two groups embrace each other
with love after their committee of elders tell them to stop the
game, whereas earlier, the late regime used water canoes to stop
the fighting when the time ran out.
</P>
<P>
The Somali traditional year which begins tomorrow is called
Wednesday (the year takes its name after the day it begins).

<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar Bashir
today called upon Arab countries to give up completely their
differences, to join ranks and to eliminate the causes of
conflicts and tension.
</P>
<P>
Bashir issued the call in a meeting here with foreign
correspondents in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
He said that Arab dispersion and division have provided the
Jews with the greatest gains at present. The Palestinian rights
today are being deprived of, he said, warning that the whole of
Palestine would be lost.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese head of state said that developments in Palestine
were the outcome of the state of weakness of the Arab nation,
adding that Israel was undergoing a Judaization process.
</P>
<P>
By minimizing Arab presence and intensifying Jewish existence,
Israel is creating a new demographic and geographic status so that
Jerusalem may become a totally-Israeli city, he said.
</P>
<P>
Bashir stressed that Sudan supports any Arab effort that
upholds Palestinian and Arab rights.

<HEADLINE> Taylor Still Ahead in Liberian Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Liberia's former warlord Charles
Taylor today still leads far ahead of other presidential
contestants in Saturday's election, with 65 percent of the votes
in hand.
</P>
<P>
The latest summary sheet of the poll counting faxed here from
the Independent Elections Commission (IECOM) shows that Charles
Taylor, the National Patriotic Party flag bearer has won 170,989
of the 261,533 votes counted so far, accounting for 65.379
percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
His closest rival, Unity Party's woman candidate Ellen
Johnson-Sirleaf, lags far behind him with only 41,318 votes, or
13.798 percent, ranking second.
</P>
<P>
The votes announced by IECOM are collected from 812 of the
1,860 polling stations, where ballot boxes and tally sheets have
been transported to IECOM's regional headquarters and then to the
national headquarters in the capital Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 percent of the 710,000-strong registered voters
are estimated to take part in Saturday's election, the first in
12 years and the last stage of a peace accord signed last August
to end the devastating civil war Taylor ignited in December 1989.
</P>
<P>
Counting of the ballots, contained in transparent boxes
reportedly supplied by Ghana, started shortly after the election
ended at 4 p.m. (local time) Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The work has been proceeding under the protection of the West
African Peacekeeping Force (ECOMOG) and in the presence of
international and local observers.
</P>
<P>
When Liberians went to the last poll in 1985, results were not
released for two weeks and were widely considered to have been
rigged to favor the then incumbent dictator Samuel Doe.
</P>
<P>
Taylor's rebellion against Doe, who was tortured to death in
1990, triggered off Liberia's civil war.
</P>
<P>
The 500 international observers, including former U.S.
president Jimmy Carter, declared Monday the poll to be free, fair
and peaceful, with "a few but not significant problems".
</P>
<P>
Despite Johnson-Sirleaf's allegations that ECOMOG interfered
in the polls by providing assistance to voters, a spokesman for
her party promised cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone will cooperate. I think Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf will
accept the decision of IECOM," said Kona Khasu at the party
headquarters, quoted by a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
As for ECOMOG's aid, he said: "People should look at the very
high level of illiteracy in Liberia. Out of 10 persons that came
to vote may be only two can do it without help, the others will
ask for the process to be explained to them."
</P>

Although final results are yet to come until Wednesday,
observers believe that Taylor's overwhelming 65 percent share of
results released so far has actually meant his winning of the
election, making a run-off unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
Taylor's mandate is likely to give his party considerable
control over the U.S.-style bicameral legislature, whose 90 seats
will be allocated by proportional representation in accordance
with Saturday's ballots cast.

<HEADLINE> Jordanians Protest Against Sentence on Soldier for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of residents in Irbid, some
60 kilometers north of here, today clashed with the police during
their demonstration against the court sentence against a soldier
who killed seven Israeli girls in March.
</P>
<P>
Several demonstrators were injured and a few others arrested,
said reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The protesters demanded that 28-year-old Ahamd Mousa Dakamseh,
who was sentenced to life imprisonment by a military court
Saturday, be released immediately, calling him a "national hero."
</P>
<P>
Amid the demonstration that happened in the soldier`s
hometown, the protesters fought the police with stones and sticks,
while the police used military cudgels and tear gas to disperse
them.
</P>
<P>
In April when the trial started, Dakamseh was accused of
pre-meditated murder and faced death penalty for he shot and
killed seven Israeli school girls and four others including a
teacher at Baqoura in northern Jordan Valley in March.
</P>
<P>
After the three months' trial, the court ruled last Saturday
that he was guilty of murder and sentenced him to life
imprisonment with hard labor. The court said he was considered
mentally unstable.
</P>
<P>
Some Jordanian organizations and political parties said the
sentence was too heavy for him. They also contributed much money
to the soldier's family, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
On March 13, when Dakamseh was doing prayer on his duty, some
Israeli girls on a tourist bus saw him and laughed at him. The
soldier then became angry, grabbed a gun from one of his
colleagues and shot to the Israeli children.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed peace treaty with Israel in 1994 and became the
second Arab country after Egypt to reach such an agreement with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Anti-Israel sentiment has been rampant in the kingdom as the
Israeli government's hardline policy blocked the Middle East peace
process.

<HEADLINE> Siemens to Use Java Technology to Produce New Smart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Germany's electronic company Siemens
announced today that it will use the Java technology licensed by
the U.S company Sun Microelectronics to produce a new generation
of semiconductor chips that would greatly expand the use of smart
cards.
</P>
<P>
The new chips, which Siemens hopes to bring to market by
mid-1998, are expected to enable one single smart card to be used
for multiple purposes, including banking, electronic commerce,
mobile communications, healthcare, and even access to the
Internet, Siemens said.
</P>
<P>
Smart cards are rapidly replacing cashes for many applications
throughout Europe, including pay phones and vending machines.
Among many applications possible, smart cards are also being used
to automate airline ticketing, record and update healthcare
procedures, and improve telephone security.
</P>
<P>
According to industry analysts, the smart card is currently
undergoing a transition from a simple, single-purpose device to a
complex, multi-application platform that is an integral part of
computer and telecommunications networks.
</P>
<P>
Combined with the Java technology, Siemens' next generation of
smart card chips will expand their market position with increased
memory capacity and enhanced performance on chip security, said
Chet Silvestri, president of Sun Microelectronics.

<HEADLINE> Levy, Arafat Meet to Re-Launch Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Yasser Arafat and Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy said here today that common efforts would be
made to "remove obstacles" in the way of re-launching the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
They made the remark at a joint press conference held in
Brussels Tuesday with Jacques Poos, the rotating president of the
European Council of Foreign Ministers and foreign minister of
Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
Through the EU's mediation, Arafat and Levy had a meeting
Tuesday afternoon in Brussels to resume the bilateral talks on the
peace process which broke down in March.
</P>
<P>
Both Arafat and Levy expressed their satisfaction with the
meeting, saying that they must re-launch the stalled peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat believed that the two sides must restore "confidence in
each other" in their way to resuming the peace process, adding
that they must overcome "great challenges and difficulties" to
savage the process.
</P>
<P>
Levy said that the Israeli government had decided to re-launch
the peace process and that both sides should "do everything they
can" to send a message of "courage, security, cooperation and
hope" to people of both sides.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the European Union (EU), Poos held out hope that
Israel and the Palestinian Autonomy could resume their peace talks
to solve all kinds of bilateral issues, including political ones,
to give the region a "lasting peace."
</P>
<P>
The building of around 6,500 settlements by Israel in March led
to severe violence between the two sides, which as a result
thwarted the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Protest Against Turkish Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government will make
representations to the United Nations and other international
organizations over a joint declaration issued by Turkey and the
Turkish Cypriots, which threatened partial integration of
northern Cyprus into Turkey.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by government spokesman Manolis Christofides
at his daily press briefing here today.
</P>
<P>
He said the Cypriot government is considering all means at its
disposal to tackle this issue.
</P>
<P>
"We need to examine and assess the outcome and the
repercussion of every move which will be taken," he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted the joint declaration "needs to be
examined because it is very serious and unacceptable and goes
beyond all bounds of legality."
</P>
<P>
The joint declaration was signed Sunday by Turkish Deputy
Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash on the occasion of 23rd anniversary of Turkish invasion
in 1974.
</P>
<P>
The declaration outlines a proposed series of steps toward
partial integration in the economic and financial fields, and
promotes a partnership in security, defense and the foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
Christofides said the declaration contradicts all the
principles governing relations between U.N. member states and the
1960 treaties on which the Cyprus Republic was established.
</P>
<P>
He did not rule out the possibility of a recourse to the
U.N. Security Council, noting this is one of the means in our
disposal, whose importance and consequences will be analyzed in
all details at the meeting of the National Council, the top
advisory body to the Cypriot president on the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that "developments will be examined
together with the Greek government."
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides will
raise this issue at Thursday's meeting of the National Council and
put forward a proposal on the matter.
</P>
<P>
The joint declaration was issued following the European
Commission's affirmation last week that accession negotiations
of Cyprus with the European Union (EU) will start early next
year.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot side have objected to Cyprus'
accession into the EU before Turkey becomes a full EU member.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and took over the northern third of the island in the
wake of a failed coup backed by military junta ruling Greece at
the time.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot side declared unilaterally a breakaway
state "the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" in 1983, which
was only recognized by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Russia Quarrel with Belarus, Ukraine over Gas Deliveries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Russian natural gas giant
Gazprom corporation has cut shipments to Belarus by 25 percent in
order to force the country to repay more than 100 million U.S.
dollars for gas deliveries, according to a report reaching here
from Minsk, Capital of Belarus.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency quoted Nikolai Mochernyuk, the head of
Beltransgaz transporting company, as saying on Tuesday that
Belarus owes the Russian corporation Gazprom 123 million U.S.
dollars, that Russia's claims that the Belarussian debt has grown
to 221 million U.S. dollars "are not quite true".
</P>
<P>
Mochernyuk said that debt accumulated at the end of last year,
but at the beginning of 1997 the Belarussian government managed to
collect some 100 million U.S. dollars to repay it. At the moment
the debt is decreasing because current payments amount to some 120
percent of current deliveries, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The correctness of calculations made by Belarussian experts has
been confirmed by staff members of the accounting section of
Gazprom.
</P>
<P>
He said the differences "could result from inaccurate
operational data."
</P>
<P>
The gas corporation last week notified Belarus of cutting gas
supplies in half starting Saturday unless the debt was repaid.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that a Belarussian government delegation led by
Deputy Prime Minister Valery Kokorev left for Moscow Tuesday to
resolve the problem.
</P>
<P>
Another report from Zmeyovka, central Russia, said that the
Russian gas giant Gazprom also cut daily gas deliveries to Ukraine
by 20 million cubic meters on July 22.
</P>
<P>
According to Gazprom chief Rem Vyakhirev, by the end of Tuesday
daily cuts may reach 40 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
The cut was prompted by the growing indebtedness of the
Ukrainian side. The two biggest Ukrainian gas traders -- the
Ukrainian Unified Energy System and Intergaz -- owe Gazprom
100-150 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The chief stressed that he would sort out the problem tomorrow
with Ukrainian President Leomid Kuchma and his new Prime Minister
Valery Pustovoitenko.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriot Leader Warns Against Cyprus-EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash today threatened to postpone the bi-communal direct
negotiations on the Cyprus problem if the European Union (EU) goes
ahead with its accession talks with Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission reaffirmed last week its decision to
commence accession negotiations with Cyprus early next year.
</P>
<P>
"The EU has to postpone Cyprus' application while the
intercommunal talks are proceeding. If they want the
intercommunal talks to proceed, they should postpone dealing with
the Cyprus application," Denktash said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark prior to a meeting today with the
U.N. Secretary-General's Resident Representative Gustave Feissel
in Turkish-controlled northern part of Nicosia, according to the
Cyprus News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He stopped short, however, of saying he would scuttle the
second round of his U.N.-brokered direct talks with Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides, scheduled for August 11 to 16 in
Switzerland. He deferred that decision to his "government," said
the report.
</P>
<P>
Another option, Denktash said, is "to postpone the direct
talks until we see whether the EU will take notice of our
existence."
</P>
<P>
The first round of direct talks between leaders of the Greek
and Turkish Cypriot communities took place at Troutbeck near New
York on July 9-12. During the talks, the two leaders decided to
have a meeting in Nicosia, under the U.N. auspices, to discuss
humanitarian issues.
</P>
<P>
Denktash said that his meeting with Feissel was to exchange
views "because I still think that I should meet with Clerides for
other matters and see whether we can agree on certain issues."
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus issue has remained unresolved since 1974 when
the island was divided after Turkish troops invaded and took
over the northern third in the wake of a failed Greek
Cypriot coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot side declared unilaterally a breakaway
state "the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" in 1983, which is
only recognized by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Completes Reform Package on Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish Education Ministry has
completed an eight-year compulsory education reform package, a
senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference, Education Minister Hikmet
Ulugbay said that the bill prepared by his ministry would be
submitted to the parliament this week.
</P>
<P>
Ulugbay reaffirmed that under the reform package the current
five-year elementary education would be extended to eight years,
adding that it would be "uninterrupted."
</P>
<P>
The government led by Mesut Yilmaz, which won a vote of
confidence on July 12, was believed to carry out intentionally the
uninterrupted educational reform in an effort to curb the rapidly
increasing fundamentalist force.
</P>
<P>
Ulugbay said that the secondary schools would be under
the name of "elementary educational institutions."
</P>
<P>
This new package on the educational reform has sparked the
nationwide reaction since the closure of the second segments of
high schools, which also includes the abolishment of religious
schools.
</P>
<P>
Turkish military and secularists have repeatedly complained
about the rapid growth of the numbers of religious schools.
</P>
<P>
Former prime minister Necmettin Erbakan, who has been
criticized for his pro-Islamic ideas, warned that the ruling
Motherland Party would bear the responsibility for the
consequences of the new educational model.
</P>
<P>
The high schools will be prohibited from admitting new
students as of next year, the education minister added.

<HEADLINE> Italy Voices Its Support for Turkey's EU Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano
Prodi stated that his government will continue its support for
Turkey's full EU membership drive, according to a statement
issued here today by the Turkish prime minister's office.
</P>
<P>
Prodi, in a letter to Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz,
said that the EU should fulfill its obligations to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Italian prime minister's promise came as a response to a
call made by Yilmaz for EU leaders' support of Turkey's membership
application.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz's call followed a recent recommendation report by the
European Commission which excluded Turkey from the ranks of
prospective candidates.
</P>
<P>
Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis also made a reply to
Yilmaz's call, urging Turkey to improve its economy and human
rights record.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission report was termed as a heavy blow to
Turkey as it embraced Cyprus -- a country enjoying close ties with
Turkey's traditional rival of Greece -- to the future EU
membership talks.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has long strived for full EU membership in a bid
to give a strong push to its economy, but failed to achieve
such a goal due to some controversial issues with the European
body, including human rights, Cyprus issue as well as its
unstable economy.

KAMPALA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Vice-President Specioza

by bettering the condition for education.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan vice-president made the remarks while meeting the
visiting South African women parliamentarians here.
</P>

She said the success achieved by women in Uganda, though

<HEADLINE> Clinton Supports Equalizing Crack Cocaine, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Tuesday voiced his support to a recommendation to narrow the
100-fold disparity between crack and powder cocaine sentences and
urged Congress to reach "an acceptable resolution."
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Janet Reno and retired General Barry
McCaffrey, the president's drug policy adviser, proposed that
those selling 25 grams of crack and 250 grams of powdered cocaine
receive the same mandatory five-year prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
Clinton expressed his support to the idea before meeting with
his budget advisers at the White House.
</P>
<P>
"I have accepted it, and I have urged them now to go to work
immediately with the Congress to try to reach an acceptable
resolution of this," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Under current law, selling five grams of crack draws a
five-year sentence. A dealer of powdered cocaine would have to
sell 500 grams to receive the same amount of prison time.
</P>
<P>
Critics described the disparity as unfair to minorities who
possess crack, which they say is cheaper but no worse than powder.
Others say crack is far more addictive than powder cocaine and
causes much more violence among dealers.
</P>
<P>
Reno's recommendation, made in a July 3 letter to Clinton,
reflected the sentiments of an April 29 report by the U.S.
Sentencing Commission, which proposed narrowing the disparity
while leaving high penalties for crack possession in place.
</P>
<P>
"Those who sell crack ought to be punished more," Reno told
black police executives in Miami on Monday. But she said the
disparity was far too extreme, and was perceived as unfair in the
black community.
</P>
<P>
The proposed change must be approved by Congress, where it will
possibly run into some opposition. But the recommendation enjoys
support among many federal judges and prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the sentencing commission recommended equalizing the
penalties for possession and sale of the two varieties, partly
because of complaints of racial bias. More than 90 percent of
defendants in the more heavily penalized crack cases are black,
compared with only 25 percent of powder defendants.
</P>
<P>
The issue has been before the courts. A federal appeals court
had rejected the racial-bias argument, and the Supreme Court
declined without comment to overturn the ruling.

<HEADLINE> CBI Says Yes to EMU, When Conditions Are Right </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Confederation of British
Industry (CBI) believes that the UK's economic and business
interest is best served by membership of EMU, when the conditions
are right.
</P>
<P>
The UK Government should now work to help bring about the
conditions which will make EMU a success, CBI said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting of the CBI National Council here,
Niall FitzGerald, Chairman of the CBI's Europe Committee, said
today: "The CBI believes that a successful EMU would be a logical
extension of the Single Market and therefore a good thing for
British business and that we should be actively involved as a
nation in bringing it about."
</P>
<P>
"The UK Government should declare strong support for UK
membership of a successful EMU, work constructively with our EU
partners to bring about the conditions for a sustainable single
currency, and join when they are in place," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Chairman pointed out that "A successful EMU would bring
many benefits, but success depends upon fiscal convergence and on
labor markets becoming more, not less, flexible."
</P>
<P>
"As for the UK, it is unlikely that our position in the
economic cycle will make entry on 1st January 1999 appropriate -
even if the others go ahead," he expected.
</P>
<P>
Colin Marshall, President of the CBI, added: " After four
months of intensive consultation, it is important now for the CBI
to come off the fence and state clearly which course of action is
in the best interests of British business."
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the most important economic decisions this
country has had to face in my lifetime - and the business voice
must be heard," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The CBI believes that the key benefits of a successful EMU to
UK business are:
</P>
<P>
- The completion of the EU Single Market, with open competition
and transparent pricing
</P>
<P>
- The elimination of exchange rate risk from EU trade and
investment
</P>
<P>
- Removal of the damaging effects of exchange rate overshoots
</P>
<P>
- The creation of an effective single European capital market
for equity and debt
</P>
<P>
- A reinforcement of the maintenance of low inflation and
interest rates in the UK.
</P>
<P>
But EMU does carry significant risks. These will be reduced if
EMU proceeds on the basis of:
</P>
<P>
- Public finances which are sustainable in the long-term
</P>
<P>
- A European Central Bank clearly committed to price stability
as its primary objective
</P>
<P>
- Evolution of labor market policies towards greater
flexibility, rather than greater restriction.

<HEADLINE> Shilling's Fall Sparks Fear of Price Increase in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan Shilling's decline
against the major hard currencies sparked fear of price hike,
especially a price rise in fuel and crude oil, a local report
said today.
</P>
<P>
Local oil companies claimed that they are monitoring the
shilling's fluctuation and crude oil price movement to see
whether to raise fuel prices on the liberalized market next
month, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The sudden depreciation of the shilling from around 54 against
one U.S. Dollar two weeks ago to currently 59, has sparked fears
that a rise in fuel prices would be effected by the oil companies
although the shilling has recouped some of its losses.
</P>
<P>
Importers complained last week that they already had to pay
more shillings to buy the Dollar.
</P>
<P>
Industries that depend on imported raw materials are expected
to pay more too.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the manufacturing sector said industries might soon
be forced to review upwards their prices if the shilling
continues to depreciate.
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers said last week that the money market was
still fluid and a repeat of the July 7 violence could devastate
effect on the already weak currency.
</P>
<P>
It was also feared that another rise in fuel prices after the
budget increase would make it more difficult for the government
to achieve the objective of keeping inflation at single digit.
</P>
<P>
However, the chief economist at the Central Bank of Kenya
(CBK), Maurice Kanga, dismissed the fears and said there was no
evidence of a sustained upward trend of the country's currency.
</P>
<P>
He said the underlaying inflation rate is currently well below
10 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to CBK statistics, the overall month-on-month
inflation rate also dropped from 17.2 percent in May to 12.8
percent in June.

<P>
BRUSSELS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- A total of 18 million people in
the European Union (EU) countries, almost half of them women, had
no job but were available and looking for work in 1996.
</P>
<P>
This was an EU unemployment rate of 49.4 percent in the survey
week in spring last year, according to a report out today by
Eurostat, the EU's statistical office.
</P>
<P>
The report found a total of 149.3 million people in the EU with

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Cultivates "Super Cassava" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The International Institute of Tropical
Agriculture (IITA) based in western Nigeria has announced a
breakthrough in its cassava research with yield tripling the current
varieties.
</P>
<P>
The "super cassava" variety is expected produce 40 tons per
hectare, an IITA statement said today.
</P>
<P>
Cassava is one of the most common food in Nigeria and is also raw
material for industrial use.
</P>
<P>
IITA was established 30 years ago as an organ under the umbrella of
the United Nations consultative group on international agricultural
research.
</P>
<P>
The institute also focuses its research on other crops such as
yam, cowpea, soybean and maize, in addition to its continuous
research into crop management and resource.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government, which has attached great importance to the
institute, enacted a decree on July 24, 1967 and then signed it into
law for its establishment.
</P>
<P>
IITA, which covers an area of 1,000 hectare in Ibadan, Oyo State,
also has two stations each in the east and north of the country.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Says US Fed on Alert Against Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed)
Chairman Alan Greenspan said today that the Fed stands ready to
boost interest rates at the first sign of inflation.
</P>
<P>
In the midyear report to the U.S. Congress, Greenspan said that
inflation has remained restrained even though U.S. unemployment
this year has fallen near a 25-year low and the economic expansion
is now the third longest in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that the good news on inflation is not likely to
last forever and said that the U.S. central bank has to be ready
to move pre-emptively to make sure inflationary pressures do not
get out of hand.
</P>
<P>
"With considerable momentum behind the expansion and labor
market utilization rates unusually high, the Federal Reserve must
be alert to the possibility that additional action might be called
for to forestall excessive credit creation," Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the U.S. economy slowed in the spring but he said
it is still unclear whether the slower, more sustainable pace is
temporary.
</P>
<P>
Because of all the uncertainty, Greenspan said the Fed has to
rely on forecasts of what the economy might do and "needs
constantly to look down the road to gauge the future risks to the
economy and act accordingly."
</P>
<P>
Greenspan's comments were in line with expectations of many
economists that the U.S. Fed, which has already raised interest
rates once this year in March, is poised to do so again in the
second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
While warning against the threat of future inflation, Greenspan
agreed that so far inflation pressures have not become evident.
</P>
<P>
The Fed's revised economic forecast actually lowered its
inflation estimate for this year, putting the mid-range estimate
for price increases at 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent compared with a
February forecast of 2.75 percent to 3 percent. It predicted that
U.S. inflation will increase to 2.5 percent to 3 percent next
year.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Opposition Leaders to Take United Actions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan main opposition leaders
today agreed that they should negotiate with the government in
unity on the issue of the constitutional reforms.
</P>
<P>
However, it seems the opposition still fails to pick a team to
discuss the reforms with the government led by President Daniel
arap Moi, 73 and in power for 19 years.
</P>
<P>
"Mass action will continue until the government commits itself
to bona fide dialogue," 105 representatives of various opposition
parties and pro-reform groups vowed in a resolution after an hour
long meeting.
</P>
<P>
The document will be presented to the Presidential Office
Wednesday, Kivutha Kibwana, chief of the National Convention
Executive Council (NCEC), told reporters after reading the
resolution on behalf of the representatives.
</P>
<P>
"The dialogue will be undertaken through the NCEC" and within
the institutional framework the NCEC provides, said the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
NCEC is the umbrella body of National Convention Assembly set
up in Limuru in April to coordinate the opposition's campaign for
constitutional reforms.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also demanded the government stop steps like
drafting bills on constitutional and legal reforms "since it can
only be developed after the dialogue is concluded,"
</P>
<P>
The government is expected to present bills in less than two
weeks to the current session of the parliament for enactment of a
commission to review the constitution and make proposals for the
repeal or amendment of laws charged as oppressive.
</P>
<P>
These laws include the Public Order Act on public rallies, the
Preservation of Public Security Act which allows detention
without trial, as well as other nine laws.
</P>
<P>
In another apparent softening of his originally hard stance,
Moi also met with official opposition leader Kijana Wamalwa and
19 key religious leaders last week and pledged to hold the first
round of dialogue on the reforms with the opposition this week.
</P>
<P>
The government's shifts came days after the most violent
conflicts between the police and the opposition supporters in
seven years broke out and claimed 13 lives around the eastern
African country on July 7.

<HEADLINE> Brittan Welcomes CBI Support for UK Entry Into EMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Sir Leon Brittan, vice-president
of the European Commission, today welcomed the decision of the
Confederation of British Industry (CBI) to support in principle
British participation in the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
"The potential benefits of EMU for British business -- and for
British people generally -- are considerable," the vice-president
of the EU's executive body said today.
</P>
<P>
He said the EMU meant completion of a "genuine, competitive"
single market, elimination of exchange rate uncertainties, and low
inflation and interest rates in the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The results of a Gallup poll Monday showed that most British
people were prepared to consider the case for EMU on its merits.
</P>
<P>
The CBI also said recently that it was important that the
conditions for a "successful and sustainable" single currency were
in place.
</P>
<P>
Brittan said that the UK had an important role in encouraging
the process towards convergence. He added that he welcomed the
British Chancellor of the Exchequer's statement last week that the
government intended to play a "central and constructive" part in
the debate.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that British companies and financial
institutions would now step up their preparations to ensure that
they were ready for the UK's participation.
</P>
<P>
"Whenever that happens, a substantial amount of preparation
will be needed first, and the time has come for that preparation
to be taken very seriously indeed," Brittan finally said.

<HEADLINE> US Deficit Expected to Hit Lowest Point Since 1970s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The healthy U.S. economy has
slashed the government deficit for the first nine months of fiscal
1997 to 10.9 billion dollars, setting the stage for the smallest
shortfall since the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
The government finished June with a monthly surplus of 54.6
billion dollars, higher than analysts had predicted following a
record 93.9 billion dollar surplus in April.
</P>
<P>
For June alone, the U.S. government took in 173.4 billion
dollars, up 14.1 percent from last year. Quarterly taxes paid by
businesses and investors were due, and a booming economy and stock
market are credited for the greater-than-expected receipts.
</P>
<P>
June spending was 118.8 billion dollars, 1 percent higher than
last year.
</P>
<P>
So far in fiscal 1997, which began on October 1 of last year,
individual income taxes have brought the government 13.8 percent
more, and corporate taxes 8 percent more, than in the first three
quarters of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Government spending, however, is only 3.2 percent higher than
last year.
</P>
<P>
Since October 1, the U.S. government has collected 1.2 trillion
dollars in revenue, up from 1.1 trillion at this time a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Year-to-date spending through June was also about 1.2 trillion
dollars compared with 1.17 trillion last year.
</P>
<P>
U.S. budget analysts said earlier this month that summertime
projections, expected soon from U.S. government and Congressional
forecasters, could pull the U.S. government deficit below 50
billion dollars for the full year. That would be its lowest since
1979, when it was 40.7 billion.

BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- China has joined an international
convention on stolen or illegally-exported relics, Ma Zishu, deputy

</P>
<P>
According to the terms of the convention, member countries are
entitled to reclaim relics which have been stolen from them after
a certain period of time.
</P>
<P>
The terms, however, do not cover ancient fabrics, rare books
and Buddhist sutras which were seized by foreign forces from the
Mogao Grottoes at Dunhuang, in northwest China's Gansu
Province. This was the largest batch of relics China has lost.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 countries have joined the convention, which was
set up in June 1995 in Rome.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 4.5 billion US dollars-worth of relics is
stolen in China every year. In the first five months of this year
alone, the Chinese customs tracked down more than 7,500 stolen
relics.
</P>
<P>
"The trouble is that many museums do not have files

diabetes and the rate is expected to rise in the following years,
according to the study released by UAE's medical center today.
</P>
<P>
The study, involving 2,000 UAE nationals aged between 30 and 80
years, found diabetes in the UAE to be particularly widespread
among the elderly and less educated social groups.
</P>
<P>
The study attributed the reason to the increasing incidence of
obesity among UAE nationals, which is strongly linked to diabetes.
</P>
<P>
Doctors said common sense should be applied and they suggested
nationals to eat more fruits, cereals and vegetables which were
cited as the best sources to avoid diabetes.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has a 2.4 million population, but about two third of
them are foreigners.

<P>
STOCKHOLM, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Swedish police have broken a
Russian money laundering gang operating in Stockholm, Sweden,
media reports said here today.
</P>
<P>
More than 8 million Swedish kronor (about 1 million
U.S. dollars) designated by Russian government for renovation of
hospitals in Murmansk have been spent on luxury items by private
individuals in Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that one of the suspects, a 37-year-old Russian,
has been arrested and is awaiting extradition to Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish and Russian police have cooperated in the
"Operation Murmansk" to apprehend the swindlers and are expected
to bust further money laundering operations.
</P>
<P>
The police are investigating how the swindlers knew in advance
about the Russian funds designated for hospital renovation
equipment.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: ASEAN to Become Stronger After Admitting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PETALING JAYA, Malaysia, July 23 (Xinhua) -- With the raising
of their national flags today in front of the Sunway Lagoon Resort
Hotel, the venue of the 30th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (AMM), Laos
and Myanmar officially joined the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
The admission of the two countries has brought the number of
ASEAN members from seven to nine and was a milestone in the
regional grouping's history.
</P>
<P>
It also represents a giant step toward realizing the ASEAN's
goal of including all the nations in Southeast Asia in its
membership.
</P>
<P>
But what is more important is that the expansion, which comes
at a time when the organization celebrates its 30th founding
anniversary, will enable ASEAN to contribute more effectively to
peace and security and economic prosperity in the region through
the members' cooperation in the political, security and economic
fields.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of all the ASEAN members expressed their
happiness at the two countries' membership and they hope that the
entry will help strengthen ASEAN and thus increase its capability
to promote regional and global peace and security.
</P>
<P>
The accession of Laos and Myanmar conforms to ASEAN's
objectives, goals, principles and aspirations for building a
peaceful and prosperous Southeast Asian community.
</P>
<P>
In the past 10 years or more, ASEAN has been striving for a
bigger role in regional and international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Besides trying to engage Laos and Myanmar and Cambodia whose
admission had been decided and then deferred because of the
factional fighting in that country, it has entered into a
relationship of dialogue partners with nine countries including
China, Russia and the United States, and the European Union and
formed a loose relationship of cooperation partner with the U.N.
Development Program.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the First Asia-Europe Meeting was held in Bangkok,
Thailand, at the initiative of ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN's ever greater political role has made it a major factor
for the unprecedented peace and stability Southeast Asia enjoys
today.
</P>
<P>
By bringing countries of different political and social systems
in the region into the fold, Southeast Asia will surely become
politically more stable and ASEAN will also assume a greater role
in the world, political observers said.
</P>
<P>
Economic considerations also figured prominently in ASEAN's
decision to admit Laos and Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time that ASEAN has accepted new members
after Brunei joined the organization in 1984 and Vietnam in 1995.
</P>
<P>
With the admission of Laos and Myanmar, ASEAN now covers a land
area of some 4.3 million square kilometers with a total population
of more than 480 million. With the two countries' entry also come
abundant natural resources and a huge market for ASEAN goods.
</P>
<P>
As pointed out by ASEAN Standing Committee Chairman and
Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi: "It has always
been the ASEAN's vision that all countries in the region be
together.
</P>
<P>
"By being together we can help each other prosper..., we can
enjoy each other's prosperity, which in itself brings us more
all-round benefits," he said in an interview with the local press
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Laos and Myanmar will also benefit greatly from their ASEAN
membership in economic terms as they are now expected to obtain
more capital and technology from the other ASEAN countries to
speed up their economic development.
</P>
<P>
With the region's all countries but one in the organization,
ASEAN can exert a greater influence in the Asia-Pacific region and
in the world as a whole. Its economy, one of the fastest growing
in the world in the past few years, is also expected to obtain a
boost.
</P>
<P>
Accepting Myanmar as a member by defying pressure from some
Western countries, which accused Myanmar of human rights
violations and thus opposed its inclusion in the regional group,
also shows the strong unity, independence and courage of ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Cambodia did not join ASEAN this time as hoped,
but it is the hope of ASEAN nations that the situation in the
country will return to normal soon and the dream of ASEAN 10 will
be realized in the near future.

<HEADLINE> Defending Champion China Returns to Macao for Volleyball GP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Olympic silver medalist China
will return to Macao for defending the Vittel Cup title in the leg
of this year's World Women's Volleyball Grand Prix on August 8-10.
</P>
<P>
China will be joined by Olympic teams United States, Russia and
Italy in the three-day event at the Forum de Macau called Vittel
Cup World Women's Volleyball Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
The World Women's Volleyball Grand Prix, now in its fifth year,
will feature six preliminary sites in the Asian region -- Jakarta,
Macao, Seoul, Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong, and Gifu in Japan. With
the month-long preliminaries starting on August 1, the Grand
Finals are set for Kobe in Japan.
</P>
<P>
The Macao event is jointly organized by the Macau Sports
Institute, Macau Volleyball Association and Spectrum.
</P>
<P>
China is once again tipped to be the favorites for the Macao
event. The Chinese won all their three matches in Macao to take
the Vittel Cup and the team finished third in the Grand Finals
later in Shanghai. Brazil and Cuba won the top two places in the
East China city.
</P>
<P>
With Brazil absent from this year's tournament, China's chance
has been greatly enhanced.
</P>
<P>
"I was very delighted when my team captured the Vittel Cup last
year. Although our team finished only third in the Grand Prix, it
still made me so proud because my players kept up their fighting
spirit during the whole competition," Lang Ping, head coach of the
Chinese national team, said recently.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese recently underwent a reshuffle, with six newcomers
recruited into the squad. The players now average 24.5 years at
age and 1.82 meters in height.
</P>
<P>
The United States team has set to improve from its poor finish
at last year's Atlanta Olympic Games. The World Grand Prix is to
be a starting point for the team, coached by Mick Haley, for their
preparations for the Olympic Games in Sydney in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Russia, third in the Vittel Cup last year, will return also
under the instruction of its long-time coach Nicolai Karpol. The
Russians are known for their powerful smashes, stable blocking and
safe receipt, which helped them to the Grand Finals at last year's
tournament after a two-year absence.
</P>
<P>
Italy took part in the 1994 World Grand Prix, in which they
finished eighth out of twelve teams. The Italians are hoping to
improve their standings in this year's event.

<HEADLINE> Canada Plans to Invest More in Plant and Equipment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Canadian business and government plan
to invest a record 80.5 billion U.S. dollars in plant and equipment in
1997, up 11 percent from 1996, Statistics Canada said today.
</P>
<P>
This is the fourth consecutive gain and the largest annual increase
in investment since 1993, the federal statistics agency noted.
</P>
<P>
The growth is evident in many sectors of the Canadian economy, most
notably the service-producing industries which account for 54 percent
of the increase.
</P>
<P>
This latest survey, conducted from April to June, shows much
stronger investment for 1997 with an increase of 4.8 billion dollars
from what was originally planned earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
With solid gains in production, Canadian companies are spending in
plant and equipment at record levels.
</P>
<P>
The bullish spending represents increased investment not only in
machinery and equipment, which is up 13 percent over last year, but
also in building and engineering assets, which is up nine percent.
</P>
<P>
"Leading the spending spree are companies involved in crude oil
exploration, leasing, telecommunications, pipelines and
manufacturing," the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Investment in housing is also strong and is expected to increase
13.3 percent to reach 25.9 billion dollars in 1997, the highest level
since 1990.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investments in S. Korea Soar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Direct foreign investments in South
Korea amounted to 4.46 billion U.S. dollars in the first half of
1997, the highest in history, the Ministry of Finance and Economy
(MOFA) said today.
</P>
<P>
The volume represented a 252 percent increase from 1.26 billion
dollars recorded in the same period last year and was 39.3 percent
more than the 3.23 billion dollars in the entire 1996.
</P>
<P>
Investments in non-manufacturing sectors, such as hotel and
distribution industries, jumped 800 percent to 3.35 billion
dollars while those in the manufacturing industry rose a modest
24.9 percent to 1.11 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Another noticeable trend is an increase in the size of
individual investment projects.
</P>
<P>
The average amount invested in a project increased from 6.82
million dollars to 8.76 million.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and European Union companies increased their investments
in the first half of 1997 by 496 percent and 273 percent to 2.07
and 1.47 billion dollars, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Growth in direct foreign investment in the nation has been
steep since 1993. MOFA officials said that the rapid growth
resulted from the gradual improvement of local investment climate
for foreigners, the wider opening of the domestic market, the
reduction of red tape and greater incentives.
</P>
<P>
"As a part of its market-opening measure, the government has
continuously simplified investment procedures for foreign
enterprises and extended various financial and policy support to
them," a ministry spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Emergency Services on Flood Alert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's emergency services have
been put on full alert as major northern rivers continue to rise
because of torrential rains over the past few days.
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee for Floods and Storms Control (CCFSC)
Tuesday warned 15 riverine provinces and cities in the north
against possible flooding.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the water in the Mekong River in the south is rising
slowly but is already threatening the delta of the river, the
country's biggest rice basket.
</P>
<P>
The committee said anti-flood measures already taken include the
manning of vulnerable spots along riverbanks and sea dikes so that
any break can be immediately plugged.
</P>
<P>
Hanoi authorities demanded the dike system be monitored long
before the water in the Red river rose to the present level.
</P>
<P>
The unseasonal heavy rains made it possible for the annual
floods to arrive several weeks earlier than usual in both the Red
river in the north and the Mekong river networks, CCFSC officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam uses a three-tiered monitoring and warning system for
water levels of rivers in the country.
</P>
<P>
The third level in Hanoi (at 11.50m) indicates that the water
of the Red river is likely to overflow its banks.
</P>
<P>
Currently Hanoi is on the second level warning, but a red alert
has been issued, because the water was climbing up to the third
level.
</P>
<P>
Last year's floods began in mid-August, a week before tropical
storm Niki lashed across the north from Thanh Hoa and killed about
100 fishermen off the coast.

<HEADLINE> First Dike Burst in Eastern German Flooded Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 23 (Xinhua) -- German authorities today reported the
first dike burst along the Oder River in eastern Germany after
water levels rose again in the morning.
</P>
<P>
Alwin Ziel, interior minister of the eastern German state of
Brandenburg, said that the rising Oder River, which marks the
border between Germany and Poland, burst banks near the village of
Brieskow-Finkenheerd in the morning, threatening a nearby flatland
of about 60 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Serious dike damages were also reported later at some other
locations along the Oder on the German side.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities said urgent measures were taken to evacuate
some 2,300 people from the flooded areas. Although evacuation
orders were issued on Tuesday, many local residents insisted that
they ride out the flood and protect their properties.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 people in the Ernst-Thaelmann residential area to the
south of the German border town Frankfurt-an-der-Oder have
reportedly tried to block their houses from rescue workers coming
to evacuate them.
</P>
<P>
For the matter of life and death, local authorities said they
would force the people to leave their homes if necessary.
</P>
<P>
At Frankfurt-an-der-Oder, the river has risen to its highest
level since 1933. Local officials said they were considering
bringing some 1,200 people to safety from some most dangerous
districts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the German cabinet agreed today to provide 20
million marks (11 million U.S. dollars) of emergency aid and up to
200 million marks (110 million dollars) of low-interest credits
for the flood-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
Floods over the past weeks have already ravaged 550,000
hectares of land in Poland and one third of the Czech Republic,
killing more than 100 people in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Germany's largest insurance company Allianz Tuesday estimated
the total damage so far in the three countries at more than 100
million marks (55 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> Zambian Union Calls for Retirement Age Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government was urged
today to reduce the retirement age so as to enable many to enjoy
their terminal benefits.
</P>
<P>
Leonard Hikaumba, national chairman of the Civil Servants
Union of Zambia (CSUZ), said in a speak-out program on Radio of
Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation that reduction of the
retirement age for union members will enable many to enjoy their
terminal benefits as the life expectancy in the country has
drastically come down in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Current life expectancy in Zambia is between 45 to 47 years,
he said, adding that his union does not see why the retirement
age in the country should not be brought down from 55 to 45
years.
</P>
<P>
On the impending civil service restructuring program the
government is about to implement, Hikaumba said the government
should not implement it without ensuring that all the funds to
pay those to be retrenched are available.
</P>
<P>
In Zambia when a worker retires he can get a package of
terminal benefits according to his years of service.

<HEADLINE> France Urges EU "Firmness" on Boeing-McDonnell Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac and
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin today urged the European Union (EU)
to keep a stand of "firmness" on the merger between the
U.S. aircraft makers Boeing and McDonnell-Douglas, which will make
Boeing the world's strongest plane maker.
</P>
<P>
EU officials said today that they are approaching a deal with
the United States over the Boeing-McDonnell Douglas combination,
after the latter made a last-minute concession to scrap exclusive
contracts on plane sales with U.S. air companies.
</P>
<P>
"The president and the government encourage the (European)
Commission in its position of firmness so that the principle of
respecting the rules of competition be respected," government
spokeswoman Catherine Trautmann said.
</P>
<P>
France, whose state-owned Aerospatiale group is a major
investor in the Airbus Consortium, is worried about the domination
by Boeing in world air market at the expense of the Airbus, the
only sophisticated passenger plane that can compete with Boeing
airliners.
</P>
<P>
A French Foreign Ministry spokesman said that France does not
know at the moment what concession the Boeing has made to reach a
compromise with the Europeans.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing-McDonnell Douglas merger needs to be approved by the
EU so that a trans-Atlantic trade war in air market can be avoided.
</P>
<P>
European officials have asked Boeing to drop its 20-year
exclusive contracts with three major U.S. air companies on plane
sales, which can turn the U.S. air market into its preserve
playground.
</P>
<P>
Karel Van Miert, the European commissioner in charge of
competition and anti-trust affairs, said today that the 20-member
European Commission will vote within eight days to approve the
merger of Boeing and McDonnell-Douglas Corp.

<HEADLINE> N. Mogadishu Militiamen Defect to South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Some 130 men armed with assault
rifles crossed the green line Tuesday and defected to the area
controlled by faction leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid in south
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The armed men including members from the former military
personnel and militiamen have defected from the faction led by
Ali Mahdi Mohamed of north Mogadishu on a broad day light by
marching from their base at the old seaport of south Mogadishu to
the presidential palace of Hussein Mohamed Aidid.
</P>
<P>
The defectors, the largest contingent ever crossing to south
Mogadishu, were welcomed by six battle wagons belonging to
Hussein Aidid's faction at the former gold market of Hamar Weyne,
where they were received by senior militia officials from Hussein
Aidid's government.
</P>
<P>
Radio South Mogadishu quoted Hussein Aidi as saying that the
militiamen are taking part in securing the stability and erasing
the green lines dividing the Somali capital.
</P>
<P>
Meeting the defectors at his presidential palace, Hussein
Mohamed Aidid encouraged them to play their role in bringing
peace to their people.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, a large number of the defectors were moved
to the former police training institute near the new seaport of
Mogadishu where they will be stationed until further notice,
while the rest were told to remain at the presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to Hussein Aidid's headquarters,
the defection was masterminded by Mohamed Omar Habeb, governor of
Banadir region and member of Ali Mahdi's Abgal clan, who made his
defection to south Mogadishu early last year.
</P>
<P>
Factional politics analysts explain the new defection as money
motivated tactics.
</P>
<P>
In his latest speech to the public, Hussein Aidid said his
government will soon start paying salaries to the operational
employees with priority given to the security forces.
</P>
<P>
Before the official defection was made, the defectors were
wooed by Habeb through under-ground contacts.
</P>
<P>
Politicians believe that the defection will open a new page
for the militia based politics and will create some liberty to
the movement of the militiamen who have not been able to cross
the green lines since the civil war broke out in 1991.
</P>
<P>
It will also minimize the hostility between the militiamen in
the war-torn capital who have long been engaged in clan related
fighting, they said.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the Islamic courts collapsed, Abgal politicians
including Habeb who defected to Aidid's faction have been
crossing to and fro the green line to exert their political
influence in north Mogadishu.

Fujian's imports decreased by 8.57 percent in the first
quarter of the year. The figure, however, rose sharply in the

Cultural Center.
</P>
<P>
Stanley Ho, managing director of the STDM, who signed the
revised contract today, called it a "significant act in the life
of the STDM."
</P>
<P>
"I am most pleased with the fact that due to the good
relationship prevailing between Portugal and the People's Republic
of China, it has been possible to reach this moment when we sign a
contract that, while remaining in force beyond the end of the
Portuguese administration, will bring meaningful benefits to the
progress of Macao and the well-being of its population," he said
in a speech.
</P>
<P>
The STDM first got monopoly of Macao's casinos in 1962, and has
got its contracts renewed ever since. The latest contract, whose
term lasts until 2001, is the result of years of discussions in
the JLG.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton's special envoy Stephen Solarz said today the Paris Peace
Accord, which ended the Cambodian civil war in 1991, should be
respected and upheld in solving the political crisis in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. position on this is very clear," Solarz told

Badawai.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is clear that everyone believes that the Paris
Peace Accord should be respected and upheld in a solution to
the Cambodian crisis and the challenge now is to find a way to do
that," said Solarz, who is expected to meet foreign ministers of
Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines.
</P>

He said that the United States and the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will have the best chance of
achieving an acceptable resolution of the Cambodian crisis if they
could find a way to work together.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 23 (Bernama) -- Malaysia today welcomed
Cambodia's "open sky" policy, saying it will enable Malaysia
Airlines (MAS) to increase its weekly flights to Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik said today that MAS
could increase its weekly flights from four to eight to meet the
demand especially from businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Malaysians are the biggest foreign investors in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Ling told reporters that besides MAS, Malaysia's other regional
airlines such as Air Asia and Seaga Air could also fly to Cambodia
with the "open sky" policy announced yesterday in Phnom Penh by
Cambodian Second Prime Minister Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen had said his government would allow other airlines to
fly to Phnom Penh because Cambodia's national carrier, Royal Air
Cambodge, had suffered losses amounting to 24 million US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Nankun Railway to Become Operational in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The electrification of the Nankun
Railway, a major rail line in southwest China, will soon be
completed.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Railways said that it will go into operation as
of November 30.
</P>
<P>
Track-laying work on the nearly 900 km railway, from Nanning,
capital of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, to this capital
of Yunnan Province, finished March 18 this year.
</P>
<P>
It was one of the most difficult railways to build, with a
gradient of as much as 2,010 m and the highest railway bridge in
the country, as well as many steep slopes, making high-power
locomotives necessary.
</P>
<P>
So far, all projects in the electrification process are nearing
completion. More than 80 percent of the power equipment has been
installed. Sources say that the electrification effort will
help reduce pollution. Areas alongside the line are poor, but have
been protected well environmentally, they assured.
</P>
<P>
Construction work on the railway, involving a total investment
of 9.2 billion yuan, began in December 1990. The line is expected
to benefit 20 million people.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The major economic and financial
indicators of this south China's special economic zone
improved considerably in the first half of this year, the "Shanghai
Securities News" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen's gross domestic product (GDP) grew 16.5 percent on a
yearly basis to 46.3 billion yuan (about 5.5 billion US dollars)
in the January-June period, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the city's local fiscal revenue in the first six
months surged 33.4 percent from a year ago to more than 6.9
billion yuan, which is 55.9 percent of the budgeted figure for the
this year.
</P>
<P>
As the fiscal revenue grew at a rate twice that of the GDP, the
revenue as a proportion of the GDP had risen to 14.6 percent by
June, markedly higher than the national average.
</P>
<P>
Official figures also show that securities turnover in Shenzhen
totaled more than 1.2 trillion yuan-worth in the first six months,
about 4.6 times that of the same 1996 period. Of this amount,
stock trading soared 5.3 times from a year ago to nearly 1.1
trillion yuan-worth.

<HEADLINE> Australia Wants To Pressure New Zealand Over Defense: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- A second secret document prepared
for a South Pacific economic summit shows that Australia's federal
cabinet has agreed to work together to pressure New Zealand to
increase its defense spending, the Australian Associated Press
(AAP) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The document reveals that the cabinet agreed on February 10 all
Australian ministers were to pursue a whole-of-government approach
in their relations with their New Zealand counterparts, the AAP
said.
</P>
<P>
To that extent, Australian Treasurer Peter Costello was
encouraged to use bilateral talks with New Zealand Deputy Prime
Minister Winston Peters to push Australia's case for ensuring New
Zealand maintained its defense spending, even at the expense of
funding for social programs.
</P>
<P>
The briefing paper obtained by the AAP says: "your meeting with
Peters could be influential in swaying him in favor of Australia's
concerns, thereby reducing the prospect of future of Australian
budgetary subsidization of inadequate New Zealand defense
funding."
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Prime Minister Jim Bolger has indicated he might
raise the issue of the secret paper with his Australian
counterpart John Howard when they meet on Saturday in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
The emergence of a 39-page briefing prepared for bilateral
talks after the South Pacific Forum economic ministers' meeting
followed the publication last week of scathing assessments in
another secret report which accused several leaders of being
drunks and corrupt, and some countries of being close to economic
collapse.
</P>
<P>
The revelations have strained relations between Australia and
the pacific nations.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of some South Pacific nations, including Fiji, the Cook
Island, Nauru and the Solomon Islands, have indicated that they
will confront Prime Minister John Howard over the report.
</P>
<P>
Papua New Guinea's Acting Foreign Minister Chris Haiveta, who
was described in the report as former Prime Minister Julius Chan's
"lickspittle", today said one of his first acts as caretaker
foreign minister would be to ask for the secret report through
official channels.
</P>
<P>
Australia's Opposition defense spokesman Arch Bevis said New
Zealand had every right to be outraged at the cabinet's decision
to exert pressure on it to increase its defense spending at the
expense of social programs.
</P>
<P>
The first secret report described Winston Peters, the New
Zealand deputy prime minister, as erratic and an opportunist and
accused New Zealand of having a growing dependence on Australia,
especially in economic and in defense terms.
</P>
<P>
Treasurer Costello's office announced that the "exhaustive"
inquiry into security arrangements would be extended to include
the second secret document and that "the full range of
disciplinary and legal procedures would be pursued."
</P>
<P>
Australian Acting Opposition Leader Gareth Evans said another
mislaid document meant another red face for Costello.
</P>
<P>
"Another day, another foreign policy disaster", the former
foreign minister said.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Welcomes Laos, Myanmar as New Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PETALING JAYA, Malaysia, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) today extended its warm welcome to
Laos and Myanmar, which officially became full members of the
regional grouping at a ceremony held here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony in this township just outside Kuala
Lumpur, the Malaysian capital, ASEAN Standing Committee Chairman
and Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi called on all
the members to "continue to practice dialogue and consultation in
order to preserve and enhance the credibility of the ASEAN."
</P>
<P>
He also described the principle of non-interference as "one of
the cardinal principles of interstate relations," which he said
should be "scrupulously adhered to."
</P>
<P>
Badawi called on the ASEAN countries to work in unison to
safeguard the cohesiveness of the organization, noting that "the
ASEAN's strength lies in our shared experiences and future
aspirations."
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said in his statement,
"with the admission of Laos and Myanmar into ASEAN membership, we
are now but a single step away from the realization of the vision
of the founding fathers of our association of an ASEAN-10, that
is, all the 10 countries of Southeast Asia living in harmony and
working together for peace and prosperity within the ASEAN fold."
</P>
<P>
He said he remains hopeful that the entry of Cambodia, whose
admission had been planned but was later deferred because of the
factional fighting in the country, could take place very soon.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that "the enlargement of the ASEAN's
membership from seven to nine will undoubtedly strengthen our
association and increase its collective capability to promote
regional as well as global peace and security."
</P>
<P>
Singapore Foreign Minister S. Jayakumar in his statement
expressed the confidence that "the integration of Laos and Myanmar
into the ASEAN will be a successful and smooth exercise."
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, "an expanded ASEAN is only the
beginning of an exciting journey for the states in the region."
"The challenge for the ASEAN is to remain robust and united. The
ASEAN will be able to build on its strength if all the member
countries continue to work closely together and remain cohesive."
</P>
<P>
Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon described the
admission as "a most significant event in the life of our
association."
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that the goal is not simply to have the ASEAN
grow in size. "More importantly, we want the ties among ourselves
to deepen and strengthen so that the ASEAN will one day become a
genuine regional community."
</P>
<P>
He urged all the members to work together to build a true
regional community that "will enrich and liberate our peoples
beyond the levels we know today."
</P>
<P>
"Only with such a commitment will we leave to the posterity a
vibrant and enduring ASEAN," he declared.
</P>
<P>
Thai Foreign Minister Prachuab Chaiyasarn stressed that the
ASEAN's solidarity, cooperation and expansion of activities
coupled with the identified links between the ASEAN and friendly
countries, as well as other organizations have resulted in peace,
security and sustainable development of the region.
</P>
<P>
"As ASEAN members, Laos and Myanmar are now eligible to
participate in ASEAN activities, are entitled to the same
privileges and would assume the same responsibilities as all other
members in our task to build a more peaceful, stable and
prosperous Southeast Asia," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam said in his
statement that the expansion of the ASEAN to embrace Laos and
Myanmar "is of great importance, putting an end to the dividing
Southeast Asia and opening up the prospect of a united Southeast
Asia of peace and cooperation for development."
</P>
<P>
"For the first time in their history, Southeast Asian countries
are marching hand in hand under a single regional organization,
namely ASEAN," he added.
</P>
<P>
Brunei Foreign Minister Mohamed Bolkiah called the admission a
"very happy occasion," saying the entry of the two countries
"means they are no longer just neighbors but partners."
</P>
<P>
Another ceremony was held later to raise the national flags of
the two new member countries in front of the venue of the 30th
ASEAN Ministerial Meeting, which will start here tomorrow and will
now also be attended by the Lao and Myanmar foreign ministers.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Myanmar's Entry into ASEAN Contributes to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar, after standing alone for
several decades, finally joined the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) today, opening a new chapter in its foreign
relations.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar, together with Laos, officially became members of the
regional grouping, boosting the number of ASEAN members from seven
to nine and marking a step closer towards the organization's dream
of including all ten Southeast Asian countries in its membership.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's scheduled entry into the regional grouping along
with Laos and Myanmar was postponed indefinitely following a
decision made at the special meeting of the ASEAN foreign
ministers on July 10 because of the latest developments in Phnom
Penh.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN presently groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's entry into ASEAN contributes not only to the
development of the country but also to peace, stability and
development of the region.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, Myanmar participated in the 27th ASEAN
Ministerial Meeting held in Bangkok in July 1994 as a guest of the
Thai government.
</P>
<P>
It became an observer of ASEAN at the grouping's 29th
Ministerial Meeting held in Jakarta in July 1996 after its
accession to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia
at the Brunei Ministerial Meeting in July 1995.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's integration into the regional grouping is seen as not
only an opportunity for the country in the development of its
economy and trade and attraction of foreign investment, but also a
challenge to it in commodity production and market
competitiveness, some observers here believed.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Southeast Asian countries,
such as Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines, are
investing in Myanmar with nearly 3 billion U.S. dollars out of the
country's total foreign investment of over 6 billion U.S. dollars
from 21 countries and regions at the end of May this year.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's joining of ASEAN would also contribute to the
transport sector of the Southeast Asian region. The eventual
establishment of regional highway and railway networks would in
turn promote the economic development of the region.
</P>
<P>
The country's admission into ASEAN also poses a challenge to
its market competitiveness in commodity export since Myanmar is
industrially weak to produce goods for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that Myanmar's economy would be
developed at a relatively quicker pace with technical assistance
and support of other member countries of ASEAN.

<HEADLINE> Book Fair Becomes a Major Hit in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 23 (Xinhua) -- A book fever is now bringing a
major hit to the residents of Hong Kong, following the opening
here today of the Eighth Hong Kong Book Fair.
</P>
<P>
A leading executive of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council
(TDC) predicted that Hong Kong's importance as a regional
publishing and printing hub for both English and Chinese language
books will be increased as Asian economies continue to expand.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the book fair at the Hong
Kong Convention and Exhibition Center (HKCEC), Michael Sze, TDC's
Executive Director, said the fast developing local printing and
publishing industry is sure to continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's printing companies have invested heavily to expand
production and maximize quality, and this has helped them at a
time when many potential overseas partners are seeking joint
ventures to enter into Asian markets where the demand for high
quality publications is high, he said.
</P>
<P>
The TDC-sponsored book fair has played a significant role in
promoting Hong Kong's book market and enhancing its development as
 a leading book trading center in the Asia region, Sze said.
</P>
<P>
TDC this year broke new ground with the launching of the
inaugural International Copyright Exchange (ICE) and Printing
Services Exhibition at the fair to further boost the trade aspects
of the local printing and publishing services.
</P>
<P>
Lam Woon-kwong, Secretary for the Civil Service, said at the
opening ceremony that the book fair is a showcase for all kinds of
books as well as an ideal trading forum for local and Asian
publishers.
</P>
<P>
He said that by launching the ICE and Printing Services
Exhibition, Hong Kong's position as the copyright trading,
production and printing center in Asia will also be enhanced.
</P>
<P>
A sound legal system, together with the commitment to safeguard
intellectual property rights, the availability of first-class
publishing, production and printing technologies, and direct
access to information and freedom of publication make Hong Kong an
important publishing and right trading center.
</P>
<P>
This year's book fair has a much larger space for placing
exhibition booths, following the completion of the Extension of
the HKCEC. The fair features more than 400 exhibitors with 800
booths in 25,000 square meters of exhibition space.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 visitors lined up in long queues outside the
HKCEC before the fair's opening this morning. Some had been
there overnight. Such long queues are a rare scene even in Hong
Kong which is known for its ability and success to host
international conventions and exhibitions.

<HEADLINE> Famine, Epidemic Threaten S. Leonean Population </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Famine and epidemic of alarming
proportions have begun to threaten the Sierra Leonean population
due to the isolation imposed by the international community since
the May 25 coup.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here today, the blockade of sea
ports and airports by the west African peacekeeping force
(ECOMOG) has led to skyrocketing prices of foodstuffs and
deteriorating health conditions.
</P>
<P>
Diseases and epidemic such as cholera and diarrhea mainly
broke out in unhygienic conditions.
</P>
<P>
Since the coup that overthrew the elected civilian government
led by President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, a good number of medical
workers have reportedly fled the country while fresh supplies of
medicine dried up.
</P>
<P>
The poor housing called shanties also contributed to the
collapse of the public health system.
</P>
<P>
Ships carrying food items and other daily necessities bound
for the capital Freetown have turned to neighboring countries due
to the tense situation there, leaving little hope for the
empty-shelved shops to take in fresh stocks.
</P>
<P>
International aid agencies have pointed out that the situation
in Sierra Leone have become desperate because of the political
isolation.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone's coupists led by Major Johnny Koroma have been
under condemnation worldwide. The United Nations and Organization
of African Unity have endorsed the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) to take all means to restore democracy in
the troubled country.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG troops have clashed with soldiers loyal to the Koroma
regime and a group of militiamen known as Revolutionary United
Front, which has been fighting successive governments of the
country since 1991.
</P>
<P>
A series of meetings have also been held in Abidjan, capital
of Cote d'Ivoire, between ECOWAS leaders and the coupists towards
resolving the crisis. A ceasefire was reached last weekend as a
fresh breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS Committee of Four on Sierra Leone, made up of
foreign ministers of Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea and Cote d'Ivoire,
and the 14-man delegation of the Koroma government decided to
meet again on July 25.
</P>
<P>
As a sign to show ECOWAS' implementation of the ceasefire,
ECOMOG troops last Sunday lifted its blockade on all roads to
Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Despite international appeal for an immediate step-down,
Koroma's military government has said they need nearly two years
to organize a new civilian government which they would finally
hand over.

HONG KONG, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Over 200 economists from all

the strategic development of the economy of Hong Kong as part of
China after 1997".
</P>

open to Hong Kong as well as the constraints to growth after 1997
and the complementarities" between Hong Kong and China's inland
areas, the paper added.

<P>
A group of Tamil rebels raided the Pattanangala Fisheries
Harbor near Yala National Park last night and set ablaze 32
fishing vessels and 22 camps of migrant fishermen.

All fishermen were ordered out of their camps and questioned at
length by the rebels on the whereabouts of a military detachment.
</P>
<P>
The fishermen were released unharmed this morning, police said.
But some fishermen were ordered by the rebels to flee the harbor
and they were still trapped in the surrounding jungles.
</P>
<P>
Troops were sent this morning to bring the fishermen back and
also to hunt the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Tamil rebels, fighting for a separate state in the

MACAO, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 800 Macao students are going
to attend China's inland universities this coming September, but
the number is down slightly from last year.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Daily News reported today that among all the
enrolled, more than 600 will go to the Ji'nan University in
Guangzhou, in south China's Guangdong Province and the Overseas
Chinese University in Xiamen city, Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the total number was recorded at 849, an increase of
286 over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
A record 1,680 students took the entrance examination to inland
universities this year, a 25 percent increase over last year's
figure.
</P>
<P>
The total number of applicants to inland institutions of higher
learning since they started enrolling Macao students in 1984 has
topped 8,600.
</P>
<P>
Lei Pui Lam, vice-president of the Macao Education Association,
 said the rising enthusiasm for inland universities was closely
connected with the upcoming return of Macao to China in 1999.
</P>
<P>
He said that as Macao's return to the motherland draws near,
Macao students are beginning to have more confidence in the
universities in the inland areas, and they can choose the right
majors they are interested in there.

<HEADLINE> Manila Hails Entry of Laos, Myanmar Into ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today welcomed the entry of Laos and Myanmar into the seven-nation
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
"We welcomes the entry of Laos and Myanmar into the ASEAN
family," Ramos said in a statement issued by his press office.
</P>
<P>
Laos and Myanmar were formally admitted today as full members
of ASEAN during the 30th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting being held in a
city near the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old ASEAN previously grouped the Philippines,
Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, Brunei and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Describing the expansion as a "historic event," Ramos said it
brought ASEAN only a step away from the fulfillment of the vision
of its founders -- one Southeast Asia united in ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines and the rest of ASEAN looked forward to working
with the two new members for the peace, stability and security of
Southeast Asia, he said.
</P>
<P>
The entry of Laos and Myanmar into ASEAN offers larger
opportunities for closer and more intensive political, economic
and human relationships between the Philippines and the two
countries, Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
He said ASEAN's expansion affords a larger forum for the
discussion of issues common to Southeast Asia and of problems that
can affect the security, stability and progress in the region.
</P>
<P>
Ramos also expressed the hope that Cambodia will eventually
join ASEAN when the situation there normalizes.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia was supposed to join the regional bloc along with Laos
and Myanmar but its accession was postponed early this month due
to political instability in that country.
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to the eventual membership of Cambodia into
ASEAN once the situation in that country settles and clarifies in
a manner consistent with its constitutional requirements and
international commitments," Ramos said.

ISLAMABAD, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Many previous records were
broken on the Karachi Stock Exchange Tuesday as the index soared
by a record 104.06 points, piercing through the 2,000
psychological barrier.
</P>
<P>
The KSE index settled at an all-time high of 2,016.51 points
after the close of computerized trading on Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The market capitalization also hit an all-time peak at 610
billion rupees (about 15 billion U.S. dollars). The volume figure
also improved its overnight all-time single-session record of 210
million shares to reach 244.5 million.
</P>
<P>
It is the second sharp rise of the Index in just two days. The
Monday session saw the index shooting up by 78 points to break the
1,900 mark and close at 1,912.45.
</P>
<P>
The stock market boom was seen by Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz
as an indicator of reviving business confidence related to the
various incentive packages announced by the government since it
took office in February.
</P>
<P>
Analysts and brokers see at least three main reasons for the
new upbeat mood at the stock market.
</P>
<P>
The most basic reason may be the increasing possibility of
reaching an agreement on Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility
(ESAF) with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as negotiations
with an IMF mission are continuing on an optimistic note, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
In fact, this has been described as a fundamental factor which
the market had been watching for, they said.
</P>
<P>
The government is expected to reach an agreement today with the
IMF on Policy Framework Paper for the about 1 billion U.S. dollars
ESAF, a soft facility with a half percent rate on the interest,
Aziz announced Tuesday after meeting with Paul Chabrier, Executive
Director of the Fund.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the ESAF requirements have already been met through
our economic reform packages," Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
The second reason ascribed by the analysts to the strong
sentiment in the stock market is the recent change effected in the
index of the Karachi stock market, which weighted it more strongly
towards the higher performing, bigger volume traders like Pakistan
Telecommunications Company Limited (PTCL) and Hubco Power. Hubco
and PTCL alone have a weightage of 53 percent in the price index.
</P>
<P>
A third and key factor is the inflow of funds as a consequence
of the on-going turmoil in many Asian markets particularly the
Philippines and Thailand due to their current financial problems.
</P>
<P>
News that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was to visit the Karachi
Stock Exchange this morning is believed to be another factor
behind the all-time high trading.
</P>
<P>
Sharif's visit was regarded as a good omen for the country's
capital market which already has received ample support from the
government, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Polls: Kromah Vows Not to Accept Verdict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Liberia's presidential contestant
Alhaji Kromah has vowed not to accept the outcome of the election
as results announced so far point to a landslide victory for
Charles Taylor.
</P>
<P>
Latest figure provided by the Independent Elections Commission
(IECOM) shows that Taylor of the National Patriotic Party has won
366,548, or 75.4 percent, of the votes already counted.
</P>
<P>
Of the 472,863 valid votes so far declared, his closest rival,
Unity Party's woman candidate Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf scored 45,195
or 9.53 percent, while Kromah, a former major warlord now running
on the platform of the All Liberian Coalition Party, received
only 20,494, or 4.34 percent.
</P>
<P>
Results announced so far came from 1,344 polling stations out
of a total of 1,864 centers throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
To emerge as a president-elected, a candidate needs to win 51
percent of the total valid votes, otherwise a run-off will be
held.
</P>
<P>
Although the final result is to be announced by IECOM Chairman
Henry Andrews later today in the capital Monrovia, Taylor's
current victory is believed to make the run-off unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
Kromah, who fought against Taylor for control of the
government of Liberia, however, alleged on Tuesday serious
irregularities, even though most observers had said the election
was free, fair and credible.
</P>
<P>
"This is no election," Kromah, the one-time ally with Taylor
in the country's civil war, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The elections that we see here are marred with numerous
things. Some very very illogical, some directly offensive to the
election proceedings. All combine to show that we are making a
big mockery of democracy and this result is totally unacceptable
to the All Liberia Coalition Party," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, a worrisome development following
Taylor's victory is that tension seems to be mounting within the
ranks of remnants of late president Samuel Doe's loyalists in the
Armed Forces of Liberia, chiefly the Krahn ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
Taylor rose up seven years ago in a rebellion to fight against
Doe, attempting to seize the presidency by force of arms, thus
igniting the civil war that claimed the life of more than 150,000
people and left even more homeless.
</P>
<P>
Observers say the Krahns fear that the future government of
Taylor would involve in the restructuring of the Liberian army,
an issue which is the responsibility of the west African
peace-keeping force (ECOMOG).
</P>
<P>
According to the Krahns, the army restructured by Taylor would
be to their disadvantage.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Navy to Cut Servicemen by 30,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Navy will cut its
servicemen by about 30,000 before 1998, Navy Commander-in-Chief
Adm. Feliks Gromov announced at a news conference in Vladivostok
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Russia's navy, which amounts to 227,000 men, will complete its
reform step by step, the Interfax news agency quoted Gromov as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Gromov said ships that do not meet the existing requirements
will be decommissioned, all supply structures will be streamlined
and new equipment is due to be introduced.
</P>
<P>
The fact that Russia's navy accounts for a third of the
country's nuclear potential "must certainly be taken into
consideration during reform of the armed forces," he added.
</P>
<P>
On plans of reduction in the Pacific Fleet, Gromov said that
two major bases, one in Kamchatka and the other in Primorye, are
expected to remain.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the reform of the Pacific Fleet and major
reductions would take place from 1997 to the year of 2001.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the navy is doing its best to maintain the high
technological capabilities of defense industry enterprises in the
Far East, said Gromov.

<P>
LAGOS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government is to
increase its budget this year for oil industry by one billion
U.S. Dollars, the Vanguard reported today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after negotiations with the oil
companies, which have repeatedly threatened to cut production if
their financial difficulties are not relieved.
</P>
<P>
The new increase would make a total 3.02 billion Dollars

</P>
<P>
Plus the funds from foreign partners, the country's total
spending on oil industry would hit 4.5 billion Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources are optimistic that the new development would
ensure the achievement of the country's goal of producing 2.2
million barrels of crude oil a day in 1997.
</P>
<P>
It will also have a positive impact on the goal of 2.5 million

<HEADLINE> US Deploys 120 Trainers to Senegal, Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The U. S. is deploying about 120
peacekeeping trainers to Senegal and Uganda in the first visible
step in the implementation of African Crisis Response Initiative
(ACRI), local paper "Cameroun Tribune" reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, the ACRI is a training initiative
intended to work cooperatively with African states to create
rapidly deployable peace-keeping units, which can operate jointly
in event of humanitarian operation.
</P>
<P>
The initivative's emphasis on training, according to Nicholas
Burns, the U.S. State Department Spokesman, is based on a common
peace-keeping doctrine and the supply of communications equipment
which will enable the units to work more effectively together,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Burns said the U.S. continue to work closely with the U.K. and
France as well as African and other interested nations to
actively explore mechanisms for coordination of practical
activities, and toward the establishment of an African
peace-keeping support group.
</P>
<P>
Senegal and Uganda were among the first group of African
nations prepared to participate in the ACRI with battalion-size

<HEADLINE> 3,700 Recruited in North, West Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan army has recruited
700 former rebels in the north and the Ugandan government also
recruited 3,000 local defense units members in the west to cope
with rebels' activities, "The New Vision" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Colonel James Kazini, commander of the Fourth Division of the
Ugandan army, said his troops recruited former rebels of the West
Nile Bank Front (WNBF) aged between 17 and 25, who had
surrendered to the army in March and April this year in Arua
District.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan army freed 234 members of WNBF but held another
734 members of WNBF in custody, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The WNBF is a crippled rebel group which was acting in the
northwest. But recent reports said Juma Oris, the leader of WNBF,
joined Sudanese government troops and Lord's resistance Army
(LRA) with his remnants to fight Sudan People's Liberation Army
in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The recruited ex-rebels are now receiving training in barracks
in northern Gulu District, he added.
</P>
<P>
Northern districts of Gulu and Kitgum have been haunts of the
LRS rebels. Joseph Kony, the leader of LRA, has ordered his
subordinates to go underground in the area, an earlier report
said.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government recruited 300 members of the local
defense units in 10 western districts to deal with prevailing
situations, Mukasa Muruli, the minister of security in the
president's office, said.
</P>
<P>
The western part of the country is harassed by the rebels of
the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) from time to time.
</P>
<P>
The ADF is a rebel group acting in the west which had some
1,000 members last November but now its ranks have been reduced
to only 400-500 members.

local paper "Cameroun Tribune" reported today.
</P>
<P>

in the seminar which was organized by the South West Development
Authority (SOWEDA).
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, Project Manager of SOWEDA Eneme Ngome

<HEADLINE> Thailand Able to Liberalize Seven Sectors by 2020 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will be able to
liberalize seven sectors ahead of the 2020 free trade deadline set
by Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), according to a
Bangkok Post report today.
</P>
<P>
The seven sectors are fish and canned and processed seafood,
canned and processed fruits and vegetables, rice and rice
products, natural and synthetic rubber, energy, medical equipment
and supplies, and gems and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
APEC requests its members to propose sectors for liberalization
ahead of its goal of establishing free trade and investment by the
year 2010 for developed members and 2020 for developing economies.
</P>
<P>
Thai Commerce Ministry officials have discussed reducing import
tariffs on fresh and frozen fish to 0 to 2 percent by 2003, and
canned and processed seafood to 0 to 5 percent by 2005.
</P>
<P>
But they did not discuss liberalization timeframes for all
sectors.
</P>
<P>
The liberalization proposal has been approved by Prime Minister
Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, who chairs the International Economic
Policy Committee of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Officials believe that liberalizing some fishery products such
as fresh and frozen fish, used as raw ingredients by Thai canning
industries, would boost Thailand's export capability.
</P>
<P>
But Thailand would benefit fully only if other APEC members,
such the United States, Canada and Japan, also cut their import
tariffs as these members accounted for 59 percent of Thailand's
total exports of canned and processed seafood.
</P>
<P>
Concerning rice, Thailand's main agricultural export item, a
Commerce Ministry source said further negotiations need to be
held, but Thailand is likely to be able to reduce its rice import
tariffs to 0 to 5 percent by 2004.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is the world's largest exporter of rice, with about 5
million tons exported each year.
</P>
<P>
If APEC members liberalize their rice sector, Thailand's rice
exports will grow, as many APEC members produce only enough rice
for domestic consumption and apply non-tariff measures to protect
their domestic markets.
</P>
<P>
On the natural and synthetic rubber sector, the source said
trade of natural rubber among APEC economies was high.
</P>
<P>
About 63 percent of Thailand's total rubber exports are in the
form of rubber sheets, while rubber blocks and rubber resin each
accounted for 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
Japan (35 percent), China (24 percent) and the United States
(14 percent) are the largest buyers of Thai rubber exports.
</P>
<P>
Thailand might propose complete removal of import tariffs on
rubber by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Tariffs on canned and processed vegetables and fruits are
likely to be reduced to 0 to 5 percent by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has proposed liberalizing energy and medical equipment
as it now has to import these products, so lowering trade barriers
will benefit Thai users.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's private sector has initiated liberalizing the gems
and jewelry sector as it is expected to stimulate investment in
the country and boost jobs for skilled workers.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Down on Interest Rate Cut Prospect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed down
after the consumer price index (CPI) released today was
interpreted as boosting the case for an interest rate cut in the
near term.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics said CPI fell 0.2 percent
in the June quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank of Australia is widely tipped to cut the 5.5
percent cash rate in the next few weeks, or perhaps as early as
Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Treasury's underlying inflation rate rose 0.3
percent in June quarter, while the annual inflation rate stood at
1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The slightly better-than-expected results led the Australian
dollar more than a quarter of a US cent lower on the day.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished at 73.74 US cents, down from
74.08 previously.
</P>
<P>
The foreign exchange market has taken a negative view on the
chance of an easing in monetary policy as it believes an interest
cut could decrease the attractiveness of Australian dollar
denominated assets in the eyes of offshore investors.
</P>
<P>
On cross-rates today, the local unit ended at 84.97 from 86.15
against the Japanese yen and at 1.3415 from 1.3361 against the
German mark.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Australia's youth unemployment
rate ranked among the top 10 of the industrialized nations,
according to a United Nations report released today.
</P>
<P>
The report ranked Australia, Canada and Portugal equally at
number nine with a youth jobless rate of 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the spectrum, Austria and Switzerland
reported a six percent rate, while the United States came in 14th
with 12 percent, said the report published by the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launch of the report, Justice Marcus Einfeld
from the UNICEF said that the disturbing result was one of
Australia's "biggest current human rights tragedies", the
Australian Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
The effects of youth unemployment were felt not only by those
who suffered from the lack of jobs first hand, but also by the
families of the children searching for work, he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on all Australians to spare no effort in addressing
what he described as "tragedies."
</P>
<P>
"Youth unemployment is not just about statistics, public
opinion polls and wages, it is a moral issue that impacts the
whole of society," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, Australia's unemployment rate
was 8.5 percent in June, compared with 8.8 percent in May.

<HEADLINE> Israeli President Meets With PNA Deputy Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 23 (Xinhua) -- As part of the efforts to
restart the peace process, Israeli President Ezer Weizman held
talks overnight with Mahmoud Abbas (or Abu Mazen), deputy head of
the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
At Weizman's residence in Jerusalem, the two leaders discussed
ways to advance the peace negotiations that have been stalled
since mid-March when Israel began the construction of the Har Homa
settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Ambassador to Israel Mohammed Bassiouny and Weizman's
bureau chief Arye Shumer attended the meeting, which received
blessings from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Weizman stressed Israel's insistence on an end
to terrorism. Abbas brought a message to Weizman from PNA
President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Tuesday, Weizman met with Shimon Peres, former
leader of the opposition Labor Party, to discuss the current
situation. The president was scheduled to receive a Labor
delegation today, which will persuade him to play a more positive
role in preventing a collapse of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Although being a ceremonial head of state, Weizman has been
active in bridging the gap between Israel and the PNA during
difficult times in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday in Brussels, Belgium, Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy held talks with Arafat under the sponsorship of the European
Union, whose Foreign Ministers were holding a meeting.
</P>
<P>
This was the highest level contact between the two sides since
the two met in Malta in April at the European-Mediterranean
Conference.
</P>
<P>
Levy described the Tuesday meeting as having made great
strides in sweetening the bitterness of the five months of
acrimony over the deadlocked talks.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said "significant and positive steps have been taken" by
the two sides to restart the peace process, but he did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Israel's Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh and the
U.S. Middle East peace coordinator Dennis Ross met to discuss
Israel's new ideas on breaking the ice in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Among the new ideas was a proposal for moving to the "fast
track" of the final-status talks in order to conclude them quickly.
</P>
<P>
Naveh said after the meeting that Israel needed to be sure that
the Palestinian side would meet its commitment to combating
terrorism. He added Israel was demanding a serious crackdown on
Palestinian police officers allegedly involved in anti-Israeli
terror attacks.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the new ideas he had presented to the
U.S. included a halt to the Har Homa construction, Naveh replied
that everything he presented "is very clearly consistent with the
government's policy."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government was reportedly proposing a temporary halt
to the Har Homa construction by Israel in exchange for PNA's
crackdown on terrorism and resumption of security cooperation with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
So far, Israel has not yet indicated its willingness to make
concessions on the issue of Har Homa, which the PNA said were
necessary to rebuild confidence for future talks.
</P>
<P>
Despite the recent intensive diplomatic efforts to bring the
two sides back to the negotiating table, no specific date has
been set for the resumption of the peace talks.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Upholds Decision Not to Admit Cambodia Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PETALING JAYA, Malaysia, July 23 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN foreign
ministers at a special meeting here today decided to uphold their
earlier decision to defer the admission of Cambodia into the
regional grouping.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers made the decision because ASEAN (the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations) was of the view that there
is "still instability in Cambodia" and "ASEAN still considers
(Norodom) Ranariddh as the First Prime Minister of Cambodia,"
Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi told a news
conference after the special meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said the decision came after the foreign ministers listened
to the report by Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, who led
an ASEAN delegation which also included the foreign ministers of
the Philippines and Thailand to meet Cambodian King Norodom
Sihanouk, Ranariddh and Second Prime Minister Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian foreign minister added that the foreign ministers
also considered the latest statements by Hun Sen and Cambodian
Foreign Minister Ung Huot.
</P>
<P>
Ung Huot wrote to all the seven ASEAN foreign ministers seeking
Cambodia's admission into ASEAN today, said Abdullah, who is also
chairman of the ASEAN Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said Hun Sen who refused ASEAN's role during his
meeting with the ASEAN delegation in resolving the current
Cambodian crisis changed his stand by acknowledging an ASEAN role,
which he described as "more positive".
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian foreign minister said it seems there is a
possibility for ASEAN to continue its role to bring about
reconciliation in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Ali Alatas along with his counterparts of the Philippines and
Thailand will meet with Ung Huot here later this afternoon to
inform him of the latest decision and discuss other subjects
related to ASEAN's role.
</P>
<P>
Today's special meeting was held just hours before ASEAN
formally welcomed Laos and Myanmar as full members.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said Cambodia however still holds the status as an
observer of ASEAN.

<HEADLINE> Marketing of Formula Milk in Thailand Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bangkok, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Public Health Ministry is
considering to regulate the marketing of breast milk substitutes
after producers have been found to be violating an international
code.
</P>
<P>
Breast milk substitutes producers in Thailand are found to be
promoting their products by offering free or low-priced samples of
infant formula milk to mothers and hospitals for infants under six
months old.
</P>
<P>
This practice has violated a code adopted by the World Health
Organization (WHO) in 1981, which prevents the promotion of breast
milk substitutes for infants under six months old.
</P>
<P>
A report by the United Nations International Children's Fund
(UNICEF), available today, said reducing the use of infant formula
milk and further promoting breast-feeding, especially during the
first six months of life, could save the lives of 1.5 million
children each year worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Citing a 1996 survey of 800 mothers in Bangkok and adjacent
provinces, the report noted that more than 25 percent of the
mothers questioned said they had received free samples of infant
formula milk, or literature promoting the benefits of formula milk
over breast milk.
</P>
<P>
The report named 32 companies, including multinationals Gerber,
Wyeth, Nestle and Mead Johnson, as violating the international
code for the marketing of breast milk substitutes.
</P>
<P>
"The companies have a moral obligation to abide by the code,
but instead they have treated it like something they can ignore
with impunity until they are caught," said the report.
</P>
<P>
To support the government's policy of encouraging
breast-feeding, formula milk producers in Thailand agreed last
year to refrain from advertising their products for use by infants
younger than six months old through the media and directly with
mothers.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Government Decides to Cut 1997 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government decided
this morning to cut 230 million U.S. dollars from the 1997 state
budget, the state-run Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The cut was approved after an all-night stormy cabinet debate
by a 12-4 vote.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, who was demanding an
additional 430 million dollars increase for 1998 defense spending,
boycotted the special cabinet meeting to protest the 59 million
dollars cuts in his ministry.
</P>
<P>
The cut, proposed by Finance Minister Ya'acov Neeman and
supported by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is necessary
because of an economic slowdown which has diminished the
government's tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Zevulun Hammer, Transport Minister Yitzhak
Levy and Health Minister Yehoshua Matza also voted against the
decision.
</P>
<P>
Of the 230 million dollars cut proposal, 171 million dollars
are specifically targeted at reducing the government's burgeoning
budget deficit. It is aimed at reducing the domestic budget
deficit to 2.2 percent of the gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
In so doing, the government will be able to meet its
2.8-billion-dollar budget deficit target, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The original planned budget for 1997 stands at 188 billion
shekel (54 billion dollars).

<P>
PARIS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The humanitarian group Medecins du Monde has warned the
French government against an alarmingly high rate of illness of
children caused by lead poisoning from old painting in running
down houses inhabited by the immigrants and the poor, especially
in Paris.
</P>
<P>
-- Volunteers, fire-fighters and soldiers are desperately
fighting to contain the ever-rising water level of the Oder River
dividing Germany and Poland. In Frankfurt-upon-Oder, the major
German city along the river, the water level has passed the
critical point of 6.3 meters and is rising at a rhythm of one
centimeter an hour, while the dike is subjected to a tremendous
pressure from the water.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The decision by the French government to seek corporate and
profit taxes from firms earning more than 50 million francs (10
million U.S. dollars) has aroused criticism from the country's big
and small entrepreneurs, who said that the measure will greatly
hit the medium-sized enterprises which are just beginning to
perform well, sabotage investment plans and undermine employment.
</P>
<P>
-- The United States President Bill Clinton Tuesday warned the
European Union against a trans-Atlantic trade war, after Brussels
refused to accept the merger between the Boeing and the
McDonnell-Douglas. The European Union has urged the U.S. aviation
giant to renounces its exclusive 20-year contract with three major
American airline companies on plane purchases.

<HEADLINE> Increasing Demand for Home Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Expanded housing reform has
prompted an ever increasing number of Chinese citizens in the
northern port city of Tianjin to seek home loans.
</P>
<P>
Statistics for the first six months of this year show that
2,139 people applied for mortgages valued at 85.4 million yuan
(about US$10 million), with respective figures representing 226
percent and 392 percent increases on last year's same period. The
average term of loan has been increased from five years in 1996 to
the current 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute the surging number of loan applicants to the
recent cut in interest rates for mortgage loans, with March rates
falling dramatically from 6.66 percent to 4.91 percent.
</P>
<P>
In April, the Tianjin municipal government also issued a
regulation simplifying procedures for borrowing money from
banks and extending loan terms.
</P>
<P>
The number of loan applications has grown on a monthly basis
since adoption of the aforementioned measures.
</P>
<P>
According to one city official, the availability of mortgage
loans has not only bolstered the capacity of local residents to
purchase new homes, but has also accelerated the commercialization
of housing in Tianjin.

</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference on Tuesday, Dumiso Dabengwa said
the ban would be effective for the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The ban, he said, was prompted by the spate demonstrations and
strikes that had become the order of the day in the country for
the past three weeks.
</P>
<P>
Most of the demonstrations were related to the on-going
collective bargaining process save for the one staged by
liberation war veterans who had seen ex-combatants picketing
ruling ZANU (PF) offices, the president's residence and
interrupting the African African-American (AAA) summit currently
underway here.
</P>
<P>
''The country has been hit by a wave of demonstrations and
unlawful gatherings which have interrupted essential services and
at times becoming a detriment, especially the city roads,'' the

''With the powers vested in me i was left with no choice but
to ban all such activities that disturb the smooth floor of
traffic in order to ensure that law and order is maintained in
the country,'' he pointed out.

be dealt with accordingly with the law''.

<HEADLINE> Herdsmen Turn To Farming In Northwest China's Pastures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Instead of tending his flock of
sheep in the Xinjiang mountain valley as usual this summer,
33-year-old Dawulati is cutting down clover in front of his home
in the flatlands.
</P>
<P>
The Kazak herdsman is still not too adept with the sickle, but
he is proud of being an owner of a 13-ha farm on which he plants
wheat, corn, and clover. There are some sheds and a new house with
glass windows at the back, bounded on three sides by lush greenery.
</P>
<P>
Dawulati's is one of 5,000 households that have settled down in
the plains of Xinyuan County of China's westernmost Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region. His wife tends their sheep in the mountain
valley, 30 km away, where the family has a contract on some 33 ha
of pasture land.
</P>
<P>
The region began a herdsmen settlement program in the middle of
the 1980s with the help of the World Food Program to help the
nomadic ethnic group settle down and end the centuries-old
practice of moving from one place to another in search of water
and grass. But, the fat livestock got skinny during the annual
moves, something that hindered the social and economic development
of the grassland areas.
</P>
<P>
There are now nearly 100,000 households, three-quarters of the
total number of herdsmen, that have settled on the flatlands.
Local governments have helped them build houses, roads, and
cultural, education, and public health facilities, dig wells,
erect power lines, and establish a production system.
</P>
<P>
"We relied heavily on weather before, but now things are
different. So long as we work hard in summer, our sheep will get
fatter in winter," says Dawulati.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the county was hit by a major snowstorm for the
third time this century, but the death rate among the livestock
was only 0.4 percent, whereas the two previous storms had killed
60 and 38 percent of the animals, respectively, said Rozahun,
deputy magistrate of the county.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, one-fifth of the county's herdsmen had less than 380
yuan in per capita income, but by the end of last year, 95 percent
of them earned more than 1,200 yuan, the official noted.
</P>
<P>
Dawulati's 12-year-old daughter had to attend a boarding school
before, but now she goes only 300 meters to class, and can watch
TV after she does her homework. The mountain valley is also a good
place for her to spend her summer holidays.

HOHHOT, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Some 15 housing projects, costing
400 million yuan (about 50 million US dollars), are under
construction in this capital city of north China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhao Guanghua, deputy mayor of Hohhot, the city
has invested 2.87 billion yuan (about 346 million US dollars) in
102 infrastructure projects over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Hohhot, meaning "green city" in the Mongolian language, lies
669 km west of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
However, it was a backward town until the middle of this century.
</P>
<P>
"There was no electricity here in the 1950s. The roads were full
of bumps and hollows, and the whole city was covered in dirt,"
said Wang Peizhen, a 72-year-old architect.
</P>
<P>
Wang recalled that in 1950 Hohhot covered an area of ten sq km,
and had a population of only 100,000. Except for a few two-story
buildings, most of the houses were low and shabby, built at the
beginning of this century. Industry consisted of a few small flour
mills, breweries and brickyards.
</P>
<P>
"However, when you take a stroll on the streets of Hohhot today
you will find none of the old houses, except some cultural relics
protected by the government," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
What will catch your eye are a 2,600-m-long four-story
overpass which is able to handle 17,000 motors an hour, the
largest horse-racing course in Asia and a new library covering an
area of 20,000 sq m., he added.
</P>
<P>
Amid these modern structures are trees and lawns, making the
city true to its name of "green city". Each resident enjoys a
green area of three sq m, with 27 percent of the city area covered
by trees and other plants.

<HEADLINE> Decline of Coffee Production in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 23 (Xinhua) -- A decline of coffee production in
Africa would not be reversed in the near future due to diseases
and civil wars in the continent, according to a Kenya Times
report today.
</P>
<P>
Arega Worku, Secretary-General of the Inter-African Coffee
Organization (IACO), was quoted as saying on Tuesday that "the
quantitative decline in African coffee has been evident for some
time."
</P>
<P>
He told the on-going 17th International Conference on Coffee
Science here that there was also a fall in coffee quality caused
by use of outdated farming practices and aggravated by lack of
sustained research.
</P>
<P>
Africa's major problems facing the coffee industry remain
inadequate funding and lack of qualified research personnel,
Worku noted at the meeting attended by about 200 delegates from
40 consumer and producer countries.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that "less than five countries out of the 25
comprising the organization have an appropriate research
institute with qualified staff."
</P>
<P>
Civil strife has affected production in Rwanda, Burundi and
the Democratic Republic of Congo (former Zaire), and refugees in
Tanzania have reduced land available for coffee expansion.
</P>
<P>
The IACO official noted that careless liberalization also
induced a decline in coffee quality and those countries in which
government still held a huge stake in the industry saw stable
quality control.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it is learned at the meeting which is discussing
coffee technologies that coffee consumption in all importing
countries had increased by 1.4 percent annually over the past 30
years from 50 million bags to 80 million bags (60 kg per bag).
</P>
<P>
Executive Director of the International Coffee Organization C.
Lodder predicted at the meeting that the improved economies of
central and eastern Europe, and other countries in Europe, Latin
America and Far East would lead to greater coffee sales.

WASHINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Magdalena Magdalena Maleeva of
Bulgaria took the first rounder against her Canadian opponent at
the Bank of the West Classic tennis tournament on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the 22-year-old woman only found herself in a trap as she
would next take on top-ranked Martina Hingis.
</P>

Maleeva, who turned professional at the age of 14, routed Jana
Nejedly 6-0, 6-3 in a rather swift manner by surrendering merely
three points.
</P>
<P>
Maleeva who ranked sixth in 1995, was the youngest sister of a
tennis family with six career titles to her credit. She was
almost absent from the court last year and was dropped to 40th in
the current rankings.
</P>
<P>
In other action of the day, sixth seed Conchita Martinez of
Spain breezed into the second round with an easy win of 6-3, 6-2
over Siobhan Drake Brockman of Australia.
</P>
<P>
Martinez, currently ranked 11th, her lowest since 1990, was yet
to reap her first tournament of the year to enlarge her pool of 28
career titles.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Tightens Control of Cash Flow of Foreign Currencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has managed to tighten the
control of cash flow of foreign currencies to avoid a situation in
which U.S. dollars are being taken out of the country without
official approval.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest issue of the Vietnam Investment Review,
foreign-funded companies have been ordered by the State Bank of
Vietnam (SBV) to conduct all their capital dealings through
foreign currency bank accounts in a crackdown on illegal profit
withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
The move was aimed at stopping firms from holding onto profits
and taking them out of the country without putting them through a
bank account, SBV officials were quoted by the review as saying.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the bank's measure will impose tougher rules on
the operation of some foreign-funded companies operating in
Vietnam, stopping them from processing foreign money illegally.
</P>
<P>
Despite increasing hard currency shortages, a total of 84
million U.S. dollars left Vietnam in the first six months of this
year, said the General Department of Customs.

<HEADLINE> Half of Babies Born Underweight in Bangladesh: UN Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- About fifty percent of Bangladesh's
newborn babies are found underweight compared to some 20 percent
in other developing countries, according to a report released by
the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
More than three million babies are born in Bangladesh every
year -- six babies are born every minute -- while one in two
babies weighs less than 2.5 kg, the standard weight for a healthy
baby, said the report published here today.
</P>
<P>
Babies are born underweight mainly because their mothers have
been suffering from malnutrition, said the report, adding that
children born underweight face increased risks of loss of power to
move, heart attack, brain hemorrhage, blindness, deafness and
mental retardation.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that the problem of stunting growth (low
height) is an indicator of long-term "chronic" malnutrition caused
by insufficient or poor quality of food, poor feeding patterns,
frequent disease infection and poverty.
</P>
<P>
Stunting weakens the immune system, impairs the learning
capacity and work performance and affects the overall quality of
life, the report added.

<HEADLINE> More Babies Born Underweight In Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The incidence of low birth-weight
babies is increasing in Sri Lanka, the United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) said in its latest report.
</P>
<P>
The report said Sri Lanka has failed to make the grade in the
field of nutrition and it ranked high among countries in most
indicators evaluating human development.
</P>
<P>
The report ranks Sri Lanka as one of the four countries in the
world with the highest rate of underweight babies. The other
countries are Bangladesh, India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The incidence of low birth-weight babies (below 2.5 kg) in Sri
Lanka now stands at 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
At least 20 percent of Sri Lankan children are stunted and 13
percent are wasted mainly due to the malnutrition of the mothers,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said 94 percent of the babies in Sri Lanka
are delivered in hospitals, compared with 26 percent in India, 13
percent in Pakistan and five percent in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Over 335,000 babies are reportedly born every year in Sri
Lanka.

<HEADLINE> Pollution Troubles Thai Industrial Zone Expansion Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Thai environmental officials have
advised against further expansion of an industrial estate in east
Thailand for fear that more industrial emissions would make the
severe pollution there even worse.
</P>
<P>
The growth of Mab Ta Phut industrial estate should be
determined by whether the atmosphere in the area could absorb more
toxic discharge safely without posing a risk to the residents
there, said Apichart Anukularphai, an expert at the Office of
Environmental Policy and Planning, Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the air around Mab Ta Phut industrial estate,
Rayong province, some 180 kilometers southeast of the capital
Bangkok, had reached saturation point.
</P>
<P>
The severe air pollution in the industrial area has recently
drawn protests from residents and had forced a school to move to a
safer area.
</P>
<P>
Lignite-fueled power plants at the estate are releasing too
much harmful waste gases and chemical liquids, said Supat
Wangwongwatana, an official at the Pollution Control Department.
</P>
<P>
The official called for an urgent study to determine the level
of pollutants in the atmosphere so that measures could be worked
out to deal with factories responsible for toxic emissions in the
industrial estate.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Fails to Meet IMF's Conditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Conceding that Ukraine is unlikely to
qualify this year for 2.5 billion U.S. dollars of International
Monetary Fund (IMF) loan, Ukrainian officials have shifted their
hopes to a smaller stand-by credit needed to cover the country's
budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
"We have not managed to meet seven or eight conditions of the
IMF," Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Tigipko said at a recent
briefing. "But we have done more than enough to receive a stand-by
loan," he added.
</P>
<P>
Among the conditions Ukraine has failed to meet are those
requiring the population to fully cover the cost of housing and
utilities, tax reforms needed to reverse the economy's slide and a
new law granting full independence to the central bank, the
National Bank of Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Some Ukrainian officials claimed that the IMF was tougher on
Ukraine than on other countries seeking its loans.
</P>
<P>
Anatoly Halchynsky, economic advisor to Ukrainian President
Leonid Kuchma, brought up the case on July 9 when he met an
American delegation headed by White House aide Richard Morningstar.
</P>
<P>
In particular, Halchynsky noted that Ukrainians pay 80
percent of the cost of utilities and Russian citizens only pay 27
percent.
</P>
<P>
Despite that gap, Russia "still gets financial aid from
international organizations," Halchynsky said.
</P>
<P>
The stand-by loan Ukraine hopes to get from the IMF could
total as much as 750 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Tigipko said IMF is expected to make the final decision by July
when the IMF mission comes back from consultations in Washington.
</P>
<P>
However, Tigipko said the economy and finance ministries will
continue seeking the larger three-year, 2.5 billion-dollar
loan.
</P>
<P>
It is still conceivable that the larger loan may be approved
this year, he added.

MOSCOW, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Russia is ready to take an active

Gennady Tarasov said here today.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the sweeping reform plan announced by
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan last Thursday, Tarasov said the
success of U.N. reforms depend on the extent to which the body

</P>
<P>
He warned that unless all member states recognized their
international obligations, U.N. reform would get nowhere.
</P>
<P>
Russia approved many proposals put forward by Annan, and
suggested the U.N. pay more attention to peace-keeping, social and
economic development and fighting international crime.
</P>
<P>
Annan's U.N. reform plan proposes the most sweeping
organizational changes in U.N. history, vowing to streamline the
bureaucracy, reduce staff and cut budgets.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Company Drilling for Oil, Gas in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Texaco Exploration Myanmar Inc.
of the United State has started drilling for oil and natural gas
off the Myanmar coast after carrying out a seismic survey with the
state-run Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE).
</P>
<P>
The drilling is being conducted at Aunglaba Test Well of Block
M-12 off the Tanintharyi coast, one of the blocks where Yetagun
Gas Field was designated, local newspaper The New Light of Myanmar
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Drilling will reach 4,290 meters in depth, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Natural gas from the Yetagun Field, which has been jointly
developed by the PTTEP (Thailand), Texaco (U.S.), Premier
(Britain), Nippon (Japan) and MOGE (Myanmar), will be exported to
Thailand beginning 1999, according to a contract signed in March
between the Petroleum Authority of Thailand and the developers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, under a production sharing contract with the MOGE,
the Atlantic Richfield Oil Co. (ARCO), another U.S. company, has
been drilling for oil and natural gas at two test wells -- the
Shwepyihtay and the Shwepyiaye of Block M-9 off the Mottama coast.
The Shwepyihtay well has been yielding gas on a commercial scale
since March.
</P>
<P>
Altogether six U.S. companies are involved in oil and gas
exploration in Myanmar -- International/Santa FE, Apache, Texaco
Inc., UNOCAL, ARCO and Baker Hughes.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, Myanmar has signed over 20
production sharing contracts with oil companies from Australia,
Britain, France, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Thailand and the
United States to explore oil and natural gas in seven onshore and
five offshore areas in the country.
</P>
<P>
The latest official statistics show that foreign investment in
Myanmar's oil and gas sector had exceeded 2.13 billion U.S.
dollars in 34 permitted projects by the end of May this year.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in Myanmar totaled more than six billion
U.S. dollars, of which 582.07 million came from the U.S., the
fourth largest foreign investor in the country.

<HEADLINE> Italian Court Reduces Penalty for 2 Nazi War Criminals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 22 (Xinhua) -- An Italian military court today
reduced the penalty for two former Nazi SS officers involved in a
massacre near Rome in 1944, keeping one in jail for six months and
releasing the other.
</P>
<P>
The judges convicted both Erich Priebke and Karl Hass for their
roles in the March 1944 Ardeatine Caves massacre in which SS
soldiers rounded up and shot 335 Italian nationals in retaliation
for an attack on German occupation forces.
</P>
<P>
Both Priebke, 83, and Hass, 84, admitted shooting two victims
each. Priebke also said that he ticked names off a list as victims
arrived at the caves.
</P>
<P>
Both war criminals could have faced life imprisonment, which
was requested by the Italian public, the relatives of the victims
in particular.
</P>
<P>
However, the judges reduced the sentence to 15 years for
Priebke and 10 years and eight months for Hass by granting some
mitigating circumstances, especially the elapse of more than 50
years since the crimes were committed.
</P>
<P>
Then further concessions were granted to cut the sentences to
five years for Priebke and eight months for Hass.
</P>
<P>
Then, Priebke had only six months and 15 days left to serve
after discounting the time spent in jail pending and during the
hearings. Hass will not serve any time because he has been held
under house arrest since he was indicted in the case last November.
</P>
<P>
The verdict triggered intense public responses. The Jewish
society in Italy regretted the verdict and strongly criticized the
court for considering Priebke and Hass as ordinary criminals.
</P>
<P>
The relatives of the victims in the massacre expressed their
strong dissatisfaction over the verdict, calling it "ridiculous."

<HEADLINE> ADB: Indonesia's Foreign Debt Level Not a Concern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
has said it was not concerned about Indonesia's foreign debt but
urged the country to maintain sound macroeconomic management.
</P>
<P>
ADB President Mitsuo Sato said here Tuesday after meeting with
Indonesian President Soeharto that Indonesia's foreign debt level
was not yet a concern and that the bank would continue to provide
assistance to the country.
</P>
<P>
But Sato urged Indonesia to increase its domestic savings level
to reduce its dependence on foreign funds and finance its
development.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's overall foreign debt stands at more than 110
billion U.S. dollars, half of which is owned by the public sector.
</P>
<P>
Sato said the ADB had extended 13.3 billion dollars in loans
for 217 projects and 123.2 million dollars in grants for 325
technical assistance projects in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia accounts for more than 20 percent of the bank's total
loan approvals to date, he added.
</P>
<P>
Sato, who is on a visit here since Monday, said the central
theme facing this country in years to come was how to use
resources more efficiently, including capital resources, human
resources and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
"In this context, I stressed the need for further development
of the financial sector, especially the long-term capital market,"
Sato said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's economic growth of 6.6 percent per annum between
1967 ad 1995 was among the highest in the world and a commendable
one, Sato said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that this structural transformation which is ongoing
in favor of urbanization and skill-intensive, value-added
activities should provide the basis for continued socio-economic
progress into the 21st century," he added.

<HEADLINE> China's Economy In First Half of 1997 (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- China's economy recorded rapid but
rational growth during the first half of this year, with a GDP of
3.3 trillion yuan, up 9.5 percent over the same period in 1996 in
real terms, according to the State Statistics Bureau (SSB)
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference yesterday he said that during the
January-June period, primary industries, which include crop
cultivation, fisheries, and animal husbandry, had a year-on-year
increase of five percent, while in secondary and tertiary
industries it was 11.1 percent and 9.3 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
China had a good summer grain harvest this year, with an
estimated 124 million tons, up 10.75 million tons from last year.
</P>
<P>
The country's industries at and above the township level had
984.9 billion yuan in added value, and state enterprises had a 7.2
percent increase, the collective sector, 12.5 percent, and other
sectors, 15.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Profits were up 35.8 percent, according to the SSB.
</P>
<P>
The country spent 741.7 billion yuan on fixed assets, up 13.5
percent, 5.1 percentage points lower than 1996's increase.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of the year, retail sales jumped to 1.3
trillion yuan, a 12.1 percent increase when adjusted for
inflation. Retail sales were up 12.8 percent in urban areas, and a
bit lower in the countryside, at 11 percent.

The SSB says that increased sales of large-screen color TVs,
VCD players, and air-conditioners contributed to the present boom
in sales in China.
</P>
<P>
Exports amounted to 80.8 billion US dollars in the January-June
period, up 26.2 percent, while imports fell 0.1 percent, to 63
billion dollars. The foreign trade surplus was 17.8 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The country used 18.5 billion dollars in foreign investment
during the period, up 1.5 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
State foreign currency reserves had stable growth since the
start of the year, amounting to 120.9 billion dollars by the end
of June.
</P>
<P>
Retail prices increased 1.8 percent from last year, while the
consumer price index went up 4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in price increases was attributed to two
things: several consecutive good harvests in recent years, and
increasing supplies of industrial products for the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
According to the SSB, urban incomes were 2,680 yuan per capita
in the January-June period, a year-on-year increase of 2.2
percent. Farmer incomes were 980 yuan per capita, an increase of
3.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Although the economy had steady growth as a whole, there is
still a "structural imbalance" and some enterprises are still
running at a loss, while the number of jobless people grew in some
parts of the country, so a greater effort is needed in enterprise
reforms to improve operations.

been waging a 14-year war for a separate state in the north and
east of Sri Lanka.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Increase Defense Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia plans to increase the
military personnel and defense budget over the next two years,
according to the country's new defense and security policies.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement outlining Indonesia's new defense and
security policies, Defense and Security Minister Edi Sudradjat
said Tuesday that the total number of Indonesian Armed Forces
(ABRI) personnel will be increased to 505,000 by the end of the
Sixth Five-year Development Plan in 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, ABRI's largest force will be the
police with 192,000 members, while the army personnel will rise to
243,000 from the current 235,237, the navy will grow to 47,000
members and the air force will be expanded to 23,000.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said the government will mobilize citizens
for public security and order. A bill on mass mobilization,
submitted by the Defense Ministry, is currently being deliberated
at the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
The nation's defense budget in 1996 was 2.3 billion U.S.
dollars, an equivalent of 1.8 percent of the country's gross
domestic product (GDP), and Sudradjat said that could hopefully be
raised to between 2 and 3 percent of the GDP in the future.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's defense budget last year was "the smallest among
Southeast Asian countries and other neighbors", the minister said.

<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Public Health Minister Chen
Minzhang has urged government officials at all levels to step up
disaster relief efforts and put top priority on epidemic
prevention, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a national tele-conference yesterday in Beijing,
Chen said natural disasters -- earthquakes, floods and drought,
which hit the country since early this year -- may give rise to
the spread of hepatitis, typhoid and dysentery.
</P>
<P>
Drought in the north is not over yet, while the southern
provinces have entered the typhoon season that makes disaster
rescue and disease prevention an arduous task, he stressed, adding
that local governments must be constantly prepared to cope with a
possible eruption of more disasters and diseases.
</P>
<P>
Deteriorating environmental and living conditions in flooded
and drought-hit areas are posing a severe threat to the health of
local residents. Food and water-transmitted intestinal epidemics
might happen at any time, said the health minister.
</P>
<P>
The ecological environment has also been damaged and the
density of flies, mosquitoes and rats has been increasing.
</P>
<P>
People in disaster-hit districts live in makeshift shelters or
in the open, increasing their chances of contact with epidemic
diseases.
</P>
<P>
Chen asked local health departments to make timely reports of
epidemic situations to the central government and tighten up
inspection over the implementation of State laws on epidemic
disease control and food hygiene.

<HEADLINE> Steel Production Up in First Half Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Iron and steel production showed a
fine growing momentum with the output of major products enjoying
big increases in the first half of the year, today's "China Daily"
reports.
</P>
<P>
China produced 52.5 million tons of steel and 46.86 million
tons of rolled steel during the January-June period, an increase
of 6.7 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
A report from the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry attributed
the achievement to the tapping of production potential of
metallurgical enterprises, expanding market demand, and fair costs
of coal, electricity and transportation as well as global economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
Customs statistics indicate that exports of steel products
increased and imports decreased, showing a healthy trend in the
foreign trade within the industry.
</P>
<P>
Among the exports, 2.56 million tons, or 83.7 percent of the
total, were products processed with imported raw materials. The
figure represents an increase of 790,000 tons, or ten percent,
over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The exports of products processed with imported materials have
helped enterprises reduce export costs and ease enterprises' fund
shortage, the paper says.

JAKARTA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas said here today that Cambodia's First Prime Minister Prince
Norodom Ranariddh has expressed his willingness to visit Jakarta
to discuss his country's situation.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said Indonesia is making preparations to greet Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
The visit of Ranariddh to Indonesia will be part of his current
visit to several ASEAN countries, which has taken to Thailand, the
Philippines and Singapore, Alatas said.
</P>
<P>
From Singapore, the prince will travel to Kuala Lumpur to meet
Malaysian leaders, the Indonesian foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
Asked on the strong reaction of Cambodia's Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen on the delay of Cambodia's membership in ASEAN,
Alatas said he understands Hun Sen's stance. "There was just an
armed conflict in Cambodia," he added.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Ranariddh and Hun Sen were recently involved in
armed conflicts because of the differences of the two Cambodian
leaders.

Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand
and Vietnam, will accept Laos and Myanmar as its members at a
meeting on July 24-25.

<HEADLINE> Former Agent Says CIA Ordered Che Guevara's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) ordered the death of guerrilla fighter Ernesto "Che"
Guevara due to his enormous influence over his colleagues across
Latin America, said a former CIA agent here today.
</P>
<P>
"Che Guevara was the CIA's biggest nightmare because he had the
charisma and the capacity to direct the battle against the
political repression of the traditional hierarchies who had power
in Latin American countries," said former CIA agent Phillip Agee.
</P>
<P>
The 62 year-old former agent is currently in Cuba at the
invitation of the Cuban Committee For Peace and the People's
Sovereignty to the 14th World Youth and Student Festival to be
held from July 28 to August 5 on this island nation.
</P>
<P>
The CIA's number one job at the time, Agee acknowledged, was to
collect information from its Latin American bases about the
activities prepared by Che Guevara.
</P>
<P>
The former U.S. agent said he will take advantage of his
attendance at the festival to denounce what he described as the
Washington's plans to destroy the Cuban revolution.
</P>
<P>
Che Guevara, an Argentine national, was the comrade in arms of
Cuban President Fidel Castro during the Cuban revolution. He was
killed in 1967 in Bolivia together with other Cuban and local
guerrilla fighters. His remains were removed early this month from
a mass grave in Bolivia and taken to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Agee said he worked for 11 years, between 1957 and 1968, in CIA
operations in Latin America and was assigned to Ecuador, Uruguay
and Mexico.

<HEADLINE> AC Milan to Erase Depressing Memories of Defeats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Kicked out of the European Cup, AC
Milan returns to the soccer ground this week, aiming to wipe out
the memory of one of its most depressing seasons in club history.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 champion would play a friendly Thursday night against
its satellite club, second division Monza, trying to erase all
shadows of last season's all-too-frequent defeats.
</P>
<P>
In 13 months, Milan has given the axes to both Oscar Tabarez
and Arrigo Sacchi after the former powerhourse finished mid-table
in the Serie A last season and was circled out of the European
Football Cup in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
Fabio Capello, who guided the club to four league titles in
five years before winning the Spanish league with Real Madrid last
season, backed to take the helm of the Milan club and was
convinced they can retain the top spot in the Serie A.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Milan has had a spending spree of 30 million
dollars to strengthen every department, bringing in Ajax's Patrick
Kluivert and Gothenberg's Andreas Andersson to replace veterans
Roberto Baggio and Marco Simone in attack.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the club also signed in two new midfielders from
Italian Cup winners Vicenza and France's Ibrahim Ba.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the biggest change is in the defence as Franco Baresi
retired after his 20-year run in the pitch, posing a tough
challenge for both Capello and the club members in their bid for
resurrection.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica Overcoming Economic Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica's economy is coming
out from a crisis and back onto a slow growth path, Finance
Minister Francisco de Paula Gutierrez said today.
</P>
<P>
The economy is emerging from a difficult two-year period of
adjustment, Paula Gutierrez said, noting it was the shortage of
external funds that prompted Costa Rica to curb demand.
</P>
<P>
"The reduction in overseas investments, in part a consequence
of the 1994 Mexican crisis, forced us to adapt the demand in our
economy to the country's ability to pay," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica's gross domestic product (GDP) dropped 0.7 percent
last year and its unemployment increased to 6.2 percent "but we
made important progress in the stabilization process," he said.
</P>
<P>
Inflation was down from 22.5 percent in 1995 to 13.9 percent in
1996, interest rates fell and the exchange rate remained
relatively stable, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Now, Paula Gutierrez said, those trends are changing,
production is increasing although at a very slow rate of around
1.3 percent during the first few months of this year.
</P>
<P>
"These indicators reveal an economy that is emerging from the
adjustment process, at a slow, but solid rate," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The external perception of Costa Rica is changing, several big
companies have decided to invest in the country and we are seeing
the entry of short-term capital which requires our attention."
</P>
<P>
But problems in Costa Rica's economy go beyond the aspects of
this juncture in time, in the minister's opinion.
</P>
<P>
"What we have before us is the enormous challenge of continuing
to adopt decisions that will break through structural
limitations," he acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez proposed that the economic growth in the country is
based on private sector activities and the opening up of trade.
</P>
<P>
As long as there are fiscal disparities, it will be difficult
to promote the investment of Costa Rican capital. "The government
must keep its spending under control," said Paula Gutierrez.
</P>
<P>
The senior government official suggested that the public sector
debt be paid off via privatization programs, an issue that has met
with opposition from broad spectrum of the sector.
</P>
<P>
He proposed the adoption of a fiscal reform that would
guarantee new financial resources for the treasury and to face the
challenge of rebuilding the country's infrastructure.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Pulls out of Nations Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone has pulled out of its
remaining two matches in the African Nations Cup due to financial
difficulties caused by the relocation of the matches.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone had been scheduled to play against Tunisia on July
23 and against Guinea on July 27, both in Freetown, the Sierra
Leone capital.
</P>
<P>
But the Confederation of African Football (CAF) has now decided
that the matches be moved to Bamako, the capital of Mali.
</P>
<P>
It is understood that the decision is related with the domestic
situation in Sierra Leone after the May 25 coup that led to the
military government of Major Johnny Koromah and the intervention
of Nigeria-led West African peace-keeping forces.
</P>
<P>
Umaru Deen-Sesay, secretary of sports of the new government,
protested against the decision on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We have assured CAF of the safety of Tunisian and Guinean
players while in Freetown but this has not been heeded," he said
over the state radio.
</P>
<P>
Deen-Sesay argued that Sierra Leone once honoured a world cup
qualifying match against Burundi in Bujumbura even there was an
upheaval in that country.
</P>
<P>
Now that the matches had been moved to Bamako, Sierra Leone
would need 180,000 U.S. dollars to host them.
</P>
<P>
"Under the current situation, we are left with no alternative but
to quit the matches," Deen-Sasey said.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Baseball Players, Coaches Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Cuban sports authorities suspended
four players and three coaches from its baseball teams after they
applied for emmigration to play as professionals abroad.
</P>
<P>
Player Jorge Luis Toca Gomez and Coaches Orlando Chinea Valdes,
Pedro Jova Perez and Luis Gonzales were suspended definitely from
playing baseball in Cuba, announced the Cuban National Institute
of Sports and Recreation (INDER, its acronym in Spanish) in a
press bulletin published on Tuesday by the "Granma" (Official
Gazette).
</P>
<P>
Temporary suspensions were handed down for baseball players
Eduardo Paret Perez, Osmany Garcia Santana and Angel Lopez
Berrios, he added.
</P>
<P>
Cuban sports authorities cancelled a friendly game for the
national baseball team in Miami, Florida not long ago on the
argument that it had information that members of the team were
going to be the object of hostility on the part of those opposed
to the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
Sports is one of the revolution's conquests and requires
exemplary behavior from each athlete, coach or official, the Inder
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions against the players and coaches were meted out
according to the seriousness of their deeds, it pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Toca Gomez applied to leave the country to become a
professional baseball player, the note explained.
</P>
<P>
The Inder pointed out that Cuban athletes must defend their
flag and the sacred name of their mother country.
</P>
<P>
Baseball is one of the most important sports in Cuba.

CANBERRA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Australian
</P>
<P>
-- Australia should use special financial incentives to entice
overseas firms to set up in Australia rather than in Asia's tiger
economies, the federal government will be told today.
</P>
<P>
-- Papua New Guinea's ruling coalition was decided yesterday by
a parliamentary vote that installed Bill Skate as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>
-- The federal government has been urged to adopt a
go-for-growth approach to running the economy, with an influential
report discussed in cabinet yesterday recommending a formal
economic growth target of 4 percent or more a year.
</P>
<P>
The Age
</P>
<P>
-- Leaders of South Pacific nations have indicated that they
will confront the Australian prime minister over an Australian
secret report, which accused leaders of several Pacific island
country leaders of being drunks and corrupt and some countries of
being close to economic collapse.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review
</P>
<P>
-- Australia is renewing its push for improved access to the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations Free Trade Area (AFTA), a
market worth 444 billion U.S. dollars. The new bid for a formal
link with AFTA coincides with increasing alarm within the
Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade that Australian companies
are moving offshore to gain low-tariff access to Southeast Asia's
market of 340 million people.

<P>
SARAJEVO, July 22 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian soldier serving with
the NATO-led Stabilization Force (SPOR) was killed just one week
after his arrival in Bosnia, the SPOR reported today.
</P>
<P>
An SPOR statement said that Bombardier Robert Daniel Vialette
was found shot dead in his living quarters after fellow soldiers
heard a loud noise.
</P>
<P>
Vialette, who arrived in Bosnia on July 16, was serving with a
Canadian artillery unit based in the northern Bosnian town of
Coralici.
</P>
<P>
"His death is being treated as an isolated incident and is not
related to any former warring faction activity," the statement
said, leading to speculations that the Canadian soldier committed
suicide.
</P>
<P>
Vialette was the latest of the 73 soldiers who have died since
the NATO-led peacekeeping force was deployed in Bosnia. Most of
deaths were caused by road accidents and self-inflicted gun shots.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Says Ronaldo Belongs to Inter Milan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Soccer's world governing body FIFA
on Tuesday authorized the transfer of Brazilian superstar Ronaldo
from FC Barcelona to Inter Milan.
</P>
<P>
The FIFA Players Status Committee said Ronaldo is free of any
contractual obligation to Barcelona after having validly bought
out his contract with the Spanish club.
</P>
<P>
FIFA said Ronaldo is free to join Inter Milan immediately while
the two clubs negotiate his transfer fee.
</P>
<P>
Barcelona had fought Ronaldo's move on grounds that a player
can not buy out his contract in order to obtain an international
transfer.
</P>
<P>
But FIFA ruled that the 27 million US dollars paid to Barcelona
was only for buying out the contract and was "not related to any
transfer fee."
</P>
<P>
FIFA said it was asking the two clubs to come to an agreement
on the transfer fee by July 31.
</P>
<P>
"If no agreement is reached by that date, FIFA will impose a
fee, which shall be binding," it said.
</P>
<P>
"Pending the final decision on the transfer fee, FIFA is
authorizing the Italian Football Federation to register Ronaldo
provisionally and with immediate effect, with Inter Milan."
</P>
<P>
The ruling means Ronaldo is eligible to make his debut for the
Italian club in an exhibition game Sunday against Manchester
United at the San Siro stadium in Milan.

<HEADLINE> Annan Proposes New UN Force in Haiti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Kofi
Annan today recommended establishment of a new U.N. military and
police force in Haiti with fewer persons after the mandate of the
existing UN mission there expires on July 31.
</P>
<P>
In his latest report to the Security Council, he proposed a
four-month mandate, until November 30, for the new U.N. operation
to be known as the United Nations Transition Mission in Haiti. The
present U.N. police strength of 300 would be reduced to 250 and
the U.N. troop strength of 500 reduced to a military headquarters
staff of 50, he said.
</P>
<P>
The mandate of the new mission would be to support the Haitian
autorities in the further professionalization of the Haitian
National Police, he said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general noted that Haiti had taken significant
strides forward thanks to the support of the international
community. But, he said, "Haiti continues to face daunting
political and economic challenges."
</P>
<P>
In the short term, a new cabinet must be formed and the
electoral crisis overcome to allow parliament and local assemblies
to function effectively. Reforms needed to strengthen democratic
institutions, generate economic growth and create jobs would
require a basic consensus among Haitians that had yet to be built,
he said.
</P>
<P>
In the long run, sustainable development would not be achieved
without significant international assistance, based on a widely
supported action plan.
</P>
<P>
He noted the UN military presence had a stabilizing effect on
Haiti, especially at this time when the country was experiencing
serious political turmoil.
</P>
<P>
"Ending the United Nations presence at this time might well
jeopardize the significant progress achieved by Haiti with the
assistance of the international community," he added.

<HEADLINE> Greece Reconsidering Policy Towards Illegal Immigrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Greek government could make
changes to provisions of the June presidential decrees which
excluded immigrants from countries bordering Greece from the right
to become registered and acquire legal status, Labor and Social
Security Minister Miltiades Papaioannou said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the two presidential decrees approved by the Greek
cabinet in late June, foreigners and illegal immigrants living and
working in Greece would be able to registered as of September 1,
but those from countries sharing borders with Greece were not
covered by the new legislation.
</P>
<P>
In effect, this exempted immigrants from Albania, Bulgaria,
Turkey and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Currently, some 450,000 illegal immigrants are living in
Greece.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ambassador Refutes Attempts to Split China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Ambassador Qin Huasun,
China's permanent representative to the UN, today sent a letter to
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, refuting attempts to split China
by Nicaragua and eight other countries.
</P>
<P>
On July 14, Nicaragua and eight other countries addressed a
letter to Kofi Annan in which they requested inscription on the
agenda of the coming 52nd session of the General Assembly of an
item of the so-called "necessity to review Resolution 2758 (XXVI)
of the General Assembly of the United Nations due to fundamental
change in the international situation and two governments
co-existing across the Taiwan Straits."
</P>
<P>
Qin said that the letter and its annexes of Nicaragua and eight
other countries "distort facts in a brazen attempt to make use of
the august organization of the United Nations to carry out plots
aimed at splitting a sovereign state and creating `two Chinas,'
`one China, one Taiwan' or `one country, two governments.'"
</P>
<P>
"This has not only seriously encroached upon China's
sovereignty and grossly interfered in its internal affairs, but
also willfully trampled upon the Purposes and Principles of the
United Nations Charter and Resolution 2758 (XXVI) of the General
Assembly, at which the Chinese government and people express their
utmost indignation and condemnation," Qin said in his letter.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and people are firmly opposed to any
such illegal activities against the spirit of the Charter by any
country or person under whatever pretext and strongly urge
Nicaragua and a very small number of other countries to redress
their erroneous acts immediately, he added.
</P>
<P>
As is known to all, Taiwan has been an inalienable part of
China since ancient times. To date, 159 countries have established
diplomatic relations with China. They all recognize that there is
but one China in the world, that the Government of the People's
Republic of China is the sole legal government representing China
in its entirety and that Taiwan is part of China, he said.
</P>
<P>
Though the two sides of the Taiwan Straits have been in a
temporary state of separation since October 1949, he said, the
status of Taiwan as part of the territory of the People's Republic
of China has never changed, nor has the Government of the People's
Republic of China ever given up its jurisdiction over Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"No change in Taiwan's social, economic and political situation
can change the fact that Taiwan is an inalienable part of the
Chinese territory, that Taiwan is a province of China and the
Taiwan authorities are a local authority of China.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Ambassador Qin Huasun
stressed that the restoration of the lawful rights of the People's
Republic of China and the expulsion of the Taiwan authorities from
the United Nations are two indivisible aspects of one question.
</P>
<P>
In his letter addressed to UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, he
reviewed the adoption of the historically significant Resolution
2758 (XXVI), which clearly and unequivocally "recognized that the
representatives of the Government of the People's Republic of
China are the only lawful representatives of China to the United
Nations and that the People's Republic of China is one of the five
permanent representatives of the Security Council" and decides to
restore all rights of the People's Republic of China in the United
Nations and expel the representatives of Taiwan from the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
"Without expelling the Taiwan authorities from the United
Nations, it would have been impossible to properly resolve China's
representation at the United Nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
The resolution has reaffirmed the "one China" principle, thus
settling once and for all and in a just manner the question of
China's representation at the United Nations. It not only foiled
the plot by a very small number of countries to create "two
Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" in the United Nations then, but
has also ruled out for good the possibility of such a plot
achieving its evil purpose. The resolution which has reflected the
Purposes and Principles of the Charter as well as the desire of an
overwhelming majority of countries of the United Nations is a
victory of justice, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, since 1993, Nicaragua and a very small number of other
member states, moving against the historical trend at the beck and
call of the Taiwan authorities, have gone so far as to challenge
Resolution 2758 (XXVI) and attempted to mislead the General
Assembly into considering the question of the so-called Taiwan's
"representation." The thrust of their proposal is to negate the
"one China" principle and strip Resolution 2758 (XXVI) of its
essence, so as to create "two Chinas," "one China, one Taiwan" or
"one country, two governments" by new tricks. "This is entirely a
mockery and blasphemy of such an august organization as the United
Nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
The General Committee of the successive session of the General
Assembly since the 48th session have all made a just reply to this
question, i.e. not including the question of the so-called Taiwan's
"representation" in the agenda of the General Assembly. This has
fully reflected the resolve of the overhelming majority of UN
member states to defend the principles of the UN Charter and their
strong will to safeguard the seriousness and integrity of
Resolution 2758 (XXVI). The new proposal dished out by Nicaragua
and a very small number of other countries this year will come to
an end certainly no better than previous years, he said.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Ambassador Qin Huasun said
that only national reunification is the fundamental guarantee of
the interests of the Taiwan compatriots.
</P>
<P>
"Only with the accomplishment of peaceful reunification can the
Taiwan compatriots truly and fully enjoy, together with other
Chinese people of all ethnic groups, the dignity and prestige
attained by their great motherland in the world," he said in his
letter today addressed to UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
There is no one in the world that is more concerned about the
interests and future of the 21.5 million Taiwan compatriots than
the Chinese government and people, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He reviewed development of China's policy of "peaceful
reunification and one country, two systems" which was put forward
by the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping over a decade ago for the
settlement of the Taiwan question.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's return to the motherland on July 1 this year marks
an important step toward the accomplishment of China's great cause
of national reunification and has won warm welcome from the entire
Chinese people including the 21.5 million Taiwan compatriots as
well as appreciation and endorsement from all countries in the
world. In December 1999, "one country, two systems" will be
implemented in Macao, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Facts will prove that the concept of `one country, two systems'
is not only a good way to settle the questions of Hong Kong and
Macao, but will also certainly succeed in Taiwan," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The ultimate realization of `one country, two systems' in
Taiwan conforms to the common aspirations and is in the
fundamental interest of the entire Chinese people including the
21.5 million Taiwan compatriots and contributes to peace and
stability in the Asia-Pacific region and the world as a whole," he
added.
</P>
<P>
In order to end the state of separation between the two sides
of the Taiwan Straits and achieve national reunification, Chinese
President Jiang Zemin made an important speech on January 30,
1995, in which he put forward an eight-point proposal on
developing the relations across the Straits and advancing the
process of peaceful reunification of the motherland, he reviewed.
</P>
<P>
The proposal has not only taken into consideration the
long-term interests of the entire Chinese people, but also
accommodated and safeguarded the vital interests of the Taiwan
compatriots, thus winning strong support from the entire Chinese
people including the Taiwan compatriots as well as wide acclaim
from the international community, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will adhere to the proposal and policies
for a long time to come to promote the development of relations
between the two sides of the Straits and create more favorable
conditions for peaceful reunification, he said.
</P>
<P>
"However, we have to point out with regret that instead of
making a goodwill response, the Taiwan authorities have continued
to carry out secessionist activities in the world aimed at
creating `two Chinas' and `one China, one Taiwan.' We hope that
the Taiwan authorities will, in the wider interest of the Chinese
nation, return to the one China position, stop all activities to
split the motherland and take concrete measures to improve the
relations across the straits," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that should Nicaragua and a very small number of
other countries continue to hurt the fundamental interests of
China, they would isolate themselves and ultimately pay the price
for it.

UNITED NATIONS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of the
United Nations today decided to establish the Dag Hammarskjold
Medal in recognition and commemoration of those who have lost
their lives in peacekeeping operations under the operational
control of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Council President Ambassador Peter Osvald of Sweden announced
the decision in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The medal is named after Dag Hammarskjold, the second
secretary-general of this organization, who greatly contributed to
the development of the concept of peacekeeping operations, whose
own commitment to the cause of peacekeeping was unwavering, and
who lost his life while on mission to one of the many countries in
which the United Nations has tried to build peace.
</P>
<P>
"Today, we express our gratitude to all those who have served
the United Nations in the cause of peace. Over 750,000 men and
women have served in UN peacekeeping operations. More than 1,500
have lost their lives; many more have been wounded," said the
president.
</P>
<P>
"As we honor those who have died in the United Nations
peacekeeping operations, we must never forget our responsibility
as members of the Security Council towards those participating in
the operations whose mandates we establish," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council must continue to ensure the proper
measure of its mandates and take every possible measure to enhance
the safety and security of all those serving the United Nations in
conflict situation," he added.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Senior Official Meets US Mideast Mediator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department said
today that U.S. Middle East mediator Dennis Ross held talks with
Israel's Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh this morning but disclosed
nothing about their discussions on the possibility of resuming the
Middle East peace negotiations between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"They are consulting... about our efforts to see if we can push
forward the Israelis and Palestinians in the peace negotiations,"
spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters in his briefing. But he
said, "I don't have a report for you on that meeting."
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday he sent
Naveh to Washington with proposals for ending the four-month-old
peacemaking crisis. This follows a trip to Washington last week by
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat.
</P>
<P>
The peace negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians
have been stuck since the Israeli government decided to build a
Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have even since risen to protests against
Israel's defiance of peace accords signed by the two sides and
violent clashes occurred when Israeli police tried to suppress the
protests.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government, deliberately ignoring the real cause of
violence, trigged by its Jewish home construction, has laid the
blame on the Palestinians for the suspension of the peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Ross, Naveh said, "We need to be sure
the Palestinians are meeting their obligations to fight violence
and not incite violence."
</P>
<P>
He also indicated, "Palestinian police were involved in
terrorism against the Israelis."
</P>
<P>
Burns, however, said it was not the case that the Palestinians
authority "wants to promote terrorism."
</P>
<P>
"Chairman (Yasser Arafat) had arrested four Palestinian
authority officials over the weekend who are suspected of having
been involved in plots against Israel," Burns said. "So I think he
has clearly disassociated himself from terrorist efforts against
the state of Israel."
</P>
<P>
Burns emphasized that, while the United States will "put its
shoulder to the wheel" as a mediator, the Israelis and
Palestinians have to put the problem that has stopped the
negotiations "squarely where it should be."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Palestinian Chairman Arafat met with Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy in Brussels and they announced after the
meeting that they had made progress in bridging their differences.
</P>
<P>
But Burns indicated U.S. expectations for the Brussels talks --
sponsored by the European Union -- were very low.
</P>
<P>
"Pulling a meeting together is admirable. It won't solve the
Middle East peace problems, not by a long shot," he said.

<HEADLINE> Germany Begins Evacuations in Flood-Threatened Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 22 (Xinhua) -- German authorities have begun
evacuations in some villages of the eastern state of Brandenburg
as the rising water level of the Oder River became increasingly
threatening, said reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Along the Oder, which separates Germany from Poland, thousands
of soldiers and volunteers were piling sandbags and dumping clay
on parts of the embankment on the German side where rising water
was spilling over or leaking underneath, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry of Brandenburg had spoken of a critical
situation which had never been experienced before.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Canada Welcomes European Approval of Trapping Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Canada today welcomed a decision by
the European General Affairs Council to approve the Agreement on
International Humane Trapping Standards.
</P>
<P>
The council, which is composed of foreign ministers from the EU
countries, announced its decision to approve the agreement at its
meeting in Brussels today.
</P>
<P>
Canadian International Trade Minister called the approval "a
very positive achievement for animal welfare and an excellent
resolution to a long-standing trade irritant between Canada and
the EU."
</P>
<P>
"Together, we have shown that it is possible to develop an
agreement that accommodates both environmental and trade
considerations," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The agreement lays down standards for all trapping methods
involving mechanical devices used to catch 19 species of wild
mammals.
</P>
<P>
Parties to the agreement will be obliged to prohibit trapping
methods that don't comply with the standards within an established
time frame.
</P>
<P>
The EU approved a regulation in November 1991, banning the use
of jaw-type leghold traps in the EU as well as the importation of
fur and fur products of 13 species from countries that had not
prohibited the use of these traps.
</P>
<P>
It delayed application of the regulation to Canada while
negotiations were underway.
</P>
<P>
The fur industry in Canada employs up to 100,000 people and
generates up to 450 million U.S. dollars in economic activity
every year, according to the government.
