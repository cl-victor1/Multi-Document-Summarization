</P>
<P>
Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) president Sheikh Ahmed Al-Fahad
Al-Sabah of Kuwait lit the flame which will be relayed from the

<HEADLINE> UAE President Warns Against Threat Caused By </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 14 (Xinhua) -- United Arab Emirates' (UAE)
President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan warned today that the
continuation of Iraqi people's suffering caused by the
U.N. sanctions would threat the Gulf region's "future and fate."
</P>
<P>
In his annual address at the meeting of the UAE's Federal
National Council held here today, Zayed said Iraq has suffered
heavy losses in the past years and such losses would push the Gulf
region to a razor's edge.
</P>
<P>
"The continuation and aggravation of the Arab Iraqi people's
sufferings will impose deep and dangerous effects on the future
and fate of the (Gulf) region," he warned.
</P>
<P>
"We do hope the international community to put an immediate
end to the Iraqi people's sufferings...to keep the region
away from violence and wars," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, which has been under the U.N. sanctions since its 1990
invasion of Kuwait, recently claimed that it has lost 1.25 million
women and children during the past seven years due to the lack of
food and medicines.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. report showed that Iraq also suffered heavy income
losses which were estimated at 120 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Gulf Arab states, including the UAE, have repeatedly called
for the end of the U.N. sanctions against Baghdad to ease the
sufferings of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Some Gulf officials privately voiced their worries that the
stern U.N. sanctions could force Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
to stake everything on a single throw against the Gulf region's
security if Baghdad was continuously kept difficult to "breathe."
</P>
<P>
In his address, the UAE president also stressed that the UAE
"strongly and completedly" supports Iraq's territorial integrity,
independence and sovereignty, and refuses any foreign interference
in Iraq's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
He did not identify the foreign interference, but observers
here noted that he could implicate Turkey's military incursions
into northern Iraq and Iran's air raids against rebel bases in
southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkish troops have repeatedly crossed the border with Iraq to
search anti-government Kurdish guerrillas in the mountainous
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iran, a long-term potential threat considered by Gulf Arab
countries, recently launched air strikes against rebels based in
southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The UAE and other Gulf Arab states strongly blasted the
military operations and called for fully maintaining the
territorial integrity of Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Poaching Increase in Southern Africa Denied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Conservationists in southern
Africa today deny there has been an increase in poaching in the
region since the convention on international trade in endangered
species (CITES) decided to downlist the African elephant in June.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe News Agency quoted statements issued today by the
Zimbabwe Trust and the Wildlife Environment Society of South
Africa as saying that there had not been any measurable increase
in elephant poaching so far while in some areas it had gone down.
</P>
<P>
At the June conference of parties to CITES in Harare, the
African elephant was downlisted from appendix one where trade is
banned to appendix two where controlled trade is allowed.
</P>
<P>
Conditions were set under which Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe
could resume controlled but strictly limited trade in ivory by
1999 provided there was no increase in poaching activities.
</P>
<P>
Many animal rights groups, which heavily fought the
downlisting, have published materials claiming that there was an
increase in poaching activities in the past six months.
</P>
<P>
But Secretary General of the Zimbabwe Trust Rob Monro said
Traffic, the official monitor for decisions made by CITES had not
found any evidence of the purported increase in poaching.
</P>
<P>
''As far as we can see in some places, the rate of poaching
actually fell over the past six months. If poaching is going to
escalate now, we will be inclined to blame those who claim now
that it is on the increase,'' Monro said.
</P>
<P>
The U.K.-based International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW)
reported recently that a total of 29 elephants had been poached
in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Wildlife Society has refuted this saying poaching
had actually gone down compared to the previous four years.
</P>
<P>
Board member of Wildlife and Environment Society of South
Africa Bruce Davidson said the reports of increased poaching were
surprising as it appeared that poaching levels may even be lower
since the CITES decision was made.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has already voted to follow the CITES
decision by incorporating the regislations set on trade in
elephant products in the European law.
</P>
<P>
It will therefore be possible for commercial shipments of
elephant hides and personal tourist items of leather and ivory to
be made from Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe to enter Europe
beginning the end of this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 14 (Xinhua) -- A two-day regional conference
opened in Chinhoyi of north Zimbabwe today with the aim of
stimulating integrated development in southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
Organizer of the conference, Zimbabwe Integrated Program (ZIP)
today said the conference is part of a larger project to promote
integrated development in the region using its experience in
Zimbabwe to generate similar activities in other countries.
</P>
<P>
ZIP said in a statement that two special characteristics of
its program, the promotion of linkages between developmental
activities and networking between professionals and grass-roots
will be presented as role models to other southern African
countries.
</P>
<P>
The speakers at the conference from Zambia, Tanzania,
Botswana, Zimbabwe, Malawi and the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) will present papers on recent socio-economic development in
the Southern African Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
The papers also dwell on democratic changes in central Africa
including trends and challenges for political and economic
development, the role of the media in integrated development and
the impact of economic reforms in the countries of the region.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 14 (Xinhua) -- About 26,000 residents were
evacuated out of the western German city of Ludwigshafen today as
bomb experts moved in to defuse a 4,000-pound bomb dating back to
the World War II.
</P>
<P>
Several hours after the mass evacuations, experts announced
that the bomb, which was found Friday in a field next to a
highway, had been successfully defused.
</P>
<P>
In case of an explosion, residential buildings within a radius
of 70 meters would be totally destroyed, experts said, adding that
the huge impact would also damage an alkohol factory some 200
meters away from the bomb site.
</P>
<P>
Nearby railway, river and air transportation services have also
been interrupted for several hours during the operations which
involved over 1,200 local officials and aid workers.

<HEADLINE> British Scientists Find Planets around Stars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 14 (Xinhua) -- British scientists using a new
astronomical camera have found what they believe is conclusive
evidence of planets circling four of the closest stars to Earth,
The Observer newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
"It's planets. I've no doubt," Wayne Holland, one of a team of
scientists at Edinburgh's Royal Observatory who developed the
camera, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The new camera, the Sub-millimeter Common User Bolometer Array
(SCUBA), is cooled to within one-tenth of a degree of absolute
zero, minus 273 Centigrade, enabling it to pick up faint heat
emanations from gas and dust particles warmed by stellar
radiation.
</P>
<P>
It has been fitted to the Observatory's Maxwell telescope 4,000
meters above sea level on the Mauna Kea mountain in Hawaii and
used to probe four stars, Beta Pictoris, Fomalhaut, Epsilon
Eridani and Vega.
</P>
<P>
These stars are all relatively young -- about 200 million years
old compared with several billion for our Sun -- and are all
within 24 light years from Earth.
</P>
<P>
The Observer said the scientists reported to Britain's Royal
Astronomical Society at a meeting last week that each star was
surrounded by a vast halo of dust, but the center of the area was
clear of material.
</P>
<P>
It quoted the leader of the survey team, Professor Ben
Zuckerman of the University of California, as saying there were a
number of possible explanations -- but planets were far the most
likely.
</P>
<P>
Zuckerman said: "Radiation from the stars may have driven these
particles deeper into space. However, easily the most convincing
reason is that they have been swept clean by planets orbiting near
each star."
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the discovery was bound to lead to
speculation that planets were a common feature of our galaxy.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Ruling Party to Win Local Elections: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The Liberation Front of
Mozambique would win in the local elections if held in Maputo and
Matola now, the Mozambique Information Agency reported today
quoting a survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey conducted recently by the Sampling Office under
the Comprehensive Polytechnic University of Mozambique shows that
1,325 people of 2,560 interviewed would vote for the ruling
Liberation Front in local elections to be held on May 29 next
year.
</P>
<P>
It means that the ruling party will win more than half of
votes in the forthcoming local elections, the report said, adding
that only 14.8 percent of the surveyed, that is 380 people, would
vote for the biggest opposition party the National Resistance
Movement of Mozambique (Renamo).
</P>
<P>
According to the survey by the private university, among the
surveyed, 53.5 percent said that they voted for the Liberation
Front of Mozambique in 1994 general elections and 10.4 percent
said they voted for the Renamo.
</P>
<P>
The survey indicates that the support rate for the ruling
party has dropped a little bit while that for the Renamo has
picked up in Maputo and Matola.

<HEADLINE> Britain Warns EU against Beef Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Britain will block beef imports
from other European Union countries if they do not comply with the
standards set out by an agreed plan to improve butchery practices
and make it safer to eat, agriculture minister Jack Cunningham
said today.
</P>
<P>
He told BBC television that EU farm ministers agreed in July to
adopt a new hygiene policy from the start of next year under which
the brains, eyes and spinal columns of cattle would be removed
after slaughter.
</P>
<P>
"There are now signs in Brussels that the opponents of that
decision have been working to have the implementation date put
back again," Cunningham said.
</P>
<P>
If fellow EU farm ministers drag their heels over the plan at a
meeting this week, Cunningham warned, he will ask parliament for
powers to bar imports of carcasses from which high-risk offal has
not been removed.
</P>
<P>
The EU has banned exports of British beef since March last year
following a discovery by scientists that mad cow disease could be
transmitted to humans who ate infected meat.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni President Ali
Abdullah Saleh arrived in Oman's capital Muscat today for a
three-day official visit, the Omani News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, Saleh told reporters that he will discuss
with Omani leaders ways and means of promoting bilateral
cooperation, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Observers noted that Saleh's visit came before the forthcoming
summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) due on December 20-22
in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
He is believed to seek Oman's support for Yemen's application
for GCC membership.
</P>
<P>
Yemen submitted its application last year to the regional
economic, political and defense alliance, which groups Oman,
Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
Yemen's ties with GCC members soured in 1990 due to its support
for Iraq in the Gulf crisis. It has been trying to mend fences
with the oil-rich countries after the 1991 Gulf War, which drove
Iraq out of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Calls for Political Unification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The African National
Congress (ANC) would welcome a merger with the Inkatha Freedom
Party (IFP) in the interests of national unity, South African
President Nelson Mandela said here today.
</P>
<P>
Interviewed in his capacity as outgoing ANC president ahead of
next week's party national conference, Mandela said a merger
between the two parties would be "a very progressive development"
as South Africans needed to speak with one voice.
</P>
<P>
Representing eight million people of the Zulu tribe, the IFP
is the largest black opposition in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said the proposed merger had nothing to do with black
unity, as the country had had progressed beyond ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
"It is not question of black unity, but the unity of the
entire country that will be the guiding principle. We are busy
with the task of uniting the entire nation. That's why we have
the government of national unity," said the president.
</P>
<P>
Mandela dismissed the perception that this would lead to a
single party state as in some other parts of the continent, or
that it would polarize South Africa on racial lines.
</P>
<P>
The ANC was not only looking to the IFP, but wanted a
relationship with other political parties as well, he added.

<HEADLINE> UNSCOM Chief Says Progress Being Made in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 14 (Xinhua) -- U.N. chief inspector Richard
Butler said today "some progress has been made" in today's
technical talks between U.N. arms inspectors and Iraqi officials.
</P>
<P>
Butler, Chairman of the United Nations Special Commission
(UNSCOM) in charge of eliminating weapons of mass destruction in
Iraq, made the remarks at a press conference here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He said that he and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz will
attend this evening's technical talks between both sides.
</P>
<P>
Aziz requested him on telephone that both of them take part in
tonight's technical talks, said Butler, describing Aziz's offer
as "positive development."
</P>
<P>
"He (Aziz) would be in a position to give me a fuller report on
the biological area tonight," said Bulter, adding that he
anxiously expects the report.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and the UNSCOM today started the technical talks on
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. But Butler and
Aziz did not attend the talks during the day.
</P>
<P>
Bulter is scheduled to discuss with Aziz on Monday the issue of
arms inspectors' access to Iraq's sensitive sites, including
presidential palaces, which Iraq has declared off-limits for
concerns of national security and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to the Iraqi News Agency, U.N. inspection
teams continued their mission today with 11 teams searching 19
sites with full cooperation of the Iraqi side.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. arms inspectors are authorized to verify that Iraq has
complied with the U.N. orders issued in 1991 after the Gulf War to
destroy long-range missiles and biological, chemical and nuclear
weapons. Until then will the U.N. Security Council lift the
economic sanctions on Iraq imposed in 1990 after its invasion of
Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Moving to Restructure Foreign Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government is in
motion to make its foreign policy more pro-active rather than
reactive to enable the country to stand the challenges of the
next century.
</P>
<P>
In his state of the world address in the capital Abuja
Saturday, Head of State General Sani Abacha said, "a
comprehensive process of revamping and restructuring its foreign
policy apparatus" was underway to make it more result oriented.
</P>
<P>
He said the overriding aim of the nation's foreign policy was
the constant protection and safeguarding of national interest,
the News Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the main thrust of the policy was the
struggle for self determination, the alleviation of poverty and
the pursuit of self-reliant development.
</P>
<P>
Abacha noted that following development in science and
technology in the past two and half decades, the world could be
described as a global village.
</P>
<P>
But he lamented that underdeveloped nations had not benefited
much from the so called globalization.
</P>
<P>
"In reality, we have not seen a global village of
interdependence, but a global village of grossly unequal
partners," Abacha said.
</P>
<P>
The globalization had not succeeded in reducing the historical
contradictions between the developed and developing countries, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Abacha reiterated that Nigeria would continue to pursue the
goals of the Economic Community of West African States and the
economic community of African states as outlined by the
Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
He also touched the sanctions imposed by the Commonwealth on
Nigeria, saying that the measures were not only undeserved, but
also unfair.

<HEADLINE> Russian Premier to Visit Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian Premier Viktor
Chernomyrdin said here today that Russia welcomed the reports that
Turkey is ready to change the rules of navigation in the Black sea
straits.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin made the remark prior to his visit to Turkey. He
said Russia has always opposed the unilateral adoption by Turkey
of the navigation regulations in the Black Sea straits, as some of
its provisions are against the principles of free navigation
stipulated in the international convention signed in Montreal in
1936, according to the Interfax.
</P>
<P>
However, the Russian premier said, Russia is ready to cooperate
with Turkey in this area on the condition that the convention and
the recommendations by the international Maritime Organization are
observed.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that "practical problems of navigation in the
Black Sea straits can be tackled without amending this document,
given good will and readiness to cooperate on the basis of
international law."
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said that Russia is determined to broaden the
bilateral cooperation with Turkey in the area of power. He
expressed hope that his coming visit to Turkey would promote the
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The volume of trade of the two countries has reached four
billion U.S. Dollars, up 17 percent compared with last year.

<HEADLINE> President: Iran Expects Dialogue with US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami said here today that he expected a dialogue between Iran
and the United States, hinting at a possible rapprochement between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"I want to have a philosophical and historical interchange
with the American people and believe that whatever the
intellectual interchanges go ahead, the world will achieve
peace," Khatami said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
He said that he respects the U.S. administration because "the
U.S. government is elected by the American people."
</P>
<P>
However, Khatami blamed U.S. statesmen for having fallen
behind the times, saying that the world has changed but the
U.S. policies remained the same as before.
</P>
<P>
U.S. statesmen should understand their times and the realties
facing the world better, he said, adding that the world is moving
toward a multi-polar system, but the U.S. is trying to impose its
objectives on other nations and push the world toward a unipolar
system.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Iran broke their diplomatic relations
following the 1979 storming of Iranian students at the American
embassy in Tehran and capturing its staff members as hostages
for more than one year.
</P>
<P>
Washington started a strict economic sanction on Tehran since
June, 1995 and threatened to punish foreign companies which have
an investment of over 20 million U.S. dollars in Iran's oil and
gas industries.
</P>
<P>
However, both sides have taken some steps toward the
rapprochement after Khatami won a landslide victory in the May
presidential elections and announced moderate foreign policies of
developing friendly relations and cooperation with the rest of
the world.
</P>
<P>
Khatami rejected the claim that Iran was isolated in the
world, saying that Tehran played an important role in the
world's affairs, particularly in the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the best time for improving relations between
Iran and the regional states has been provided, saying that
"there may be political differences between Iran and other
Islamic and Arab states, but, there exist numerous common
grounds, so we hope that dialog would serve to resolve our
differences while honoring our principles."

<HEADLINE> Jordan Calls for More US Pressure on Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan
today called on the United States to exert more pressure on Israel
to make it abide by all the signed agreements in a bid to put the
Middle East peace process back on track.
</P>
<P>
Hassan made the remark while meeting U.S. Assistant Secretary
of State Martin Indyk, who arrived here today as part of his
regional tour aimed at paving the way for the upcoming talks
between U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Israeli and
Palestinian leaders, Jordan's official news agency Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
He urged the U.S. to put more pressure on Israel in order to
make the Jewish state implement its commitments with regards to
troop redeployment in the West Bank, the Gaza airport and other
outstanding issues.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. should play a more active role in the peace process,
Petra quoted the crown prince as saying.
</P>
<P>
On the U.S. side, Indyk briefed Hassan on the outcome of his
tour to the region and stressed the U.S.' commitment to push the
peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. appreciated the role played by Jordan in helping
achieve a comprehensive and permanent peace that respects the
rights of all the parties, said Indyk who met Palestinian
President Yasser Arafat Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Indyk said that in Albright's upcoming meetings with Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Arafat, she was expected
to press Netanyahu to present a full plan for the troop
withdrawals in order to allow the two sides to enter long-delayed
negotiations for a final peace treaty and break the nine-month
deadlock in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In late November, Netanyahu's ministers agreed in principle
to conduct a troop withdrawal from the West Bank, but since then
they have been unable to agree on the share of land to be handed
over to the Palestinians. Hardliners in the Israeli government
opposed to a larger handover.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians, however, refused Israel's redeployment plan
to withdraw troops from 6 to 8 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The already signed Palestinian-Israeli interim accords
stipulate that Israeli redeployment from 90 percent of the West
Bank should be implemented in a three-phase withdrawal to be
finished by mid-1998.

<HEADLINE> Abacha Hails State Assembly Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Head of State General
Sani Abacha has expressed satisfaction with the December 6 state
assembly election, refusing protest over alleged manipulation.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Electoral Commission of Nigeria,
during the election, the United Nigeria Congress Party (UNCP) led
all the other four parties in the election, wining about 500 of
the 989 state legislative seats.
</P>
<P>
The result however has been criticized by some parties for
alleged manipulation.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party of Nigeria (DPN), which emerged as the
second largest party during the election with about 151 seats,
threatened in its protest last Wednesday to return its
registration certificate to the government.
</P>
<P>
Some of the party's state chairmen even threatened to quit the
party if their demands are not met by the National Executive
Council.
</P>
<P>
But it seems that Abacha has turned a deaf ear to the warning.
</P>
<P>
In an address Saturday in Abuja, the capital, the head of
state described the election as a "remarkable success".
</P>
<P>
He also urged politicians to exhibit maturity and display the
spirit of sportsmanship and fair playion to ensure the successful
completion of the transition to civil rule program by October 1
next year.
</P>
<P>
According to the program, national assembly election will be
held next April, with governors and president to be elected
together in August. The president elected is scheduled for
inauguration on October 1.

<HEADLINE> Cholera Kills Over 60 in Zanzibar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar today began to
take precautionary measures to check further spread of cholera
over 500 confirmed patients have been hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
A government statement said that 37 were killed between
Saturday and Sunday while 210 confirmed patients were admitted on
Saturday alone to the Mnazi Mmoja General Hospital, the largest
medical institution in Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
Although Zanzibar's Minister for Health, Saidi Bakari Jecha,
did not give the age nor gender proportion of the confirmed
cholera deaths and admitted patients, reliable sources said today
that children were the worst affected.
</P>
<P>
Following an emergency meeting of the National Cholera Control
Committee, the government immediately took measures to check the
epidemic which is wreaking havoc for the second time on the Isles
this year.
</P>
<P>
Measures announced include the ban on all festive public
gatherings and sales of all liquid food items, such as juices and
ice creams. Hotel owners and residents have been urged to
maintain high standards of hygiene and proper sanitation to
contain the disease.
</P>
<P>
The government continued to broadcast messages, urging the
public to observe hygiene including boiling all drinking water
and using chlorinated water.
</P>
<P>
Police and security guards have to work overtime to control a
huge crowd of relatives and friends who had gathered at the Mnazi
Mmoja Hospital to know the fate of their hospitalized kith and
kin.
</P>
<P>
Security has also been stepped up to check movement of
visitors at the hospital. Many residents were seen at various
pharmacies in a frantic effort to obtain supplies of antibiotics
such as tetracycline for prevention purposes.
</P>
<P>
Most parents have confined their children indoors as a
precautionary measure against the epidemic, most prevalent during
rainy seasons.
</P>
<P>
Jecha warned that those who plan to prepare feasts and
gatherings which are among chief sources of cholera will face
prosecution in accordance with cholera quarantine regulations.
</P>
<P>
He said the programs are underway to initiate several other
emergency clinics in the areas where the disease is rampant so as
to minimize the congestion in Mnazi Mmoja Hospital and enable
health personnel to deal with the problem at once in nearby
clinics.
</P>
<P>
The health minister appealed to anyone who may develop even
the mildest symptoms of cholera to report to the hospital for
treatment.
</P>
<P>
When death occurs at home, it should also be reported to
obtain expertise consultation and for burial arrangements. Six
patients have been reported to have died at home since the
disease outbroke, he added.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Experts Worried at Cancer Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian medical experts have
given a grim assessment of the threat of cancer, saying that more
people in the country will be killed by the disease in the years
to come.
</P>
<P>
"We expect deaths from cancer to rise by 77 percent from now
till the year 2020," said Abayomi Ferreira, president of the
Guild of Medical Directors of Nigeria, quoted by the News Agency
of Nigeria today.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar on cancer here over the weekend, the president
noted that deaths from communicable, maternal and nutritional
deficiency diseases were expected to drop by more than half
within the same period.
</P>
<P>
Apart from spreading various means of treatment, he called on
the government to launch a public health education scheme.
</P>
<P>
In the case of patients with cancer of the breast, according
to him, even some high grade health workers, including nurses,
headed for prayer houses instead of hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Thus public enlightenment on the disease was an urgent job, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Cancer was first diagnosed in Nigeria in 1934.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Deliberates Further Pullback, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli cabinet today held
its first deliberation on the planned second redeployment in
the West Bank and guidelines on permanent talks with the
Palestinians, but failed to reach a solution.
</P>
<P>
During the seven-hour marathon session chaired by Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the ministers reviewed two maps of
Israeli interests presented by Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
and National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon.
</P>
<P>
Opening the meeting, Netanyahu said "the Israeli government
will make decisions not under pressure but with responsibility
to do what is right for the country."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's remarks were apparently referring to media reports
that the United States is exerting pressure on Israel to make an
earlier decision on the further redeployment and final-status
talks so to advance the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
A government statement issued after the meeting said that the
cabinet would hold its second session Tuesday to further discuss
the issues in a bid to draw a final map of guidelines, which
Netanyahu is expected to present to U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright when they meet Thursday in Paris.
</P>
<P>
To prepare for his meeting with Albright, Netanyahu is to
hold a meeting tonight with visiting U.S. Assistant Secretary of
State Martin Indyk who has already met with several Israeli
ministers and Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President
Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Immigration and Absorption Minister Yuri Edelstein told Israel
Radio that it was still too early to talk about the results of
the first cabinet meeting. But he disclosed that the gap between
the two maps presented by Mordechai and Sharon is not too big
and the cabinet will reach a consensus soon.
</P>
<P>
In his map, Sharon proposes creating two security zones to
ensure Israel's security: one 20-kilometer zone east of the
Green Line to divide Israel and the Palestinian self-rule areas,
and another seven to 10 kilometers zone along the Jordan
River. Sharon calls for retaining control over the water sources
and all Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai's map, which was drawn up by the defense and
security establishment, has demarcated Israel's military red
lines and several options for the second redeployment.
</P>
<P>
The government's decision to go ahead with the second
redeployment and permanent talks with the PNA has triggered
strong opposition from some hardline coalition members and the
rightwing settlers.
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Zevulun Hammer and Transportation Minister
Yitzhak Levy of the rightist National Religious Party today
presented Netanyahu and the cabinet a draft resolution that
conditions any Israeli troop redeployment on the PNA's
fulfillment of its commitments, including extradition of
murderers and terrorists.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution also stated that, in the final
settlement, Israel should oppose the establishment of a
Palestinian state and return of Palestinian refugees, and must
strengthen its hold to the disputed Jerusalem and the existence
of all Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, hundreds of settlers from settlements in the West
Bank demonstrated outside the Prime Minister's Office today to
protest the government plan to carry out the second redeployment
and the U.S. pressure on Israel to proceed ahead with the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, including many children who blew noisy
whistles, held banners reading "Stop Oslo Process," "Americans
Don't Interfere," and "Time-out of Concessions." A number of
Jewish settlers in the West Bank also held a strike today to
protest the planned redeployment.

BAGHDAD, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
today praised the role of the private sector in easing the
hardship of the Iraqi people and difficulties in national economy
caused by the U.N. sanctions, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that the private sector is in conformity

private sector.
</P>
<P>
Saddam expressed pleasure for the development of Iraq's economy
despite increasing difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is under crippling U.N. economic sanctions imposed in 1990
for its invasion of Kuwait, which bars it from exporting oil, the
main revenue earner.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Mauritania's President
Maaouya Ould Sid'ahmed Taya has won more than 90 percent of the
vote in Friday's presidential election, a report reaching here
said today.
</P>
<P>
Official news media in the west African country said today
that Taya's vote was 90.14 percent, and the final result will
be announced later today.
</P>
<P>
An official of Taya's Democratic and Social Republican Party
(DSRP) said Taya had won 90.25 percent of the vote in Mauritania,
against less than seven percent for his closest rival, former
minister Mohamed Lemine Chbih Ould Cheikh Mailainine.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition parties boycotted the poll, saying it was
rigged in advance.
</P>
<P>
Attention therefore focused on the turnout, which the DSRP
official put at 72 percent and other sources said was at least 70
percent.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Ould Daddah, leader of the Union of Democratic Forces
(UDF) and runner-up in the last presidential election in 1992,
cited many irregularities, claiming that some polling stations
had stayed open well after the scheduled 1900 gmt close on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Taya, a Moor, came to power in a bloodless coup in 1984 and
was elected in 1992 with over 62 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
Light-skinned Moors, who freely owned black slaves until
slavery was abolished in 1980, have dominated Mauritanian
politics since independence from France in 1960.

NICOSIA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides today expressed full satisfaction with a European Union
(EU) decision to start membership talks with Cyprus in March.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters upon his return from Luxembourg, where
Clerides attended a meeting Saturday with the EU leaders,
European Commission members and leaders of the associated
countries, he said the decision made for EU enlargement at the
two-day Luxembourg summit was of "historical significance" for
both the EU and Cyprus.

<P>
He pointed out that the decision had sent a message to Turkey
that to join the EU it should constructively contribute to finding
a Cyprus solution, within the U.N. framework and in accordance
with U.N. Security Council resolutions on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Replying to questions, the president said the Greek Cypriot
side would expect to see Turkey's reactions and act accordingly.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot side was reported to be negative to the EU
decision, and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash was quoted as
saying Saturday that the EU decision was not helpful toward a
settlement to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Turkish Cypriot participation in an official
delegation of the Cyprus Republic for the EU accession
negotiations, Denktash said "if they (the EU) want our
participation, then they should recognize our state. There is no
other way."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern third of the
island following a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot side declared in 1983 a breakaway "the
Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus", which was only recognized
by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Turkish threat to annex the northern Cyprus if
the EU continues its plan to begin accession talks with the
Cypriot government, Clerides said that if Turkey went ahead to
gradually integrate the occupied northern part of the island,
"no country will accept this, neither Europe, nor the U.S., or
any other country."
</P>
<P>
He said that world leaders share the view that Cyprus'
accession course to the EU would be a catalyst for a solution to
the protracted Cyprus problem.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Criticized for Execution of Jordanians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The Cairo-based Arab Human
Rights Organization today lashed out at Iraq for executing four
Jordanians for smuggling car parts, saying that such an act is a
violation of the principles of international justice.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East News Agency reported that in a statement
released here today, the group said the penalty should be
commensurate with the crime.
</P>
<P>
"The death penalty should be only limited to the most dangerous
crimes as stipulated in the international law on civil and
political rights, endorsed by Iraq," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The organization asked the Iraqi authorities to refrain from
issuing death sentences in such cases and to abide by
international human rights criteria especially as Iraq itself is
suffering from "justice imbalance" through the U.N.-imposed embargo
on the country for more than seven years.
</P>
<P>
The four Jordanians were executed Monday on charges of
smuggling car parts which are in short supply in Iraq due to the
U.N.-imposed sanctions for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Jordan Wednesday expelled seven Iraqi diplomats and recalled its
charge d'affaires back from Baghdad in retaliation for the
execution.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, however, defended its execution Thursday, saying that it
considered smuggling "a great danger to society."

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 14 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the United
States said here today no comprehensive agreement is in sight
between the Palestinians and Israel, whose final status talks is
still a vision.
</P>
<P>
Separate meetings due next week between U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, and
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will not lead to an
agreement, said U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk.
</P>
<P>
But the meetings will be a positive step to activate the peace
process between the Palestinians and Israel, Indyk said at a press
conference after meeting with Jordanian Foreign Minister Fayez
Tarawneh.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel's proposed troop withdrawal in the West
Bank is far from enough.
</P>
<P>
Israel has proposed to pull back from 6-8 percent of the West
Bank, which the Palestinians have rejected.
</P>

The U.S. official, who arrived here today as part of his

<HEADLINE> EU to Penalize Belgium for Non-Respect of Wild Bird Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission today
announced that it had decided to seek a daily penalty of 7,750 ECU
(8,600 U.S. dollars) should Belgium not respect a European Court
of Justice ruling concerning wild bird conservation again.
</P>
<P>
The penalty was proposed in the commission's second application
to the court under the treaty of the European Union for Belgium's
failure to comply with a previous court judgement.
</P>
<P>
The case against Belgium related to non-respect of a 1987 court
judgement concerning failure to comply with a European Council
directive on the conservation of wild birds.
</P>
<P>
The council document created a conservation framework that
includes strict controls on hunting and other forms of
exploitation of wild birds.
</P>
<P>
The European Court of Justice denounced Belgium for its
permitting derogations from the directive's protection regime in
wider circumstances than the document allowed.
</P>
<P>
The Maastricht Treaty, the legislative principles of the
15-nation union, allows the union's executive body, the European
Commission, to ask the European Court of Justice to impose a
financial penalty on the member state concerned.

<HEADLINE> OECD: Asia Economy Slows Down Overall in Second Half 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The report said a strong fall of stock values was marked in
Thailand in the first half of 1997, and it extended to other
economies of the region during the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
While the prices of stocks dropped in nearly all the countries
of the region after the middle of the year, the values of stocks
in Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines dropped by 40 percent in
mid-November as compared with the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
The report said that even in China, the rapid rise of stock
values has been interrupted since the middle of the year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the currencies of the economies most directly
touched by the crisis, such as Malaysia and the Philippines,
dropped in value by 20-25 percent by mid-November.
</P>
<P>
The currencies of Chinese Taiwan and Singapore also dropped to
a lesser extent, while the Hong Kong dollar, which is the last
money subjected to speculation, kept its parity with the
U.S. dollar at the cost of higher interest rates and a strong fall
of its stock values, it said.
</P>
<P>
The report said domestic demand and fixed investment have
fallen greatly in Thailand, and to a lesser extent, in the
Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia, because of the weakening of
their stock markets and real estate markets, as well as the
postponement of some big infrastructure projects by these
countries.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the depreciation of their currencies has not been
sufficient to make for the losses they suffered through exports,
it said.
</P>
<P>
Although the economic growth rates of these economies should
not be absent except in Thailand, the economic activities have
greatly slowed down as compared with the expansion rhythm of the
previous years.
</P>
<P>
The depreciations of the currencies are bringing about
inflation pressures, but the pressure will not be fully felt until
1998, said the report.

<HEADLINE> OECD: Asia Economy Slows Down Overall in Second Half 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The report said that in economies less touched by the crisis,
such as China, Singapore, Chinese Taiwan and Hong Kong, economic
growth has remained vigorous up to now.
</P>
<P>
In Singapore, the manufacturing sector has just experienced a
vivid expansion, because of accelerating increase of consumption
and exports. In Taiwan, the formation of capital has been
maintained, although private consumption has shown signs of
difficulty, said the report.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, investments have greatly increased in the real
estate sector and mechanical construction, while the spending on
consumption remains relatively stationary, it said.
</P>
<P>
The report warned that the rising interest rates and the
effects of the negative heritage coming down from the Southeast
Asian crisis could weigh on the economic activities of Hong Kong
in the months to come.
</P>
<P>
In China, the growth remains stable despite a slowdown, as
compared with the "excessively rapid rhythm" registered in the
previous years, said the report.
</P>
<P>
It said that the "restrictive monetary policy" and "a rigorous
control of credit" exerted by the Chinese government have
contributed to controlling inflation at a low level since the
second half of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The vigor of Chinese exports has also stimulated the growth in
1997, but the domestic economy has recently shown certain signs of
slowdown, with high interest rates and weak growth of real
salaries greatly restricting the domestic demand and thus the
"internal motor of real GDP growth" in China.
</P>
<P>
The report went on to point out that the lowering of interest
rates in October by the People's Bank of China was aimed at
stimulating the growth of domestic consumption, encouraging
investments and controlling the cost of service for the debt owed
by state enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Goads Domestic Tourism After Luxor Massacre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian citizens are moving in
place of foreigners at various spots of tourist attraction to
help their government tide over a difficult time following the
November terrorist attack targeting tourism.
</P>
<P>
Damage brought on the lucrative tourism industry by the
November 17 mass killings in Luxor can be contained within few
months through giving much-needed vigor to the domestic tourism,
according to Egypt's tourism officials.
</P>
<P>
Tourism Minister Mamdouh el-Beltagui at an emergency meeting
last weekend warned against any attempt by tourist companies to
reduce the price and organize trips outside Egypt, saying that it
would deny the government a large quota of hard currency and would
be too difficult to reverse the trend when the crisis ends.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the minister suggested that these companies should
overcome the temporary crisis by selling travel packages in the
Arab market and activate internal trips for Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
A set of important decisions have been endorsed to stanch the
tragic fallout of the Luxor incident at the meeting that included
a number of ministers, senior officials and celebrities.
</P>
<P>
Among the decisions was the "100-Day Program" to activate
domestic tourism, under which banks, political parties,
professional unions and sporting clubs organize trips for their
members to places of interest and archaeological sites in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Businessmen at the meeting have donated more than half a
million Egyptian pounds (about 150,000 U.S. dollars) and made over
100 offers to finance organized domestic trips for school children.
</P>
<P>
EgyptAir, which lost 85,000 passengers in the days immediately
after the massacre and was expecting a loss of up to 600 million
pounds (176.47 million dollars) in the coming six months, has
streamlined some flight routes and offered a 50 percent cut in the
domestic air fares.
</P>
<P>
Middle-class Egyptian families and secondary school and
university students used to shun the main tourist sites in Upper
Egypt, Sinai Peninsula and the Red Sea due to high costs of
accommodation and transport.
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Hussein Kamel Bahauddin ratified a plan on
Saturday to send 6,000 high school students on trips to Luxor,
Aswan and the Red Sea tourist spots during the mid-school year
break that begins in late January.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Egyptian Gazette today quoted an Education
Ministry source as saying that the minister has allocated 1.5
million pounds (441,176 dollars) to fund the project.
</P>
<P>
Fifty delegations, comprising students from all provinces, will
be included in the trips aimed at spreading awareness among
students on the importance of the tourism industry and learning
the country's historical places at first hand.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been scrambling to save its 3.6 billion tourism
industry after six Islamic militants shot dead 58 foreign tourists
and four Egyptians before an ancient temple in Egypt's largest
tourist city of Luxor.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of tourists have canceled their trips to Egypt while
many foreign governments and tourist operators warned their
nationals to stay clear of Egypt at present.
</P>
<P>
According to a report on the official response of various
countries to the Luxor massacre, the Arab countries, Russia and
Latin America are relatively positive about Egypt's stability and
security, while some others like Britain, Switzerland, Japan and
Scandinavian countries are still suspicious.

<HEADLINE> HK Taxi Drivers Encouraged to Use Cleaner Fuel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will encourage all
taxi operators to switch to environment-friendly liquefied
petroleum gas (LPG) after a one-year trial run with 30 LPG taxis,
said an official here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a forum on air pollution, Secretary for Planning,
Environment and Lands Bowen Leung said his bureau will devise a
scheme on the basis of the operating cost data obtained from the
trial to encourage the entire fleet of 17,800 taxis to use LPG
expeditiously.
</P>
<P>
"In parallel with the trial, we are working out plans to
develop a refilling network to dovetail with the large scale
introduction of LPG vehicles," he added.
</P>
<P>
Thirty trial taxis started to drive on Hong Kong streets in
November. They provide operational data on fuel consumption and
repair and maintenance requirements.
</P>
<P>
"So far, I am pleased to note that users of the LPG taxis are
satisfied with the performance of these vehicles," Leung said.
</P>
<P>
"We aim to apply the LPG vehicle technology to taxis as a start
and then extend to other classes of diesel vehicles such as public
light buses and small school buses," Leung continued.
</P>
<P>
LPG vehicles have been in use in a number of countries such as
Japan, the Netherlands and Italy, for over 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Leung told the forum that to address air pollution issues in
the Pearl River Delta Region, the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR) has agreed with neighboring Guangdong province to
set up a study group to exchange information on air quality.

VIENNA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Austria ski federation said
on Monday it has made an appeal against Hermann Maier's
disqulification.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian was deprived of the championship in Sunday's World
Cup giant slalom at Val d'Isere, France, for taking off a ski
before crossing a red line in the finishing area and displayed it.

The International Skiing Federation (FIA) set the line to avoid
skiers making too much of a show of the Sponsor's skis.
</P>

The FIS awarded the title laterly to defending world champion
Michael Von Gruenigen of Switzerland, who finished second behind
Maier.
</P>
<P>
Federation official Hans Pum filed an official protest, saying
Maier "did not violate the spirit of the law".
</P>
<P>
Pum claimed FIS has misfunctioned the rule, which says skiers
will be disqualified when they take off both skis, while Maier
"only took off one".
</P>
<P>
Despite the disqualification Maier is still in the lead of the
overall standings.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Must Slow Down its High Population Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan must slow down its
high population growth to meet the challenges of the 21st century,
said Nafis Sadik, Executive Director of the United Nations Fund
for Population Activities.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting attended by economists here today, Nafis
said Pakistan had been left lagging behind other countries in the
region mainly because of its rapid population growth rate which
now stands at about 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1947 when Pakistan gained independence, it was the 13th most
populous country in the world with a population of 32.5 million,
but in 1996 it became the seventh with a population of 140
million, she said.
</P>
<P>
"No conceivable development pan can sustain such a rate of
population growth," she said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nafis said, the inequality between the sexes in the
country had held back its development from the outset.
</P>
<P>
"Girls are less welcome in our families than boys," she said.
"At every economic level in Pakistan, resources are not equitably
distributed between men and women, girls and boys."
</P>
<P>
In Pakistan, girls have much fewer chances of going to school
than boys, get married earlier than boys and start having children
while they are still in their teens, she said.
</P>
<P>
She said the rates of social investment in Pakistan were
considerably low compared with international norms and other
countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
While priority for large-scale investments in industry and
industrial infrastructure was the norm in most countries in the
world half a century ago, it is clearly recognized today that
investment in the human resources development is equally
important, Nafis stressed.

<HEADLINE> Exhibition on Chinese Historical Relics Opens in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 15 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition on Chinese
cultural relics, the largest of its kind ever held in Hong Kong,
was officially opened at the Hong Kong Museum of Art today.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition offers a golden opportunity for Hong Kong people
 to appreciate "the rarest and most valuable collections" of over
30 museums and cultural institutes in China, the Provisional Urban
 Council said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, entitled "National Treasures -- Gems of China's
 Cultural Relics", was opened by Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of
 the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, and will be
 open to the public from December 16 to March 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The 163 art pieces on display are in a wide range of media,
including ceramics, bronzes, jades, gold and silver wares, oracle
bone, ivory, fresco, lacquer, kesi tapestry and painting.
</P>
<P>
The exhibits, mostly class I national treasures of China,
include pieces familiar to the people of Hong Kong such as the
terra-cotta warriors from the tombs of the Qin Dynasty (221-207
B.C.) and the well-known jade burial suit of Lord Liu Sheng of the
 Western Han Dynasty (206 B.C.-A.D. 24).
</P>
<P>
Some of the gems have never been shown outside China's mainland
 before. Among them are the Tang Dynasty (618-907) Buddhist
treasures, gold and silverware and porcelain from the unique
collection of the Museum of Famen Temple in Shaanxi province.
</P>
<P>
Highlights of the exhibits also include a 2.62-meter-high Shang
 Dynasty (c. 16th-11th centuries B.C.) bronze standing figure
excavated in Sichuan province; a Western Zhou Dynasty (c. 11th
century-771 B.C.) bronze tripod weighing 226 kilograms; a set of
26 bronze bells of the Spring and Autumn Period (770-476 B.C.)
and a 15-meter-long hand scroll of painting depicting the southern
 voyage of the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, presented by the Hong Kong Provisional Urban
Council and the State Bureau of Cultural Relics of China, featured
 important archaeological finds from various regions of China
dating from the Neolithic Period to the Qing Dynasty (c. 140th
century B.C. to A.D. 1911).
</P>
<P>
The exhibits, each with detailed illustration, are divided into
 seven sections in chronological order.

Speaking at the opening ceremony, Ronald Leung Ding-bong,
chairman of the Provisional Urban Council, said these precious
cultural relics fully reveal the styles and techniques of Chinese
craft in the past ages and give a full picture of the history of
art development in China.
</P>
<P>
"At this important moment when Hong Kong reunites with China
and strides forward towards a historical new era, the holding of
an exhibition on gems of cultural relics helps the Chinese living
in Hong Kong to realize their wish to trace roots," Leung said.
</P>
<P>
This exhibitions "does not only provide a valuable opportunity
for appreciating the cultural relics, but also promotes our
understanding of Chinese culture and enrich our knowledge of the
customs, culture and beliefs of different regions of China at
various times," Leung said.

<HEADLINE> HK Sets Up Working Group to Deal with Bird Flu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) set up an
inter-department working group today to coordinate efforts towards
the prevention and control of the spread of a mysterious "bird
flu" that has killed two people.
</P>
<P>
A SAR government spokesman said the group, which comprises
representatives from various government departments, will hold its
first meeting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The group will coordinate measures necessary for the prevention
and control of the "bird flu," or H5N1 virus, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Chickens have been identified as the most likely source of a
new strain of the flu.
</P>
<P>
The move came after three more people were suspected last week
to have been stricken with the H5NI virus, bringing the number of
confirmed or suspected cases to seven.
</P>
<P>
A 5-year-old child died in May in the first known case of a
human contracting the virus. A 54-year-old man died early this
month, and a 2-year-old boy recovered after hospitalization in
November.
</P>
<P>
Three more people remained hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
The government also announced today that authorities in the
neighboring Guangdong Province have agreed to step up the
monitoring of chicken diseases at farms there.
</P>
<P>
A statement said Guangdong also plans to restrict chicken
exports to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Experts say they are baffled by the virus, and the hospital
authority has issued guidelines to the public and hospitals to
treat the potentially deadly flu.
</P>
<P>
There has been no evidence of human-to-human transmission of
the virus, and no infected chickens have been found at the market,
according to a source from the local health department.
</P>
<P>
Three more experts from the Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta in the United States arrived in Hong Kong Thursday to help
in the investigation, the source said.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization has reportedly been asked to
alert vaccine production centers worldwide to follow developments
with a view to preparing the necessary vaccine.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Meets With Ramos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin met with Philippine President Fidel Ramos here tonight and
the two leaders expressed happiness at seeing each other again
after a meeting not long ago, believing such frequent meetings are
conducive to the development of relations between their two
countries.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Jiang said that over the past year, the
overall relationship between the two nations has maintained its
momentum of development, to which the Philippine president has
contributed a lot.
</P>
<P>
"We would continue to work for safeguarding and developing the
friendly relationship and long-standing and smooth cooperation
between China and the Philippines," Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
While agreeing to Jiang's view, Ramos said the two countries
have also made new headway in cooperation in the space and
maritime fields.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped that trade between the two nations would be
further expanded and China's investment in the Philippines
increased.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the Philippines and China have also had peaceful
consultations on the South China Sea issue, which are helpful to
maintaining regional peace and stability and to furthering the two
countries' relations as well.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine president said his country would continue to
address the disputes between the two sides through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang, while expressing his agreement with Ramos,
noted that both China and the Philippines are working for economic
development, which calls for a stable environment.
</P>
<P>
"We can shelve our disputes and increase our joint studies and
cooperation," Jiang stressed.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also believed that the informal summit of East
Asian nations held here earlier today is the first of its kind in
history.
</P>
<P>
It is very important that the leaders of ASEAN, China, Japan
and South Korea sit together and seek to boost cooperation between
them, Jiang said, stressing that "it is imperative for us to
explore ways of addressing the current financial turmoil."
</P>
<P>
Both presidents are here to attend informal summits between
ASEAN and China, Japan and South Korea and between ASEAN and
China.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Presidential Race Enters Final Sprint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Kim Dae-jung, Lee Hoi-chang and
Rhee In-je, three front-runners in the South Korean presidential
race, are canvassing major cities and provinces in last-minute
efforts to gain votes.
</P>
<P>
The Grand National Party's candidate, Lee Hoi-chang, Monday,
toured the capital areas with his campaign slogan, "stability or
chaos", stressing the end of the period of "Three Kims' Politics"
(Kim Young-sam, Kim Dae-jung and Kim Jong-pil).
</P>
<P>
The fresh presidential election is scheduled to begin on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lee, whose rating has risen since he joined forces with Cho
Soon's Democratic Party last November, is expected to visit Pusan
on Tuesday, one of the most important campaigning areas for him.
</P>
<P>
Kim Dae-jung, the presidential contender of the National
Congress for New Politics, and his supporters are making campaign
trips in Chungchong, Taegu, Kyongsang and Pusan.
</P>
<P>
Kim, 72, pledged to double South Korea's per capita income to
20,000 U.S. dollars if elected president.
</P>
<P>
He also said Lee, once prime minister of Kim Young-sam's
administration, should be held responsible for the current
economic crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
Under the last poll released on November 26, Kim won the first
round with about 35 percent of the votes, while Lee ran second
with a razor-thin margin. South Korean's new election law forbids
any fresh poll among voters in December.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said Kim, who is making his fourth bid for the
presidency, has got a stronger base since his party allied with
Kim Jong-pil and Park Tae-joon's United Liberal Democrats last
November. The alliance would play an important role in the
forthcoming election.
</P>
<P>
Rhee In-je, the candidate of the New Party by the People, is
working hard in Pusan and South Kyongsang with a campaign slogan,
"generational changes."
</P>
<P>
Rhee, 48, is the youngest of the three front-runners in the
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Having acted as a provincial governor and labor minister in Kim
Young-sam's government, Rhee promised to revive the ailing South
Korean economy.
</P>
<P>
"I will reignite the fire of miracle at a time when people say
the Han River miracle is over," he said, referring to the nation's
economic boom in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Rhee's poll rating surpassed Lee Hoi-chang in early November
when the latter suffered considerably from accusations that his
two sons had intentionally lost weight to escape military service.
</P>
<P>
However, Rhee's popularity began declining after he set up a
new party for his presidential race. It was described as Kim
Young-sam's shadow as its major leaders are former aides of the
president.

ANKARA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel today stressed the importance of Turkey's relations with
Russia and further development of existing friendship between the

</P>
<P>
Demirel made the remark while meeting at the presidential
palace with visiting Russian Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin,

<HEADLINE> OECD: Asian Economy Slows Down Overall in Second Half of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) says in an economic perspective
report published today that the dynamic economies of Asia, except
China's, manifested the signs of slow-down in the second half of
1997.
</P>
<P>
The economies, which include Hong Kong of China, China,
Malaysia, Singapore, Chinese Taiwan, the Philippines and Thailand,
experienced a ``relatively stable'' growth in the first half of
1997, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis originating this summer in Thailand had
exerted serious consequences on certain countries of the region,
notably Malaysia and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
China has been greatly saved from the crisis so far with an
economic growth rate expected to be maintained at nine percent
annually as inflation remains low, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that the big deficits, strong dependence
on short-term foreign investments and rapid increases of
unproductive economic sectors in those crisis-affected economies
had resulted in the drop of confidence by international creditors.
</P>
<P>
These factors also make these economies vulnerable to the
withdrawal of foreign capital, said the report.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine currency, the
peso, plunged by 3.7 percent today to a new record low of 38.853
pesos against the U.S. dollar, closing at a weighted average of
38.359 pesos.
</P>
<P>
This is the third new historical low the peso has reached in
three straight trading days. Last Friday, it sank to a new low of
37.36 pesos a dollar from the previous day's 36.585 pesos.
</P>
<P>
So far the peso has devaluated by 47 percent since the
financial meltdown began to spill over from Thailand to other
Southeast Asian nations in July.
</P>
<P>
The Thai baht's fall to a new record today, heavy corporate
demand for the greenback and continuing regional currency worries
drove the peso down, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Bankers Association of the Philippines President Deogracias
Vistan said over radio that there is "pressure for the peso to
fall to 39 pesos" against the dollar due to regional developments.

<HEADLINE> Kinkel Regrets Turkey's Reaction to EU Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 15 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel Monday regretted Turkey's announcement that it would end
political dialogue with the European Union (EU) because it had
been excluded from the EU expansion move in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Calling Turkey's reaction "harsh and brusque", Kinkel said: "It
should not and will not be Ankara's last answer."
</P>
<P>
The 15-member EU agreed at its Luxembourg summit last weekend
to invite Estonia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and
Slovenia as well as Cyprus to begin membership negotiations early
next year.
</P>
<P>
Five other eastern European candidates -- Bulgaria, Latvia,
Lithuania, Romania and Slovakia -- were placed on a slower
negotiating track.
</P>
<P>
However, the EU leaders did not accept Turkey, which has been
seeking EU membership for 34 years, as an official candidate.
Instead, they offered to invite Ankara to take part in a
pan-European conference next year as a means of keeping the
country within its enlargement process.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government said the offer was insufficient and
declared that political dialogue with the EU was at an end.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters today in Bonn, Kinkel said that the
Luxembourg summit had made a fair proposal and expressed the hope
that "a more sober and detached point of view would prevail in
Ankara after the settling down of the last dust".
</P>
<P>
He insisted that Turkey's entry into the EU would have to go
through the human rights issues, its relations with Greece and the
Kurdish problem.
</P>
<P>
"But the door remains open," Kinkel said.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed the notion that religious issues had influenced
the EU's consideration of Turkey's membership.

SHENYANG, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Officials in Shenyang,
capital of northeast China's Liaoning Province, plan to rebuild
its wild animal park to better protect its inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
The new park is expected to cover an area of 3.3 million square
meters, and will have at least 200 species representing the
animals of northeast China.
</P>
<P>
About 10,000 animals will be in the new park. The park, unlike
the zoo, is a nature reserve where animals roam free so that they
can "return to the wild."
</P>
<P>
The present wild animal park, located in the southeast area of
the city, occupies only an area of 460,000 square meters and has
only 100 species of animals, which are mainly fed by the keepers.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, experts are investigating the
terrain, hydrology and vegetation of sites in the southeast and
northeast of Shenyang to choose the best location.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Investment Helps China's Aid-The-Poor Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, December 15 (Xinhua) -- As many as eight million
poverty-stricken people in west and southwest parts of China have
benefited from World Bank loans of 610 million U.S. dollars for
aid-the-poor projects.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995 China has cooperated with the World Bank on
aid-the-poor projects in the country's western and southwestern
areas including Guangxi Zhuang, Ningxia Hui and Inner Mongolia
autonomous regions; and Guizhou, Yunnan, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu
and Qinghai provinces.
</P>
<P>
Since the country opened up in late 1978, China's economy has
grown rapidly. While the country still has more than 58 million
people living in poverty, most of those inhabit the arid and
mountainous areas in west China.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank's participation in the projects is viewed as an
important force for helping the country eliminate poverty by the
turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
The aid-the-poor projects cover a wide range of fields such as
land development, rural infrastructure, enterprise development,
education, health care and the establishment of organizations.
</P>
<P>
The "Southwest Project" is the country's first aid-the-poor
effort which introduced World Bank loans. The project was begun in
1995 and covers the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and Guizhou
and Yunnan provinces. The project is the largest of its kind in
the country in the use of overseas investment and has so far cost
a total of more than 1.2 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Three years of effort has helped Guangxi, Guizhou and Yunnan
add more than 700-kilometers of rural roads and 3,570-hectares of
terraced fields, and transform 12,000-hectares of middle- and
low-yield farmlands. More than 370,000 local poor now have access
to water supply and a number of facilities have been built for the
development of local education, health care and industries.
</P>
<P>
Another project covering Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces and
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is well under way. It is estimated
to cost more than 3.3 billion yuan, including 200 million U.S.
dollars in World Bank loans. The project is expected to help more
than 2.3 million poverty-stricken people get enough food and
clothing.

SHANGHAI, December 15 (Xinhua) -- In Shanghai, 15 percent of
local residents have bought life insurance policies -- 6 percent
more than the country's average.
</P>
<P>
Wu Yongyuan, a local insurance expert, attributed the fast
development of the industry in the city to its booming economy.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is 15-to-18 years ahead of the country's average in
terms of its economic development, which has led to a remarkable
increase in local income, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shanghai has entered into the period of an aging
population and negative population growth, far ahead of the
country's average.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the ratio was 6-4 between property insurance and life
insurance, but the ratio reversed in 1996, according to official
figures.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 11 Chinese and foreign insurance companies are doing
business in Shanghai.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 15 (Xinhua) --The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- President Mohammed Khatami of Iran professed "great respect"
for the United States and said he hoped that American politicians
would "understand their own time" and stop trying to isolate his
country. Iranian and American diplomats have been exploring ways
to end the civil war in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz of Turkey said his government
would freeze its political contacts with the European Union and
seek a "strategic partnership" with the United States. The move
came after the European Union rejected talks on Turkey becoming a
member, and after Islamic leaders at a conference in Iran voted to
condemn Turkey for its military ties to Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton has decided to fly to Bosnia next week,
both to spread some holiday cheer among U.S.peacekeeping forces
there and to underscore what he believes is the need for an
extended American presence to finish reconstructing the war-torn
country. Clinton probably will leave Washington either Sunday night
or the next night and visit both Sarajevo and Tuzla.
</P>
<P>
-- Panic moved from South Korean stock markets to supermarkets
over the weekend as people rushed to hoard staple foods, and Kim
Dae Jung, a leading candidate in Thursday's presidential election,
declared in a televised debate with his rivals that the country is
facing its "biggest crisis since the war."
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- South Korea is pressing the U.S., Japan and the IMF for
accelerated aid. But Washington and Tokyo are balking at sending
the signal that Korea can pressure them into advancing it money
without taking the tough measures prescribed by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
-- The big Three U.S. auto makers are bracing for an
intensified bout of import competition from Asian rivals, whose
weaker home currencies put them in a position to hold down vehicle
prices and bolster U.S. sale. In Japan, after years of a
stagnating economy, the yen has weakened so much against the
dollar that boosting vehicle shipments to the U.S. is hard to
resist.

<HEADLINE> Israel Seals and Demolishes Suicide Bombers' Homes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli security forces
today sealed and demolished homes of families of suicide bombers
who carried out attacks in Jerusalem this summer, Israel Radio
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that two houses were destroyed and another two
were sealed off in the Palestinian village of Aseera Al-Shamaliya
near the West Bank city of Nablus.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security forces got permission from Israeli High Court
last week to take the demolition actions in a bid to "curb
terrorism."
</P>
<P>
The court said that the families provided food and shelter to
terrorists for a long period of time; and court President Aharon
Barak stressed that the intent of the punishment is to deter
potential terrorists in the future.
</P>
<P>
Five Hamas activists blew off themselves in Jerusalem's Mahaneh
Yehuda Market and Ben Yehuda Shopping Mall this summer, killing
25 people and wounding hundreds. Since the attacks, Israeli
security forces have been beefed up in the territories to fight
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian and Israeli human rights groups said
hundreds of homes in areas of the West Bank which remain under
Israeli military control have been threatened with demolition.

<HEADLINE> Informal Summit of East Asia Held in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of ASEAN and
China, Japan and South Korea held their first informal summit here
today with a shared view on the perspective, development and
cooperation of East Asia in the 21 century.
</P>
<P>
As the summit was informal, the leaders were free to deliver
speeches in a happy and relaxed manner.
</P>
<P>
Delivering his speech entitled "Join Hands in Cooperation and
Build a Future Together," Chinese President Jiang Zemin recalled
the profound changes and tremendous progress that have taken place
in East Asia in the 20th century, especially in the past two or
three decades. Relatively sound conditions are available for East
Asia to raise its economic and social development to a new level
in the 21st century, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also stressed the need to look squarely into the
difficulties and obstacles on the way ahead such as irrational
economic structure, imperfect financial system, extensive mode of
growth and backward infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
He said Southeast Asia's financial turmoil in recent months has
taught people a profound lesson and stressed that East Asian
countries should further strengthen cooperation for the benefit of
the peoples in the region.
</P>
<P>
Attending the summit were Chinese President Jiang, Japanese
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and South Korean Prime Minister
Koh Kun, host Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad,
Philippine President Fidel Ramos, Chairman of the Myanmar State

<HEADLINE> State Firms Reduce Losses, Increase Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The government's efforts to
help state-owned industrial enterprises reduce their losses and
increase profits have yielded notable results in the first three
quarters of this year.
</P>
<P>
The good news was attributed to constant improvement in the
country's macro-economic environment and the implementation of
concerned policies and measures.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made jointly by the State Statistical
Bureau, the Ministry of Finance and the State Economic and Trade
Commission.
</P>
<P>
According to the announcement, local governments at all levels
have increased efforts to reform enterprises and to supervise
major debt-ridden firms. The general performance of state
companies had improved, but quite a number remain in the red.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months, 674,000 state-owned industrial firms
produced 199.66 billion yuan in pre-tax profits and 22.56 billion
yuan in net profits, up 10.31 percent and 67.74 percent over the
corresponding period last year, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The composite index of the economic performance of state
industrial firms went up 2.59 percent compared with 1996.
</P>
<P>
Companies owned by the central government performed better than
those owned by local governments in the period as the former have
reduced their losses and increased profits.
</P>
<P>
By the end of September, centrally owned firms made a net
profit of 30.99 billion yuan, up 43.3 percent year-on-year, while
locally owned companies suffered a net loss of 252 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter, state-owned industrial enterprises in 14
provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities were in the
black, one more than the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Major profitable state companies have played a big role in
reducing losses, while a large number of small- and medium-size
state firms are suffering losses.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets With Myanmar Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and Chairman of the Myanmar State Peace and Development
Council Than Shwe today expressed satisfaction with the
development of the relations between their two countries.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting here with Than Shwe, Jiang said that in recent
years, the ties between China and Myanmar have maintained the
momentum of all-around development and the Chinese government has
always attached importance to the promotion of friendly relations
with Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pledged that his country would make continuous efforts to
promote its neighborly friendship with Myanmar oriented toward the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
He said the economic and trade cooperation between the two
countries has also made remarkable progress in recent years and
has great potential for further development.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that such cooperation will be pushed to
a new high through the joint efforts of the two governments and
the business circles of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang congratulated Myanmar on its joining the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), saying the development and the
strengthening of ASEAN is conducive to lasting peace and long-term
development in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Than Shwe said there exist traditional friendly relations
between the two countries, nurtured by their elder leaders.
</P>
<P>
"We are responsible for and committed to maintaining,
consolidating and promoting the friendship between Myanmar and
China. We would never forget the support and assistance provided
to us by the Chinese government at the time when Myanmar faced
difficulties," he said.
</P>
<P>
Than Shwe briefed Jiang on the efforts and achievements Myanmar
has made in its economic development in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Congratulating Myanmar on the improvement and development of
its economy, Jiang said, "The world is a diverse one and each
country has the right to choose its social system and road of
development in the light of its own conditions." "The domestic
problems faced by any country should be dealt with by its own
people and the problems faced by the world should be settled by
the countries concerned through friendly consultations."
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also spoke highly of the informal summit of
East Asian nations held here today and shared the view that the
exchange of views informally by the leaders is conducive to mutual
understanding between the countries concerned and to seeking
common ground while reserving differences.
</P>
<P>
Jiang believed that the difficulties faced by Southeast Asian
countries would be overcome gradually.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident of the future of Asia's economic development,"
Jiang said.

TOKYO, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Following weaker-than-expected
business confidence shown in a quarterly survey of the Bank of
Japan (BOJ), the U.S. dollar hit a high of 131.60 yen in Tokyo on
Monday, the highest in five years and seven months.
</P>
<P>
At 5 p.m., the dollar was quoted at 131.35-37 yen, up from

Friday in New York.
</P>
<P>
The BOJ said the Tankan index, measuring the sentiment of

three in September to minus 11 in December. The central bank also
said the leading non-manufacturers' index also fell from minus 15
in September to minus 20 in December.
</P>

The lackluster report sent the dollar above the mid-131 yen
level after sinking to a low of 130.25 yen earlier in the day,

<HEADLINE> Iran Reiterates Readiness to Improve Ties with EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran today restated that it
was interested in improving relations with the European countries
following the resolution of the diplomatic row with the European
Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
"We are interested in improving economic relations with the
European countries based on respect for mutual principles and
values," Iran News today quoted deputy foreign minister for
economic affairs Mahmoud Vaezi as saying.
</P>
<P>
Vaezi said that the Iranian government would discuss the
conditions for relations between Iran and the European countries
following the return of the EU ambassadors to Iran and their
Iranian counterparts to Europe.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that the relations between Iran and
Germany in the future needs to be reconsidered and reconstructed
"since the recent political problems with Germany was followed
by certain reflections in other European countries."
</P>
<P>
"Obviously a prolonged and stable economic relationship
necessitates a trustworthy political relationship," Vaezi said,
adding that political relationship could not be differentiated
from that of the economic ties.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iran and the EU countries cooled down with
the withdrawal of EU ambassadors from Tehran after the Berlin
court issued statement accusing Iranian leaders of sponsoring
terrorist activities in Germany against Iranian outlawed Kurdish
leaders.
</P>
<P>
The diplomatic standstill was over last month only after
the two sides compromised on the return of the EU ambassadors
in two groups, with the German envoy as the last one to be
back in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Vaezi said that Iran and the European countries have always
been good partners and have cooperated in energy, mining,
industrial and agricultural projects.
</P>
<P>
"Trusting the existing relationship they could move on under
new circumstances," the Iranian official said, naturally with
the ambassadors' return "we will be looking forward to observe
relations in a better political climate."
</P>
<P>
He noted that Iran's policy was to focus on the export
of petrochemical byproducts as a possible replacement for crude
oil, saying that "our tenders are placed for the participation
of all countries and are not allotted to certain companies."
</P>
<P>
Vaezi also reiterated Iran's desire to establish an Islamic
common market despite the difficulties facing the Islamic
world.
</P>
<P>
The eighth summit of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference (OIC) approved the Iranian proposal on an Islamic
common market and assigned a special committee to follow up
the issue and report to the next foreign ministers' meeting to
be held in Doha 1998.

<HEADLINE> Computer Network Useful in Chinese Army to Treat Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Computer has become an
important means to treat the ill or save the life of the wounded
in the Chinese army, military sources said.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 military hospitals have been linked to a computer
network which helps doctors jointly diagnosis difficult diseases.
</P>
<P>
In this way, those in frontier and remote areas are able to
receive better and more timely treatment.
</P>
<P>
Computers were put into use by the Chinese army in the early
1980s and mainly were used for command activities and military
drills.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the network played a vital role in saving the life of
Yang Xiaoxia, a young peasant girl from east China's Shandong
Province. Yang suffered from a rare disease that was causing
severe rotting of muscle and bone in her arm.
</P>
<P>
Unable to halt the disease, doctors with the General Hospital
of the Beijing Military Command sent the case to foreign
counterparts via the Internet. They received more than 300 pieces
of medical information about the disease.
</P>
<P>
The doctors then consulted with 60 Chinese specialists in
military and civil hospitals, only to find that the disease
resulted from several types of rare virus. Finally they succeeded
in curing the disease.
</P>
<P>
The case was listed as one of the 10 top news stories in the
country's medical science in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Second Round of Iraq-UNSCOM Talks Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The second round of official
talks on Iraq's dismarment between Iraq and the United Nations
Special Commission (UNSCOM) started here Monday morning, Iraqi
News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz represented the Iraqi
side while Richard Butler, executive director of the UNSCOM on
dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, headed the U.N.
side, according to the INA.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi side includes Oil Minister General Amir Mohammed
Rashid and Amir Al Saadi, adviser at the presidential office and
director of the Military Industrialization Organization, as well
as a number of experts of the Foreign Ministry and military
industry.
</P>
<P>
Aziz met Butler in the first round of the talks last night,
which lasted more than three hours at the headquarters of the
Foreign Ministry. The two sides refrained from making statements
on the results of the talks.
</P>
<P>
Aziz has informed Butler that he is going to hand the
U.N. chief arms inspector a report on Iraqi biological
weapons. Butler has said that he deems such a move a positive step
of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here believe the second round of the talks
focus on the delicate question of the entry of the U.N. arms
inspectors into the Iraqi presidential palaces which Iraq
considers as symbols of its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Butler will face difficulty in convincing the Iraqi leaders of
allowing the arms inspectors to enter the palaces, the observers
said.
</P>
<P>
So far, Iraq has been refusing to grant access to U.N. arms
inspectors to some sensitive sites, including presidential palaces.

<P>
NEW DELHI, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Wei Jianxing, member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau and member of the
Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China (CPC), met here today with Indian Vice-president Krishna
Kant.
</P>
<P>
Wei arrived here yesterday on a nine-day goodwill visit to
India at the invitation of Kant.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, both sides agreed to increase friendly
exchanges between the two countries and further promote the
development of bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Kant said that Wei's visit is another top-level one to India by
a Chinese leader after President Jiang Zemin traveled to the South
Asian country in November last year.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang's visit has made important contributions to
promoting mutual understanding, friendship and cooperation between
the two countries, Kant said, adding that India and China have
made rapid progress in developing bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He noted that India believes it is in the interests of both
countries for India to build up a close, mutually beneficial and
friendly cooperative relationship with China.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence
jointly initiated by India and China, Kant stressed that these are
still applicable, adding that it is conducive to peace and
stability in Asia and the world as a whole to develop
Indian-Chinese friendship on the basis of these principles.
</P>
<P>
Kant said the governments and peoples of the two countries
should make joint efforts to push their friendly cooperation to a
new high.
</P>
<P>
Wei said that China and India have made great progress in
recent years in developing bilateral relations in the fields of
politics, economy, culture, and science and technology.
</P>
<P>
"Friendship and cooperation have become the mainstream of
Sino-Indian relations," he said, adding that the two countries
share common views on peace and development and many other
international issues.
</P>
<P>
Although some issues left over by history between the two
countries remain to be resolved and bilateral economic and trade
ties need further expansion, Wei said, China and India, both with
long and splendid civilizations, can undoubtedly bring a
constructive partnership into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Wei said his current trip is aimed at deepening mutual
understanding, promoting friendship and increasing mutual trust
and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
On behalf the CPC and the Chinese government, Wei invited Kant
to visit China at his convenience and the Indian vice-president
thanked the Chinese side for the invitation.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the meeting were Dai Bingguo, head of the
International Department of the CPC Central Committee, and Pei
Yuanying, Chinese ambassador to India.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Thirsty for Foreign Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian Minister without
Protfolio Yevgeny Yasin Monday predicted that foreign investments
to Russia may reach 100 billion U.S. dollars in the six or seven
years to come.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the Russian regions' council on foreign
political and economic relations, Yasin said that foreign
investments will be made "chiefly in the fuel and energy sectors
and automobile industry where large-scale projects are already
underway or planned."
</P>
<P>
Foreign investments in Russia are very nominal at present, the
minisiter said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the world financial crisis has had a negative
impact on foreign investments in Russia. The outflow of foreign
capital from Russia as a result of the crisis was estimated at 5
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Yasin believed this capital will gradually come back as the
country's financial situation stabilizes and industrial production
grows.
</P>
<P>
He estimated the Russia's GDP may increase by two percent and
inflation will stay within 5-8 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
He said that the aerospace, nuclear energy and engineering
industries and energy equipment manufacture are Russia's most
promising and competitive industries.

<HEADLINE> Reconciliation Open to de Villa: Philippine Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Philippine House of
Representatives Speaker Jose de Venecia said today that the door
of reconciliation is open to former Defense Secretary Renato de
Villa, who bolted the ruling party and decided to run for the
presidency in the 1998 elections.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia said in a statement that as part of the healing
process, "we are keeping the door of reconciliation open to" de
Villa and his supporters.
</P>
<P>
"We reposed our trust and faith in the party and in President
Fidel Ramos, who made the impartial decision on the best candidate
to lead Lakas-NUCD-UMDP in the May 11, 1998 elections. The
president has already spoken and we expect the party to fully
support this decision without reservation," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Ramos early last week anointed de Venecia as the
ruling party's presidential candidate in the 1998 polls, instead
of de Villa as had been speculated.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held today, de Villa announced his
breakaway from the ruling party and his decision to run for the
presidency next year despite the fact that he does not have the
endorsement of President Ramos.
</P>
<P>
"Lakas-NUCD-UMDP remains the biggest party in the Philippines
and the party of the future," de Venecia added in the statement.

WUHAN, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Pilot work has officially begun
for a national reform of agriculture, which aims to turn
traditional farming into a modern industry.
</P>
<P>
This was the topic at an ongoing national symposium on
agricultural industrialization in E'zhou City in central China's

The state will issue preferential policies in terms of credit,
project arrangement, taxation and land use to help key
agricultural enterprises become market-oriented
businesses. Qualified enterprises can also be listed on the stocks.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Minister Stresses Importance of Advancing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai stressed today that advancing the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process is more important than drawing a
map on the further redeployments and permanent talks.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai was making the comments when he briefed the
Knesset (Parliament) Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee on the
defense and security establishment's position on further troop
redeployments in the West Bank and the impending final-status
talks with the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
The minister said that any decision made by the cabinet should
be based on both the security map and the map of national
interests, but the more important thing is to push forward the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai made the remarks following the first deliberation
held Sunday by Israeli Cabinet on the planned second redeployment
in the West Bank and guidelines on permanent talks with the
Palestinians. Due to inner split over the so-called map of
national interests in the West Bank, the cabinet failed to reach a
solution.
</P>
<P>
During the seven-hour marathon session chaired by Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the ministers reviewed two maps of
Israeli interests presented by Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
and National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon, which differed
on the definition of two security zones designed to provide
national security.
</P>
<P>
In his map, Sharon proposed creating two security zones to
ensure Israel's security: one 10-15 kilometer zone east of the
Green Line to divide Israel and the Palestinian self-rule areas,
and another 20 kilometer-wide zone along the Jordan River.
</P>
<P>
Sharon also called for retaining control over the water
sources and all Jewish settlements in the West Bank. Netanyahu
is reportedly in favor of Sharon's map.
</P>
<P>
But Mordechai, in his so-called security map which was
drawn by the defense and security establishment, recommended
narrowing the two security zones into three to six kilometers
and seven to 10 kilometers respectively.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet is to reconvene Tuesday in a bid to draw a
final map for Netanyahu to present to United States Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright when they meet in Paris Thursday.
The U.S. government has been pressing Israel hard to produce a
more credible and significant plan on further redeployments in
order to advance the stalled peace talks.
</P>
<P>
A poll conducted by Israel Radio today showed that most
Israelis hoped the government will produce a detailed redeployment
plan in time for Netanyahu to present to Albright. Among the
polled, 71 percent people thought that Netanyahu should give a
detailed map to Albright, while 63 percent believed that the
government's plan will satisfy the Americans.
</P>
<P>
Former Foreign Minister and Defense Minister Moshe Arens
criticized today the government for its handling of the
redeployment issue. He pointed out that the aim to draw a
map on the final settlement with the PNA should not be only
to satisfy the Americans.

<P>
Nearly 100 officials and scholars are attending the seminar
which is being jointly sponsored by the Territorial Land
Development and Regional Economic Institute under the State

</P>
<P>
The area is playing a vital role in the country's economy, said
Yu Lizhong, director of the Yangtze River Area Development
Institute.
</P>
<P>
He said the cooperation and coordination among the seven
provinces and two cities are helpful to both the developed eastern
region and underdeveloped western part of the country, forming a

HANOI, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in Vietnam's Mekong
Delta, the country's biggest rice bowl, harvested 500,000 more
tons of rice in 1997 than in the previous year, the Vietnam News
Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Seven Mekong Delta provinces each harvested more than one
million tons of rice this year despite the delayed receding flood
waters during the winter-spring crop and the damage caused by
tropical storm Linda last month.
</P>
<P>
Localities' figures showed that the total rice output rose by
800,000 tons for the winter-spring crop while the summer-autumn
output saw a drop due to a declining rice plantation area and
yield.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in Ca Mau province, severely-stricken by tropical storm
Linda, brought home a total of nearly 746,000 tons of rice.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam rice export in the first 11 months of the year reached

<HEADLINE> China Applies Gene Engineering in Crop Disease Prevention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists are
developing genetically engineered crops for the prevention and
treatment of plant diseases.
</P>
<P>
Today's Science and Technology Daily reported that China now is
developing 47 kinds of genetically engineered plants which involve
62 kinds of pest control genes.
</P>
<P>
Huang Dafang, researcher at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural
Sciences, said at a national symposium on plant protection that
China's first generation of unpaired-gene, anti-pest cotton is
undergoing a trial growth period.
</P>
<P>
He said nine provinces including Anhui, Shanxi, Shandong and
Henan have experimented with the anti-pest cotton on 566 hectares
of demonstration land.
</P>
<P>
Huang added that the second paired-gene, anti-pest cotton has
also entered a trial planting period.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists also utilized gene engineering in raising
wheat yield by 20 percent on experimental land by successfully
controlling a major wheat disease.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, agricultural gene engineering is in its basic
research period and cannot be counted upon to resolve crop
production problems in the near future.

<HEADLINE> France Criticized for not Cooperating with War-Crime Tribunal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Louise Arbour, the general
prosecutor for the Hague International Tribunal hearing war crimes
in ex-Yugoslavia, Monday criticized France for not cooperating
with the tribunal in providing evidence.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the daily, Liberation, Arbour said France
bans its military officers who served in peace-keeping forces in
ex-Yugoslavia from testifying before the court in person.
</P>
<P>
The Serb war criminals "feel absolutely safe" in the zone
controlled by French troops serving in the multi-national
stabilization force (SFOR) in Bosnia, she said.
</P>
<P>
Arbour expressed the same dissatisfaction in an interview with
the daily, Le Monde, last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Invited by French human rights groups, Arbour will visit Paris
Monday and meet with French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine and
Defense Ministry officials.
</P>
<P>
The dispute between the tribunal and France was made public
last week when French Defense Minister Alain Richard blamed the
tribunal for holding a "spectacle trial" by summoning French
peacekeepers in ex-Yugoslavia to the court to testify.
</P>
<P>
The French foreign ministry said last Friday that about 30
French military people had been summoned by the tribunal to
testify before the court.
</P>
<P>
But Paris would only allow these people to testify through
written statements rather than appearing in court in person, the
ministry noted.
</P>
<P>
The Le Monde said that in the dispute, a cultural conflict
could be observed.
</P>
<P>
The French military people were trained to remain silent rather
than speak in public, while questioning and answering in public
trials was a practice of the Anglo-Saxon judicial system, said the
daily.

<HEADLINE> PNG Leader Announces Major Cabinet Reshuffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Papua New Guinea (PNG) Prime
Minister Bill Skate today announced a major cabinet reshuffle to
shore up the credibility of his frequently changing coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
Skate pulled off a major coup by persuading former Prime
Minister Rabbie Namaliu to join as his senior minister for state,
the Australian Associated Press (AAP) reported today.
</P>
<P>
Only two weeks ago Rabbie called for Skate to stand aside and
for an inquiry into bribery allegations against the prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
Rabbie said today that he had accepted the post in the national
interest and he congratulated Skate for bringing men of quality
and integrity into the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
"I have accepted the prime minister's invitation to serve in
the ministry because I believe the national interest must be
paramount at this difficult and demanding time in our nation's
development," he was quoted by AAP as saying.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet reshuffle followed two weeks of political turmoil
which culminated in the expulsion of PNG's oldest party, Pangu,
from the government yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Skate had accused Pangu leader and former Deputy Prime Minister
Chris Haiveta of orchestrating bribery allegations against him.
</P>
<P>
Although Skate and Haiveta publicly reconciled last week, the
prime minister said yesterday that he had dismissed Pangu and its
seven ministers for disloyalty and for not supporting his
government.
</P>
<P>
The ministries in the Skate government now number 29 with some
realigned and new ones created.
</P>
<P>
Former Finance Minister Iairo Lasaro has been moved to the new
post of treasurer while the founder of Skate's People's National
Congress party, Dibara Yagabo, took over the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Skate has put himself in charge of the important defense
portfolio while former Defense Minister Mao Zeming has become
minister for housing.
</P>
<P>
Roy Yaki, who was fired by Skate two months ago as finance
minister for incompetence and for jeopardizing PNG's relationship
with China by attending a trade conference in Taiwan, has been
appointed foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Former Transport and Aviation Minister Philemon Embel has got
the crucial mining and energy portfolio.
</P>
<P>
Former deputy opposition leader Masket Iangalio, who joined the
government last week after forming a new Resources Action Party
made up of Highlands MPs, has taken over as the petroleum and gas
minister.
</P>
<P>
Skate, who claims now to have the support of 70 MPs in the
109-seat parliament, said his government is now entering a new era
of leadership and stability.
</P>
<P>
"We are at the crossroads now," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If we do not take the tough decisions now, our nation and
people will continue to face difficult times ahead."
</P>
<P>
Skate said the new team would spend the next few weeks
preparing programs for the next budget due to be delivered in
March.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Official Urges Sino-Portuguese JLG to Quicken Working Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-Portuguese Joint
Liaison Group (JLG) should step up its working process in the
remaining two years to properly resolve major issues concerning
Macao's smooth transition and handover, a top Chinese official
said.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with Xinhua on the two-year countdown
before the handover of power to China on December 20, 1999, Han
Zhaokang, chief representative of the Chinese side of the
Sino-Portuguese JLG, said both sides should work more efficiently
to lay a solid foundation for the long-term stability and
development of Macao.
</P>
<P>
"In the last two years of transition, we should have a strong
sense of historic responsibility in facing and resolving the large
number of complicated issues," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
A big gap still exists between progress in the localization of
the civil service, the localization of law and the use of Chinese
as an official language and the actual needs of a smooth
transition and handover, the Chinese ambassador noted.
</P>
<P>
And talks on issues crucial to the smooth handover, like the
transfer of archives and assets and the pension of retired civil
servants, have either just started, or never been touched, or been
stalemated.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a number of new issues have been added to the
working agenda of the JLG.
</P>
<P>
Han said, however, that he remains optimistic about the
handling of these issues so long as the two sides abide by the
joint declaration and principles of the Basic Law of Macao,
respect and trust each other and start from the long-term and
overall interests of Macao and the long-term friendship between
China and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
While stressing the need to improve the working pace, Han also
noted that certain progress has been made on the three leading
issues of transition -- the localization of the civil service, the
localization of law and the use of Chinese as an official
language.
</P>
<P>
Most of the lower-ranking civil posts have been localized and
the first Chinese director of a government department assumed
office last month. The Portuguese side promised to have all senior
and middle-ranking posts basically localized by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Criminal Law and the Code of Criminal Procedure, out of the
five leading laws in Macao, have been localized following
consultations in the JLG. Most laws enacted after 1990 have had
Chinese language versions, and a dozen local residents have been
appointed judges and procurators.
</P>
<P>
The use of Chinese as an official language has also scored
progress in the administrative, legislative and judiciary
departments of the Macao government, he noted.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, more efforts are still needed in handling the
three leading issues, especially, the localization of senior and
middle-ranking civil posts and the localization of the remaining
leading laws.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Canadian Business School Favors Hong Kong by Wang Qun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Canada's leading business
school, the Richard Ivey School of Business, plans to open a small
campus here next August, offering Hong Kong business executives
Master of Business Administration (MBA) program at their doorstep.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Dr. Paul Beamish, director of
Ivey's Asian Management Institute, spoke of Hong Kong's prominence
in the school's Asian commitment.
</P>
<P>
The campus will be the first Asian establishment for Ivey,
which celebrates its 75th anniversary this year.
</P>
<P>
An MBA program offered by a Western business school is not new
in Hong Kong, but the Ivey program is unique, he noted.
</P>
<P>
With classes fixed at Tuesday and Thursday evenings and
Saturday, the two-year program will allow business executives to
receive training without quitting their jobs.
</P>
<P>
And the program will be taught by "the best of Ivey staff"
based in Hong Kong, compared with some other Western MBA programs
here which are taught by "second-tier staff", Dr. Beamish noted.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the program will be "supported by business cases
developed specifically for Asia". Case study helps people develop
solid analytical and integrative skills for problem solving.
</P>
<P>
As the world's second largest producer of business cases after
Harvard, Ivey has produced about 80 cases with Asian relevance and
plans to produce 30 to 40 more next year.
</P>
<P>
One of the first priorities of Beamish's newly-established
Asian Management Institute is to develop Asian business cases.
</P>
<P>
He spoke of reasons why Hong Kong, ahead of other parts of
Asia, sees the first Ivey program in the region.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has a broad base of alumni of Ivey, and their support
helps bring the program into place, while on the other hand Hong
Kong is an international business center where executive MBA
training is highly demanded.
</P>
<P>
"After the handover, everybody still wants good education.
Those values don't change at all," he said.
</P>
<P>
As a regular visitor to Hong Kong, Beamish said he "hasn't seen
big change here."
</P>
<P>
But he noticed "additional pride" in local people. "They are
proud of being part of China."
</P>
<P>
"Now the program is progressing smoothly," Dr. Beamish said.
</P>
<P>
Office space has been rented at a commercial building near
Victoria Park, with two Canadian staff members and three local
employees making preparations for the small campus, which includes
classrooms, lecture rooms and a library.
</P>
<P>
The first intake is about 35 students, he said.

<HEADLINE> Small, Medium-sized Enterprises Center Set Up in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs), which form the backbone of the Hong Kong
economy, will be able to get an easy access to a variety of
services starting today with the launch of the SME Center.
</P>
<P>
The SME Center, acting as a "total solutions" service provider,
is set up by Hong Kong Productivity Council (HKPC), with funding
from the Special Administrative Region (SAR) government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Kenneth Fang, chairman of
HKPC, said, the performance of SMEs, which account for 98 percent
of Hong Kong's business establishments, is critically important to
the prosperity of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
With rising costs in Hong Kong, industry and businesses must
develop in the direction of high value-added productivity, Fang
said.
</P>
<P>
"Strengthening research and development capabilities and
improving management quality are important means toward this goal.
However, efforts in these areas involve significant financial and
manpower investment. SMEs, because of their size and limited
resources, must therefore rely on external support to improve
their competitiveness," he said.
</P>
<P>
Also officiating at the ceremony was Denise Yue, secretary for
trade and industry of the SAR, who pointed out that SMEs are now
faced with ever keener competition.
</P>
<P>
"With the opening of the center, SMEs will be able to meet the
challenges they encounter in the course of their business and
enhance their competitiveness in the global market," she said.
</P>
<P>
Located on the fourth floor of the HKPC building, the SME
Center is a one-stop service center that aims at providing SMEs
with easy access to a network of service providers covering areas
of banking and finance, information technology, forwarding and
shipping, telecommunications and insurance, among others.
</P>
<P>
The HKPC was established by statute in 1967 with the aim to
promote productivity excellence through the provision of
professional services.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Decline Sharply on Singapore Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Share prices continued to
decline sharply on the Singapore market as the benchmark Straits
Times Industrials Index lost another 32.34 points to close at
1600.64 today.
</P>
<P>
Dealers here said share prices were dragged down by Asia's
persistent economic crisis. They added that fear of Singapore
banks' exposure to the regional crisis deepened and a perception
grew that the country's economy could not escape Asia's slowdown
unscathed.
</P>
<P>
They noted that electronics stocks also succumbed to selling on
the expectation that the global electronics industry was running
out of steam.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume shrank to 182.79 million units, valued
at 443.94 million Singapore dollars (about 269.05 million U.S.
dollars). Declines overwhelmed advances by 305 to 38 while 265
other counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore Technologies Engineering was the most actively
traded stock as it registered a turnover of 17.21 million units.
It was followed by Rekapac which had 10.25 million shares traded.
Asian Food and Property (AFP) was next with 7.01 million shares
changed hands.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) Foreign led the gainers of
the day as it rose by 1 dollar to finish at 21.5 Singapore
dollars. Roth S. increased by 25 cents to end at 8.6 Singapore
dollars. Times Publishing gained 14 cents to close at 3.16
Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, DBS (Development Bank of Singapore) Foreign
was the biggest loser of the day as it declined by 2.2 dollars to
end at 13.8 Singapore dollars. Roth M. fell by 1.2 dollars to
close at 13 Singapore dollars while Bukit Sembawang and the OCBC
(Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation) Foreign dropped by 70 cents
each to finish at 11.8 and 9.7 Singapore dollars respectively.

<P>
MACAO, December 15 (Xinhua) -- A Macao school has been
designated as the future Portuguese language school after the
establishment of the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) in
December 1999.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese Education Minister Eduardo Marcal Grilo and
representatives of the local Oriental Foundation and a local
society signed an agreement last Saturday, designating the
Commerce School as the Portuguese language school after 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to a report in today's Va Kio newspaper, the
Portuguese Ministry of Education and the Oriental Foundation will
jointly fund the operation of the Portuguese language school.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law of Macao stipulates that in addition to the
Chinese language, Portuguese may also be used as an official
language by the executive authorities, legislature and judiciary
of the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Han Zhaokang, chief representative of the Chinese
side of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group, told the

if any, must be maintained and the rights and authority of the
future SAR government respected.

establishment of a Portuguese language school and further
technical negotiations are under way.

MACAO, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Business in Macao casinos has

Stanley Ho said.
</P>
<P>
Today's Macao Daily News quoted Ho, general manager of the

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leader Calls for Cemented City-to-City Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MELBOURNE, Australia, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan,
chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
National Committee, expressed the hope today that the cooperative
ties between provinces and states and cities of China and
Australia would be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is on a six-day visit to Australia, told a reception
hosted by the government of Australia's Victoria State in honor of
the Chinese guest that since the establishment of Sino-Australian
diplomatic ties 25 years ago, remarkable growth has been achieved
in the relations between provinces and cities of China and
Victoria.
</P>
<P>
Through the joint efforts of the two sides, Victoria and
Melbourne City have become the twins of China's Jiangsu Province
and Tianjin City, and such ties have also helped Victoria to
strengthen the exchanges and cooperation with other Chinese
regions and cities, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li spoke highly of the efforts Victoria Premier Jeff Kennett
and his government have made to promote the state's ties with
China, saying that bilateral cooperation will be strengthened in
various sectors.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of Premier Kennett, Victorian Minister for Education
Phil Gude and Melbourne Mayor Ivan Deveson extended their welcome
to Li. They expressed the belief that Li's visit will push forward
the ties between Australia and China, as well as those between
Victoria and China's provinces and cities.
</P>
<P>
In the evening, Victorian Governor James Gobbo hosted a banquet
in honor of the Chinese guest.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Li toured the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd.,
the largest company of Australia, which has maintained trading
ties with China for a century.

four million, the Overseas Edition of People's Daily reported
today.
</P>
<P>
More individuals will buy cars by that time and government
departments, businesses and organizations will no longer the major
buyers at the auto market.
</P>
<P>
Cars have entered some relatively affluent families, and many
more families are ready to buy cars. Many believe automobiles
will be first to enter rural families.
</P>
<P>
China will soon introduce a new set of rules on automobile
scrapping and will offer favorable policies to encourage
the upgrading of automobiles.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said Chinese automobiles were exported to 85
countries and regions in 1995 and the 1994 auto export volume
reached 400 million U.S. dollars. China expects to export 350,000
to 400,000 automobiles by the year 2010 and hopes to earn five
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, imported cars dropped to 35 percent of the total at
China's market from 60.1 percent in 1994 and with the development
of the No. 1, No. 2, Shanghai and Tianjin automobile groups,
Chinese automobiles will eventually dominate the domestic
market.

KATHMANDU, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Political instability in
Nepal, one of the poorest countries in the world, has affected the
country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
The Himalayan kingdom has seen six governments in power since
1990.
</P>
<P>
After a hung parliament emerged in the mid-term elections in
November 1994, things became even more tricky in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Since no single party commands a simple majority in the
parliament, Nepal's coalition politics has been marred by
struggles over petty interests which drove parties to change
partners frequently.
</P>
<P>
Three coalition governments have been born in the past three
years in Nepal, two in this year alone.
</P>
<P>
Frequent government changes affect Nepal's economic development
in many ways, said Dr. Kishor Kumar Guru-Gharana of the National
Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
Political instability causes policy instability, which in turn
leads to macro-economic instability, he explained.
</P>
<P>
He said as the system in Nepal is still a highly centralized
one, every time political instability happens, government
officials have to wait until the situation becomes clear.
</P>
<P>
And every time there is a change of government, not only the
prime minister and ministers, but also the secretaries, project
directors and engineers are changed. All of them have to take time
to study new things and all these delay decision-making, he said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, 90 percent of the country's projects and programs
have been affected. And on the average, there is a delay of two
years in the implementation of the projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This affects foreign investment as well as domestic
investment," said Dr. Guru-Gharana.
</P>
<P>
According to a world investment report, Nepal gets only 2
million U.S. dollars of investment every year.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, Nepal's economic situation has been very
discouraging, the U.S.-trained economist said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, Nepal's annual economic growth has been low
at 4.5 percent in recent years, and exports have been declining,
including carpet and garment, the country's major foreign exchange
earners.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, imports are growing at a slower pace than before.
"In other countries, this is a good sign. But in Nepal, not good.
Because most of our industries are based on imported raw
materials, machinery and petroleum products. It means the economy
is slack, and the industries are slack," the economist said.
</P>
<P>
Sluggish imports lead to reduction of tax revenue, which is
based heavily on imports, he said.
</P>
<P>
Many Nepalese have become tired of the political antics in the
country and said they wanted the country to be put on the right
track of economic development, as 45 percent of the country's
population of 21.6 million are still living below the poverty
line.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Rupiah Further Weakens Against Greenback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian rupiah
continued to weaken today against the U.S. dollar as people here
still worried about the health of President Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah was quoted at 5,490 against the dollar in the
morning before it recovered to 5,350 per dollar at 10:00 a.m. The
rupiah closed at 5,150/5,250 against the dollar last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers said people here still worried about the
health of President Soeharto after the announcement that he could
not attend an informal ASEAN summit in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Minister/State Secretary Moerdiono said last Friday that
President Soeharto decided to cancel his trip to Kuala Lumpur as
doctors advised him to take a full 10-day rest.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the drop of the rupiah is the weakness of
regional currencies such as those of the Philippines, Thailand,
Malaysia and Singapore. Reports said the Philippine peso and the
Thai baht reached record lows today against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian rupiah has suffered the most so far this year,
having dropped by 117 percent against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Share prices on the Jakarta Stock Exchange plunged
3.9 percent, with the composite index down 14.272 points to reach
351.579.

<HEADLINE> Residential Housing Selling Well In North China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, December 15 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei
Province has sold nearly four-fifths of its residential housing to
individual buyers this year, local sources said.
</P>
<P>
Liu Cai, director of the Provincial Housing Reform Office, said
that the province now leads the country in residential housing
sales, with 78 percent of its residential housing, more than 100
million sq. m. of floor space, having been sold by the end of
November.
</P>
<P>
Shijiazhuang, the provincial capital, sold 14.4 million
sq.m. of housing, more than 80 percent of which was residential
housing.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that Hebei has done well in its housing reforms
since the province made people more enthusiastic about owning
their own house when the rent went from 0.2 yuan per sq.m. at the
start of 1990s to the present 1.2 yuan per sq.m., Liu said.
</P>
<P>
"Rent will further increase to 1.6 yuan next year to narrow the
gap between the rent and the sale price," the director said.
</P>
<P>
The province has finished 18 million sq.m. of residential
housing projects this year. Per capita floor space in cities and
towns is above 10 sq.m., the standard for relatively comfortable
living in China.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Weaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar tumbled
below 66.00 U.S. cents today on ongoing pessimism about Asian
economies, and traders said the local currency was likely to
capitulate to further selling pressure over coming days.
</P>
<P>
The local unit finished almost half a U.S. cent lower at 65.88
US cents from 66.32 U.S. cents late Friday, after dipping to a new
four-year low of 65.80 intraday.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the slide was exacerbated by the release of the
latest Japanese Tankan report which painted a pessimistic outlook
for that country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The report confirmed the view that the Japanese economy,
already in a slowdown three months ago, was battered even more by
the recent major financial failures in Japan and the Asian
financial and economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
An expert said the region's financial woes continued to keep
pressure on the Australian dollar, ruling out any rebound.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended in Sydney at 86.56 yen, from 86.21
previously and at 1.1722 marks, from 1.1696.

<HEADLINE> Ganz Set to Leave Inter Milan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Bitter striker Maurizio Ganz is
set to leave the talent-packed Inter Milan in the New Year, he
told a local newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"By now, it's clear that with Ronaldo and (Youri) Djorkaeff
there's no place here for me," the 29-year-old striker told
Gazzetta dello Sport.
</P>
<P>
Ganz was seeking in the new season for a starting place in
Inter's front since the arrival of Brazilian Ronaldo, who not only
strengthenes Inter's attacking power, but also brings intense
competition for place in the fixed striking pair.
</P>
<P>
"I just want a team in which to play for a place Sunday after
Sunday. Here the front-line is fixed," Ganz added.
</P>
<P>
AC Milan is the first choice for Ganz, who scored 10 goals in
last year's UEFA Cup final for Inter, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Milan's manager Fabio Capello has asked Inter for Ganz,
according to one report.
</P>
<P>
Inter president Massimo Moratti, however, is unlikely release
the player until January's Intalian Cup quarter-final clash
between the arch-rivals.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks End Slightly Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Australian sharemarket
closed slightly higher after a mixed day's trade highlighted by
futures-led buying at midday, as investors continued to look for
further leads from Asia and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Henderson Charlton Jones broker Philip Toop said there had been
some switching between resource and industrial stocks throughout
the day.
</P>
<P>
"I think there's still concern about resource stocks and people
are buying into industrials for more stable earnings," Toop said.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index finished up 6.9 points at 2,500.9.
</P>
<P>
Resources giant BHP was the hardest hit of the heavyweights,
with its shares finishing 58.1 cents lower at 12.659 Australian
dollars.
</P>
<P>
BHP releases its half-yearly results this week, with lower
copper and commodity prices expected to bite into its earnings and
analysts tipping a net pre-abnormal profit of around 369 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
During today's session, ratings agency Standard and Poor's
affirmed its short- and long-term ratings for BHP but revised the
company's outlook to negative from stable.
</P>
<P>
Toop said the troubles affecting Asian markets had raised
concerns amongst investors about the price of commodities falling
and a subsequent negative impact on resource stocks.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index fell 15.1 points to 1,041.0.
</P>
<P>
Amongst other resource stocks, global miner Rio Tinto was down
19.4 cents to 16.656 Australian dollars, and mining company WMC
was up 5.9 cents to 4.75 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Gold stocks were mixed and trading in Sydney gold bullion
closed at 283.45 Australian dollars an ounce, down 40 U.S. cents
on yesterday's close of 283.85 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index finished the day 31.9 points higher
at 4,326.7.

<P>
In the banking sector, which finished up 37.6 points at
5,267.9, National Australia Bank added 22.9 cents to 20.369
Australian dollars while ANZ bank shed 13 cents to 9.92 Australian
dollars.

<HEADLINE> China Expected to Reach Macro-Economic Control Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 15 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to reach its
macro-control target this year to achieve a steady growth in the
national economy, a statistics official has said.
</P>
<P>
judging from the major economic indices for the present, Ye
Zhen, spokesman for the State Statistics Bureau (SSB), said in an
interview with Xinhua, "In spite of the problems like inefficiency
and irrational economic structure, the Chinese economy will
maintain a rapid but appropriate growth this year as was showed in
the past eleven months."
</P>
<P>
He pointed to the bumper harvest in agriculture, steadily
growing industry, appropriate growth in the investment returns,
consumption, and export sector, effectively reined inflation, and
continual rise in urban residents' income.
</P>
<P>
The SSB spokesman said the national economy this year mainly
features a rapid but appropriate growth, with the gross domestic
product (GDP) increasing by nine percent on an annual basis during
the January-October period.
</P>
<P>
The national economy has actually achieved high growth in
tandem with low inflation, since the market prices have stablized
generally for the present, and the social consumer price index
only edged up 1.1 percent on an annual basis during the
January-October period and even dropped in October, according to
Ye.
</P>
<P>
What is noteworthy is that the Chinese industrial sector
reported increasing economic efficiency this year, with the
combined profits from the industrial ventures above the township
level rising 25.2 percent during the first ten months this year.
</P>
<P>
Another salient feature of the Chinese economy during the
period lies in a rational growth in fixed asset investment and
improved investment destination, Ye Zhen pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The fixed asset investment increased by 12.1 percent on a
yearly basis, with the input into the primary sector rising 60.9
percent over the same period last year, accounting for 2.5 percent
of the total amount, compared with the 1.8 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The basic industries like the transportation, post and
telecommunications also received 11.5 percent more of funds than
last year, while the investment in western areas saw accelerated
growth of 21.9 percent, much higher than in eastern and central
areas.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade continued to increase during the period, with the
export business forging ahead. By the end of November, the foreign
trade surplus had exceeded 35.6 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Against the backdrop of spreading financial volatility in
southeast Asian countries, China accumulated 135 billion US
dollars in foreign exchange reserve and used a total of 44 billion
US dollars of foreign investment during the first three quarters
this year, up 23.8 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
"Judging from the numerous macro-economic indices for the
present, we can say that China has basically achieved the target
set for this year and the Chinese economy as a whole has become
better than in any of the past several years," the SSB spokesman
stressed.

<P>
-- Louise Arbour, general prosecutor of the international
tribunal in the Hague in charge of judging the war crimes in
former Yugoslavia, has accused France of showing contempt to the
court by banning French officers from making testimony on war
crimes other than through written statements. She said that the
criminals sought by the court "feel safe" in the zone controlled
by French troops in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
-- The European Union (EU) summit in Luxembourg held on December
12-13 decided to start next Spring negotiations on adhesion to the
union with five central and eastern European countries -- Estonia,
Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia -- and Cyprus, thus
definitely putting an end to the division of the continent.

<HEADLINE> Freedom Movement Chief Arrested in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of Iran's
Freedom Movement Ebrahim Yazdi was arrested Sunday, a statement
from the organization announced today.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Yazdi was summoned by the Islamic
Revolutionary Court Sunday for investigations and was put into
Tehran's famous prison of Evin Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
It said that so far no official charges were announced
against Yazdi, former Iranian foreign minister of the interim
government led by late former Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan
after the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
An Iranian informed source told Xinhua through a telephone
call that Yazdi was arrested possibly on a charge of having
"illegal political activities" in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Freedom Movement was founded in 1961 by Bazargan and
fought against the former Iranian Shah regime. It joined the
first government after the Islamic Revolution but withdrew from
it due to some differences with the late Iranian Supreme
Leader Ruhollah Mosavi Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
Ebrahim Yazdi was elected as secretary general of the party
in January 1985 after Bazargan's demise. However, the party was
not granted formal permission to have activities since the
country announced to register political parties and organizations
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Yazdi announced his readiness to participate the May
presidential elections, but his candidacy was rejected by the
Iranian authorities.

<HEADLINE> Text of Jiang's Speech at Informal East Asian Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southeast Asia's financial turmoil in recent months has taught
people a profound lesson. Normal functioning of the financial
system is crucial to the overall economic stability and
development. To maintain a sound and stable financial order in a
closely intertwined global economy, it is imperative for countries
to work to improve their financial system, policy and supervision,
strengthen both regional and international financial cooperation
and jointly ward off excessive speculation by international hot
money. Only by so doing can we effectively maintain the
international financial order. Today there is a greater need to
strengthen financial cooperation in East Asia. China has taken a
positive approach towards it and is ready to take part in relevant
discussions.
</P>
<P>
Though suffering from the temporary economic difficulties
brought about by the financial turmoil, those countries in East
Asia still enjoy good economic fundamentals and other favorable
factors for economic development and will certainly advance
forward after drawing useful lessons and making necessary
readjustments. We are confident about this.
</P>
<P>
China has always attached great importance to and taken an
active part in East Asian cooperation. A key component of China's
foreign policy is to maintain good-neighborly and friendly
relations and expand mutually beneficial cooperation with our
neighbors. According to our blueprint for cross-century
development, China will accelerate the establishment of a
socialist market economy, speed up a fundamental shift of the mode
of economic growth and maintain a sustained, rapid and healthy
growth of the national economy. China will perfect its
all-dimensional, multi-tiered and wide ranging opening-up pattern,
foster an open economy and actively participate in regional
economic cooperation and global multilateral trading
system. China's economic development will provide greater
opportunities for trade, investment and cooperation in this region
and an access to a huge market. It also conduces to East Asia's
economic prosperity and stability and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
I believe that as long as we work together, people of East Asia
can certainly build a better future in the new century.

<HEADLINE> Tax Reform, Republic, Native Title is 1998 Focus for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Australian federal
government was ready to tackle a series of important policy
changes involving tax reform, the republic and native title in
1998, Prime Minister John Howard said today.
</P>
<P>
In a wide-ranging speech at a Sydney luncheon attended by about
100 ruling party faithful and some government ministers, Howard
reaffirmed his government's commitment to overhauling Australia's
tax system next year because the country's personal income tax
rates remained too high.
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a year of very important policy changes,"
Howard said.
</P>
<P>
"You can't put tax reform off forever, there's no way you can
do that," he said. "Sooner or later a government is going to have
to face the responsibility of tackling it."
</P>
<P>
The main focus for the government next year would include
holding a constitutional convention and developing a workable
model for an Australian republic, Howard said.
</P>
<P>
A constitutional convention is scheduled to take place early
next year to decide whether Australia will become a republic or
not by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
There was also the "difficult issue" of native title which has
yet to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
The Howard government struggled, but failed last month to push
through parliament a bill on native title in a bid to limit or
extinguish the right of the aboriginal people to claim the land
being used by pastoralists, miners and farmers.
</P>
<P>
The government warned that the bill, made in response to the
High Court's ruling that native title and pastoral leases could
co-exist, could eventually be used to trigger an early election by
dissolving parliament if the Senate vetoes it or heavily amends it
after it is tabled for the second time early next year.
</P>
<P>
The miners, farmers and pastoralists, who have been calling for
extinguishment of native title, and the aborigines, who have
accused the government of discriminating against them, are not
satisfied with the government's bill.
</P>
<P>
With the challenges ahead, the prime minister said: "There's an
enormous amount that's on our plate and on the agenda for the
coming year."
</P>
<P>
He said Australia's greatest achievement this year was its
success in remaining virtually unscathed by the recent Asian
currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
Howard said he was pleased that his government's policies to
promote employment were also starting to bear fruit.
</P>
<P>
"We have tried very hard to lay the proper foundations for that
and we are starting to see that some of the foundations we have
laid are starting to work."

<HEADLINE> Jiang Urges Enhanced Cooperation Among East Asian Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin Monday called for enhanced cooperation among East Asian
countries to ensure the interests of the peoples in the region and
promote peace and development of mankind.
</P>
<P>
Jiang issued the call in a speech on the first informal summit
of China, Japan, the Republic of Korea and the nine members of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations which opened here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We should intensify economic and technological cooperation,
especially hi-tech cooperation, set up a rational economic
structure in the region and bring about a non-exclusive and
non-discriminative model of economic cooperation..." Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He described the cooperation as one that can "facilitate
countries to make up for their deficiencies by drawing upon
other's advantages and strike a balance among different interests."
</P>
<P>
Jiang said East Asia in today's world is a force that cannot be
ignored politically, economically, culturally and geographically.
</P>
<P>
He said countries in the region should uphold the principles of
mutual respect, equal participation, mutual benefit and common
development in their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the countries to engage in friendly dialogues
and consultations to build up confidence, broaden agreement, seek
common ground while putting aside differences, and address
differences properly so as to ensure regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president expressed his belief that East Asian
countries can, through their own development and mutual
cooperation, provide useful experience and set a model for
economic cooperation among countries and regions in the world.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, they can also play an important role in
promoting the establishment of a just and rational new
international political and economic order of peace and stability.

ASEAN now groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar,
the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Urged to Investigate POWs Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Iranian students from Tehran
University have urged the United Nations Secretary-General Kofi
Annan to have a faster investigation into the issue of prisoners
of war (POW) of the Iran-Iraq war (1980-88).
</P>
<P>
Local daily Iran News reported today that the students made
their request in a letter to the U.N. chief. However, the
daily did not specify when the letter was delivered to Annan.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, the students appealed Annan to send special
delegation to gear up the release of Iranian POWs who are allegely
still detained in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
They accused the Iraqi government of not cooperating in
releasing Iranian POWs in Iraq despite existing documents prove
the presence of Iranian POWs in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
They said that Iran has sent different delegations to Iraq to
investigate the case of Iranian POWs but Iraq has not taken any
measures in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Tehran has claimed that about 15,000 Iranian POWs are still
kept in Iraq, but Baghdad said that there is no Iranian POWs in
Iraq but 62 detainees captured in 1991. Iraq also blamed Iran for
holding more than 18,000 Iraqi POWs.
</P>
<P>
On the sidelines of the Eighth Islamic summit held here last
week, Iraqi Vice President Yassin Ramadan reiterated Baghdad's
stance on the POWs issue, though expressing its readiness to
improve relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan held several talks with senior Iranian officials
including Iranian President Mohammad Khatami and First Vice
President Hassan Habibi, hoping that the remaining issues between
the two neighbors would be solved in the near future in order to
pave the way for normalization of bilateral ties.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Upbeat About East Asian Economies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said here Monday that the prospect for East Asia's economic
development is promising.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said this while addressing the Informal Summit Meeting of
East Asian Heads of State or Government.
</P>
<P>
He said:"Looking into the 21st century, we can say with full
confidence that relatively sound conditions are available for East
Asia to raise its economic and social development to a new level."
</P>
<P>
Over the past two or three decades, economic growth in this
region ranks the highest among the world and people's standard of
living has also improved rapidly, he added.
</P>
<P>
He cited three reasons as support for his remark.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, it is the shared desire of these countries to develop
economy.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, they have built up certain economic strength. Some
countries have entered the developed stage, others have joined the
rank of newly industrialized nations, and still others have
embarked on the road of rapid growth.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Jiang said, these countries have created their own
fine cultural traditions and the development of economic
cooperation in the region will be further boosted with a spiritual
motive force.
</P>
<P>
With all this, the regional economies can provide useful
experience and set a model for economic cooperation among
countries and regions in the world, he said.

<HEADLINE> Islamic Leader Cut Short Visit After Receiving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 15 (Xinhua) -- "The Nation of Islam" leader
 Louis Farrakhan has cut short his visit to Jerusalem and left for
Jordan after receiving death threats from Jewish extremists.
</P>
<P>
Farrakhan, also a U.S. black leader, is scheduled to hold
noon prayers today at Al-Aqsa Mosque in East Jerusalem, but
has to cut short his visit after receiving death threats from
Jewish extremists in the morning and now is on his way to
Jordan, the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) announced.
</P>
<P>
Farrakhan has caught Israeli officialdom off guard when he
showed up on Sunday at the Allenby Bridge between Jordan and
the West Bank. He was the guest of the PNA, but he told
the Israeli security officials at the border checkpoint that he
hopes to visit Israel as well.
</P>
<P>
His intended visit to Israel was met with mixed attitudes
here. Israeli Foreign Ministry on Sunday ruled out any meeting
between him and Israeli officials "as long as he adheres to
vicious and hateful language against Israel, Judaism and the
Jewish people."
</P>
<P>
Cabinet Secretary Dan Naveh took a less diplomatic course and
called on Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Interior Minister
Eli Suissa to have Farrakhan expelled at once from Israel when
he enters the country.
</P>
<P>
However, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's director of
communications David Bar-Illan said on Sunday that because
Farrakhan holds an American passport he is free to tour
Israel without hinderance.
</P>
<P>
But Farrakhan spent a busy day in the PNA territories on
Sunday. "During the Christmas season...it is my hope that this
troubled area in the world, that needs peace as much as
any part of the earth, will find peace and goodwill," he
told reporters in Ramallah before proceeding to Gaza for a
meeting with PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Arafat, he suggested that Israel is
to blame for the crisis in the peace talks and said U.S.
President Bill Clinton should apply more pressure on Israel.
</P>
<P>
"We stand firmly with the Palestinian people in its struggle
for justice...and I think the U.S. has a great role to
play...after all, billions of dollars of American tax payers'
money come to Israel each and every year and this should give
President Clinton enough leverage to insist that...the peace
process be put back on track," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Farrakhan said that people who are opposed have a right to
struggle, but added that it is unnecessary for any individual or
group to engage in any behavior that takes the lives of innocent
people for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
Farrakhan has been critical of some aspects of Jewish behavior
towards the black people and his frequent remarks disparaging
Jews and Judaism were not welcomed by Israel.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Calls for Financial Cooperation in East Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin Monday urged East Asian countries to strengthen
international and regional financial cooperation in a bid to
maintain international financial order.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the Informal Summit Meeting of East Asian
Heads of State or Government here, Jiang said it is imperative for
East Asian countries to improve their financial system, policy and
supervision and jointly ward off excessive speculation by
international hot money which caused the recent financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
He said East Asia should look squarely into the current
difficulties and obstacles in their economies such as irrational
economic structure, imperfect financial system, extensive mode of
growth, backward infrastructures and overpopulation, which need to
be addressed carefully and in real earnest.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he is confident East Asia would overcome the
economic difficulties brought about by the financial turmoil with
the good economic fundamentals and other favorable factors enjoyed
by East Asia.
</P>
<P>
China has taken a positive approach toward strengthening
financial cooperation in East Asia and is ready to take part in
relevant discussion, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
China would perfect its all-dimensional, multi-tiered and wide
ranging opening-up pattern, foster an open economy and actively
participate in regional economic cooperation and global
multilateral trading system.
</P>
<P>
Jiang says China's economic development would provide greater
opportunities for trade, investment and cooperation in this region
and an access to a huge market.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Former Defense Chief Quits Party to Bid For </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Former Philippine Defense
Secretary Renato de Villa quit the ruling party today to continue
his bid to run for president in next year's elections despite
losing President Fidel Ramos' endorsement.
</P>
<P>
"I declare a rebellion against the traditional politics of
corrupt patronage and the idea that people and their principles
can be bought," the 63-year-old retired general said at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
He also declared that he will form a third force with Manila
Mayor Alfredo Lim to compete in the presidential race in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, a joint statement issued by the two men did not
indicate the positions de Villa and Lim will respectively run for
in the presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
"Today, I clearly state my refusal to cooperate and stand on
the same platform with party leaders whose ways I cannot stomach
anymore," de Villa said in the statement, defying Ramos and the
ruling party.
</P>
<P>
De Villa's move came a week after Ramos chose Jose de Venecia,
speaker of the House of Representatives, as the presidential
candidate of the ruling Lakas-NUCD party in the 1998 national
polls.
</P>
<P>
De Villa had bitterly competed with De Venecia to win the
party's endorsement and local reports had earlier predicted that
De Villa, a close friend of Ramos, would gain the blessing of the
president.
</P>
<P>
The former defense chief said at the weekend that he would
continue his presidential bid after a provincial tour in order to
consult the people on whether they still want him to run for
president.

<HEADLINE> Text of Jiang's Speech at Informal East Asian Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Following is the full
text of Chinese President Jiang Zemin's speech, entitled "Join
Hands in Cooperation and Build A Future Together," on the informal
summit meeting of east Asian heads of state or government today:
</P>
<P>
Join Hands in Cooperation and Build A Future Together
</P>
<P>
On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the founding of
ASEAN, leaders of ASEAN countries and China, Japan and the
Republic of Korea are gathered here to discuss and explore
economic cooperation in East Asia oriented towards the 21st
century and envisage the prospect of East Asia's future
development. This is a major pioneering move. I believe that this
meeting will surely produce a far-reaching impact on furthering
East Asia's economic cooperation and building a better future
together.
</P>
<P>
In retrospect of the 20th century, profound changes and
tremendous progress have taken place in East Asia. Since modern
times, this region was once one of the regions in the world
plagued by poverty, wars and turmoils. The people of many of those
countries have suffered great misfortunes in the past. After the
end of the Second World War, people of East Asian countries,
through protracted struggle and efforts, shook off the yoke of
colonialism and won national independence one after another and
became masters of their own destiny. They have stepped onto the
world arena as equal members of the international community. They
have played a positive role in international and regional affairs
and constantly advanced their own economic development and social
progress, thus making important contributions to peace, stability
and development in Asia and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
The development and rejuvenation in the recent two or three
decades of East Asian countries, the developing countries in
particular, have opened a new chapter of Asia's historic progress
in the 20th century. Economic growth in East Asia ranks among the
highest in the world and people's standard of living has also
improved rapidly. The share of East Asia in global trade has
increased markedly. Investment environment has steadily improved,
scientific and technological level is rising year by year and
regional cooperation has been greatly accelerated. East Asia has
already become one of the regions in today's world with the most
dynamic economic growth.

<TEXT>
<P>
Looking into the 21st century, we can say with full confidence
that relatively sound conditions are available for East Asia to
raise its economic and social development to a new level.
</P>
<P>
First, it has become the shared understanding of East Asian
countries to maintain regional peace and stability, develop
economy, science and technology, expand mutually beneficial
cooperation, and promote common prosperity. East Asian countries
are committed to the development of their relations on the basis
of mutual respect, treating each other as equals and
non-interference in each other's internal affairs and properly
addressing some existing differences through friendly
consultations. With political stability, East Asian counties enjoy
good relations among themselves. This has provided an important
prerequisite for the sustained economic growth of East Asian
countries and the development of their economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Second, East Asian countries have built up certain economic
strength. Some have entered the developed stage, others have
joined the rank of newly industrialized nations, still others have
embarked on the road of rapid growth. Endowed with rich human and
natural resources, countries in this region have formulated their
development strategies in light of their actual conditions,
constantly readjusted the industrial structure, effected a shift
in the mode of growth, promoted scientific and technological
progress, and strengthened external economic exchanges. All this
has provided a broad scope for East Asian countries to engage in
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Third, the people of East Asian countries have created their
own fine cultural traditions through their prolonged practice in
history. This type of cultural traditions attaches great value to
social communities, upholds such virtues as self-respect and
self-strengthening, arduous effort, industriousness, frugality,
modesty and eagerness to learn. It advocates harmony in handling
human relations and stands for peaceful coexistence in
international relations. It constitutes a valuable spiritual
wealth. As long as East Asian countries go along with the trend of
the times and carry forward and apply those cultural traditions
and wisdom with oriental features in light of their actual
national conditions while vigorously absorbing all fruits of human
progress and civilizations, the development of economic
cooperation in East Asia will be further boosted with a spiritual
motive force.

All in all, East Asia in today's world is a force that cannot
be ignored politically, economically, culturally and
geographically. The prospect for East Asia's economic development is
promising. East Asian countries can, through their own development
and mutual cooperation, provide useful experience and set a model
for economic cooperation among countries and regions in the
world. They can also play an important role in promoting the
establishment of a just and rational new international political
and economic order of peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
When we review the past and look into the future, we realize
that it is necessary for us to further strengthen East Asian
cooperation in order to ensure the fundamental interests of East
Asian peoples and promote the lofty cause of peace and development
of the mankind. We should uphold the principles of mutual respect,

While fully recognizing the economic achievements in East Asia,
we must also look squarely into the difficulties and obstacles on
the way ahead. For instance, East Asian countries suffer, to
varying degrees, from irrational economic structure, imperfect
financial system, extensive mode of growth, backward
infrastructures and enormous pressure brought about by
over-population and environmental control. These problems need to
be addressed carefully and in real earnest.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Expresses Regret over Former Defense Chief's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos today asked former Defense Secretary Renato de Villa to
reconsider his decision to bolt from the ruling Lakas-NUCD party
and pursue his bid for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
Ramos also belittled De Villa's chances of winning in next
year's elections without his backing and the machinery of the
ruling party, a statement released by the Presidential Palace
said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos' statement came after De Villa's announcement earlier
today that he quit the ruling party to pursue his bid for the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
Ramos last week chose Jose de Venecia, Speaker of the House of
Representatives, as the man who will carry the ruling party's
banner in the May 11, 1998 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
De Villa, who joined the ruling party just four months ago, had
bitterly competed with De Venecia to win the president's blessing.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that Rene de Villa and his followers will reexamine
their position in the light of their participation in and
commitments to the party's political processes and as well as the
chances of their success outside the administration party," said
Ramos, who is currently in Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
Ramos expressed "regret" over the former defense secretary's
decision to run for president outside the ruling party because he
regards De Villa as a "man of integrity whose support is an asset
to the Lakas-NUCD", the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, De Venecia also issued a statement on the decision
of De Villa to bolt out of the ruling party, saying "We are
keeping the door of reconciliation open to former Defense
Secretary Renato de Villa and his dwindling band of supporters."

<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen on China-ASEAN Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen today expressed his satisfaction over
the relations between China and ASEAN nations and between China
and ASEAN as an organization, saying the relations have made
significant progress in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at a business forum titled "A Private
Sector Salute to ASEAN" here this afternoon, Qian mentioned that
since China became a full dialogue partner of ASEAN last year,
"China-ASEAN relations have reached a new level".
</P>
<P>
He said, "Through frequent political exchanges, steadily
expanding economic cooperation and trade and candid dialogue and
consultations, we have enhanced mutual understanding, deepened
trust, broadened common ground and increased friendship."
</P>
<P>
Facts have shown that China and ASEAN are important forces for
peace and development, stability and cooperation, he said, adding
that maintaining friendly relations and cooperation between China
and ASEAN serves the interests of both sides and also brings
benefits to the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Qian also spoke highly of ASEAN's positive role in keeping with
its unique approach in safeguarding peace, promoting development
and strengthening cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We have noted with pleasure that over the past three
decades, especially since the beginning of the 1990s, ASEAN
countries have worked unremittingly for national and regional
resilience and achieved remarkable success."
</P>
<P>
In the course of its development, ASEAN has initiated the
famous ASEAN Way, which highlights non-interference in the
internal affairs of countries, respects diversity, stresses equal
participation, pursues consensus through consultations, cherishes
mutually beneficial cooperation and stands for incremental
progress, he said.
</P>
<P>
Following this approach, ASEAN has withstood numerous tests, he
added.

<HEADLINE> China's Tax Revenue Tops 666 Billion Yuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 15 (Xinhua) -- China collected a total of
61.457 billion yuan in industrial and commercial tax in November,
up 14 percent, or 7.569 billion yuan from the same 1996 period,
according to the State Administration of Taxation.
</P>
<P>
Another two major tax items under the new tax regime, the
value-added tax and consumption tax, posted an increase of 10.1
percent to reach 34.948 billion yuan last month.
</P>
<P>
In another analysis, the state tax revenue during the past
eleven months totaled 666.087 billion yuan, up 18.1 percent,
or 102.21 billion yuan over the same 1996 period, meeting 95.8
percent of the annual tax collection target.
</P>
<P>
With the stamp tax on stock trading and the business tax on the
financial sector adjusted from the total amount, the revenue
increase stood at 15.1 percent, higher than the national economic
growth of about nine percent.
</P>
<P>
The revenue of business tax, income tax from the private
sector and overseas-funded ventures, and stamp tax have all
overfulfilled the yearly targets.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the individual income tax surged 36 percent on a
yearly basis to 23.259 billion yuan during the period, meeting
96.9 percent of annual target.
</P>
<P>
The value-added tax and consumption tax, on the other hand,
amounted to 352.374 billion yuan during the eleven-month period,
up 10.8 percent on a yearly basis, compared to the targeted 19.3
percent of annual growth.
</P>
<P>
State taxation officials also pointed out that tax in arrears
still pose a serious problem, and at the end of November, the
value-added tax and consumption tax in default accounted for 73.2
percent of the total.

<HEADLINE> Russian PM Arrives on Official Visit to Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin arrived here today for an official visit to Turkey to
enhance bilateral ties, including realizing multi-billion gas deal
plans and seeking a solution to the disputed straits.
</P>
<P>
The long-expected visit of Chernomyrdin came ahead of his
Turkish counterpart Mesut Yilmaz's forthcoming trip this week to
the United States after Turkey, an associate member of the
European Union (EU), was excluded Friday from the EU enlargement
process in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day visit, Chernomyrdin is expected to submit
Russia's request for Turkey to make some changes to the rules in
respects of traffic in the Turkish straits, the Bosphorus and the
Dardanelles.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Chernomyrdin said in Moscow Saturday that
Russia has been objecting to the Turkish self-policy of arranging
and implementing the rules for the straits.
</P>
<P>
The rules have already violated the Montreaux Straits Agreement
signed between Turkey and the former Soviet Union in 1936, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moscow has long been opposing Turkey's limiting the number of
ships carrying oil through the straits in Turkey linking Asian
and European continents.
</P>
<P>
Turkey claims that if a huge number of oil tankers are allowed to
pass through these waterways, this will increase the possibility
of dangerous explosions in and around Istanbul, the largest city
of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Russian and Turkish prime ministers will also discuss some
important issues, including the controversial 150 kilometer-range
S-300 missiles, which are planned to be sold to Cyprus by Moscow.
</P>
<P>
They are expected to hold talks on the controversial
Turkish-Russian natural gas deal -- the transportation of 16
billion cubic meters of Russian gas through an undersea pipeline
to pass via the Black Sea.

HEFEI, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Jiuhua Mountain, one of the four
Buddhist shrines in China, has attracted over three million
Chinese and overseas tourists and pilgrims so far this year.
</P>

It became even more well-known after Li Bai, a noted Chinese
poet of the Tang Dynasty (618-907) had written over 50 poems in

<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen on New Security Concept </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier Qian
Qichen said here today that if lasting peace is to be secured, it
is imperative to cultivate a new security concept and seek new
ways of maintaining peace.
</P>
<P>
"The security concept and the security regime of the Cold War
era, based on military alliances with ever escalating armament,
are in our view incapable of making peace," Qian noted.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who is also China's foreign minister, made the remarks in
a speech delivered at a business forum titled "A Private Sector
Salute to ASEAN" here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"Expanding military blocs run counter to the trend of the
times," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
He outlined the following points to explain the new security
concept and new ways of maintaining peace:
</P>
<P>
-- State-to-state relations should be based on the five
principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial
integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in each other's
internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful
coexistence.
</P>
<P>
"This is the political basis and prerequisite for regional and
global security. In this regard, the cultivation of healthy and
stable relations among the world's major powers is crucial to
peace and security at both regional and global levels," he said.
</P>
<P>
-- Countries should step up mutually beneficial cooperation and
mutual opening-up in the economic sphere, do away with inequality
and discriminatory policies in economic and trade relations, and
pursue common prosperity by gradually narrowing the development
gap between nations.
</P>
<P>
The recent financial turmoil in Southeast Asia shows that
economic security is an important component of stability and
development, he said.
</P>
<P>
"To maintain a normal economic and financial order requires not
only a sound macro-economic management regime and a sound
financial system, but also greater regional and global financial
cooperation, concerted efforts to ward off the speculative attacks
by international hot money and creation of a stable and secure
external economic environment," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
-- Countries should enhance mutual understanding and trust
through dialogue and cooperation and undertake to resolve their
differences or disputes by peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
This is the practical way of ensuring peace and security, he
said. "Security dialogue and cooperation should be aimed at
increasing trust instead of creating confrontation. It must not
be allowed to target at any third country, nor undermine the
security interest of other countries," he added.

benefited from the bank's international service, while the

<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen Stresses Peace for Economic Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said here today that securer peace is
the precondition for economic development.
</P>
<P>
"Standing at the threshold of a new century, we can see quite
clearly that peace, development, stability and cooperation have
come to form the mainstream of our times," Qian said at a business
forum titled "A Private Sector Salute to ASEAN" here this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"Without peace, there can be no development to speak of," said
Qian, who is accompanying Chinese President Jiang Zemin to the
East Asian informal summit which began here today.
</P>
<P>
The rapid economic development in the Asia-Pacific, East Asia
in particular, owes itself mainly to the absence of any threat of
war as countries in the region have shown increasingly keen
political will to settle their disputes peacefully, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that a favorable situation characterized by mutual
reinforcement between political stability and economic development
has taken shape by and large in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that shared interests and interdependence in the
economic field have promoted dialogue and cooperation among
nations and economic links and mutually-beneficial cooperation
have intertwined to form a network making for peace and security.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese foreign minister agreed with Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir's view that national security is inseparable
from political stability, economic success and social harmony.

<HEADLINE>   Foreign Illegal Immigrants Forced to Leave Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 15 (Xinhua) -- About 5,000 foreign
illegal immigrants have left Kuwait and 10,000 regularized their
residence status during a two-and-half-month grace period ending
today, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait Interior Ministry started the amnesty period at the
beginning of October, demanding the illegals to leave the country
within the period without paying fines.
</P>
<P>
During the period, Kuwait Interior Ministry increased
inspections in areas where they suspected that illegal foreign
residents were staying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor has
been checking on the residence status of students in various
private schools.
</P>
<P>
Students of private schools were given until December 13
this month to show a copy of their valid civil identity
cards to their schools, or they would be suspended.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's campaign to clean illegal foreign residents was within
the framework of a common effort in the Gulf Arab countries to
clear illegal expatriates. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates
and Oman also carried out similar campaigns earlier this year
during which deferent amnesty period were granted to illegal
aliens to leave without punishment.
</P>
<P>
About 1.3 million foreign laborers and their families are
living in Kuwait, accounting for 65 percent of its 2 million
population. Illegal foreign laborers are marginal comparing with
that in other Gulf countries.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Economy Shows Signs of Revival: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Finance Minister
Sartaj Aziz has said that the country's economy is showing signs
of revival owing to the economic reforms made by the government
and is expected to achieve a growth rate of six percent in the
current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
"The business confidence has been restored, fiscal and
financial discipline has improved," said Sartaj Aziz while
inaugurating the Annual General Meeting of the Pakistan Society of
Development Economists (PSDE) here today.
</P>
<P>
The revival of economic growth is based on larger mobilization
of domestic resources, he said, adding, "The soft option of
borrowing rather than mobilizing tax revenues cannot continue for
very long."
</P>
<P>
The fiscal policy, he said, will be used as an instrument of
economic and social development to ensure wider and equitable
dispersal of the gains of development.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for continuous improvement in productivity
and efficient use of human and material resources.

<HEADLINE> China's Yuan Unaffected by Currency Turmoils  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese yuan is widely
expected to remain stable next year despite recent currency
turmoils in some countries in Southeast and East Asia, officials
and experts said.
</P>
<P>
"China's foreign exchange supply will continue to exceed demand
at the domestic market next year, indicating that the yuan's
stable exchange rate will continue," an official of the State
Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) said.
</P>
<P>
The country's good foreign trade situation, a large influx of
foreign capital and general expectation of a strong economy will
be the fundamental factors for the stable yuan, Tao Liming,
director of the International Finance Research Institute of the
Bank of China, told Xinhua in an interview.
</P>
<P>
Tao said that China will continue to enjoy a trade surplus in
1998, though the favorable balance will not be as big as that of
this year.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that China had a trade surplus of 40.2
billion US dollars in the first 11 months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Tao acknowledged that the significant currency devaluation in a
number of Asian countries, including Thailand, the Philippines,
Indonesia and the Republic of Korea, will affect China's export of
labor intensive products such as shoes and garments in some
respects.
</P>
<P>
"But the impact will not be so great as to affect China's
overall trade balance," he said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the continuous implementation of a moderately
tight fiscal and monetary policy means that imports will not surge
in 1998.

<P>
"When factors affecting the trade balance are considered, China
will continue to enjoy a trade surplus, though not as large as
that of this year," Tao said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that foreign capital inflow into China will slow
down next year as investors will be more cautious in making
investment in Asia-Pacific countries as a result of the recent
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
But due to the attractiveness of the Chinese market and
prospective dynamic Chinese economy, the absolute amount of
capital inflow into China will remain at a considerable level next
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, China's balance of international payments will
continue to be good next year, which guarantees a stable rate of
the yuan, Tao said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China's huge foreign exchange reserves, at 134
billion US dollars at the end of September, are a powerful support
for the stability of the yuan.
</P>
<P>
The SAFE official said that currency turbulence in the region
will not have any significant impact on the stability of the
yuan's value.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese yuan has been consolidating against major western
currencies since China unified its exchange rate in 1994. It
gained 0.3 percent against the US dollar last year, following
rises of 2.9 and 1.5 percent in 1994 and 1995, respectively. This
year it has been under constant pressure for appreciation.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Boasts Promising Prospects of Geothermal Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Yangbajain Geothermal Power
Station in the Tibet Autonomous Region, the biggest of its kind in
China, has been operating well over the past 20 years and
contributed much to the local economy.
</P>
<P>
Since its first generating unit was launched into operation in
1977, the station has generated 1.1 billion kwh of electricity,
which accounted for about 45 percent of the electricity in the
Lhasa power network.
</P>
<P>
Yang Guangjiu, director of the station, said the geothermal
pressures in the current ten wells are dwindling after 20 years
of exploitation, but geothermal resources in deeper layers are
rather abundant.
</P>
<P>
A 1,000-meter well dugged out recently is able to gush out hot
water of 205 degrees Celsius, and it is the best geothermal well
in China. The hot gas from this well only can drive all the current
generating units, the director said.
</P>
<P>
"It shows that geothermal resources between 800 to 1,500 meters
underground are of great quality and quantity, and bigger
generating untis can be installed," he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the health-promotion function of geothermal water
is attracting more people, and the sulphur-rich water is suitable
for detergent production, wool spinning and weaving, and pottery
making, the director said.

<HEADLINE> Nurses' Strike Enters 17th Day in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The situation in Kenya's
health sector remained grim with nurses in public hospitals
continuing their nationwide strike for the 17th day Sunday, local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Many patients were unattended while some hospitals remained
closed, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The nurses launched the strike on November 28 to seek for up
to 500 percent pay rise. The Ministry of Health has dismissed the
demands as unrealistic, saying they outstripped its budget.
</P>
<P>
At the Kenyatta National Hospital, the biggest public hospital
in the capital city of Nairobi, doctors were busy attending to a
large number of patients at the casualty and the emergency units.
</P>
<P>
One of the doctors there said the hospital had recently
recruited more medical personnel to help cope with the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"But the situation remains grim as the work is just too much
and they seem to be untrained," said the doctor.
</P>
<P>
In Nyeri in central Kenya, a middle-aged woman gave birth at a
bus station after she was turned away from the provincial general
hospital.
</P>
<P>
In Kisumu, the third-largest city in Kenya, the New Nyanza
General Hospital and the Kisumu District hospital were empty. All
the hospital gates remained locked as in-patients and
out-patients were turned away.
</P>
<P>
As the sick and the injured continue suffering, the
government, under more and more criticism for being "curiously
slow" in attempts to end the strike, has been urged to hold
negotiations with the nurses as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Inter-Party Talks to Continue, Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's ruling party has said
the proposed inter-party dialogue will go ahead even without
opposition leaders like former Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia today quoted Michael Sata, national secretary
of the Movement for Multi-party Democracy (MMD) as saying here
Sunday that Kaunda is not a party and his absence will not be
allowed to affect the time-table for the crucial talks.
</P>
<P>
Sata was reacting to a statement issued by Kaunda's United
National Independence Party (UNIP) last week that Kaunda will
attend the inter-party talks scheduled for next month if the
government guarantees his safe return from a marathon overseas
trip.
</P>
<P>
He said that Kaunda, who went abroad on the eve of the October
28 coup attempt, did not seek permission from anyone when leaving
the country and why he is now making his return an issue when the
agenda for the talks has already been set.
</P>
<P>
"If Kaunda does not want to attend the talks, we shall still
go ahead with the dialogue because he is not a political party.
We will stick by our program and will not wait for any president
who is not ready," Sata said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he rejected the inclusion of independent parliament
members into the dialogue, saying the talks are strictly for
representatives of political parties and independent candidates
merely represent their own opinions not anybody else's.
</P>
<P>
Two independent members have protested against being left out
of the dialogue initiative, arguing that it is unacceptable for
the government to exclude the 10 MPs.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Strengthens Pollution Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's largest
industrial city, will strengthen its efforts in controlling the
city's water, air and noise pollution next year, said Lu Shuping,
director of Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that the city's main pollution includes contaminated
water, car exhausts, and traffic noise.
</P>
<P>
The city aims to clear up the Suzhou River, running through the
urban area, reducing the daily release of waste water by 21,400
tons. The city also prohibits the construction of new fertilizer,
printing and electroplating plants in the suburban areas.
</P>
<P>
According to Lu, the city's daily capacity of sewage disposal
has reached 220 tons.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 percent of the city's residents are using coal
gas. And the city will build another five liquefied natural gas
filling stations, encouraging cars using gas instead of petroleum.
</P>
<P>
The city will also increase their public green areas by 300
hectares, and build three new parks.
</P>
<P>
So far, the city's green coverage has reached 17.8 percent, up
0.8 percentage point compared with last year. And the city's
average public green area have increased by 0.4 square meter to
2.3 square meters.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Coffee Exports in Modest Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Uganda coffee exports were in
modest recovery in November, the Uganda Coffee Development
Authority (UCDA) said in its monthly report.
</P>
<P>
Uganda exported 179,604 bags (60 kg for each bag) of coffee
worth of 16 million U.S. dollars last month, bringing a 37
percent increase in the quantity and 32 percent in the value,
comparing to the exports of 130,829 bags in October which worth
12 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Culminative coffee exports for October and September, the
first two months of the 1997-1998 coffee year, stood at 310,433
bags worth of 28 million dollars, while the country exported
792,839 bags of coffee worth of 62.9 million dollars during the
same period in last coffee year.
</P>
<P>
The UCDA report attributed the decrease this year in coffee
export to the El Nino phenomena. The extensive drought resulted
in the poor growth of coffee plants, and the prolonged rains in
the country in recent three months have delayed the harvest and
halted the trading.
</P>
<P>
The floods have made the movement of coffee trucks in coffee
areas impossible, and the coffee season may be delayed to April
1998, two months longer than the usual year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Coffee is the main export product for Uganda. It earns 65
percent of the country's foreign exchange.

<HEADLINE> Auto Rental Business In China Running Into Difficulties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, December 15 (Xinhua) -- In spite of its increasing
popularity, the auto rental business in Fuzhou, the capital of
China's Fujian Province, still has a way to go.
</P>
<P>
The first auto rental agency opened in April, 1994, and the
service has grown more popular among the people of Fuzhou,
especially young professionals, who can afford the 300 to 400 yuan
per day for business trips and outings. The city's three agencies
have nearly 200 buses, vans, and cars, 80 percent of which are
rented on weekdays. On weekends and holidays, almost all are
reserved by customers.
</P>
<P>
But, the three renters have made very little profit in the
flourishing business. According to senior managers, it is hard for
the agencies to buy more automobiles because banks do not have a
mortgage loan policy for automobiles, and car manufacturers do not
finance auto purchases.
</P>
<P>
And, the auto leasers pay the same fees as taxi companies but
can't do similar business. They also have to take into account
confiscation of automobiles if they are used for illegal
activities into, and other risks.
</P>
<P>
One private businessman involved in the cosmetics business who
has spent 98,000 yuan for nearly 300 days of car use this year,
who was about to renew the rental contract for next year, said
that a rented car has many advantages. He has much less money tied
up and can get a new model easily. But, what is more important, he
doesn't have to worry about things like license plates,
maintenance, an annual inspection, and taxes.
</P>
<P>
But, even if there is a strong demand for cars, the rental
business is not something that is going to develop in a short
period of time, according to one agency's manager.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Transportation Difficult as Heavy Rains Lash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzania Road
Tanker's Association (TAROTA) has suspended the transportation of
fuel to the Lake Victoria region and neighboring Rwanda and the
Republic of Congo because a 10-km road section in the west Tabora
Region has been damaged by floods.
</P>
<P>
Floods have damaged the road between Igunga and Nzega, washing
away the Ulyang'ombe bridge on the road last weekend as heavy
rains continued falling in Igunga District, "The Guardian" said
today.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,600 people have been made homeless in the district, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
TAROTA Chairman Faisal Awadh said here on Sunday that about
150 transit fuel tankers have been stranded in Tabora for the
past two weeks because the heavy rains have made the road
impassable.
</P>
<P>
Awadh called on the government to repair the road stretch
immediately. "It is difficult to use the road even on foot,"
observed Awadh, whose association is responsible for
transportation of fuel to different upcountry destinations and
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
It is feared that by the end of this week the Mwanza Airport
and other major facilities will start experiencing fuel shortage.
</P>
<P>
However, the TAROTA chairman commended the government for
taking measures to control fuel smuggling by unscrupulous dealers
from Kisumu in Kenya through Lake Victoria to Mwanza.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Speeds Up Telecommunications Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Autonomous Region is
accelerating development of its telecommunications services by
using foreign and domestic loans.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, two major telecommunications programs were completed
and went into operation in Lhasa City, capital of the region, and
other three cities and prefectures.
</P>
<P>
One of the programs involved a 4.77 million U.S. dollar loan
from the Australian government to construct a program-controlled
telephone system with 30,000 lines in the west section of Lhasa
City.
</P>
<P>
The other program is to update satellite telecommunication
equipment in four cities and prefectures -- Lhasa, Nyingchi, Qamdo
and Ngari -- by using a mixed loan of 8.85 million U.S. dollars
from the Canadian government.
</P>
<P>
According to the Tibet Telecommunications Administration, the
region has used another batch of loans of 7.5 million dollars to
introduce 25 micro-wave controlled telephone systems.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Zhongyi, director of the administration, said that so far
construction of 10 systems has been completed, which made 107
townships connected with the region's telecommunications networks.
</P>
<P>
The region is now using a mixed loan of five million
U.S. dollars from the Canadian government and 60 million yuan from
domestic banks in the region and the Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications to update telecommunication equipment in Lhasa
City as well as Xigaze and Shannan prefectures.

<HEADLINE> Village Doctors Take Care of Farmers in Remote Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Even in the most remote part
of southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, farmers are
able to consult doctors in their own villages when they sick,
local health sources said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 95 percent of the region's 14,756 villages
have their own doctors.
</P>
<P>
The two or three doctors in each of the villages are
responsible for treatment of common diseases, epidemic prevention
and health care for women and children.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-eight-year-old Yi Wenhui heads a clinic in Qingshui
village in Hepu county. A graduate from the Guangxi College of
Traditional Chinese Medicine, Yi said that all the four doctors of
the clinic have a degree from a secondary medical school or above,
and licenses issued by the county health department.
</P>
<P>
"The county health department sponsors regular training courses
to improve our medical skills," Yi noted.
</P>
<P>
The courses include bimonthly meetings for doctors to exchange
their views on how to prevent and treat common diseases, according
 to local conditions, and annual courses for the doctors to
further improve their medical skills.
</P>
<P>
The village clinic doctors offer 24-hour service a day, said
villager Chen Chengji.
</P>
<P>
"Without the village clinic," he said, "we have to cycle for an
hour to the township clinic in case we are sick, and it will take
at least half a day for one to visit the doctor."
</P>
<P>
Dr. Yi is quite confident of his medical skill. "The villagers
always come to us first when they are ill, and we can treat most
of the common diseases," he said, adding that the village doctors
seldom send patients to larger hospitals.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Nepal's Political Instability Hurts Economic  Development  by Yi Aijun, Chen Anning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Political instability in
Nepal, one of the poorest countries in the world, has affected the
country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
The Himalayan kingdom has seen seven governments in power since
1990.
</P>
<P>
After a hung parliament emerged in the mid-term elections in
November 1994, things became even more tricky in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Since no single party commands a simple majority in the
parliament, Nepal's coalition politics has been marred by
struggles over petty interests which drove parties to change
partners frequently.
</P>
<P>
Three coalition governments have been born in the past three
years in Nepal, two in this year alone.
</P>
<P>
Frequent government changes affect Nepal's economic development
in many ways, said Dr. Kishor Kumar Guru-Gharana of the National
Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
Political instability causes policy instability, which in turn
leads to macro-economic instability, he explained.
</P>
<P>
He said as the system in Nepal is still a highly centralized
one, every time political instability happens, government
officials have to wait until the situation becomes clear.
</P>
<P>
And every time there is a change of government, not only the
prime minister and ministers, but also the secretaries, project
directors and engineers are changed. All of them have to take time
to study new things and all these delay decision-making, he said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, 90 percent of the country's projects and programs
have been affected. And on the average, there is a delay of two
years in the implementation of the projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This affects foreign investment as well as domestic
investment," said Dr. Guru-Gharana.
</P>
<P>
According to a world investment report, Nepal gets only 2
million U.S. dollars of investment every year.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, Nepal's economic situation has been very
discouraging, the U.S.-trained economist said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, Nepal's annual economic growth has been low
at 4.5 percent in recent years, and exports have been declining,
including carpet and garment, the country's major foreign exchange
earners.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, imports are growing at a slower pace than before.
"In other countries, this is a good sign. But in Nepal, not good.
Because most of our industries are based on imported raw
materials, machinery and petroleum products. It means the economy
is slack, and the industries are slack," the economist said.
</P>
<P>
Sluggish imports lead to reduction of tax revenue, which is
based heavily on imports, he said.
</P>
<P>
Many Nepalese have become tired of the political antics in the
country and said they wanted the country to be put on the right
track of economic development, as 45 percent of the country's
population of 21.6 million are still living below the poverty
line.

<HEADLINE> Science Getting Greater Role In China's Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 15 (Xinhua) -- China will place greater
importance on science and technology in agriculture because the
farmland acreage and water resources per capita are much lower
than the world's average, according to an article in today's
"People's Daily".
</P>
<P>
The article by the Ministry of Agriculture says that China's
population will be 1.6 billion by the year 2030, and that,
figuring 400 kg of grain for each person annually, the country
will need an annual grain output of 640 million tons. That means a
net increase of 150 million tons in next three decades.
</P>
<P>
The past has shown, both in China and in other parts of the
world, that agronomy can bring great changes in farm production,
and there will be better seed breeding, use of resources, farm
tools, and bio-technology by the year 2010. By the middle of next
century, China's farm production will be much more modernized, it
says.
</P>
<P>
Although China cut the acreage of land sown in grain crops by
10 million ha through scientific farming, the country's total
grain output rose from 300 million tons in 1978 to 490 million
tons last year as a result of agro-technology.

<HEADLINE> Richer Rural Households In China Now Investing In Water Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Some of the richer families in
rural parts of China have begun to invest in water control
projects for development and to help the needy as well, because
they have enough thanks to the country's reforms.
</P>
<P>
Jinzhong Prefecture in Shanxi Province, in the north, is one of
these places. Its policies encourage farmers to put their money in
water conservation projects, so that whoever spends will benefit
from the project. The local government also provides subsidies for
large-scale, high-efficiency projects, and floating prices for
water for investors.
</P>
<P>
About 200 households in the prefecture have spent 32 million
yuan in all on eight water diversion projects and four water
saving and supply projects. These have helped the improvement of
200 ha of medium- and low-yield farmland and the development of
2,200 ha of irrigated farmland.
</P>
<P>
Yan Jiusan, of Pingyao County, spent 140,000 yuan on a well
to improve 10 ha of arid land, which he has turned into an
orchard. Yan also helps irrigate more than 70 ha of land for other
villagers.
</P>
<P>
Gui Gairun, of Shouyang County, has worked hard on 220 ha. of
hilly wasteland over the past decade, and put more than 100,000
yuan into planting 150 ha. of shelterbelt.
</P>
<P>
Next, rich families that were not involved in agriculture began
to follow suit. Cao Yishang, of Jiexiu city, who made his money in
the coke business, invested 900,000 yuan in shoreland along the
Fenhe River where he plans to spend 15 million yuan on a large
water storage project to ease the water shortage problems.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Joining Hands With HK in Oil Exploration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Xinjiang
Petroleum Administration has been cooperating fruitfully with a
Hong Kong company in jointly exploring petroleum resources in
Junggar Basin since September of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The two companies have successfully sunk 540 oil wells this
year, which will be able to produce 625,000 tons of crude oil,
according to local sources.
</P>
<P>
In September 1996, Xinjiang Petroleum Administration signed a
contract with China (Hong Kong) Oil Co. Ltd. for establishing
Xinjiang-HK Petroleum Cooperative Development Company which will be
responsible for a joint exploration of two thick oil structures
situated on northwestern border of the Junggar Basin.
</P>
<P>
The new company, with a registered capital of over one billion
yuan, is the first share-holding company engaged in oil
development in Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang Petroleum Administration set aside 480 million yuan on
the cooperative venture, while the Hong Kong partner pumped in 66
million U.S. dollars (about 548 million yuan).
</P>
<P>
According to a signed agreement, all the oil produced by the
joint venture will be purchased by Xinjiang Petroleum
Administration in line with existing market prices and the profits
will be divided by proportions.
</P>
<P>
Yang Ruiqi, a senior researcher with Xinjiang Petroleum
Research Institute, said the northwestern border of the Junggar
Basin is home to one billion thick oil resources, but currently,
the verified geological thick oil reserves in the region only
stands at 200 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The two thick oil structures Xinjiang and Hong Kong have been
cooperating on are rich in oil reserves which are not buried deep,
therefore cost for sinking wells will be comparatively low. The
joint venture has so far formed production capacity.
</P>
<P>
Thick oil exploration in Junggar Basin only has a history of
more than ten years, but a complete set of thick oil exploring
technology from geological research, oil exploring techniques and
ground treatment has been formed.
</P>
<P>
The application of high-pressure steam to the oil-bearing
strata has greatly enhanced thick oil output. Junggar Basin is
expected to produce 1.93 million tons of thick oil this year,
accounting for a quarter of China's total output.

<HEADLINE> Southern China's Private Sector Assists State Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Private businesses in the
capital of south China's Guangdong Province have been playing a
positive role in State-owned enterprise reforms.
</P>
<P>
They are co-operating mainly in purchasing companies and buying
shares, and are injecting some vitality into lack-luster
state-owned firms.
</P>
<P>
One privately-owned company rejuvenated the Guangzhou
Fireproofing Plant, which was on the verge of bankruptcy, by
buying it for 13 million yuan (1.57 million US dollars). Another
private firm purchased an air-conditioner plant for 95 million
yuan (11.45 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Some private businesses support State-owned companies that are
short of funds by purchasing idle State-owned fixed assets. The
Jinxiang Industrial Co. bought a 600 sq.m. workshop from a
State-owned plant for three million yuan (361,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Buying shares has also been proven effective. The Huangpu Port
Development Co., which had a handling capacity of only 7,000
containers in 1996, expanded its operations when 40 million yuan
(4.8 million US dollars) of its shares were bought by a local
private firm.
</P>
<P>
The area of Huangpu Port has increased from 18,000 sq.m. to
100,000 sq.m. and the annual handling capacity has risen to 40,000
containers.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Urbanites Learn How To Find Jobs From Rural Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese state statistics show
that 35.91 million farmers, equivalent to the number of workers
expected to be laid off in cities from 1991 to 2000, have found
jobs in cities, today's People's Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
Most people living in urban areas experience some inconvenience
when those rural laborers temporarily leave their posts in large
numbers, especially during the Spring Festival when they go back
home to reunite with their families.
</P>
<P>
These laborers have taken the jobs of city people, but the
truth is that most of those former farmers are doing the dirtiest
and most tiresome jobs that urbanites extremely dislike, such as
physical labor, selling vegetables, construction work, and street
food vending.
</P>
<P>
And, those 35 million workers earned a total of 197.3 billion
yuan, or nearly 24 billion US dollars, from that hard menial work,
according to statistics.
</P>
<P>
"The factory where I worked paid me only 300 yuan a month, but
I could knit sweaters during working hours," one person explained,
"but now, a 600-yuan job requires much harder work, and I feel
that it just isn't worth it."
</P>
<P>
Some big cities have restrictions on hiring rural laborers. But
the key to dealing with unemployed urbanites, the news story says,
lies in changing their attitudes.
</P>
<P>
Many laid-off workers in Shanghai have looked for work as
part-time domestic help or nurses, jobs that were formerly
regarded as suitable for rural laborers only, and, the news story
goes on to say, urban workers should learn from their rural
counterparts in looking for work.
</P>
<P>
"Some Beijing people are lazy, but they're willing to part with
their money, we can earn over 200 yuan a day by washing six range
hoods for them," say two farmer-workers from Sichuan, who describe
how they even collected scrap after arriving in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The 35 million rural laborers had to look for work in urban
environments they were completely unfamiliar with, and urban
residents must learn how to find a way out as the country
restructures its economy.

<HEADLINE> Year-ender: Peace Still Keynote in West Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 15 (Xinhua) -- For west Africa, the most
important thing worth celebrating this year is the restoration of
peace in Liberia, a historical victory that people all over the
sub-region hope to bring an enabling environment for economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Then there came an event of similar importance but with
adverse effect.
</P>
<P>
It was the military coup in Sierra Leone which took place as
the Liberian peace process was approaching its end, and this coup
once again exposed the sub-region to chaos both politically and
economically.
</P>
<P>
West African countries, over the past seven years or more,
have been deeply upset by the bloody civil war in Liberia, which
not only destroyed the country, but also threw the entire
sub-region in its shadow.
</P>
<P>
Billions of U.S. Dollars and tens of thousands of troops under
the aegis of ECOMOG, the peace-keeping force of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS), have been put into
Liberia by its peace-loving neighbors and their painstaking
efforts have finally borne the desired fruit.
</P>
<P>
With the assistance of ECOWAS and the international community
as a whole, and under the monitoring of ECOMOG, a successful
election in August this year produced the country's post-war
government led by President Charles Taylor.
</P>
<P>
Peace returned at long last as a milestone in the history of
Liberia after seven years of nightmare, during which more than
150,000 people were killed and about 800,000 others fled to
neighboring countries for refuge.
</P>
<P>
However, it still seems early for both the leaders and the
people of west African countries to be jubilant over the
returning peace and normalcy in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Only eight weeks before Liberia's first post-war election,
rebellious soldiers in neighboring Sierra Leone launched a coup
and ousted the 14-month-old civilian government of President
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
The May 25 coup aroused condemnation from the international
community. The United Nations and ECOWAS have both imposed
sanctions against the country as a means to force the ruling
military junta to step down.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were accompanied by a series of negotiations
during which the junta finally agreed to hand over power to
President Kabbah in April next year.
</P>
<P>
However, as consensus has yet been reached on certain critical
issues for the hand-overr, observers doubted if the peace process
in Sierra Leone could proceed smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Despite the Sierra Leonean crisis, everyone is convinced that
owing to the collective efforts by ECOWAS member states, the
situation in west Africa as a whole is moving toward stability.
</P>
<P>
It is especially so when taking into consideration the
achievements in Liberia and the improvement in the relations
between Ghana and Burkina Faso which had been frozen for 10
years.
</P>
<P>
The protocol signed earlier this month between the government
of Niger and its opposition on the implementation of a peace
accord and the calmness at the Nigeria-Cameroun border also
contribute to the situation.
</P>
<P>
All this will help create an environment favorable for west
African countries to boost economic development.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, west African countries have never given
up their effort on economic development despite instability in
the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics provided by the ECOWAS secretariat,
economy in the sub-region started to grow in 1993, with the
growth rate moving up to 2.8 percent in 1994 and four percent in
1995, which was higher than the three-percent population growth
rate.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the sub-region recorded an economic growth rate as
high as 4.3 percent, and similar achievement is expected this
year as a result of good weather conditions and the redoubled
efforts by various countries in restructuring the economy as well
as increasing foreign investment.

<HEADLINE> Year-ender: Peace Still Keynote in West Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
However, as analysts pointed out, the real economic take-off
in west Africa as a whole depends, to a large extent, on the good
performance of ECOWAS, a 16-member sub-regional body set up 22
years ago with an ambition of economic integration through joint
efforts and solidarity.
</P>
<P>
To build a sub-regional bloc similar to the European Union,
ECOWAS members have adopted such impressive programs as
harmonization of national macro-economic policies, establishment
of a single monetary zone and trade liberalization scheme.
</P>
<P>
The programs also include regional infrastructural networks,
gas project, inter-connection of national electric grids,
regional environmental protection and food security.
</P>
<P>
Previous efforts in carrying out these community schemes have
led to significant achievements.
</P>
<P>
According to ECOWAS Executive Secretary Lansana Kouyate,
customs regulations and formalities in the sub-region have been
harmonized so that customs services within the community could
use uniform codes and descriptions following the adoption of a
common nomenclature.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 16 members, 14 countries in west Africa have
computerized their systems to facilitate customs formalities,
which will give a boost to inter-community trade.
</P>
<P>
The 4,460-km trans-Sahelian highway linking Dakar, Senegal and
Ndjamena, Chad is 85 percent completed, while the trans-coastal
road between Lagos and Nouakchott is 87 percent accomplished.
</P>
<P>
Plans are underway to establish a coastal shipping line and
institutional reform is in progress to liberalize the use of
airspace of member states.
</P>
<P>
The west African gas pipeline project, which will supply
Nigeria's gas to Benin, Togo and Ghana, is to be put into
construction soon, while a master plan has been evolved
concerning the provision of hydro-electric power and the
inter-connection of electricity grids across the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
All these, however, are far from what should have been
achieved.
</P>
<P>
As ECOWAS chairman, Nigeria's head of state General Sani
Abacha once put it, "Much has not been done and has to be done
particularly when the ultimate objectives, such as the creation
of a common customs union by the year 2000 and that of an
economic and monetary union by 2005, are concerned."
</P>
<P>
It is therefore a logic development that west African leaders
who met last August at the Abuja summit adopted a package of
measures to promote sub-regional economic integration.
</P>
<P>
The leaders agreed to implement sound macro-economic policies
to consolidate their respective success in inflation control,
monetary discipline and improved adjustment programs.
</P>
<P>
The strong political will the leaders expressed to further
cooperate for prosperity in the region is encouraging. But to
many observers, they have to redouble their efforts to turn the
good will into reality.
</P>
<P>
What disturbs observers is the failure to launch the
long-awaited ECOWAS travellers check scheduled for earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
When governors from the Central Banks of ECOWAS member states
gathered in Dakar, Senegal last week to finalize the launching,
the Francophone countries said they would not participate in the
scheme until some members settled their arrears of debts through
the sub-regional clearing mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Although efforts are underway to bring these countries back to
the negotiation table, the incident served as a touchstone for
sub-regional leaders to demonstrate their determination and
sincerity in putting their commitment into practice, an analyst
here said.
</P>
<P>
In the same vein, what west Africa needs urgently is to ensure
peace and security which are indispensable for development.
</P>
<P>
As Kouyate noted, nothing enduring can be built in a climate
of violence and instability.
</P>
<P>
Kouyate's view was echoed at the just-concluded 42nd session
of the ECOWAS council of ministers.
</P>
<P>
The ministers meeting in the Nigerian capital of Abuja earlier
this week urged strict observation of the ECOWAS and the United
Nations sanctions against the military junta in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Worried by the stranded peace process in that country, the
ministers called for an early resolution of the crisis there so
as to restore peace to the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that some individual countries with good
environment can achieve faster growth and become the power houses
for sub-regional development.
</P>
<P>
But their role will be limited when elements of instability
still pose a threat to peace in the entire sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, when west African leaders decide to shift the focus
of their efforts to economic development, they have to keep in
mind that peace keeping is often necessary and they should always
be ready to make contribution in this regard.

<HEADLINE> Destruction of Tainted Food Hurts Sri Lankan Traders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's large scale
campaign to destroy contaminated food so as to contain a cholera
epidemic has affected small and medium scale food industrialists.
</P>
<P>
About 400 businessmen have suffered losses due to destruction
of their food stocks, sources in the Sri Lankan Foundation for the
Development of Small and Medium Scale Industries said today. The
organization represents more than 4,500 businessmen nation-wide.
</P>
<P>
The sources said those affected have urged Health Minister
Nimal Siripala de Silva to stop "the indiscriminative destruction
of food items."
</P>
<P>
Public health inspectors have destroyed ice cream, yogurt and
cordials produced by the businessmen to help curb the
wide-spreading cholera epidemic in the nation.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, eight deaths caused by cholera have been reported
and 273 patients hospitalized in Sri Lanka since the disease began
to spread in September.
</P>
<P>
In some areas, traders were told by health inspectors to
refrain from purchasing and marketing food items produced by small
scale industrialists.
</P>
<P>
The move has caused certain losses to those food producers or
owners, who complained they were unable to pay salaries or repay
bank loans, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
They argued that it was unfair for the authorities to impose
food inspection regulations only against the small and medium
scale industry sector and destroy their food items
indiscriminately.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Foreign currency assets of
the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) dipped by 485 million U.S. dollars
for the week ending December 5 though there was no "active"
intervention by the central bank in the foreign exchange markets,
local press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The decline in foreign currency assets was less compared to the
previous week when it had dropped by 772 million dollars due to
active intervention by the RBI in the foreign exchange markets in
the country to check the sustained devaluation of the rupee.
</P>
<P>
During the week under review, the foreign exchange markets in
India were calmer as the RBI had announced a fresh set of measures
to suck rupee liquidity, raise dollar deposits of banks and
contain excessive speculation by dealers.
</P>
<P>
With the further fall in foreign currency assets, the foreign
exchange reserves of the RBI, which also include gold and special
drawing right reserves, fell by 627 million dollars to 27.487
billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Unscathed Singapore Prepared for Worse (1)  by Zeng Hu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 15 (Xinhua) -- As the eventful 1997 is
drawing to a close, the latest episode of the currency turmoil,
which has hit several major economies in Southeast Asia since
July, is still unabated and Singapore is getting prepared for
stormy weather ahead.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore economy has so far remained relatively unscathed
in the financial crisis that has played havoc with Asian
economies, which represented an important part of Asia's
miraculous economic growth.
</P>
<P>
However, observers here warn that if the crisis is allowed to
go on unsubdued, it would be a matter of time before Singapore too
is hit.
</P>
<P>
The mighty Singapore dollar, which had depreciated by about 12
percent against the U.S. dollar while other currencies in the
region had fallen by more than 20 to 40 percent as of last month,
was brought further down last Friday as Asian stock and currency
markets continued to be battered by the fallout from the financial
crisis in South Korea and the news that Indonesian President
Soeharto canceled his planned trip to Malaysia to attend an ASEAN
(Association of South East Asian Nations) informal summit because
of his health.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore dollar broke through the 1.65 level Friday,
hitting a 58-month low of 1.653 against the greenback and marking
a 15.6 percent decline from its July 1 level of 1.43 to the U.S.
dollar. Local media reports said that dealers were expecting the
Singapore currency to test the 1.70 level soon.
</P>
<P>
Despite its sound economic fundamentals and the fact that it
had been an exceptional example in the region that withstood the
storm in the foregoing months, it is obvious that Singapore, its
currency and its economic growth, are being dragged lower by the
mishaps in the other countries in the region and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
As demands for electronic products picked up in the U.S. and
European markets, Singapore had been doing quite well in the first
three quarters of the year, recovering from last year's slowdown.
</P>
<P>
Propelled by the resurgent electronics sector, the country's
gross domestic product (GDP) witnessed a remarkable 10.1 percent
growth in the third quarter this year.
</P>
<P>
This, again, testified to the economy's resilience and
officials from the Ministry for Trade and Industry expected the
momentum to continue into the current final quarter and cap the
full-year growth at around 7 percent, which was revised upwards
from the early projection of 6 to 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition to its well-regulated management of the financial
sector, one more reason why Singapore succeeded in shielding
itself from the worst effects of the regional crisis is the
diversity of its economy.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Unscathed Singapore Prepared for Worse (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Observers note that each major sector, be it financial services
or communications, has become an important engine in its own
right. Furthermore, while intra-Asia trade and investments have
increased, Singapore's final markets mainly remain the developed
countries in North America and Europe, which at present lie well
beyond the striking distance of the crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the Ministry for Trade and Industry recognized that a
large part of Singapore's regional trade consists of intra-firm
movement of parts and components by multinational companies.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts here say that all this should not be taken to
mean that Singapore could jump out of the crisis all by itself and
soon.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, they point out once again that although
Singapore has been doing much better in many ways than its
hard-hit neighbors, it will have to be and is being affected by
the developments in countries around it and its economic growth
will pick up steam only after the neighbors are on their feet
again.
</P>
<P>
They say that now in Singapore, the manufacturing upswing has
masked a significant downturn in the services sector. Tourism is
expecting to see "near zero" growth in visitor arrivals this year,
and the retail sector is getting the bite.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, with mortgage rates on the rise, the property
sector will have to grapple with a continuing slide in home prices
and with its consequent negative "wealth effect," while
developers, banks and other property-related businesses are in for
a long haul.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan said late last month
that Singapore could not escape being hit by the regional turmoil
over the next two years. The big question, he said, is whether the
region suffers a short, sharp downturn, or a prolonged period of
slow or no growth.
</P>
<P>
The key, he stressed, is whether the regional governments are
prepared to take the bitter medicine necessary to nurse their
economies back to good health.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the right prescription is followed, the
short-term pain will be considerable but a robust recovery will
follow. Otherwise, the alternative is a long malaise, which will
eventually cause more hardship in the region.

"Whether there is a sharp slowdown or worse a prolonged period
of low or no growth, Singapore will not be totally unaffected.
Because our economic situation is fundamentally sound, we may not
suffer as much as the regional countries. However, as the
Singapore economy is closely linked through trade and investment
with the region, we must be prepared that the regional slowdown
will impact, hopefully not severely, our economic growth in 1998
and perhaps also in 1999," the deputy prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
When releasing the country's third quarter economic survey last
month, the Ministry for Trade and Industry said some moderation of
growth can be expected as regional growth slows down. The
ministry's preliminary 1998 GDP forecast is 5 to 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, three weeks later, Minister for Trade and Industry Lee
Yock Suan said that the government would review its economic
growth forecast for next year of between 5 and 7 percent because
of the financial crisis that had hit the South Korean economy.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing currency and economic turmoil in the region was
bound to have some impact on Singapore, although it was still
difficult to say how big the impact would be, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The signs are that this year the economy is still doing well,
but next year we have to watch and see," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here note that as the crisis rages on with no sign of
coming to an end soon, several international investment houses
have cut down their 1998 forecast of Singapore's growth to around
4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The recent developments have given rise to calls for Singapore
to get prepared for "a long spell of heavy weather." When asked if
the government would be embarking on any new policies as a result
of the recent crisis, Lee Yock Suan said the government Committee
on Singapore's Competitiveness, which he chairs, was still doing
its work and promised that the committee would have to "take stock
of the new situation".

LHASA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- While products from many parts
of China continue to pour into Tibet, the autonomous region is
also expanding the spread of its products to other parts of China.
</P>
<P>
A group of local products with ethnic characteristics like
"Hongjingtian Tonic Tea", "Lhasa Carpets", and "Lhasa Beer" are
moving into the markets in many parts of China.
</P>
<P>
Although many are still in the initial stage of making a name
in the central and eastern Chinese markets, sales are
increasing. "Nearly 70 percent of our products are sold in central
and eastern markets," says the director of the Lhasa Food Plant,
whose major product is tonic tea and which has sales centers in
Beijing, Xi'an, Shenzhen, Xiamen and Luoyang. The company also
plans to launch a nationwide advertising campaign before the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
Some Tibetan factories took part in a recent exhibition in
Shanghai and Tibetan businessmen are confident about entering the
central and eastern markets although the Tibetan economy is
backward.
</P>
<P>
"Many of the plateau products here are rare and they are very
competitive," says one Tibetan businessman.

<HEADLINE> Fiat Leadership Unaltered by Death of Agnelli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The death of Giovanni Alberto
Agnelli, the acknowledged heir to the Fiat auto empire, will not
change the accepted scenario for the group's leadership in the
near future, Fiat Honorary Chairman Gianni Agnelli said today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Fiat-owned daily La Stampa, he said
his nephew Alberto Agnelli was never in line to take over at the
company helm when current Chairman Cesare Romiti retires in 1998
or 1999.
</P>
<P>
"Some time would have had to pass before he could have taken on
his full responsibilities," the honorary chairman said after
Alberto Agnelli, head of the Piaggio scooter-maker, died of cancer
at the age of 33 at home in Turin last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
His death changed the long term scenario, but had no immediate
effect on Italy's largest industrial group, said Agnelli, grandson
of Fiat's founder Giovanni Agnelli.
</P>
<P>
"It's a terrible drama for the family," said a Fiat spokesman.
"But it's a private one. It's not a drama for the company, which
is a multinational led by a group of top-rank managers."
</P>
<P>
Romiti's successor is unlikely to be another Agnelli family
member, because there is no candidate with the training or
inclination to take the helm.
</P>
<P>
It was said that top Fiat consultant Paolo Fresco and Managing
Director Paolo Cantarella may have the possibility to replace
Romiti.
</P>
<P>
Agnelli said this summer that he had a candidate in mind to
replace Romiti, but declined to say who it was.
</P>
<P>
Alberto Agnelli's death will put off indefinitely the moment
when an Agnelli returns to take the reins of Fiat, whose managing
leadership had only two outsiders since the auto company was
established.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Rice Cereals See Export Potential: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's cereal products
made from rice flour have high potentials for export sale,
according to a study of the Thai Farmers Research Center available
today.
</P>
<P>
These products include rice crackers, instant noodles and
glutinous flour.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's exports of rice cereals expanded steadily in the
last ten years, rising from 84,000 tons in 1986 to 143,000 tons in
1996, with the total value increased from 930 million baht (37
million U.S. dollars) to 3.3 billion baht (78.5 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months this year, exports of the products
totaled 93,500 tons, earning 2.49 billion baht (59 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Asians living in the United States are the main buyers of Thai
instant noodles, while Japan is the largest importer of Thai rice
crackers, the study said.
</P>
<P>
The weakening baht has given an extra edge to exports of these
products, the study said.

NEW DELHI, December 15 (Xinhua) -- India's annual rate of

<HEADLINE> Business Confidence Down in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Japanese business confidence
worsened for both manufacturers and nonmanufacturers, reflecting the
country's prolonged economic slump, according to a key quarterly
survey report released by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) Monday.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said in its Tankan report that the key diffusion
index measuring the sentiment of executives of major manufacturers
fell to minus 11 in the December survey from a positive 3 in the
September report.
</P>
<P>
The central bank had predicted in the September survey that the
index would drop in December, but remain in positive territory at 1.
</P>
<P>
The BOJ said in the latest survey that the index for major
nonmanufacturers fell to minus 20.
</P>
<P>
It said the index for small and medium-sized manufacturers fell to
minus 21 from minus 13 in September, and to minus 25 for their
nonmanufacturing counterparts from minus 18.
</P>
<P>
The indexes, which are watched closely to gauge Japan's business
climate, are derived by subtracting the percentage of companies that
think business conditions are unfavorable from the percentage that say
prospects are looking up.
</P>
<P>
Nonmanufacturers include the service, construction, real estate,
trading and telecommunications sectors.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, the survey showed the confidence index for major
manufacturers is expected to fall further to minus 15 and that for
nomanufacturers to minus 22 by the time next report is released in
March.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Trade Edge Lost in Asian Currency Crisis: </HEADLINE>

<P>
BANGKOK, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Thai Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanhaeminda has admitted that the country is losing its
prospective trading edge as Asian currencies continue to plunge
against the US dollar.
</P>
<P>
As the Korean won, Indonesian rupiah, Malaysian ringgit and
Japanese yen continue to drop against the dollar, Thailand's hopes
to gain a competitive edge in exports through the baht's slide
have been dashed, the Bangkok Post today quoted Tarrin as saying
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The regional economic crisis means that Thailand's markets in
Asia have seen a decline in buying power, reducing demand for Thai
products.
</P>
<P>
He said the region is now experiencing capital flight as global
investors head for safer havens in their home markets.
</P>
<P>
He said, "we have to help ourselves... we have to take action,
decisively and expeditiously."
</P>
<P>
He said the most critical task for the government now was to
deal with the problems of the financial sector, to enable the
system to serve as a foundation and efficient intermediary for the
rest of the economy.

largest port and manufacturing center has an edge in exports, but
that increasing labor and raw material costs, combined with a
cargo shortage, have resulted in a drop in some industrial exports.
</P>
<P>
So, Shanghai plans to use this as an opportunity for industrial
restructuring to place greater emphasis on the service sector,
in design, investment, circulation of goods, warehousing and
advertising.
</P>
<P>
The city has drawn up a three-year plan, whereby service trade
earnings, which accounted for 42 percent of Shanghai's GDP last
year, will reach eight billion U.S. dollars by the year 2000,
equivalent to 21 percent of the city's cargo trade.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai will also adopt some international practices and form
large enterprise groups to lift the ratio of the service sector to
the GDP to 60 percent of the city's total by 2010.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Mario Stecher of Austria
easily won the 15-kilometer cross country leg Sunday to claim his
first victory in four events of Nordic combined World Cup this
season.
</P>
<P>
The victory enabled Stecher to reclaim the FIS World Cup's
leader's bib from Hannu Manninen of Finland.
</P>
<P>
Manninen suffered visibly during the longer second race and
dropped back to 24th place, four minutes, 34.5 seconds behind the
winner.
</P>
<P>
After launching a pair of spectacular jumps on the K112 big
hill Saturday, Stecher carried a 50-second advantage over teammate
David Kreiner entering Sunday's race. Stecher's winning time of
37:52.5 combined with his jump points of 248.6 for a decisive
victory.
</P>
<P>
Second place went to Norway's Bjarte Engen Vik, who had a
cross country time of 37:06.2, but couldn't make up a 1:26 start
handicap and finished 39.7 seconds off the pace. Third went to
American Todd Lodwick, who finished 46.8 seconds back on his
hometown hill.
</P>
<P>
Reigning World Cup champion Kenji Ogiwara of Japan placed
eighth in Sunday's combined results, 2:28 behind the winner.
</P>
<P>
Stecher has a 10-point lead over Vik in the overall standings,
485 to 475. Manninen is third with 397.

<HEADLINE> Northeast Provinces Enhances Farmland Productivity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Three provinces in northeast
China, the country's major commercial grain-producing center, have
been pursuing high grain yields to increase output.
</P>
<P>
During the last three years Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang
provinces improved 2.45 million hectares of mid- and low-yield
land and reclaimed 407,000 hectares of wasteland, which added 14
million tons to their total grain output.
</P>
<P>
The three provinces have a large potential for increasing the
per-unit grain yield. Official figures show that the region has 16
million hectares of arable land, 9 million hectares of which
proved to have a yield of less than 2.25 tons each. The region
also has vast tracts of wasteland, which has been estimated at 2
million hectares.
</P>
<P>
Heilongjiang Province for example, has 80 percent of its
farmland in low-productive farming. During the last 10 years, work
has been finished on 520 million cubic meters of earth reclamation
and 1.4 million hectares of farmland has been transformed. The
effort has added 9.975 million tons of grain, or 45.9 percent of
total grain output in the corresponding period.
</P>
<P>
Also taken into account is investment in improving and
upgrading farmland. In recent trade talks held in Harbin, capital
city of the province, 200 land-promotion projects were open for
investment.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, local sources reported that contracts signed with
Shenzhen and Hong Kong investors are expected to bring 300 million
yuan (36 million US dollars) for transforming 41,300 hectares of
wasteland.

<HEADLINE> Survey Finds Emergency Requests for Food, Shelter up in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Despite a surging economy
and low unemployment, demand for emergency food and shelter
continued to grow this year, according to a survey by U.S.
Conference of Mayors.
</P>
<P>
The survey of 29 cities, to be made public Monday, contains
good and bad news on how the nation's poor are coping.
</P>
<P>
The good news is that requests for emergency housing are up
just 3 percent -- the smallest increase in the survey's 13-year
history.
</P>
<P>
On the down side, requests for emergency food rose an average
of 16 percent, the largest increase since 1992, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
Among the reasons, officials said, are low wages and high
housing costs. Nearly all the cities expected demand for food and
shelter to rise next year.
</P>
<P>
The survey, based on self-reporting by the cities, found:
</P>
<P>
-- Emergency food assistance requests increased in 24 of the 29
cities surveyed.
</P>
<P>
-- About one-fifth of emergency food help demands is estimated
to have gone unfulfilled. Only two cities reported that no food
assistance request went unanswered.
</P>
<P>
-- And, seventeen of the cities saw shelter requests rise,
while the number of emergency shelter beds among all the cities
decreased an average of 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Officials of one city said the housing situation improved.
More common, however, are tales of reduced bed spaces and tougher
eligibility requirements.
</P>
<P>
Of the homeless population, about 47 percent are single men, 36
percent families with children, 14 percent single women and 4
percent minors, the survey found.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Leftist Rebels Declare Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine leftist rebel
group, the New People's Army (NPA), has declared a 16-day
ceasefire starting on December 22 in keeping with the spirit of
the Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of the Philippines and its armed wing, the
NPA, said in a communique that the ceasefire was issued on
humanitarian grounds and as an act of goodwill.
</P>
<P>
The ceasefire was issued apparently in response to an earlier
declaration of a 30-day ceasefire during the Christmas season
against the rebels by President Fidel Ramos, local press reports
said today.
</P>
<P>
The unilateral ceasefire declared by Ramos took effect from
December 6, 1997 to January 4, 1998. But Ramos earlier said it
would not cover normal law enforcement activities by the military.
</P>
<P>
The government's ceasefire provided a conducive climate for the
resumption of peace negotiations between the government and the
NPA's political wing National Democratic Front (NDF) in the
Netherlands, where rebel leaders live.
</P>
<P>
A series of rebel attacks, including the abductions of a police
chief and an army sergeant in October in the southern Philippines,
prompted the government to suspend talks that have been proceeding
sporadically since 1992 in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
After the NPA freed the captives on December 5, the government
announced it would resume the talks in January 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party has fought the government for more than
three decades and still has a presence in many hinterland areas,
including some rural villages around metropolitan Manila.
</P>
<P>
Military statistics estimated that from a high of 25,600 NPA
fighters in 1986, the number of the NPA guerrillas has gone down
to 5,000 as of November 30 this year.

<HEADLINE> Preferential Policies Help Job Search In Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The provincial labor
department in central-south China's Hunan Province recently worked
out preferential policies to help accelerate the re-employment of
laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises that hire unemployed workers and sign contracts of
more than a year with them are entitled to receive unemployment
compensation that would have been given to the workers by
insurance companies, in one lump sum.
</P>
<P>
With labor and tax department approval, small and medium-sized
enterprises that hire a certain number of unemployed workers can
have their taxes reduced.
</P>
<P>
Laid-off workers are also being encouraged to make a living on
their own, and those who do so voluntarily can get
compensation. Self-employed workers can also continue their
old-age pension, provided they continue to pay insurance premiums.
</P>
<P>
According to reliable sources, the province has developed a
series of preferential policies since 1994, which have helped
re-employ approximately 80,000 workers, accounting for 51 percent
of the province's unemployed people.

<P>
GUIYANG, December 15 (Xinhua) -- A share-holding company will
be formed and listed on a stock exchange to raise funds for
the development of the Huangguoshu Waterfall and other major
tourist attractions in Guizhou Province.
</P>
<P>
The Huangguoshu Travel Industry Co. Ltd., which is being
formed, will focus on the development of a 130-kilometer tourist
route linking Guiyang, the provincial capital, with Huangguoshu
Waterfall, China's largest, where four national scenic areas are
located.
</P>
<P>
With a unique landscape and colorful folklore, the route --
with the waterfall as the center -- is considered one of 12 newly
emerging tourist destinations in the country. However, since
Guizhou in southwest China is an underdeveloped mountainous
region, a lack of funds has hindered the route's development.
</P>
<P>
The new company plans to raise both domestic and overseas funds
for the construction and improvement of scenic spots for folklore
villages, river-rafting, hot-air ballooning and cliff
climbing. Improvements also are planned in transportation, hotels,
shopping, entertainment and sightseeing.

<HEADLINE> Insurance Sector in Guangzhou Gaining Ground </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The insurance business in the
capital of Guangdong Province is making headway in spite of
increasing market competition.
</P>
<P>
The premium of Guangzhou already accounts for one-fourth
of the province's total with substantial progress also achieved in
standardizing the insurance market.
</P>
<P>
The city's insurance companies turned out a total revenue of
2.644 billion yuan during the January-September period, up 36.86
percent over the same period last year. The premium, on the other
hand, climbed more than 41 percent to 2.541 billion yuan during
that period.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of the insurance business is a result of the
increasing strength of the provincial economy, said Ma Jing, the
city's central bank governor.
</P>
<P>
With 18 percent of the nation's insurance income of 66 billion
yuan going to Guangdong Province last year, Guangzhou held more
than one-fourth of the province's total.
</P>
<P>
The city also became the second city after Shanghai to
experiment with opening up the insurance sector to overseas
businesses. So far, 18 overseas insurance companies have launched
representative offices in the city.
</P>
<P>
The city also made strides in standardizing and regulating the
youth market. A professional association was set up for more
self-discipline among the companies, and the city's central bank
also was tightened up supervision, to encourage fair competition
in the business.

<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, December 15 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province, one
of the country's leading grain producers, now leads in the use of
farm machinery as well.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that machinery account for 59 percent of
Anhui's agricultural production. The province ranks first in the
country in the use of small tractors per unit of farmland also.
</P>
<P>
The Provincial Agricultural Machinery Bureau officials
attribute the high rate of machinery utilization to increasing
enthusiasm shown by local farmers, who have spent 4.2 billion yuan
for this purpose since last year.
</P>
<P>
The province can expect this year's agricultural machinery
business to be worth eight billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Machinery maintenance has had parallel development. The
province now has 50 county-level maintenance centers, 1,600
township service stations, and 16,000 machinery service teams in
villages. In addition, machine products are easily obtainable at
14,000 sales outlets throughout the province.

<HEADLINE> Free Services Prevail in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 15 (Xinhua) -- In Shanghai's luxury shopping
malls, cosmetologists improve women's looks, sales girls
color customers' hair -- all free of charge.
</P>
<P>
The city's residents are getting used to the free services
provided by various businesses as a means of promotion.
</P>
<P>
"I often receive gift packs of shampoo and washing powder,"
said Zhang Lihong, who lives in a residential compound in the
Yangpu District, claiming that she has not bought shampoo for a
long time.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Telephone Directory Company gave its yellow pages
free to businesses in 1994. This year's yellow pages have entered
into almost all urban family homes.
</P>
<P>
Ticket-free shows are not unusual. The large-scale square
concerts near the Bund especially get nationwide fame.
</P>
<P>
However, free service is not always welcome. Some customers are
uncomfortable with the touting for business.
</P>
<P>
"The free service is just for sales promotion," said Xu Bo. "I
would feel like owing them if I enjoyed the service but never
bought their products," said Bo, from neighboring Hangzhou City
who went shopping recently in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Hygiene is another problem. Some sales people even try a single
lipstick on 20 to 30 customers.
</P>
<P>
Most urbanites said that they favored the free service for
customers'' convenience, but not merely for profit.

<HEADLINE> Pollution Menaces Health of Future Generations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists are
cautioning that environmental pollution could pose serious threats
to future generations because of its harmful effects on genes.
</P>
<P>
Lin Xiuwu, a professor at Changchun-based Dr. Norman Bethune
Medical University (NBMU) and a 73-year-old specialist in the
field of heavy metal pollution, said that parents exposed to a
modicum of heavy metals for a long time increase the possibility
that their infants will suffer malformation or physical defect.
</P>
<P>
Lin's research shows that heavy metals could damage cell
membranes. It can trigger a series of disturbances inside the
cell, including alterations of micro structure of the cell and of
its enzyme. Finally, the damage affects DNA.
</P>
<P>
Scientists further found that heavy metals also produces huge
effects on the genital system of males. They can cause a reduction
in quantity of sperm as well as deforming sperm through their
effects on the changes of genetic substances.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, researchers added, fetuses are so fragile that they
are easily affected by heavy metals inside their mothers.
</P>
<P>
Sun Zhiwei, a 32-year-old professor of the NBMU, said that the
environment on Earth is increasingly deteriorated. More and more
chemical wastes -- especially heavy metals such as mercury,
amalgam, lead inside gasoline -- are being dumped into the human
world, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sun suggested that people take more food containing selenium or
sulphides to reduce the heavy metals' damage to the human body,
noting that garlic can help humans resist pollution.

Playing with a five-man defence, including the 37-year-old

<HEADLINE> China's Shipping Industry Booming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 15 (Xinhua) -- China's shipping industry has
flourished since 1978, when the country launched its ongoing
reform and opening drive. The country's shipping sector now boasts
one of the largest fleets in the world.
</P>
<P>
These remarks by Vice-Minister of Communications Liu Songjin in
Shanghai were made recently at an international seminar on marine
technology.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the Chinese government has attached
great importance to the development of the shipping industry and
has made it an important part of the country's transport
system. Great efforts have been made to build ports and water
ways, he added.
</P>
<P>
Major reform measures have been taken to reinvigorate the
shipping industry, including re-organizing many shipping companies
into three large groups -- China Ocean Shipping Group, China
Marine Shipping Group and the Yangtze River Shipping Group.
</P>
<P>
The three groups have 87.6 billion yuan in total assets and 28
million tons in handling capacity. Their capacity accounts for
56 percent of the country's entire shipping industry.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, China had 406 deep-water berths in its
coastal ports, and 110,000 kilometers of inland water channels and
514 berths.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this century, a number of trunk water channels
will be built along the Yangtze River, the Xijiang River, the
Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, as well as the Yangtze River Delta
and the Zhujiang River Delta.
</P>
<P>
Currently, China has 360,000 civil vessels, with more than 310
international shipping companies, more than 1,300 coastal shipping
firms and more than 5,100 river shipping enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the country's total shipping volume reached 1.27
billion tons and 1,755 billion tons/kilometers. Meanwhile, Chinese
ports had started 120 regular international shipping routes,
operating 2,102 voyages every month.

<HEADLINE> America's Child Labor Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Underage children still
toil in fields and factories scattered across America, an
investigation found.
</P>
<P>
The poorest and most vulnerable among them start working before
other children start kindergarten. Many earn wages below the legal
minimum, often in exhausting, or even hazardous, jobs.
</P>
<P>
In the past five months, The Associated Press found 165
children working illegally in 16 states, from the chili fields of
New Mexico to the sweatshops of New York City.
</P>
<P>
The AP was able to follow the work products of 50 children to
more than two dozen companies including Campbell Soup Co.,
Newman's Own, Costco, H.J. Heinz and Sears.
</P>
<P>
All the companies that responded condemned illegal child labor.
Many launched investigations when told of suppliers employing
underage children.
</P>
<P>
To make an estimate, the AP had Rutgers University economist
Douglas L. Kruse analyze monthly census surveys and other
government data.
</P>
<P>
His study estimates that 290,200 children were employed
unlawfully last year. Some were older teens working quite a few
hours in after-school jobs. But also among them were 59,600
children under age 14 and 13,100 who worked in garment sweatshops,
defined as factories with repeated labor violations.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Repeats Conditions for Dialogue with Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States,
responding to Iranian President Mohammad Khatami's hope for
dialogue with the American people, said on Sunday that it was
interested in what the Iranian government does, but not what it
says: a repetition of the Washington policy towards Iran.
</P>
<P>
"The United States is interested in deeds, not words," White
House spokesman Barry Toiv said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference on Sunday, President Khatami
said: "I take this opportunity to pay my respects to the great
American people, and hope to have a dialogue with the American
people in the not too distant future."
</P>
<P>
He said he was in an effort to build "peace and security and
tranquillity" through the possible dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Khatami was elected the president with a landslide victory in
May elections, and U.S. President Bill Clinton said afterwards
that he viewed the election of Khatami "as an interesting
development" of Iran's politics.
</P>
<P>
During a summit of the Organization of Islamic Conference in
Tehran last week, Khatami indicated his willingness for a
dialogue with the West. And he now made a direct call for that
dialogue with the American people.
</P>
<P>
But Toiv reaffirmed U.S. policy toward Iran, saying this kind
of dialogue should be taken after Iraq stops "the development of
weapons of mass destruction... the supporting of terrorism...and
the impediment of the Middle East peace process," the three
allegations strongly denied by the Iranian government.
</P>
<P>
Toiv declined to say whether the United States would seek any
contacts with the Iranian government.
</P>
<P>
The United States has severed diplomatic relations with Iran
since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said the Clinton administration should rethink
its policy of isolating Iran as newly-elected Iranian President
Khatami has made some conciliatory posture with good will.

<HEADLINE> White House Official Says Clinton Will Make Lee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
will sidestep the Senate and make Bill Lann Lee his top civil
rights enforcer, although how to do it remains a question, said a
White House senior adviser on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's senior adviser, Rahm Emanuel, said the president
still wants the Republican-controlled Senate to vote on Lee's
nomination as assistant attorney general for civil rights.
</P>
<P>
But Senate Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch said Sunday, "That's
not going to happen."
</P>
<P>
With no vote forthcoming, Emanuel said Clinton would name Lee
either in an acting capacity or through an appointment while the
Senate is in recess, so Clinton can proceed with enforcing
anti-discrimination laws.
</P>
<P>
"The president is going to decide which road he will take, but
both roads lead to one goal line," Emanuel said on CNN's "Late
Edition".
</P>
<P>
A recess appointment would let Lee hold the job for only a
year. Installing him in an acting capacity would allow him to stay
until Clinton's term ends, but without the authority Senate
confirmation brings.
</P>
<P>
Lee, 48 is a veteran Chinese American lawyer for National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People.

<HEADLINE> PM: Turkey to Halt Political Dialogue with EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz announced here today that the Turkish government will
halt its political dialogue with the European Union (EU) from
now on.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz made the remark at a press conference following a
cabinet meeting called today to study Turkey's policy toward the
EU, local TV reports said.
</P>
<P>
"The EU will never be addressed in any political negotiations,
but our bilateral relations with the EU states will continue,"
Yilmaz said.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that Turkey will not participate in the
European conference scheduled for March in Britain although the
EU leaders attending the just-concluded Luxembourg summit had sent
an invitation to Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The EU summit meeting, which ended Saturday afternoon,
decided to exclude Turkey from the present EU enlargement process
on grounds that Turkey did not meet the standards of the
European bloc.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz, however, said that the EU summit did not evaluate
Turkey's application issue in the same framework as other
candidate countries.
</P>
<P>
Biased, prejudiced and exaggerated assessments have been made
regarding Turkey's domestic issues and foreign policy, he added.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been sparing no effort for full EU membership but
so far no substantial progress has been made due to its
differences with the European body.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders held that Turkey has a long way to go in
improving its human rights record, resolving its disputes with
neighboring Greece as well as settling the Kurdish issue.
</P>
<P>
On EU's criticism of Turkey's policy towards Cyprus, Yilmaz
said that Turkey will not change its consistent position on the
Cyprus issue despite international pressure.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Ankara will speed up its integration
cooperation with the Turkish Cypriots on the Cyprus island if the
EU starts accessions negotiations with the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Foreign Ministry also issued a written statement
late today to protest the EU decision regarding Turkey's
membership bid, describing it as "unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
British Ambassador to Ankara David Logan reportedly delivered a
message from British Prime Minister Tony Blair to Yilmaz, whose
content was not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that Blair is apparently trying to
persuade Turkey to participate in the European Conference to
be held in Britain.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriots: EU's Decision to Kill Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 14 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish Cypriots today
warned that the decision of the European Union (EU) to start
accession talks with Cyprus will kill the peace process, the
Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Turkish Cypriots said EU's decision
will destroy the international efforts for the reunification of
the divided island.
</P>
<P>
Despite firm opposition of Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots, the
EU summit Saturday decided to start accession talks with Cyprus
next March.
</P>
<P>
The EU has only helped destroy the established framework for a
settlement of the Cyprus problem, which has emerged through the
process of intercommunal negotiations, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the Turkish Cypriots will take whatever steps
necessary in all fields, according to the agency.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus was divided into a southern Greek Cypriot community and
a northern Turkish Cypriot community in 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the Mediterranean
island after an abortive pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The international community has been making efforts to seek a
solution to the protracted problem, but no tangible results have
been achieved.
