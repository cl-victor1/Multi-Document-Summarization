<HEADLINE> Holtz Still Looking for First Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- Lou Holtz knew he faced a rebuilding job at  
South Carolina. That doesn't make the losing any easier to take. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gamecocks remained 0-for-Lou with a 24-9 loss to No. 11  
Georgia, the extent of their offensive futility readily apparent 
with five sacks and 15 minus-yardage plays. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can play better than this,'' said Holtz, whose team was  
shut out in its opener and went nearly three quarters without 
scoring Saturday night. ``We have to play better than this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Courtney Leavitt finally erased South Carolina's string of zeros  
with a 28-yard field goal with 2:58 left in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gamecocks (0-2, 0-1 Southeastern Conference) scored their  
first touchdown of the season in garbage time, Phil Petty throwing 
an 8-yard pass to Carlos Spikes with just over 3 minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody wants to lose,'' said Holtz, who has 216 victories in  
his college career. ``We came down here to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Gamecocks lost their last 10 games under former coach Brad  
Scott, then set off a wave of hysteria by hiring Holtz to revive 
the program. His impact is apparent everywhere among the South 
Carolina faithful, right down to the ``Lou'' signs waved by the 
cheerleaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, all Holtz can do is coach. The Gamecocks need some  
guys who can pass, catch and block. 
</P>
<P>
	``Georgia is a good football team,'' said Petty, thoroughly  
battered in a 12-for-28, two-interception performance. ``They're 
big, strong and powerful. We've got to get better as a team. We 
don't have a lot of depth right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A series in the third quarter demonstrated South Carolina's  
offensive ineptitude. After picking up a first down on Perry's 
21-yard pass to Hood, the Gamecocks lost 22 yards on their next 
three plays. 
</P>
<P>
	Freshman Derek Watson was caught nine yards deep in the  
backfield by Tony Gilbert on an attempted option play, then Petty 
was sacked twice in a row, losing seven yards on a hit by Orantes 
Grant and six more when he was tripped up by Richard Seymour. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson, who rushed for 118 yards in his first game, managed only  
29 yards in his second. That was still enough to lead the team on a 
night when South Carolina had just 46 yards on 30 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	For Georgia (2-0, 1-0), Quincy Carter threw a 47-yard touchdown  
pass to Terrence Edwards, Jasper Sanks rushed for a career-high 130 
yards and Kendrell Bell led a swarming defense with an interception 
and blocked punt. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia built a 14-0 lead at halftime but struggled to put the  
Gamecocks away. The Bulldogs had 431 yards, but were plagued by a 
fumble in South Carolina territory and at least a dozen dropped 
passes. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the worst game I've ever coached as far as dropped  
passes,'' said Georgia coach Jim Donnan. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the drops, Carter went 21-of-38 for 251 yards. He also  
ran seven times for 33 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``We take him for granted around here,'' Donnan said. ``He's a  
human highlight film.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulldogs, who played without sophomore linebacker Will  
Witherspoon (sprained ankle) and junior flanker Michael Greer 
(migraine headaches), suffered another loss early in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Running back Robert Arnaud sprained his left knee after trying  
to dive over the top on first-and-goal from the 1. Arnaud was 
stuffed at the line by John Abraham, then apparently twisted his 
knee in the pileup that followed. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnaud will be out for at least three weeks, according to  
Donnan, who was upset about the way the injury occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	``They grabbed him in the pile and took his knee out,'' Donnan  
said. ``I don't know if it was on purpose or not. Maybe they 
thought he was still running. But it's tough when an injury happens 
like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulldogs had lost freshman running back DeJuan Green  
(fractured jaw) in the opener, so Donnan plans to give freshmen 
Charles Grant and Kenny Bailey more work in the backfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia is off this weekend, while South Carolina meets East  
Carolina in Holtz's first home game.

<HEADLINE> Florida State Holds No. 1 Ranking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Penn State's close call against unranked Pittsburgh cost the  
Nittany Lions the No. 2 ranking, while Florida State remained No. 1 
with a close call against Georgia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles (2-0) held the No. 1 spot in The Associated Press'  
Top 25 college football poll with a 41-35 win over the Yellow 
Jackets. But idle Tennessee (1-0), the defending national 
champions, returned to No. 2 as the Nittany Lions fell after a 
20-17 win over the Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking a bigger tumble was Notre Dame (1-2), which fell eight  
spots to No. 24 following a 28-23 loss at Purdue (2-0). The 
Boilermakers moved up six places to No. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Rounding out the Top 10, Florida and Nebraska were tied for No.  
4, followed by No. 6 Michigan, No. 7 Texas A&AMP;M. No. 8 Miami, No. 9 
Wisconsin and No. 10 Virginia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sunday's balloting by the 70 sports writers and broadcaster  
on the AP panel, Florida State received 49 first-place votes and 
1,725 points -- 18 more first-place votes than last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vols were second with 13 first-place votes and 1,650 points;  
the Nittany Lions (3-0) had six first-place votes and 1,619 points. 
Last week, Penn State had 26 first-place votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida (2-0), a 58-27 winner over Central Florida, had one  
first-place vote, as did Virginia Tech (2-0), which beat 
Alabama-Birmingham 31-10. Florida and Nebraska, a 45-0 winner over 
California, both totaled 1,446 points. 
</P>
<P>
	There should be another shakeup after next week's games, which  
feature Penn State at Miami, Tennessee at Florida and North 
Carolina State, No. 20 this week, at Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia was No. 11, followed by Georgia Tech, Ohio State,  
Purdue, Arkansas, Kansas State, Southern California, Alabama, 
Arizona, NC State, UCLA, Arizona State, Colorado State, Notre Dame 
and BYU. 
</P>
<P>
	In the USA Today/ESPN coaches' poll, the top five are: Florida  
State, Tennessee, Penn State, Florida and Michigan.

<HEADLINE> Returning Puerto Ricans Bewildered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Elizam Escobar searched deeply into  
his past as he greeted friends and relatives whose faces had aged 
and voices had changed during the nearly two decades he'd been away 
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you remember me?'' asked a man who hugged Escobar in his  
first hours of freedom Saturday in his homeland of Puerto Rico. 
There was a glint of recognition, then an avalanche of memories, as 
Escobar, a graphic artist from New York, gave his friend a bear hug 
at his mother's house. 
</P>
<P>
	Joy and bewilderment filled Escobar and six other Puerto Rican  
nationalists who came home to this Caribbean island over the 
weekend. They were among 14 who had accepted a controversial 
clemency offer from President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	All had been imprisoned on sedition and weapons convictions  
stemming from their involvement in the Armed Forces of National 
Liberation, a pro-independence group blamed for 130 bombings in the 
United States that killed six people and wounded dozens of others 
from 1974 to 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first public expression of remorse from one of the freed  
prisoners, Ricardo Jimenez, who arrived in San Juan Sunday night, 
said on NBC's Meet the Press that he regretted the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	``In anything that has happened, the precaution that we've  
always taken is the preservation of human life -- you know, we're 
deeply sorry that other things have happened contrary to that,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the other prisoners, Jimenez was welcomed at the airport  
Sunday night by a crowd of jubilant independence supporters. 
``Freedom! Freedom!'' they shouted as Jimenez raised a Puerto Rican 
flag in salute. 
</P>
<P>
	As they returned home to a flurry of hugs and home-cooked meals,  
the former prisoners were able to forget, for the moment, the 
political firestorm surrounding their case. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the criticism continued unabated on the mainland.  
</P>
<P>
	Republican presidential contender Steve Forbes said Saturday  
that the releases amounted to a ``terrorists-for-votes deal'' to 
help Clinton's wife, Hillary, in her possible campaign to win a 
U.S. Senate seat from New York. He challenged Vice President Al 
Gore, also a presidential contender, to say where he stands on the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	In the middle-class suburb of Bayamon, Escobar tugged at the  
cheek of 1 1/2-year-old Anel Rios, brought to him by his cousin Elizam 
Rios. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's never seen him. I've never seen him,'' said Rios, who  
was five when Escobar was imprisoned. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives and friends crowded into the sweltering house, where a  
1991 poster honoring Escobar and his paintings hung on a wall. 
Curious neighbors watched the gentle celebration from their porch 
across the street. 
</P>
<P>
	``So much time. So much time. But here we are,'' a beaming  
friend said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the kitchen, relatives prepared the national dish of rice and  
beans, mashed plantains, oven-baked bread, fish and salad. 
</P>
<P>
	The festivities lasted into Sunday, the anniversary of two  
important nationalist events. It was the birthday of Pedro Albizu 
Campos, the founder of Puerto Rico's independence movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday was also the anniversary of the 1983 robbery of a Wells  
Fargo truck in which militants of Puerto Rico's Macheteros guerilla 
group stole $7.1 million that officials said was to fund terrorist 
attacks against the United States. Three of those convicted in that 
robbery were forgiven outstanding fines under Clinton's clemency. 
</P>
<P>
	A reflective Escobar -- thinner than in a portrait displayed on a  
table -- took it all in stride, watching a television report on the 
freed prisoners' return to Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	Escobar said that he and the other prisoners were going to  
continue struggling for independence. Escobar also wants to expel 
the U.S. Navy from the outlying island of Vieques, where the Navy 
maintains a live-fire bombing range within miles of some 10,000 
inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
	Another freed activist, Adolfo Matos, showed little remorse and  
expressed adamant support for Puerto Rico's independence in a phone 
conversation recorded by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons last April, 
Newsweek reported in its upcoming issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the justice of my people ... my desire has gotten  
stronger,'' Matos said in the conversation, Newsweek said. 
</P>
<P>
	Escobar said parole conditions prohibiting him from associating  
with fellow convicts ``are more proof of our colonial condition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A former art teacher at New York's Museo del Barrio, Escobar  
said he planned to promote Puerto Rican art and culture as a way to 
defend the island's nationality and champion its independence. 
</P>
<P>
	He was undeterred by the minuscule support that cause has in  
Puerto Rico, a territory that has grown relatively rich under 101 
years of U.S. rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Escobar said he did not know that he would be permitted to live  
in Puerto Rico until he was walking out of El Reno prison in 
Oklahoma on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This transition is going to take a lot of time,'' a somewhat  
weary Escobar admitted. ``I feel a great happiness ... but this is 
a very different reality.''

<P>
	DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Police in Dhaka fired tear gas and  
rubber bullets Sunday to disperse nearly 3,000 anti-government 
protesters who exploded crude bombs, attacked government offices 
and set vehicles on fire. At least 150 people were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Burned-out tear gas shells, splinters of homemade bombs, rocks  
and sticks littered downtown streets near government offices after 
more than two hours of fighting between police and protesters. 
Police detained dozens of the protesters. 
</P>
<P>
	The daylong demonstration was organized by the country's main  
opposition parties to press for Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's 
resignation and for fresh elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The parties will begin a three-day nationwide general strike  
from Monday to protest what they described as the roughing up of 
protesters by the police, said opposition spokesman Mohammad 
Kamruzzman. 
</P>
<P>
	Violence broke out as supporters of former Prime Minister  
Khaleda Zia tried to overrun barbed-wire barricades protecting 
government ministries. Mrs. Zia, leader of the Bangladesh 
Nationalist Party, heads the four-party opposition alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	The clashes spread to a nearby neighborhood, and the protesters  
exploded hundreds of tin pots filled with explosives and tried to 
set fire to a gas station. 
</P>
<P>
	The opposition accuses the government of corruption,  
incompetence and harassing political opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasina denied the opposition charge and on Saturday offered to  
hold talks with her rivals. But Mrs. Zia rejected the offer.

<HEADLINE> Jets' Testaverde Hurt, Out of Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- New York Jets quarterback Vinny  
Testaverde injured his Achilles' tendon in the first half of 
Sunday's game against the New England Patriots and was not expected 
to return. 
</P>
<P>
	Testaverde did not get up after being hit during a scramble for  
a fumble. He was limping off the field, using one leg and two 
teammates for support, before he stopped and had to be carried off. 
</P>
<P>
	On the next play, punter Tom Tupa, who's listed on the depth  
chart as the Jets' fourth-string quarterback, threw a perfect 
25-yard touchdown pass to Keyshawn Johnson to give New York a 14-10 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Testaverde completed 10 of 15 passes for 96 yards and a  
touchdown. The 35-year-old quarterback has thrown for 32,575 yards 
and 205 touchdowns in a 13-year NFL career.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts of President Bush Interview </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Selected comments from former President Bush's interview with  
the Fox News Channel show ``The Edge with Paula Zahn,'' scheduled 
for broadcast Monday night: 

</P>
<P>
	--On the effectiveness of NATO intervention in Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	``I think the question should be are the Kosovars better off  
today. And there are far more without homes, and there are far more 
that are within graves, so I don't know that we're better off.'' 

</P>
<P>
	--On U.S. intervention abroad:  
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. should be wary of entering similar conflicts in other  
parts of the world. ... ``Look at East Timor today. I mean, I don't 
think anyone thinks we can go over there and police it and make 
everything be good.'' 

</P>
<P>
	--On being unaware of Chinese spying while he was president and  
vice president: 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not shocked if that's what you mean, but I don't remember  
any specific allegations.'' 

</P>
<P>
	--On the need to improve relations with China:  
</P>
<P>
	``It's probably as important a relationship as to peace in the  
next millennium -- the kind of world your kids are going to grow up 
in -- as any I can think of.'' 

</P>
<P>
	--On potential Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton taking  
positions at odds with her husband's while he still is in office: 
</P>
<P>
	``If I were president and Barbara was out plowing a furrow and  
we were taking different positions, I wouldn't be able to adjust 
very well. Now, maybe President Clinton can.''

<HEADLINE> Fourth Death Probed in NY Outbreak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A fourth death is being investigated in an  
outbreak of mosquito-borne encephalitis that had workers spraying 
insecticide across the city Sunday, including in Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
	A 79-year-old woman who died Saturday was among 10 new suspected  
cases of St. Louis encephalitis, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Blood samples from all 10 are being sent to a Centers for  
Disease Control lab in Denver for testing and at least 80 other 
potential cases are under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials have confirmed nine cases of St. Louis  
encephalitis in New York City, including three deaths -- one in 
Brooklyn and two in Queens. The woman who died Saturday was also 
from Queens. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis encephalitis can cause seizure, paralysis and swelling  
of the brain that is sometimes fatal, especially to infants, the 
elderly and people with immune deficiency. Its symptoms include 
fever, headache and lethargy. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani said Sunday that the mosquito eradication program  
``will continue citywide until we are satisfied that the sources of 
SLE have been found and eliminated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The insecticide being sprayed, malathion, is safe, officials  
said, but they recommended that people and pets remain indoors for 
two to three hours during and after the spraying.

<TEXT>
<P>
	KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) -- After a weekend of violent  
anti-government protests and mass arrests in Karachi, the Pakistani 
government late Sunday announced the release of 200 imprisoned 
opposition leaders and activists. 
</P>
<P>
	Ghous Ali Shah, the chief executive of southern Sindh province,  
of which Karachi is the capital, said the release was meant as a 
goodwill gesture toward the opposition, which is demanding Prime 
Minister Nawaz Sharif's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharif dismissed the Sindh provincial government last year and  
imposed federal rule on the southern province, the stronghold of 
the ethnic based Muttahida Qami Movement and former prime minister 
Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party. 
</P>
<P>
	The MQM and Ms. Bhutto's party have joined a 19-party opposition  
alliance staging countrywide demonstrations to press their demand 
for Sharif's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharif has imposed a two-month ban on demonstrations and strikes  
in southern Sindh province. However, the opposition has issued 
another strike call for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the people being released were arrested on Saturday in  
Karachi when police waged a bitter battle with opposition 
supporters trying to stage a rally. Hundreds of people were 
arrested at the rally. The opposition said 6,000 people were 
arrested, a charge denied by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hyderabad, about 70 miles north of Karachi, police and  
opposition supporters clashed Sunday after police stopped lawmakers 
from Ms. Bhutto's party from staging a sit-in and token hunger 
strike, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police in Hyderabad, a city of 3 million people, used water  
cannons and fired dozens of tear gas shells into the crowd and beat 
opposition supporters with iron-tipped sticks, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 50 people, including two lawmakers of Ms. Bhutto were  
arrested, said Naveed Qamar, a party spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nawaz Sharif continues to show the people . . . that he is a  
brutal, bloody dictator,'' Ms. Bhutto said in a statement from 
London, where she is living in self-imposed exile. ``The Nawaz 
regime is using a brutal force to suppress democracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The opposition accuses Sharif of corruption, favoritism and  
undermining the constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharif denies the allegations and says the opposition wants to  
destabilize the country.

<HEADLINE>  Four Sentenced To Death in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Four people have been  
sentenced to death in connection with weeklong demonstrations in 
Iran in July, a senior judge said in comments published Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gholamhossein Rahbarpour, the head of Tehran's Revolutionary  
Courts, said that others were also under investigation for ``heavy 
charges,'' the hard-line Jomhuri Eslami daily reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far four persons have been sentenced to death in relation  
to the riots in Tehran,'' the paper quoted Rahbarpour as saying. 
``The verdicts for two of them have been verified by the Supreme 
Court and the cases of the other two are still being studied by the 
Supreme Court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The paper quoted him as saying that 45 people were given  
unspecified jail terms. 
</P>
<P>
	The closure of a moderate newspaper and a July 9 police raid on  
a university dormitory, which left one person dead and 20 injured, 
triggered the worst unrest in Iran in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Tens of thousands of students held street protests against  
hard-liners who dominate the government. At least two more people 
were killed in the protests. 
</P>
<P>
	Hard-liners quelled the unrest by ordering a crackdown and  
arresting some 1,500 people. Rahbarpour said 500 were later freed 
and 800 were released on bail but are under investigation. He said 
200 of the ``main suspects'' were still in prison, some of whom 
have received unspecified sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	The unrest was part of a larger power struggle between hard-line  
officials and moderates allied with President Mohammad Khatami.

<HEADLINE> 2 Pilots Killed in Air Show Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- Two airplanes collided Sunday at an  
air show, killing both pilots, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Cessnas, both Vietnam War vintage planes, were flying west  
in close formation when one clipped the other and they crashed to 
the ground, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appeared they both attempted to do a roll and the wings  
clipped,'' said an ambulance service official, Bill 
England-Horsfall. ``At that time, parts of the wings went flying 
and both planes came down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The accident near Harriman-West Airport in North Adams occurred  
30 minutes into the show commemorating the airport's 50th 
anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
	The planes landed a distance from a crowd of several thousand  
and no onlookers were injured. The pilots were declared dead at the 
scene. Their identities were not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators were on the scene, in northwest Massachusetts near  
the Vermont line.

	DETROIT (AP) -- Toronto Blue Jays outfielder Shannon Stewart had  
to leave Sunday's game with the Detroit Tigers after an apparent 
injury to his right knee in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart was examined by Tigers team physician Dr. Kyle Anderson,  
who found no ligament damage. Stewart is listed as day-to-day. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart was trying to beat out a leadoff infield grounder. He  
stretched out his right leg as he approached first base and hit the 
bag with his heel, apparently putting most of his weight on the 
knee. He was called out on a close play and immediately collapsed 
on the field before being helped off.

<HEADLINE> Bush: Son Right on Drug Non-Answer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former President Bush says son George was a  
``rambunctious'' youngster who never gave his parents reason to 
believe he used drugs and is right not to answer further questions 
about the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Bush is not advising George W. Bush's 2000  
presidential campaign -- ``I don't want to always be in the game 
anymore.'' He also hopes Americans elect someone who can live up to 
``the very high standards'' for the White House that Bush said Bill 
Clinton has failed to meet. 
</P>
<P>
	The former president, defeated by Clinton in 1992, discussed  
varied topics in a television interview from his family home in 
Kennebunkport, Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	A transcript was released before its scheduled broadcast Monday  
night on the Fox News Channel show ``The Edge with Paula Zahn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``All this stuff about George's totally irresponsible past, we  
never saw it,'' the ex-president said. ``Barbara and I never saw 
this. We knew he had some problems but -- that he faced up to, but 
no different than most kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Bush, the Republican governor of Texas, was ``a  
rambunctious little guy'' and his father recalled an episode when 
the youngster tried to hit him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just held him at arm's length -- he was about nine -- just  
flailing away at me,'' Bush said. ``He didn't like some decision I 
had made, a leadership decision, I'm sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Bush has acknowledged that at one time he drank  
heavily and that he made ``mistakes'' in his youth. No evidence or 
even credible allegation has been made that he ever used cocaine or 
any other illegal drug. 
</P>
<P>
	When pressed, he has said he had not used illegal drugs in the  
past 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	His father said he is upset how the media have questioned his  
son about rumors of cocaine use, and believes it is right for him 
not to answer more questions on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do feel strongly about that, about gotcha politics, about  
intrusiveness,'' Bush said. ``And I think I'm very proud that he's 
with that position and let the voters decide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former president said he has not asked his son whether he  
ever used drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't even consider to do that,'' Bush said. ``I think  
what he's doing is correct and he has my full support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barbara Bush said last month she and her husband never asked  
their eldest son if he used cocaine. ``We had no need to,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The former president said that while offering sympathy, he has  
tried to avoid giving political advice to his sons -- even shying 
away from public comments on some topics lest his opinions cause 
them trouble. Another son, Jeb, is governor of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had my chance on those issues,'' Bush said. ``I still read  
up everything, try to stay up to date, but I don't -- I don't want 
to always be in the game anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did discuss next year's presidential election in general  
terms: ``I just hope and believe that the American people are going 
to want to see standards very high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I just have a great respect for the office itself. And I'm  
afraid President Clinton hasn't lived up to very high standards in 
that regard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former president has been working on a book of his letters,  
to be published in October and titled ``All The Best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It will include personal letters such as the ones he wrote to  
his family as a World War II Navy pilot. Others have historical 
significance -- to the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping at the time 
of the Tiananmen Square massacre and a farewell when Soviet 
President Mikhail Gorbachev left office.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was higher against the yen early Monday  
amid lingering concern over possible further central bank 
intervention. Japanese stocks rose moderately. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 109.14 yen in early trading, up 0.22 yen from  
late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late level Friday in New 
York of 108.81 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 99.48 points,  
or 0.56 percent, to 17,810.50 in the first 30 minutes of trading. 
On Friday, the average closed up 33.46 points, or 0.19 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar gained some ground against the  
yen in quiet early Asian trading as fears of more intervention by 
Japan's central bank were keeping a lid on the yen's strength for 
the time being. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the Bank of Japan intervened repeatedly to buy the  
U.S. currency to stem the yen's advance, moderately helping the 
dollar recover from a three-year low. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen has been in demand in recent weeks amid some signs that  
Japan's economy is improving. The government said Thursday that the 
nation's economy grew at an annual rate of 0.9 percent in the 
April-June quarter of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 112.86 yen, down  
from 115.15 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices started moderately higher as players  
were encouraged by a rise in Nikkei futures in Chicago on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Issues of major electronics makers, including NEC Corp., led the  
way in line with Friday's record-high rally in the technology-rich 
Nasdaq Composite Index on Wall Street, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 50.97 points  
to close Friday at 11,028.43. The Nasdaq composite index, however, 
rose 34.94 points to 2,886.96 to surpass its previous closing 
record finish of 2,864.48 set July 16. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 9.67 points, or 0.64 percent, to 1,524.53. On 
Friday, the TOPIX closed up 7.24 points, or 0.48 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell  
to 101.06 percent from Friday's finish of 1.7750 percent. Its 
prices rose 0.17 point to 101.06.

<HEADLINE> Florida Black-Owned Bank Shut Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The state's only black-owned bank was seized by  
federal regulators and its deposits and loans sold to a 
Boston-based bank, ending a long struggle for survival. 
</P>
<P>
	Peoples National Bank was critically undercapitalized when  
federal regulators closed the 39-year-old bank's doors Friday. Its 
capital was below 2 percent of assets as required by banking law. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank, which also had a branch in Lauderdale Lakes, will open  
Monday as Boston Bank of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be no disruption of service,'' said Janis Smith, a  
spokeswoman of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. ``All 
accounts and loans will be transferred.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bank was using unsafe and unsound banking practices,  
suffered from poor lending practices, improper record-keeping and 
accounting, and ineffective board and management supervision, 
regulators said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company lost $4.1 million in 1997, $3.4 million in 1998 and  
$254,000 the first quarter of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank's ability to survive had long been in question while it  
fought mounting losses and tried to find new investors to replenish 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the bank's recent troubles were the result of bad loans,  
mostly dealer-arranged car loans related to bank director William 
Armstrong's auto sales business. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal regulators placed Peoples under a consent order in  
February 1997, requiring the bank to revamp its lending practices 
and record-keeping. 
</P>
<P>
	That order also required the bank to stop making indirect auto  
loans until it disposed of those that were delinquent and developed 
a more thorough selection process for borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank had $37.6 million in assets and total deposits of $36.1  
million by the end of the day Friday. It was placed under the 
receivership of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston Bank of Commerce then purchased $34 million of the failed  
bank's assets at a discount of $1.8 million. The FDIC said it will 
retain the remaining $3.6 million in assets for later disposition.

<TEXT>
<P>
	HERTFORD, N.C. (AP) -- Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter probably would have  
despised this -- people dressed in suits making a fuss over him. 
</P>
<P>
	He was buried Sunday several hundred yards from the high school  
field where he began a baseball career that would send him to the 
Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,000 family, friends and former major league  
teammates turned out for the funeral of the pitcher who won five 
World Series titles with the Oakland Athletics and New York 
Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	The 53-year-old Hunter died Thursday, one year after learning he  
had Lou Gehrig's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Former teammate and Seattle manager Lou Piniella missed his  
team's game in Baltimore to attend the service at Cedarwood 
Cemetery. Other former teammates in attendance included A's Joe 
Rudi, Vida Blue, Gene Tenace and ``Blue Moon'' Odom, and Yankees 
Ron Guidry and Reggie Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees sent general manager Brian Cashman and former  
manager and scout Gene Michael as their representative. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was looking forward to spending time with Catfish after the  
season. It didn't quite get to that,'' said Piniella, his eyes 
teary. ``My wife and I and my young son are here to pay tribute to 
him. He was a great guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 15-year-old Hertford boy stood outside the cemetery gate  
wearing a Yankees hat as the hearse carrying Hunter's drove by. 
Players placed flowers on Hunter's casket as they filed out of the 
cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite being baseball's first big free agent, Hunter always  
returned to this small eastern North Carolina town to live, and 
eventually retire. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like taking out a part of your body, like ripping out  
your heart,'' former high school teammate Eddie Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Crawford drove about 70 miles from Virginia Beach to stop  
by the cemetery and walk past Hunter's marble shrine on the town's 
main street, which had flowers sprawled along it's base. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not much into baseball. I just know the man and I  
understand he was a great guy,'' Crawford said. ``I heard he was 
just a straight and honest man, and had one hellacious career as a 
pitcher. I just thought I would come down to see where he lived.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In one store, there was a baseball autographed by Hunter that  
had a sticker on the outside of the plastic case that read: ``Ball 
not for sale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most striking floral arrangement at Hertford Baptist Church  
came from Hunter's three children and grandchild. It was a huge 
baseball arrangement with white mums and roses as the seams of the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Another arrangement at the church came from the family of late  
A's owner Charlie O. Finley, who signed Hunter and brought him 
right to the majors without a day spent in the minors. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter was unconscious for several days last month after falling  
and hitting his head on concrete steps. But he improved and was 
sent home to his Perquimans County farm on Saturday. However, he 
died in less than a week. 
</P>
<P>
	As the centerpiece of pitching staffs, first with the Athletics  
and then with the Yankees, Hunter won 224 games, produced five 
straight 20-victory seasons, a perfect game and a Cy Young Award. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Keith Vaughan eulogized Hunter as a common man who  
cared deeply for others. 
</P>
<P>
	``He never ever acted as if he was too busy for us. He never  
acted like we were a bother to him -- I know sometimes we probably 
were,'' Vaughan said. ``He never ever gave into the fact that he 
was famous and we weren't. He could just as easily slammed the door 
on us and told us to go on our way. That's not the kind of man he 
was. 
</P>
<P>
	``In all of my ministry this is perhaps the toughest day I have  
ever had because all of my life Catfish Hunter was my hero.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter was the second Yankees Hall of Famer to die this year.  
Joe DiMaggio died March 8 at 84. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like: `Am I dreaming or is this real?''' said Francis  
Combs, Hunter's high school catcher and pall bearer. ``It just 
feels like it's a dream. It's going to seem funny to go to his 
house and he's not going to be there.''

<HEADLINE> Myths About Antibacterial Soaps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HIGH POINT, N.C. (AP) -- Popular antibacterial hand soaps provide  
extra protection against nasty germs like staph, E. coli and 
salmonella, but they aren't new, they don't sterilize hands and 
they aren't approved by the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, consumers have made antibacterials a big business.  
Last year, retailers sold about $400 million worth of antibacterial 
hand soap. 
</P>
<P>
	Half the dish soaps on grocery shelves bear antibacterial  
labels. Antibacterial agents also are used in toothpaste as well as 
in cleaners for fabrics, rugs, kitchen counters and toilet bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	For all that, many experts say thorough handwashing with regular  
soap is still the best way to clean hands and prevent the spread of 
disease. Moreover, some are concerned that antibacterials might 
lead to development of bacteria-resistant strains. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's important is washing your hands,'' said William  
Schaffner, chairman of the department of preventive medicine at 
Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. ``What's less important 
is what you use.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Purported germ-killing soaps have been on the market since the  
1920s, according to the Soap and Detergent Association. Hospitals 
have used germ-killing scrubs for many years. 
</P>
<P>
	Only in recent years has the term ``antibacterial'' become a  
buzzword in the soap products industry, said Keith Hostetler, vice 
president of Ciba Specialty Chemicals' antibacterial products 
division in High Point. 
</P>
<P>
	Swiss-based Ciba makes Triclosan, a bacteria-killer and -growth  
inhibitor created in 1965 and found in antibacterial soaps sold by 
companies such as Dial, Colgate-Palmolive and Bath and Body Works. 
Ciba first used Triclosan in laundry detergent to fight 
odor-causing bacteria, Hostetler said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1970s saw the advent of germ-killing soaps like Irish Spring  
and Life Buoy, but most did not bear an antibacterial label. 
</P>
<P>
	Liquid Dial, with an antibacterial formulation and label, was  
introduced in 1986, said Dial spokeswoman Nancy Stern. It was the 
first liquid antibacterial soap. 
</P>
<P>
	Dial began stamping its bar soap with antibacterial labels in  
the early 1990s without changing the makeup of the soap, which had 
been around since 1972, according to Janet Donohue, a spokeswoman 
at the Soap and Detergent Association. That practice is acceptable 
so long as companies reapply with the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Other companies began introducing antibacterial soap three to  
four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Antibacterial products are catching on because people travel  
more and use public transportation, more children go to day-care 
centers, and hospital patients are being released more quickly, 
Donohue said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the public likes it. I personally like the  
antibacterial soap. Why would I take the risk if I have the option 
(of using antibacterial soap),'' said Barbara Jorgensen, a 
spokeswoman at Bath and Body Works. Owned by The Limited, the store 
introduced antibacterial hand soap in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	While antibacterial product-makers acknowledge regular soap  
works, too -- by washing away germs -- they say their products kill 
the germs and stop bacteria growth for as long as six hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Hostetler said Triclosan adds staying power to soap, which is  
important because most people either don't wash their hands at all 
or enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a convenience, an extra level of protection,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In a test at Ciba that shows the long-lasting effect of the  
product, a volunteer washed her hands with liquid soap and then 
placed her fingers in a petri dish teeming with staph bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	She returned to the lab two, four and six hours later to repeat  
the test without washing her hands. When the petri dishes were 
examined 24 hours later, researchers found the bacteria was killed 
in the areas touched by the volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts, however, say it is impossible to kill all the germs on  
hands. 
</P>
<P>
	While Triclosan slows bacterial growth, bacteria always grows  
back, said Ralph Raasch, associate professor in the school of 
pharmacy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	``The skin has lots of bacteria on it. It's very difficult ...  
to totally destroy the population with any chemical,'' Raasch said. 
</P>
<P>
	A study last year by Tufts University showed antibacterial  
agents and antibiotics might even cause bacteria to become 
resistant. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the  
American Medical Association do not support or criticize use of 
antibacterial soaps, but favor a good handwashing with regular soap 
and water to prevent the spread of disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Antibacterial soaps fall into a gray regulatory area. The FDA  
hasn't weighed in yet with standards and approvals pending further 
study. Hostetler said antibacterial manufacturers tend to follow 
standards last proposed by the FDA in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	While conceding antibacterials do not sterilize the skin,  
Hostetler says they control bacterial growth. ``Less bacteria is 
better than more bacteria.''

<HEADLINE> Georgia Tech Back Out for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Georgia Tech lost running back Joe Burns for the  
season when he broke his right ankle Saturday night in the Yellow 
Jackets' 41-35 loss at top-ranked Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
	Burns, a sophomore, sustained the injury after making a 14-yard  
run in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a heartbreaker,'' said coach George O'Leary, whose  
Yellow Jackets fell to No. 12 in the Associated Press poll. ``He 
took the pitch on the option and turned the corner, but he got 
caught from behind and his leg buckled as the guy came over the 
top. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll be out for the year. Hopefully we can put in for a  
medical redshirt year because it occurred before the third game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Listed as a co-starter with senior Phillip Rogers, Burns is  
Tech's third-leading rusher with 87 yards on 14 carries (6.2 yard 
average) and second-leading receiver with seven catches for 96 
yards a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	He led Georgia Tech (1-1) with 474 yards rushing and five  
touchdowns last season.

<HEADLINE> Griese Leads Broncos Against Miami </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- In a game in which Broncos quarterback Brian  
Griese will make first NFL start, Dan Marino will make his 230th. 
</P>
<P>
	The Miami quarterback remembers his first start and understands  
the obstacles facing Griese -- even though Marino, unlike most young 
quarterbacks, never seemed to experience any growing pains. 
</P>
<P>
	In his rookie year in 1983, he started against Buffalo in the  
sixth game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe Ferguson was the quarterback of the Bills and we lost in  
overtime,'' Marino recalled. ``I had a pretty good day, actually.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He completed 19 of 29 passes for 322 yards and three touchdowns  
with two interceptions. From that point, there was no dislodging 
him from the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	Marino, the NFL leader in passing yardage (58,913) and touchdown  
passes (408), begins his 17th season Monday night at Mile High 
Stadium against the two-time defending Super Bowl champion Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	The only gap in his resume is the absence of a Super Bowl title,  
something his counterpart, John Elway, didn't achieve until his 
final two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel I have accomplished pretty much everything any  
quarterback could accomplish individually,'' he said. ``I've been 
very consistent for a long period of time and have had a great 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, I want to know what it feels like to win a Super  
Bowl. I don't know if there will be a huge hole in my career 
because you have to be with the right team and have chances to win 
it. Hopefully, I will have that opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marino, who turns 38 on Wednesday, has given no serious thought  
to retiring, as Elway did last spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this stage of my career, you have to take it one year at a  
time and see how your body feels, see what kind of team you have, 
whether you have a chance to win or not, what your family situation 
is,'' he said. ``But right now, I haven't really thought much about 
retiring. The season is just getting started, and I'm really 
looking forward to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins, he said, ``have a chance to be a much better team  
than we've had the last couple of years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday night, he faces a 24-year-old quarterback in his  
second year in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, I don't feel old at all going against younger guys,''  
Griese said. ``In fact, it makes me feel a lot younger, especially 
in the locker room. We all have one thing in common; we all play 
football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griese is the son of Miami's other great quarterback, Hall of  
Famer Bob Griese, but that doesn't mean Marino has offered any 
advice. He does, however, know some of the pitfalls that a young 
quarterback must face. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is probably the hardest job in professional  
sports, team sports anyway,'' Marino said. ``The more experience 
you get, the better you are. The way defenses are changing, it's a 
lot more complicated to play this position than it was 15 years 
ago. With all the things going on, it's very tough for a young guy. 
</P>
<P>
	``But Brian is not a rookie. He's been there a year. He's been  
able to watch John, a guy he could learn a lot from. And he has an 
excellent coach. I'm sure he will be well prepared and do a good 
job for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marino will be in the locker room at halftime Monday night when  
Elway, a longtime friend, has his jersey retired and is inducted 
into the Broncos' Ring of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, I won't be around when it happens,'' he said. ``But  
I respect John immensely. He's a friend and he deserves everything 
they do for him.''

<HEADLINE> New ABC Set a Shot in Morning Wars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- From behind the flashing lights and custom-made  
windows of a new studio jutting 20 feet into Times Square, ``Good 
Morning America'' anchors Charles Gibson and Diane Sawyer can see 
just what they're up against. 
</P>
<P>
	A giant Astrovision screen a block in front of them beams their  
competition: NBC's top-rated ``Today'' show. 
</P>
<P>
	Over Gibson's right shoulder, a viewer can spot the Viacom  
building where, theoretically, the company that just bought CBS can 
hang a banner advertising the Tiffany network's soon-to-premiere 
``Early Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They wouldn't think of it, would they?'' Gibson asked with a  
smile. 
</P>
<P>
	Better believe it, Charlie. This is war. Monday's debut of ABC's  
glitzy studio is the latest evidence of how morning news shows have 
become network television's lucrative new battleground. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the place to be,'' said CBS's Jane Clayson. ``The  
competition is fierce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CBS last week chose Clayson, a former ABC News correspondent, to  
be Bryant Gumbel's new partner in the morning. Gumbel, the former 
``Today'' host, was lured back to morning TV after CBS promised to 
spend up to $30 million to build its own storefront studio 
overlooking New York's Central Park. The ``Early Show'' bows on 
Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	It is CBS's boldest effort yet to end its perpetual doormat  
status in the morning. The immediate target is ``Good Morning 
America,'' still within striking distance despite ending a long 
slide in the ratings when Sawyer and Gibson were brought in. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's new studio, complete with a 32-foot-high outdoor jumbo TV  
screen and a replica of a New York City subway station, is evidence 
it won't back down. ABC isn't saying how much was spent on the 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
	The success of ``Today'' explains all the activity. NBC has  
taken advantage of Americans' tendency to get up earlier, and turn 
on the TV when they do. The show's audience increased for four 
straight years before holding steady this year. 
</P>
<P>
	That's no mean feat in an era when TV viewership is declining.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's exhilarating to see that the only growth area in network  
television is in the mornings now,'' said Phyllis McGrady, the ABC 
executive who oversees ``Good Morning America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With networks scrambling to stay even, ``Today'' cleared $100  
million in profits for NBC last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been very fortunate,'' said Jeff Zucker, executive  
producer of ``Today.'' ``We've been on top for five years and it's 
a great position to be in. But it's also tough, because you have to 
deliver day after day. It would be easy to get complacent. But the 
competition won't allow it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The high stakes have brought a willingness to spend money, but  
also a certain conservatism. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon, NBC, ABC and CBS will all have morning news shows with  
Manhattan studios where passersby can peer in and wave at the 
cameras (the cable Fox News Channel makes it four). Each will have 
male and female co-hosts, with a black man reporting the weather. 
Each will offer a mix of news and features. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Heyward, CBS News president, said morning viewers want an  
update on what happened overnight, personalities they can feel 
comfortable with and information useful to their lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``You fail to do any of these things at your own peril,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The networks all have individual challenges. Clayson is  
unproven, and CBS hopes the love-hate relationship many viewers 
have with Gumbel veers toward the former. ABC hasn't established 
replacements for Gibson and Sawyer, who both say they're working 
temporarily in the morning. NBC has to guard against becoming smug 
with success. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are the ones that will continue to push the envelope,''  
Zucker said. ``It's just that ABC and CBS are trying to have what 
we had five years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's not afraid to tweak the competition. The Times Square  
Astrovision used to air stock reports and other fare in the morning 
before Zucker made a phone call. And -- voila! -- starting Monday 
``Today'' will be shown where his friends from ``GMA'' can see it. 
</P>
<P>
	Why the change?  
</P>
<P>
	``Because we can,'' Zucker said.

<HEADLINE>  El Salvador Floods Force Evacuations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN CARLOS LEMPA, El Salvador (AP) -- Police, soldiers and rescue  
teams evacuated hundreds of families Sunday from communities 
threatened by flooding along El Salvador's Lempa River. 
</P>
<P>
	Intense rains that began Friday killed at least one person,  
flooded the homes of some 5,000 people and caused damage in five of 
El Salvador's 14 provinces, Red Cross and Salvadoran emergency 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The greatest impact was felt in the lower Lempa region, home to  
about 15 communities lying along the river, which crosses central 
El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
	The river rose about a yard, said Agustina Rosales, 51, who was  
resting in a shelter set up in a school in San Carlos Lempa, 60 
miles southeast of San Salvador, the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the help of army trucks they got us out of there,''  
Rosales said. 
</P>
<P>
	The school served as the temporary home for some 400 people  
evacuated from the nearby town of Santa Marta, which was completely 
flooded Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Cross spokesman Carlos Lopez Mendoza said some 5,000 people  
had been affected by the flooding. An elderly man died Sunday when 
rains caused a wall to collapse on his small home in Fosa, north of 
the capital, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Erick Aragon, a member of the National Emergency Committee, said  
300 people were evacuated from at least eight communities in the 
central province of San Vicente. 
</P>
<P>
	At least two towns had been left isolated by the intense rains,  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 100 families were evacuated from homes near the overflowing  
Paz River, which divides El Salvador from Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
	The affected areas also suffered severe flooding last year  
during Hurricane Mitch, which killed more than 9,000 people across 
Central American and destroyed tens of thousands of homes.

<HEADLINE> Bombardier Unveils Cleaner Craft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- The world's leading boat maker has unveiled a  
new line of personal watercraft designed to be cleaner and quieter 
to quell increasing environmental concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of next year's Sea-Doo models are being showcased by  
Montreal-based Bombardier Recreational Products at its annual 
dealer meeting, which ends Monday at the Silver Legacy and Eldorado 
hotel-casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are committed to working proactively with regulatory  
agencies and environmental groups in ensuring our products are 
responsible,'' said Henry Lonski, Sea-Doo watercraft vice 
president. ``We encourage the rest of the industry to follow our 
lead in developing cleaner products that reduce emissions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Branded as noisy polluters by environmentalists, personal  
watercraft such as Sea-Doos and Kawasaki's Jet Ski brand have 
become the target of crackdowns at Lake Tahoe and other waterways 
in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lonski hailed his new models' Orbital Direct Injection  
technology, saying it will allow them to reduce emissions by up to 
70 percent and improve fuel efficiency by up to 30 percent over 
traditional carbureted two-stroke engines. 
</P>
<P>
	Bombardier spokeswoman Jan Hall said all four models will be  
allowed at nearby Lake Tahoe under tough, new environmental 
restrictions that went into effect there June 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tahoe Regional Planning Agency imposed an ordinance  
prohibiting two-stroke engines that power most personal watercraft. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Fourth Death Probed in NY Outbreak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A fourth death is being investigated in an  
outbreak of mosquito-borne encephalitis that had workers spraying 
insecticide across the city Sunday, including in Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
	A 79-year-old woman who died Saturday was among 10 new suspected  
cases of St. Louis encephalitis, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Blood samples from all 10 are being sent to a Centers for  
Disease Control lab in Denver for testing and at least 80 other 
potential cases are under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials have confirmed nine cases of St. Louis  
encephalitis in New York City, including three deaths -- one in 
Brooklyn and two in Queens. The woman who died Saturday was also 
from Queens. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis encephalitis can cause seizure, paralysis and swelling  
of the brain that is sometimes fatal, especially to infants, the 
elderly and people with immune deficiency. Its symptoms include 
fever, headache and lethargy. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani said Sunday that the mosquito eradication program  
``will continue citywide until we are satisfied that the sources of 
SLE have been found and eliminated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The insecticide being sprayed, malathion, is safe, officials  
said, but they recommended that people and pets remain indoors for 
two to three hours during and after the spraying.

<HEADLINE> E. coli Sickens More Than 200 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PETERSBURG, Ill. (AP) -- E. coli bacteria linked to a cow-pasture  
party has sickened more than 200 people, and the numbers are 
continuing to rise, health officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,800 people attended the Sept. 4 party. E. coli  
typically has an incubation period of three to eight days, but can 
take longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have not pinpointed the source of the potentially  
fatal strain of E. coli, found in the feces and intestines of 
cattle. Twenty people have been hospitalized, but none of the 
reported illnesses was considered serious, said Thomas Schafer, a 
spokesman for the Illinois Department of Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
	The pasture's owner, Tom Baird, said he cleaned it of manure  
before the party. 
</P>
<P>
	The party was a free gathering for family and friends of members  
of eight bands, with guests coming from Illinois, Florida, Hawaii, 
Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri and Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	The same strain of E. coli was linked to an outbreak at a county  
fair in upstate New York last month. New York health officials said 
Sunday that 751 suspected cases of E. coli were traced to the 
Washington County Fair and 93 cases, including two deaths, were 
confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials believe contaminated well water was the source,  
but scientists were still trying to find a definitive link. 
</P>
<P>
	The country's worst E. coli outbreak was in 1993 when 700  
patrons of Jack in the Box restaurants in Washington state became 
sick with E. coli symptoms. Four deaths and about 500 illnesses 
were confirmed.

<HEADLINE> Father of Yankees' Brosius Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Scott Brosius knew the call would soon come. He  
got it Sunday in the Yankee Stadium clubhouse, an hour before 
gametime. 
</P>
<P>
	Maury Brosius, who watched his son win the MVP award of the 1998  
World Series, had died of colon cancer back home in McMinnville, 
Ore. He was 55. 
</P>
<P>
	Brosius started at third base against Boston and went 1-for-2 in  
a 4-1 loss to the Red Sox. He also was hit by a pitch and picked 
off second base, and was flawless in the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just felt it was right to play today,'' he said. ``I felt  
there's nothing I could do by not playing. But it was pretty tough 
out there at times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brosius planned to accompany the team to Toronto for a  
three-game series that begins Monday night. He said he would return 
to Oregon for the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	Maury Brosius was diagnosed with cancer last year. His son  
missed five games from Aug. 29 to Sept. 2 to visit his dad. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was our chance to say the things we wanted to say, to  
have conversations while we still could have them,'' Brosius said. 
``We got to have the closure we both wanted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But when you're leaving the house and understanding it's the  
last time you'll see your father alive, it's not easy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Brosius hit .300 with 19 home runs and 98 RBIs in the  
regular season. With his father attending the final two games at 
San Diego, Brosius hit .471 with two homers and six RBIs in the 
World Series sweep against the San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	Brosius, 33, has struggled this year, batting .250 with 14 home  
runs and 65 RBIs. He recently ended an 0-for-28 slump that was the 
worst skid by a Yankees hitter in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	Brosius started Sunday's game hitless in 11 at-bats and in a  
1-for-21 slump. He was hit by a pitch in his first plate appearance 
and singled off Bret Saberhagen the next time up. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some ways, the last seven, eight days have been the  
toughest,'' Brosius said. ``You're thinking about him and what he's 
going through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He was ready; he was very peaceful,'' Brosius said. ``As sad  
as it is, there's a sense of peace that his pain is finally over.''

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Might Be Reform Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- GOP presidential contender Pat Buchanan came  
closer than ever Sunday to saying he would quit the Republican race 
and campaign for the Reform Party's nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``The door really is wide open,'' Buchanan said. ``We are very  
close to making that decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For weeks, the Reform Party's Jesse Ventura, the Minnesota  
governor, has discounted suggestions the party should nominate 
Buchanan for president. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura has said the party founded by Ross Perot is based on  
conservative economic principles, not Buchanan's social 
conservatism on abortion and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
	As recently as Friday, the Capitol Hill newspaper The Hill  
published an interview in which the governor ruled out ``a retread 
from another campaign or another party'' as the Reform Party's 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	But Buchanan, appearing on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' said his  
sister and campaign adviser, Bay Buchanan, is ``talking ... to 
people in the Reform Party'' for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are taking a hard look at leaving the Republican nomination  
run and running for the Reform Party nomination,'' Buchanan said. 
``The decision has not been made yet ... but I tell you honestly we 
are leaning in that direction right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A telephone call to the party chairman-elect, Jack Gargan of  
Cedar Key, Fla., went unanswered Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan said he is being swayed by the belief that ``my party  
at the national level has become a Xerox copy basically of the 
Democratic Party. ... I think what we have is a one-party system in 
Washington that is masquerading as a two-party system, and I think 
what we need is a real opposition party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of a third-party candidacy by Buchanan is making the  
Republican front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, nervous, Time 
magazine reported in its issue on newsstands Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	It said a private poll conducted by Frank Luntz, a GOP  
consultant, found Buchanan would win 6 percent of the vote in a 
three-way contest with Bush and Vice President Al Gore, leading for 
the Democratic nomination. Two-thirds of the Buchanan vote, the 
poll indicated, would come from Bush supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush aides last week discussed ``how to make Buchanan feel  
wanted in the GOP'' and a senior Bush adviser told Time: ``We're 
surrounding him with love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Republican candidate, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said on  
CNN's ``Late Edition'' he hopes Buchanan decides to stay a 
Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	``He represents a wing of our party, in fact he represents a  
viewpoint, that I thoroughly disagree with,'' McCain said, but ``we 
need to have that debate within the party.''

<HEADLINE> Dawgs Happy To Be Back in Cleveland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Before Dawg Pounders let out their first bark  
or threw back their first beers, they already knew the result of 
Sunday's night game with the Pittsburgh Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
	They won.  
</P>
<P>
	After three seasons without football and having their Cleveland  
Browns stolen out from under them, it was all over Sunday. They had 
survived, won back their team and their colors as the season -- the 
real season, no exhibition game -- finally got underway against the 
archival Steelers. It was time to party. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a bunch of crazed dogs and we're battling back,'' said  
Kevin Hepburn as he and his buddy, Jim Istenes, tied up their 
motorboat ``Sick Puppy'' at a dock on Lake Erie just outside the 
stadium. ``I've been sad since they moved. We've been waiting a 
long time. But this is brand new.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Downtown Cleveland was awash in orange, brown and goofy outfits  
a full four hours before kickoff, the first regular-season home 
game for the Browns since December 1995. Scalpers got $200 for 
tickets and were asking as much as $500, fans said. 
</P>
<P>
	In parking lots stretching more than a mile from the new  
stadium, people set up camp behind cars, trucks, buses and vans, 
firing up their grills and cracking open a few cold drinks. All the 
Clevelanders were loving their Browns and ready to celebrate with 
anybody wearing a dog bone. 
</P>
<P>
	A band of folks with seats in the Dawg Pound, the end zone  
section that's the domain of the Browns most rabid faithful, hung 
out in a private lot close to the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	When they saw a truck driving by with a couch in the back --  
painted orange with brown and white stripes like Cleveland's helmet 
and the words ``Tim Couch'' emblazoned on it -- they called the 
driver over and offered a free parking spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our No. 1 draft pick!'' yelled Dave Bletsh as a couple of guys  
unloaded the couch and joined the party. ``We had to have that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The couch artist, Tim Johnson, was dressed head-to-toe in orange  
and brown and wore slippers that looked like footballs on his feet. 
He talked about what made him repaint his tan sofa in honor of 
Cleveland's rookie quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just came right in my head,'' he said. ``I didn't think  
anybody else would do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a parking lot on the other side of the stadium, Tuck Leckey  
showed off a tattoo of a helmeted dog he got just for the game. 
Leckey and his friend, Terry Doseck, drove up to Cleveland from 
southwest Ohio without tickets, but picked them up for $200 each. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been a Browns fan all my life, and I just got this,'' he  
said. ``It's not done yet. We're going to fence him in and put a 
collar on him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Everybody was glad that when the Browns finally came back, it  
was against the Steelers. Even Pittsburgh fans were happy to see 
the rivalry renewed in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had a lot of garbage rain down on me already,'' said Roy  
Lane, sporting a Kordell Stewart jersey. ``But that's all right. 
It's been a long time and we're glad to have them back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bletsh agreed. ``It's Pittsburgh and Cleveland and nothing  
else,'' he said. ``There is no other rivalry.''

<HEADLINE> Photos Help Breast Cancer Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HERSHEY, Pa. (AP) -- All the women bear the scars of breast  
cancer, some slight, others extensive. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost all pose with their tops off to give a realistic picture  
of what surgery has done to their bodies. When they do, they smile 
for the camera. 
</P>
<P>
	Such are the images in ``Show Me: A Photo Collection of Breast  
Cancer Survivors' Lumpectomies, Mastectomies, Breast 
Reconstructions and Thoughts on Body Image.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the book distributed among organizations that help  
breast-cancer patients, 23 volunteers share their experiences, 
including photos of themselves, for the sake of other women who 
face life-altering decisions about breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the breast cancer support group at the Milton S.  
Hershey Medical Center and a few patients from outside the group 
conceived, wrote, edited and posed for the publication. Their goal 
was to share the kind of personal experience that can only be 
passed from one breast cancer patient to another. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't pull any punches and make this sound rosy and  
sweet,'' said Vicki Gingrich, who underwent a mastectomy in 1991. 
``But we really wanted women to understand that we're OK with 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The photographs in the book show a college adviser, an artist --  
even an assistant in the governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
	One woman advises patients to ask a lot of questions, even  
repeatedly. A second reports that her scars are fading after three 
years. A third says she opted for reconstructive surgery because 
she found it uncomfortable either to wear prostheses or to go 
without them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't hesitate to gather your family, your friends, and God  
and his angels around you'' is the advice of Nancy L. Shelly, a 
library cataloguer. 
</P>
<P>
	The book's intended readers are contending with such questions  
as whether to have a mastectomy or a less-invasive lumpectomy, or 
whether to undergo reconstructive surgery. A lumpectomy involves 
removal of a malignant lesion from the breast while preserving its 
essential anatomy, while a mastectomy requires removal of the 
entire breast and neighboring tissue. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes medical circumstances all but dictate which procedure  
doctors use. But in other situations, patients may have to balance 
issues like risk of recurrence against appearance and physical 
comfort. 
</P>
<P>
	The book had its genesis about 2 1/2 years ago, when longtime  
members of the support group noticed that newcomers typically were 
frustrated that they could not see what lumpectomies and 
mastectomies would do to their bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	The predicament was familiar to the group members, who likewise  
found themselves with surprisingly few sources of information about 
what they would look and feel like after treatment. One group 
member recalled hunting through the texts and sketches of medical 
journals for information. 
</P>
<P>
	``These women were saying, `Show me, show me. I need to see  
something,''' said Francoise G. Hultzapple, who underwent a radical 
mastectomy and reconstructive surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Some doctors may offer photographs showing the effects of  
surgery, but the black-and-white shots usually illustrate isolated 
torsos and fail to indicate how the whole person will look, the 
group members said. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients who have already been through a procedure often end up  
taking a newcomer aside and quietly showing the results of her 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	The photos in the book are in color against a bright blue  
background. Other sections provide brief explanations of procedures 
written by doctors or affirmations meant to help patients stay 
emotionally strong. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not want to show just a torso. We wanted women to see  
that we as a group were living beyond breast cancer,'' Hultzapple 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Each woman featured in the book offers a short account of her  
illness and surgery, often with the comments of her spouse or 
partner included. On the facing page for most of the subjects are 
four photographs taken by a Hershey Medical Center photographer: 
one in clothing selected by the woman, one in a white T-shirt and 
two with no top. 
</P>
<P>
	The book is being distributed through the women's health center  
at Hershey to support groups, hospitals, breast-care clinics, 
medical organizations and patient libraries, all of which may lend 
it to those who need to see it. The group members are hoping the 
restrictions on distribution will ensure the book is used for its 
original purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	Hultzapple said she took the book to an international conference  
on breast cancer in Canada recently and found the audience at the 
conference ``hungry'' for the book. 
</P>
<P>
	A private donation helped the support group and the medical  
center produce an initial run of 2,000 books. A second printing is 
in the works. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors can give patients a good idea of what will happen  
through drawings, pictures and a list of patients willing to talk, 
but the Hershey book looks at several procedures within one volume, 
said breast cancer surgeon Dr. Angela M. Soto Hamlin. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamlin, whose practice is near Harrisburg, was not surprised  
that women who had been through the procedures would pose for the 
book. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things I found in dealing with women with breast  
cancer is that there's a tremendous sense of being able to help 
each other,'' Hamlin said. ``They really are gifts to each other.''

</P>
<P>
	Paul Miller earned his first Emmy for directing the 1998 Tonys.  
His father, Walter C. Miller, was nominated for the Grammys. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dad, I'm sorry, and maybe next year,'' the younger Miller said  
upon accepting his award. ``I want to dedicate this to my father, 
who's celebrating his 50th year in this crazy business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a short time later, the senior Miller claimed his own Emmy,  
for best variety, music or comedy series for the ``1998 Tony 
Awards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to make one comment before I read my little list  
here. Kids have no respect -- to think that my son would take an 
Emmy away from his father. Fifty years in the business and my son 
takes an Emmy away from me. Anyhow, congratulations Paul,'' he 
said.

	The Millers joined a trio of parents and children who have both  
won Emmys. They are Danny and Marlo Thomas, James and Tyne Daly,

<HEADLINE> Bike Helmet Fit Deemed Crucial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Make sure your bike helmet fits properly --  
wearing it loose may almost double the risk of head injury in an 
accident, a researcher warns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kids and parents are not great judges of how well the helmets  
fit,'' said Dr. Frederick P. Rivara of Harborview Injury Prevention 
and Research Center, Seattle. ``Helmets that fit poorly are more 
likely to be off position on the head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rivara and his colleagues reviewed data on 1,718 helmeted bike  
riders -- adults and children -- who were brought to Seattle-area 
hospital emergency rooms after a crash. Following their release 
from the hospital, the accident victims were questioned about how 
well they thought their helmets had fit. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty-five percent reported the fit was excellent at the time of  
the crash, 28 percent reported it as good, and 6 percent reported 
it was fair or poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Those whose helmets did not have at least a good fit were 1.96  
times more likely to have suffered head injury, the scientists 
reported in the September issue of the Journal of Injury 
Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	To see what could be wrong with the fit, the researchers then  
focused on a subset of children ages 2 to 14 years. Children were 
chosen instead of adults ``because our anecdotal experience was 
that many children wear the helmets out of position, and this might 
be related to poor fit,'' the article said. However, a limitation 
of the study is that the findings on fit in children might not 
apply to adults, the researchers conceded. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the children, 98 had not suffered head injuries, despite  
having hit their head, helmet or face, but 28 others had suffered 
injury to the scalp, forehead, skull or brain. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers measured the children's heads. They also made  
plaster casts of the kids' heads, so the helmets could be placed on 
the casts as though the children were wearing the helmets. The 
scientists then compared how well the helmets fit in the two groups 
of children. 
</P>
<P>
	They discovered the problem seemed to be whether the helmet was  
too wide for the child, rather than being too long. ``The 
head-injured children had helmets that were significantly wider 
than their heads, compared with children without head injuries,'' 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Compared with the non-head-injured control group, 47 percent  
more of the head-injured children had helmets three-quarters of an 
inch or more wider than their heads, the article said. 
</P>
<P>
	The finding underscores the need for a snug fit, Rivara said.  
</P>
<P>
	The too-wide helmet is not an uncommon problem, said Randy  
Swart, director of the Bicycle Helmet Safety Institute, Arlington, 
Va. ``A lot of heads are narrower than helmets,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	People are more likely to adjust a helmet that's too loose front  
to back, because the bouncing front of the helmet is right before 
their eyes, and ``you have to adjust to keep it from bumping on 
your sunglasses,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the government pays attention to front-to-back problems,  
said Michael Lindars, manager of design and marketing for Troxel, a 
helmet manufacturer in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Product Safety Commission has a test designed to  
make sure the helmet does not roll from front to back in an 
accident, Lindars said. However, CPSC does not have a standard on 
side-to-side fit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	To create a comfortable but snug side-to-side fit, place foam  
pads, supplied with a new helmet, inside the helmet, according to 
Michael Yokota, Troxel's manager of research and development. 
</P>
<P>
	Adjusting the front-to-back fit is as simple as making sure the  
straps are tight. But many people don't know how or take the time, 
Swart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who don't know how might want to buy their helmets at a  
bike store, where trained staff can assist them in fitting it, 
Swart said. As for taking the time, ``We recommend sitting in front 
of the television and playing with your helmet until you get it 
right,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Perfect Sting Wins Garden City Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Perfect Sting benefited from a perfect trip  
under Pat Day, coming from off the pace Sunday at Belmont to win 
the $200,000 Garden City Breeders' Cup by 2 1/2 lengths over the 
French filly Nordican Inch. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first Grade I win for the 3-year-old daughter of Red  
Ransom, who was switched to the turf last year after two starts on 
dirt at the behest of owner Frank Stronach. Since then, Perfect 
Sting has won six of her nine starts on grass, with two seconds, 
and is 3-for-3 on the inner turf course at Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a tough race on paper, they came from all over,'' said  
trainer Joe Orseno, noting the international flavor of the 1 1/8-mile 
race. Among the 12 starters were a filly from Ireland and two from 
France, also including favored Ronda, winner of her last two starts 
at Newmarket in England and Chantilly in France. 
</P>
<P>
	But by the end, it was all Perfect Sting, who stayed well off  
the early pace set by Confessional, then moved up along the rail 
into contention on the far turn. At the head of the lane, Day swung 
the bay filly off the rail and she surged to the front with about 
an eighth of a mile to go, hitting the wire in 1:49.41 on the soft 
turf. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was on her game today and handled the turf great,'' Day  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The second choice of the crowd of 8,177, Perfect Sting returned  
$8.60, $5.20 and $3. Nordican Inch paid $21.80 and $9.90. Ronda, a 
neck back, paid $3 for show. 
</P>
<P>
	``She struggled a bit with the turf being soft,'' Gary Stevens,  
said of the beaten favorite. ``That surprised me, considering that 
she was coming over from Europe where the turf is generally soft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Completing the order of finish were Emanating, Confessional,  
Eze, Polaire, Nani Rose, River Fairy, Sweet Ludy, King's Mate and 
Illiquidity.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Building Village for Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq's $10 million in earthquake aid to  
Turkey will be used to build a modern village for quake victims, a 
state-run Iraqi newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey accepted Iraq's offer to build the village in the Izmit  
area, Al-Qadissiya daily reported Sunday. Part of the money will be 
used to furnish houses, it said. It did not say how many houses the 
village will include. 
</P>
<P>
	The government, under U.N. trade sanctions for invading Kuwait  
in 1990, did not have ready cash to donate after a huge quake hit 
Turkey on Aug. 17. Instead, it shipped nearly 500,000 barrels of 
oil worth $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	State-run newspapers defended the government's decision to  
donate oil to Turkey as a neighborly response to a crisis, even 
though Iraq's economy is suffering under the U.N. sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	In commentaries, the papers urged Turkey to respond to the  
overture by putting an end to flights by U.S. and British warplanes 
policing the skies over northern Iraq. The planes are based at 
Incirlik air base in southern Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Stockbrokers Accused of Bribes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Three stockbrokers face federal charges for  
allegedly pushing several stocks listed on the Nasdaq stock market 
to clients while pocketing secret payoffs from a stock promoter. 
</P>
<P>
	A 30-count superseding indictment charging four men with  
conspiracy, securities fraud and money laundering in connection 
with a fraudulent stock ``broker bribe'' scheme was unsealed 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Named in the indictment returned by a West Palm Beach federal  
grand jury Aug. 11 are stock promoter Gary Salter, 63, of Boca 
Raton; and brokers John W. Deisch, 65, of Chicago; Bruce E. 
Straughn, 43, of Wilmette, Ill.; and Robert F. Curley, 36, also of 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment followed the filing of related charges against 17  
other stockbrokers accused of taking part in the scheme. A total of 
27 people have been criminally charged in connection with the 
investigation, according to a statement released by U.S. Attorney 
Thomas Scott's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Salter carried out what authorities called a fraudulent ``pump  
and dump'' stock manipulation, by causing the artificial inflation 
of the price of certain stocks before he sold those stocks, or just 
as he sold them, according to the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	The brokers called the promoter to report client trades, getting  
price quotes that would qualify them for a 15 percent kickback, 
prosecutors said. The bribes were paid in cash by Western Union 
money transfers or through bank wire transfers, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Promoted stocks included Malvy Technology Inc., United States  
Exploration Inc., Linium Technology Inc., Madison Sports and 
Entertainment, Musicsource Inc., Entertainment &AMP; Gaming 
International Inc. and Optimax Industries Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted on all counts, Salter could be sentenced to 445  
years in prison and fined more than $21 million, while Deisch and 
Curley could be sentenced to 205 years in prison and fined as high 
as $15.8 million. Straughn could be sentenced to 105 years in 
prison and fined up to $7 million.

<HEADLINE> Frederick Law Olmsted Stamp Issued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Frederick Law Olmsted, one of the founders of  
American landscape architecture and the designer of New York's 
Central Park, was honored Sunday with a stamp from the U.S. Postal 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The 33-cent stamp was issued during the American Society of  
Landscape Architects annual meeting in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Olmsted, who lived in Brookline, designed several parks in the  
Boston area, including the ``Emerald Necklace,'' a ring of parks 
around the city. 
</P>
<P>
	The stamp is a montage that includes a John Singer Sargent  
portrait of Olmsted, a photograph of Central Park and two of his 
landscape plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Olmsted's contributions to the development of this country  
were not merely significant, but masterful,'' William Downes, 
Boston district manager for the Postal Service, said in a 
statement.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Perfecting Decaf Coffee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- The future of caffeine-free coffee is taking  
shape in petri dishes at the University of Hawaii, where scientists 
are growing plants that will produce beans without the buzz. 
</P>
<P>
	But don't expect to drink a genetically engineered double-mocha  
decaf anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
	The first plants won't be available to commercial growers before  
2003, with the first caffeine-free cups of java to be sold in 2006, 
according to John Stiles, assistant professor of plant physiology. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decaffeinated coffee you have now is treated chemically to  
remove the caffeine, and that changes the structure of the bean,'' 
Stiles said. ``In our process the bean just wouldn't have it to 
begin with. The quality will be higher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The university, in conjunction with Integrated Coffee  
Technologies, now is field-testing caffeine-free plants. 
</P>
<P>
	The first commercial crop will produce about 250,000 pounds,  
enough coffee for several million cups, said Stiles, who also is 
director of scientific research for Integrated. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee is one of Hawaii's top five crops. First introduced to  
King Kamehameha I in 1813, coffee was grown on 7,000 acres and 
generated $28.2 million in 1997, according to the state agriculture 
department. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's best known coffee is grown on the Kona side of the  
island of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	Decaffeinated coffee accounts for up to 25 percent of U.S.  
coffee sales, which reached $4 billion in 1997, according to the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawaii-based company so far has invested $750,000 in the  
project and expects to spend another $500,000 to grow the first 
plants, Stiles said. Seed money came from the state of Hawaii, with 
additional funding from venture capitalists. 
</P>
<P>
	The state university owns the patent for the bean and the  
process that created it and is leasing that to Integrated. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto Corp., in turn, is leasing to Integrated some of the  
procedures used in extracting the caffeine gene. Monsanto will 
share revenues from the sales of plants and beans and the future 
licensing of the technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Each plant will sell for up to $1.50, about three times the  
current price. 
</P>
<P>
	Integrated will market the plants to specialty growers more  
willing to absorb the higher cost and eager to offer better tasting 
coffee to customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Growers eventually will save money after the cost of  
decaffeination -- which can reach 25 percent of the cost of the 
coffee -- is factored in, Stiles said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Farmers will make back that additional cost in one or two  
years of harvest,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The project also has received interest from coffee growers  
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking with some of the major U.S. coffee roasters, but  
we have nothing definite yet,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Coffee Growers Association and Hawaii Coffee  
Growers Association said they knew nothing about the caffeine-free 
bean. 
</P>
<P>
	Maxwell House Coffee spokeswoman Mary Jane Kinkade said the  
company is monitoring the project. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for the Starbucks coffee chain said the company  
won't decide on the beans until they are grown and tasted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether this is something we would offer would depend on when  
we could test those beans,'' Helen Chung said. ``It would depend on 
the quality of the beans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The idea for a caffeine-free bean began brewing in 1991, when  
Stiles was having a beer with colleagues and was asked if there was 
a way to use biotechnology to remove caffeine from coffee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't work with coffee at the time, so I thought about it  
and said, `Yeah, this is the sort of thing you should be able to 
do,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years later, he and his team succeeded in isolating the  
protein that creates the caffeine gene. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists then isolated the gene and removed it through a  
process called anti-sense, which removes the regular coffee gene, 
turns it backwards and reinserts it, Stiles said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you stop the gene's activities so the protein can't be  
made, the caffeine can't be made,'' Stiles said. ``Some proteins 
are easy to isolate, some are hard. This one was hard. Which in a 
way is probably good for us, or else someone would have done this 
before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stiles' team is the first to successfully breed a plant without  
the caffeine gene, following failed attempts by several groups 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Grace of Qusac Decaf Inc., a Canada-based decaffeinator,  
said the company isn't worried by the threat posed by a 
caffeine-free bean, saying such a bean likely will find a niche as 
a specialty product. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may be caffeine-free, but it may also not have other  
characteristics of coffee,'' he said. ``In the end it's got to 
taste reasonable.''

<HEADLINE> Stewart Gets First Race Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Tony Stewart planned to get up early Sunday  
morning and go fishing, but as he sat chatting with the media long 
after his first victory in Winston Cup racing, he realized life 
might never be the same. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock car racing's premier rookie put on a dominant performance  
Saturday night, outrunning teammate Bobby Labonte over the final 20 
laps to become the first rookie winner in the series since Davey 
Allison in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're all special,'' the former Indy Racing League champion  
said of his victories. ``But when you win in the Winston Cup 
series, you beat the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a victory that seemed inevitable as Stewart used the  
first 24 races of the season to paint himself as a rising star and 
potential future champion. 
</P>
<P>
	But validating the obvious in Victory Lane left him both  
speechless and jubilant, and he celebrated by dousing his 
fast-arriving crew with Gatorade. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unbelievable. I would have never dreamed that I would  
have gotten here first of all, let alone gotten the opportunity to 
win,'' he said. ``To do it in my rookie season, I think it's going 
to hit even harder tomorrow morning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's Pontiac was clearly the class of the field, both on  
short runs after cautions and on long runs, when he frequently 
built up huge advantages. 
</P>
<P>
	He led 333 laps in all, including the last 144, and said it was  
even sweeter that the only car in striking distance at the end was 
that of Bobby Labonte, his teammate for owner Joe Gibbs and one of 
his mentors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The neatest thing about the whole race was the last lap,''  
Stewart said. ``I got to the middle of the backstretch and I hear 
`Hey Tony.' It was Bobby. He had changed the frequency on his radio 
to mine. I was in the middle of (turns) three and four and he said, 
`Good job.' I hadn't even won the race yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he may have been trying to trick me and he wanted me  
to lift a little early and he could drive on by,'' Stewart joked. 
``That just shows the support that this team has. I couldn't be 
more fortunate to have a teammate like Bobby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte finished 1.114 seconds behind, and was thrilled for  
Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's huge,'' he said. ``When I won at Charlotte in '95, that  
was the biggest night of my life. It just boosts your confidence 
that much more. It's great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The night also proved special for Gibbs, who surprised his  
rookie driver with a congratulatory message in Victory Lane as 
Stewart made his victory lap. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was one of the big thrills of my life,'' Gibbs said over  
the track's PA system. ``I'm so happy for Tony. He's raced his guts 
out all year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart said he was thinking about Gibbs at the end, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was thinking to myself after we took the checkered (flag),  
`If he's not here, I don't think I'm going to let him come to any 
more races this year.'''

<HEADLINE> Money Laundering Explained </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	While money laundering can take on many variations, experts say  
it always basically works in a three-step cycle: moving illicit 
money, such as drug trafficking profits, away from direct 
association with crimes; disguising the money trail; and making the 
money available to the criminals again with its illegal origins 
hidden. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks in offshore areas such as islands of the Caribbean and the  
Channel Islands off Britain, where local laws foster bank and 
corporate secrecy, often play a key role. 
</P>
<P>
	Profits from drug trafficking and other criminal activities  
often move through a series of bank accounts to make them appear as 
proceeds of legitimate business activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Several fundamental rules are at play in money laundering,  
according to the U.N. Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention, 
including: 
</P>
<P>
	--More successful money launderers imitate the patterns of  
legitimate financial transactions, the smaller the chance they will 
be caught. 
</P>
<P>
	--The more deeply embedded illegal activities are within the  
legal economy, the harder it is to detect money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	--Banks and other financial institutions with smaller proportions  
of illegal transactions and larger proportions of legal ones are 
better for hiding money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	--The higher the ratio of services to production of goods in an  
economy, the more easily money laundering can be conducted in it. 
</P>
<P>
	--Production and distribution networks for goods and services  
that are dominated by small, independent firms or self-employed 
people make it harder for authorities to distinguish between legal 
and illegal transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	--Countries with laws allowing more liberal and deregulated  
financial transactions are better for hiding criminal money flows. 
</P>
<P>
	--As financial markets become increasingly global and  
interconnected, money laundering becomes more difficult to detect.

<HEADLINE> Officials Fight Money Laundering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The rented Lear jet from Florida drops onto  
little-used air fields on Caribbean tax-haven islands. The 
passengers pop over to a shopping center full of banks and deposit 
millions of dollars in a dummy corporation's account, sometimes 
using rubber stamps of Minnie Mouse and Goofy as signatures on 
deposit cards. 
</P>
<P>
	A half-day's business can work up an appetite for a  
money-launderer. Thus the lunch that follows of grilled lobster and 
crayfish at a favorite Anguilla haunt, whose owner pulls the fare 
right then and there from the crisp northeastern Caribbean waters. 
</P>
<P>
	Money in the bank. Food in the stomach. Back to the plane, empty  
suitcases in hand. And back to the cache of cash in the United 
States -- until the next trip. Almost as quickly, the bank in 
Anguilla has spirited the money abroad, perhaps to New York or 
London, disguising the greenbacks' criminal origins. 
</P>
<P>
	It does not take an MBA to exploit the system, explains Kenneth  
Rijock, a former Miami lawyer who did two years in a federal prison 
on a money-laundering conviction. He now is a consultant to U.S. 
law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even a teen-ager could go down there, open up an anonymous  
account and set up a business,'' he said in a telephone interview. 
``The problem with the Caribbean is that we allow'' it to operate 
as a haven of criminal secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated $57 billion is laundered every year, U.S. officials  
say. Now in the news, with few details and no charges, is one of 
the biggest money-laundering operations ever in the United States: 
federal investigators believe Russian gangsters have channeled up 
to $10 billion through the Bank of New York, the 15th-largest bank 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Money laundering has evolved since the days when Rijock made his  
trips to the Caribbean and federal investigators put together the 
first anti-money-laundering strike force in ``Operation Greenback'' 
in Miami in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the free-for-all time,'' said Albert Tellechea, an  
attorney in Orlando, Fla., who was a federal prosecutor. ``People 
were walking into banks with paper bags full of cash.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a typical operation, Rijock said, he would fly from Florida  
in a rented jet owned by a World War II bomber pilot. The plane, 
destined for a Caribbean island, would carry drug trafficker 
clients and bags of cash. 
</P>
<P>
	On arrival, Rijock's party would meet with someone from a local  
``cooperating'' bank, who would help smooth the way through 
customs. 
</P>
<P>
	The ride to the bank was short. The money was counted, quickly,  
checked for counterfeits and deposited in an account in the name of 
a dummy corporation set up previously by local lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	The depositors were given signature cards, but they did not sign  
their own names. In one case, Rijock recounted, two of them used 
rubber stamps from a toy store with the images of Minnie Mouse and 
Goofy. Certificates of deposit were issued. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank immediately sent the deposited cash by courier to its  
correspondent bank in New York or London. Eventually, Rijock would 
transfer the money to big banks in Europe, Asia or Latin America, 
having successfully disguised its criminal source. 
</P>
<P>
	Lunch was next. The Barrel Stay, the eatery with the  
ocean-foraging owner on Anguilla's Sandy Ground Beach, was a 
particular favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a heavenly little place,'' Rijock said, with Belgian beer  
and dainty French pastries brought in by water taxi from nearby St. 
Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite its many variations, experts say money laundering always  
basically works in a three-step cycle: moving illicit money, such 
as drug trafficking profits, away from direct association with 
crimes; disguising the money trail; and making the money available 
to the criminals again with its illegal origins hidden. 
</P>
<P>
	Among major money-laundering operations in recent years were:  
</P>
<P>
	--The now-defunct Bank of Credit and Commerce International, a  
Third World institution that allegedly catered to arms smugglers, 
drug traffickers and terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
	--In the largest such case in the history of U.S. law  
enforcement, the undercover ``Operation Casablanca'' exposed 
Mexican bankers laundering millions of dollars for Colombian and 
Mexican drug cartels. More than 100 people were arrested, and 
millions of dollars seized, in May 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, with tighter anti-money-laundering laws, such as the  
requirement for banks to report customers' cash transactions of 
$10,000 or more to federal authorities, launderers have become more 
sophisticated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each criminal group has different needs and ways to move their  
financial assets,'' said Michael McDonald, a former senior special 
agent in the IRS' Criminal Investigation Division. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the rules have given rise to ``smurfing,'' the  
practice of breaking down transactions into smaller amounts that do 
not have to be reported. Instead of carrying bags of cash, money 
launderers sometimes use bank drafts and wire transfers. They move 
illicit profits through a series of bank accounts to make them 
appear to be legitimate business proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
	New tricks include creating dummy corporations or avoiding banks  
by using money transmitters like Western Union and storefront 
businesses that cash checks, sell money orders and traveler's 
checks and exchange foreign currency. 
</P>
<P>
	A complex new scheme called the ``black-market peso exchange  
system,'' which launders an estimated $5 billion a year in drug 
profits, involves purchases of U.S. products -- notably household 
appliances and cigarettes -- for export to Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombian peso brokers, who act as middlemen in the scheme, give  
Colombian importers IOUs in exchange for pesos. The pesos are used 
to buy U.S. dollars from drug cartels, providing the cartels with 
clean, usable currency. Then, the brokers use the dollars to buy 
the goods and smuggle them into Colombia on behalf of the 
importers, who thereby avoid high government tariffs and taxes on 
foreign currency exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very hard thing to detect,'' former prosecutor  
Tellechea said. ``On its face, it's a perfectly valid 
transaction.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Promises Broad Probe Into Waco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Angered by the Justice Department's failure to  
produce a crucial document on the Waco siege, GOP lawmakers are 
promising a broader investigation than the one planned by a special 
counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans on Sunday also stepped up pressure on Janet Reno to  
leave office, with Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott saying 
President Clinton should name a new attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton's chief of staff, John Podesta, expressed continuing  
support for Reno, declaring on CBS: ``She's a tough-minded person, 
she is going to get to the bottom of this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, former Sen. John Danforth, the Missouri Republican  
appointed by Reno to lead the independent investigation, said he 
would try to avoid a political inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of a House Government Affairs Committee, which will  
review the government's role in the 1993 Waco siege, said Danforth 
will concentrate on possible criminal activity while ``we're going 
to be taking a broader look.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to find out who's responsible,'' Rep. Dan Burton,  
R-Ind., said on ``Fox News Sunday.'' ``We don't want people in 
charge of things like Waco if they're not doing their job 
properly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth, appearing on five Sunday news programs, said his  
investigation would have a narrow focus and seek to avoid politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to be sort of a general sweeping investigation  
into whether or not good or bad judgment'' was used by government 
officials during the 51-day siege in which some 80 Branch Davidian 
followers died. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about lessons learned from Kenneth Starr's investigations  
of the Clintons, Danforth said ``this cannot be absolutely 
open-ended where one issue sort of morphs into another issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would work with Congress, but ``what I would like to  
do is to wait until the very end to issue a report and not have a 
running commentary between now and then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno last week asked Danforth to determine whether there was a  
cover-up and the government was involved in the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	The renewed criticism of the Justice Department and Reno was  
prompted by the news that an FBI report the department turned over 
to Congress years ago lacked one page that mentioned the use of 
military-style incendiary tear gas against the religious cult. 
</P>
<P>
	A department spokesman has said the key page was given to  
lawyers in criminal and civil cases involving Waco survivors, and 
the special counsel will have to look into why it never reached 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton, in a letter to Reno made public Sunday, said the  
omission of the critical page ``raises more questions about whether 
this committee was intentionally misled during the original Waco 
investigation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott has said previously that Reno should resign. On Sunday, he  
urged Clinton to take that decision out of her hands, if necessary, 
and replace her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would think the president should consult with her and move  
to a different attorney general,'' he said on CBS' ``Face the 
Nation.'' ``I believe the time has come where that would help the 
sense of justice at the Justice Department.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Reno has shown a pattern of incompetence on issues such  
as alleged Chinese theft of nuclear secrets and illegal campaign 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, who has  
suggested Reno step down because of issues other than Waco, said 
someone must be held accountable for department missteps. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's so little confidence in the administration and Justice  
Department,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno was asked Sunday by Burton to provide interviews this week  
with three Justice officials, including attorney James G. Touhey, 
Jr. Earlier this month, Touhey wrote a memo detailing his discovery 
that some copies of the 49-page FBI lab report, including the copy 
sent to Congress, did not include the last page which mentioned the 
use of military rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department insists that reports of the use of two  
flammable tear gas rounds against a storm bunker do not change the 
conclusion that the later fire that engulfed the Branch Davidians 
inside the compound was set by cult members.

<HEADLINE> Traditional Chalkboards Gather Dust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Chalk it up to changing times: The  
venerable blackboard, the center of classroom attention through 
generations of fractions and vocabulary lists, is being erased from 
the modern American classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers say they can't quite pinpoint the date when chalk -- and  
thus, chalkboards -- first began disappearing, but they invariably 
link it to the introduction of computers in classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Chalk dust mucks up circuit boards and wiring and can aggravate  
allergies and breathing problems for children with asthma, teachers 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chalk really isn't good for anything. It gets all over your  
hands and your clothes,'' said fifth-grade teacher Stephanie Tatel 
of the Amistad Academy, a newly renovated charter school in New 
Haven. 
</P>
<P>
	Architect Jay Brotman, whose firm renovated an office building  
to create the academy, said teachers recommended replacing the 
blackboards with ``white boards.'' The smooth, almost tile-like 
surface can be written on with markers and wiped clean with a 
special eraser made of a soft fabric. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the advantages, teachers say, is that bright marker colors  
better attract the eyes of children with short attention spans. 
Different assignments can be given in contrasting colors, and 
overhead projectors can display transparencies on the white boards. 
</P>
<P>
	``The markers are easier to see than yellow chalk on black,  
especially from the back rows,'' Tatel said. 
</P>
<P>
	An added bonus is that magnets stick to the marker boards, so  
teachers can post other visual aids onto them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Association of School Business Officials International, an  
alliance of about 6,000 school purchasing managers, budget 
directors and financial officers, confirms that teachers are 
overwhelmingly demanding the white marker boards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really can't remember the last time we bought a chalk  
board,'' said Deborah Grant, purchasing supervisor for St. Cloud 
Area School District No. 742 in Minnesota. She also heads the 
association's purchasing and supply management committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Clark, director of supply services for the Jefferson County  
Public School District in Louisville, Ky., said his district has 
built 15 new schools in the last 10 years. Nary a chalkboard can be 
found in any institution. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to have at least one computer in every classroom  
and the chalk dust is a problem with the new technology, not to 
mention the general cleaning in the classroom,'' Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
	The buyers say marker boards cost about the same as blackboards  
-- generally between $150 and $200 -- so it's more a question of 
teacher preference than price. 
</P>
<P>
	Brite Inc., a company in Quincy, Mass., distributes both kinds  
of boards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Marker boards are the prominent product being ordered,'' said  
company President Scott Newman. ``With all the classrooms being 
wired for the Internet, the goal is to put a computer on every 
student's desk, and the chalkboard was a dustier product.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The older boards are not being left to gather chalk dust in  
every school. For some veteran teachers, the thought of educating 
young minds without them is like the sound of nails scraping a 
blackboard. 
</P>
<P>
	``The feel of the chalk in your hand, it's a whole different  
feeling,'' said Gerald Baldino, the principal of Edgewood Magnet 
School in New Haven and an educator for 30 years. ``It's 
tradition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Principal Bonnie Pachesa said she doesn't like  
markers: they can dry up, youngsters sometimes walk off with them, 
and some markers give off an odor. 
</P>
<P>
	``They give me a headache,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Great-Granny Spy Prosecution Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A British Cabinet minister called an urgent  
meeting with the head of Britain's spy agency to determine why a 
great-grandmother, who once spied on Britain for the Soviet Union, 
was never prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
	Home Secretary Jack Straw was expected to receive a full report  
today from Stephen Lander, head of the MI5 intelligence agency, as 
Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor government came under increasing 
pressure to prosecute the 87-year-old woman. 
</P>
<P>
	News reports alleged the spy agency kept the government in the  
dark for years after finding out that Melita Norwood had been 
spying for the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Norwood, a former secretary at British Non-Ferrous Metal  
Research Association, handed over Britain's atomic secrets to the 
Soviet Union, news reports said. She began spying in 1937 and 
continued until her retirement in 1972, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many spies have been jailed for up to 40 years,'' said Anne  
Widdecombe, of the opposition Conservative Party, which led calls 
for Mrs. Norwood to face the courts. ``It seems inexplicable that a 
handful of people are going to get away with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Mrs. Norwood -- now a frail figure with wispy gray  
hair -- read a statement in her suburban London garden saying she 
had no regrets and would do it all again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did what I did, not to make money, but to help prevent the  
defeat of a new system which had at great cost given ordinary 
people food and fares which they could afford, good education and a 
health service,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her work as a spy was revealed in copies of thousands of KGB  
documents brought out of the Soviet Union by Vasili Mitrokhin, an 
archivist for the Soviet intelligence service who defected to the 
West in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents are the backbone of a book, to be published later  
this month, by Cambridge historian Christopher Andrew. Titled ``The 
Mitrokhin Archive,'' the book is being serialized by The Times of 
London. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said Monday that Mitrokhin, 77, now a British  
citizen, is living under a false name with round-the-clock 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitrokhin fears reprisal from Russia because of his treachery in  
smuggling out the documents, which may unmask further spies, The 
Times said. 
</P>
<P>
	A second Briton, former policeman John Symonds, was also  
revealed in the documents. Symonds, now 64, said the Soviets 
trained him to be a so-called ``Romeo agent'' who seduced women 
working at Western embassies into revealing secret information. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was taught how to be a better lover, or perhaps I wasn't a  
very good one before,'' he said in a British Broadcasting Corp. 
documentary, to be broadcast on Sept. 19. Excerpts were screened 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Symonds, who was wanted on corruption charges when he fled  
Britain in the 1970s, told the BBC he was recruited in Morocco and 
carried out regular undercover missions for the KGB between 1972 
and 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	News reports said he returned to Britain in 1980, gave himself  
up and served a two-year sentence on corruption charges. Symonds 
first confessed his spying in an interview with the Daily Express 
in January 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, news reports said Britain's spy agency had identified  
Mrs. Norwood shortly after Mitrokhin fled Russia, but failed to 
inform government officials until this summer. No explanation was 
given for the delay. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Mitrokhin Archive'' makes other, wide-ranging claims of  
Cold War Soviet espionage, The Sunday Times and CBS' 60 Minutes 
reported, including that the KGB planted rumors that the CIA 
assassinated President John F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper and 60 minutes also reported that booby-trapped  
explosives were hidden across the United States and Europe to 
target pipelines, railways, oil refineries and electrical stations. 
The Times, the sister paper of The Sunday Times, said records of 
the exact locations have disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	A KGB plan to disrupt the investiture of Prince Charles as the  
prince of Wales in 1969 was also disclosed. But the scheme was 
later aborted, according to The Times.

<HEADLINE> Lions Want Sanders' Signing Bonus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Detroit Lions filed a grievance with the NFL  
to get back $5.5 million of the signing bonus paid to running back 
Barry Sanders in 1997, his agent said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	David Ware said he had been negotiating with the club concerning  
the $11 million bonus Sanders got when he signed a six-year 
contract. But he said talks ended without resolution. 
</P>
<P>
	``An arbitrator will decide if the money is owed,'' Ware said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Lions star abruptly retired in August, saying he no longer  
wished to play. He needed only 1,458 yards to break Walter Payton's 
career rushing record. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lions then began talks to get back the unearned portion of  
the signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS Sports first reported the grievance Sunday. The network  
quoted Lions general manager Chuck Schmidt as saying the team would 
still welcome Sanders and ``will not consider trading his rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders has insisted he is finished playing football.

<HEADLINE> Gas Station Prices Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) -- Prices at the gas pumps jumped less  
than a penny in the past three weeks, due largely to an increase in 
crude oil prices, an industry analyst said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The national weighted average Friday, including all grades and  
taxes, was $1.3178, up from $1.31 in the previous survey Aug. 20, 
said Trilby Lundberg, who publishes the Lundberg Survey of 10,000 
gas stations nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the upward trend that marked gas prices in the summer  
may be coming to an end. 
</P>
<P>
	``With vacations ending and schools beginning, it's crude oil  
prices calling the shots at the pump,'' she said. ``If crude oil 
prices stay around the $23-a-barrel range than fuel gasoline cuts 
can be expected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The slight rise reflected a $2 increase in the price per barrel  
of crude oil to $23.55, Lundberg said. Gasoline prices were kept in 
check nationwide thanks to a four-cent-a-gallon dip in the West, 
which has started recovering from a gas shortage that hit the 
region in the spring, Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's a breakdown of the individual price per gallon for  
self-service gas: regular unleaded gas in the past three weeks cost 
$1.2653; mid-grade cost $1.3642; and premium gas cost $1.4492. 
</P>
<P>
	Full-service gas per gallon was as follows: $1.5958 for regular  
unleaded; $1.6826 for mid-grade; and $1.7552 for premium gas.

<HEADLINE> Suspect Kills Himself After Query </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) -- A 70-year-old man killed himself after  
New York police questioned him about the body of an unidentified 
pregnant woman found in an oil drum stored for decades in a house 
he once owned. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said the body of Howard Elkins was found Friday in a  
vehicle with a shotgun between his legs. 
</P>
<P>
	A day earlier, Elkins had been questioned by police from Nassau  
County in New York, where he owned a home 27 years ago. The home's 
current owner recently found the body of a woman while removing a 
rusting oil drum from a crawl space underneath the house. 
</P>
<P>
	Police determined that the drum was manufactured in 1963. Elkins  
and his wife, Ruth, owned the home from 1957 to 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were unsure whether the suicide and unsolved murder were  
related. But a Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office log entry 
confirms Elkins as ``a suspect in a 30-year homicide in Nassau 
County, N.Y.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police credit the airtight drum for preserving clues decades  
after the death of the woman, who was nine months pregnant.

<HEADLINE> Colts Remember Dead Draft Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Indianapolis Colts on Sunday remembered  
Brandon Burlsworth, the team's third-round draft pick who died in a 
traffic crash before he could take his place in their offensive 
line. 
</P>
<P>
	At halftime of the team's season-opener against Buffalo, Colts  
owners Jim and Meg Irsay presented Burlsworth's family and Arkansas 
athletic director Frank Broyles with checks for $5,000 each. One 
check will go to Burlsworth's former high school for its 
scholarship fund and the other was presented to Arkansas, his alma 
mater. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colts also announced all members of the team will have a  
special decal on their helmets in a tribute to Burlsworth. 
</P>
<P>
	Burlsworth, who began his college career as a walk-on and became  
a standout offensive lineman for the Razorbacks, was killed in a 
traffic accident April 28 while driving from the campus to his 
family's home. The accident came less than two weeks after the 
Colts selected him and shortly after he had participated in the 
team's minicamp, where coaches tabbed his as a potential starter at 
guard. 
</P>
<P>
	At Arkansas, the former Harrison High School player became a  
three-year starter and finished as an All-Southeastern Conference 
pick and a second-team All-American. He was the first pick in the 
third round, the 63rd overall selection.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Might Be Reform Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- GOP presidential contender Pat Buchanan came  
closer than ever Sunday to saying he would quit the Republican race 
and campaign for the Reform Party's nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``The door really is wide open,'' Buchanan said. ``We are very  
close to making that decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For weeks, Reform Party leader Jesse Ventura, the Minnesota  
governor, has discounted suggestions the party should nominate 
Buchanan for president. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura has said the party founded by Ross Perot is based on  
conservative economic principles, not Buchanan's social 
conservatism on abortion and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
	As recently as Friday, the Capitol Hill newspaper The Hill  
published an interview in which the governor ruled out ``a retread 
from another campaign or another party'' as the Reform Party's 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	But Buchanan, appearing on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' said his  
sister and campaign adviser, Bay Buchanan, is ``talking ... to 
people in the Reform Party'' for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are taking a hard look at leaving the Republican nomination  
run and running for the Reform Party nomination,'' Buchanan said. 
``The decision has not been made yet, ... but I tell you honestly 
we are leaning in that direction right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A telephone call to the party chairman, Jack Gargan, of Cedar  
Key, Fla., went unanswered Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan said he is being swayed by the belief that ``my party  
at the national level has become a Xerox copy basically of the 
Democratic Party. ... I think what we have is a one-party system in 
Washington that is masquerading as a two-party system, and I think 
what we need is a real opposition party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of a third-party candidacy by Buchanan is making the  
Republican front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, nervous, Time 
magazine reported in its issue on newsstands Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	It said a private poll conducted by Frank Luntz, a GOP  
consultant, showed Buchanan would win 6 percent of the vote in a 
three-way contest with Bush and Vice President Al Gore, leading for 
the Democratic nomination. Two-thirds of the Buchanan vote, the 
poll showed, would come from Bush supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush aides last week discussed ``how to make Buchanan feel  
wanted in the GOP'' and a senior Bush adviser told Time: ``We're 
surrounding him with love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Republican candidate, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said on  
CNN's ``Late Edition'' he hopes Buchanan decides to stay a 
Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	``He represents a wing of our party, in fact he represents a  
viewpoint, that I thoroughly disagree with,'' McCain said, but ``we 
need to have that debate within the party.''

<HEADLINE> Former Iowa Gov. Endorses Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Former Gov. Terry Branstad endorsed  
George W. Bush for the Republican presidential nomination Sunday 
and is becoming a Bush campaign adviser on farm issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Branstad had supported former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander,  
who withdrew from the race after a poor showing in the Iowa straw 
poll last month. 
</P>
<P>
	At a Des Moines news conference, Bush said Branstad's  
endorsement gives a significant organizational boost to his bid for 
the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``Grass-roots politics determines the outcome of the Iowa  
caucuses,'' the Texas governor said. ``Terry Branstad is a 
well-seasoned veteran of that type of grass-roots politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the news conference, Bush and Branstad went to the Clay  
County fair in northwestern Iowa to repeat the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's part of a new generation of can-do conservative governors  
who are really making a difference,'' Branstad said. 
</P>
<P>
	After Alexander dropped out of the race, the former Iowa  
governor had been under pressure to back front-runner Bush. His 
reward was the chairmanship of Bush's national agricultural 
advisory committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to help me on agricultural matters, not only during  
the Iowa caucuses, but after the Iowa caucuses,'' Bush said.

	With 16 years in office, Branstad was Iowa's longest serving  
governor when he stepped down this year. He is a respected figure 
in Republican circles but could deliver little support for 
Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
	Some strategists question his value to a campaign that's already  
an overwhelming favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	Branstad met with Bush for close to two hours last week to work  
out details of the endorsement. Branstad pointed to Bush's stand on 
education and farm issues Sunday in his announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has the empathy and the compassion to help our farmers in  
these difficult times and to restore the markets we need,'' 
Branstad said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Bush leads in most polls, he said he will focus heavily  
on the Iowa caucuses, which open the presidential nominating 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Branstad said he wants to end a losing streak for Republicans,  
who have lost Iowa to Democratic presidential candidates in the 
last three elections. ``My goal is to help George Bush not only get 
elected president but to see that Iowa is in his column,'' Branstad 
said.

<HEADLINE> Sex the Focus at Toronto Film Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- If sex really sells, then this year's Toronto  
film festival offers a veritable bounty of commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	Pornography. Incest. Nymphomania. Sadomasochism. Lesbian sex.  
Middle-aged men and college girls. Middle-aged men and high school 
girls. Couples doing it in cars and on airplanes, at home or at the 
butcher's, on the grass or in a greenhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Titles of the 320 films being shown here over 10 days include  
``Between Your Legs,'' ``Below the Belt,'' ``TOPS &AMP; Bottoms,'' 
``Split Wide Open'' ``The Virgin'' and ``Une Liaison 
Pornographique.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's obvious filmmakers are going right to the boundaries,''  
said Piers Handling, director of the Toronto International Film 
Festival, which runs through Sept. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of these movies, Handling noted Sunday, are ``festival''  
films -- releases that get shown around festivals but never receive 
commercial distribution. But several will be seen in the United 
States and elsewhere, and some will even be sponsored by Hollywood 
studios. 
</P>
<P>
	``American Beauty,'' a highly anticipated movie from DreamWorks  
SKG, stars Kevin Spacey as an unhappy suburban father who becomes 
obsessed with his teen-age daughter's best friend. His interest is 
reciprocated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Boys Don't Cry,'' a Fox Searchlight picture, dramatizes the  
true story of a Nebraska girl who passes for a boy and proceeds to 
woo (successfully, explicitly) a beautiful young woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Two releases from Miramax Films, owned by the Walt Disney Co.,  
also test the market. ``Guinevere'' stars Stephen Rea as a 
middle-aged photographer who beds women less than half his age. 
``Happy, Texas'' tells the story of two escaped convicts who are 
mistaken for a gay couple and must play along to stay out of jail. 
</P>
<P>
	A French film, Catherine Breillat's ``Romance,'' will likely be  
the most controversial commercial release. Caroline Ducey stars as 
a frustrated young woman -- her boyfriend won't sleep with her -- who 
has a number of affairs, including a sadomasochistic relationship 
with an older man. 
</P>
<P>
	``Romance'' is definitely an art-house film -- and a French  
art-house film, at that. Ducey's character spends as much time 
philosophizing about sex as actually having it. 
</P>
<P>
	But what's shown is so graphic that the film's U.S. distributor,  
Trimark Pictures, didn't even submit ``Romance'' to the Motion 
Picture Association of America, which administers the industry's 
voluntary rating system. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no argument that the film would have been rated NC-17,  
which for a lot of people connotes pornography,'' said Dennis 
O'Connor, Trimark's senior vice president for theatrical marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Romance'' will open in New York on Sept. 17 and then expand to  
several large cities in October. But the film, for reasons beyond 
the subject matter, is unlikely to be seen in smaller markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``One disadvantage of not having a rating is that it's harder to  
get some theatrical chains to show your movie,'' O'Connor said. 
``Once you try to get a movie into a suburban theater you're often 
dealing with a more conservative chain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another film coming out in the U.S. -- ``The War Zone,'' directed  
by Tim Roth -- tells the story of a British family, with two 
teen-age siblings, that implodes after the birth of the third 
child. The teen-age son discovers his father has had sex with his 
sister and then begins his own incestuous affair. 
</P>
<P>
	``The War Zone,'' to be distributed in the U.S. by the  
independent company Lot 47, will debut in New York in December and 
then open around the country. A Lot 47 executive said he never even 
considered submitting the film to the MPAA, which has been 
criticized for being too rigid about sexual content. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe in supporting a group that advocates  
censorship,'' said Jeff Lipsky, Lot 47's director of marketing and 
distribution. ``And I'm not concerned that it's going to be a 
difficult sell. If I have a passion for a film, that's all that 
matters.''

<HEADLINE> Sellout Crowd Hears Farm Aid Concert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAINESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- A sold-out crowd of 23,000 people  
listened to Willie Nelson, John Mellencamp and other performers 
Sunday at Farm Aid '99. 
</P>
<P>
	The all-day event, the latest in a series of fund-raisers for  
farmers that started in 1985, comes at a time when many East Coast 
growers are facing a severe drought. 
</P>
<P>
	Glenda Yoder, Farm Aid associate director, said there was no  
specific fund-raising goal for this year's event. ``The focus is 
very much on the awareness as well,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The concert at Nissan Pavilion was broadcast on cable's Country  
Music Television. 
</P>
<P>
	Since it began, Farm Aid has given $14.5 million to more than  
100 farm organizations, churches and service groups in 44 states. 
One recipient was the Virginia Council of Churches, which is 
distributing $20,000 to Virginia farmers hit hard by the drought. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim McDonald, the council's general minister, said the group  
already has given money to farmers from Pulaski in the southwest 
mountains to Manassas in northern Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	The variety of musicians -- including Barenaked Ladies, the Dave  
Matthews Band, Deana Carter and Farm Aid founders Nelson, 
Mellencamp and Neil Young -- drew an eclectic crowd -- aging men 
wearing cowboy hats mixed with youngsters with belly-button rings. 
</P>
<P>
	Pam Reed, 35, of Centreville said she has always donated $75 to  
$100 to Farm Aid but never had the opportunity to attend the 
concert until this year. She said farmers deserve support because 
``this is where our food comes from.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The concert about 30 miles west of Washington, D.C., will be  
followed by a rally Monday of farmers at the Capitol.

<HEADLINE> Floyd Strengthens, Nears Bahamas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Storm-weary residents in the Bahamas  
braced for a brush with Hurricane Floyd as it swelled and powered 
up to a major storm, packing winds of up to 145 mph on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	By mid-afternoon, all of the Bahamas -- a 600-mile-long line of  
islands -- was under hurricane warnings or watches. Forecasters said 
they might also issue a hurricane watch for part of eastern Florida 
Sunday night or Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	If it stays on its current path, Floyd would hit the coast of  
Florida between West Palm Beach and Cocoa Beach. Forecasters 
expected the hurricane to begin turning north before landfall, 
though perhaps not much before. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts said that by Tuesday the storm could approach the Abacos  
Islands and Eleuthera, which were blasted last month by Hurricane 
Dennis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just got back on my feet from last month's scare,'' sighed  
Marie Johnson of Nassau as she pulled out a few bills to pay for 
flashlight and radio batteries at the City Market grocery store. 
Customers streamed into the store to pick up hurricane supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. hurricane hunter airplane reported Sunday evening that  
Floyd's winds had topped the 131 mph mark of a very dangerous 
Category 4 storm. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. National Weather Service recommended people along the  
southeast coast monitor the storm's course. 
</P>
<P>
	In Florida, emergency management officials began mobilizing,  
with the state's Emergency Operations Center in Tallahassee calling 
in essential personnel for 'round-the-clock staffing. In Fort 
Pierce, officials began to analyze needs for residents who are 
disabled or need medical supervision. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Floridians took advantage of the weekend's final day to  
take careful inventory of their hurricane supplies. Osvaldo Ibarra, 
hardware manager at a Home Depot in Miami, said sales were brisk 
for batteries, nails, rope and hurricane shutter fasteners. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are really buying the extra screws, the rope, and we've  
seen a lot more generator sales,'' Ibarra said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, south of the storm's  
center, meteorologists warned that the terrain was already 
saturated, and that there could be heavy flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials posted warnings for Hurricane Floyd across the central  
Bahamas and hurricane watches throughout the northwest Bahamas. 
Tropical storm warnings were in effect for the southeast Bahamas 
and Britain's Turks and Caicos Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm swelled in size during the weekend. Hurricane-force  
winds had broadened to 115 miles from Floyd's center by Sunday. 
Tropical storm force winds extended another 175 miles, and 
forecasters said the storm would likely strengthen overnight 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	At 8 p.m. EDT, Floyd was about 370 miles east of San Salvador in  
the central Bahamas, and was headed almost due west at 14 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd's center is likely to pass close to the capital, Nassau,  
on Tuesday morning, said Arthur Rolle, deputy director of the 
Bahamas Meteorological Department. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, tourists in Nassau watched weather reports nervously.  
Honeymooners Michael and Julie Smith of Reynoldsburg, Ohio, 
lamented their bad luck. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope this doesn't mean our marriage is going to be like this  
-- messed up,'' Michael said. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents Jean and Jerry Isaacs said they had canceled plans to  
spend a few days in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could get over okay today, but by the way things are going,  
it'll be tough getting back,'' Jean Isaacs said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, Floyd was joined Sunday by Tropical Storm Gert, which  
formed midway between Africa and Barbados. Forecasters said it was 
gathering strength quickly and could become a hurricane Sunday 
night or Monday.

<HEADLINE> Frankel Will Fight Extradition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMBURG, Germany (AP) -- Martin Frankel, the American financier  
arrested in Germany on allegations that he swindled clients out of 
huge sums of money, has decided to fight his extradition to the 
United States, his lawyer said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is likely to lead to weeks of extradition proceedings  
against Frankel, who has been held in a Hamburg jail since German 
police nabbed him Sept. 4 on a tip from the FBI, ending a 
four-month international manhunt. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel rejected the option of a voluntary extradition, his  
lawyer Thomas Piplak said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Piplak said U.S. authorities now have up to two months to file  
an extradition request listing detailed charges against Frankel. 
Any decision on extradition would ultimately be decided by the 
Hamburg state court. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankel ran his empire from a heavily protected mansion in  
Connecticut and allegedly swindled clients out of at least $218 
million, possibly much more.

<HEADLINE> Falcons Extend Hall's Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Falcons agreed to a seven-year  
contract extension with defensive tackle Travis Hall for a reported 
$52.5 million, while receiver Terance Mathis and fullback Bob 
Christian also signed new contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	While Hall's deal appears much more lucrative than the  
five-year, $32 million extension for All-Pro running back Jamal 
Anderson, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that much of 
the money is backloaded in the final years of deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal-Constitution also reported that Mathis signed a $12  
million, four-year extension while Christian agreed to a new 
five-year, $10 million contract to replace the final season of his 
current deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall, 27, has been a starter on the defensive line since 1996.  
Last season, he had 73 tackles and 4 1/2 sacks despite missing two 
games with knee and ankle injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall was bothered by severe cramping during Sunday's opener, a  
17-14 loss to Minnesota in a rematch of the NFC championship game. 
He was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Christian, 30, has fully recovered from a knee injury that  
caused him to miss the final two regular-season games last season, 
as well as the playoffs and Super Bowl. He is regarded as one of 
the top blocking backs in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said if I was healthy in training camp and the knee was  
healed up good, they would sign me to an extension,'' Christian 
said. ``I give them credit. In this day and age, people don't 
always live up to their promises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mathis, 32, has caught 384 passes over the past five seasons  
with the Falcons. Last season, he had 64 receptions for 1,136 yards 
and 11 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy to be employed for four more years,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Jets' Testaverde To Miss Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- New York Jets quarterback Vinny  
Testaverde ruptured his Achilles' tendon on Sunday and will miss 
the rest of the season, a crushing blow for a team that was 
considered a Super Bowl contender. 
</P>
<P>
	Testaverde crumpled to the turf untouched after making a quick  
cut to the ball when Curtis Martin fumbled in the second quarter of 
the season-opener against New England. He immediately grabbed his 
left leg and writhed in pain. 
</P>
<P>
	The 35-year-old quarterback limped off the field, using one leg  
and two teammates for support before he stopped and had to be 
carried off. The team announced at the start of the second half 
that Testaverde will miss the rest of the season. He was taken to 
Lenox Hill Hospital in New York and was to stay overnight and 
undergo surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	New England eventually won the game 30-28 after backup  
quarterback Rick Mirer threw an interception to set up Adam 
Vinatieri's 23-yard field goal with three seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
	``They ain't going to cancel the schedule,'' linebacker Bryan  
Cox said. ``We lost one of our leaders. We lost a great player. But 
we're going to continue to play football the rest of the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Testaverde isn't the only player the Jets will have to do  
without. 
</P>
<P>
	Running back Leon Johnson tore ligaments in his knee and is out  
for the season. Other injured Jets were tight end Eric Green (neck) 
and defensive tackle Jason Ferguson (leg). 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, wide receiver Wayne Chrebet broke his foot during  
the exhibition season and is expected to miss six weeks, and 
cornerback Otis Smith is out for a month with a broken collar bone. 
</P>
<P>
	On the first play after Testaverde's injury, punter Tom Tupa,  
who's listed as the Jets' fourth-string quarterback, threw a 
perfect 25-yard touchdown pass to Keyshawn Johnson to give New York 
a 14-10 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets, who went 12-4 last season and lost to Denver in the  
AFC title game, now will have to drastically reshape their offense 
just one game into the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll feel better in a month than I do right now, but we don't  
have time for that,'' Mirer said. ``Hopefully, I can pick up right 
where Vinny left off and get this team where it deserves to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Testaverde completed 10 of 15 passes for 96 yards and a  
touchdown before he injured the tendon that connects the back of 
the heel to the calf muscles. He has thrown for 32,575 yards and 
205 touchdowns in a 13-year NFL career. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, he missed four games with a separated shoulder. He also  
missed two games with a concussion in '94. 
</P>
<P>
	Testaverde played five years with the Browns and Ravens before  
signing with the Jets as a free agent in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	In the offseason, the Jets traded backup Glenn Foley to Seattle  
for a draft pick, then signed Scott Zolak away from the Patriots. 
During training camp, the Jets cut Zolak and signed Mirer, who had 
been cut by the Green Bay Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	Tupa also played for Jets coach Bill Parcells in New England.  
Although primarily a punter in the NFL, he played quarterback at 
Ohio State and has been used by Parcells as a backup quarterback to 
add flexibility to the roster. 
</P>
<P>
	An Elmont, N.Y., native, Testaverde set University of Miami  
records for yards passing (6,058) and 48 touchdown passes while 
winning 21 of 22 games he started. He won the Heisman Trophy in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay selected him first overall in the '86 draft, and  
although he had 3,000-yard seasons in 1988 and '89, he was plagued 
by interceptions -- throwing 35 and 22 in those two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1993 season, his first with the original Cleveland Browns  
and his seventh in the league, was his first with more touchdowns 
(14) than interceptions (9).

<HEADLINE> Clinton Given Falun Gong Book </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- As China and the United States  
sought to mend recently damaged ties, President Jiang Zemin gave 
President Clinton an unusual gift: a book defending China's ban on 
a popular meditation sect. 
</P>
<P>
	During their hourlong summit Saturday, Jiang handed Clinton a  
book purporting to expose the crimes committed by Li Hongzhi, 
founder of Falun Gong, the popular group that China's communist 
government outlawed in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Titled ``Li Hongzhi and His 'Falun Gong:' Deceiving the Public  
and Ruining Lives,'' the book's 150 pages in English is a 
relentless barrage of propaganda from China's entirely state-run 
media. 
</P>
<P>
	The book contains gruesome photographs of Chinese allegedly made  
so crazy by practicing Falun Gong that they committed suicide, were 
killed or mutilated their family members. It claims 1,404 people 
have died, mostly for refusing medical treatment as instructed by 
Falun Gong teachings. Documentation and attribution are sketchy.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Thurmond Readmitted to Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., has been admitted  
to the Walter Reed Army Medical Center for tests and observation 
after complaining of feeling weak. 
</P>
<P>
	Thurmond, 96, the oldest senator ever, was admitted Saturday  
night, his press secretary, John DeCrosta, said Sunday. DeCrosta 
said doctors expected the senator to be released Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Physicians wanted to find out why he has been fatigued, DeCrosta  
said in a statement. ``Doctors will also evaluate the various 
medications Thurmond is taking and may decide that changing 
prescriptions and dosages will assist him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thurmond's last disclosed hospitalization was Aug. 22 at the  
medical center in Washington, two days after a brief stay in 
hospital in Columbia, S.C., where he had collapsed at a University 
of South Carolina reception. 
</P>
<P>
	Thurmond had surgery for an enlarged prostate during that August  
stay at Walter Reed, a procedure originally scheduled for November. 
</P>
<P>
	DeCrosta said the senator has made an estimated five previously  
unreported trips to the medical center on weekends in the last 
three months for a variety of complaints. He said none required an 
overnight stay or caused him to miss any work or Senate votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Thurmond, in a Charleston, S.C., newspaper interview, recently  
described his health as ``generally all right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not planning to die soon,'' he told The Post and Courier.  
``I expect to serve my term out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A member of the Senate since 1954, Thurmond's current term ends  
in 2002.

<HEADLINE> Photos Help Breast Cancer Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HERSHEY, Pa. (AP) -- All the women bear the scars of breast  
cancer, some slight, others extensive. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost all pose with their tops off to give a realistic picture  
of what surgery has done to their bodies. When they do, they smile 
for the camera. 
</P>
<P>
	Such are the images in ``Show Me: A Photo Collection of Breast  
Cancer Survivors' Lumpectomies, Mastectomies, Breast 
Reconstructions and Thoughts on Body Image.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the book distributed among organizations that help  
breast-cancer patients, 23 volunteers share their experiences, 
including photos of themselves, for the sake of other women who 
face life-altering decisions about breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the breast cancer support group at the Milton S.  
Hershey Medical Center and a few patients from outside the group 
conceived, wrote, edited and posed for the publication. Their goal 
was to share the kind of personal experience that can only be 
passed from one breast cancer patient to another. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't pull any punches and make this sound rosy and  
sweet,'' said Vicki Gingrich, who underwent a mastectomy in 1991. 
``But we really wanted women to understand that we're OK with 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The photographs in the book show a college adviser, an artist --  
even an assistant in the governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
	One woman advises patients to ask a lot of questions, even  
repeatedly. A second reports that her scars are fading after three 
years. A third says she opted for reconstructive surgery because 
she found it uncomfortable either to wear prostheses or to go 
without them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't hesitate to gather your family, your friends, and God  
and his angels around you'' is the advice of Nancy L. Shelly, a 
library cataloguer. 
</P>
<P>
	The book's intended readers are contending with such questions  
as whether to have a mastectomy or a less-invasive lumpectomy, or 
whether to undergo reconstructive surgery. A lumpectomy involves 
removal of a malignant lesion from the breast while preserving its 
essential anatomy, while a mastectomy requires removal of the 
entire breast and neighboring tissue. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes medical circumstances all but dictate which procedure  
doctors use. But in other situations, patients may have to balance 
issues like risk of recurrence against appearance and physical 
comfort. 
</P>
<P>
	The book had its genesis about 2 1/2 years ago, when longtime  
members of the support group noticed that newcomers typically were 
frustrated that they could not see what lumpectomies and 
mastectomies would do to their bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	The predicament was familiar to the group members, who likewise  
found themselves with surprisingly few sources of information about 
what they would look and feel like after treatment. One group 
member recalled hunting through the texts and sketches of medical 
journals for information. 
</P>
<P>
	``These women were saying, `Show me, show me. I need to see  
something,''' said Francoise G. Hultzapple, who underwent a radical 
mastectomy and reconstructive surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Some doctors may offer photographs showing the effects of  
surgery, but the black-and-white shots usually illustrate isolated 
torsos and fail to indicate how the whole person will look, the 
group members said. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients who have already been through a procedure often end up  
taking a newcomer aside and quietly showing the results of her 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	The photos in the book are in color against a bright blue  
background. Other sections provide brief explanations of procedures 
written by doctors or affirmations meant to help patients stay 
emotionally strong. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not want to show just a torso. We wanted women to see  
that we as a group were living beyond breast cancer,'' Hultzapple 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Each woman featured in the book offers a short account of her  
illness and surgery, often with the comments of her spouse or 
partner included. On the facing page for most of the subjects are 
four photographs taken by a Hershey Medical Center photographer: 
one in clothing selected by the woman, one in a white T-shirt and 
two with no top. 
</P>
<P>
	The book is being distributed through the women's health center  
at Hershey to support groups, hospitals, breast-care clinics, 
medical organizations and patient libraries, all of which may lend 
it to those who need to see it. The group members are hoping the 
restrictions on distribution will ensure the book is used for its 
original purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	Hultzapple said she took the book to an international conference  
on breast cancer in Canada recently and found the audience at the 
conference ``hungry'' for the book. 
</P>
<P>
	A private donation helped the support group and the medical  
center produce an initial run of 2,000 books. A second printing is 
in the works. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors can give patients a good idea of what will happen  
through drawings, pictures and a list of patients willing to talk, 
but the Hershey book looks at several procedures within one volume, 
said breast cancer surgeon Dr. Angela M. Soto Hamlin. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamlin, whose practice is near Harrisburg, was not surprised  
that women who had been through the procedures would pose for the 
book. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things I found in dealing with women with breast  
cancer is that there's a tremendous sense of being able to help 
each other,'' Hamlin said. ``They really are gifts to each other.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Peace in Kosovo a Slow Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOGILA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- It may not look much like a victory --  
ethnic Albanian children reciting poems about fighting for 
independence in the morning and Serbs learning about their medieval 
King Dusan in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	But to the men of Alpha Company 1/26th Infantry, this village  
school is a shining example of what they came here to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet just down the road, only Serb children attend school in  
Vrbovac, although Albanians are clamoring to get in. U.S. military 
officers decided it was too sensitive to push for multi-ethnicity 
in Vrbovac right now. 
</P>
<P>
	Such on-the-spot decisions are taken nearly every day as NATO  
and the United Nations pursue a mission without a detailed roadmap, 
unlike in Bosnia where peacekeepers are enforcing a detailed 
agreement worked out in painstaking negotiations in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	With the province divided into five sectors -- American, British,  
German, Italian and French -- the style of peacekeeping varies. Each 
area has its own unique problems depending on how many Serbs, 
Gypsies and other minorities live there. Each national command also 
has its own techniques and priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	In the American sector, the main challenge facing Lt. Mike  
Manning of Hingahm, Mass., and his platoon of Alpha Company, First 
Battalion, 26th Infantry, is how to protect the remaining Serb 
population from reprisal attacks by ethnic Albanians, who fled 
their homes during the 78-day NATO bombing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since arriving here, our mission has metamorphasized from one  
of repatriation of Albanians to one of protecting Serb enclaves,'' 
Manning says. 
</P>
<P>
	From the beginning, this has meant a round-the-clock presence at  
Serbian Orthodox churches in both ethnically mixed Mogila village 
and the Serb enclave of Vrbovac, as well as patrolling the 
surrounding area. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the start of the school year, it has also meant parking a  
Bradley fighting vehicle outside the two village schools to prevent 
any trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	On a recent school day, Sgt. Michael Caldwell of Imperial Beach,  
Calif. pulls up at the Vrbovac school at 7 a.m. A few kids are 
already gathering in the yard, waiting for the bell to announce the 
start of the school day. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldwell lines up his men and reminds them of their mission for  
the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are here to provide protection and prevent any incidents  
from happening,'' he says. The men split up, two going round the 
back of the building and two staying out front. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day, we have to take care of civilian problems as  
well,'' as protecting the school Caldwell says. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, that involves protecting the ethnic Albanian bus driver.  
</P>
<P>
	Two Serb men saunter up to the school to tell the soldiers the  
driver has been swearing at them and their families every morning 
for the past week. The soldiers promise to explain to the man that 
such behavior won't be tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
	Keeping the peace between the two sides often means making  
decisions that somebody won't like. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the hardest decisions I had to make was about a cow,''  
explains Manning. During the troops' first weeks in Mogila, a Serb 
man came to the troops, claiming that his cow was grazing in an 
ethnic Albanian's pasture. The troops approached the Albanian who 
claimed the animal was his. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because the animals are not branded here, only God knows whose  
cow that is,'' Manning said. He ruled in favor of the Albanian. The 
Serb, angry at the decision, took it to the military police, who 
decided the cow did in fact belong to the Serb. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with losing face in the town he's supposed to be  
protecting, Manning gathered the farmers, as well as Mogila's Serb 
and Albanian leaders, and explained to them he was returning the 
cow to the Albanian because the Serb had no way of proving it was 
his. 
</P>
<P>
	Such incidents reflect the larger issues plaguing the province,  
where one group of officials or soldiers will decide one thing and 
another group will push in the opposite direction. 
</P>
<P>
	Often the best results are produced by gathering all the forces  
together for a dialogue -- something which is foreign to both Serbs 
and Albanians after such a long history of ethnic hatred. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Mogila school was opened Sept. 1, U.S. Army Civil Affairs  
officers, members of the U.N. staff as well as local leaders sat 
down at three separate meetings to hammer out the details. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the discussion bogged down on which ethnic group would  
attend classes in the morning. For the past decade, Serbs have 
started the school day, with Albanians following in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the end, we went outside and flipped a coin for it,'' said  
Manning. ``Then went back inside and informed the locals how it 
would be.''

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Cash Machines Pass Y2K Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan's automatic teller machines passed  
a year 2000 computer glitch test Sunday, showing there is no need 
for Taiwanese to stockpile cash before the new year, finance 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-hour test of 256 cash machines belonging to 128 local  
and foreign banks was entirely successful, said Wang Yao-hsing, a 
Finance Ministry official. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have done is show that those outlets that most people  
use for savings, transactions and deposits will work,'' Wang told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``People should absolutely have confidence that our financial  
networks will not be affected,'' Wang said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wang personally joined in the test, withdrawing 3,000 Taiwan  
dollars in valueless certificates loaded into the machines for the 
simulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Countries around the world are rushing to reprogram or replace  
computer equipment to head off anticipated problems due to the 
rolling over of the calendar on January 1, when computers could 
read the year 2000 as 1900.

<HEADLINE> College Football Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Florida State found a way to win, and so did Penn State. That's  
the way it works with really good football teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame found a wacky way to lose for the second straight  
week, leaving the Irish all but out of the national title race with 
nary an autumn leaf on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Heroic efforts by Seminoles wide receiver Peter Warrick and  
Nittany Lions linebacker LaVar Arrington saved two of the nation's 
top teams, while a communications breakdown in the final seconds 
left the Irish in the shadow of the Purdue goal line with a 28-23 
loss to the Boilermakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick ran for one touchdown, caught a pass for another and  
finished with 167 yards as No. 1 Florida State (2-0) held off No. 
12 Georgia Tech 41-35 on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our defense has been picking up the slack for us, but the  
offense picked up the slack this time,'' Warrick said after 
catching eight passes for 142 yards and running three times for 25 
yards. He had a 17-yard TD run to open the scoring and caught a 
26-yard TD pass from Chris Weinke to put the 'Noles ahead 35-21 in 
the third quarter, 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Hamilton was exceptional in defeat for Georgia Tech (1-1).  
After being knocked out of the last two games against Florida 
State, Hamilton was 22 of 25 for 387 yards and four TDs. He 
completed his final 14 passes. 
</P>
<P>
	Arrington nearly cost his team the game, but the All-American  
blocked a field goal attempt in the final seconds and Penn State 
(3-0) escaped with a 20-17 win over rival Pittsburgh (1-1). The 
Nittany Lions fell one spot to No. 3 in this week's AP poll. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first quarter, Arrington lost his cool and was hit with  
two penalties after wrestling with Pitt's punter and another player 
who came to aid his teammate. Later, Arrington intercepted one 
pass, and after two other passes slipped through his hands late in 
the game, he rose up and swatted away Nick Lotz's 52-yard field 
goal attempt in the final seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think LaVar is playing his heart out, why pick on  
something?'' coach Joe Paterno said when asked about Arrington's 
early-game misconduct. ``He should have walked away from it. It's a 
good lesson for him. ... He almost had one of the most sensational 
days a linebacker could have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At West Lafayette, Ind., the Irish (1-2) trailed by five points  
with time running out, but Jarious Jackson moved his team to the 1. 
On third-and goal, Jackson took the snap and moved left. A 
full-house backfield of Joey Goodspeed, Tony Driver and Tony Fisher 
made running room sparse, Jackson was forced back and then tackled 
for a 9-yard loss. Time expired before the Irish could run another 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once again, we may have squandered away some opportunities,''  
Irish coach Bob Davie said a week after a 26-22 loss at Michigan 
that ended with the Irish trying and failing to get off a final 
play from the Wolverines 11. 
</P>
<P>
	For Purdue (2-0), Drew Brees threw for 317 yards and a TD and  
also ran for another score. The Irish fell to No. 24 from No. 16 in 
this week's poll, while the Boilermakers rose to No. 14 from No. 
20. 
</P>
<P>
	In another exhilarating finish, UNLV (2-0) beat Baylor 27-24 on  
the final play when Kevin Thomas returned a fumble 99 yards for a 
TD. Last week, the Bears (0-2) lost to Boston College 30-29 in 
overtime when they missed an extra point. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was one-in-a-million for something like that to happen,''  
Bears new coach Kevin Steele said. ``We got burned and I take full 
responsibility for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Hawaii (1-1) ended the nation's longest major-college  
losing streak at 19 games Saturday night with a 31-27 win over I-AA 
Eastern Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	In other Top 25 games, it was: co-No. 4 Florida 58, Central  
Florida 27; co-No. 4 Nebraska 45, California 0; No 6. Michigan 37, 
Rice 3; No. 9 Wisconsin 50, Ball State 10; No. 10 Virginia Tech 31, 
UAB 10; No. 11 Georgia 24, South Carolina 9; No. 13 Ohio State 42, 
No. 21 UCLA 20; No. 16 Kansas State 40, Temple 0; No. 18 Alabama 
37, Houston 10; No. 19 Arizona 34, Middle Tennessee 19; No. 20 
North Carolina State 38, William &AMP; Mary 9; and No. 23 Colorado 
State 38, Nevada 33.

	Also, No. 25 BYU beat Washington 35-28 on Thursday night; and  
Clemson knocked Virginia out of the Top 25 with a 33-14 upset. 
</P>
<P>
	The national title race heats up again on Saturday with two huge  
matchups -- No. 8 Miami at Penn State and No. 2 Tennessee at 
Florida. Over the years, these two matchups have had a direct 
impact on which teams play for the national title. 
</P>
<P>
	In three of the last four years, the Vols-Gators winner has  
played for the title; the Hurricanes won the last two games against 
the Nittany Lions, in 1991 and 1992, and ended up playing for the 
title each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State beat Miami 14-10 in the Fiesta Bowl to win the 1986 	
national championship. 
</P>
<P>
              *No. 1 Florida State 41, No. 12 Georgia Tech 35 	
</P>
<P>
	At Tallahassee, Fla., Tech stayed with the Seminoles all night,  
although they never led. Hamilton threw a 22-yard TD pass to Kelly 
Campbell with 1:35 left, but an onside kick was fielded by FSU's 
Travis Minor and the Seminoles ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Weinke threw for 262 yards and three TDs in a game that 	
saw the teams produce TDs on seven consecutive possessions -- five 
in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
                   *No. 3 Penn State 20, Pittsburgh 17 	
</P>
<P>
	At State College, Pa., Travis Forney's 24-yard field goal with  
1:20 left were the winning points as the 34-point underdog Panthers 
gave the Nittany Lions all they could handle. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew a game like this would come for us because things have 	
come so easy for us,'' Paterno said. ``You've got to be able to win 
a game like this if you've got aspirations.'' 
</P>
<P>
                *co-No. 4 Florida 58, Central Florida 27 	
</P>
<P>
	At Gainesville, Fla., the Gators (2-0) have completed their  
warmups and are ready to talk Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, we went up there and gave them that game,'' Gators  
receiver Darrell Jackson said of the Vols' 20-17 OT win in 
Knoxville. ``Now, they think they have better athletes than us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They might, especially on defense. The Gators have allowed 784  
yards passing in their first two wins, but neither game was ever in 
doubt. 
</P>
<P>
                  *co-No. 4 Nebraska 45, California 0    	
</P>
<P>
	At Lincoln, Neb., two quarterbacks are better than one for the  
Huskers (2-0), especially when both are playing at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	Backup Eric Crouch became the first Husker since Johnny Rodgers  
in 1973 to run, throw and catch a pass for a TD in an easy win over 
the Bears (1-1). In all, he had four TDs. 
</P>
<P>
	Starter Bobby Newcombe threw a TD pass to Crouch and ran for  
another in the rout. Cal was held to 145 total yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Also:  
</P>
<P>
	At Ann Arbor, Mich., Drew Henson, alternating with starter Tom  
Brady, ran for one TD and threw for another in Michigan's 37-3 win 
over Rice. ... At Madison, Wis., Ron Dayne ran for 158 yards and a 
TD in Wisconsin's 50-10 rout of Ball State (0-2). ... With QB 
Michael Vick out with an injury, Virginia Tech's defense came 
through, setting a school record by allowing just 63 yards in a 
31-10 win over UAB (0-2). Tech is 2-0. ... South Carolina (0-2) 
scored its first points under coach Lou Holtz, but Quincy Carter 
threw for 251 yards and a TD as Georgia (2-0) won 24-9 at Athens, 
Ga. ... Steve Bellisari, in relief of Austin Moherman, threw two TD 
passes to Ken-Yon Rambo and rallied Ohio State (1-1) over UCLA 
(1-1) 42-20 at Columbus. The Bruins were missing nine starters and 
four backups who were suspended for illegally obtaining and using 
handicapped-parking placards. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Murphy, back after breaking his right foot last month, ran  
for 149 yards and two TDs as Kansas State opened its season with a 
40-0 win over Temple (0-2) at Manhattan, Kan. ... Clemson coach 
Tommy Bowden go his first win as Brandon Streeter threw for a 
school-record 343 yards and two TDs in a 33-14 upset of Virginia 
(1-1) at Death Valley. ... NC State (3-0) warmed up for next 
Saturday's game at Florida State with a 38-9 win over William &AMP; 
Mary. The Wolfpack upset the Seminoles 24-7 last season.

<HEADLINE> Testaverde, Other Key Players Hurt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Vinny Testaverde, who led the New York Jets to the AFC  
championship game last season, won't have a chance to do it again 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Testaverde ruptured his Achilles' tendon in the Jets' 30-28 loss  
to New England on Sunday and will miss the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't alone. Several key players around the league were hurt  
in the season-openers, including Heisman Trophy winner Ricky 
Williams of New Orleans, Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre, Detroit 
receiver Herman Moore and Buffalo running back Thurman Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	But none of the injuries was as bad as Testaverde's.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel terrible for Vinny,'' Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe  
said. ``Vinny's a guy that's been through a ton of hard times and 
been on some terrible football teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``Finally, last year, he gets a chance to play on a good team  
and does extremely well. This year it looks like he's going to be 
very strong again and all of a sudden he's out for the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Testaverde crumpled to the turf untouched after making a quick  
cut to the ball when Curtis Martin fumbled in the second quarter. 
He immediately grabbed his left leg and writhed in pain. 
</P>
<P>
	The 35-year-old quarterback limped off the field, using one leg  
and two teammates for support before he stopped and had to be 
carried off. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets, already missing wide receiver Wayne Chrebet and  
cornerback Otis Smith with preseason injuries, also lost running 
back Leon Johnson for the season with torn knee ligaments. Other 
injured Jets were tight end Eric Green (neck) and defensive tackle 
Jason Ferguson (leg). 
</P>
<P>
	``They ain't going to cancel the schedule,'' linebacker Bryan  
Cox said. ``We lost one of our leaders. We lost a great player. But 
we're going to continue to play football the rest of the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In New Orleans, Williams gained 40 yards on 10 carries in the  
Saints' 19-10 win over Carolina, but reinjured the left ankle that 
hampered him in the preseason. 
</P>
<P>
	After a first-quarter run, Williams got up limping and hopped to  
the sideline. He returned for two more carries in the second 
quarter before being taken to the locker room, and he didn't play 
in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't that painful. I wanted to go back in, but they said  
no,'' said Williams, who sprained his ankle in a slightly different 
location than the original injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore sprained his left knee in the opening quarter in Seattle,  
ending his streak of catching a pass in 107 straight games. He is 
expected to be out about four weeks. Moore's reception streak tied 
him for 10th longest in NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
	Favre hurt his throwing hand in a collision with Russell  
Maryland's helmet in the third quarter against Oakland, but still 
managed to lead the Packers to a 28-24 comeback victory. The 
Packers said X-rays showed no broken bones in the hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas injured his ribs on the first play against Indianapolis  
and was finished for the day. X-rays were negative. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle received a scare when its Pro Bowl outside linebacker,  
Chad Brown, had to leave the field in an ambulance with a neck 
injury. Brown, hurt on a run by Lions fullback Cory Schlesinger, 
was taken to a hospital for X-rays, and the Seahawks said all 
neurological signs were positive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Chad is OK,'' coach Mike Holmgren said.  
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Ogden, a Pro Bowl offensive tackle for Baltimore,  
injured his hip early in the second quarter against St. Louis and 
didn't return. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta quarterback Chris Chandler strained his right hamstring  
in the fourth quarter against Minnesota and hobbled off the field. 
His status was uncertain for next Monday night's game at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco's Lawrence Phillips gained just 8 yards against  
Jacksonville before leaving with a concussion.

<HEADLINE>  German Gov't Cheers Move to Berlin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- The government on Sunday gave Berliners a chance  
to peek behind the scenes of one of the world's largest 
construction projects as Germany continued the massive process of 
moving its government back to its historic capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder apologized for the disturbance all  
the work is causing in Berlin, where the skyline is obscured by 
cranes, and the din of jackhammers often fills the air. 
</P>
<P>
	But politicians and civil servants intend to feel at home, he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to be guests in Berlin, we want to be a part of  
Berlin,'' Schroeder said at a breakfast outside his temporary 
quarters, the former home of East Germany's communist leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder put words into action Sunday, serving coffee to  
breakfast guests as other Cabinet ministers handed out huge 
weisswursts, or white sausages. 
</P>
<P>
	The government completed its 300-mile move from Bonn over the  
summer and is now governing from Berlin for the first time since 
the Nazi era. Germany's parliament, the Bundestag, held its first 
session in the restored Reichstag last week, and Schroeder began 
his work in Berlin last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Politicians have hailed the move as a way to bring together  
Germany's west and formerly communist east, causing the government 
to confront firsthand the culture clash evident in once-divided 
Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	For one of the men who packed the politicians' belongings, the  
move itself was a sign that the nation is growing together. 
</P>
<P>
	``We worked together with colleagues from east and west,'' said  
Michael Eichorn, who sat next to Schroeder at the breakfast Sunday. 
Among Eichorn's packing jobs: making sure the parliament's 7,500 
bottles of wine made the trek in one piece. 
</P>
<P>
	Many government ministries have yet to actually move in to their  
new quarters -- which range from futuristic, sleek structures to the 
harsh, vertical lines of old Nazi buildings that are getting 
facelifts. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the weekend, those lucky enough to get one of the free  
tickets for the public could tour the government buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Finance Ministry, housed in the former Nazi air force  
building, visitors peeked at the piggy banks lining Finance 
Minister Hans Eichel's desk. Those who toured the Chancellor's 
temporary quarters saw Schroeder's office -- complete with two 
pictures of his wife, Doris. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Foreign Ministry, visitors got a chance to see the work  
in progress on a new wing being built in front of the former Nazi 
central bank, the Reichsbank. A stark contrast to the imposing, 
boxy structure behind, the huge, glass-enclosed atrium will be open 
to the public and house a cafe and library as well as offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Glass, representing the transparency of German democracy, is  
prevalent in the new buildings. The crowning element of the 
Reichstag's reconstruction is a gleaming dome that allows visitors 
to look down on the chamber where parliament meets. 
</P>
<P>
	The weekend open house also helped reinforce the German  
democratic tradition of the last 50 years, Berlin Mayor Eberhard 
Diepgen said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This demonstrates the openness of our democracy,'' he said.

 *Momcilo Djujic    	
</P>
<P>
	SAN MARCOS, California (AP) -- Momcilo Djujic, a political emigre  
and one of the top leaders of World War II anti-Nazi, 
anti-communist Serbian troops known as Chetniks, died Saturday, a 
longtime friend said Sunday. He was 92. 
</P>
<P>
	Djujic became a wartime Serb leader when Nazis invaded the  
former Yugoslavia in 1941. He led his units in what is today 
central and southern Croatia where he fought against the Germans, 
local pro-Nazi Croats and also against the communist-led local 
guerrillas support by Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1945, Djujic was wanted by the triumphant communist  
guerrillas led by Josip Broz Tito, but managed to escape to the 
United States. Under Tito's 35-year rule, Djujic was banned from 
returning to the country and the U.S. government consistently 
rejected extradition claims from Belgrade, which sought him as 
alleged war criminal. 
</P>
<P>
	In Chicago, Djujic was a prominent activist of the Serb  
anti-communist emigres and later moved to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	Djujic advocated restarting the monarchy in Yugoslavia and  
abolishing the communist regime established after the war. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in 1907, Djujic's original training was as a priest. He  
attended a Serb Orthodox seminary in northern Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	At the outset of the war, he became a leader of the Serb  
Chetniks. His followers were mostly ethnic Serbs in Croatia who 
were fleeing prosecution and death camps run by members of the 
Ustashas regime, the World War II-era Nazi puppet regime of Croat 
nationalists. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike many other World War II Chetniks executed by Tito's  
troops after the war, Djujic fled to Italy and later to Chicago. In 
1948 he founded the Ravna Gora movement that gathered Serb emigres, 
mostly political exiles. Tito's government declared him a war 
criminal in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
	He also edited the publication ``Srbija'' (Serbia) by emigres in  
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	After Croatia seceded from Yugoslavia in 1991 and tried to  
reestablish Ustashas, it demanded Djujic's extradition for alleged 
war crimes against Croats.

 *Mohammed Ali Fahmy    	
</P>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Field Marshall Mohammed Ali Fahmy, Egypt's  
former army chief of staff and commander of Air Defense Forces 
during the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, died of kidney failure Sunday in 
London. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
	Fahmy, a graduate of Soviet military academies, served as a  
close adviser to former presidents Gamal Abdel-Nasser and Anwar 
Sadat. His command of the air defense forces during the 1973 Middle 
East War -- when he set up what came to be known as an 
``impenetrable wall'' against Israeli warplanes -- brought him fame. 
</P>
<P>
	During the war, Fahmy developed a close friendship with  
President Hosni Mubarak, who was the commander of Egypt's air force 
at the time. After Mubarak took office in 1981, he made Fahmy army 
chief of staff and later his military adviser.

 *Otto A. Silha    	
</P>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Otto A. Silha, a former publisher and  
president of the Minneapolis Star and Tribune and a champion of 
media ethics, died Saturday of a heart attack. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Silha, a Chicago native, began his career in 1940 as a copy  
editor at the former Minneapolis Star. He spent 40 years with the 
Minneapolis Star and Tribune and Cowles Media Co., leaving for four 
years during World War II when he served in Air Force intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	He later became chief executive officer and chairman of the  
board of Cowles Media, the former owner of the Star Tribune, as the 
newspaper is now called. 
</P>
<P>
	Silha was a member of the board of directors of The Associated  
Press from 1978 to 1984, when he retired from publishing. 
</P>
<P>
	The University of Minnesota, his alma mater, announced in 1984  
it would establish the Silha Center for the Study of Media Ethics 
and Law within the university's School of Journalism and Mass 
Communication. 
</P>
<P>
	Silha gave about a half million dollars to help establish the  
center and contributed $1 million to the center this year. He also 
gave $1 million to establish a professorship in media ethics and 
law and made smaller gifts on a regular basis, Babcock said. 
</P>
<P>
	After he retired, Silha formed Silha Associates, a national  
media and management consulting organization. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of his death, Silha was chairman and president of  
CITY INNOVATION, a Minneapolis-based national volunteer program he 
founded. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, Helen; sons Stephen and Mark Silha;  
a daughter, Alice Reimann; and three grandchildren.

	International Peacekeepers To Aid E. Timor  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Under intense international pressure,  
Indonesia announced today it would allow an outside peacekeeping 
force to restore order to the devastated territory of East Timor. 
President Clinton, in New Zealand for a meeting of Asia-Pacific 
leaders, said the peacekeeping mission would require ``some 
presence on the ground'' by U.S. forces. The crisis, in which 
hundreds have been killed in rampages by pro-Indonesian militias 
and Indonesian troops, began Aug. 30 after East Timor voted to 
become independent from Indonesia.

	IMF Finds Signs of Global Recovery  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The global economy finally is showing signs of  
an upturn after struggling for more than two years with a virulent 
financial crisis, the International Monetary Fund said today. The 
182-nation lending organization said in its annual report that 
threats of economic troubles spreading have lessened considerably 
since last fall, when the collapse of the Russian ruble was felt 
around the world.

	Palestinians Demand Final Deal Within Year  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- On the eve of the resumption of final peace  
talks, Palestinian officials said today they were surprised by 
suggestions that Israel may forego a final peace deal, and said 
Palestinians would unilaterally declare a state if Israel reneges 
on its obligations. Entering the negotiations, the two sides 
expressed different expectations. The Palestinians said a final 
peace deal must be reached within a year, while Israeli Prime 
Minister Ehud Barak said that the parties may conclude after a year 
that a deal cannot be reached and drop their efforts altogether.

<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Hurricane Floyd, which has residents in  
the Bahamas braced for the worst, could hit the coast of eastern 
Florida tonight or Monday. A U.S. hurricane hunter airplane 
reported Sunday evening that Floyd's winds had topped 140 mph, 
making it a very dangerous Category 4 storm. The U.S. National 
Weather Service recommended people along the southeast coast 
monitor the storm's course.

</P>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- U.S. and North Korean negotiators ended six days  
of meetings in Berlin on the communist nation's missile program 
today with a pledge to keep talking, but without an agreement. The 
United States hopes to persuade North Korea to freeze its missile 
programs, seen as a threat to East Asia's military balance, in 
exchange for food aid and an easing of economic sanctions. Western 
military analysts believe North Korea plans to test an advanced 
model of a long-range missile it fired over Japan a year ago.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Angered by the Justice Department's failure to  
produce a crucial document, GOP lawmakers are promising a broader 
investigation into the 1993 Waco siege than the one planned by a 
special counsel. For his part, former Sen. John Danforth, the

Monica Lewinsky scandal and the president's other controversies. 
``He is probably in a stronger position in the seventh year of any 
president that I can remember,'' Gore said of President Clinton in

last year and implemented their strict interpretation of the Koran.

	Fourth Death Probed in NY Outbreak  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A fourth death is being investigated in an  
outbreak of mosquito-borne encephalitis that had workers spraying 
insecticide across the city today, including in Central Park. A 
79-year-old woman who died Saturday was among 10 new suspected 
cases of St. Louis encephalitis, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said 
Sunday.

	Agassi Captures U.S. Open Title  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Andre Agassi never lost his serve or his nerve,  
even when Todd Martin seemed to have him beat, as he capped one of 
the greatest summers in tennis history by capturing his second U.S. 
Open. Agassi came up with his most spectacular shots -- none better 
than a lunging return from the court that broke Martin's serve and 
spirit -- in a dominating fifth set to win 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 6-7 
(2-7), 6-3, 6-2.

	23 Die in Moscow Explosion  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- An explosion destroyed an apartment building  
before dawn Monday in Moscow, killing at least 23 people and 
leaving scores of other residents missing. The blast wrecked an 
eight-story apartment building in southern Moscow just four days 
after an explosion shattered a similar building elsewhere in the 
Russian capital. The blasts were about four miles apart. Police 
said at least 23 people, including a child, were killed in the 
explosion, which leveled the building. Five people were injured, 
they said.

	Israel, Palestinians To Open Talks  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Six years to the day after the historic White  
House handshake between Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat, Israelis 
and Palestinians are getting down to the real business at hand -- 
defining permanent borders. After two false starts in May 1996 and 
November 1998, talks on a final peace accord are being launched 
this evening with a festive ceremony at the Erez Crossing between 
Israel and the Gaza Strip. The negotiators -- Arafat's deputy, 
Mahmoud Abbas, and Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy -- face a 
daunting task.

	GOP Promises Broad Probe Into Waco  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New special counsel John Danforth and  
congressional Republicans are defining their turf in coming Waco 
investigations, with Danforth saying he'll keep narrowly focused on 
cover-ups and lawmakers promising broader, more political 
inquiries. Danforth, a former Republican senator from Missouri, 
said Sunday that he was interested in whether there was a cover-up 
of facts about the 1993 siege of the Branch Davidian compound near 
Waco, Texas, and whether government officials, contrary to their 
claims, shot at members of the religious cult.

	Indonesia Agrees on Outside Peacekeeping Force  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- President B.J. Habibie announced  
Sunday that Indonesia would allow an outside peacekeeping force to 
restore order in East Timor, where hundreds of thousands of people 
have been chased from their homes by pro-Indonesia forces since the 
former Portuguese colony voted for independence on Aug. 30. 
President Clinton, in New Zealand for a meeting of Asia-Pacific 
leaders, said the peacekeeping mission would require ``some 
presence on the ground'' by U.S. forces.

	U.S., N. Korea Negotiate Tentative Deal  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In what appeared to be a step toward  
neutralizing a potential nuclear threat, the United States and 
North Korea negotiated a tentative deal that officials said Sunday 
offers assurances the communist nation won't test long-range 
missiles. A senior U.S. official called the agreement ``a step 
forward in our effort'' with the insular North Korean regime whose 
missile program has raised concerns in the United States and among 
U.S. friends in Asia. The United States has been grappling with 
North Korea for years in an attempt to sidetrack nuclear weapons 
programs that, if nothing else, raise tensions on the Korean 
Peninsula.

	Hurricane Floyd Threatens Bahamas, Fla.  
</P>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Storm-weary residents in the Bahamas  
braced for a brush with Hurricane Floyd as it swelled and powered 
up to a major storm, packing winds of up to 145 mph on Sunday. All 
of the Bahamas -- a 600-mile-long line of islands -- was under 
hurricane warnings or watches. Forecasters said they might also 
issue a hurricane watch for part of Florida's east coast Monday. A 
U.S. hurricane hunter airplane reported Sunday evening that Floyd's 
winds had topped the 131 mph mark of a very dangerous Category 4 
storm. At 11 p.m. EDT, Floyd was centered about 330 miles east of 
San Salvador in the central Bahamas, and was moving west at near 14 
mph.

	'Ally McBeal,' 'Practice' Top Emmy Awards  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In a double coup for creator David E. Kelley,  
the quirky ``Ally McBeal'' won the Emmy for best comedy Sunday 
night and his courtroom drama, ``The Practice,'' won for best drama 
series. The Fox comedy about a bizarre Boston law firm toppled 
NBC's ``Frasier,'' which had won the best comedy award five years 
in a row. Helen Hunt won her fourth straight best comedy actress 
Emmy for the sentimental finale of ``Mad About You'' and John 
Lithgow was honored as top comedy actor for ``3rd Rock From the 
Sun.''

	White Sox 4, Indians 3  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Magglio Ordonez hit a solo home run to lead the  
Chicago White Sox to a 4-3 victory Sunday over the Cleveland 
Indians and snap a six-game losing streak. The AL Central Division 
champion Indians, who started a lineup minus regulars Manny 
Ramirez, Roberto Alomar, Omar Vizquel, David Justice and Harold 
Baines, lost for just the fourth time in their last 13 games. Mike 
Sirotka ended a three-game losing streak with the win, and won his 
first game in three starts this season against the Indians.

<HEADLINE> Returning Puerto Ricans Bewildered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Elizam Escobar searched deeply into  
his past as he greeted friends and relatives whose faces had aged 
and voices had changed during the nearly two decades he'd been away 
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you remember me?'' asked a man who hugged Escobar in his  
first hours of freedom Saturday in his homeland of Puerto Rico. 
There was a glint of recognition, then an avalanche of memories, as 
Escobar, a graphic artist from New York, gave his friend a bear hug 
at his mother's house. 
</P>
<P>
	Joy and bewilderment filled Escobar and six other Puerto Rican  
nationalists who came home to this Caribbean island over the 
weekend. They were among 14 who had accepted a controversial 
clemency offer from President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	All had been imprisoned on sedition and weapons convictions  
stemming from their involvement in the Armed Forces of National 
Liberation, a pro-independence group blamed for 130 bombings in the 
United States that killed six people and wounded dozens of others 
from 1974 to 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first public expression of remorse from one of the freed  
prisoners, Ricardo Jimenez, who arrived in San Juan Sunday night, 
said on NBC's Meet the Press that he regretted the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	``In anything that has happened, the precaution that we've  
always taken is the preservation of human life -- you know, we're 
deeply sorry that other things have happened contrary to that,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the other prisoners, Jimenez was welcomed at the airport  
Sunday night by a crowd of jubilant independence supporters. 
``Freedom! Freedom!'' they shouted as Jimenez raised a Puerto Rican 
flag in salute. 
</P>
<P>
	As they returned home to a flurry of hugs and home-cooked meals,  
the former prisoners were able to forget, for the moment, the 
political firestorm surrounding their case. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the criticism continued unabated on the mainland.  
</P>
<P>
	Republican presidential contender Steve Forbes said Saturday  
that the releases amounted to a ``terrorists-for-votes deal'' to 
help Clinton's wife, Hillary, in her possible campaign to win a 
U.S. Senate seat from New York. He challenged Vice President Al 
Gore, also a presidential contender, to say where he stands on the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	In the middle-class suburb of Bayamon, Escobar tugged at the  
cheek of 1 1/2-year-old Anel Rios, brought to him by his cousin Elizam 
Rios. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's never seen him. I've never seen him,'' said Rios, who  
was five when Escobar was imprisoned. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives and friends crowded into the sweltering house, where a  
1991 poster honoring Escobar and his paintings hung on a wall. 
Curious neighbors watched the gentle celebration from their porch 
across the street. 
</P>
<P>
	``So much time. So much time. But here we are,'' a beaming  
friend said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the kitchen, relatives prepared the national dish of rice and  
beans, mashed plantains, oven-baked bread, fish and salad. 
</P>
<P>
	The festivities lasted into Sunday, the anniversary of two  
important nationalist events. It was the birthday of Pedro Albizu 
Campos, the founder of Puerto Rico's independence movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday was also the anniversary of the 1983 robbery of a Wells  
Fargo truck in which militants of Puerto Rico's Macheteros guerilla 
group stole $7.1 million that officials said was to fund terrorist 
attacks against the United States. Three of those convicted in that 
robbery were forgiven outstanding fines under Clinton's clemency. 
</P>
<P>
	A reflective Escobar -- thinner than in a portrait displayed on a  
table -- took it all in stride, watching a television report on the 
freed prisoners' return to Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	Escobar said that he and the other prisoners were going to  
continue struggling for independence. Escobar also wants to expel 
the U.S. Navy from the outlying island of Vieques, where the Navy 
maintains a live-fire bombing range within miles of some 10,000 
inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
	Another freed activist, Adolfo Matos, showed little remorse and  
expressed adamant support for Puerto Rico's independence in a phone 
conversation recorded by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons last April, 
Newsweek reported in its upcoming issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the justice of my people ... my desire has gotten  
stronger,'' Matos said in the conversation, Newsweek said. 
</P>
<P>
	Escobar said parole conditions prohibiting him from associating  
with fellow convicts ``are more proof of our colonial condition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A former art teacher at New York's Museo del Barrio, Escobar  
said he planned to promote Puerto Rican art and culture as a way to 
defend the island's nationality and champion its independence. 
</P>
<P>
	He was undeterred by the minuscule support that cause has in  
Puerto Rico, a territory that has grown relatively rich under 101 
years of U.S. rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Escobar said he did not know that he would be permitted to live  
in Puerto Rico until he was walking out of El Reno prison in 
Oklahoma on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This transition is going to take a lot of time,'' a somewhat  
weary Escobar admitted. ``I feel a great happiness ... but this is 
a very different reality.''

<HEADLINE> Emmys Build on Oscars Fashion Trend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A sea of stars wearing metallic colors, beads  
and sequins made the red carpet sparkle at Sunday's Emmys. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennifer Aniston of ``Friends'' wore a beaded Randolph Duke gown  
in bronze, Christine Lahti of ``Chicago Hope'' chose a shimmery 
silver long-sleeve gown by Badgley Mischka and Tracey Ullman looked 
glamorous in a magenta beaded Chanel knee-length dress. 
</P>
<P>
	The shimmering, bright looks built on the trend set at last  
spring's Academy Awards, when an explosion of color highlighted by 
Gwyneth Paltrow's pink Ralph Lauren gown trashed the award-show 
tradition of elegant black. 
</P>
<P>
	While the fashion world flocked to New York this weekend for  
Women's Fashion Week, all eyes were on the Emmys for signs of the 
next trend. 
</P>
<P>
	If Oscar night is ``the world's largest fashion show as they say  
it is -- and I suspect they're right -- the Emmys is No. 2,'' said 
New York-based fashion columnist Marylou Luther. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the entertainment world, this is a key publicity, fashion  
and wardrobe event. Just look at the media newspaper and magazine 
coverage,'' said Tom Julian, trend analyst for Fallon McElligott 
Advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	``The timing of the Emmys is perfect,'' Julian said. ``It's a  
jump-start for the fall fashion season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gena Lee Nolin wore a navy beaded dress by Pamela Dennis that  
left nothing to the imagination. ``I saw this and couldn't help 
myself. It's so glamorous,'' said Nolin of ``Baywatch'' fame.. 
</P>
<P>
	Laura Innes of ``ER'' and Edie Falco of ``The Sopranos'' also  
wore Dennis' designs. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis, who provided fashion commentary for ``Entertainment  
Tonight,'' said: ``It's amazing to see everyone in my dresses. I 
get chills all over. It's why I do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Cardona fashioned an eye-popping, lavender chiffon gown  
with ``strategically located sequins'' for Lara Flynn Boyle of 
``The Practice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cardona said Boyle brought him a photograph of Marilyn Monroe  
singing ``Happy Birthday'' to John F. Kennedy for inspiration. 
``She said she wanted a `Happy Birthday, Mr. President' dress for 
2000,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Felicity'' star Keri Russell's choice for the Emmys was a pale  
gray strapless silk gown by Giorgio Armani. Jodie Foster, wearing a 
pale pink beaded gown with spaghetti straps and a fishtail train by 
Armani, said it was the first and only dress she tried on. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke not only dressed Aniston (who was accompanied by Brad Pitt)  
but also provided gowns for Debra Messing of ``Will and Grace,'' 
Patricia Heaton of ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' Kristen Johnston of 
``3rd Rock From the Sun,'' Jane Leeves of ``Frasier'' and Lorraine 
Bracco of ``The Sopranos.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for the jewels that added to the sparkle, Harry Winston said  
it was providing them to more than a dozen celebrities, including 
Calista Flockhart and Lucy Liu of ``Ally McBeal.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Beach Volleyball Impresses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- It was almost a perfect afternoon for the three  
U.S. beach volleyball teams in the medal round of the U.S. Olympic 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Rob Heidger and Kevin Wong won their first beach tournament,  
beating the Spain's Javier Bosma-Fabio Diez 15-10 on Sunday to 
claim the men's gold medal before a crowd of 2,000 on Mission Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Reno and Linda Hanley settled a score from the Atlanta  
Olympics by upsetting Australia's Natalie Cook-Kerri Pottharst 
15-13 for the women's bronze. 
</P>
<P>
	But reality spiked the top U.S. women's team of Jenny Johnson  
Jordan-Annett Buckner Davis, who put up a strong challenge only to 
lose the gold medal match 15-12 to the world's top-ranked team of 
Adriana Behar and Shelda Bede of Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Johnson Jordan-Buckner Davis represent the best hopes for  
a U.S. women's medal at the Sydney Games, which start a year from 
this week. The American women were shut out at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Olympic Cup, a mini-preview of the Sydney Games, was to  
conclude Sunday night with the women's basketball gold medal game 
between the United States and Australia, and 16 swimming medals 
were to be decided. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Sunday afternoon, Stacey Nuveman hit a three-run homer and  
Christa Williams pitched the USA's fourth straight complete game as 
the Americans beat Australia 5-0 for the softball gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	In their first full season together on the women's international  
beach tour, Johnson Jordan-Buckner Davis were the most consistent 
U.S. team with four medal finishes in six tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been amazing to see our progress,'' said Johnson Jordan,  
the daughter of 1960 Olympic decathlon gold medalist Rafer Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've come from pretty much not knowing this sport at all a  
year and a half ago to being one of the top teams,'' said Buckner 
Davis, whose father, Cleveland Buckner, played in the NBA. ``But in 
order to be the best, we have to be consistent, every single play. 
Just a few less errors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson Jordan-Buckner Davis are now 0-5 against the Brazilians,  
with four of the losses coming this year. Sunday's match was the 
second-closest in the series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just about every time we play them, I think we have a better  
match, definitely,'' Buckner Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson Jordan-Buckner Davis led 8-6, but the Brazilians scored  
the next six points. The closest the Americans got was 14-12. On 
game point, Jordan Johnson's return landed out of bounds and she 
sprawled on her back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we turned it around ourselves by making some errors,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the biggest obstacles they'll face in the next year is  
high expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said Johnson Jordan-Buckner Davis ``have an edge'' as the  
top U.S. women's team, but added: ``I would learn from the past and 
say there's never a lock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno and Holly McPeak were the favorites at Atlanta, but they  
imploded under the pressure and tied for fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno and McPeak were first knocked off in '96 by Cook-Pottharst,  
who then beat Hanley-Barbra Fontana for the bronze medal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to hide anything. I still sometimes have  
nightmares about the bronze medal match in Atlanta,'' said Hanley, 
39 and the mother of two. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't care if that game was practice. It meant something  
to me,'' Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
	This competition was a stop on the Oldsmobile Alero Beach  
Volleyball Series and Heidger-Wong, who are both 6-foot-7, split 
$20,000 for first place. Johnson Jordan-Buckner Davis split $14,000 
and Reno-Hanley shared $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. softball team won two straight games against Australia,  
which has dealt the United States its only three losses since it 
won the gold medal at the 1996 Olympics. Australia won the bronze 
in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams pitched a two-hitter and struck out six. The U.S. was  
without top pitchers Lisa Fernandez and Michele Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has won three gold medals, including at the  
Pan American Games, in Nuveman's first year with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hasn't really all sunk in yet,'' Nuveman said. ``We have a  
lot to do, between now and Sydney.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canada, which failed to score in three previous games, beat New  
Zealand 8-1 for the bronze.

<HEADLINE>  'Ally McBeal,' 'Practice' Top Emmys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Emmy jurors have spoken: ``The Practice''  
and ``Ally McBeal,'' creator David E. Kelley's shows about the 
courtroom and bedroom antics of attorneys, are television's best 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you can see from the looks on our faces we're a little  
surprised, but we'll take it,'' said Kelley, who produces both 
shows. The awards came quickly one after the other Sunday in the 
best comedy and drama categories. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second consecutive win for ABC's ``The Practice.''  
The show's Holland Taylor and Michael Badalucco also swept the 
supporting actress and actor awards for a dramatic series. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory for Fox's ``Ally McBeal'' was unprecedented: It is  
an hourlong show competing in a category typically given over to 
half-hour sitcoms. It also broke the five-year winning streak of 
NBC's ``Frasier'' in this category. 
</P>
<P>
	No single producer has ever been responsible for best drama and  
comedy Emmys in the same year. 
</P>
<P>
	Helen Hunt won her fourth straight best comedy actress Emmy for  
the sentimental finale of NBC's ``Mad About You'' and John Lithgow 
was honored as top comedy actor for NBC's ``3rd Rock From the 
Sun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Emmy veteran, Dennis Franz of ABC's ``NYPD Blue,'' won  
his fourth trophy for best actor in a drama. He said he thought his 
co-star, Jimmy Smits, would win the award for the episode where 
Smits' character died. 
</P>
<P>
	Edie Falco, the long-suffering Mafia wife on HBO's ``The  
Sopranos,'' won the award for best actress in a drama series in the 
show's first season. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about the most surreal experience I could have  
imagined,'' said Miss Falco, who plays a soccer mom married to the 
mob. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Sopranos'' entered the night with the most nominations  
(16) but collected only one other Emmy Sunday, for best drama 
series writing. It won two technical awards earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Hunt's award tied a record for consecutive wins by a  
performer set in 1988 by John Larroquette for ``Night Court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Acknowledging co-star Paul Reiser and everyone involved in the  
show, Miss Hunt thanked ``a family of people that made it the most 
creative, safe, loving place to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lithgow accepted his third award for the NBC sitcom.  
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't know why I have won this. As far as I can tell  
every actor in this town thinks what I do on '3rd Rock' is 
completely disgraceful. I'm embarrassed myself,'' he joked. 
</P>
<P>
	HBO claimed the most number of Emmys, 23, a sign of the growing  
prominence and power of cable television. NBC was the leading 
broadcast network with 17 trophies, followed by ABC with 13, CBS 
with 11 and Fox with seven. 
</P>
<P>
	Kristen Johnston of ``3rd Rock From the Sun'' was named best  
supporting actress in a comedy and David Hyde Pierce won the 
supporting actor's honor for ``Frasier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``So glad I put on pants,'' said Emmy host Pierce, who had  
quickly changed into a tuxedo after wearing a purple unitard for a 
show-opening skit. It was his third Emmy. 
</P>
<P>
	Pierce and his co-host, Jenna Elfman of ``Dharma &AMP; Greg,''  
started the Shrine Auditorium ceremony by performing interpretive 
dance numbers poking fun at popular television series. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Leno may be clobbering David Letterman in the ratings, but  
Letterman's ``Late Show'' took the Emmy for best variety series for 
the second straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	``John Leguizamo's Freak'' won an Emmy for best performance in a  
variety or music program. Leguizamo thanked HBO, dubbing it the 
``Hispanic Box Office,'' and said he welcomed the chance to do his 
one-man show for TV because ``the Latin voice is something that's 
lacking and missing in the media.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke on the opening day of a two-week television viewing  
boycott organized by Hispanic groups angry at television because of 
its lack of ethnic diversity. The National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People is considering similar action. 
</P>
<P>
	A&AMP;E's ``Horatio Hornblower'' was named best miniseries and HBO's  
``A Lesson Before Dying'' captured the made-for-TV movie crown. 
</P>
<P>
	In the miniseries or movie grouping, Helen Mirren won best  
actress for Showtime's ``The Passion of Ayn Rand'' and Stanley 
Tucci of HBO's ``Winchell'' was best actor. Supporting acting 
honors went to Anne Bancroft for the CBS movie ``Deep in My Heart'' 
and to Peter O'Toole for the same network's miniseries ``Joan of 
Arc.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was even a father-son Emmy team. Paul Miller earned his  
first trophy for directing the 1998 Tonys, beating his father, 
Walter C. Miller. Later, dad picked up the award when the Tony 
telecast won for best variety special. The elder Miller was

<HEADLINE>  'Ally McBeal,' 'Practice' Top Emmys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Emmy jurors have spoken: ``The Practice''  
and ``Ally McBeal,'' creator David E. Kelley's shows about the 
courtroom and bedroom antics of attorneys, are television's best 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you can see from the looks on our faces we're a little  
surprised, but we'll take it,'' said Kelley, who produces both 
shows. The awards came quickly one after the other Sunday in the 
best comedy and drama categories. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second consecutive win for ABC's ``The Practice.''  
The show's Holland Taylor and Michael Badalucco also swept the 
supporting actress and actor awards for a dramatic series. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory for Fox's ``Ally McBeal'' was unprecedented: It is  
an hourlong show competing in a category typically given over to 
half-hour sitcoms. It also broke the five-year winning streak of 
NBC's ``Frasier'' in this category. 
</P>
<P>
	No single producer has ever been responsible for best drama and  
comedy Emmys in the same year. 
</P>
<P>
	Helen Hunt won her fourth straight best comedy actress Emmy for  
the sentimental finale of NBC's ``Mad About You'' and John Lithgow 
was honored as top comedy actor for NBC's ``3rd Rock From the 
Sun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Emmy veteran, Dennis Franz of ABC's ``NYPD Blue,'' won  
his fourth trophy for best actor in a drama. He said he thought his 
co-star, Jimmy Smits, would win the award for the episode where 
Smits' character died. 
</P>
<P>
	Edie Falco, the long-suffering Mafia wife on HBO's ``The  
Sopranos,'' won the award for best actress in a drama series in the 
show's first season. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about the most surreal experience I could have  
imagined,'' said Miss Falco, who plays a soccer mom married to the 
mob. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Sopranos'' entered the night with the most nominations  
(16) but collected only one other Emmy Sunday, for best drama 
series writing. It won two technical awards earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Hunt's award tied a record for consecutive wins by a  
performer set in 1988 by John Larroquette for ``Night Court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Acknowledging co-star Paul Reiser and everyone involved in the  
show, Miss Hunt thanked ``a family of people that made it the most 
creative, safe, loving place to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lithgow accepted his third award for the NBC sitcom.  
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't know why I have won this. As far as I can tell  
every actor in this town thinks what I do on '3rd Rock' is 
completely disgraceful. I'm embarrassed myself,'' he joked. 
</P>
<P>
	HBO claimed the most number of Emmys, 23, a sign of the growing  
prominence and power of cable television. NBC was the leading 
broadcast network with 17 trophies, followed by ABC with 13, CBS 
with 11 and Fox with seven. 
</P>
<P>
	Kristen Johnston of ``3rd Rock From the Sun'' was named best  
supporting actress in a comedy and David Hyde Pierce won the 
supporting actor's honor for ``Frasier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``So glad I put on pants,'' said Emmy host Pierce, who had  
quickly changed into a tuxedo after wearing a purple unitard for a 
show-opening skit. It was his third Emmy. 
</P>
<P>
	Pierce and his co-host, Jenna Elfman of ``Dharma &AMP; Greg,''  
started the Shrine Auditorium ceremony by performing interpretive 
dance numbers poking fun at popular television series. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Leno may be clobbering David Letterman in the ratings, but  
Letterman's ``Late Show'' took the Emmy for best variety series for 
the second straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	``John Leguizamo's Freak'' won an Emmy for best performance in a  
variety or music program. Leguizamo thanked HBO, dubbing it the 
``Hispanic Box Office,'' and said he welcomed the chance to do his 
one-man show for TV because ``the Latin voice is something that's 
lacking and missing in the media.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke on the opening day of a two-week television viewing  
boycott organized by Hispanic groups angry at television because of 
its lack of ethnic diversity. The National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People is considering similar action. 
</P>
<P>
	A&AMP;E's ``Horatio Hornblower'' was named best miniseries and HBO's  
``A Lesson Before Dying'' captured the made-for-TV movie crown. 
</P>
<P>
	In the miniseries or movie grouping, Helen Mirren won best  
actress for Showtime's ``The Passion of Ayn Rand'' and Stanley 
Tucci of HBO's ``Winchell'' was best actor. Supporting acting 
honors went to Anne Bancroft for the CBS movie ``Deep in My Heart'' 
and to Peter O'Toole for the same network's miniseries ``Joan of 
Arc.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was even a father-son Emmy team. Paul Miller earned his  
first trophy for directing the 1998 Tonys, beating his father, 
Walter C. Miller. Later, dad picked up the award when the Tony 
telecast won for best variety special. The elder Miller was 
executive producer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fifty years in the business and my son takes an Emmy away from  
me,'' the elder Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Winners in 52 categories were announced at the Emmy creative  
arts awards held Aug. 28. ``The Sopranos'' and ``Ally McBeal'' each 
won two trophies then. In last month's non-televised ceremony,

<HEADLINE> Fans Give Titans Mixed Reception </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tennessee fans finally feel they have an  
NFL team they can call their own, and they proved Sunday that they 
won't be shy about expressing their opinions. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though fans gave rave reviews to the Titans' $292 million  
Adelphia Coliseum, they alternately booed and cheered as Tennessee 
edged the Cincinnati Bengals 36-35. 
</P>
<P>
	Some players weren't happy with the boos directed at Steve  
McNair, who lost a fumble and was intercepted but threw three 
touchdowns and led the Titans to 10 fourth-quarter points. Coach 
Jeff Fisher chose to point out the cheering on the final drive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was awfully hard to hear out there,'' he said. ``Those are  
the kind of things we're talking about as far as home-field 
advantage. You don't realize it at times, but they're very 
significant. 
</P>
<P>
	A home-field advantage is something new for a team that spent  
two throwaway years as the Tennessee Oilers at the Liberty Bowl in 
Memphis and Vanderbilt Stadium in Nashville. The fans noticed the 
difference already. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like it's our team this year,'' said Phil Hobdy of  
Portland, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oilers had the lowest attendance in the NFL the last two  
seasons. This year, the Titans already have sold out five of their 
eight regular-season games at 67,700-seat Adelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Becky and Bill Beeler of Hendersonville bought season tickets  
last year at Vanderbilt, but only ended up going to one game at the 
41,100-seat college stadium that featured bleacher seating and no 
beer sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``The atmosphere was just not there at Vanderbilt Stadium,''  
Bill Beeler said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Beelers have bought season tickets again. How many games did  
they expect to attend this year? 
</P>
<P>
	``All of them,'' Becky Beeler said.  
</P>
<P>
	Bill Beeler said that the new logo, name, and stadium have all  
contributed to a feeling that was never there before. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that they've changed the name and they've changed the  
colors means it's our team now, rather than the Oilers,'' he said. 
``It's a whole lot different now. The first two years, you didn't 
know if it was a good decision to come here or not. But once the 
stadium was built, they got the fan support behind them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNair, who is in his fifth season in the league, has said the  
changes this year help him finally feel like an NFL player. 
Third-year defensive end Kenny Holmes, who played at the University 
of Miami, said most Titans felt they had better facilities in 
college until this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Adelphia Coliseum, which cost $292 million to build on the east  
bank of the Cumberland River, has quickly won over a lot of fans 
with its state-of-the-art amenities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's great,'' Becky Beeler said. ``It's very nice, and  
very clean. And there are lots of bathrooms, which is good.''

Martina Navratilova. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams teamed with her sister Venus to capture the doubles  
Sunday, defeating Chanda Rubin and Sandrine Testud 4-6, 6-1, 6-4, 
She won the singles crown Saturday with a 6-3, 7-6 (7-4) victory

</P>
<P>
	Last year, Williams and Max Mirnyi won the mixed doubles at the  
USTA National Tennis Center. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FLYING FINN:* Jarkko Nieminen upset top-seeded Kristian Pless  
of Denmark 6-7 (1-7), 6-4, 6-4 Sunday to win the U.S. Open Boys' 
singles title and become the first player from Finland to win a 
junior Grand Slam title since Birgitta Lindstrom captured the 
girls' crown at Wimbledon in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the best career performance by the left-handed Nieminen,  
a native of Masku, Finland. He reached the round of 16 at both the 
Australian and French Opens before losing in the first round at 
Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	Nieminen is the 1998 Finnish men's doubles indoor champion and  
was runner-up in the singles.

</P>
<P>
	 *OLD FOES:* Lina Krasnoroutskaia won the U.S. Open Girls'  
singles crown Sunday by defeating fellow Russian Nadejda Petrova 
6-3, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second straight Grand Slam tournament final for  
Krasnoroutskaia, who lost to Iroda Tulyaganova in the Wimbledon 
title match. 
</P>
<P>
	Petrova, who won the French Open junior title last year, was  
playing in her first junior tournament since the Australian Open in 
January, where she lost in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Krasnoroutskaia, who was seeded sixth, is from Obininski,  
Russia, while the second-seeded Petrova, who was born in Moscow, 
now lives in Krackow, Poland. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SUPER RATINGS:* The victory by Serena Williams in Saturday's  
women's final was a winner on CBS Television. 
</P>
<P>
	The network said the women's title match earned an overnight  
television household rating of 6.9 and share of 16, an increase of 
92 percent over last year. It was the highest-rated women's final 
since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The men's semifinal matches earned an overnight rating of 4.1  
and share of 11, up 32 percent over last year's two-match average 
of 3.1 and 8. 
</P>
<P>
	The rating is the percentage of TV households in the United  
States tuned to a program, and each point represents 994,000 homes.

with 62 aces, nearly triple the number the next highest player 
served in the tournament. Lindsay Davenport was second with 22. 
</P>
<P>
	The 62 aces is the most by a single player since complete  
tournament statistics have been kept on all 127 women's singles 
matches, beginning in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Chase Manhattan Bank, sponsor of the U.S. Open women's singles,  
donates $50 for every ace served in singles play to fund inner city 
tennis camps for girls. Williams was responsible for a record 
$3,100 of the final total of $25,750. 
</P>
<P>
	Irina Spirlea, who was the Chase Ace champion in each of the  
last two years, finished third this year with 19.

<HEADLINE> Asia Has Signs of Economic Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Fears of an economic meltdown have  
long since vanished, giving way to encouraging signs of recovery in 
many of Asia's trouble spots. 
</P>
<P>
	So instead of worrying about regional financial disasters  
exploding into a worldwide crisis, or seeking to engineer more 
massive bailouts, Pacific Rim leaders got a breather from fretting 
over serious economic woes and found their talks at the New Zealand 
summit overshadowed by the crisis in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from some short-lived market shocks in Indonesia as the  
violence in East Timor spun out of control last week, the economic 
doomsday scenarios from last year seemed a world away at this 
year's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rebound from the crisis from a year and a half or two  
years ago has proceeded better than expected,'' said Russell Jones, 
chief Asia economist at investment bank Lehman Brothers in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	But even though things are looking up everywhere from Japan, the  
region's financial dynamo, to South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, 
Thailand and Malaysia, not all is well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Probably, the economies have done the easy bit,'' Jones said,  
citing policies to spend money to stimulate growth as one example. 
``The difficult part is getting an expansion which is sustained. 
You have to address the issues that provoked the crisis to begin 
with, or you run the risk of a repeat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Along those lines, experts say many parts of Asia still need to  
improve market transparency, their banking systems, market 
regulations and openness -- the areas where problems festered for 
years in many Asian economies before blowing up in July 1997 when 
Thailand's currency, the baht, was devalued, setting off a chain 
reaction that swept the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock markets, which often act as an early barometer to  
financial recoveries, have been pointing for months to an upswing 
across Asia. Some of the real economic statistics are starting to 
bear out the bullish predictions, although much economic growth has 
come from a lower base level in economies that were walloped. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say Japan's economy is emerging from its worst  
recession since World War II and could show modest growth this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	But some caution that Japan's long climb back has been more a  
matter of cleaning up bad business practices and becoming more 
efficient rather than creating much of a bigger economic pie. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a jobless recovery -- there will be no jobs created,''  
said Jesper Koll, chief economist at investment bank Merrill Lynch 
in Tokyo. ``You've got Japan stable, gaining a competitive edge 
through domestic restructuring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The extended economic growth in the United States, a huge  
consumer of Asian goods, has lent a big helping hand across the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea's economy has been viewed as the star in the nascent  
recovery. Working to build back up with help from a $58 billion 
International Monetary Fund bailout package, the South Korean 
government is seeking to crack open the nation's closed business 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	The troubled conglomerate Daewoo is spinning off most of its  
subsidiaries, and President Kim Dae-jung is demanding reforms at 
other major chaebol, or conglomerates, including Hyundai, Samsung, 
LG and SK. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim says recovery is impossible if the heavily indebted  
conglomerates are not revamped, and he hopes to set a precedent 
``and straighten the economy so that it will grow on the basis of 
the middle class.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``South Korea's economic problem is multilayered,'' said Kim  
Byong-joo, an economics professor at Seoul's Sogang University. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem on the surface, the foreign currency crisis, is  
obviously over. They also have done a lot to reform the banking and 
corporate sectors. But our labor market is not as flexible as we 
hoped for. And if you go even deeper, you can see the government's 
control over the finance sector has actually increased after it 
nationalized several financial institutions.'' Seoul's efforts to 
revamp the banking sector hit a setback recently when the 
London-based banking giant HSBC Holdings pulled out of talks on 
buying a controlling stake in Seoulbank, which was taken over by 
the government and is supposed to be sold off under the IMF 
bailout. 
</P>
<P>
	The government then said it would inject another $3.75 billion  
into Seoulbank to make it more attractive to a foreign buyer.

<HEADLINE> John Travolta's Plane Forced To Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Actor John Travolta's plane was forced to make an  
emergency landing at Logan International Airport on Sunday after an 
engine overheated and shut down, an airport official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Travolta's private Boeing 707, carrying the actor and seven  
others, was forced to land about 3:30 p.m., Logan spokesman Phil 
Orlandella said. The plane's three other engines were working. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't clear if Travolta, a licensed pilot, was flying the  
plane, Orlandella said. He said Travolta left on another plane soon 
after the emergency landing. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane had been flying from Los Angeles to Bangor, Maine,  
where Travolta regularly lands when heading to his island home in 
Isleboro, Maine, about 30 miles south of Bangor. 
</P>
<P>
	Travolta's recent credits include ``A Civil Action'' and ``The  
General's Daughter.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Newspaper Publisher Silha Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Otto A. Silha, a former publisher and  
president of the Minneapolis Star and Tribune and a champion of 
media ethics, died Saturday. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Silha, who died of a heart attack, was diagnosed three weeks ago  
with multiple myeloma, a malignant tumor of the bone marrow, said a 
son, Stephen Silha. 
</P>
<P>
	Silha, a Chicago native, began his career in 1940 as a copy  
editor at the former Minneapolis Star. He spent 40 years with the 
Minneapolis Star and Tribune and Cowles Media Co., leaving for four 
years during World War II when he served in Air Force intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	He later became chief executive officer and chairman of the  
board of Cowles Media, the former owner of the Star Tribune, as the 
newspaper is now called. 
</P>
<P>
	Silha was a member of the board of directors of The Associated  
Press from 1978 to 1984, when he retired from publishing. 
</P>
<P>
	The University of Minnesota, his alma mater, announced in 1984  
it would establish the Silha Center for the Study of Media Ethics 
and Law within the university's School of Journalism and Mass 
Communication. 
</P>
<P>
	``Otto is the best benefactor you can imagine because he takes  
an active interest in a center but believes in letting the people 
in charge run it. There was not a week that went by that we were 
not in touch,'' said the center's director, Bill Babcock. 
</P>
<P>
	Silha gave about a half million dollars to help establish the  
center and contributed $1 million to the center this year. He also 
gave $1 million to establish a professorship in media ethics and 
law and made smaller gifts on a regular basis, Babcock said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The media had been his lifeblood,'' Babcock said. ``This was  
his way for giving a legacy so his dedication would continue to 
improve the media on both First Amendment and ethics issues. He was 
fascinated with accountability issues, how the media can be more 
accountable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After he retired, Silha formed Silha Associates, a national  
media and management consulting organization. 
</P>
<P>
	He also was active in civic affairs and was a member of the  
University of Minnesota Board of Regents from 1961 to 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of his death, Silha was chairman and president of  
CITY INNOVATION, a Minneapolis-based national volunteer program 
that he founded. It provides leadership for a networking approach 
to improving cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, Helen; sons Stephen and Mark Silha;  
a daughter, Alice Reimann; and three grandchildren. He was preceded 
in death by a son, David, who died in an avalanche in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	A memorial service is planned for Wednesday at Westminster  
Presbyterian Church in Minneapolis.

<HEADLINE> Survivors Recount Night on Glacier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The light through the clouds was so dull,  
Richard and Rhoneel Zell couldn't tell Herbert Glacier from the 
sky. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple and three fellow Californians left their cruise ship  
in Juneau, Alaska, on Friday for an afternoon helicopter flight 
over glaciers and icefields. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been one of the highlights of our tour,'' said  
Zell, 53. 
</P>
<P>
	But midway through the hour-long flight, the helicopter thudded  
into the glacier's icy surface. The five tourists and their pilot 
found themselves tumbling across an ice field in freezing 
temperatures with wind picking up. 
</P>
<P>
	``The helicopter flipped over. It went end over end. I don't  
think the pilot knew it was going to hit,'' Zell said in Sunday's 
San Francisco Examiner. ``We were so amazed when everybody got out 
of the copter and was relatively OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With no idea when help might come, the group began shoveling  
snow into banks to block the wind and build a makeshift igloo 
around the crashed helicopter cab. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a man who was 72 years old and he was out there  
shoveling with the rest of us,'' Zell said of fellow tourist 
William McIntyre Sr. ``He was one of the bravest guys I've ever 
met.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two rescue helicopters sent by the excursion company, Temsco  
Helicopters of Juneau, also crashed on the glacier in the flat 
lighting conditions, stranding four company workers near the 
tourists. 
</P>
<P>
	A nine-member mountain rescue team was then sent with snowsuits  
and tents to rescue the tourists and their ill-fated rescuers. But 
all 19 people had to spend the night on the glacier because of bad 
weather and darkness. 
</P>
<P>
	The group huddled together drinking hot cocoa and trying to stay  
awake. 
</P>
<P>
	The Zells and McIntyre, along with McIntyre's 40-year-old son,  
William Jr., both of Irvine, Calif., were treated for cuts and 
bruises. Tourist Deborah Morgan, 42, of Placentia, Calif., was 
treated for a broken ankle. The pilot was not identified. 
</P>
<P>
	The Zells, meanwhile, planned to cut their trip short and return  
to California. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we'll go home and call it a day,'' Zell said. ``We're  
just grateful to be alive. ... It certainly was an Alaska adventure 
all right.''

<HEADLINE> Quotes From Emmy Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Quotes from Sunday night's Emmys:  
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't know why I have won this. As far as I can tell,  
every actor in this town thinks what I do on `3rd Rock From the 
Sun' is completely disgraceful. ... I'm embarrassed myself.'' -- 
John Lithgow after winning comedy series actor Emmy for ``3rd Rock 
From the Sun.'' 

</P>
<P>
	``If someone were to ask me the fastest or best way to win an  
Emmy, I'd say write a script and get Calista Flockhart to say the 
words.'' -- Producer David E. Kelley after his show ``Ally McBeal'' 
won best comedy series Emmy. 

</P>
<P>
	``Dad, I'm sorry, and maybe next year. ... I want to dedicate  
this to my father, who's celebrating his 50th year in this crazy 
business.'' -- Paul Miller, best director for a variety or music 
program for the ``1998 Tony Awards.'' His father, Walter C. Miller, 
was nominated in the same category for the ``41st Annual Grammy 
Awards.'' 

</P>
<P>
	``I just want to make one comment before I read my little list  
here. Kids have no respect -- to think that my son would take an 
Emmy away from his father. Fifty years in the business and my son 
takes an Emmy away from me. Anyhow, congratulations Paul.'' -- 
Walter C. Miller after accepting an Emmy in a different category 
for ``1998 Tony Awards.'' 

</P>
<P>
	``We're back with more of the Emmy Awards, all the laughs and  
the tears and the length of a telethon, only we're not helping 
anyone.'' -- Host David Hyde Pierce after a commercial break more 
than two hours into the show. 

</P>
<P>
	``Now this was TV in the beginning. It was mysterious and full  
of snow, kind of like George W. Bush's past.'' -- Bill Maher, host 
of ``Politically Incorrect,'' introducing a segment on television 
technology past and future. 

</P>
<P>
	``The Latin voice is something that is lacking and very missing  
in the media.'' -- John Leguizamo, who won best variety or music 
performance Emmy for his HBO special ``John Leguizamo's Freak.'' 

</P>
<P>
	``Without Steven Bochco and his commitment to diversity, which  
to him means get the best people, look a little harder, I wouldn't 
be here, either.'' -- Paris Barclay, winner for best director in a 
drama series for ``NYPD Blue.'' 

</P>
<P>
	``Personally, these last nine months have left a lot to be  
desired. My thanks for all your good wishes. And my wish for you is 
that you enjoy the miracle of life, each and every precious moment 
and that you appreciate this special medium of which we are all so 
privileged to be a part.'' -- Actor Robert Guillaume, a presenter, 
who had a stroke in January and got a standing ovation as he walked 
to the podium using a cane. 

</P>
<P>
	``I'm not nominated this year because there's apparently a  
little rule that you have to have a show on the air. It's always 
something.'' -- Presenter Garry Shandling.

<HEADLINE> Asian Leaders Confront Y2K Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Asian and Pacific heads of state  
began their first full session of meetings Sunday by tackling a 
profound philosophical question: when to celebrate the new 
millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart, briefing reporters  
afterward, said a lively discussion ensued over whether the 
celebration should come on Jan. 1, 2000 -- or a year later. 
</P>
<P>
	Calendar purists contend that the 21st century does not begin  
until Jan. 1, 2001. But politicians are seldom known for embracing 
purism. 
</P>
<P>
	New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley, the host for this  
year's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, noted her island 
nation would be celebrating the millennium first, no matter when it 
began, due to its relative proximity to the international date 
line. 
</P>
<P>
	She offered ``to report'' to the others on when the millennium  
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	``After some discussion, I think the leaders came to the  
conclusion that since their public, to which they all like to be 
attuned, will be celebrating in 2000, they will start celebrating 
in 2000,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And that was the conclusion of that philosophical debate,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Did President Clinton take a position?  
</P>
<P>
	``I think the president was in a category shared by some others  
that thought 2000 was right because they'd still be in office,'' 
Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	After some laughter, Lockhart amended his remarks: ``Although  
the president will be in office in 2001. I do understand that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's term runs through Jan. 20, 2001.  
</P>
<P>
	The 2000 APEC meeting will be in Brunei, where leaders may want  
to take another crack at the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 

</P>
<P>
	President Clinton's first meeting with Russian Prime Minister  
Vladimir Putin did not exactly come off exactly like clockwork. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was to ``greet'' Putin publicly in the lobby of  
Auckland's Stamford Plaza Hotel, where the American delegation has 
been staying. A black backdrop was set up in the corner of the 
hotel lobby for the handshake. 
</P>
<P>
	Putin and his entourage came in -- and disappeared behind the  
backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton entered from the other side and stood in front of the  
backdrop and an American and a Russian flag. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hello everyone,'' Clinton said to assembled reporters and  
photographers. He looked around. A few awkward moments followed. 
``Where is he?'' Clinton muttered, as if to himself. 
</P>
<P>
	After a few seconds, Putin emerged from behind the backdrop and  
took his proper place. ``Nice to meet you. Welcome,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Cardinal O'Connor Returns to Pulpit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cardinal John O'Connor drew laughter at St.  
Patrick's Cathedral on Sunday as he made his first public 
appearance since surgery for a brain tumor. 
</P>
<P>
	The appearance came just over a week after he was released from  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Medical Center. He has not said whether 
the tumor was malignant or what his prognosis might be. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been a truly marvelous funeral,'' he joked to 2,500  
worshippers. ``I've enjoyed every bit of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor, 79, recalled hearing the news that he had a brain  
tumor and said: ``You could hardly expect to hear words more filled 
with dread than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he called the surgery ``extraordinarily successful.''  
Although he did not use the word cancer, he said radiation therapy 
had ``cleaned up any possible debris'' from the growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been so many prayers, so many cards, so many  
messages,'' O'Connor said. ``It's impossible for me to keep up, but 
I'm told we're making a lot of money for the archdiocese selling 
flowers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Standing unassisted, the cardinal delivered the homily for the  
Mass, which was dedicated to workers in honor of Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that his father was a union member, who worked applying  
gold leaf to ornate architectural designs, and quipped: ``When 
there was serious consideration of this, I insisted that my casket 
have a union label.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connnor also joked that he had sent the Pope lists that have  
appeared in the media with names of his potential successors. ``He 
hasn't yet told me who that will be, if or when,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he plans to retire when he turns 80 on Jan. 15. Church  
law prohibits cardinals from voting for a new pope or holding 
certain church offices after age 80. He has been cardinal of the 
2.2 million-member diocese, which covers 10 New York counties, 
since 1984.

<HEADLINE> Jet Casing Falls Before Plane Lands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- A 200-pound piece of engine casing from  
a Continental Airlines jet landed on an empty street Sunday after 
the engine failed soon after takeoff, forcing the pilot to return 
for an emergency landing. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight 1933, a Boeing 737, was headed for Houston when one of  
its engines failed, Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman 
Kathleen Bergen said from Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The piece of engine cover landed on the empty street, causing no  
damage or injuries, said Jim Craft, operations supervisor with the 
Palm Beach County Department of Airports. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane, carrying 84 passengers, returned to Palm Beach  
International and landed safely. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking into it,'' Bergen said of the engine failure.  
``At this point, we don't know what happened.''

<HEADLINE> Solution Sought for Fed Housing Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It would break Pat Casola's heart to leave  
Cambridge, Mass., but she may be forced to move to a cheaper 
community if her landlord drops out of a federally subsidized 
housing program in order to seek higher rents on the open market. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mother was born and raised in Cambridge, her mother was  
raised and lived all her life in Cambridge,'' said Casola, a 
disabled 46-year-old woman who lives with her boyfriend in a U.S. 
Department of Housing and Urban Development complex. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal contract for Casola's subsidized apartment complex  
expired in May and was extended temporarily until this month's end. 
After that, the building may be privatized unless her landlord gets 
into a new HUD program to provide him with higher rents. 
</P>
<P>
	Casola now pays just $384 a month for her two-bedroom apartment;  
the building's most expensive units rent for $822. If the building 
is privatized, Casola would get a year's rental voucher. After 
that, if she had to move, ``I would feel a personal loss,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Casola is among the tens of thousands of tenants across the  
country who have lost their subsidized HUD housing -- or risk losing 
it -- as landlords drop out of the federal program known as 
``Section 8'' to seek higher rents on the open market. 
</P>
<P>
	Over a period of 2 1/2 years, ending in December 1998, nearly  
100,000 units of HUD housing, most of it administered under the 
Section 8 program for low-income elderly, disabled and families, 
have been lost, according to the nonprofit National Housing Trust. 
</P>
<P>
	By 2004, HUD contracts covering 1 million units -- some in every  
state -- are due to expire. About half of those units are at risk 
because their rents are below market rates, according to the trust. 
</P>
<P>
	What the landlords are doing is legal. Some, after participating  
in the Section 8 program for many years, have decided not to renew 
their contracts when they come due. Others prepay their mortgages 
to get out of the program, or they exercise options to drop out of 
the program after 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But the losses have generated tremendous concern among advocates  
for the poor, HUD tenants and members of Congress who -- beginning 
this month -- will consider various measures to reverse the trend. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot to be said for not displacing people,'' said  
Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Banking 
and Financial Services' housing subcommittee, who has worked on the 
Section 8 problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Bills drafted in the House and Senate would, in part, carve into  
law a program that HUD began earlier this year to keep landlords in 
the Section 8 housing program with an incentive -- raising their 
rents to market levels in certain, highly vulnerable parts of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Under one part of the 25-year-old Section 8 program, tenants  
contribute about 30 percent of their income to rent. The government 
pays the difference between that and its estimate of the 
apartment's cost on the open market. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as various bills have been drafted, however, there is  
concern that Congress -- because of spending caps imposed by the 
Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and the Republican-proposed $792 
billion tax cut -- will not approve enough money for HUD's 2000 
budget to render the measures effective. The new fiscal year starts 
Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good that Congress and the Clinton administration are  
talking about'' housing preservation, said Michael Kane, executive 
director of the National Alliance of HUD Tenants. But, ``If the tax 
cut is to pass, it's kind of a moot issue. There won't be money for 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the House, a draft bill combining earlier Democratic and  
Republican proposals would require HUD to offer market-level rents 
to landlords in vulnerable areas. In exchange, the landlords would 
have to commit to the Section 8 program for five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, spearheaded by Banking Chairman Jim Leach, R-Iowa, and  
Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., the housing subcommittee chairman, also 
would provide market-level vouchers so tenants could stay in their 
buildings even after the buildings have gone private, and would 
promote building sales to nonprofit organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	The full House is to consider that bill later this month. It  
also includes a state matching grant program to preserve housing, 
and provisions to preserve senior citizen housing under a separate 
HUD program, ``Section 202.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, a bill by Republican Christopher Bond of  
Missouri, the chairman of the Appropriations' subcommittee on HUD, 
would require HUD to offer higher rents to targeted landlords -- in 
exchange for a 10-year commitment -- and promote sales to 
nonprofits. 
</P>
<P>
	A separate bipartisan bill, introduced by Health, Education,  
Labor and Pensions Chairman James Jeffords, R-Vt., would create a 
matching grant program similar to what's in the House bill. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the bills would compel owners to stay in Section 8,  
although lawmakers hope that the incentives would be enough to do 
the trick. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost of the measures is unclear. The Congressional Budget  
Office has not come up with a figure, and HUD itself has offered 
partial estimates: about $100 million a year for the rental 
increases, and about $30 million for the enhanced vouchers.

<HEADLINE> NCR Offering Early Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- NCR Corp. is offering an early retirement  
plan to 1,200 of its technicians to save about 30 percent in labor 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, a leading manufacturer of checkout scanners and  
automated teller machines machines, plans to replace some of the 
retirees with lower-cost personnel, outsource the work or buy a 
company that does their jobs, spokesman John Hourigan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fewer field engineers and managers are needed because more  
repairs on ATMs and other equipment can be done remotely, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The division has 2,800 field engineers and managers who have an  
average of 22 years of seniority. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan will allow employees who are at least 55 years old and  
have 10 years of service to retire without penalties. Normally, 
employees incur a 6 percent pension reduction for each year that 
they retire before age 62. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan also gives a severance payment to anyone with 30 years  
or more service as of Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	About half of the 1,200 who are eligible are expected to accept  
the offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayton-based NCR employs 33,500 workers worldwide. The company  
had 1998 profits of $122 million on sales of $6.5 billion.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Perfecting Decaf Coffee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- The future of caffeine-free coffee is taking  
shape in petri dishes at the University of Hawaii, where scientists 
are growing plants that will produce beans without the buzz. 
</P>
<P>
	But don't expect to drink a genetically engineered double-mocha  
decaf anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
	The first plants won't be available to commercial growers before  
2003, with the first caffeine-free cups of java to be sold in 2006, 
according to John Stiles, assistant professor of plant physiology. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decaffeinated coffee you have now is treated chemically to  
remove the caffeine, and that changes the structure of the bean,'' 
Stiles said. ``In our process the bean just wouldn't have it to 
begin with. The quality will be higher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The university, in conjunction with Integrated Coffee  
Technologies, now is field-testing caffeine-free plants. 
</P>
<P>
	The first commercial crop will produce about 250,000 pounds,  
enough coffee for several million cups, said Stiles, who also is 
director of scientific research for Integrated. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee is one of Hawaii's top five crops. First introduced to  
King Kamehameha I in 1813, coffee was grown on 7,000 acres and 
generated $28.2 million in 1997, according to the state agriculture 
department. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's best known coffee is grown on the Kona side of the  
island of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	Decaffeinated coffee accounts for up to 25 percent of U.S.  
coffee sales, which reached $4 billion in 1997, according to the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawaii-based company so far has invested $750,000 in the  
project and expects to spend another $500,000 to grow the first 
plants, Stiles said. Seed money came from the state of Hawaii, with 
additional funding from venture capitalists. 
</P>
<P>
	The state university owns the patent for the bean and the  
process that created it and is leasing that to Integrated. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto Corp., in turn, is leasing to Integrated some of the  
procedures used in extracting the caffeine gene. Monsanto will 
share revenues from the sales of plants and beans and the future 
licensing of the technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Each plant will sell for up to $1.50, about three times the  
current price. 
</P>
<P>
	Integrated will market the plants to specialty growers more  
willing to absorb the higher cost and eager to offer better tasting 
coffee to customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Growers eventually will save money after the cost of  
decaffeination -- which can reach 25 percent of the cost of the 
coffee -- is factored in, Stiles said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Farmers will make back that additional cost in one or two  
years of harvest,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The project also has received interest from coffee growers  
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking with some of the major U.S. coffee roasters, but  
we have nothing definite yet,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Coffee Growers Association and Hawaii Coffee  
Growers Association said they knew nothing about the caffeine-free 
bean. 
</P>
<P>
	Maxwell House Coffee spokeswoman Mary Jane Kinkade said the  
company is monitoring the project. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for the Starbucks coffee chain said the company  
won't decide on the beans until they are grown and tasted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether this is something we would offer would depend on when  
we could test those beans,'' Helen Chung said. ``It would depend on 
the quality of the beans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The idea for a caffeine-free bean began brewing in 1991, when  
Stiles was having a beer with colleagues and was asked if there was 
a way to use biotechnology to remove caffeine from coffee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't work with coffee at the time, so I thought about it  
and said, `Yeah, this is the sort of thing you should be able to 
do,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years later, he and his team succeeded in isolating the  
protein that creates the caffeine gene. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists then isolated the gene and removed it through a  
process called anti-sense, which removes the regular coffee gene, 
turns it backwards and reinserts it, Stiles said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you stop the gene's activities so the protein can't be  
made, the caffeine can't be made,'' Stiles said. ``Some proteins 
are easy to isolate, some are hard. This one was hard. Which in a 
way is probably good for us, or else someone would have done this 
before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stiles' team is the first to successfully breed a plant without  
the caffeine gene, following failed attempts by several groups 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Grace of Qusac Decaf Inc., a Canada-based decaffeinator,  
said the company isn't worried by the threat posed by a 
caffeine-free bean, saying such a bean likely will find a niche as 
a specialty product. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may be caffeine-free, but it may also not have other  
characteristics of coffee,'' he said. ``In the end it's got to 
taste reasonable.''

<HEADLINE> Mobile Remembers 1979 Hurricane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOBILE, Ala. (AP) -- Just after nightfall, the wind whipped surf  
across deserted coastal roads as Hurricane Frederic roared out of 
the Gulf of Mexico and slammed into Mobile. 
</P>
<P>
	With wind gusting to more than 140 mph, Frederic battered the  
coast and the bayside city of 200,000 during the night of Sept. 12, 
1979. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm caused only one death in the Mobile area -- a  
4-year-old girl crushed by a falling refrigerator as her family's 
mobile home overturned in Theodore. 
</P>
<P>
	But, at the time, it was the nation's costliest hurricane, with  
damage estimated at $2.1 billion and insured losses of $752.5 
million. And it remains a vivid memory to tens of thousands across 
the Alabama coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``My parents had nothing left. The business was leveled,'' said  
Marguerite Noel. She now runs the Nuttin Fancy diner a few miles 
from where her father, 72-year-old Al Ward, had a fishing camp on 
the Dog River south of Mobile. 
</P>
<P>
	As Frederic approached, Ward packed all his tools into a 30-foot  
trailer and fled to his daughter's home. He never saw the trailer 
or his fishing camp again; nothing but a concrete slab was left 
where his store once stood. 
</P>
<P>
	Before striking Mobile, Frederic had already obliterated much  
that was standing on the band of Alabama coastline called Pleasure 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember it was like a bomb set off. It blew everything  
away,'' said Danny Williams, who was 8 years old when Frederic hit 
and who now tends bar at the Pink Pony Pub on the beach at Gulf 
Shores. 
</P>
<P>
	The hurricane -- rated a Category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson Scale,  
with 5 the most intense -- hammered its worst wave surge into Gulf 
Shores, with water rising 15.7 feet above mean sea level. The sandy 
barrier island is more or less at sea level. 
</P>
<P>
	Frederic virtually cleared the resort island of homes and  
businesses, spreading splintered wreckage across the white sand and 
opening the door for the vast resort developments that jam the 
shoreline today. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners of small, single-family homes collected their insurance  
claims and moved out, leaving tracts for commercial development 
that prospered as Americans flocked to Sunbelt locales like 
Pleasure Island. 
</P>
<P>
	The building boom also brought environmental scrutiny.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's a lot more protection of the beaches, more  
planned development now,'' said condo builder Gene Brett, who has 
built multistory structures with thick concrete walls to protect 
against the next hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gerald King, a Gulf Shores developer, said a storm the size  
of Frederic today still would inflict heavy financial losses 
because of the heavy tourist investment along the shore. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands had jammed evacuation routes and pressed into shelters  
as Frederick bore down on Mobile, while thousands more boarded up 
windows and huddled in homes. 
</P>
<P>
	King was one of those who stayed, riding out the storm in a  
house at Perdido Beach with several other families. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a mistake,'' he said. ``Before the night was over I  
was very sorry I was there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The next morning, people emerged shaken and dazed.  
</P>
<P>
	Leah York said she just couldn't believe the destruction.  
</P>
<P>
	``You couldn't go down the main highway for the tree limbs,''  
said York, whose mobile home had only minor damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The city itself, known for its stately live oaks, was littered  
with fallen limbs, utility poles and dangling electrical wires, 
making driving almost impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	Electrical power was out for several weeks in some area of  
Mobile -- for over a month at Dauphin Island. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frederic was pretty stout,'' said Williams, tending bar at  
Gulf Shores. ``You judge all other storms by that one.''

<HEADLINE> Browns' Dawgs Happy To Be Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Before Dawg Pounders let out their first bark  
or threw back their first beers, they already knew the result of 
Sunday's night game with the Pittsburgh Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
	They won.  
</P>
<P>
	After three seasons without football and having their Cleveland  
Browns stolen out from under them, it was all over Sunday night. 
They had survived, won back their team and their colors as the 
season -- the real season, no exhibition games -- finally got under 
way against the archival Steelers. It was time to party. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a bunch of crazed dogs and we're battling back,'' said  
Kevin Hepburn as he and his buddy, Jim Istenes, tied up their motor 
boat ``Sick Puppy'' at a dock on Lake Erie just outside the 
stadium. ``I've been sad since they moved. We've been waiting a 
long time. But this is brand new.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Never mind the fact that the Steelers crushed the Browns 43-0.  
This was a day-long celebration that climaxed when hometown 
comedian Drew Carey introduced the Browns as the crowd howled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anyone who's told a Cleveland joke before -- you can now  
officially shut up,'' Carey shouted as the Browns ran onto the 
field and fireworks exploded overhead. 
</P>
<P>
	Downtown Cleveland was awash in orange, brown and goofy outfits  
a full four hours before kickoff, the first regular-season home 
game for the Browns since December 1995. Scalpers got $200 for 
tickets and were asking as much as $500, fans said. 
</P>
<P>
	In parking lots stretching more than a mile from the new  
stadium, people set up camp behind cars, trucks, buses and vans, 
firing up their grills and cracking open a few cold drinks. All the 
Clevelanders were loving their Browns and ready to celebrate with 
anybody wearing a dog bone. 
</P>
<P>
	A band of folks with seats in the Dawg Pound, the end zone  
section that's the domain of the Browns most rabid faithful, hung 
out in a private lot close to the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	When they saw a truck driving by with a couch in the back --  
painted orange with brown and white stripes like Cleveland's helmet 
and the words ``Tim Couch'' emblazoned on it -- they called the 
driver over and offered a free parking spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our No. 1 draft pick!'' yelled Dave Bletsh as a couple of guys  
unloaded the couch and joined the party. ``We had to have that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The couch artist, Tim Johnson, was dressed head-to-toe in orange  
and brown and wore slippers that looked like footballs on his feet. 
He talked about what made him repaint his tan sofa in honor of 
Cleveland's rookie quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just came right in my head,'' he said. ``I didn't think  
anybody else would do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a parking lot on the other side of the stadium, Tuck Leckey  
showed off a tattoo of a helmeted dog he got just for the game. 
Leckey and his friend, Terry Doseck, drove up to Cleveland from 
southwest Ohio without tickets, but picked them up for $200 each. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been a Browns fan all my life, and I just got this,'' he  
said. ``It's not done yet. We're going to fence him in and put a 
collar on him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Everybody was glad that when the Browns finally came back, it  
was against the Steelers. Even Pittsburgh fans were happy to see 
the rivalry renewed in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had a lot of garbage rain down on me already,'' said Roy  
Lane, sporting a Kordell Stewart jersey. ``But that's all right. 
It's been a long time and we're glad to have them back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bletsh agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's Pittsburgh and Cleveland and nothing else,'' he said.  
``There is no other rivalry.''

<HEADLINE> Money Laundering Explained </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	While money laundering can take on many variations, experts say  
it always basically works in a three-step cycle: moving illicit 
money, such as drug trafficking profits, away from direct 
association with crimes; disguising the money trail; and making the 
money available to the criminals again with its illegal origins 
hidden. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks in offshore areas such as islands of the Caribbean and the  
Channel Islands off Britain, where local laws foster bank and 
corporate secrecy, often play a key role. 
</P>
<P>
	Profits from drug trafficking and other criminal activities  
often move through a series of bank accounts to make them appear as 
proceeds of legitimate business activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Several fundamental rules are at play in money laundering,  
according to the U.N. Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention, 
including: 
</P>
<P>
	--More successful money launderers imitate the patterns of  
legitimate financial transactions, the smaller the chance they will 
be caught. 
</P>
<P>
	--The more deeply embedded illegal activities are within the  
legal economy, the harder it is to detect money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	--Banks and other financial institutions with smaller proportions  
of illegal transactions and larger proportions of legal ones are 
better for hiding money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	--The higher the ratio of services to production of goods in an  
economy, the more easily money laundering can be conducted in it. 
</P>
<P>
	--Production and distribution networks for goods and services  
that are dominated by small, independent firms or self-employed 
people make it harder for authorities to distinguish between legal 
and illegal transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	--Countries with laws allowing more liberal and deregulated  
financial transactions are better for hiding criminal money flows. 
</P>
<P>
	--As financial markets become increasingly global and  
interconnected, money laundering becomes more difficult to detect.

<HEADLINE> Seattle Stars Want Team Upgraded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- With three weeks left in the season, Ken Griffey  
Jr. is pressuring the Seattle Mariners to upgrade the team this 
winter or trade him. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners have heard Griffey's mantra before, but it now has  
more urgency as he and Alex Rodriguez enter what could be the final 
weeks of their Seattle careers. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, I figure if they can't work anything out with Alex by  
spring training, they're going to trade him,'' Griffey told the 
Seattle Post-Intelligencer on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``And if I don't sign anything by April, they're going to look  
to trade me, because the one thing I don't think they want is 
having to deal with the Randy Johnson situation all over again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After months of disgruntled play by Johnson in a contract  
dispute, the Mariners traded their ace to Houston in July 1998. He 
later signed a $52.4 million free-agent contract with Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no idea what's going to happen this winter, no idea,''  
said Rodriguez, whose dual free agency with Griffey after next 
season is the club's most critical issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners' front office won't talk about trading either star.  
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing absolutely crystal clear is we want to do  
everything we can to have Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez play 
their entire careers as Seattle Mariners,'' club president Chuck 
Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey isn't opposed to that if the team can win.  
</P>
<P>
	``What the team fails to realize is that I'm going to get paid  
whether I stay or go, so it's not about the money,'' he said. 
``It's about getting a winning team, having a city fall in love 
with the players on the field, having an organization that will, 
number one, do anything for the player and their family, and also 
if the team needs something, be creative enough to go get it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``The money's definitely here,'' Rodriguez said. ``We definitely  
have the money to afford a first-class team. This stadium gives you 
avenues where you can be a big-market team. 
</P>
<P>
	``A competitive team, to me, is 30 to 40, or 20 to 30 games over  
.500 -- not .500 baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owners of the Mariners, virtually eliminated from the playoff  
picture this season, have given no indication that payroll for next 
year will be higher than the $53 million on opening day this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey and agent Brian Goldberg were presented with offers last  
fall and twice this season, the last a reported seven-year, $135 
million package. Rodriguez and his agent, Scott Boras, expect to 
begin negotiations in November. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their thing is, 'Let's sign the big man on campus and we can  
say to the people of Seattle, 'Hey, we're trying,''' Griffey said. 
``I'm not saying that's me, but it's like college football -- let's 
sign the top recruit and then everybody will want to come here. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did that with my last contract. Now it's time (they) go out  
and sign people and then come to me.''

<HEADLINE> Don't Ask Vonnegut To Read Aloud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Kurt Vonnegut will visit, he will talk.  
Just don't ask him to read aloud. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never done a reading. It's the lowest art form  
imaginable,'' Vonnegut said. 
</P>
<P>
	When he comes to St. Paul next weekend, Vonnegut will be  
acknowledging his new short-story collection, ``Bagombo Snuff Box'' 
-- gathered with the help of a local professor -- but he's got too 
much on his mind to merely recite old prose. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll talk about stuff that bothers me, like the way people are  
being cheated out of the experience of `becoming.' It's the 
computer which becomes now. People think, `Oh, boy, wait until I 
get this new program.' Bill Gates will give you a program to write 
a perfect Shakespearean sonnet. For God's sake, that's not 
becoming,'' Vonnegut said. 
</P>
<P>
	``People should practice an art in order to make their souls  
grow and not to make money or become famous. Paint a picture. 
Write.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vonnegut will share his thoughts Saturday at Central  
Presbyterian Church in St. Paul.

<HEADLINE> Thurman Thomas Injured by Hit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Veteran Buffalo running back Thurman Thomas  
injured his ribs on the first play of Sunday's game with the 
Indianapolis Colts when he was hit on a pass pattern. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, 33, was hit hard by Indianapolis cornerback Tyrone Poole  
while attempting to catch a pass from Doug Flutie. He walked to the 
sidelines on his own after being checked on the field and was later 
taken to the dressing room. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, who made his 158th NFL start, did not return to the game  
and spent the second half on the sideline in civilian clothes as 
his team lost to Indianapolis 31-14. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were going to start Thurman in the game and a lot of our  
running game involved Thurman, '' Buffalo coach Wade Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know for sure. He got a shot in the ribs obviously,''  
Phillips said. The X-rays were negative, but we are still looking 
at him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without Thomas, the Bills were held to 47 yards rushing on 15  
carries. In his career, Thomas has more rushing attempts and 
rushing yards than any other back against the Colts with 304 rushes 
for 1,230 yards.

<HEADLINE> 'Stigmata' Overtakes 'Sixth Sense' / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Stigmata'' edged ``The Sixth Sense'' at the  
box office in its debut weekend, ending the Bruce Willis thriller's 
five-week run as North America's favorite film, according to 
industry estimates Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stigmata,'' featuring Patricia Arquette as a hairdresser who  
manifests the wounds of Christ and Gabriel Byrne as a priest sent 
to investigate, earned $19.3 million in ticket sales, while ``The 
Sixth Sense'' took in $17 million, according to Exhibitor Relations 
Co. Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stir of Echoes,'' starring Kevin Bacon, was third with $6.2  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though ``The Sixth Sense'' dropped to No. 2 in its sixth  
week, it still garnered a respectable turnout with the help of 
repeat business, said Chuck Viane, head of distribution at Buena 
Vista. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the end is so satisfying and so surprising that people  
walk out of the theater and just can't wait to see it again,'' 
Viane said. 
</P>
<P>
	With ``Stigmata,'' the struggling distributor MGM had two movies  
in the top 10 as ``The Thomas Crown Affair'' tied for sixth place, 
earning $2.9 million in its sixth week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a long time since MGM has had two movies in the top  
10. We're very pleased,'' said Larry Gleason, president of world 
wide distribution. ``We're back again as a serious contender.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only other new movie to open in wide release, ``Love  
Stinks,'' didn't make the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North  
American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final 
figures are to be released Monday.

<HEADLINE> NTSB Wary of Boeing 737 Rudders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Efforts to fix rudder problems in the Boeing 737,  
the world's most common jetliner, have not eliminated malfunctions 
that ``could be catastrophic,'' the National Transportation Safety 
Board concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report released in July, the board detailed its  
investigation into the 1991 crash of United Airlines Flight 585 in 
1991 in Colorado Springs, Colo., and the crash of USAir Flight 427 
near Pittsburgh in 1994. All 157 people on the two 737s died. 
</P>
<P>
	The 737 is the only commercial jet with a rudder controlled by a  
single hydraulic valve. Other jets have multiple valves that can 
compensate for each other if one jams. 
</P>
<P>
	The single valve has shown a tendency to jam, causing rogue  
deflections of the sort that apparently affected a Metrojet flight 
in February, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The crew reported that the rudder pedal appeared to move without  
being touched, at one point causing the 737-200 to turn to the 
right. The crew managed to land safely, partly by shutting down the 
plane's main hydraulic system. Had the rudder remained jammed, the 
plane could have rolled into a high-speed dive. 
</P>
<P>
	The NTSB report lists 112 such ``rudder events'' on Boeing 737  
flights in the past two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 737 series airplanes ... remain susceptible to rudder  
system malfunctions that could be catastrophic,'' the 346-page 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Redesigning the rudder -- the largest moving part of the jet --  
could cost Boeing hundreds of millions of dollars and cause 
uncounted airline disruptions for airplane modifications. There are 
3,111 Boeing 737s in use worldwide, as many as 800 in the air at 
any given time. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing and Federal Aviation Administration officials say an  
upgraded rudder valve installed over the past two years on all 737s 
registered in the United States and many registered abroad have 
made a safe jet even safer. 
</P>
<P>
	The 737 crashes on average less than two times per million  
departures, a record Boeing officials say rivals that of any other 
commercial jet. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, the safety board requested that the FAA convene a  
panel to consider further rudder changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We await (the panel's) findings and recommendations of what,  
if anything, can be done to improve the rudder system,'' Boeing 
spokesman Russ Young said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not known whether rudder problems contributed to the crash  
of a 737 in Argentina on Aug. 31 or of another in Turkey in April. 
Flight data tapes from those planes and 737s that went down in 
Indonesia in 1997 and Peru in 1998 have not been recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Problems with the rudder system were reported three decades ago.  
</P>
<P>
	Engineers at Bertea Corp., which contracted with Boeing in the  
late 1960s to mass-produce the 737's rudder valve in Irvine, 
Calif., obtained patents in 1969 and 1982 on devices to correct the 
jamming problem but found no buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``One failure ... occurs when the valve becomes stuck or  
jammed,'' the 1969 patent cautions. ``This may be the result of 
contaminants ... warpage, thermal expansion or contraction of the 
elements of (the valve) or numerous other reasons.''

	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The first picture snapped by a camera  
aboard the Mars Climate Orbiter shows the red planet from 2.8 
million miles away looking like a tiny, out-of-focus piece of elbow 
macaroni.

<P>
	The weather satellite is expected to reach Mars' orbit on Sept.  
23, about nine months after its launch. Its mission is to map the 
planet's surface and send back detailed information about the 
planet's climate over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	It follows the Mars Global Surveyor, which has been mapping the  
planet's surface since March and is scheduled to end its mission in 
2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Another probe is due to arrive in December to test the planet's  
soil and search for water.

interest. ``As the stock market goes, so do our fortunes,'' she 
says. ``It's really a seat of power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stand with her at the corner of Wall and Broad Streets, and feel  
the allure of Pure Capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve TV trucks wait daily outside the imposing marble  
building; more than 20 arrive when the news is really big. Visiting 
the NYSE was easy a few years ago. Now, tourists stand in lines 
that snake around the block. 
</P>
<P>
	First in line today are the Mallias, New Yorkers clutching the  
portfolio list of the grandsons who wait with them. They file into 
the gallery overlooking the trading floor. ``It's really 
wild-looking,'' says Ms. Mallia. Later, they wait three-deep at the 
gift counter to buy souvenir pens. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks attract more than America's tourists. Investors check and  
recheck their numbers, following every winner and loser. Some carry 
pagers that scroll the stock ticker. Others quit their jobs to 
hunker over computers and trade all day. 
</P>
<P>
	With the rise of do-it-yourself retirement plans, Americans from  
janitors to CEOs control their financial futures. And with four 
years of double-digit returns, they're putting their money in 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Caldwell, 33, a ``low-risk kind of guy,'' invests in mutual  
funds, hoping to earn a little something to leave his three 
children. He follows such specific sectors of the market as voice 
recognition technology. ``It's kind of a hobby,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Nowadays, like Caldwell, 43 percent of American households own  
stock, either directly or through mutual funds and pension 
accounts. Edward Wolff, an economist at New York University, charts 
the rise from nearly 25 percent in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	About 160 billion shares changed hands in 1997, up 27 percent  
from the previous yea -- on the NYSE, its main competitor Nasdaq, 
the smaller American Stock Exchange and five tiny regional 
exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	The bull market that preceded the 1929 crash also attracted many  
Americans. Books on investing and betting on stocks grew popular, 
says John Steele Gordon, historian and author of the upcoming book, 
``The Great Game: The Emergence of Wall Street as a World Power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, at no other time has the market touched as many Americans  
as today. The poorest 40 percent of U.S. households now invests an 
average of $1,600 in stocks, up from $300 (in today's dollars) in 
1962. Children are investing, too: Stein Roe's $1 billion Young 
Investor Fund has ballooned to 190,000 shareholders from 4,000 
since it was created five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter that the wealthiest 10 percent of Americans still  
dominate, owning 82 percent of the value of all stocks. The 
stampeding market has made it possible for all to dream. 
</P>
<P>
	Online brokerages, trying to wrest control from Wall Street's  
elite, feed investor hopes with catchy ads. ``Someone's going to 
win the Lottery. Just Not You,'' warns an ETrade magazine ad. ``We 
just think waiting for those magic numbers to hit might take a 
while. At ETrade, we're used to things moving faster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Discover Brokerage television ad, now nominated for an Emmy  
award, features a tow-truck driver boasting of his online-trading 
prowess. The punch line? He just bought an island. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some advertisements more closely resemble commercials for the  
lottery than anything else,'' scolds Securities and Exchange 
Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt. ``We ... should not get manic 
about the mania.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet new millionaires do fuel the excitement. The 401(k)  
millionaires who never expected their retirement funds to fatten to 
seven figures. The paper millionaires, those 20-something Internet 
upstarts who sell their companies' stock. The investor millionaires 
who caught Amazon.com's meteoric run-up to $221.25 in April, then 
got out before it halved. 
</P>
<P>
	But in order to win, investors need to learn. And nowadays,  
they're hungry for market lore. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 108 new business and finance magazines -- nearly triple  
those of the early 90s -- are now published. Nearly 7,500 Web sites 
are geared to investing. Amateur investment clubs abound, doubling 
to 37,000 since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Mets fans now absorb a half-hour of financial buzz at each home  
game. Three other ballparks may match the 30-foot-long electronic 
signs in Shea Stadium's outfield. 
</P>
<P>
	New York's Times Square, so recently a porn pit, flashes the  
country's newest fetish: big stock zippers. Nasdaq plans a 
14,000-square-foot sign at a reported cost of $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Each week, CNBC, a cable network entering adolescence, reaches 7  
million homes -- plus offices, restaurants, airports, prisons, 
college dorms, hospital rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Its reporters are unwitting celebrities. CNBC Anchor Sue Herera  
is shocked by the fame once reserved for rock stars. She's so 
besieged that she registers at hotels under her maiden name and 
asks her husband to pick up Chinese take-out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to get out of there with my food, and the cook's  
asking, 'What's with Intel?','' she recalls, laughing, over a lunch 
of roast salmon near the network's studios in Fort Lee, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in five cities, CNBC is televising its ``Power  
Lunch'' segment, attracting a crowd at each stop. Colleen Astles 
drove 30 miles from Woodstock, Ga., to Atlanta to see the filming. 
Each day, she checks her stocks via the Internet and catches three 
hours of CNBC. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm watching it right now!'' she says, from vacation in  
Sarasota. ``If you buy a car, it depreciates. You buy Microsoft, 
and for the most part, it goes up, if you're in it for the long 
run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The long run -- that's the mantra of stock market gurus. Buy,  
then hold on to it. But the hopeful get antsy. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get crazed. You see the numbers always,'' says Ms. Mallia,  
the grandmother visiting the NYSE. ``Our broker told us to turn off 
CNBC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The longer a person has an Internet trading account the more  
trades he makes, according to NFO Worldwide, a research group based 
in Greenwich, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	``People think if they're not active in the market, they're not  
doing the right thing. They feel they have to move,'' says Muriel 
Siebert, the Wall Street doyenne who in 1969 became the first woman 
to own a seat on the NYSE. She frets: ``It's been too easy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nonsense, argues Tracey Curvey, head of the online brokerage at  
Fidelity Investments. The explosion of financial information is 
creating smarter investors, and technology offers them the 
opportunity to control their futures, she says. ``It's really about 
convenience and control, not about obsession.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But for many, there is that thrill.  
</P>
<P>
	Zach Mader, a 20-year-old who studies the business of farming at  
the University of Nebraska at Kearney, believes there's money to be 
made in today's market, especially if you hold on. 
</P>
<P>
	Why, then, does he trade three, four, five times a week and  
follow 60 or 70 stocks each day? ``For the thrill,'' concedes 
Mader, who says his dad, a farmer, at first tried to discourage him 
from investing. ``It's kind of a gamble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mader is keeping his head, not letting investing eclipse his  
studies. But others aren't. Last winter, National Discount Brokers, 
of New York, linked its Web site to netaddiction.com, a group that 
helps trading addicts. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, uptown from the stock exchange, is Tradescape.com,  
an office strewn with soda cans, pizza boxes and coffee cups. 
There, day-traders, some of the market's most hard-core 
thrill-seekers, sit before computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6 million investors who trade online in their spare time far  
outnumber the estimated 5,000 day-traders nationwide. But both 
groups represent the extremes of market frenzy, propelling its 
success -- and notoriety. 
</P>
<P>
	Such day-traders are indelibly linked to Mark O. Barton, the  
day-trader with reported losses who killed 12 people in Atlanta, 
including nine at two trading firms. 
</P>
<P>
	At Tradescape, 180 traders, up from last year's 25, play the  
market's tiniest ups and downs. Jorge Linares, eyes glued to the 
screen and fingers tapping, buys 100 shares of Healtheon Corp., an 
Internet health care company, at $55.25. Seconds later, he sells at 
$55, losing a total of $25. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has the little rush, like the casino,'' says the  
23-year-old, who has a new bachelor's degree in economics and art 
history. He watches as the stock falls to $53.37 1/2 and is jubilant 
that he didn't lose more. 
</P>
<P>
	This morning, he's already lost $3,000. ``I wouldn't want to do  
this when I'm 30, with a family and a wife,'' he says, typing 
constantly. ``When you're fresh out of school, you can take the 
most risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Claaang! The bell sounds. The market closes.  
</P>
<P>
	On this day, Jim Caldwell saw Apple Computer rise $1.56 1/4 to  
$60.75. Colleen Astles tracked Home Depot, up $1.43 3/4 to $64.25. At 
the exchange, Linda Mallia watched Lucent Technologies as it rose 
$1.62 1/2 to $65.25. 
</P>
<P>
	Hey, tomorrow's another trading day.

<HEADLINE> Gypsies Target of Discrimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAJDUHADHAZ, Hungary (AP) -- The squad car screeched to a stop,  
and two cops jumped out. Then a club slammed into the 15-year-old's 
head, the start of a beating that led to emergency surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Far off in Ostrava, Czech Republic, another young victim of an  
unprovoked beating had her wrist and several fingers broken by 
classmates. 
</P>
<P>
	The common thread is both victims are Gypsies, or Roma as they  
call themselves, the eastern Europe subculture of people who don't 
fit in -- and suffer for it. 
</P>
<P>
	The widest publicized cases of anti-Roma sentiment have recently  
come from Kosovo, where the international media have provided 
extensive coverage of Roma being killed, beaten or expelled by 
ethnic Albanians in revenge for their alleged support of Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	But getting even -- for whatever excuse -- is not restricted to  
Kosovo. All across eastern Europe, away from the spotlight, Roma 
are targets -- of skinhead lynchings, police beatings, even official 
disdain, such as in the Czech town of Usti nad Labem, where a wall 
is going up to separate a Gypsy community from other residents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Roma persecution in Kosovo is in many ways similar to what  
East Europe's Roma elsewhere suffer every day,'' says Claude Cahn 
of the European Roma Rights Center. ``The difference is that there 
is little attention to what goes on outside Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Hajduhadhaz, 15-year-old Attila Rezes says the officers who  
beat him in April during a search for a break-in suspect ``called 
my mother a Gypsy whore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Ostrava, Helena Cermakova says that when she complained to  
the school principal about her daughter's beating earlier this 
year, he replied: ``She should not be so provocative and wear such 
short skirts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both towns seem ordinary places. But scratch the surface and  
Gypsy woes come bubbling up. 
</P>
<P>
	Hajduhadhaz's Roma prostitutes, some as young as 16, complain of  
unprovoked police beatings while doing business from hovels on the 
edge of town -- something police deny. Younger Roma kids are still 
afraid a year after an emotionally disturbed, non-Gypsy teacher 
attacked them with a knife. 
</P>
<P>
	In Ostrava, some Roma children report being abused by non-Gypsy  
classmates or teachers. Others are sent to schools for the 
handicapped, even if they are not disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	Not counting victims in Kosovo, 30 Roma have been killed in  
race-related violence in eastern Europe since the end of communism, 
according to Cahn's monitoring group. 
</P>
<P>
	The deaths are a continuation of hate crimes as old as the fifth  
century, when the ancestors of what now are an estimated 10 million 
European Gypsies started arriving, apparently from India. Hatred 
peaked during the Nazi Holocaust, during which a half million were 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Governments, as well as the United Nations, have sought to  
improve the image of the Roma, which means ``The People'' in their 
language. 
</P>
<P>
	But old stereotypes remain. The darker-skinned Roma often are  
viewed as thieves, cutthroats and cheats by others. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Roma do avoid work, but much of that lies in discrimination  
and the failures of the past communist system. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of promoting education and equal opportunity, Marxist  
governments kept Roma on society's lower rungs by enticing them to 
do menial labor for relatively high wages. Now, most can make more 
money from unemployment and welfare. Others with no chance of work 
turn to crime to survive. 
</P>
<P>
	Past inequalities are perpetuated in the post-communist era,  
with many bright Roma kids coerced into going to schools for the 
handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
	Roma are 15 times more likely to end up in such schools in the  
Czech Republic, the Roma Rights Center says. The situation is 
similar in other eastern European countries. 
</P>
<P>
	After time in such schools, Roma children who tested at IQs of  
up to 120 perform at levels of children with IQs as low as 70 to 
90, according to a report by the Roma rights organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Pavel Kuchajr, a former teacher at a special school in Ostrava,  
says that while non-Roma at his school had disabilities, ``in my 
opinion the Romani pupils were not mentally deficient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The kids arrive at school already disadvantaged. The average  
Roma newborn in Hungary weighs just over five pounds, about two 
pounds less than the average non-Gypsy infant, U.N. statistics 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	Roma school dropout rates are up to 30 times higher than those  
of non-Roma. 
</P>
<P>
	Some never live to reach school, like the 6-year-old boy in  
Hajduhadhaz who died in 1997 after becoming ill from eating an 
abandoned pig carcass. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clear to us that a number of them regularly eat  
carrion,'' says Balint Bernath, the local Roma rights 
representative. ``You cannot prevent hungry Roma from doing that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bernath, a lawyer, says he used to be on speaking terms with  
non-Roma residents of Hajduhadhaz. But that changed this spring, 
when hundreds demonstrated to support the two police officers 
accused of beating Rezes. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said things to me like 'Stinking Gypsy' and 'Go to  
Auschwitz,''' says Bernath. ``Before that, Hungarians and Gypsies 
here used to talk with each other. No more.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Set To Vote on Oil Royalties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Big oil companies see it as an ill-timed tax  
on a struggling industry. Their critics say it's about greedy 
corporations ripping off the taxpayer. 
</P>
<P>
	Billions of dollars are at stake for both sides as the Senate  
votes today on a measure to block the Interior Department from 
revamping the way it collects fees for the millions of barrels of 
oil taken each year from federal land and offshore. 
</P>
<P>
	If the oil industry is successful, the new fee collection policy  
would be set back another year and, according to department 
estimates, the government would be shortchanged another $68 million 
for its oil. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is whether oil companies are paying enough for oil  
taken from federal land. 
</P>
<P>
	About $1.2 billion a year is collected by the Interior  
Department from the 12.5 percent royalty fee. Critics contend that 
for decades oil companies have reduced the amount of money paid to 
the government by using artificially low values for the oil at the 
wellhead. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big oil companies ... are cheating the taxpayers,'' says  
Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who threatened to block the Interior 
Department's spending bill with a filibuster over the oil royalty 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The Interior Department wants to change its rules so that oil's  
value can be pegged to actual market indicators and thus be more 
representative of oil's market value. 
</P>
<P>
	The change, says Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, would bring  
in an additional $5.56 million a month in royalty payments, most of 
it from a dozen of the country's biggest oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators are scheduled to vote late today on whether to cut off  
debate on the matter. If 60 senators agree, oil industry supporters 
are likely to have enough votes to block the department's rule 
change for another year. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the oil industry say the royalty rules are too  
complex and that the changes will complicate matters further. They 
argue the proposed change is tantamount to a new tax on an industry 
already reeling from economic hard times. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of us don't want to see the American industry taxed any  
more than is absolutely reasonable and fair,'' says Sen. Pete 
Domenici, R-N.M., a co-sponsor of the proposal to block the new 
calculations. ``These regulations are not right, not fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Interior Department wants ``to second guess the sale of oil  
at the wellhead and make fuzzy exactly when the oil should be 
valued,'' says Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, who has led the 
Senate fight against the Interior proposal. She says only Congress 
can impose a new tax. 
</P>
<P>
	But critics argue the fee is payment to take the country's oil  
and not a tax, and that the companies are the ones that have used 
fuzzy calculations to undervalue the product, leading to the loss 
of billions of dollars to the federal government as well as to 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	``What Interior is trying to do is make it harder for the  
companies to cheat,'' said Danielle Brian, executive director of 
Project on Government Oversight, a Washington-based advocacy group 
and an early plaintiff in a federal lawsuit against oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit, being heard in Texas, seeks more than $2 billion in  
past underpayments. Separately over the years, six states already 
have collected nearly $800 million in settlements arising from 
undervaluation of oil taken from state lands. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of companies have moved to settle the Texas case,  
including Mobile, which agreed to pay $45 million, and Occidental, 
for $7.3 million.

<HEADLINE> Yanks Reach 3 Million in Attendance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Yankees reached the 3 million mark  
in home attendance for the first time in franchise history Sunday, 
breaking the barrier with a sellout crowd against Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The AL East leaders drew 56,028 to see Boston at Yankee Stadium,  
giving them a season total of 3,016,505 with seven home dates left. 
</P>
<P>
	``Drawing 3 million fans for the first time in the long history  
of the Yankees is a remarkable achievement,'' owner George 
Steinbrenner said in a statement. ``It really shows that Yankee 
fans are the greatest in the world and the entire Yankee 
organization thanks them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, Steinbrenner used the fact the Yankees had  
never attracted 3 million as an argument that the club might need 
to move from Yankee Stadium. Public debate on the issue has quieted 
in recent months and no decision from Steinbrenner seems imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	New York has averaged 40,764 per home game a year after winning  
the World Series. A day earlier, the team broke its attendance 
record of 2,951,467 set last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees and Baltimore, which increased its total to  
3,032,116 on Sunday, are the only teams in the majors over 3 
million in home attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to playing Boston, the Yankees honored Declan Lowney, 9,  
of Nanuet, N.Y., as their ceremonial 3 millionth fan. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowney was presented with an oversized ticket by pitcher David  
Cone and given other souvenirs. The boy also threw out the first 
ball after shaking hands with Yankees starter Roger Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
	In the middle of the eighth inning of a 4-1 loss, Yankees  
manager Joe Torre delivered a taped message on the scoreboard and 
said, ``On behalf of the New York Yankees, we want to thank you for 
your attendance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens was sorry the Yankees did not do better on the big day.  
</P>
<P>
	``You want to put on a good show for the fans,'' he said. ``I'm  
just sorry they didn't see us win.''

<HEADLINE> Bell Atlantic, Vodafone Near Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bell Atlantic Corp. acknowleged it is in talks  
with Vodafone AirTouch PLC to combine their U.S. wireless phone 
operations to form a fierce competitor to rivals Sprint Corp. and 
AT&AMP;T Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	A deal could be signed as early as this week, according to a  
person familiar with the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic said in a statement Sunday that it was in  
discussions with Vodafone AirTouch ``regarding the possibility of a 
U.S. business relationship.'' Vodafone, the world's largest 
cellular phone company, confirmed the talks nearly a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since so much is being written, at this point, we felt it  
would only be fair to at least acknowledge we're in talks,'' said 
Susan Kraus, a spokeswoman for New York-based Bell Atlantic, the 
nation's largest local telephone company. 
</P>
<P>
	Kraus said the company would have no further comment until a  
definitive agreement was reached or talks have ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Should a deal be reached, Bell Atlantic, which was trumped by  
Vodafone earlier this year in a bidding war over AirTouch 
Communications, would effectively get what it was after: AirTouch's 
West Coast cellular network. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal being discussed would combine Bell Atlantic's East  
Coast operations with Vodafone AirTouch's business in the 
southwestern U.S. to create a separate company with a nationwide 
mobile-phone network that could pose a stiff challenge to U.S. 
competitors Sprint Corp. and AT&AMP;T Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The combination could lead to lower wireless phone service fees,  
because customers would have a nationwide network and thereby avoid 
roaming or other extra charges for connecting outside their 
carrier's network. 
</P>
<P>
	Meetings in New York between negotiators from both companies  
continued Sunday, and the deal could still fall through. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts have said issues of control and hard feelings over the  
AirTouch battle could be stumbling blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Vodafone AirTouch is still considering other options to expand  
its U.S. wireless operations. Among them: acquiring another carrier 
such as Omnipoint Corp. or buying licenses from other carriers such 
as Nextwave Telecom Inc., which is currently under bankruptcy court 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike Bell Atlantic's network, Bethesda, Md.-based  
Omnipoint's technology is incompatible with Vodafone AirTouch's and 
an alliance with Bell Atlantic is the company's first choice, said 
the person close to the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Vodafone declined comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic, meanwhile, is working out details in a proposed  
$65 billion combination with GTE Corp. The merger is expected to be 
completed later this year.

<HEADLINE> New IBM Computer Raises Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- IBM is selling a powerful new business computer  
that fills an important gap in its product line and steps up 
pressure on rival sellers of machines that use the Unix operating 
system, a competitor to Microsoft's Windows program. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM's move is a counterpoint to a recent flurry of publicity for  
Sun Microsystems Inc.'s popular line of Unix computers. 
Hewlett-Packard Corp. also is a major maker of Unix computers.

	IBM plans to unveil its new S80 computer on Monday, which it  
says outperforms rivals' comparable products, able to handle more 
than 40,000 computing operations a second. The new model in IBM's 
RS 6000 line costs $290,000 and uses up to 24 microprocessors made 
with copper, which performs better than the traditional aluminum 
used in chips. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM, also a maker of computer chips, was the first major company  
to switch to copper. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM officials said the new Unix machine is aimed at helping  
businesses handle heavy-duty corporate tasks, such as running Web 
sites, managing networks of desktop computers and processing 
millions of transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is clearly a gap we've had in our product line,'' said  
Rod Adkins, general manager for IBM's RS 6000 unit. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM's announcement comes after Sun took the spotlight last week  
by unveiling a bare-bones machine that never needs a software 
upgrade and is far simpler than conventional desktop computers. 
Customers need to buy a powerful Sun computer in order to run a 
network of the simple machines. 
</P>
<P>
	A week earlier, Sun said it bought a small maker of office  
productivity programs and intends to distribute the applications 
for free over the Internet, to anyone with a Web browser. That way, 
users don't have to load bulky and expensive programs directly onto 
their computer desktop.

<HEADLINE> New ABC Set a Shot in Morning Wars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- From behind the flashing lights and custom-made  
windows of a new studio jutting 20 feet into Times Square, ``Good 
Morning America'' anchors Charles Gibson and Diane Sawyer can see 
just what they're up against. 
</P>
<P>
	A giant Astrovision screen a block in front of them beams their  
competition: NBC's top-rated ``Today'' show. 
</P>
<P>
	Over Gibson's right shoulder, a viewer can spot the Viacom  
building where, theoretically, the company that just bought CBS can 
hang a banner advertising the Tiffany network's soon-to-premiere 
``Early Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They wouldn't think of it, would they?'' Gibson asked with a  
smile. 
</P>
<P>
	Better believe it, Charlie. This is war. Monday's debut of ABC's  
glitzy studio is the latest evidence of how morning news shows have 
become network television's lucrative new battleground. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the place to be,'' said CBS's Jane Clayson. ``The  
competition is fierce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CBS last week chose Clayson, a former ABC News correspondent, to  
be Bryant Gumbel's new partner in the morning. Gumbel, the former 
``Today'' host, was lured back to morning TV after CBS promised to 
spend up to $30 million to build its own storefront studio 
overlooking New York's Central Park. The ``Early Show'' bows on 
Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	It is CBS's boldest effort yet to end its perpetual doormat  
status in the morning. The immediate target is ``Good Morning 
America,'' still within striking distance despite ending a long 
slide in the ratings when Sawyer and Gibson were brought in. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's new studio, complete with a 32-foot-high outdoor jumbo TV  
screen and a replica of a New York City subway station, is evidence 
it won't back down. ABC isn't saying how much was spent on the 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
	The success of ``Today'' explains all the activity. NBC has  
taken advantage of Americans' tendency to get up earlier, and turn 
on the TV when they do. The show's audience increased for four 
straight years before holding steady this year. 
</P>
<P>
	That's no mean feat in an era when TV viewership is declining.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's exhilarating to see that the only growth area in network  
television is in the mornings now,'' said Phyllis McGrady, the ABC 
executive who oversees ``Good Morning America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With networks scrambling to stay even, ``Today'' cleared $100  
million in profits for NBC last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been very fortunate,'' said Jeff Zucker, executive  
producer of ``Today.'' ``We've been on top for five years and it's 
a great position to be in. But it's also tough, because you have to 
deliver day after day. It would be easy to get complacent. But the 
competition won't allow it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The high stakes have brought a willingness to spend money, but  
also a certain conservatism. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon, NBC, ABC and CBS will all have morning news shows with  
Manhattan studios where passersby can peer in and wave at the 
cameras (the cable Fox News Channel makes it four). Each will have 
male and female co-hosts, with a black man reporting the weather. 
Each will offer a mix of news and features. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Heyward, CBS News president, said morning viewers want an  
update on what happened overnight, personalities they can feel 
comfortable with and information useful to their lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``You fail to do any of these things at your own peril,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The networks all have individual challenges. Clayson is  
unproven, and CBS hopes the love-hate relationship many viewers 
have with Gumbel veers toward the former. ABC hasn't established 
replacements for Gibson and Sawyer, who both say they're working 
temporarily in the morning. NBC has to guard against becoming smug 
with success. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are the ones that will continue to push the envelope,''  
Zucker said. ``It's just that ABC and CBS are trying to have what 
we had five years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's not afraid to tweak the competition. The Times Square  
Astrovision used to air stock reports and other fare in the morning 
before Zucker made a phone call. And -- voila! -- starting Monday 
``Today'' will be shown where his friends from ``GMA'' can see it. 
</P>
<P>
	Why the change?  
</P>
<P>
	``Because we can,'' Zucker said.

<HEADLINE> Frasier Dog Has Natural Talent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Moose, the dog who plays Eddie on ``Frasier''  
couldn't get into acting until he learned some professionalism. 
</P>
<P>
	``I adopted Moose in '93 when he was 3 years old,''  
owner-trainer Mathilde de Cagny says in Sunday's New York Post. 
``And he'd already had a couple of owners before me who gave him 
away, because he was misbehaving: chewing, barking, digging, 
running away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Cagny saw potential in the Jack Russell terrier now beloved  
by TV fans for constantly upstaging the neurotic Frasier. 
</P>
<P>
	The veteran trainer knows canine acting talent when she sees it.  
Cagny also owns Jill, the scene-stealing Brussels Griffon in ``As 
Good As It Gets,'' and Clovis, the golden retriever who played 
Shadow in the film, ``Homeward Bound.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And for Moose, there's only one real director.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're like an old married couple,'' Cagny said. ``I'm 10 feet  
away from him at all times, and there's a lot of silent 
communication between us, with hand signals and eye contact that 
only the live (studio) audience can see.''

<HEADLINE> LA Hopefuls To Meet Again With NFL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- With the clock ticking down, Los Angeles  
continues to try to pull off an upset and win an NFL expansion 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Three LA groups and one from Houston will make their pitches  
again in separate meetings with league officials Monday in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL had given Los Angeles six months to come up with a  
suitable proposal for a stadium. That time runs out Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the groups from the Los Angeles area -- representing the  
Coliseum, Hollywood Park and Carson -- apparently are anywhere near 
finalizing plans for a stadium because none has been given firm 
guidelines by the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston does have a solid proposal for a stadium, including $195  
million in public funds. 
</P>
<P>
	A franchise fee still will have to be negotiated. The NFL's  
Wednesday deadline doesn't mean anything firm will be decided then. 
The league instead is expected to entertain offers from both 
Houston and LA for several more weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Closing the door entirely on Los Angeles would give the NFL  
considerably less leverage in any negotiations with Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL expansion committee is scheduled to meet Oct. 5 in  
Atlanta, a day before the league's 31 team owners convene. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said he hopes a decision will be  
made then. Ed Roski, who backs the Coliseum, initially thought the 
decision process might drag on, but now he says, ``It looks like 
they're going to do something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roski is scheduled to be among the Coliseum representatives at  
Monday's meetings with Tagliabue and other league officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Ovitz, who backed Carson early then switched his support  
to the Coliseum, also is expected to attend. The NFL team owners 
have always seemed interested in Ovitz, a Hollywood dealmaker, as a 
potential team owner because of his ties to the entertainment 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	A representative for Marvin Davis, who has approached the league  
about a site at Hollywood Park, also is expected to meet with 
league officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston will be represented by Bob McNair, who put together that  
city's package and has waited while the league tried to work out a 
deal in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Houston is awarded the expansion franchise, NFL  
officials have said they still will work to put a team in the Los 
Angeles area, which has been without a team since the Raiders left 
the Coliseum and the Rams left Anaheim, both after the 1994 season.

<HEADLINE> Saints' Williams Hurt in 1st Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Ricky Williams' NFL debut was interrupted  
Sunday when his injured left ankle sent him to the sidelines and 
then to the locker room before halftime of the New Orleans Saints 
game against the Carolina Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who had eight carries for 37 yards in the first  
quarter, ran for 7 yards around the left end, then for 8 yards up 
the middle to close out the quarter. His 8-yard run gave New 
Orleans its only first down of the period, but sent Williams 
hopping off the field, favoring his injured left ankle. He was 
helped to the bench and his ankle retaped as worried coach Mike 
Ditka looked on. 
</P>
<P>
	The team announced that Williams again had a high ankle sprain  
and was questionable to return. But Williams took a couple of 
practice runs on the sideline, then drew a standing ovation as he 
trotted back into the lineup. He made only two more carries, 
however, the first for no gain, the second for 3 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams again started limping and was called off the field by  
the Saints trainer. After huddling with the trainer and team 
doctors, Williams was placed in a cart and taken to the locker room 
for X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams sustained a high sprain of his left ankle in the first  
preseason game but was cleared to play and returned this week.

<HEADLINE> IMF Finds Signs of Global Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The global economy finally is showing signs of  
an upturn after struggling for more than two years with a virulent 
financial crisis, the International Monetary Fund said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 182-nation lending organization said in its annual report  
that threats of economic troubles spreading have lessened 
considerably since last fall, when the collapse of the Russian 
ruble was felt around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year the worst of the crisis seems well behind us,'' said  
the IMF's deputy managing director, Stanley Fischer. ``Most of the 
Asian crisis countries are recovering fast. ... Brazil's 
IMF-supported adjustment program is succeeding, and growth has been 
more rapid than expected. And the Russian economy too is doing 
better than expected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF used the report to defend its handling of the currency  
crisis. In August 1998, it looked as if the crisis could drag down 
economies in the United States and elsewhere after Russia's botched 
ruble devaluation rocked financial markets from New York to Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency had assembled billions of dollars in rescue loans but  
appeared powerless to halt the spread of currency troubles that 
began in Thailand in July 1997. IMF critics also complained of 
excessive secrecy and a one-size-fits-all mentality toward economic 
recovery programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with improvements in the overall economy, the IMF has been  
embarrassed again in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia, the recipient of more IMF assistance than any other  
nation, is alleged to be involved in financial corruption, 
including bribery and massive money laundering through a New York 
bank. On Friday, the IMF announced it was suspending a $12 billion 
Indonesian loan program, citing a banking scandal and the 
government's conduct in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	Also last week, the Netherlands government leaked a memo  
indicating that opposition from members of Congress representing 
gold-mining states had brought the IMF close to abandoning efforts 
to sell gold directly to the public. The sales would finance debt 
relief for poor countries. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF officials insisted they were near agreement on a deal to use  
gold but avoid direct sales to the public, which the mining 
industry feared would depress already weak gold prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF annual report said it has acted numerous times in the  
past year to reduce secrecy surrounding its deliberations and force 
member countries to provide investors with more timely and accurate 
information about economic conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, the agency began seeking permission of  
member countries to post on the IMF's World Wide Web site results 
of annual IMF reviews of individual countries' economic 
performances. The IMF also began publishing the exact economic 
reforms that countries agree to implement in exchange for loans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have come a very long way on transparency in just a few  
years,'' Fischer told reporters at a briefing on the annual report. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF said it had made less progress in restructuring the  
global financial system to reduce the likelihood of future crises. 
Still, the agency said nations were moving ahead with proposals to 
adopt standards of good conduct in banking and other areas. 
</P>
<P>
	It conceded a lack of agreement on ways to ensure that IMF  
rescue loans not be used to bail out private investors who made 
risky bets in emerging markets. 
</P>
<P>
	In one way, the IMF, which is having its annual meeting this  
month, is in far better shape financially to deal with the next 
crisis: Its members approved an increase in resources, which the 
report said stood at $76.6 billion in uncommitted reserves on April 
30. That is more than double the level of a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	But outstanding loans to troubled countries are up, to a record  
$90.8 billion at the end of April, or 20 percent higher than 12 
months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration won approval after a long struggle  
for an increase of $18 billion in U.S. support to the IMF. But 
Congress imposed numerous conditions aimed at pushing the agency to 
move more quickly toward changes in its operations.

<HEADLINE> Sound System Premieres at NYC Opera </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It turned out the sound was no cause for fury.  
</P>
<P>
	After weeks of negative publicity over news that the New York  
City Opera had installed an ``acoustical enhancement system,'' the 
fall season opened Saturday night with the emphasis just where it 
belonged -- on Mark Lamos' stunning abstract production of Puccini's 
``Madama Butterfly'' and a lovely performance by soprano Oksana 
Krovytska in the title role. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, at first hearing, the new sound system provided only  
the subtlest of changes. Singers who used to be hard to hear from 
rear stage still tended to sound muffled. 
</P>
<P>
	As Pinkerton, tenor Rafael Rojas was occasionally lost amid the  
heavy orchestration, though in Act 3 his voice took on a certain 
brightness, more metallic than warm. Krovytska's sweet soprano 
projected well without sounding forced, but it was hard to tell how 
the ``enhancement'' made a difference in her performance, which was 
well-received last season, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that the controversy is likely to fade anytime soon. To many  
opera lovers -- for whom the slightest nuance of a favorite singer's 
voice is a subject for avid discussion -- the mere idea of 
electronic tinkering with natural sound is abhorrent. To them, it 
reduces opera to the equivalent of amplified rock concerts and 
over-miked Broadway musicals. 
</P>
<P>
	City Opera insists it is not amplifying anything. The company  
says it has only ``altered sound reverberation patterns'' by 
installing two dozen microphones around the stage and connecting 
them to 144 speakers hidden in walls and under balconies throughout 
the 2,700-seat State Theater. 
</P>
<P>
	Few would deny something needed to be done about the acoustics.  
The State Theater was built with the New York City Ballet mainly in 
mind, and that meant deadening sounds on stage as much as possible 
so the audience wouldn't pick up a dancer's every footfall. The 
City Opera had use of the auditorium but little say in the design. 
</P>
<P>
	For years critics and audiences have complained that the  
promising young singers for whom City Opera is a natural home have 
had to strain their voices to make themselves heard. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Kellogg, the company's director, promises the new system is  
an experiment that will be removed if it is deemed a failure. And 
everyone agrees the long-term solution is a multimillion-dollar 
remodeling or a move to a different theater entirely. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, more performances like Saturday's ``Butterfly''  
should help reduce the roar of the debate. 
</P>
<P>
	In the production, which premiered last season, Lamos and set  
designer Michael Yeargan have stripped the cobwebs away from this 
staple of the repertory. Gone is the standard honeymoon house, the 
garden with its cherry trees. Instead we get a few sliding screens, 
a staircase, some model ships hanging from the ceiling in Act 1, 
and gorgeous lighting effects -- blue sky and fluffy clouds, giving 
way to angry red for the Bonze's interruption and then to pink for 
the love duet. 
</P>
<P>
	The orchestra played well for the most part under Joseph  
Rescigno's baton, though there were a few sour notes and an 
occasional tendency to play too loud.

	Indonesia OKs East Timor Peacekeepers  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie said  
today he would allow a U.N. peacekeeping force into East Timor to 
help contain the violence there. In a national television address, 
Habibie said he wanted to end the crisis in the former Portuguese 
colony. For more than a week, impoverished East Timor has been 
engulfed in a wave of violence, intimidation and deportations by 
Indonesian troops and pro-Indonesian militias. ``It's a nice, big 
step in the right direction,'' U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said. 
Habibie is due to hold talks with a five-member ambassadorial team 
from the U.N. Security Council Sunday night.

<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- President Clinton today welcomed  
the decision by Indonesian President B.J. Habibie to invite an 
international peacekeeping force to help restore order in East 
Timor, his national security adviser said. ``This is a very 
positive development, and represents a stepping back from the brink 
for Indonesia,'' Sandy Berger said, shortly after Habibie's 
annoncement. ``What's important now is that the discussions proceed 
very expeditiously in the United Nations so we can promptly see a 
U.N. force deployed that will restore order and effectuate the 
results of the referendum of the people of East Timor,'' Berger 
said.

	Hurricane Moves Toward Bahamas  
</P>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Hurricane Floyd grew to a major storm  
packing 115 mph winds today as it churned toward the Bahamas and 
prompted flood warnings in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. 
Officials posted a hurricane watch for the central Bahamas and 
tropical storm warnings for the southeastern Bahamas and Britain's 
Turks and Caicos islands. Meteorologists say the storm was unlikely 
to hit land soon and poses no immediate threat to the United 
States. At 8 a.m. EDT, Floyd was about 365 miles east of Grand Turk 
island -- just east of the Bahamas chain. It was traveling west 
about 12 mph.

Chinese trade minister Shi Guangsheng held two hours of talks, four 
months after China broke off the negotiations after U.S. planes 
bombed Beijing's embassy in Belgrade during the NATO air campaign

	Lockerbie Notes Reportedly Destroyed

<P>
	EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) -- Dozens of police notebooks that may  
have included vital evidence against two Libyans charged with the 
1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 have been destroyed, a Scottish 
newspaper reported today. Scotland on Sunday, quoting unidentified 
legal sources, said the police notebooks were destroyed five years 
after the jumbo jet was blown up over the Scottish village of 
Lockerbie, killing 270 people. The books included notes made by 
officers during the painstaking collection of fragments from the 
wreckage. Two Libyan agents are due to stand trial before Scottish 
judges sitting at a special court in The Netherlands in February.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Andre Agassi will face off later today against  
Todd Martin in an All-American final of the U.S. Open tennis 
tournament. Agassi, winner of the French Open and runner-up at 
Wimbledon this summer, regained the No. 1 ranking yesterday as he 
advanced to the title match against Martin, the new No. 4 after a 
6-4, 6-1, 6-2 romp over Cedric Pioline. The all American final will 
be only the fifth here in the Open era, which began in 1968, and 
the first since Pete Sampras beat Michael Chang in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Myths About Antibacterial Soaps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HIGH POINT, N.C. (AP) -- Popular antibacterial hand soaps provide  
extra protection against nasty germs like staph, E. coli and 
salmonella, but they aren't new, they don't sterilize hands and 
they aren't approved by the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, consumers have made antibacterials a big business.  
Last year, retailers sold about $400 million worth of antibacterial 
hand soap. 
</P>
<P>
	Half the dish soaps on grocery shelves bear antibacterial  
labels. Antibacterial agents also are used in toothpaste as well as 
in cleaners for fabrics, rugs, kitchen counters and toilet bowls. 
</P>
<P>
	For all that, many experts say thorough handwashing with regular  
soap is still the best way to clean hands and prevent the spread of 
disease. Moreover, some are concerned that antibacterials might 
lead to development of bacteria-resistant strains. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's important is washing your hands,'' said William  
Schaffner, chairman of the department of preventive medicine at 
Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. ``What's less important 
is what you use.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Purported germ-killing soaps have been on the market since the  
1920s, according to the Soap and Detergent Association. Hospitals 
have used germ-killing scrubs for many years. 
</P>
<P>
	Only in recent years has the term ``antibacterial'' become a  
buzzword in the soap products industry, said Keith Hostetler, vice 
president of Ciba Specialty Chemicals' antibacterial products 
division in High Point. 
</P>
<P>
	Swiss-based Ciba makes Triclosan, a bacteria-killer and -growth  
inhibitor created in 1965 and found in antibacterial soaps sold by 
companies such as Dial, Colgate-Palmolive and Bath and Body Works. 
Ciba first used Triclosan in laundry detergent to fight 
odor-causing bacteria, Hostetler said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1970s saw the advent of germ-killing soaps like Irish Spring  
and Life Buoy, but most did not bear an antibacterial label. 
</P>
<P>
	Liquid Dial, with an antibacterial formulation and label, was  
introduced in 1986, said Dial spokeswoman Nancy Stern. It was the 
first liquid antibacterial soap. 
</P>
<P>
	Dial began stamping its bar soap with antibacterial labels in  
the early 1990s without changing the makeup of the soap, which had 
been around since 1972, according to Janet Donohue, a spokeswoman 
at the Soap and Detergent Association. That practice is acceptable 
so long as companies reapply with the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Other companies began introducing antibacterial soap three to  
four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Antibacterial products are catching on because people travel  
more and use public transportation, more children go to day-care 
centers, and hospital patients are being released more quickly, 
Donohue said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the public likes it. I personally like the  
antibacterial soap. Why would I take the risk if I have the option 
(of using antibacterial soap),'' said Barbara Jorgensen, a 
spokeswoman at Bath and Body Works. Owned by The Limited, the store 
introduced antibacterial hand soap in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	While antibacterial product-makers acknowledge regular soap  
works, too -- by washing away germs -- they say their products kill 
the germs and stop bacteria growth for as long as six hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Hostetler said Triclosan adds staying power to soap, which is  
important because most people either don't wash their hands at all 
or enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a convenience, an extra level of protection,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In a test at Ciba that shows the long-lasting effect of the  
product, a volunteer washed her hands with liquid soap and then 
placed her fingers in a petri dish teeming with staph bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	She returned to the lab two, four and six hours later to repeat  
the test without washing her hands. When the petri dishes were 
examined 24 hours later, researchers found the bacteria was killed 
in the areas touched by the volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts, however, say it is impossible to kill all the germs on  
hands. 
</P>
<P>
	While Triclosan slows bacterial growth, bacteria always grows  
back, said Ralph Raasch, associate professor in the school of 
pharmacy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	``The skin has lots of bacteria on it. It's very difficult ...  
to totally destroy the population with any chemical,'' Raasch said. 
</P>
<P>
	A study last year by Tufts University showed antibacterial  
agents and antibiotics might even cause bacteria to become 
resistant. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the  
American Medical Association do not support or criticize use of 
antibacterial soaps, but favor a good handwashing with regular soap 
and water to prevent the spread of disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Antibacterial soaps fall into a gray regulatory area. The FDA  
hasn't weighed in yet with standards and approvals pending further 
study. Hostetler said antibacterial manufacturers tend to follow 
standards last proposed by the FDA in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	While conceding antibacterials do not sterilize the skin,  
Hostetler says they control bacterial growth. ``Less bacteria is 
better than more bacteria.''

<HEADLINE> Cocaine-Heart Attack Link Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Cocaine use can promote blood clotting, which may  
explain how the drug triggers heart attacks in its users, according 
to a new study. 
</P>
<P>
	Cocaine caused blood to thicken by increasing the number of red  
blood cells, and by triggering an increase in a protein that causes 
platelets to stick together, said Dr. Arthur Siegel, the study's 
lead author. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``double whammy'' can cause clotting that can lead to heart  
attacks and strokes, said Siegel, chief of internal medicine at 
McLean Hospital outside Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Cocaine use) is even more dangerous than we had previously  
known,'' he said. ``Every time a person uses it, it's like a little 
bit of Russian roulette.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A previous study, released in June, showed that cocaine users  
are 24 times more likely to have a heart attack during the first 
hour after taking the drug. The new study, which appears in 
Monday's issue of the Archives of Internal Medicine, may help 
explain why such heart attacks occur, Siegel said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study suggests that anticoagulants may be useful in treating  
cocaine-induced chest pains, Siegel said. And he said it provides 
further warning to athletes who might use cocaine or substances 
with a similar affect in an attempt to enhance performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Siegel acknowledged that the study's small sample size made the  
conclusions preliminary, and he suggested further study. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very confident that both of these observations are  
real,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study measured changes in the blood in 21 people before and  
for 60 minutes after they sniffed a moderate amount of cocaine or 
received it intravenously. Red blood cell counts on average 
increased 4 percent to 6 percent after individuals ingested the 
drug, due to constriction of the spleen. Cocaine use causes the 
spleen to constrict, pumping more red blood cells into the system, 
Siegel said. 
</P>
<P>
	The thickened blood must circulate through already-constricted  
vessels, creating a potentially dangerous situation, Siegel said. 
Previous studies have shown that cocaine use causes blood vessels 
to narrow. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also found an average 40 percent increase in a blood  
protein known as the von Willebrand factor in subjects who received 
cocaine intravenously. The von Willebrand factor promotes clotting 
by causing platelets to stick together. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Steve Frohwein, a cardiologist and assistant professor at  
the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta said several 
factors -- such as infection, cancer or other toxins -- can lead to 
clotting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cocaine just stimulates a well known cascade of events,'' said  
Frohwein, who was not involved in the study.

<HEADLINE> Bening Returns to Theater </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For theater-trained actress Annette Bening,  
performing is all about adapting. 
</P>
<P>
	After years doing theater productions in San Francisco and New  
York, Bening suddenly found herself in front of a movie camera. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I first started doing movies, it struck me as so bizarre  
that you would be acting for two minutes at a time -- just walk 
through a door and scream, whatever those little moments were,'' 
Bening says in Sunday's Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because I came from that other perspective where you're doing  
45 minutes of acting. I didn't understand it. I thought I was going 
to be too big and too loud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After posting film credits including ``The Grifters,'' ``Mars  
Attacks!'' ``Postcards from the Edge,'' ``Bugsy'' and ``The 
Siege,'' Bening returned to theater work, doing eight performances 
each week of ``Hedda Gabler'' in a Los Angeles production. 
</P>
<P>
	``Slowly over the last 10 years I've evolved into a film  
actress, so when I was rehearsing the play I realized I'd forgotten 
what it was like,'' Bening said. ``It struck me on day in rehearsal 
-- I was about halfway through the play and I just thought: `I can't 
concentrate anymore. Why does this go on so long?' Just emotionally 
to stay concentrated for that length of time was new to me.''

<HEADLINE> NY-NJ 2, Columbus 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Henry Zambrano scored the game-winning  
goal and added an assist as the New York-New Jersey MetroStars 
snapped a 12-game losing streak by beating the Columbus Crew 2-1 in 
a Major League Soccer game Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Zambrano scored the winning goal after dribbling 30 yards up the  
middle of the field, turning around Crew defender Todd Yeagley, and 
blasting a shot from 10 yards out past onrushing Columbus 
goalkeeper Mark Dougherty in the 86th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Zambrano helped set up the game's first goal in the 38th minute  
on a give-and-go with Eduardo Hurtado. Zambrano passed to Hurtado, 
who scored from 20 yards out. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbus tied the game five minutes later when Mike Clark played  
a ball out of the backfield to Brian West, who passed to Brian 
McBride, who one-timed it past MetroStars' goalkeeper Mike Ammann 
from five yards out. 
</P>
<P>
	The MetroStars outshot the Crew 14-13, but Columbus led 7-4 in  
shots on goal. Ammann had six saves to Dougherty's two. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbus, which has clinched a playoff spot, fell to 16-11 in  
the Eastern Conference. New York-New Jersey improved to 6-22, but 
remained last.

<HEADLINE> Officials Fight Money Laundering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The rented Lear jet from Florida drops onto  
little-used air fields on Caribbean tax-haven islands. The 
passengers pop over to a shopping center full of banks and deposit 
millions of dollars in a dummy corporation's account, sometimes 
using rubber stamps of Minnie Mouse and Goofy as signatures on 
deposit cards. 
</P>
<P>
	A half-day's business can work up an appetite for a  
money-launderer. Thus the lunch that follows of grilled lobster and 
crayfish at a favorite Anguilla haunt, whose owner pulls the fare 
right then and there from the crisp northeastern Caribbean waters. 
</P>
<P>
	Money in the bank. Food in the stomach. Back to the plane, empty  
suitcases in hand. And back to the cache of cash in the United 
States -- until the next trip. Almost as quickly, the bank in 
Anguilla has spirited the money abroad, perhaps to New York or 
London, disguising the greenbacks' criminal origins. 
</P>
<P>
	It does not take an MBA to exploit the system, explains Kenneth  
Rijock, a former Miami lawyer who did two years in a federal prison 
on a money-laundering conviction. He now is a consultant to U.S. 
law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even a teen-ager could go down there, open up an anonymous  
account and set up a business,'' he said in a telephone interview. 
``The problem with the Caribbean is that we allow'' it to operate 
as a haven of criminal secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated $57 billion is laundered every year, U.S. officials  
say. Now in the news, with few details and no charges, is one of 
the biggest money-laundering operations ever in the United States: 
federal investigators believe Russian gangsters have channeled up 
to $10 billion through the Bank of New York, the 15th-largest bank 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Money laundering has evolved since the days when Rijock made his  
trips to the Caribbean and federal investigators put together the 
first anti-money-laundering strike force in ``Operation Greenback'' 
in Miami in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the free-for-all time,'' said Albert Tellechea, an  
attorney in Orlando, Fla., who was a federal prosecutor. ``People 
were walking into banks with paper bags full of cash.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a typical operation, Rijock said, he would fly from Florida  
in a rented jet owned by a World War II bomber pilot. The plane, 
destined for a Caribbean island, would carry drug trafficker 
clients and bags of cash. 
</P>
<P>
	On arrival, Rijock's party would meet with someone from a local  
``cooperating'' bank, who would help smooth the way through 
customs. 
</P>
<P>
	The ride to the bank was short. The money was counted, quickly,  
checked for counterfeits and deposited in an account in the name of 
a dummy corporation set up previously by local lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	The depositors were given signature cards, but they did not sign  
their own names. In one case, Rijock recounted, two of them used 
rubber stamps from a toy store with the images of Minnie Mouse and 
Goofy. Certificates of deposit were issued. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank immediately sent the deposited cash by courier to its  
correspondent bank in New York or London. Eventually, Rijock would 
transfer the money to big banks in Europe, Asia or Latin America, 
having successfully disguised its criminal source. 
</P>
<P>
	Lunch was next. The Barrel Stay, the eatery with the  
ocean-foraging owner on Anguilla's Sandy Ground Beach, was a 
particular favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a heavenly little place,'' Rijock said, with Belgian beer  
and dainty French pastries brought in by water taxi from nearby St. 
Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite its many variations, experts say money laundering always  
basically works in a three-step cycle: moving illicit money, such 
as drug trafficking profits, away from direct association with 
crimes; disguising the money trail; and making the money available 
to the criminals again with its illegal origins hidden. 
</P>
<P>
	Among major money-laundering operations in recent years were:  
</P>
<P>
	--The now-defunct Bank of Credit and Commerce International, a  
Third World institution that allegedly catered to arms smugglers, 
drug traffickers and terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
	--In the largest such case in the history of U.S. law  
enforcement, the undercover ``Operation Casablanca'' exposed 
Mexican bankers laundering millions of dollars for Colombian and 
Mexican drug cartels. More than 100 people were arrested, and 
millions of dollars seized, in May 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, with tighter anti-money-laundering laws, such as the  
requirement for banks to report customers' cash transactions of 
$10,000 or more to federal authorities, launderers have become more 
sophisticated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each criminal group has different needs and ways to move their  
financial assets,'' said Michael McDonald, a former senior special 
agent in the IRS' Criminal Investigation Division. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the rules have given rise to ``smurfing,'' the  
practice of breaking down transactions into smaller amounts that do 
not have to be reported. Instead of carrying bags of cash, money 
launderers sometimes use bank drafts and wire transfers. They move 
illicit profits through a series of bank accounts to make them 
appear to be legitimate business proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
	New tricks include creating dummy corporations or avoiding banks  
by using money transmitters like Western Union and storefront 
businesses that cash checks, sell money orders and traveler's 
checks and exchange foreign currency. 
</P>
<P>
	A complex new scheme called the ``black-market peso exchange  
system,'' which launders an estimated $5 billion a year in drug 
profits, involves purchases of U.S. products -- notably household 
appliances and cigarettes -- for export to Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombian peso brokers, who act as middlemen in the scheme, give  
Colombian importers IOUs in exchange for pesos. The pesos are used 
to buy U.S. dollars from drug cartels, providing the cartels with 
clean, usable currency. Then, the brokers use the dollars to buy 
the goods and smuggle them into Colombia on behalf of the 
importers, who thereby avoid high government tariffs and taxes on 
foreign currency exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very hard thing to detect,'' former prosecutor  
Tellechea said. ``On its face, it's a perfectly valid 
transaction.''

<HEADLINE> Americans Mesmerized by Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Claaang! A big brass bell signals the start of  
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. In the cramped tourist 
gallery, Linda and Tony Mallia and two excited grandsons are 
watching. 
</P>
<P>
	Fixing a cup of coffee at his gas station in tiny Springer,  
N.M., Jim Caldwell is tuning his TV set, watching. Colleen Astles, 
a nursing student from Georgia on vacation in Florida, is munching 
a bagel, and watching. 
</P>
<P>
	The longest bull market in history is mesmerizing Americans.  
Following the market and trading its stocks are national pastimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Kristin Smith, a cellist from Arkansas, is visiting the stock  
exchange, too. She has no stocks, but she acknowledges a vested 
interest. ``As the stock market goes, so do our fortunes,'' she 
says. ``It's really a seat of power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stand with her at the corner of Wall and Broad Streets, and feel  
the allure of Pure Capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve TV trucks wait daily outside the imposing marble  
building; more than 20 arrive when the news is really big. Visiting 
the NYSE was easy a few years ago. Now, tourists stand in lines 
that snake around the block. 
</P>
<P>
	First in line today are the Mallias, New Yorkers clutching the  
portfolio list of the grandsons who wait with them. They file into 
the gallery overlooking the trading floor. ``It's really 
wild-looking,'' says Ms. Mallia. Later, they wait three-deep at the 
gift counter to buy souvenir pens. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks attract more than America's tourists. Investors check and  
recheck their numbers, following every winner and loser. Some carry 
pagers that scroll the stock ticker. Others quit their jobs to 
hunker over computers and trade all day. 
</P>
<P>
	With the rise of do-it-yourself retirement plans, Americans from  
janitors to CEOs control their financial futures. And with four 
years of double-digit returns, they're putting their money in 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Caldwell, 33, a ``low-risk kind of guy,'' invests in mutual  
funds, hoping to earn a little something to leave his three 
children. He follows such specific sectors of the market as voice 
recognition technology. ``It's kind of a hobby,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Nowadays, like Caldwell, 43 percent of American households own  
stock, either directly or through mutual funds and pension 
accounts. Edward Wolff, an economist at New York University, charts 
the rise from nearly 25 percent in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	About 160 billion shares changed hands in 1997, up 27 percent  
from the previous yea -- on the NYSE, its main competitor Nasdaq, 
the smaller American Stock Exchange and five tiny regional 
exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	The bull market that preceded the 1929 crash also attracted many  
Americans. Books on investing and betting on stocks grew popular, 
says John Steele Gordon, historian and author of the upcoming book, 
``The Great Game: The Emergence of Wall Street as a World Power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, at no other time has the market touched as many Americans  
as today. The poorest 40 percent of U.S. households now invests an 
average of $1,600 in stocks, up from $300 (in today's dollars) in 
1962. Children are investing, too: Stein Roe's $1 billion Young 
Investor Fund has ballooned to 190,000 shareholders from 4,000 
since it was created five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter that the wealthiest 10 percent of Americans still  
dominate, owning 82 percent of the value of all stocks. The 
stampeding market has made it possible for all to dream. 
</P>
<P>
	Online brokerages, trying to wrest control from Wall Street's  
elite, feed investor hopes with catchy ads. ``Someone's going to 
win the Lottery. Just Not You,'' warns an ETrade magazine ad. ``We 
just think waiting for those magic numbers to hit might take a 
while. At ETrade, we're used to things moving faster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Discover Brokerage television ad, now nominated for an Emmy  
award, features a tow-truck driver boasting of his online-trading 
prowess. The punch line? He just bought an island. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some advertisements more closely resemble commercials for the  
lottery than anything else,'' scolds Securities and Exchange 
Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt. ``We ... should not get manic 
about the mania.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet new millionaires do fuel the excitement. The 401(k)  
millionaires who never expected their retirement funds to fatten to 
seven figures. The paper millionaires, those 20-something Internet 
upstarts who sell their companies' stock. The investor millionaires 
who caught Amazon.com's meteoric run-up to $221.25 in April, then 
got out before it halved. 
</P>
<P>
	But in order to win, investors need to learn. And nowadays,  
they're hungry for market lore. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 108 new business and finance magazines -- nearly triple  
those of the early 90s -- are now published. Nearly 7,500 Web sites 
are geared to investing. Amateur investment clubs abound, doubling 
to 37,000 since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Mets fans now absorb a half-hour of financial buzz at each home  
game. Three other ballparks may match the 30-foot-long electronic 
signs in Shea Stadium's outfield. 
</P>
<P>
	New York's Times Square, so recently a porn pit, flashes the  
country's newest fetish: big stock zippers. Nasdaq plans a 
14,000-square-foot sign at a reported cost of $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Each week, CNBC, a cable network entering adolescence, reaches 7  
million homes -- plus offices, restaurants, airports, prisons, 
college dorms, hospital rooms.

	Its reporters are unwitting celebrities. CNBC Anchor Sue Herera  
is shocked by the fame once reserved for rock stars. She's so 
besieged that she registers at hotels under her maiden name and 
asks her husband to pick up Chinese take-out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to get out of there with my food, and the cook's  
asking, 'What's with Intel?','' she recalls, laughing, over a lunch 
of roast salmon near the network's studios in Fort Lee, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in five cities, CNBC is televising its ``Power  
Lunch'' segment, attracting a crowd at each stop. Colleen Astles 
drove 30 miles from Woodstock, Ga., to Atlanta to see the filming. 
Each day, she checks her stocks via the Internet and catches three 
hours of CNBC. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm watching it right now!'' she says, from vacation in  
Sarasota. ``If you buy a car, it depreciates. You buy Microsoft, 
and for the most part, it goes up, if you're in it for the long 
run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The long run -- that's the mantra of stock market gurus. Buy,  
then hold on to it. But the hopeful get antsy. 
</P>
<P>
	``You get crazed. You see the numbers always,'' says Ms. Mallia,  
the grandmother visiting the NYSE. ``Our broker told us to turn off 
CNBC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The longer a person has an Internet trading account the more  
trades he makes, according to NFO Worldwide, a research group based 
in Greenwich, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	``People think if they're not active in the market, they're not  
doing the right thing. They feel they have to move,'' says Muriel 
Siebert, the Wall Street doyenne who in 1969 became the first woman 
to own a seat on the NYSE. She frets: ``It's been too easy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nonsense, argues Tracey Curvey, head of the online brokerage at  
Fidelity Investments. The explosion of financial information is 
creating smarter investors, and technology offers them the 
opportunity to control their futures, she says. ``It's really about 
convenience and control, not about obsession.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But for many, there is that thrill.  
</P>
<P>
	Zach Mader, a 20-year-old who studies the business of farming at  
the University of Nebraska at Kearney, believes there's money to be 
made in today's market, especially if you hold on. 
</P>
<P>
	Why, then, does he trade three, four, five times a week and  
follow 60 or 70 stocks each day? ``For the thrill,'' concedes 
Mader, who says his dad, a farmer, at first tried to discourage him 
from investing. ``It's kind of a gamble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mader is keeping his head, not letting investing eclipse his  
studies. But others aren't. Last winter, National Discount Brokers, 
of New York, linked its Web site to netaddiction.com, a group that 
helps trading addicts. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, uptown from the stock exchange, is Tradescape.com,  
an office strewn with soda cans, pizza boxes and coffee cups. 
There, day-traders, some of the market's most hard-core 
thrill-seekers, sit before computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6 million investors who trade online in their spare time far  
outnumber the estimated 5,000 day-traders nationwide. But both 
groups represent the extremes of market frenzy, propelling its 
success -- and notoriety. 
</P>
<P>
	Such day-traders are indelibly linked to Mark O. Barton, the  
day-trader with reported losses who killed 12 people in Atlanta, 
including nine at two trading firms. 
</P>
<P>
	At Tradescape, 180 traders, up from last year's 25, play the  
market's tiniest ups and downs. Jorge Linares, eyes glued to the 
screen and fingers tapping, buys 100 shares of Healtheon Corp., an 
Internet health care company, at $55.25. Seconds later, he sells at 
$55, losing a total of $25. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has the little rush, like the casino,'' says the  
23-year-old, who has a new bachelor's degree in economics and art 
history. He watches as the stock falls to $53.37 1/2 and is jubilant 
that he didn't lose more. 
</P>
<P>
	This morning, he's already lost $3,000. ``I wouldn't want to do  
this when I'm 30, with a family and a wife,'' he says, typing 
constantly. ``When you're fresh out of school, you can take the 
most risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Claaang! The bell sounds. The market closes.

	On this day, Jim Caldwell saw Apple Computer rise $1.56 1/4 to  
$60.75. Colleen Astles tracked Home Depot, up $1.43 3/4 to $64.25. At

<HEADLINE> Grand Central Fire Closes Subway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Grand Central Terminal was evacuated Sunday and  
train service was halted because of smoke from a fire in a subway 
tunnel beneath the landmark. 
</P>
<P>
	Two people were treated for smoke inhalation.  
</P>
<P>
	The fire, which was under control within an hour, started in  
building materials in a storage room on the Lexington Avenue subway 
line, said Assistant Fire Chief Frank Cruthers. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoke quickly spread upward through Grand Central's main  
terminal in mid-Manhattan and onto the street. The building was 
evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Smoke got thick really fast,'' said Sam Southworth, who was on  
the subway station platform when the fire broke out. 
</P>
<P>
	Service on the Lexington Avenue subway line along the East Side  
was suspended from 86th Street to the Brooklyn Bridge in lower 
Manhattan. Metro-North Commuter Railroad service, which runs from 
Grand Central to suburban Westchester County and Connecticut, also 
was disrupted. Service was fully restored by Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Built in 1913, Grand Central was rededicated in 1998 after a  
$200 million, 10-year renovation. It features soaring, vaulted 
windows, a colossal marble-floored concourse, grandiose stairways, 
chandeliers and sculpture inspired by Greek and Roman mythology. It 
is considered the finest example of Beaux Arts architecture in 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	The main concourse's ceiling -- painted like a night sky with  
gold-leaf constellations and twinkling light bulb stars -- had to be 
cleaned by hand to remove decades of pollution and tobacco smoke. 
There was no immediate indication whether it was affected by smoke 
from Sunday's fire.

<HEADLINE> Gore Denies 'Clinton Fatigue' Notion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANOLA, Iowa (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore denied Sunday that  
so-called Clinton fatigue is dogging his campaign and said history 
foretells a rebound in next year's election. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is probably in a stronger position in the seventh year of  
any president that I can remember,'' Gore said of President Clinton 
in an interview with The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	While Gore leads in most polls for the Democratic nomination,  
those surveys suggest he would face general-election trouble 
against Texas Gov. George W. Bush, front-runner in the Republican 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts say Gore is suffering from his association with  
Clinton because voters are tired of the Monica Lewinsky scandal and 
the president's other controversies. And former New Jersey Sen. 
Bill Bradley argues for a ``fresh start'' in his nomination contest 
with Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gore argued there's little new in public sentiment as  
Clinton winds down his administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``History shows that there's a well-established pattern that,  
regardless of the individual, regardless of the party, whenever our 
country has a two-term president, there's a feeling in the seventh 
year that has been described by different labels,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the eighth year there's a renewed burst of energy and  
positive feeling about what's been done and the reasons why a 
president has had two terms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue is delicate for Gore: He is trying to establish his  
own identity and distance himself from the administration's 
troubles without jeopardizing his ties to Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore asserted the dynamics of the race will change as an  
election still 14 months away approaches and voters begin to focus. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you look at the overwhelming positive view of the  
policies this administration has followed and the president's 
leadership, especially on the economy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, on his own campaign swing through Iowa, at first declined  
to talk about someone who ``hasn't won his party's nomination 
yet,'' but then aimed a few words at the vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I trust people to make the right decisions for their lives,''  
said Bush. ``It seems the potential nominee of the Democratic Party 
trusts government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore shot back: ``I'm going to let him take the negative road.''  
</P>
<P>
	Also in the interview, Gore:  
</P>
<P>
	--Said the U.S. role in a proposed peacekeeping force in East  
Timor was still evolving. ``We have not ruled in or out any form of 
participation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Refused to be drawn into the debate over Clinton's granting of  
clemency to a group of Puerto Rican nationalists. ``Under the 
Constitution our founders gave that power to the president, without 
any checks or balances,'' said Gore. ``I'm not going to stand in 
judgment of his decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GOP presidential candidate Steve Forbes had challenged Gore to  
take a stand, calling Clinton's clemency offer a 
``terrorists-for-votes deal'' to help Hillary Rodham Clinton win a 
Senate seat in New York.

<HEADLINE> Floyd Strengthens, Nears Bahamas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Storm-weary residents in the Bahamas  
braced for a brush with Hurricane Floyd as it swelled and powered 
up to a major storm, packing winds of up to 145 mph on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the Bahamas -- a 600-mile-long line of islands -- was under  
hurricane warnings or watches. Forecasters said they might also 
issue a hurricane watch for part of Florida's east coast Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	If Floyd stays on its current path, it would hit the coast of  
Florida between West Palm Beach and Cocoa Beach. Forecasters 
expected the hurricane to begin turning north before landfall, 
though perhaps not much before. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. hurricane hunter airplane reported Sunday evening that  
Floyd's winds had topped the 131 mph mark of a very dangerous 
Category 4 storm. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't expect such a very fast intensification today,'' said  
Jerry Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami. 
``This is a real surprise for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hurricane Andrew had Category 4 status when it struck South  
Florida in 1992, killing 26 people and causing an estimated $25 
billion in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts said that by Tuesday Hurricane Floyd could approach the  
Abacos Islands and Eleuthera, which were blasted last month by 
Hurricane Dennis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just got back on my feet from last month's scare,'' sighed  
Marie Johnson of Nassau as she pulled out a few bills to pay for 
flashlight and radio batteries at the City Market grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. National Weather Service recommended people along the  
southeast coast monitor the storm's course. 
</P>
<P>
	In Florida, emergency management officials began mobilizing,  
with the state's Emergency Operations Center in Tallahassee calling 
in essential personnel for 'round-the-clock staffing. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Floridians took advantage of the weekend's final day to  
take careful inventory of their hurricane supplies. Osvaldo Ibarra, 
hardware manager at a Home Depot in Miami, said sales were brisk 
for batteries, nails, rope and hurricane shutter fasteners. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are really buying the extra screws, the rope, and we've  
seen a lot more generator sales,'' Ibarra said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, south of the storm's  
center, meteorologists warned that the terrain was already 
saturated, and that there could be heavy flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials posted warnings for Hurricane Floyd across the central  
Bahamas and hurricane watches throughout the northwest Bahamas. 
Tropical storm warnings were in effect for the southeast Bahamas 
and Britain's Turks and Caicos Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm swelled in size during the weekend. Hurricane-force  
winds had broadened to 115 miles from Floyd's center by Sunday. 
Tropical storm force winds extended another 175 miles, and 
forecasters said the storm would likely strengthen overnight 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 p.m. EDT, Floyd was centered about 330 miles east of San  
Salvador in the central Bahamas, and was moving west at near 14 
mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd's center is likely to pass close to the capital, Nassau,  
on Tuesday morning, said Arthur Rolle, deputy director of the 
Bahamas Meteorological Department. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, tourists in Nassau watched weather reports nervously.  
Honeymooners Michael and Julie Smith of Reynoldsburg, Ohio, 
lamented their bad luck. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope this doesn't mean our marriage is going to be like this  
-- messed up,'' Michael said. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents Jean and Jerry Isaacs said they had canceled plans to  
spend a few days in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could get over okay today, but by the way things are going,  
it'll be tough getting back,'' Jean Isaacs said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, Floyd was joined Sunday by Tropical Storm Gert, which  
formed midway between Africa and Barbados. Forecasters said it was 
gathering strength quickly and could become a hurricane Sunday 
night or Monday.

<HEADLINE> UAW Seeking Gains in Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Stopping a slow erosion in membership is a major  
goal of the United Auto Workers union -- and a thorny issue in talks 
to replace national contracts that expire Tuesday with the major 
U.S. automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1979, the UAW has seen its ranks of active members decline  
from 1.5 million to 846,000 in 1998. The erosion was caused in part 
by an aging membership, more non-union factories, automakers 
needing fewer workers and limited success at organizing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Organizing is our lifeblood,'' UAW President Stephen P. Yokich  
told members in a Labor Day statement. ``As the economy has 
changed, the percentage of union representation has gone down. 
There are powerful forces that want it to go down even more. That's 
dangerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those economic changes have included the shedding of thousands  
of jobs at General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and the Chrysler 
division of DaimlerChrysler AG over the past two decades. GM and 
Ford have also moved to separate their parts divisions, Delphi and 
Visteon, as they try to reduce costs against stiff competition from 
foreign brands. 
</P>
<P>
	That often has meant closing older factories that employed  
thousands in favor of building new, more efficient ones. This 
month, GM will close its V-8 engine plant in Flint, swapping it for 
a new Flint plant scheduled to open in 2001. The old plant employed 
4,000 workers in 1992 and has 1,600 workers now. The new plant will 
employ about 750 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	While some of the cuts have come from layoffs, others have come  
by not replacing workers who quit or retire. As a result, the 
average UAW worker in a GM, Ford or Chrysler plant is almost 47 
years old, and has 19 years on the job. Nearly half of the 407,000 
workers the UAW represents at the three automakers will be eligible 
to retire in five years. 
</P>
<P>
	And American automakers still lag their competitors in  
efficiency, according to an annual report by Harbour and 
Associates. Earlier this year, it found that GM and DaimlerChrysler 
could cut tens of thousands of jobs if they were as productive as 
Toyota's North American plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of Toyota's plants are non-union, as are many other  
American plants of foriegn automakers. Their growth, along with the 
drive to contract work to non-union parts suppliers, has cut into 
UAW membership. While the union increased membership last year, 
most of the gain came from organizing workers in other industries, 
such as health care and government. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's extremely expensive and time-consuming to organize  
workers in the U.S.,'' said Gary Chaison, an industrial relations 
professor at Clark University in Massachusetts. ``It takes more 
than devoting money and manpower. They've got to find new ways of 
appealing to workers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the new ways the UAW could keep and add members is by  
enlisting the help of the automakers. According to a union 
newsletter, the UAW's first proposal to GM included provisions for 
an ``America First'' policy that would guarantee jobs and 
investment in UAW plants. 
</P>
<P>
	The union also asked for a ``Corporate Code of Conduct'' that  
would include a commitment to recognize workers' rights to organize 
and join unions. It proposed a ban on outsourcing -- sending work 
from a factory to an outside supplier -- backed by a right to strike 
over sourcing disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	Other UAW proposals included increasing overtime pay and adding  
time off for overtime hours. Automakers rely on overtime to keep 
employment levels down; the average GM worker put in nearly 9 hours 
of overtime a week last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW also asked for a seat on GM's board of directors. Yokich  
already sits on the DaimlerChrysler supervisory board. 
</P>
<P>
	UAW officials either could not be reached or declined to comment  
on the talks. Company officials also declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	David Cole, director of the University of Michigan's Office for  
the Study of Automotive Transportation, said there was little 
chance the UAW could stop the decline in membership from the 
automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what the UAW is really targeting is not so much  
growing or preserving membership in the Big Three, which isn't 
going to happen,'' he said. ``They're really going to target the 
supplier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Cole and Chaison said that could be a tough task. Cole said  
many parts suppliers have made moves similar to the automakers, 
cutting jobs and opening more efficient plants. Many of those 
plants have been built in states where pro-union feelings are 
weaker than in Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	The new plants locate ``where workers don't come from union  
families, where they have the first high-paying factory jobs,'' 
Chaison said. ``They want to keep those jobs and they're afraid the 
union will threaten those jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such concerns are the fuel for the debate over Ford's plans to  
spin off its Visteon parts unit and the 23,500 UAW members who work 
there. Ford officials have said the division can't generate enough 
sales to compete with outside suppliers unless it's independent. 
But the UAW contends that spinning Visteon off would eventually 
lead to fewer jobs and lower pay. 
</P>
<P>
	But given the profitability of the industry, and the harm that  
would come from a strike, experts say the union will likely aim for 
a deal that satisfies both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	``They will say we are willing to be flexible if you provide job  
security,'' Chaison said. ``They have to say we're not against new 
processes or technology. We're against the bad effects they would 
have on membership.''

	Indonesia OKs East Timor Peacekeepers  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Under intense international pressure,  
Indonesia announced today it would allow an international 
peacekeeping force to restore order to the devastated territory of 
East Timor. Global leaders applauded the decision, which came a day 
after 50 U.N. ambassadors condemned Indonesia for letting East 
Timor slide into anarchy. President Clinton's national security 
adviser, Sandy Berger, said the United States hopes the 
peacekeepers -- led by Australia and largely with forces from Asian 
nations -- will deploy ``in the next several days.''

	Indonesian Refugees Face Starvation

<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Starving in East Timor's hills or  
menaced in refugee camps, hundreds of thousands of people chased 
from their homes by Indonesian troops and pro-Indonesian militias 
are staring death in the face. Many have no food, water or money. 
Reports filtering out by cellular phone calls say some people are 
foraging for bananas and roots, under constant threat of attack. 
Some 300,000 people from a population of 850,000 are believed to 
have been driven from their homes in the past week.

is becoming a Bush campaign adviser on farm issues. Branstad had 
supported former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, who withdrew from 
the race after a poor showing in the Iowa straw poll. Bush said 
Branstad's support gives a significant organizational boost to his 
bid for the nomination. Though Bush leads in most polls, he said he 
will focus heavily on the Iowa caucuses, which open the 
presidential nominating season.

	Buchanan Might Be Reform Candidate  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- GOP presidential contender Pat Buchanan came  
closer than ever today to saying he would quit the Republican race 
and campaign for the Reform Party's nomination. ``The door really 
is wide open,'' Buchanan said. ``We are very close to making that 
decision.'' Reform Party leader Jesse Ventura, the Minnesota 
governor, has discounted suggestions the party should nominate 
Buchanan for president. He has said the party backs conservative 
economic principles, not Buchanan's social conservatism on abortion 
and other issues.

tendon and is out for the year. Testaverde was hurt during the 
first half of today's game against New England. Testaverde did not 
get up after being hit during a scramble for a fumble. He was

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Andre Agassi will face off later this afternoon  
against Todd Martin in an All-American final of the U.S. Open 
tennis tournament. Agassi, winner of the French Open and runner-up 
at Wimbledon this summer, regained the No. 1 ranking yesterday as 
he advanced to the title match against Martin, the new No. 4 after 
a 6-4, 6-1, 6-2 romp over Cedric Pioline. The all American final 
will be only the fifth here in the Open era, which began in 1968, 
and the first since Pete Sampras beat Michael Chang in 1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- A Hindu nationalist-led alliance forged  
ahead in India's election race Sunday, where voting for nearly half 
of the 545-seat lower house of parliament was completed over the 
weekend, newspaper and television reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	An exit poll by a private television network for the first round  
of voting held last week said Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee 
and his allies were set to gain 17 seats. 
</P>
<P>
	The opposition Congress Party and its partners were likely to  
lose 13 seats, according to the exit poll, which covered 133 of 145 
seats up for grabs in the first round of voting on Sept. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Democratic of Alliance, led by Vajpayee, was  
expected to win 77 of those 133 seats, and the Congress party and 
its allies 56 seats, according to the exit poll. 
</P>
<P>
	The television network defied a Supreme Court directive against  
broadcasting the findings. 
</P>
<P>
	A second phase of voting for another 124 seats of the lower  
house, was held Saturday. The five-phase election, to be completed 
Oct. 3, is spread out to allow security forces to move from one 
voting district to another. 
</P>
<P>
	An independent Election Commission has banned publication or  
broadcast of opinion and exit polls during the month-long voting 
process, fearing that the results would influence those who have 
yet to vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Five Supreme Court judges are expected to rule next week on  
whether that ban is constitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	Early opinion polls favored caretaker Prime Minister Atal Bihari  
Vajpayee's BJP and its allies to win more than 300 seats in the 
545-seat lower house of parliament. In April, Vajpayee's government 
lost a parliamentary vote of confidence by one vote, which 
precipitated India's third election in as many years. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's voting was marred by a political activist's killing,  
stolen ballot papers and water poured into ballot boxes. Nearly 56 
percent of 77 million people in the districts cast their votes 
across eight states. 
</P>
<P>
	In western Maharashtra state, Sharad Leve of the opposition  
National Congress party was killed and one of his supporters 
wounded in an attack by Bharatiya Janata Party workers, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police arrested a junior minister in Maharashtra in connection  
with the attack. Political rivalry was believed to be the motive. 
</P>
<P>
	The election campaign has largely failed to address the  
country's most pressing issues: poverty and economic reform. 
Congress Party president Sonia Gandhi's Italian birth -- and whether 
she has the moral right to be India's prime minister -- has been one 
of the major issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Voting also will be held on Sept. 18, 25 and Oct. 3 and ballots  
will be counted a few days later. The 545-member lower house of 
parliament must be in place by mid-October.

<HEADLINE> Detroit Receiver's String Snapped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Herman Moore, the Detroit Lions' star wide  
receiver, had a pass-catching streak of 107 straight games broken 
when he sprained his left knee in the opening quarter against the 
Seattle Seahawks on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	He had to be helped off the field and then was taken by a  
motorized cart into the Lions' dressing room. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore, starting his ninth NFL season, was injured on a 10-yard  
completion from Charlie Batch to Germane Crowell with 2:56 left in 
the first quarter. On the play, guard Tony Semple fell into Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	His reception streak tied him for 10th longest in NFL history.  
It was the second-longest active streak going into Sunday behind 
San Francisco's Jerry Rice, who caught passes in 193 straight 
games.

<HEADLINE> Bellisari May Be Buckeyes' QB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Two weeks after a horrendous debut, Steve  
Bellisari probably won the starting quarterback job at Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
	Bellisari came off the bench to toss two touchdown passes and  
was on the field for five of Ohio State's six touchdowns as the 
13th-ranked Buckeyes bounced back from an early 10-0 deficit for a 
42-20 victory over No. 21 UCLA on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Bellisari was also the Buckeyes' second-leading rusher with 50  
yards on three third-down scrambles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a real sweet feeling that we executed so well,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Ohio State's 23-12 loss to Miami on Aug. 29, the feeling  
wasn't nearly so sweet. 
</P>
<P>
	Starter Austin Moherman led Ohio State to an early 10-7 lead  
when Bellisari got the call from coach John Cooper. Moments after 
he took the field, he lost 11 yards on an aborted lateral that took 
the Buckeyes out of field goal position. Then on his next play, he 
fumbled the snap from center and Miami recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had something to prove tonight,'' Bellisari said after  
completing 11 of 16 passes for 159 yards and running for 50 yards 
on three third-down scrambles. 
</P>
<P>
	``No question he was the best quarterback on the field  
tonight,'' Cooper said. ``I would imagine he'll be the starting 
quarterback after we look at the films.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What might stand out on the films won't be anything he did with  
the ball, but rather what he did after getting rid of it. In the 
fourth quarter, Bellisari pitched the ball to flanker Ken-Yon Rambo 
on an end around, then leveled a UCLA tackler with a jarring block. 
</P>
<P>
	``That block was a good feeling,'' Bellisari said. ``It meant a  
lot to me. That probably was the play I'll remember from this 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The contact was nothing new for the 6-foot-3, 220-pound  
Bellisari. He came to Ohio State as a highly regarded quarterback, 
but to get playing time as a freshman he was a backup strong safety 
and a vicious hitter on special teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Berry, a starting safety, recognized the contribution that  
Bellisari made against the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steve got our team up and electrified,'' Berry said. ``He got  
things going. He does that everyday in practice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even the opposition agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thought Bellisari hurt us running the football and he threw  
a couple of deep balls that got us as well,'' UCLA coach Bob Toledo 
said. ``I think they found a quarterback.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moherman started for the Buckeyes (1-1) and completed 10 of 19  
passes for 107 yards with one interception. 
</P>
<P>
	Bellisari wasn't Ohio State's only weapon. Michael Wiley rushed  
for 119 yards and two touchdowns and Ken-Yon Rambo caught a pair of 
TD passes -- both from Bellisari. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the defense shut down UCLA's wide-open attack,  
intercepting two passes. It was the first time in 27 games that 
UCLA (1-1) did not score at least 24 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State won its 21st straight home opener before 93,283 in  
only the fourth night game in Ohio Stadium's 78 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA was playing without nine starters and four backups who  
received two-game suspensions for illegally obtaining and using 
handicapped-parking placards.

<HEADLINE> HBO Holds Edge at Emmy Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Kristen Johnston of ``3rd Rock From the Sun''  
was named best supporting actress in a comedy and David Hyde Pierce 
won the supporting actor's honor for ``Frasier'' at Sunday night's 
Emmys. 
</P>
<P>
	Holland Taylor and Michael Badalucco from ABC's drama series,  
``The Practice,'' swept the best supporting actress and actor 
awards. 
</P>
<P>
	``You crazy kids. I can't believe this, really,'' said Miss  
Johnston as she accepted the award, her second for her role in the 
NBC sitcom. 
</P>
<P>
	Emmy host Pierce won his third Emmy as best supporting actor in  
a comedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``So glad I put on pants,'' Pierce said, after he had quickly  
changed from a purple unitard into a tuxedo. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony at the Shrine Auditorium opened with an off-beat  
number performed by Pierce and Jenna Elfman of ``Dharma &AMP; Greg.'' 
The two, appearing in matching purple unitards, performed 
interpretive dance numbers poking fun at popular television series. 
</P>
<P>
	Badalucco, picking up his first career Emmy for his role as a  
not-too-slick lawyer with blue collar roots, thanked viewers who 
``take us into your home and hearts each week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``John Leguizamo's Freak'' won an Emmy for best performance in a  
variety or music program. Leguizamo thanked HBO, dubbing it the 
``Hispanic Box Office,'' and said he welcomed the chance to do his 
one-man show for TV because ``the Latin voice is something that's 
lacking and missing in the media.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke on the opening day of a two-week television viewing  
boycott organized by Hispanic groups angry at television because of 
its lack of ethnic diversity. The National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People is considering similar action. 
</P>
<P>
	HBO's mob drama ``The Sopranos'' and the quirky Fox legal series  
``Ally McBeal'' led all the nominees going into the show. 
</P>
<P>
	Both shows competed in six of the 27 categories lined up for  
trophy presentations during the three-hour televised show. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Sopranos'' grabbed 16 of the nominations announced in July  
by the Academy of Television Arts &AMP; Sciences. Thirteen nods each 
were handed out to the CBS miniseries ``Joan of Arc'' and two David 
E. Kelley productions: ``Ally McBeal'' and the more serious legal 
drama ``The Practice,'' on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	Winners in 52 categories were announced at the Emmy creative  
arts awards held Aug. 28. ``The Sopranos'' and ``Ally McBeal'' each 
won two trophies then. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's show was expected to be seen in about 90 countries, the  
academy said. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	In last month's non-televised ceremony, awards were announced in  
craft categories, including outstanding choreography, editing and 
makeup. 
</P>
<P>
	Four acting awards for guest roles also were given out.  
</P>
<P>
	Mel Brooks was honored as outstanding guest actor in a comedy  
series for his role as Uncle Phil on NBC's ``Mad About You,'' while 
Tracey Ullman was named in the matching actress category for her 
role as a therapist on ``Ally McBeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Herrmann's role as a murder defendant on ``The Practice''  
was honored with an Emmy in the drama category, while Debra Monk 
received an award for guest-starring on ``NYPD Blue'' as Detective 
Andy Sipowicz's ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
	For best commercial, the award went to snap.com, an Internet  
service.

<HEADLINE> Emotional Win Boosts Purdue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) -- Purdue's offense is a known  
quantity. Now, maybe teams will get to know the Boilermakers 
defense as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Backed against their own goal line with time running out and  
rival Notre Dame threatening to steal a win on the road, the No. 14 
Boilermakers responded with two keys stops -- aided by Notre Dame's 
own confusion -- to win 28-23 on Saturday and improve to 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an emotional builder,'' said Purdue linebacker Mike Rose,  
who dropped Jarious Jackson for a 9-yard loss on the game's final 
play. ``For so long, since coach (Joe) Tiller and the staff got in 
here, everybody has focused on the offense. We're not ashamed of 
that or embarrassed about that as a defense, but it makes us want 
to go out there and get some attention, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But more importantly, Purdue's defensive stand was the kind of  
moment that can alter a season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are building blocks,'' Tiller said. ``Those are things  
you can point to and you can say, `Hey guys, here is where we came 
from and here's where we want to get to, and this is what's going 
to take us there, so let's get our shoulder to the grindstone and 
get to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue's final stand didn't start out so well. With just more  
than two minutes, 30 seconds left, Jackson began driving the Irish 
downfield from the Boilermakers' 41. 
</P>
<P>
	On second-and-17, Purdue defensive back Adrian Beasley was  
called for pass interference, putting the Irish on the 26. Two 
plays later, Jackson hit Raki Nelson for 11 yards down to the 9, 
and followed that with a 7-yard pass to fullback Joey Goodspeed, 
who seemed to fumble the ball. After the Irish recovered in the end 
zone, two officials signaled touchdown, but a third ruled the ball 
was down. 
</P>
<P>
	On second-and-goal, Tony Driver then ran up the middle for 1  
yard, and the Irish called timeout with 16 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Bob Davie said he called for two running plays out of a  
wishbone formation, but Goodspeed was confused by a fake check call 
at the line and relayed the incorrect play to the running backs. 
</P>
<P>
	They went one way, Jackson went another, and the Irish went  
down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I take responsibility for that. I shouldn't have allowed that  
to happen. There shouldn't have been potential for any kind of a 
check in that end zone,'' Davie said. 
</P>
<P>
	So while the Irish try to regroup, Tiller reminded his players  
that this game won't mean anything in October, when the 
Boilermakers play No. 6 Michigan, No. 13 Ohio State and Minnesota 
on the road, and play host to Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're on a roller coaster and we take a dip down next week,  
then this week doesn't mean anything,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Notre Dame can ill afford a dip next week, either. The Irish  
lost to Purdue for just the second time in 14 tries and fell to 1-2 
for the second time in three seasons and just the 11th time this 
century. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss also knocked Notre Dame from 16th to 24th in the latest  
rankings. 
</P>
<P>
	Davie also is in infamous company in Notre Dame history. He  
became the third coach to lead the Irish in 1-2 starts in multiple 
seasons, along with Gerry Faust and Joe Kuharich. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our football team was devastated. Our coaching staff was  
devastated,'' said Davie, who didn't sleep Saturday night. ``That's 
how it was.''

<HEADLINE> Swiss To Probe Russia-NY Bank Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERN, Switzerland (AP) -- Already aiding a Russian investigation  
into allegations of Kremlin corruption, Swiss prosecutors say 
they're ready to help a U.S. probe of a possible mammoth 
money-laundering case involving a New York bank and Russian 
mobsters. 
</P>
<P>
	Under legal agreements with other countries, Swiss prosecutors  
must first get a request from a foreign prosecutor before they can 
look for evidence in Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we had a request of judicial assistance, we would be active  
in helping them,'' said Dominique Reymond, spokesman for 
Switzerland's top crime-fighter, Federal Prosecutor Carla del 
Ponte. 
</P>
<P>
	Switzerland and Swiss banks want to show the world they have no  
desire to harbor ill-gotten gains, Reymond said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had those problems with Nazi gold and Holocaust assets,''  
he added. ``That should not happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government and banks are striving to repair an image  
tarnished by accusations they dragged their feet for decades in 
repaying assets deposited by victims of Nazi Germany. The banks 
agreed last summer to pay $1.25 billion to Holocaust survivors, 
their heirs and other victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Del Ponte, who is taking over as chief prosecutor of the  
Yugoslav war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, has made a 
mark by aggressively combatting corruption and money laundering by 
the mafia. 
</P>
<P>
	She kicked off the Kremlin investigation in early 1998 by  
telling Russia's prosecutor general, Yuri Skuratov, that she had 
evidence of high-level corruption by Russian officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on two official requests for help from Russia after her  
tip, Swiss investigators have seized bank accounts and other 
documents to look for evidence that could be of interest to Russian 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Many documents were passed to the Russians in several stages  
earlier this year, Reymond said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Swiss prosecutor's office is ready to extend the  
same assistance to the United States if officials ask for help in 
the investigation of alleged money laundering through the Bank of 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	American investigators reportedly believe that up to $10 billion  
was illegally channeled by the Russian mob through the bank. No one 
has been charged, but the case has been described as potentially 
one of the biggest money-laundering affairs ever uncovered in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	If U.S. authorities come up with evidence that indicates  
Switzerland also was used to launder Russian money, they can obtain 
Swiss judiciary assistance by providing names and other specifics. 
</P>
<P>
	Since it emerged in 1986 that former Philippines President  
Ferdinand Marcos had stashed tens of millions of dollars in Swiss 
banks, Switzerland has sought to make it more difficult for despots 
to hide money here or for money launderers to use a Swiss 
connection. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not only a legal obligation, but also a moral one,''  
Reymond said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Russian case, where allegations reach as high as  
President Boris Yeltsin, investigations involve three locations in 
Switzerland -- the southern canton of Ticino and the cities of 
Lausanne and Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
	Last January, Swiss authorities raided the Mabetex construction  
company in Lugano in connection with suspicions that several 
high-ranking Russian officials received ``a great deal of money'' 
for helping the firm get large contracts for renovating the 
Kremlin, Reymond said. 
</P>
<P>
	Skuratov, who was suspended by Yeltsin as prosecutor last March,  
told The Associated Press on Sept. 3 that he had received documents 
from Del Ponte suggesting that Yeltsin and his two daughters 
received kickbacks from Mabetex. 
</P>
<P>
	A top Kremlin official immediately denied the allegations.  
Behgjet Pacolli, president of Mabetex, also has denied any 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	In separate raids on two firms in Lausanne on July 1, Del Ponte  
led teams that confiscated documents in connection with Russian 
investigations of several people suspected of money laundering and 
fraud, Reymond said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Russian general prosecutor's office suspects these people  
of having conspired on a large scale in order to embezzle public 
funds,'' he said.

	Indonesia OKs International Peacekeepers  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- In a national television address,  
Indonesian President B.J. Habibie said Sunday he would allow an 
international peacekeeping force to help end the rampages by 
pro-Indonesian militias and Indonesian troops that have killed 
hundreds of East Timorese. The violence began when the former 
Portuguese colony voted for independence on Aug. 30. Jakarta 
reversed its defiant refusal of outside help under pressure from 
governments around the world horrified by the slaughter sweeping 
East Timor since the vote. A limited number of American troops will 
be deployed to support the mission.

	No Deal on N. Korea's Missile Program

	BERLIN (AP) -- Western military analysts believe North Korea  
plans to test an advanced model of a long-range missile, but six 
days of meetings in Berlin between U.S. and North Korean 
negotiators ended today with no agreement on freezing the program. 
A U.S. statement said the discussions were ``productive'' and that 
both sides would seek to promote ``a positive atmosphere'' until 
they meet again. The communist nation's missile programs are seen 
as a threat to East Asia's military balance.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Angered by the Justice Department's failure to  
produce crucial documents, GOP lawmakers today promised a broader 
investigation of the 1993 Waco siege than the one planned by a 
special counsel. Top Republicans continued to press for Attorney 
General Janet Reno's ouster while the administration pledged its 
support. Meantime, former Sen. John Danforth, the Missouri 
Republican appointed by Reno to lead the independent investigation, 
said he would try to avoid a political inquiry.

	Russian Tycoon's Accounts Said Frozen

<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Swiss bank accounts linked to a Russian tycoon who  
is reputed to have close ties to Presdient Boris Yeltsin have been 
frozen, a top prosecutor said in an interview broadcast today. 
Russian media have connected Boris Berezovsky to an investigation 
into whether money belonging to the state-controlled airline 
Aeroflot was misappropriated through two Swiss companies. Russian 
prosecutors suspect that Berezovsky set up two firms to hide $250 
million of Aeroflot's hard-currency earnings outside Russia. 
Berezovsky has denied the accusations. Swiss authorities confirmed 
that they froze several bank accounts at the request of Russian 
investigators.

	BERLIN (AP) -- Germany's governing Social Democrats took their  
second beating in a week in local elections today, extending a 
string of setbacks for Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, according to 
preliminary results. The conservative Christian Democrats took 
about 51 percent of the vote in the eastern state of Thuringia, 
allowing them to end their alliance with the chancellor's Social 
Democrats and govern alone, according to television forecasts. The 
result it harder for Schroeder's center-left coalition to pass 
legislation, including a three-year austerity plan.

arrested in Germany on allegations that he swindled clients out of 
huge sums of money, has decided to fight his extradition to the 
United States, his lawyer said today. The move is likely to lead to 
weeks of extradition proceedings against Frankel, who has been held

greatest comebacks in their history today, overcoming a 21-point 
deficit in the fourth quarter and beating the Washington Redskins 
41-35 on Rocket Ismail's 76-yard touchdown catch in overtime. 
Ismail split the safeties and was wide open for Troy Aikman's fifth 
touchdown pass 4:09 into the extra period. Washington had a chance 
to win the game on the last play of regulation, but holder Matt 
Turk fumbled the snap on what would have been a 41-yard field-goal 
attempt by Brett Conway.

<HEADLINE>  Saints' Williams Hurt in 1st Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Ricky Williams' NFL debut was interrupted  
Sunday when his injured left ankle sent him to the sidelines and 
then to the locker room before halftime of the New Orleans Saints 
game against the Carolina Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who had eight carries for 37 yards in the first  
quarter, ran for 7 yards around the left end, then for 8 yards up 
the middle to close out the quarter. His 8-yard run gave New 
Orleans its only first down of the period, but sent Williams 
hopping off the field, favoring his injured left ankle. He was 
helped to the bench and his ankle retaped as worried coach Mike 
Ditka looked on. 
</P>
<P>
	The team announced that Williams again had a high ankle sprain  
and was questionable to return. But Williams took a couple of 
practice runs on the sideline, then drew a standing ovation as he 
trotted back into the lineup. He made only two more carries, 
however, the first for no gain, the second for 3 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams again started limping and was called off the field by  
the Saints trainer. After huddling with the trainer and team 
doctors, Williams was placed in a cart and taken to the locker room 
for X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams sustained a high sprain of his left ankle in the first  
preseason game but was cleared to play and returned this week.

<HEADLINE> Martin Runs Out of Gas at U.S. Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Slowly but surely, at the end of the biggest  
match of his life, Todd Martin just ran out of gas. 
</P>
<P>
	After winning a couple of tiebreak sets on Sunday, Martin was  
one set away from his first Grand Slam championship, leading Andre 
Agassi two sets-to-one in the best-of-five final at the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	But then it all fell apart.  
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest problem was I lost my legs a little bit,'' he  
said. ``When that happens, the serve is what goes. Then I started 
to try and force it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This five-setter turned out to be one too many marathons for  
Martin, who spent long hours on the courts at the National Tennis 
Center for the last two weeks. It was evident on changeovers when 
Agassi sprinted to his chair and Martin strolled to his. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt very good about the way I played,'' Martin said. ``I  
can't be disappointed with what happened today or over the last two 
weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twice, Martin was stretched to five sets, and twice he played  
four-setters. And that was in the early rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	He has a history of injuries and ailments -- elbow, knee, ankle,  
among others. In the end, all the extra games and sets caught up 
with him. ``It was cumulative,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I worked real hard to be up two sets to one. I knew I had to  
play well on my serve and better on his. Unfortunately, neither of 
those things happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was more than a tad short.''  
</P>
<P>
	During the trophy ceremony, he turned to Agassi and said:  
</P>
<P>
	``Andre, you played great. You deserved it. I couldn't think of  
a better way to go out than to play a great match against a great 
champion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi returned the compliment:  
</P>
<P>
	``I was very worried. He gave me a lot to worry about. He was  
executing in ways that were giving me all sorts of problems. He 
played so well, I felt I was hanging by a thread much of the 
match.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin was nearly washed out of the Open in the very first round  
when qualifier Stephane Huet forced him to a fifth-set tiebreaker. 
It was hardly an encouraging start. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you asked me two weeks ago after I beat Stephane, I wasn't  
too pleased about being here,'' Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gradually, that would change.  
</P>
<P>
	He went five sets against Greg Rusedski, losing the first two  
sets and then coming back from a 1-4 deficit in the fifth. He was 
on smelling salts during that match and afterward, needed to have 
his fluids replaced intravenously. His prospects were not great, 
but he kept finding a way to get through points and games. Then, 
suddenly, he was in the second final of his career, an opportunity 
that doesn't come along very often. 
</P>
<P>
	He played brilliant tennis for a while, especially in the second  
and third tiebreak sets. But he never could break Agassi, failing 
in eight attempts. And despite a blistering 23 aces, that failure 
eventually caught up with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't expect to go five sets without breaking his serve,''  
Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
	His consolation prize was a runner-up check of $420,000. He  
would have preferred the handsome silver winner's trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he had any goals for himself, Martin thought back of  
two brutal weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a goal of sleeping,'' he said.
