<HEADLINE> US Factory Orders Increase in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Orders to U.S. factories
increased by 0.2 percent to a record level in July following a big
gain in June, a sign that the U.S. economy grew at a brisk pace
this summer.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. commerce Department reported today that factory orders
advanced to a seasonally adjusted 330.3 billion dollars in July
followed a 1.7 percent jump in June.
</P>
<P>
The June's figure was revised up from an earlier estimate of
1.2 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
The increase of factory orders in the month resulted largely
from gains in non-durable goods. Orders for non-durable goods
increased 0.9 percent with food products, textiles and rubber and
plastic items seeing the biggest gains.
</P>
<P>
However, orders for durable goods -- items expected to last at
least three years -- fell 0.3 percent in July, the worst in seven
months.
</P>
<P>
The decline occurred not only in transportation but also in
electronic and electrical equipment. The volatile transportation
sector declined by 3.5 percent. An increase in orders for cars and
trucks wasn't enough to offset a decline in aircraft.
</P>
<P>
But orders rose 6.6 percent for industrial machinery, with
engines and turbines registering a 29.1 percent jump. Orders rose
3.7 percent for primary metals such as steel.
</P>
<P>
The backlog of unfilled orders decreased by 0.5 percent to a
seasonally adjusted 521.4 billion dollars, the first drop since
April.
</P>
<P>
Shipments, a measure of current production, rose 1.4 percent to
332.9 billion dollars. And inventories also increased by 0.5
percent to 447 billion dollars in the month.

<HEADLINE> No Signs of Frenchmen to Flood to Diana Funeral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- There is no sign that Frenchmen
and Frenchwomen will flood to attend the funeral of the late
Princess of Wales Diana Spencer at Westminster Abbey in London on
Saturday, said French railway, air and travel companies today.
</P>
<P>
The French state railway company SNCF told Agence France-Presse
(AFP) that the situation is "calm" and no supplementary Eurostar
train is planned for London this weekend.
</P>
<P>
Air France said that no special schedule is made, as the planes
for London are always fully ordered for the weekend as usual.
</P>
<P>
The Degriftour travel agency said that the number of tourists
for London is expected to increase between 12 percent and 15
percent, while the Public Tours agency, which is specialized in
trips to Britain, only expects a slight increase of tourists this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
The Nouvelle Frontieres air company said there is no increase
of orders from passengers to London, and the Havas Voyages which
is linked with the air company reported some cancellations because
some people cannot "stand the crowd".
</P>
<P>
France will be officially represented by its ambassador to
Britain, Jean Gueguinou, at the funeral of Diana.
</P>
<P>
The French first lady, Bernadette Chirac, former President
Giscard d'Estaing and his wife, Anne-Aymone, will attend the
funeral in private, according to AFP.

<HEADLINE> Suicide Jerusalem Attack Casts Shadow on Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 4 (Xinhua)-- Three suspected Hamas suicide
bombings ripped through a central Jerusalem pedestrian mall today
killing six people and wounding 160 others.
</P>
<P>
The terror attack cast shadow over the pending visit to the
Middle East by U.S. Secretary of State Medeleine Albright in an
effort to rescue the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The bombings went off around 3 p.m. local time (noon GMT) in
the bustling Ben Yehuda mall in downtown Jerusalem, barely one
kilometer away from the site of the twin bombings in Mahane Yehuda
market on July 30, in which 17 were killed and 170 others wounded.
</P>
<P>
Police supsected that three suicide bombers blew them up
outside a popular cafe in seconds apart. At least six were
killed, including three suicide bombers, and over 160 wounded in
th attack.
</P>
<P>
In an anonymous call to a French news agency, Hamas, the
Islamic Resistance Movement, claimed responsibility for the attack
as it did in the Mahane Yehuda bombings.
</P>
<P>
The group threatened to carry out more attacks unless Hamas
prisoiners held by Israel were released by September 14.
</P>
<P>
Although its authenticity is yet to be confimed, Israel reacted
strongly to the bombings by immediaitely reimposing a total
closure on the Palestinian self-rule territories of West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials quickly held the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) responsible for the attack, citing its refusal to
accept the Israeli demand to crack down hard on terrorism and
dismantle its infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
David Bar-Illan, adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, accusing PNA President Yasser Arafat of encouraging
terrorist attacks by "hugging and holding" a Hamas leader in a
Palestinian unity meeting not long ago.
</P>
<P>
For its part, the PNA condemned the bombings as criminal acts
amied at destroying the already deeply-troubled peace process, and
called on Israel to refrain from tightening sanctions against
Palestinians in the form of collective punishment.
</P>
<P>
Today's bombings came only days before Albright's arrival in
the region due on September 10 trying to bring new intiatives to
revive peace negotiations between Isreal and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
It is vividly reminicent to many people of the July 30 Mahane
Yehuda bombings, which took place on the eve of the arrival of
U.S. special envoy Dennis Ross, who subsequently put off his trip
for a week.

<HEADLINE> Chernomyrdin Urges Fight Against Tax-related Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin has called for a crack-down on tax-related crime.
</P>
<P>
At a government meeting today he said the central and local law
enforcement organs must take more positive and coordinated action
in tackling tax-related crimes, which directly threatened Russia's
economic security, the Inter-fax and Itar-Tass news agencies
reported.
</P>
<P>
The meeting severely censured the Federal Tax Police Bureau for
its inefficient work. The meeting was called to consider the role
of the bureau in fighting tax-related crimes.
</P>
<P>
Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais said the
situation in which taxation had failed to increase budget income
had not been reversed.
</P>
<P>
The state expenditure had been supported by income from
privatization and other items, said Chubais.
</P>
<P>
Anatoly Kulikov, Russian deputy prime minister and interior
minister, criticized the bureau for serious failings in appointing
leaders. He indicated that 20 chiefs of the central and local tax
police bureaus had been dismissed recently, including 10
generals.

<HEADLINE> Suicide Jerusalem Attack Casts Shadow on Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 4 (Xinhua)--
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the July 30 bombings, Israel imposed severe
sanctions against Palestinians, including a total closure, an
entry ban on Palestinian workers and freeze of tax revenues owed
to the PNA, to pressure the PNA to crack down on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
To pave the way for Albright's visit, Ross' four-day mediation
mission here early last month restored security ties between
Israel and the Palestinians with the presence of U.S. officials.
Palestinian police has cooperated with Israel in investigating the
July 30 bombings and in apprehending Palestinian criminals.
</P>
<P>
Israel in recent weeks reciprocated by gradually easing the
sanctions, releasing partially the frozen tax revenue funds and
allowing a limited number of Palestinian workers, merchants and
officials to enter Israel.
</P>
<P>
As Israel reinstituted the total closure and other sanctions
against Palestinians, the prospects for a breakthrough in during
Albright's visit seemed diminishing.
</P>
<P>
Both Israel and the PNA had been expecting Albright's visit in
hope of taking advantage of U.S. influence to pressure the other
side into making more compromises.
</P>
<P>
Israel demanded the PNA launch a long-term crackdown on terror
groups and their infrastructure, while the PNA insisted that
Israel firstly end the collective punishment of the Palestinian
people as a whole.
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of today's bombings, Israel is expected to
increase pressure on the PNA on the issue of fighting terrorism
and would be more reluctant to easing the sanctions. Local reports
said Netanyahu would hold an emergency cabinet meeting soon.
</P>
<P>
However, the sanctions may backfire because of mounting tension
between the two sides and the economic hardship they inflicted on
the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Central Bank Lowers Certificates Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Bank Indonesia, the country's
central bank, today lowered its one-month and three-month
short-term bilateral certificates (SBIS) rates by three percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
The Bank Indonesia said in a statement that the rate of the
month-long SBI was lowered from 30 percent to 27 percent, while
the rate for the three-month SBIS from 28 percent to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the SBI overnight rate remains at 15 percent, while
for one week the SBI rate is at 20 percent, two weeks at 22
percent, six months 12.125 percent, and one year remains at 12.75
percent.
</P>
<P>
The central bank raised its one month SBI rate to 30 percent
and its three-month SBI rate to 28 percent on August 19.
</P>
<P>
The rate increase was aimed at stabilizing the rupiah currency
against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
To curb the rupiah fluctuation, the government introduced a
tight monetary policy and raised the SBI rates along with the
temporary halt of the purchase money market securities (SBPUS) by
the central bank.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the lowering of SBI rates aims to show
the government's promise to relax the tight money policy in
stages.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad said on Wednesday that to
prevent the currency turmoil from leading to an economic crisis,
Indonesia needs to take credible proactive measures that will
anticipate future problems.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the rupiah continued to lose ground despite the
package of measures announced Wednesday by the finance minister.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah fell to 3,030/3,040 against the U.S. dollar at
mid-afternoon trading today.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has fallen more than 10 percent in the past month
and nearly 23 percent since January following offshore speculative
attacks on the currency and a rush by local companies to hedge
their foreign borrowings.

<P>
The two corvettes are equipped with advanced weapons systems
and radar, with a range of up to 180 kilometers, and have four
missile launchers and sonar for detecting submarines, he said.

BRUSSELS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- A European Parliament
committee is seeking a debate on action at European Union (EU)
level to curb press intrusion, following the death of Princess
Diana in a car crash in Paris last weekend.

"The question of how to strike a balance between freedom of

She noted that the issue had become an international problem
which required attention at an international level.
</P>
<P>
"Diana was a powerful, compassionate force for changing
attitudes, most recently in her crusade against landmines. We owe
it to her memory to reflect on attitudes towards privacy," she

CAIRO, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
condemned the suicide bomb explosions in central Jerusalem a few
hours ago which killed at least six people and injured 165 others.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the press today, Mubarak called upon the
concerned parties to exercise self restraint during these
difficult circumstances.
</P>
<P>
The terror blasts, aimed at innocent civilians, only led to
further complication of the critical situation and posed
obstruction to the peace process in the region, Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
"I reiterate that the best method to address acts of terrorism
and bloodshed is to proceed forward with the peace process, and
that all parties adhere to their signed agreements," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak affirmed that resorting to collective punishment
against Palestinians would further fuel tension and complicate the
situation.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the explosion, Israel reimposed the total
closure of the Palestinian self-rule territories of West Bank and
Gaza Strip.

<HEADLINE> New Peace Initiatives Despite Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 4 (Xinhua) -- There are new peace
initiatives by senior Rahanwein clan delegates and officials from
Hussein Aidid's government despite severe and sporadic guerrilla
hit and run fighting between the forces of Hussein Mohamed Aidid
and the Rahanwein Resistance Army, RRA, in the southwestern
regions of Bay and Bakol.
</P>
<P>
A top level delegation led by Sheikh Mukhtar Mohamed Hussein,
an 85 year old and well respected Rahanwein elder, and Mr Abdi
Warsame Issak, a minister from Hussein Aidid's government, have
left for Bay and Bakol regions this week in an attempt of
pacifying the warring sides battling over the control of Baidoa
and Huddor.
</P>
<P>
The delegation of Sheikh Mukhtar, the former spokesman of
Somalia's first civilian parliament, encouraged by Hussein
Mohamed Aidid have already been meeting elders and intellectuals
from the Rahanwein communities in the towns of Bay and Huddor
since Monday this week. Radio South Mogadishu supporting Hussein
Mohamed Aidid which spoke about the new peace initiatives has
characterized these meetings as a step forward in pacifying the
brothers.
</P>
<P>
There are also reports making the whole peace process as
controversial. Representatives from the Rahanwein Resistance Army
in north Mogadishu have characterized the peace efforts backed by
Hussein Aidid as nonsense. A spokesman for the RRA, Mr Mohamed
Ali Aden Qalinle, said there can be no peace in these regions as
long as Hussein Aidid's men are in control of the towns of Baidoa
and Bakol.
</P>
<P>
Mr Qalinle said the efforts of Sheikh Mukhtar can bring about
no fruits since he's not independent for his moves and decisions
as he put it. Mr Qalinle furthermore said his faction doesn't
oppose to mediation, "we welcome any peace initiative launched by
the neutral clans of Somalia," said Mr Qalinle.
</P>
<P>
The sporadic fighting which claimed the lives of many and
displaced hundreds of families from these two regions had
likewise been making nervous the faction led by Hussein Mohamed
Aidid, especially the guerrilla fighting in the area of Baidoa
which is vital for the safety and control of the only tarmac
airport, Ballidogle.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Trade volume between Syria
and Egypt in 1996 rose to 252 million Egyptian pounds (about 74
million U.S. dollars), according to the Egyptian Embassy here
today.
</P>
<P>
This was about 88 percent up from five years ago when the
figure stood at 134 million pounds (about 39 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
A breakdown of last year's trade volume showed that Syrian
exports register at 52 million pounds (about 15 million dollars)
and Egyptian exports to Syria 200 million pounds (about 59 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
An Egyptian commercial attache who was here attending the

Egypt include tobacco, lintel, spices and certain plants.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is exporting to Syria rice, oil, lubricants, tourist
buses, medicine and chemicals, he added.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed by the two countries in 1961, 19
Syrian and 20 Egyptian commodities are exempt from customs duties.
</P>
<P>
Egypt sent 57 companies to take part in the ongoing

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Embargo on S. Leone Illegal, Junta Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's military junta
today made its first official response to the economic embargo
enforced by west African countries, saying that the move lacked
legal basis.
</P>
<P>
The sub-regional leaders decided at a summit last week to
impose economic sanctions and embargo on Sierra Leone as a means
to force the junta to give up power it seized in the May 25 coup.
</P>
<P>
But a spokesman of the junta denied the resolution, saying
that the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) had
no responsibility to do so.
</P>
<P>
"The only body that is responsible to establish sanctions is
the United Nations Security Council. What the ECOWAS has to do is
to make recommendations," the spokesman said, quoted by the
British Broadcasting Corporation.
</P>
<P>
"The UN has not met. Nothing has been established. And it is
the responsibility of the government, which is a responsible
government, to take care of life and property," he said.
</P>
<P>
The coup in Sierra Leone has invited unanimous condemnation of
the international community. ECOWAS has sent troops there in an
attempt to restore the legitimate government ousted in the coup.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between ECOWAS and the junta broke down at the
end of July when the junta announced to remain in power until the
year 2001.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS heads of state met at a summit last weekend in Abuja,
Nigeria and decided to enforce economic sanctions and embargo on
the troubled country in a bid to force the junta to step down.
</P>
<P>
While the junta is reportedly looking for ways to re-open
talks with ECOWAS, the Nigerian military warned Wednesday that
the coupists were planning to launch offensive attack on troops
sent to Sierra Leone by ECOWAS.
</P>
<P>
The junta also accused the sub-regional troops of shelling
civilian targets in Freetown in the past 40 hours, killing 50
civilians with 17 seriously wounded.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Junta Accuses ECOMOG of Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The military junta in Sierra
Leone today accused th west African peacekeeping force (ECOMOG)
of discriminate shelling that killed civilians.
</P>
<P>
A series of bombardment by ECOMOG troops left "50 dead and 17
seriously wounded", said a spokesman of the junta, quoted by the
British Broadcasting Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Accusing ECOMOG troops of continuous bombarding for the past
40 hours, the spokesman particularly mentioned three that took
place at midnight Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Three shells landed yesterday (night), one at 11:30, one at
11:45 and one 7:30 this morning," which led to the death and
injuries on innocent civilians, said the spokeman of the Armed
Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC), Sierra Leone's current
supreme governing body.
</P>
<P>
AFRC, led by Major Johnny Koroma, was set up after the May 25
coup that toppled the legitimate government of ousted President
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG was dispatched to the Sierra Leonean capital of
Freetown in the wake of the coup in an attempt to restore
Kabbah's government.
</P>
<P>
Repeated clashes have been reported between the ECOMOG troops
and AFRC soldiers.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG now still holds the Lungi international airport near
Freetown, where the alleged bombardment was launched.
</P>
<P>
However, ECOMOG Force Commander Major-General Victor Malu has
denied the accusation, saying: "We are not firing any civilian
position" in an area in Freetown whose name he did not known.
</P>
<P>
"Any firing that you know in Sierra Leone is done because we
fire upon and we have to return fire at the motion of getting our
defensive," Malu said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a demonstration against ECOMOG allegedly led by
Nigeria was staged by civilians in Freetown today.
</P>
<P>
According to a BBC report, many demonstrators were waving
banners and singing songs in support of the AFRC administration.
</P>
<P>
They appealed to the international community and the United
Nations to help put a stop to what they called "Nigerians are
kept to make Sierra Leone a puppet state".
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was prompted by the report of shelling by
the ECOMOG troops based in the Lungi international airport,
according to the BBC.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's NCEC Announces Strikes, Demonstrations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's opposition umbrella
body, the National Convention Executive Council (NCEC), today
called national strikes and demonstrations in a bid to increase
pressure on the government for constitutional reforms.
</P>
<P>
The countrywide strikes and demonstrations were scheduled for
September 17, September 18, October 8 and October 9, NCEC senior
member Willy Mutunga said at a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
He said the NCEC, set up in April to coordinate the
opposition's reform campaign, is also to hold a rally in Kisumu,
ashore Lake Victoria as the third-largest city in the country, on
Sunday and here on October 10, a public holiday.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, now aged 73
and in power since 1978, makes a public speech on October 10
annually.
</P>
<P>
"NCEC calls upon Kenyans to prepare themselves for protracted
and intensified mass action," said Mutunga, claiming that only
pressure from people could force the government towards political
changes for so-called fair and free elections.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that "we must emphasize that mass action
does not mean violence. Those who engage in disruptive violence,
looting and other unlawful acts are agent provocateurs and
anti-reform."
</P>
<P>
One day earlier, the NCEC dismissed the inter-parties
parliamentary group talks on reforms dialogue among members of
parliament from both the ruling Kenya African National Union and
opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 parliamental members held a meeting last
Thursday and resolved to form a 13-member inter-parties
parliamentary body to replace NCEC to spearhead reform talks
between KANU and the opposition.
</P>
<P>
But NCEC charged that the Kenyan parliament does not represent
all Kenyan people as KANU enjoys an absolute majority.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, KANU reiterated it will not hold dialogue with the
NCEC as the latter is unregistered, insisting that the reform
talks should only be undertaken within legal framework.
</P>
<P>
KANU will open its National Delegate Conference on September
16 over reform talks and the forthcoming general elections. At
the KANU conference before the first multi-party election in
1992, Moi was elected as KANU's sole presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
Political atmosphere has been tightening in the eastern
African country following several rounds of violent clashes
between the government and the opposition since May, the key loan
cut by the International Monetary Fund and killings on the Coast.
</P>
<P>
Moi has recently claimed that he would soon announce the poll
date.

<HEADLINE> Beira Corridor Group to Be Wound Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Beira Corridor Group (BCG)
will wind up its operations at the end of the year as members
feel the organisation has successfully fulfilled its mandate, the
Zimbabwe News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Beira Corridor is a railway and road network running between
the Zimbabwean eastern border town of Mutare to the Mozambican
port city of Beira.
</P>
<P>
BCG chairman John Laurie said on Wednesday members had
unanimously agreed to close it down at the firm's annual general
meeting held in Harare in August.
</P>
<P>
Formed as a business sector lobby in 1986, BCG's original
mandate was to ensure the Beira Corridor was available to
importers and exporters as an alternative to south African
routes.
</P>
<P>
"BCG's 280 member companies, mostly from Zimbabwe, made it
clear at the annual general meeting that they felt this objective
had been amply achieved, and that the Beira Corridor had indeed
become an economic and efficient alternative to the more distant
and more expensive south African port," said Laurie in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Laurie said with the successful launching of the Maputo
Development Corridor early in 1996, BCG spearheaded efforts to
transform the focus of the Beira Corridor from a transport route
into a development corridor."
</P>
<P>
"The concept of a development corridor, based on the fact that
there already exists a sound infrastructural spine, required the
establishment of a formal government and business sector
structure designed to remove impediments to investment and trade,
and to stimulate increased investor interest," said Laurie.

<HEADLINE> Israel Continues Preparing for Albright's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Despite today's suicide
bombings in Jerusalem, Israel is continuing preparing for the
visit to the region by United States Secretary Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it is continuing
contact with Israeli Embassy in Washington and the U.S. Embassy in
Tel Aviv on arranging Albright's mission.
</P>
<P>
Three powerful bomb explosions ripped through central
Jerusalem's Ben Yehuda pedestrian mall at 3 p.m. local time (noon
GMT), claiming at least seven people and injuring 165 others.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government is reportedly reconsidering Albright's trip
to the Middle East in the wake of the attack, partly because of
the seven-day mourning period for the victims in Israel.
</P>
<P>
But she is expected to proceed with the much-awaited trip,
which will focus on rescuing the deeply-troubled
Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the ministry had briefed all Israeli
diplomatic missions abroad on today's bombings, in a bid to win
international support for Israeli stance on fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Israeli militant group Islamic Resistance Movement
(Hamas) claimed responsibility for the attack as it did in the
previous one on July 30 when two suicide bombings went off in
Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market, not far away from today's site,
killing 17 people and wounding 170 others.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Cabinet Secretary Abdel
Rahman condemned the attackers for trying to prevent Albright's
visit. He also offered to resume full security cooperation with
Israel in fighting terrorism, a condition set by Israel for
restarting the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In response to the bombing attack, Israel immediately reimposed
the total closure of the Palestinian self-rule territories of West
Bank and Gaza Strip, which has been partially eased in recent
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials strongly denounced the PNA for failing to
respond to the Israeli demand on cracking down on terrorism, and
held it responsible for the attack.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, during a visit to
the wounded in a hospital, said that unless the PNA changed its
attitude toward the terrorism, the peace process cannot continue.
</P>
<P>
"We will not continue on this route of periodic bouts of
terrorism," vowed Netanyahu, who is to consult with senior
security officials tonight to formulate further reaction to the
attack.

<HEADLINE>                  Three Photographers Surrender to Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Three photographers today
surrendered to police for having chased the Mercedes car of the
late Princess of Wales Diana Spencer last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The photographers, who knew that they had been recognized by
police, went to the police ``simultaneously'' and are now detained
by police, said Agence France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
Identified as employees of two specialized photo agencies, they
could be brought to a judge for questioning in a second step of
the legal proceeding.
</P>
<P>
Six photographers and one press motorcyclist were put under
judicial investigation on Tuesday by Judge Herve Stephan of the
Paris Investigation Court for ``involuntary homicide and
involuntary injury'' and ``non-assistance to persons in danger''
in a traffic accident which killed Diana, her friend Egyptian
millionaire Dodi al Fayed and their chauffeur Henri Paul.
</P>
<P>
AFP quoted investigators of the anti-riot Criminal Brigade of
the French Police Force as saying that they have found ``a
succession of extremely grave, coordinating and sad events'' which
are linked to the accident.
</P>
<P>
The Criminal Brigade said that some photographers could have
taken pictures of Diana injured in the accident and then fled away
before the arrival of police agents, as they have seized some
photos ``ready to be sold in the market'' by photo agencies.
</P>
<P>
Laurent Sola, the boss of the LS Press Agency which is a target
of police, said he sold the pictures within five hours after
the accident took place.
</P>
<P>
Police are continuing to investigate the situation around the
departure of Diana from the Ritz Hotel, which they described as
being under ``the climate of precipitation of tension'' at that
time.
</P>
<P>
Police found that Henri Paul, the 41-year-old security
assistant chief of the hotel who drove the Mercedes, was drunk and
that he did not qualify for the job of driving the super-powerful
limousine.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Satisfied with German's Position: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus today expressed
satisfaction with statement by German's Foreign Minister
Klaus Kinkel on Cyprus' prospects for accession to the European
Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Manolis Christofides made the statement
at his daily press briefing here after Kinkel held a meeting with
his visiting Cypriot counterpart Ioannis Kasoulides in Bonn
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel was quoted as saying after the meeting that Cyprus-EU
accession talks will begin as agreed, six months after the end of
the Intergovernmental Conference.
</P>
<P>
However, he told Kasoulides that "it is to Cyprus' benefit to
have the northern part of the island (Turkish Cypriots) involved
in all negotiations held."
</P>
<P>
The German foreign minister said his country will contribute
toward efforts to defuse tensions between Greece and Turkey, a
factor he described as important to reaching a settlement in
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel said he will discuss the issue in the upcoming talks he
will have with his Turkish counterpart Ismail Cem and Turkish
Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus applied for full EU membership in 1990. The EU
reaffirmed its decision in July that accession talks with Cyprus
will begin early next year.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.N.-sponsored two rounds of direct talks between
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash in the U.S. and Switzerland in the past two months
ended in failure because the Turkish Cypriot side refused to
further negotiate a settlement unless the EU postpones the
accession talks with Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel expressed regret over the fact that the U.N.-sponsored
direct talks were not successful and stressed that "the momentum
of these talks cannot be lost."
</P>
<P>
The German minister said he has accepted an invitation from
his Cypriot counterpart to visit the island in spring.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Kasoulides reiterated the Cypriot president's
dedication to negotiations for a settlement to the Cyprus
problem, saying that the Cyprus government considers the
island's entry into the EU as "absolutely necessary" in order to
achieve a speedy solution to the political problem.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unresolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after Turkey sent its troops and took over the
northern third of the island in the wake of a failed coup seeking
union with Greece.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Unplanned development
in Dar es Salaam is one of the major factors that incapacitate
the City Commission from keeping the environment clean.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made here today by Richard Msingi, City
Commission Sustainable Coordinator, at a three-day consultive
meeting on the City Health Plan.
</P>
<P>
Msingi said that influx of people from other regions has
caused an increase of population to an extent that the city fails
to provide baisc environmental services.
</P>
<P>
The population of Dar es Salaam is 2.3 million now, compared
to 1.4 milion in 1988. The population growth rate is about 7
percent per annum.
</P>
<P>
The City Commission has taken measures to improve the social
sector, which include emergence-clean up campaigns, improvement
of the work of hospitals, health centers and dispensaries through
the Urban Health Project program and anti-malaria control
program.
</P>
<P>
However, Msingi said, social services in the city are still in
pathetic situation as the population growth rate is not
proportional to the available socio-economic services since the
city's economic growth rate is lower.
</P>
<P>
Msingi cited another factor as underfinancing. He appealed to
interested donors for supplement its efforts to improve the
city's environment.

LUANDA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Namibian Defense Minister
Honoravel Malina said here today that the problem of arms

</P>
<P>
Malina made the statement upon arriving at the airport

</P>
<P>
Weapon smuggling in the border area is a very touchy issue for
leaders of both countries, he noted, as it is very difficult to
know whether organized groups are involved.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister admitted that part of the reasons for the
current situation is the civil wars in the two countries for the
recent years.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Angola, Malina will work together with
Angolan leaders to settle various problems concerning on common

ANKARA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Turkish police detained 21
pro-Kurdish activists, including 18 foreigners, in the largest
city of Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
A police statement said these people were taken into custody
when they tried to hold a press conference in defiance of a

<P>
Two diplomats from Italy and Britain in Ankara were set free
afterwards, the police said.

The foreigners are from Denmark, Spain, Germany, Italy and

by pro-Kurdish Europeans.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government tried to block the plan, but some
activists managed their way into Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Kurdish issue is a long-standing problem puzzling the

condemned in the strongest possible terms this appalling act of
violence.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the U.N. chief was convinced it was time for
the Israelis and the Palestinians to sit together and to take
stock of the situation on the ground and in their negotiations, to
decide what could be done to prevent violence, address its causes,
and do everything possible to restart the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Three explosions went off in the heart of downtown Jerusalem
Thursday morning. The military wing of the militant Islamic
group has claimed responsibility for the attack.

<HEADLINE> Sit-in in Beirut for Detainees In Israeli Jails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese National Committee of
Detainees in Israeli Jails today staged a sit-in in front of the
Beirut office of the International Red Cross Committee (IRCC) in a
sign of support for Lebanese detainees in Israeli prisons.
</P>
<P>
The Labenese National News Agency quoted the president of the
committee Mohammed Oubeid as saying that the release of Lebanese
detainees in Israeli prisons has become a part of the struggle
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The current task for the committee is to call on the
international community such as IRCC to further press Israel to
improve the detainees' conditions in prisons, and allow all
international human rights organizations to visit prisons and
witness what is goning on, he added.
</P>
<P>
meanwhile, he called on Israel to immediately release the
diseased, women and children from its jails and allow a medical
team to enter and check health of the others.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued by the committee said the Lebanese
detainees in Israeli prisons are suffering from various mental
and physical tortures, including electrical hit, continuous hit by
electrical wire, hanging on the pillar under the burning sun in
summer and in the rain.
</P>
<P>
Since Israel established a 1,100-square-kilometer "security
zone" in south Lebanon in 1985 to buffer attacks by Islamic
militants on northern Israel, it has set up several prisons to
detain those who refuse obedience to Israel or cooperate with them.
</P>
<P>
The Khiam Detention Camp, the biggest one, now reportedly holds
about 140 Lebanese detainees.

WASHINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton on
Thursday condemned bombings at a downtown Jerusalem shopping mall,
saying it was not "tolerated."
</P>
<P>
Speaking from his vacation resort in Martha's Vineyard, Mass.,
Clinton declared that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright would
go as scheduled to the Middle East next week and would take with
her the message "that terror will not be tolerated."
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that the perpetrators of this attack intended to
kill both innocent people and the peace process itself. They must
not be allowed to succeed," Clinton said at a hastily arranged
news conference.
</P>
<P>
He said he was certain an overwhelming majority of Palestinians
and Israelis "yearn for an end to violence and for the start of
lasting peace."
</P>
<P>
"Everything possible must be done to stop them. The peace
process can only move forward in a secure environment," he said,
adding "this is a message that Secretary Albright will emphasize
when she travels to the region next week."

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Welcomes Greek Defense Minister's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government
welcomed today Greek Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos'
statement that Turkey's attempted strike at Russian anti-aircraft
missiles in Cyprus would cause war.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Manolis Christofides made the remark at
his daily press briefing while commenting on the Greek minister's
statement during his visit to London.
</P>
<P>
The Greek minister said in an interview over London Greek Radio
that the Cyprus problem is not Turkey's internal problem and
threats have no place and are rejected not only by Greece and
Cyprus, but by the entire international community.
</P>
<P>
On how Greece reacts to Turkey's threats to attack the S-300
missiles, the minister said "I would advise our neighbor not
to slide along dangerous avenues to manipulating foreign
matters."
</P>
<P>
Referring to what Greece would do in case Turkey follows
through with its threats, Tsohatzopoulos reiterated that the
joint defense pact between Greece and Cyprus is there to be
implemented. Any attack by Turkey against Cyprus is casus belli,
the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus signed an agreement with Russia early this year to
purchase S-300 missile systems in an effort to defend its
military bases. The delivery of the missiles is expected to be
done by autumn next year.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has repeatedly threatened to strike them once they are
installed in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Under a joint defense pact agreed by the governments of Cyprus
and Greece in 1993, Greece will come to aid of Cyprus if the
island is attacked militarily.
</P>
<P>
Athens has warned Ankara that any further advance of the
Turkish troops toward the Cypriot government-controlled southern
part of the island would mean war between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Greek defense minister expressed the hope that
the peace process in Cyprus bears fruit and direct negotiations
between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides aimed at solving the
Cyprus problem will continue following the Cyprus presidential
elections early next year.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO allies, are at odds over this
eastern Mediterranean island, which has been divided since 1974
when Turkey sent troops and took over 37 percent of the island in
the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Greece.

</P>
<P>
He made it clear that this atrocity "makes it all the more
important for the Israelis and Palestinians to return to full
dialogue and to cooperate in the fight against terrorism so that

a sustaining economic growth in the region, reported Zambia News
Agency (ZANA).
</P>
<P>
Alfred Nzo, Chairman of the SADC council of ministers, made
the statement at the council's meeting which opened this morning
in Blantyre, Malawi.
</P>
<P>
Nzo, also South African foreign minister, said that SADC had
provided the frame work to sustain economic growth in the region
and all member states should apply themselves to these
challenges.
</P>
<P>
The region's gross domestic product has jumped by more than 6
percent since the inception of the Southern African Development
Co-ordination Conference (SADCC), he noted, urging that the rate
be consolidated by promoting the social sector in the region.
</P>
<P>
The council chairman elaborated that the agricultural sector
did very well in the last farming season when the region recorded
17.4 million tons of maize despite of serious floods.
</P>
<P>
The SADC council of ministers are also expected to recommend
the adoption of a declaration of the ban on anti-personnel mines
to the forthcoming SADC summit to be held Monday.
</P>
<P>
The SADC council will also consider the applications from the
Seychelles and the Democratic Republic of Congo which have

<HEADLINE> Jordan Condemns New Explosions in Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Jordan condemned today's suicide
bomb explosions in downtown West Jerusalem that killed at least
seven people, including three suspected Hamas bombers, and wounded
165 others.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's King Hussein made a telephone call this evening to
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to condemn the bombings,
saying Jordan is against such a terrorist action.
</P>
<P>
The king hoped that the new explosions would not adversely
affect the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The explosions were plotted by a small number of
fundamentalists who wanted to ruin the peace which was just what
most people wanted, the king said over the phone.
</P>
<P>
The previous explosions took place in Jerusalem on July 30
killing 17 people and injuring 170 others, devastating the peace
process which has been stalled since Israel broke ground for the
building of a controversial Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem in
March.
</P>
<P>
Today`s explosions prompted the Israeli government to reimpose
the total closure on West Bank and Gaza Strip which has been
partially eased during the past weeks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jordanian Minister of State for Information Affairs
Samir Mutawe released a statement to condemn the suicide terror
attack.

not be the victim of terrorism too,'' said Chirac.

He said that the only response to terrorism is to ``relaunch
the peace process with determination.''

``That will allow, I am convinced, to ensure to all sides

<HEADLINE> Over 27,000 UNITA Forces Demobilized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Minister of Assistance
and Reinsertation Albina Malungo said today that over 27,000
militiamen of the former rebel movement National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) have been demobilized.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement to the press after attending the meeting
of the Joint Commission on Angolan Peace Process.
</P>
<P>
The commission was satisfactory about the progress of UNITA's
"quick demobilization", Malungo noted, adding that the
demobilized fighters are now forbidden to leave the assembly
area.
</P>
<P>
However, he believed that the issue could only be completely
solved when national authorities are re-established in all the
areas occupied by UNITA.
</P>
<P>
The issue was discussed Wednesday by the joint commission,
after which its spokesman Higino Carneiro said, since the work
was restored at the end of August, only 31 of the total 100 areas
occupied by UNITA was facilitated with national authorities. He
blamed UNITA for setting up obstacles to the task, and denounced
the rebel movement for it.
</P>
<P>
Owing to the pressure from the international community and
mediations from various sectors, the Angolan Peace Process which
was halted for as long as four months, has again made progress,
with the renewed demobilization of UNITA militiamen and the
re-establishment of national authorities in UNITA-occupied areas,
although the pace has been very slow.

<HEADLINE> Turkey's Welfare Party Facing Closure Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's Constitutional Court
decided today to grant the pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP) an
extra month to prepare its defense against closure charges.
</P>
<P>
With additional 30 days, RP, led by Turkey's former prime
minister Necmettin Erbakan, is to submit its defense statement to
the Court before October 6.
</P>
<P>
On August 6, the pro-Islamic Party asked the Constitutional
Court for an extra 60 days to complete its defense statement.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Chief Prosecutor Vural Savas filed in May a closure
case against RP with Turkey's supreme judicial organ on the
grounds that it supports Islamic fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
According to Turkish law, Erbakan and other senior RP
officials would be barred from politics for five years if their
Party were closed down.
</P>
<P>
It is rumored that Erbakan might resign from RP to avoid being
shut out of political life. But it was denied and put as
"groundless" by RP deputy chairman Sevket Kazan.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan has been criticized for not curbing the expanding
fundamentalism in this secular country during his tenure as prime
minister before June 18 when the Turkish military forced him to
resign.

PARIS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- A court in the northeastern
French city of Metz put on trial this week 26 drug traffickers,
including 16 Turkish nationals, who are described as extremely
violent and had smuggled 150 kilograms of heroin from Turkey to
France and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Public Prosecutor Brigitte Garrigues today recommended 10 years
of jail against the heads of the ring, and nine years to six
months of jail against their accomplices, plus 94.01 million
francs (about 15 million U.S. dollars) of fines, reported Agence

<P>
She also suggested a banning of the 16 Turkish nationals of the

French police broke the ring in November 1995 after Jean Marc

<HEADLINE> Brady Law Prevents 173,000 Handgun Sales in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- A new analysis by the U.S.
Justice Department shows the Brady Bill has prevented 173,000
illegal handgun sales since it was enacted in February 1994.
</P>
<P>
About 70,000 sales were blocked in 1996 alone, and overall, the
bill has kept 250,000 firearms of all types out of the hands of
felons, the mentally ill and other unqualified potential
gun-owners.
</P>
<P>
An earlier report by the department's Bureau of Justice
Statistics, "Presale Firearms Checks," estimated that 6,600
applications for firearms of all types were rejected by dealers
each month between the advent of Brady background checks and July
1997.
</P>
<P>
The Brady law requires federally-licensed dealers to submit
handgun purchase applications for background checks on the buyers.
</P>
<P>
The law is named after former press secretary James Brady, who
was seriously wounded in the assassination attempt on the then
President Ronald Reagan. It was passed in 1993 after bitter
congressional battles and was strongly opposed by the National
Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
Last June, the Supreme Court ruled the federal government could
not order the states to perform the background checks. Almost all
states, however, continue to check voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
Last year, dealers throughout the United States obtained
background checks on almost 2.6 million handgun applications --
about 2.7 percent were rejected.
</P>
<P>
About 47,000 handgun sales were rejected because applicants had
been indicted or convicted of felonies; 4,200 because buyers were
fugitives from justice; 3,900 because the buyers were excluded
under state laws; 2,700 because the buyers were under court
restraining orders; and 1,000 because the buyers were mental
patients.
</P>
<P>
The rest were blocked for various reasons: some were juveniles,
others were illegal aliens or dishonorably discharged armed
services members.

<HEADLINE> Germany Sees Record Number of Bankruptcies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The number of corporate
bankruptcies in Germany reached a new record in the first half of
1997 despite increasing signs indicating that the country's
economic recovery is well underway, official figures showed today.
</P>
<P>
According to data released today by the Federal Statistics
Office in Wiesbaden, there were 2,620 corporate bankruptcies
reported in June, up 25.5 percent from the level a year ago. The
most dramatic increase was registered in eastern Germany, where
corporate bankruptcies shot up 44 percent from the same month last
year.
</P>
<P>
With the June figures, the number of corporate bankruptcies in
Germany in the first half of 1997 reached 13,598, up 8.8 percent
on the same period last year. The eastern half of Germany reported
4,033 bankruptcies in the first six months, a increase of 11.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the latest bankruptcy figures were an indication
that the current export-driven economic upswing in Germany had
benefited mainly large companies. The numerous small and
medium-sized companies in the country were increasingly at a
disadvantage to compete with low-labor-cost nations on the world
market.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Accuses S. Leonean Junta of Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria today accused of the
military junta in Sierra Leone of launching offensive attack on
the positions of west African peacekeeping force (ECOMOG) there,
resulting in the deaths of many civilians.
</P>
<P>
A Defense Headquarters statement said a lot of civilian
casualties have been reported today as sporadic fire was used
against innocent citizens and ECOMOG positions in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
"Following a meeting of the Sierra Leonean junta and the
military commanders yesterday, the junta early today launched an
offensive against the ECOMOG troops and innocent citizens," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
It also accused the junta of planting landmines, saying that
it is shame to do so "while the world over is condemning the use
of landmines."
</P>
<P>
The statement came after the junta's accusation earlier today
of shells fired by ECOMOG at midnight Wednesday that killed 50
civilians and seriously wounded 17 in the Sierra Leone capital of
Freetown.
</P>
<P>
However, ECOMOG Force Commander Victor Malu has denied the
accusation, saying that ECOMOG did not fire any "civilian
population area".
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG troops were sent to Sierra Leone following the May 25
coup that ousted the legitimate government led by President Ahmed
Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Exchange of fires between ECOMOG troops and soldiers loyal to
the junta has been reported.
</P>
<P>
As the junta refused the international demand to step down
with a four-year transition plan, west African leaders last week
ordered ECOMOG to enforce sanctions and embargo on the troubled
country to try to dislodge the junta.
</P>
<P>
"The embargo is already in force," said Malu, adding that
ECOMOG will ensure the agreement will not be violated.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that two container ships tried to berth at the
port in Freetown this morning, inviting shells fired by ECOMOG
troops in an unsuccessful attempt to deter them from coming to
port and unloading rice and other foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
The shells went astray and killed a number of civilians, a
report said.
</P>
<P>
At three of the waterside areas hit, dead animals, rubble from
struck houses and utensils littered the ground, it said.
</P>
<P>
But Malu refuted the report, saying: "We can employ any means
to enforce the embargo. But it's particular for the junta to say
that we are bombarding and missing the target."
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, a spokesman of the junta said the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) did not have the right
to declare sanctions and embargo on the country.
</P>
<P>
"The only body that is responsible to establish sanctions is
the United Nations Security Council. What the ECOWAS has to do is
to make recommendations," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The UN has not met. Nothing has been established. And it is
the responsibility of the government, which is a responsible
government, to take care of life and property," he added.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that junta reacted to the resolution
passed at the 20th ECOWAS summit last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, people in Freetown are reportedly marching to the
national stadium to mourn the dead in the bombardment.
</P>
<P>
The junta spokesman said they carried about 20 corps for the
funeral and one of the bodies was put in front of the United
Nations building.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- BBC World, the BBC's 24-hour
news and information channel, will bring live and complete
coverage of the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales, Saturday to
viewers all over the world.
</P>
<P>
Announcing in a press release, BBC World said today that the
audience in over 180 countries and territories will join with the
BBC's millions of viewers across the United Kingdom for live
coverage of the service in Westminster Abbey at the heart of
London.
</P>
<P>
The BBC's cameras will also follow the funeral procession
through the streets of London from St James' Palace, where the
Princess' body has lain in the Royal Chapel since being returned
from Paris Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The processional route of the Princess's coffin to her funeral
in Westminster Abbey is to be extended after the personal
intervention of the Prince of Wales.
</P>
<P>
It was reported the Prince feared that the many thousands
expected to pour into London Saturday would be denied access to
what promises to be an unprecedented show of national emotion.
</P>
<P>
A minute's silence will be observed following the funeral.
Then, viewers will see the procession travel from Westminster
Abbey to a tiny village church close to Diana's family home of
Althorp House, in the English countryside, for a private burial,
according to BBC World.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Create Viruses Against AIDS Virus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The first virus-killing
viruses that can enter AIDS-infected cells and destroy them have
been created by scientists, according to the U.S. medical
journal of Cell.
</P>
<P>
The approach, which works well in the test tube but has not
been tried yet in people or even animals, is to fight infection
with infection, said reports in the journal, which is to be
published Friday.
</P>
<P>
The newly created viruses target only cells that have already
been captured by HIV or the AIDS virus, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
"It's absolutely amazing that you can make a virus that will
specifically target HIV-infected cells," said Ronald Desrosiers of
the New England Regional Primate Center, who plans to begin
testing one of the viruses soon on monkeys.
</P>
<P>
One version of the virus, created by Dr. John K. Rose and his
research team at Yale Medical School, is a genetically altered
form of vesicular stomatitis virus, or VSV, a bug that ordinarily
infects livestock.
</P>
<P>
Another is based on the rabies virus and was created by a team
led by Dr. Karl-Klaus Conzelmann of the Federal Research Center
for Virus Diseases of Animals in Tubingen, Germany.
</P>
<P>
"It's a completely new approach to limiting viral infection,"
Rose said. "This is the first virus that's an anti-virus."
</P>
<P>
Dr. Garry Nolan of Stanford University called the success
"highly significant" and "a leap forward" in the fight against
AIDS disease.

<HEADLINE> Albright Mideast Trip Unchanged Despite Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton said
today that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright would go to the
Middle East next week as originally scheduled despite a bombing at
a downtown Jerusalem shopping mall this morning, killing at least
eight people and injuring more than 150.
</P>
<P>
"It's all the more important for Secretary Albright to go. It's
important she go right on out there, and we keep pushing this
thing," Clinton said at his vacation resort in Martha's Vineyard,
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
He said the bombings added a new sense of urgency to Albright's
diplomatic mission. A dangerous "limbo" could set in to the Middle
East peace process if "the enemies of peace" forced Albright to
postpone her trip, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Everything possible must be done to stop them (terrorist
bombings). The peace process can only move forward in a secure
environment," he said at a hastily arranged news conference. "This
is a message that Secretary Albright will emphasize when she
travels to the region next week."
</P>
<P>
Albright, who is in her Czech birthplace this week for her
vacation, issued a brief statement through the American embassy in
Prague shortly after the Jerusalem bombings, saying she would
"travel to the Middle East as scheduled."
</P>
<P>
"Fighting terror is a 24-hour-a-day job. Security cooperation
must be accompanied by unilateral Palestinian action to preempt
terror, destroy infrastructure as well as to create a political
climate where there is no tolerance for terror."
</P>
<P>
After the Jerusalem bombings this morning, Israel's Ambassador
Eliahu Ben-Elissar called on U.S. mediator Dennis Ross at the
State Department and conveyed a message from Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying that Israel's official
position was to welcome the secretary of state to travel to visit
the Jewish state "according to the original schedule."

WASHINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Officials are projecting a
voter turnout of 20 percent in the Miami referendum on whether to
abolish the city's government and turn it over to Dade County.
</P>
<P>
Officials say the turnout in Hispanic precincts could be as
high as 35 percent. Most of the city's Latins are expected to
oppose the measure, which reached the ballot as the result of last
fall's city hall scandals.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Joe Carollo predicted the voters would decide to keep
Miami's city government by a 70-30 margin, The United Press
International reported.
</P>
<P>
The measure was placed on the ballot by petition after federal
prosecutors indicted ranking city officials on various corruption
charges.
</P>
<P>
Also on the ballot today is a measure to create a strong mayor
and elect commissioners by district rather than at large. Both are
expected to pass.

bombings in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Seven people were reported to have been killed and 192 wounded

The Islamic militant group Hamas has claimed responsibility for

The group threatened to carry out more attacks unless Israel

In a statement, Chretien registered his concern about the
impact that the terrorist attack could have on the peace process
in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"This act of cowardice is aimed at destroying the hopes of all
people for peace in the region. We cannot allow terrorists to
succeed," he said.

of the victims and the people of Israel," he added.

<P>
BRUSSELS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)'s
finance ministers were today urged to kill talk of delaying the
euro by adopting a firm commitment to the single currency
timetable at their meeting in Mondorf, Luxembourg, next week.
</P>
<P>
The call came from the chairwoman of the European Parliament's
monetary subcommittee, Christa Randzio-Plath, after declarations
by Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer and Italian Foreign
Minister Lamberto Dini gave rise to speculation that governments
might be developing postponement as a fallback position.
</P>
<P>
"We need a really clear message from ministers that the
timetable for the euro will be fully respected," Ms. Randzio-Plath
said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Talk of delaying the euro is damaging Europe's best interests.
Ministers must put an end to it," she added.
</P>
<P>
Ms Randzio-Plath, whose committee later today met Henri
Emmanuelli, president of the French National Assembly's finance
committee, congratulated the French government on ensuring that
action on job creation would be linked to the introduction of the
euro.
</P>
<P>
She urged ministers to improve the prospects of effective EU
action to overcome the problem of 18 million unemployed people by
adopting a pact on economic coordination.

JOHANNESBURG, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government has appointed a team to investigate the presence of
generals of the former Zairean defense force in the country,
local radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
If the generals are found to be living in South Africa
illegally, they will be deported, the report said.
</P>
<P>
President Laurent Kabila of the Democratic Repbulic of Congo
(DRC), accused the generals of having fled the former Zaire with
millions of dollars.

Kabila, who visited Pretoria in late August, claimed that the
generals were using South Africa as a base to destablize the DRC.
</P>
<P>
kabila took power of DRC in May after his armed force,
Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire
overwhelmed the then government troops led by Mobutu Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela has said that South
Africa will set up a team under Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo to
look into the allegations, noting his government does not want
the country to be a base for destablizing any country.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Ninety-three drinking water
projects have been constructed in the eastern development region
of Nepal in the past four fiscal years, benefiting about 400,000
people, the official RSS news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) bore the lion's share of the
total cost of 287.44 million rupees (5.04 million U.S. dollars)
with loan assistance, while the rest were covered by the
government of Nepal and local people.
</P>
<P>
Another 26 drinking water projects which have been completed
under the third-phase program of the ADB have yet to be handed
over to the users, the RSS said.
</P>
<P>
And construction of 87 new drinking water projects in this
region under the ADB's fourth-phase drinking water program has
been proposed.
</P>
<P>
Once completed, these projects will bring pure drinking water
to an additional 105,000 people, the agency added.
</P>
<P>
Lack of clean drinking water is one of the biggest problems
facing the Nepalese.

Although there are only a few people in Japan who reject
history and undermine the normal development of bilateral ties,
Jiang went on, their misguided thinking has quite a strong
negative impact.
</P>
<P>
This must be nipped in the bud, Jiang warned, and illustrated
it by saying, "By using a brass mirror, one can see to adjust
one's cap, by using antiquity as a mirror, one can learn to
predict the rise and fall of empires."
</P>
<P>
Jiang emphasized the importance of Japan's adopting a correct
attitude toward historical issues, especially in providing the
younger generation with a correct historical viewpoint, because
this will be beneficial to long-term promotion of bilateral
relations and conducive to the development of Japan itself.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the two countries' leaders should
understand the bilateral relations from a long-term and strategic
perspective.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said he highly valued Jiang's view on history and
that the vast majority of the Japanese are in favor of peace and
against militarism and that this will in no way change.
</P>
<P>
He will continue to look at history in a proper way, he said,
because only by having a proper understanding of history can one
face the future.

<HEADLINE> Policy On Dalai Lama Remains Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- China's central government will
welcome the Dalai Lama back to Tibet if he completely renounces
the idea of "independence of Tibet", Gyam Co, vice chairman of the
Tibetan Autonomous Regional Government, told a group of
Beijing-based foreign journalists today
</P>
<P>
"The central government's attitude towards the Dalai Lama
remains unchanged," he said, and the Dalai's "a high degree of
autonomy for Tibet" and "one country, two systems" ideas are
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that "one country, two systems" is a concept put
forth by Deng Xiaoping, which was meant to solve the Hong Kong,
Macao and Taiwan questions. It is only suitable for these three
issues, he said, and the resumption of feudal serfdom in Tibet
would only be a disaster for the Tibetan people.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that religious activities are conducted in an orderly
fashion, the vice chairman noted, the regional government started
patriotic education among the monks and nuns in the region last
year, increasing their awareness of the motherland, the law, and
Tibet's history.
</P>
<P>
"The vast majority of the monks and nuns understand and uphold
government policies and laws," he said. There are more than 1,700
temples and monastries, and 46,000 monks and nuns in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of the Tibet Autonomous Region in 1965,
it has had great changes. Last year, its GDP was as six times that of
1965 and average life expectancy jumped from 36 in 1951 to 65.
</P>
<P>
The vice chairman welcomed the visits of foreign journalists to
Tibet. "Objective and truthful coverage of Tibet will benefit our
work," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese And Saint Lucia Foreign Ministers Confer in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen, in talks today with George Odlum, Minister
of Foreign Affairs and International Trade of Saint Lucia, said
that China is ready to develop its relations with the eastern
Carribean nations on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful
Co-existence.
</P>
<P>
Odlum, whose visit comes shortly after the establishment of
diplomatic relations between the two countries, said that this
shows the great importance attached by the government of Saint
Lucia to bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Qian said he believes that Odlum's visit will help lay a sound
foundation for overall development of friendly and co-operative
ties, and even though the two countries are far apart, the Chinese
people have always cherished friendly feelings for the people of
Saint Lucia.
</P>
<P>
When Saint Lucia declared independence, he said, China's
premier sent congratulations and the Chinese government sent
representatives to attend the celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Chinese government has been active in
developing friendly and co-operative relations with Saint Lucia,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that the two countries have their respective
characteristics and that they face the same task of vitalizing
their own economies and improving people's standard of living, but
that he believes there are bright prospects for relations.
</P>
<P>
Odlum said that he was pleased to visit China when the two
countries established diplomatic relations, which widened the area
of bilateral co-operation and created favorable conditions for
further development of relations between China and other eastern
Carribean nations.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that China attaches great importance to its economic
and trade co-operation with Saint Lucia and that close
co-operation between the governments of the two countries is very
important.
</P>
<P>
Odlum said that because China is the biggest developing country
in the world and a friend of developing nations, there is a solid
foundation for co-operation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that Saint Lucia agrees with China's proposal that the
two governments increase co-operation, and encourage entrepreneurs
to have more exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that China attaches great importance to relations
with Latin American and Carribean nations, and that China
officially joined the Carribean Development Bank not long ago and
established an official dialog with the South America Common
Market. China also filed applications for observers for the Latin
American Parliament and the Association of Carribean States, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Odlum said that Saint Lucia highly values its sovereignty and
sticks to internationally-recognized norms, and that his nation
will follow the "one China" policy and will never have official
ties with Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Praises Russian Position on Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus today welcomed a Russian
official spokesman's statements on Moscow's position on the Cyprus
issue and its commitment to a controversial missile deal with
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, Government Spokesman
Manolis Christofides was making comments on statements by Russian
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Guennadi Tarasov on Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Russia's position stated by Tarasov to recognize only the
Republic of Cyprus and its lawful government corresponds with
U.N. resolutions, said Christofides.
</P>
<P>
Tarasov was quoted as telling Turkish journalists in Moscow
recently that there is only one internationally-recognized state
in Cyprus, and that no other country except Turkey recognizes the
illegal entity set up in the northern island.
</P>
<P>
The eastern Mediterranean island has remained divided since
1974 when Turkish troops invaded and took the norther third of the
island after a short-lived coup by some Greek Cypriots seeking
union with Greece. A break-away republic was unilaterally
established by Turkish Cypriots in the north in 1985.
</P>
<P>
The Russian official also called on the Greek and Turkish
Cypriot sides to step up efforts for a Cyprus settlement.
</P>
<P>
Christofides said "we endorse the plea for the intensification
of efforts toward achieving a true and permanent solution of the
Cyprus problem through honorable and constructive dialog for the
future of Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
According to Cyprus News Agency today, the Russian Foreign
Ministry spokesman also slammed Turkey over the issue of ship
searching.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Turkey has recently searched ships
passing through the Bosporus Strait in the Black Sea, suspecting
they carry parts of Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missiles bound for
Cyprus under a deal reached early this year.
</P>
<P>
Tarasov said the search of commercial ships by Turkey runs
contrary to the provisions of the 1936 Montreux Convention for
free crossing.
</P>
<P>
The issue will be discussed by the Russian and Turkish foreign
ministries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Tarasov pledged the missiles would be delivered according to
the agreed contract and there are no reasons for their delay.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus' decision to purchase Russian missiles has
triggered warning from Turkey that it will launch pre-emptive
strike against Cyprus if the missiles are deployed.

<HEADLINE> Plavsic Against Advancing Presidential Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb President
Biljana Plavsic Thursday night voiced her objection to advancing
the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The presidential election should be held in September 1998 and
local elections on September 13-14 this year as scheduled, Plavsic
said in a statement issued by the television station of Banja Luka.
</P>
<P>
The president said she decided to dissolve the Serbian
parliament and hold parliamentary elections in advance because
only in this way could the government be reshuffled.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic called for "comprehensive
elections" in Bosnia to solve its current crisis when meeting
Wednesday with Carlos Westerndorp, the international high
representative in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"Comprehensive elections" mean the holding of presidential,
parliamentary and local elections simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
However, the government and parliament of the Bosnian Serb
republic, believed to be actually controlled by former president
Radovan Karadzic, have already decided to boycott Plavsic's
proposal for a new parliamentary election, and the local elections
scheduled for September 13-14 nationwide sponsored by the
international community.
</P>
<P>
The crisis within the Bosnian Serb leadership began in early
July.
</P>
<P>
Plavsic dissolved the parliament on July 3, but the decision
met strong opposition from the parliament and the Serb government.
</P>
<P>
The Constitutional Court in August ruled Plavsic's decision
unconstitutional and invalid. Plavsic rejected the verdict of the
court.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean Deputy Premier Calls for Corporate Self-Rescue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 5 (Xinhua) -- South Korean Deputy Prime
Minister Kang Kyung-shik today criticized the country's
economically troubled companies for depending on the government to
save them and urged them to rescue themselves.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Inha University in Inchon, Kang, the country's top
economic policymaker, blamed the country's trouble-stricken
economy on the mismanagement of banks and firms.
</P>
<P>
He criticized banks for indiscriminately extending loans to
large conglomerates on the brink of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
He said private companies should salvage themselves by
correcting their managerial mistakes rather than turning to the
government for help.
</P>
<P>
Kang rejected criticism that the government's latest aid
package, extended to some ailing local industrial and financial
firms, like the Kia Group and Korea First Bank, was not sufficient.
</P>
<P>
The government would no longer extend special aid or favors to
private enterprises mired in financial troubles, he said.
</P>
<P>
Excessive aid from the government would deteriorate economic
vitality, make corporate self-rescue efforts meaningless, and
increase the financial burden on ordinary citizens by driving up
the inflation rate, he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets Japanese Prime Minister-1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin, in a
meeting today with Ryutaro Hashimoto, who is making his first
official visit to China as prime minister, said that China and
Japan should advance their bilateral friendship for generations to
come.
</P>
<P>
The two countries should strictly observe the Sino-Japanese
Joint Statement and the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and
Friendship when promoting bilateral relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders had an important meeting in Manila last
November that played a significant and positive role in improving
and developing bilateral relations, Jiang noted, adding that he
hoped Hashimoto's visit, which comes on the 25th anniversary of
normalization of diplomatic relations between the two countries,
will help advance bilateral ties in a healthy and steady way.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said he was honored to meet with Jiang again, and
that maintaining constant contacts between leaders of the two
countries is important for bilateral relations and that he hopes
his visit will serve as a new starting point in Japan-China
relations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that China-Japan relations are entering a
significant period, inheriting the past and ushering in the
future, and that this relationship will have a heavy impact on
both countries, the region and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
When Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou Enlai were alive, they said
that the two peoples should be friendly to each other for
generations, and with the new century drawing near, this goal
remains, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"We hold that both sides should continue to strictly abide by
the principles set in the joint statement and the peace and
friendship treaty, and properly handle the existing problems
between the two countries in the spirit of seeking common grounds
while reserving differences, as this is the important guarantee to
realize the goal," Jiang stressed.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Jiang went on to say, leaders of both
countries should understand and handle, with a long-term and
strategic perspective, the bilateral relationship and usher in a
healthy and steady Sino-Japanese relationship into the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto stated that due to efforts of the older political
figures in the two countries, Japan and China normalized their
diplomatic ties in 1972 and that in the past 25 years, the
promotion of bilateral ties are based on the joint statement and
the peace and friendship treaty.
</P>
<P>
The principles set in these two political documents will remain
the guidelines for the relations between the two countries, the
prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
He stated that Japan is ready to advance a long-term friendly
relationship with China in accordance with the two documents.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed that in reviewing the contact history of the two
nations, friendship is the mainstream in the past 2,000 years or
more.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, in modern times, Japanese militarists waged
wars of aggression against China, causing great losses and
suffering to the Chinese, and the Japanese people were made to
suffer a lot themselves. Correctly understanding and viewing this
period of history is of great importance for the future of the two
nations.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Opposition Leader Proposes Delaying Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 5 (Xinhua) -- South Korean opposition leader
Kim Jong-pil today proposed delaying the presidential election,
due on December 18, to gain time to revise the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
"We still have time to amend the Constitution before President
Kim's term in office ends (in February next year) if he is
determined to do so," said Kim, leader and also presidential
candidate of the number two opposition party, United Liberal
Democrats (ULD).
</P>
<P>
Kim called for a national referendum on constitutional revision
aimed at building a parliamentary system of government.
</P>
<P>
The ULD leader said: "I have conveyed my intentions to
President Kim (Young-sam) several times. And I believe he has no
option other than accepting a parliamentary system if he wishes to
create a new political structure."
</P>
<P>
By law, Kim Jong-pil said, a presidential election can be held
up to 40 days before the presidential term of office expires, so
the coming presidential poll could be delayed until early January.
</P>
<P>
Kim Jong-pil's proposal came at a time when the ruling New
Korea Party (NKP) is in trouble over its presidential candidate
Lee Hoi-chang's fading popularity.
</P>
<P>
The ULD leader's proposal embarrassed the main opposition
National Congress for New Politics (NCNP), which is currently
negotiating with the ULD on putting forward a joint presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
The two parties have agreed to produce a compromise on the
joint candidacy by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
The NCNP withheld any immediate response to Kim's suggestions,
but some party officials expressed negative reactions.
</P>
<P>
"We need time before we react to his proposal," said Han
Kwang-ok, a NCNP vice president and top negotiator on the single
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
The splinter opposition Democratic Party (DP) immediately
brushed Kim's idea aside.
</P>
<P>
"Talking about a change of government system and election
delays when the country is experiencing a difficult period will
not help overcome the crisis," DP leader Cho Soon said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President May Opt to Run for Re-election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos said here today that he may opt to run for re-election
should the country's Constitution be amended to lift term limits.
</P>
<P>
"I must keep options open because it is not only my personal
future that is at stake here. It is the national interest and the
people's well-being", he said in his dialogue with businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said he was not worried about being criticized for his
new position, which is a departure from his repeated answer that
he will step down on June 30 next year as provided by the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
"If I must remain that way and get all kinds of flak, I'm
willing to go through that flak. I'm used to it. It is the bread
and butter of this office and during my entire 45 years in the
bureaucracy before becoming President. I'm used to this kind of
crisis situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Some representatives of the business community wrote to Ramos
on Monday, recommending the Ramos administration to focus on the
economic growth instead of the Charter change to lift term limits.
</P>
<P>
The country's economic growth rate slowed down to 5.9 percent
in the first half of the year compared with the 7.5 percent in the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The business group partially attributed the economic slowdown
and recent sharp plunge of the peso to the political uncertainty
arising from the Charter change move in the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former President Corazon Aquino and Cardinal Jaime
Sin called for a rally on September 21 to protest against the
Charter change move that may bring in another dictator like
Ferdinand Marcos.
</P>
<P>
Ramos lashed back at the business group and the Catholic
Church, saying that they are instigating a "hate campaign" against
the government.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine monetary authorities
is requiring all banks, including their subsidiaries and
affiliates, to report their daily foreign exchange positions
starting from September 10.
</P>
<P>
In a circular issued today, Central Bank Governor Gabriel
Singson ordered the banks to follow foreign exchange rules and
regulations, requiring bank officials to issue a monthly
certification to confirm that the reporting of the positions is
accurate.
</P>
<P>
Singson said what the banks are required to report includes
foreign currency positions against the peso at any branches and
offices, subsidiaries and affiliates both here and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The circular also applies to other entities engaged in foreign
exchange trading or foreign exchange corporations that are
affiliated with the banks either by ownership, management control
or influence, he said.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Central Bank found out that some banks fueled the
peso's depreciation by buying more dollars at higher foreign
exchange rate than what was allowed by the Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts considered the Central Bank's action a new move
to arrest the further decline of the peso, of which the value has
fallen by 23 percent since it was floated in a wider band on July
11.

MANILA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Industrial sales in the
Philippines reached 204.6 billion pesos (around 6.8 billion U.S.
dollars) in the first half of the year, an increase of 11 percent
over the same period last year, the Philippine News Agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted by the Department of Trade and Industry
shows that 12 of the country's 21 sectors posted positive growth
during the period.
</P>
<P>
The garments sector is the highest earner, rebounding from last
year's lackluster performance to a revenue of 36.6 billion pesos
(1.2 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The survey attributes the growth to the greater demand for
Philippine apparel products from the United States, Japan and
European countries.
</P>
<P>
Electronics, the second biggest earner, shows the highest
growth rate of 33 percent. It is followed by the food processing
industry.
</P>
<P>
The biggest loser is still the sugar sector, of which the sales
plummeted further by 58 percent due to the stiff competition with
the cheaper imported sugar in the domestic market.

<HEADLINE> German Opposition Blocks Tax Reforms Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Germany's main opposition party,
the Social Democrats (SPD), today used its majority in the upper
house of parliament to veto again a tax reform package proposed by
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's centre-right government.
</P>
<P>
The bill before the Bundesrat was to introduce a tax reduction
of about 30 billion marks (16.6 billion U.S. dollars) from
1999. The SPD opposes the size of the tax cuts, saying they would
pose financial ruin for the public sector.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Theo Waigel had urged the Bundesrat to approve
the tax reform. He said it was urgently needed to help revive the
country's depressed economy and create more jobs.
</P>
<P>
Even international organizations were pressing Bonn to carry
out the reform, he added.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which had been adjusted after it was first blocked by
the SPD, will go back to mediation between the Bundesrat and the
Bundestag, the lower house, where the ruling coalition holds the
majority.

MOGADISHU, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Faction leader, Mr Ali
Mahdi Mohamed, has today arrived in Mogadishu after a month long
absence in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
Mr Ali Mahdi who was welcomed by cheering crowds was escorted
by dozens of technical vehicles belonging to his faction from the
dusty airstrip of Issaley, 15 km north of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Speaking with his supporters and reporters at his residence in

than anything else which is the formation of a representative
government before the end of this year.
</P>

Mr Ali Mahdi said the Somali factions who formed the National
Salvation Council (NSC) in Ethiopia are determined to form a
broad-based and strong government as he put it. Speaking about
the reconciliation process, Mr Ali Mahdi has called the Somali
people to reconcile within themselves and show a feeling of
forgiveness to each other.

Mr Ali Mahdi was leading a seven member delegation from the
National Salvation Council formed in Ethiopia by 26 factions
earlier this year. Mr Ali Mahdi has also been welcomed by his
factional police band who sang the national anthem of the country
and gave him a warm salutation at the airstrip.
</P>
<P>
Despite the hope for a government by the NSC factions soon,
the northeastern town of Bossaso where Ali Mahdi's dream
government would be established, has been having political
difficulties and tragedy ahead of its anticipated national
reconciliation conference due to be held in early November this
year.
</P>
<P>
A fire had devastated 250 huts and houses in the eastern
quarter of the town of Bossaso mainly inhabited by refugees six
days ago and displaced more than 700 people who lived in the
area. So it will be difficult for Bossaso to host more than 600
delegates from the multitude clans around the country for the
anticipated national reconciliation conference.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, there is a power struggle among the three separate
authorities in the northeastern region, the traditional elders,
the legislative council and the politicians of the Somali
Salvation Democratic Front (SSDF).

<HEADLINE> France Calls on Palestinians to Stop ``Gears of Terror'' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 5 (Xinhuua) -- France today called on
Palestinians to ``do all they can to stop the gears of terror.''
</P>
<P>
The call issued after a triple suicide bombing by suspected
Palestinian terrorists killed seven people and wounded 170 in
Jerusalem on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
``The peace process is threatened even in its foundation. All
should be done by the Palestinian side to put an end to the gears of
terror, all should be done by the Palestinian side to save the
achievements of the concluded accords,'' said French Foreign
Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that France is deeply worried by the latest
attack in Jerusalam and calls on Israel and Palestinians to ``revive
the logic of peace.''
</P>
<P>
``Only a negotiated, just and lasting peace could procure to all
the peoples of the region the security to which they aspire,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac today made telephone calls to
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri, urging them to
``give back a little hope to the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
Chirac expressed his hope that the peace process could be
relaunched with the forthcoming visit by the United States Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright to the Middle East, said French
presidential office.
</P>
<P>
``The president of the republic is following very closely the
dramatic evolution of the situation in the Middle East,'' said
French officials.

<HEADLINE> France Concerned over Israeli Raid in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 5 (Xinhua) -- France says it is "extremely
worried" by Israel's pre-dawn commando raid today in southern
Lebanon, in which at least 11 Israeli soldiers were killed.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said the clash
between Israeli troops and the Lebanese army and Shiite militiamen
was a "very grave incident".
</P>
<P>
Calling on all parties involved to exercise great restraint, he
said: "All should be done to ward off the risk of escalation in
order not to imperil the reconstruction of Lebanon and its unity,
and moreover, the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri told French President
Jacques Chirac earlier today by telephone that an airborne Israeli
commando group landed in a residential and tourist area at least
30 kilometers north of the habitual combat zone.
</P>
<P>
Hariri said Lebanon considered this raid a violation of the
Israeli-Lebanese truce agreement signed in April 1996 under the
mediation of the United States and France. It required both sides
of the conflict to spare civilians.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli soldiers immediately came under heavy fire from
Lebanese troops, Amal militiamen and Hezbollah, according to the
Israeli army.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today described the
failed commando raid as "one of the worst tragedies" of the
Israeli army.
</P>
<P>
The raid came just one day after a triple suicide bombing by
suspected Palestinian militants killed seven and injured 170
others in a popular mall in the Jewish part of Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> HK to Host Etchells World Yachting Championship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Preparations for the OOCL
Etchells World Yachting Championship are well underway, organizers
said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The championship, slated for November 5 to 17 here, is the
fourth and last regatta of the OOCL World Series. Before the
world championship there will be the OOCL Hong Kong China
Championship for November 1-5, this year, which is the third leg
in the series.
</P>
<P>
The two regattas are to be held in the waters south of Lamma
Channel of Hong Kong Island.
</P>
<P>
Skippers who collect the highest accumulated points over the
three-year, four-regatta series, will win the OOCL World Series
Trophy.
</P>
<P>
This year's races are expected to attract the largest number of
and most competitive sailors. Among them are John Bertrand of
America's Cup fame and past Asia Pacific Champions and world
number two Jud Smith, and Poul Ricard Hoj-Jensen, a former Olympic
champion, according to the organizers.
</P>
<P>
Now leading the points standings are Warwick Downes and Mark
Thornburrow from Hong Kong, China, largely due to their consistent
top finishes in the first two regattas -- the OOCL fourth and OOCL
fifth championships in November, 1995 and 1996 respectively.
</P>
<P>
This year's championships will draw sailors from different
countries and regions including Australia, New Zealand, the United
States, Britain, Italy, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) and, for the first time, China.
</P>
<P>
It is also the first time that an international sailing event
will take place in the Hong Kong SAR, which was established on
July 1 this year, after Hong Kong's handover.

<HEADLINE> Tung Says First Overseas Trip "Very Useful" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, Chief
Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)
described his first overseas trip as "very useful, constructive
and successful," a Hong Kong SAR Government spokesman told
reporters here today.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive believed that leaders in Singapore and
Malaysia could see that Hong Kong was running smoothly and that
Hong Kong's lifestyle remained unchanged, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Tung was quoted as saying that they were all very happy about
the return of Hong Kong to China, the smoothly functioning of the
SAR Government for the last two months and the implementation of
the concept of the "One Country, Two Systems".
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Tung held a private meeting late this
afternoon with Singapore's Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew, of whom,
the chief executive said "he is a great statesman whom I respect a
great deal."
</P>
<P>
"We had some very useful discussion. He's obviously happy to
see the transition has been smooth and things going on well in
Hong Kong," Tung was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We also talked about the currency turmoil recently and about
the stock market turmoil. It was a very useful and very helpful
discussion," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this afternoon, the chief executive met with
Singaporean Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defense Dr.
Tony Tan and discussed with him the expanding application of
information technology in schools and communities.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that housing supply and renovation, the
qualities of housing, tenant facilities and housing design were
among the topics discussed during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Tung will return to Hong Kong on Saturday morning and leave
for a five-day visit to the United States on Monday morning, the
spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> South Korea, Japan to Hold Fishery Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 5 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and Japan will hold
the fifth round of fishery talks here Wednesday to discuss
revision to the bilateral fishery agreement, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Lee Kyu-hyung said today.
</P>
<P>
The talks will be preceded by a one-day meeting Tuesday to look
into the alleged beating of a South Korean fisherman by Japanese
maritime security officers, he said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides started negotiations in May, 1996, on revising
the bilateral fishery accord, reached in 1965. But overlapping
claims to rocky islets in the waters between them have prevented
notable progress so far.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations stalled following Japan's seizure of South
Korean fishing boats in June and July in its newly expanded
territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
The talks were only resumed in Tokyo in August after the
foreign ministers of the two countries agreed on a set of meetings
to ease the dispute over the captures.
</P>
<P>
During the August talks, South Korean delegates agreed to
consider a provisional fishery agreement with Japan.
</P>
<P>
But they said consideration of this would be made on condition
South Korea's claim to the Tokto islets (Takeshima islets in
Japanese) were not affected and existing rights for South Korean
fishermen were fully guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
Japan has demanded an early solution to the fishing disputes by
means of a provisional agreement.

CAIRO, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat will visit Egypt Saturday for talks with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak on the situation following the fatal bomb explosions
in Jerusalem Thursday, Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA)
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The MENA report quoted Palestinian official source as saying
the two leaders will probe the ways of salvaging the peace process
and the preparations for the upcoming visit to the region by
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
The triple suicide bombing in Ben Yahuda Street downtown west
Jerusalem killed seven people and wounded more than 190. Islamic
militant group Hamas has claimed responsibility to the bombing.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak condemned the explosions that targeted innocent
civilians, saying such acts would only further complicate the
already-tense situation and block the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He urged all parties concerned to observe self-restraint in
such hard circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israeli government imposed closure on the
Palestinian self-ruled areas after the bombing attacks and barred
Arafat's aircraft from leaving Gaza Strip.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Equal pay for equal work is the top concern of working
women, according to a survey released by the American Federation
of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations. Of the sample of
women polled nationwide, 94 percent said equal pay was very
important to them -- and more than one-third of them did not get it
at their current job.
</P>
<P>
-- Biologists have redesigned a cattle virus to make it attack
H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, at a vulnerable moment in its
life cycle. In laboratory experiments with cultures of infected
human cells, the engineered virus reduced the H.I.V. to
undetectable levels, raising the possibility of an entirely new
kind of therapy for treating AIDS and perhaps other viral diseases
as well.
</P>
<P>
-- Despite tougher Federal laws to make education available to
homeless young children, more than 180,000 of them around
the country have been unable to enroll in public pre-school
programs, according to a report.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Supreme Court yesterday refused to block a California
law that prohibits racial preferences in government hiring and
school admissions, rejecting arguments that the law be suspended
immediately because it will cause upheaval in the state.
</P>
<P>
-- A binational study sponsored by the U.S. and Mexican
governments has concluded that illegal immigration from Mexico has
taken on a life of its own here, sustained by expanding networks
to U.S. employers, with detrimental results for both countries.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. troops in Bosnia pulled out of a checkpoint they had
established at a bridge in Brcko. A spokesman said the move was
unrelated to attacks on the troops after they moved into the
strategic town last week. The U.S. is sending more warplanes to
the region ahead of Bosnia Serb elections September 13-14.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Meets With Japanese PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- In a meeting with Japanese
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto today in Beijing's Great Hall of
the People, Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji said he hopes China and Japan
will maintain peace and friendship and work together to greet the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister's China trip is significant in this 25th
anniversary year of normalization of bilateral relations, Zhu
said, wishing the visit a complete success.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said that China has scored admirable achievements in
economic construction, reforms and opening up, and that its
economic development is important for maintaining regional and
global peace and stability, and means bright prospects for
Sino-foreign economic ties and trade. Japan wants to expand its
economic cooperation and trade with China and to help China in the
modernization drive, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu pointed out that great progress has been made in bilateral
relations since the normalization of bilateral relations 25 years
ago, but that there are still issues that can not be neglected. Of
these, the issue of history and the issue of Taiwan are the
most sensitive, and should be handled cautiously since they are
directly related to the political principles of Sino-Japanese
relations.
</P>
<P>
In the future, Zhu said, the two sides should continue to
strictly observe various principles of the Sino-Japanese Joint
Statement and the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and
Friendship. The two countries have become each other's important
economic and trade partner, he noted, thanks to long-standing
efforts.
</P>
<P>
That good economic co-operation and trade have become an
important symbol for the sound development of bilateral relations,
he added. Last year two-way trade exceeded 60 billion U.S. dollars
and Japan has been China's biggest trade partner for 4 years in a
row, and that trade has maintained its momentum.
</P>
<P>
China's and Japan's economies have their strong and weak point,
but as long as the governments of the two countries actively
support and guide their economic ties in terms of policy, there is
great potential for co-operation, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the meeting were Minister of Finance Liu
Zhongli, the chairman of the Chinese government reception
committee, and Vice-foreign minister Tang Jiaxuan.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Condemns Bombing in Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today condemned the suicide bombing in downtown West Jerusalem
Thursday, and called for a "resolute and uncompromising fight"
against such terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process would not be hampered by
terrorists and extremist force and it would withstand any attack
from the anti-peace camp, Yeltsin was quoted by his press
secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky as saying.
</P>
<P>
Three suicide bombers and four other people were killed in the
attack in a pedestrian mall packed with people. At least 165
others were injured in the bombing, which came just five weeks
after another suicide attack killed 17 in the same neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
Russia's Foreign Ministry also joined in criticism today
against the terrorists and urged Israelis and Palestinians to
return to the negotiation table.
</P>
<P>
It said in a statement that by the bombing, the extremists were
trying to provoke the Israelis and to block a healthy development
of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the best response to such act would be
Palestinians and Israelis resuming peace talks, which have been
stalled since March when Israel broke ground to build a
controversial Jewish settlement in Arab east Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> SADC Calls Upon International Community to Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) has called upon the international
community to help eradicate a contagious cattle disease which
threats the region, according to Zambia News Agency (ZANA) report
today.
</P>
<P>
Kaire Mbuende, executive secretary of the SADC Council of
Ministers, told a news briefing last evening in Malawi's southern
city Blantyre that the SADC council has decided to launch an
international appeal to help the region eradicate the disease.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that a contagious cattle lung disease
called Bovine Pleuropneaumonia (CBP) has spread in Botswana,
Angola, Zambia, Tanzania and Namibia.
</P>
<P>
The disease was first reported in Botswana where it has
claimed hundreds of thousands of cattle.
</P>
<P>
Mbuende added that the SADC Council of Ministers, which is
having a meeting in Blantyre in preparations for the upcoming
SADC summit schedualed for Monday, has urged the animal disease
control sector and the SADC Secretariate to liaise closely in
dealing with the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
At its opening meeting Thursday, the SADC council expressed
its deep concern over the continued epidemic outbreak of the
cattle disease, saying that it has reached "crisis proportions"
and is a serious economic threat to the region which relies
heavily on livestock farming.
</P>
<P>
The council also commended the Botswana government for its
efforts to eradicate the disease and noted that restocking was
under way in a district where over 300,000 cattle were destroyed
in the process of eradicating CBP.

<HEADLINE> Dialogue Enhances Sino-Japanese Trust: Hashimoto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto said here today Japan should correctly view its
history, face the future and forge a long-term good neighbor,
friendly and cooperative relationship with China.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered at the State Institute of Administration,
Hashimoto noted that the two countries previously passed through a
period of misery and that this is a fact.
</P>
<P>
He said that in a prime minister talk released in 1995, the
Japanese government made clear its understanding of the past
history.
</P>
<P>
He said that Japan will continue to proceed on the basis of the
talk to correctly view the past, increase its understanding of
history and carry out with China dialogue and cooperation that
will help create the future.
</P>
<P>
He said that he plans to visit the "September 18 Incident"
memorial in Shenyang in northeast China. The "September 18
Incident" marks the beginning of Japan's full-scale aggression
against China in 1931.
</P>
<P>
He said that the visit to the memorial is aimed to express his
personal feeling on viewing the past correctly.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto pointed out that Japan has been one of the major
beneficiaries of peace and development in the Asia-Pacific Region
and the world over the past decades.
</P>
<P>
He said that Japan has made a profound self-examination since
the end of World War II, and totally negated the path of becoming
a military power. Japan has instead set an objective of turning
itself into a peaceful country and achieved the monumental growth
it enjoys today.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Sino-Japanese relationship is of paramount
importance to Japan, and expressed the hope that his visit will
become a milestone in the development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto addressed the Taiwan issue by noting that the
Japanese government will adhere to the principles defined in the
Sino-Japanese Joint Statement and Sino-Japanese Treaty of
Friendship. He said Japan will never support "two Chinas" or
"Taiwan Independence".

<HEADLINE> Chirac to Visit Mauritania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 5 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
left here today for a two-day state visit to Mauritania to ``mark
his attachment and that of France to the African continent,'' said
the Elysee presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
This visit is apparently aimed at boosting French-African
relations following a series of crisis taking place this year in
French-speaking African countries including former Zaire, the
Central African Republic and the Congo Republic.
</P>
<P>
Chirac will hold talks with Mauritanian President Maaouya Ould
Sidi Ahmed Taya in Nouakchott today on cooperation in water
resource development and agriculture, and is expected to announce a
number of aid projects by France in Mauritania, according to
presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna.
</P>
<P>
This is the fifth visit by Chirac to the African continent since
he became president in May 1995. He is also the third French
president to visit Mauritania, after President Georges Pompidou in
1978 and President Francois Mitterrand in 1982.
</P>
<P>
Chirac is accompanied by Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine, and
former Prime Minister Pierre Messmer, who was governor of Atar
during the French colonial rule.

<HEADLINE> NPC Chairman Meets Japanese Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, met with
visiting Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto in the Great
Hall of the People this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said that bilateral relationship has undergone extensive
development and expanded in depth under the new historical
conditions since the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations 25
years ago. He also noted that cooperation between China's National
People's Congress and the Japanese Diet has expanded greatly.
</P>
<P>
China and Japan are both influential countries in the region
and throughout the world. The development of good neighborly
relations and the advancement of mutually beneficial
cooperation conform to the fundamental interests of both
countries and to the peace, development and stability of the
region and the world as a whole, said Qiao.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that both sides should summarize the experience and
lessons in the development of bilateral relations over the past 25
years. Both sides should uphold the principles and spirit of the
Sino-Japanese Joint Statement and Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace
and Friendship, and should use said documents as the political
basis for jointly advancing the steady and health development of
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Qiao also pointed out the existence of two major issues in
the bilateral relations following the normalization of their
relations -- the issue of history and the issue of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the Japanese government should adopt a
responsible attitude towards history, treat relevant issues in a
conscientious manner, and continue to follow the road of peace and
development.
</P>
<P>
Qiao addressed the Taiwan issue by noting that Japan should
earnestly value and respect China's stand and adhere to the
principles defined in the Sino-Japanese Joint Statement and the
Sino-Japanese Treaty of Pace and Friendship.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said that Japan and China have increased exchanges
and cooperation on international issues since the the
normalization of bilateral relations, in addition to frequently
arranging exchanges between the NPC and the Diet.
</P>
<P>
He promised that Japan would continue to abide by the
principles of the Joint Statement and the Treaty of Peace and
Friendship, follow the road of peace and development, maintain
friendly ties with China and refrain from interfering in China's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Liu Zhongli, who also serves as chairman of
the Chinese government reception committee, and Vice-Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan also attended the meeting.

<HEADLINE> China Expands Construction of State Information Projects (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has
initiated a series of national information projects in recent
years in an effort to keep abreast of stunning developments in
the world information industry, according to a high-ranking
official with the Ministry of Electronics Industry (MEI).
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with Xinhua, MEI Minister Hu Qili said
that related projects, dubbed "golden projects", cover almost all
major fields in the Chinese economy.
</P>
<P>
According to Hu, the "Golden Bridge" project has led to the
establishment of a nationwide public economic information network
linking 24 major Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
Trial operations of the "Golden Card" project, an electronic
currency system, are under way in 12 provinces, with six provinces
currently handling partial interbank financial transactions.
</P>
<P>
Tax departments in 350 cities have introduced the "Golden Tax"
project this year.
</P>
<P>
China has used its information infrastructure to launch a
number of large-scale application systems related to
macro-economic control, electronic data intercharge (EDI), airline
bookings, railway and electricity dispatching, public security and
office automation.
</P>
<P>
Hu said the development of information technology (IT) will be
a vital index for measuring a country's comprehensive strength in the
coming century. "China has a large developing economy which offers
a vast market for the IT industry," said Hu.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that the market scale of China's electronics
and information industry will top one trillion yuan by the year
2000. They also note that the figure will quite likely hit six
trillion yuan in 2010 and in so doing will transform China -- the
world's largest IT market which will offer "a large pie for all
capable participants in the field", according to the minister

<P>
Hu said China has closely followed trends in worldwide
networking in pursuit of opportunities to promote the nation's
development. MEI has proceeded under the leadership of the State
Council, China's highest administrative body, and has tried hard
to organize and coordinate the undertaking of key IT
projects. "MEI's efforts to promoted the development and
applications of computers have paid off," said Hu.
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative for local companies to develop and file
information that will crystalize the Chinese culture and
achievements in the moderization drive," according to Hu.
</P>
<P>
He urged local enterprises to further expand their
understanding of the role networking will play in future market
competition. "They should introduce their own home pages on the
Internet in order to protect their invisible property and polish
their market image," said Hu.
</P>
<P>
MEI statistics show that China's electronics and information
industry has registered sustained, rapid and healthy growth since
1992, with total output hitting 300 billion yuan in 1996,
quadruple the 1992 figure.
</P>
<P>
China's electronics and information industry maintained 25
percent annual growth in terms of industrial output, sales and
profits and taxes between 1992-1996. "The industry has been
transformed from a predominantly manufacturing sector into an
industry which combines hardware production with software
development and application services," said Hu.

<HEADLINE> SADC Brings More Private Involvement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BLANTYRE, MALAWI, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) has been bringing more private
involvement in the economic development, a SADC principal
economist said here today.
</P>
<P>
Chungu Mwila told a news briefing that the private sector has
been involved in 384 projects with an estimated C\tx9R]pDZe5$[aIVYsQ\oIWZo9R
e followed by energy and mining
sectors,sid.
</P>
<P>
When the Southern African Development Coordination Conference
(SADCC) was established in early 1980s, it was largely an
inter-governmental political organization, but since it was
turned into the SADC in 1992 it has gradually shifted its focus
on economic development and has made attempts to bring private
sectors together.
</P>
<P>
Private sectors are represented in the delegations to attend
the summit meeting, he said.
</P>
<P>
SADC set up a business council in 1991 and the council has
achieved a lot in bringing more private involvment in economic
activities in the past few years, he said.
</P>
<P>
To encourage private involvment is also to make the economies
self-sufficient by mobilizing their own resources.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, SADC set up power pool to bring their own resources
of the member countries togather and utilize them, he said.
</P>
<P>
The power pool also cooperates with non-members like Zaire
(now the Democratic Republic of Congo), the economist said.
</P>
<P>
A report on the private involvement will be presented to the
SADC summit to be held here next Monday, Mwila said.

<HEADLINE> LDP Regains Majority in Japan's Lower House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Japan's ruling Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP) regained sole control of the House of
Representatives (Lower House) today for the first time in four
years after it accepted a former member back into its fold.
</P>
<P>
Naoto Kitamura, a Lower House member who left the opposition
New Frontier Party (NFP) in May, applied to rejoin the LDP today
and was immediately approved by the LDP's Party Ethics Committee.
</P>
<P>
The LDP now holds 250 seats in the 500-seat Lower House,
regaining the majority it lost in the 1993 general elections.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, LDP lost its majority for the first time since its
1955 formation when a group of LDP members, including Kitamura,
broke away from the party. The LDP was an opposition party at
that time when a coalition government led by then Japan New Party
chief Morihiro Hosokawa was formed.
</P>
<P>
The LDP, the leading party in a coalition with two noncabinet
allies, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and New Party Sakigake,
eventually regained the premiership in January 1996 with LDP
president Ryutaro Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku
Kajiyama said that the LDP and its two parliamentary partners will
remain despite the LDP's recovery of a simple majority in the
Lower House.
</P>
<P>
The top government spokesman said the government will continue
to seek policy-by-policy coopration with opposition parties.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Banks Contribute More to GDP in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The foreign banks in Bangladesh,
with only about 7 percent share of the local market, have put in a
stunning 70 percent of the banking sector's total contribution to
the country's gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
During the last fiscal year (July 1, 1995 - June 30, 1996) the
contribution of the banking sector to the GDP of 33 billion U.S.
dollars was estimated at 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Operational efficiency, cautious lending approach and prudent
management of funds were attributed to the higher contribution by
the 14 foreign banks which also managed to maintain a steady rise
in their market share although they are small in size, the
Financial Express reported today.
</P>
<P>
The share of foreign banks in the banking sector's total
deposits rose to 7.25 percent in 1997 from 4.65 percent in 1994
while the share of lending jumped to 6.5 percent from 4.35 percent
during the period, the paper quoted bank sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Other profitability ratios, such as return on assets, return on
equity and the net interest margin of the foreign banks reached
4.75 and 6 percent respectively, which the sources said were quite
impressive.
</P>
<P>
Of the total lending by the foreign banks, 36 percent has been
to the trade sector, 28 percent to the manufacturing sector as
long-term loans, 19 percent to industries as working capital and
the remaining 17 percent to small borrowers under different
consumer credit schemes.

<HEADLINE> One Suspect Arrested in Stockhoom anti-Olympics bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, September 5 (Xinhua) -- A suspect in two powerful
bombings in Sweden was arrested late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Last month, bombs destroyed huge parts of the Olympic stadium
in Stockholm and the Ullevi stadium in Goeteborg.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old men was caught when he tried to blow up the
statue used as the symbol for the Stockholm's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
Chief of Stockholm's bid for the site of the 2004 Summer
Olympics said that the action showed Sweden would not let "the
voice of violence silence the voice of the sport."
</P>
<P>
The suspect's name was not immediately released, according to
judicial custom.
</P>
<P>
The bombings had casted a shadow over Stockholm's chances for
staging the Olympics, though no one was injured in the powerful
blasts.
</P>
<P>
The arrest came hours before the International Olympic
Committee was to choose among Stockholm and four other candidates
for the 2004 Games, during a meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland.

Region (HKSAR), today outlined the priorities for the HKSAR
judiciary, expressing determination to make the concept of "one
country, two systems" a success.
</P>
<P>
Speaking this afternoon at his first news conference since the
July 1 handover, Li said that as an institution of
the HKSAR government exercising judicial power, the judiciary is
an institution that belongs to the community and serves the
community.
</P>
<P>
"As chief justice, my mission is to lead the judiciary into the
21st century to maintain the rule of law so as to make the concept
of 'one country, two systems' a success," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li, who took office as chief justice of the Court of Final
Appeal on July 1, stressed that for the first time in its history
Hong Kong has its own final appellate court.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that his priorities in the next few years
include the following:
</P>
<P>
-- to work hard to ensure that the final court ranks among the
best of final courts in other common law jurisdictions;
</P>
<P>
-- to continue to make progress with the use of the Chinese
language in the courts and to ensure that the common law is
maintained and developed;
</P>
<P>
-- to strengthen judicial education and training for the
judges;
</P>
<P>
-- to ensure that the infrastructure (particularly staff)
support for the courts' functioning is efficient; and
</P>
<P>
-- to develop mutual understanding with the judicial colleagues
in the motherland and links with other common law jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
According to the Basic Law, the judicial system previously
practiced in Hong Kong shall be maintained except for those
changes consequent upon the establishment of the Court of Final
Appeal.
</P>
<P>
The power of final adjudication of the HKSAR shall be vested in
the Court of Final Appeal of the HKSAR, which may as required
invite judges from other common law jurisdictions to sit on the
Court of Final Appeal, the law stipulates.

<HEADLINE> SADC Seeks Declaration to Ban Land-Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BLANTYRE, MALAWI, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) is seeking to come up with a
declaration to ban land-mines in the region.
</P>
<P>
SADC executive secretary Kaire Mbuende said here on Thursday
that areas bordering Malawi and Mozambique are infested with
anti-personnel land-mines.
</P>
<P>
He said that SADC is one of the worst hit regions in the world
by land-mines, adding that there are more land-mines than people
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The SADC ministers' conference, which started on Thursday to
make preparations for the SADC summit to be held here next
Monday, also resolved that member states start preparations to
minimize the impact of the anticipated drought in the region to
be caused by El Nino climatic phenomenon from south east Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
"The region had been critically hit by drought due to lack of
preparedness," Mbuende said.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting the minister also highlighted the SADC trade
protocol, an agreement to reduce and then remove trade tariffs
and create a free trade zone in the region as being the launching
pad for successful regional integration in southern Africa,
according to Mbuende.
</P>
<P>
But so far only four countries -- Mauritius, Malawi, Tanzania
and Zimbabwe -- have ratified the protocol.
</P>
<P>
The council meeting also adopted two protocols on mining and
education and training.

<HEADLINE> 12 Israeli Soldiers Killed in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 5 (Xinhua) -- At least 12 Israeli soldiers
were killed this morning in fighting with Lebanese troops and
guerrillas in south Lebanon, security sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
This has partly been confirmed by news from Israel, which in an
army statement said 11 soldiers died and one was missing in the
battle, now presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued by the Lebanese army said that an Israeli
airborne commando launched a pre-dawn raid on the village of
Insariyeh, about 45 kilometers north of the Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli forces were immediately spotted by the Lebanese
troops and guerrillas of the Shiite Muslim militant Amal movement
and Hezbullah stationed in the area, who promptly opened fire, the
communique said.
</P>
<P>
The fighting lasted more than two hours and the Israelis
suffered some 20 casualties. Four of the wounded were rescued by
Israeli gunships.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that during the battle, a Lebanese army
position was hit, leaving a woman and a baby girl dead, a Lebanese
soldier and six civilians wounded.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese security sources said four Amal guerrillas and two
Hezbullah fighters were also injured in the clashes.
</P>
<P>
The pre-dawn raid, hours after a triple suicide bombing tore
through the heart of Jerusalem's western sector, was meant to
retaliate an Amal attack last week in which five Israeli soldiers
were killed.
</P>
<P>
But local reports said today's fighting dealt the worst
casualties for Israeli forces in a single battle in the area in
more than 12 years.

<HEADLINE> Safety Rules for HK's Overseas Tour Operators Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Some 3,000 Hong Kong guides
who conduct overseas tours will have to obtain professional
certificates under a proposal to improve safety, obviously in wake
of series of accidents involving Hong Kong residents.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's Travel Industry Council is expected to issue to its
1,200 member agents with rules on the safety of overseas tours and
the appointment of overseas partners, who must have adequate
insurance coverage, before next year.
</P>
<P>
Agents who fail to comply could have their licenses suspended,
local English-language newspaper South China Morning Post reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The proposals were among six recommendations endorsed Thursday
by the Travel Agents Advisory Committee.
</P>
<P>
A regular meeting was held after the Manila Bay accident last
month in which a boat capsized, drowning seven Hong Kong tourists.
</P>
<P>
The committee, comprising travel industry members and
government officials, agreed on the need to boost professionalism
among the 3,000 full and part-time guides, including those
conducting overseas tours.
</P>
<P>
It suggested training for outbound tour guides, including how
to handle emergencies, should be improved.
</P>
<P>
A certificate system should also be introduced, it said.
</P>
<P>
Committee member and provisional legislator Howard Young said:
"The idea of the certificate system is to assure the tour guides
possess all-round qualifications in the profession."
</P>
<P>
Their training could include safety knowledge, courtesy, and
how to protect tourists' interests, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The upward trend in trading
on the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) continued this week despite a
slight drop in the trading volume
</P>
<P>
The SSE Comprehensive Index closed the week at 1,251.55 points,
up 2.5 percent over last week, with the SSE 30 Index rising by
1.32 percent to end at 3,809.7 points.
</P>
<P>
The week's trading volume totaled 26.21 billion yuan, down 1.94
percent from last week.
</P>
<P>
Blue chip stocks such as Yizheng Chemical Fiber, Shanghai
Petrochemical and Ma'anshan Iron and Steel remained as the market
leaders this week, while investors gradually turned from lower
priceed shares to medium- and high-priced issues.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts attribute the continued upward momentum on the
bourse to the public's growing confidence in the state-owned
enterprises, which are expected to enter a new phase of reform
following the 15th Congress of the Communist Party of China due to
open September 12.
</P>
<P>
The latest issue of state bonds valued at 13 billion yuan was
completed this week and had only limited effect on the market, and the
fact that most bonds were purchased by banks and stock dealers had
little effect on the market's money supply.
</P>
<P>
Middle-year reports for listed firms have been published and
investors are gradually gained increasing confidence. Local
experts predict a new round of upward trading on the
market.

<HEADLINE> Russian Government Denies Nuke Weapons Have Been Missing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Ministry today
denied former presidential adviser Alexander Lebed's remarks that
some of the country's suitcase-sized nuclear bombs were missing.
</P>
<P>
A ministry spokesman said there are no nuclear bombs in Russia
that are out of control of the Russian armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Lebed, former national security adviser to President Boris
Yeltsin, told CBS News, of the United States, that the Russian
military had lost track of over 100 suitcase-sized nuclear bombs.
</P>
<P>
In his response, the official spokesman, Vladimir Uvatenko,
said Lebed never dealt with nuclear security issues and was in no
way to have any knowledge in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Lebed's statement, Uvatenko said, "can cause nothing but a
smile."
</P>
<P>
It was impossible that the nuclear weapons would be stored
without being properly registered or had been used or destroyed
and not accounted for, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lebed said in the interview with the U.S. TV network that the
bombs, which can fit into a suitcase or backpack, can kill up to
100,000 people and devastate part of a city.
</P>
<P>
The former Yeltsin aide said he was not sure what had happened
to the missing bombs, but was certain they were not under the
control of the Russian military.
</P>
<P>
He speculated that the missing bombs could be in Georgia,
Ukraine, the Baltic nations or elsewhere.

TOKYO, September 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. aircraft carrier
"Independence" anchored at Otaru port on Japan's northernmost main
island of Hokkaido this morning, making it the first U.S. aircraft
carrier to dock at a civilian port in Japan, reports reaching here
said.
</P>
<P>
Naval authorities said the visit of the 80,643-ton carrier with
1,700 crewmen on board was aimed at strengthening friendly ties
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
However, the warship's arrival was met by some 2,300 people
from civic peace groups and labor unions who were protesting the
visit on grounds that the U.S. military was using the visit as a
test run for emergency situations covered by an ongoing review of
the Japan-U.S. Guidelines on Defence Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Residents marched through the streets of Otaru with banners
saying, "go home U.S. navy" after they learned that Otaru is a
candidate port for the U.S. military in the event of an emergency.
</P>
<P>
City officials said they received 533 requests from citizens
not to permit the visit by the Independence.
</P>
<P>
The Independence will leave Otaru, a popular tourist spot in
Hokkaido, on September 9.

<HEADLINE> Business Resumes in Liberia's Seaports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Traffic is returning to the two
main seaports of Liberia following the end of its seven-year
civil war, the Daily Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the main international airport is preparing to
reopen within weeks.
</P>
<P>
Reopening the ports and Robertsfield International Airport
outside the capital Monrovia are key objectives of President
Charles Taylor, the former warlord who won the July elections
ending the war he launched in December 1989.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted officials at Monrovia Free Port as saying
that the number of ships calling there and the Buchanan Port to
the southeast had risen markedly since Taylor was inaugurated on
August 2.
</P>
<P>
Ships carrying logs and rubber and those bringing in vehicles
and goods are calling at the port of Monrovia and Buchanan daily,
an ports spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Some have had to wait for days while others are unloading.
This increase really took off after the inauguration of the
president, Sidiki Trawally added.
</P>
<P>
He said port workers had resumed night shifts due to growing
traffic at the Monrovia Port, built in 1948 by the United States.
</P>
<P>
But no detailed traffic data are available.
</P>
<P>
The two ports and minor ones at Harper and Greenville are key
to any moves to revive an economy based on rubber, iron ore and
timber before war devastated the country.
</P>
<P>
Shipping was suspended during the war, and activity at the
ports depended on the state of the conflict and remained under
the control of the west African peace-keeping force known as
ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, ECOMOG lifted a shipping embargo along Liberia's
coastal waters, saying the zone is now safe with the formal end
of the civil war.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- With sentiment for a
near-term cut in official interest rates dispelled, the Australian
dollar strengthened against its U.S. counterpart today and closed
comfortably above 73 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 73.24 U.S. cents, compared with
yesterday's finish of 72.96.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Rallies Support for S. Africa's Olympic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria may have agreed to
rally support for South Africa's bid to host the 2004 Olympic
Games, as a result of a deal between the two leading African
countries.
</P>
<P>
"This Day" newspaper reported today that, by the deal, Nigeria
will help rally other African countries behind South Africa so
that Africa will be hosting the games for the first time since
1896, when the modern Olympic games were born.
</P>
<P>
The International Olympic Committee will vote today in
Lausanne, Switzerland, to choose the host of the games from Cape
Town, Stockolm, Athens, Rome and Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
By their joint effort, Nigeria and South Africa will make sure
that all the 20 votes for Africa will go to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Of the 111 votes to be cast today, Europe has 38, Asia and
Oceania 19 and the Americans 34.
</P>
<P>
The deal between Nigeria and South African is believed to be
struck during Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi's visit to S.
Africa earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi delivered a special message from Nigerian head of state,
General Sani Abacha to President Nelson Mandela. He denied that
the two countries have problems, saying that the relations are
cordial.
</P>
<P>
According to This Day's report, in return for Nigeria's
support, South Africa has agreed not to oppose Nigeria "in any
way" at the October Commonwealth Summit in Edinburgh, Scotland,
which will take the final decision on Nigeria's membership.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has also agreed to cooperate with Nigeria-led
ECOWAS (the Economic Community of West African States) in its
effort to restore the legitimate government of President Ahmed
Tejan Kabbah in Sierra Leone, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic relations between the two countries got sour in
1995, when South Africa led the campaign at the Auckland summit
that suspended Nigeria's Commonwealth membership.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Price Decline Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Last week's decline in wool
price was arrested during sales across three states in Australia
this week as the benchmark eastern market indicator climbed 17
Australian cents to 688 Australian cents (502 U.S. cents) a
kilogram.
</P>
<P>
An average increase in prices of between 2.5 and 3 percent at
sales in Sydney, Melbourne and Fremantle represented a welcome
turnaround in the market, the Australian Council of Wool Exporters
(ACWE) said.
</P>
<P>
"While the lower Australian dollar, a stronger European
presence and the level of Chinese inquiry, recent contractual
problems notwithstanding, help to explain market developments this
week, no-one in the trade has a clear or confident view of the
short-term outlook," the ACWE said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"At best exporters expect there will continue to be
fluctuations around 700 Australian cents (511 U.S. cents) a
kilogram clean benchmark as measured by Wool International's
eastern market indicators."
</P>
<P>
Sales will continue next week in the two coastal cities of
Sydney and Adelaide with 56,300 bales rostered for sale.

<P>
PARIS, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Four years after the signing of the Oslo peace agreements
between Israel and Palestinians, it is more and more difficult to
define the trail of the "peace process" which is dotted with the
bodies of the victims of blind attacks. The latest suicide attack
in Jerusalem is more aimed at U.S. President Bill Clinton than
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as it is aimed at
rejecting the new turning for the peace process with the visit by
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to Israel next week.
</P>
<P>
-- Hocine Ait-Ahmed, the head of the opposition Front of
Socialist Forces of Algeria, Thursday made an appeal to the
Socialist governments of Britain and France to "make an emergency
initiative in favor of the peace in Algeria." He thus reinforced
the initiative opened last week by United Nations Secretary
General Kofi Annan who, to the annoyment of the Algerian
authorities, appealed for an end of escalation of violence in
Algeria.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a bombing attack killed two and injured three in
Algiers on Thursday in the commercial district of Bouzareah.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Household taxes in France will increase by several billion
francs next year, according to the preliminary outline of a draft
budget law for 1998. The measure, described as indispensable for
maintaining state income at a normal level, will follow a drastic
increase of corporate taxes on enterprise interests which was
decided in July by the Socialist government of Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin.
</P>
<P>
-- The French government wants to keep Christian Blanc in the
seat of the president of Air France, the national carrier of
France. After a meeting between Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and
Blanc Thursday, the prime minister's office said that the
government hopes that Blanc will continue his mission but stressed
that privatization of Air France, which is demanded by Blanc, is
"not on the agenda."

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Open up New Prospect for China's Diplomacy in 1990s (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The third generation of the
collective leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC) with
Jiang Zemin at the core, steadfastly carrying out the independent
foreign policy of peace devised by their predecessors, has opened
up new prospects for China's diplomacy in the 1990s, especially
since the 14th CPC National Congress five years ago.
</P>
<P>
The third generation of the CPC collective leadership,
adhering to Deng Xiaoping's penetrating analysis of the
international situation and his strategic guiding principles on
diplomacy, have fully demonstrated their outstanding ability to
deal with diplomatic and international affairs under the
complicated situation that emerged after the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
China's diplomacy has flourished in a very active and
successful period since the beginning of the 1990s, during which
the relations between China and other countries around the world
have been universally improved and developed, especially the
friendly ties between China and its neighbors and the other
developing countries, on the basis of the Five Principles of
Peaceful Co-existence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China has been unremitting in its opposition of
outside actions that violate its sovereignty and interfere in its
internal affairs, thereby effectively safeguarding its state
sovereignty and national dignity.
</P>
<P>
China's international status and its influence in international
affairs continue to improve and the country has forged diplomatic
relations with 160 countries throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
The world entered a period of transition from the old structure
to a new one after the Cold War. The third generation of the CPC
collective leadership, under the changing and severe international
situation, consistently abiding by the principles of "one focus"
of economic construction and "two basic points" of adherence to
the four cardinal principles and to the reform and opening up to
the outside world, and holding fast to the two major issues of
peace and development in today's world, has put forward and
implemented a series of principles and policies concerning
bilateral and multi-lateral relations, and has achieved remarkable
successes in diplomatic work.

China has also increased and consolidated the ties with its
neighbors and with developing countries since the beginning of the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
-- The relations between China and its neighbors and other
Asian countries have entered a new period of good-neighborly
cooperation since the 1990s. Major progress has been made by China
and its neighbors in settling issues left over from history,
demarcating boundary lines and in promoting economic and trade
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese President Jiang Zemin's state visits to the
Philippines, India, Pakistan and Nepal have confirmed the
development direction of the relations between China and the four
countries in the next century. China and India signed an
important agreement on increasing mutual trust. President Jiang
also elaborated China's policy towards South Asia during his visit
to the region.
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese leaders' visits to Vietnam, the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea and ASEAN countries, along
with the fact that China became the full dialogue partner of the
ASEAN last year have elevated the relations between China and
those states to a new level.
</P>
<P>
-- Sino-Japanese ties have generally maintained a good
development momentum in recent years. China and Japan, two major
neighboring countries in east Asia, have scored progress in their
cooperation in every area. the year 1997 marks the 25th
anniversary of the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations, and
China hopes that Japan will acknowledge and properly approach the
historical issues, and abide by the basic principles guiding
Sino-Japanese ties to boost bilateral relations in a healthy,
stable and long-term fashion.
</P>
<P>
-- The relations between China and developing countries have
been constantly increased and strengthened. China, the world's
largest developing country, and the other developing countries
have always supported each other in international affairs and
their links have been expanded in every field on the basis of
equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
China put forward a five-point suggestion concerning
Sino-African relations and a five-point principle guiding
Sino-Latin American ties during Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
visit to Africa last year and during Premier Li Peng's visit to
Latin America, respectively, which promoted the political and
economic cooperation with the two continents and their common
development.
</P>
<P>
-- Premier Li Peng's visit to six African countries this year
not only has helped increase Sino-African traditional friendship,
but also has helped enhance the economic and trade collaboration
between the two sides under the current new situation.
</P>
<P>
-- China established diplomatic relations this year with the
Bahamas and St Lucia in Central America and the Cook Islands in
the South Pacific. South Africa also announced that it would forge
diplomatic ties with China by the end of this year.

China and Russia have set up a strategic and cooperative
partnership oriented towards the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Since the normalization of the Sino-Russian relations in 1992,
the relations between the two countries have been developing
steadily and soundly. Russian President Boris Yeltsin's two trips
to China and Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to Russia last
April have helped push the bilateral relations to a new stage of
comprehensive and deepened development.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia, as big neighboring countries, have vowed to
set up a 21st century-oriented strategic and cooperative
partnership of equality and mutual trust, based on non-alignment,
non-confrontation and not targeting any third party. Such an
innovative relationship is conducive to maintaining regional and
global peace and security, conforms to the trend and needs of the
current world situation and the development of international
relations, while providing the necessary space for forming ideas
about relations between big countries under the new situation.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on strengthening trust on military-occupied land
in border areas and the agreement on mutual reduction of military
forces in border areas signed by China, Russia and three Central
Asian countries have successfully solved the issue of the
stability and peace of the more than 7000-kilometer long border
areas.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Russia last April, President Jiang Zemin
and President Yeltsin also signed a joint statement on the world's
multi-polarization. The establishment of a new world order has made
contributions to promoting the process of global multi-polarization
and the establishment of new international political and economic
orders characterized by peace and stability, justice and reason.

China has disregarded the so-called "sanctions" imposed by the
western countries and quashed the attempt to split and
westernize China by the international anti-China forces. The
relations between China and the western countries have been
gradually improved and developed.
</P>
<P>
-- Sino-European ties, especially China's ties with
Germany, France and other western European nations, are growing
continuously. During his visit to Germany in 1995, President Jiang
Zemin pointed out that mutual respect, seeking common ground while
preserving differences, equality and mutual benefit are the basic
principles guiding Sino-Western European relations.
</P>
<P>
-- Premier Li Peng, during the Asia-Europe Summit in March
1996, summarized five characteristics for the new partnership
between Asia and Europe: mutual respect and treating each other
equally; seeking common ground while preserving differences and
learning from each other; promoting mutual understanding and
establishing mutual trust; mutual benefit and mutual complement
with each other's strong points; keeping an eye to the future and
joint development. These principles have laid down a solid
foundation for the constant growth of Sino-European relations.
</P>
<P>
-- French President Jacque Chirac's successful visit to China
this year boosted Sino-French ties, especially bilateral economic
and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
-- Sino-US relations, after a period of twists and turns, have
headed in a positive direction toward improvement and development
since the second half of last year. This year there have been
continuous high-level contacts between the two countries. US
Vice-President Al Gore, Speaker of House of Representatives Newt
Gingrich, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and dozens of US
congress members visited China.
</P>
<P>
Also, the Chinese military fleet toured the US mainland for the
first time. President Jiang Zemin's upcoming state visit to the US
this fall will surely mark a milestone for the further advancement
of Sino-US relations.
</P>
<P>
The growth of Sino-US ties suffered a serious setback in 1995
when the US allowed Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan to visit it. During the
last four Sino-US summits, President Jiang pointed out that
handling Sino-US relations, both sides should abide by the basic
policy of "increasing mutual trust, reducing troubles, developing
cooperation and refraining from confrontation", and the two
presidents have reached consensus on the principle of developing
Sino-US ties.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang also proposed recently that Chinese and US
leaders should look at the overall situation of bilateral ties
from a strategic point of view, adhere to the principles of mutual
respect, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, and
consultations on an equal footing, try to "expand common
understranding, increase trust, reduce differences and jointly
build the future."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China adheres to the principles concerning the
issues of Taiwan, bilateral trade and human rights, having thus
safeguarded its sovereignty and dignity.
</P>
<P>
-- The smooth return of Hong Kong and the coming return of
Macao to the motherland marks the victory of the great concept of
"one country, two systems" put forward by Deng Xiaoping. It also
shows the diplomatic wisdom of the current third generation of
China's collective leadership, who overcame the obstacles imposed
by the British Hong Kong government during the transitional period
of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
With the return of Hong Kong, a trend toward improvement and
growth in Sino-British relations has also gradually emerged. The
good cooperation between China and Portugal on the issues
concerning Macao's return to China will serve for the smooth
handover of Macao and reflects the stable ties between China and
Portugal.
</P>
<P>
-- The successful implementation of the "one country, two
systems" concept is of great significance to the peaceful
reunification of the motherland.

China has been striving to establish fair and reasonable
international political and economic orders.
</P>
<P>
Toward this end, China has actively participated in
multilateral and international activities. At international
affairs, China has safeguarded its sovereignty, upheld justice and
opposed hegemony and power politics.
</P>
<P>
As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China has
played a unique and active role in UN affairs.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng join multilateral
diplomatic activities. In the past four years, Jiang attended the
informal meeting of the APEC leaders every year. Premier Li
attended the Asia-Europe Summit, the Social Development Summit and
the World Food Summit.
</P>
<P>
China successfully hosted the UN Fourth World Conference on
Women in 1995 and the 96th Interparliament Conference in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Through these activities, China has won extensive support from
the international community on issues about sovereignty and
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders clearly expounded at many international
occasions China's position and principled stand on the
establishment of new international political and economic orders.
</P>
<P>
China holds that:
</P>
<P>
-- All countries - big or small, strong or weak, rich or poor -
are equal members of the international community and have the
right to participate in and handle international affairs;
</P>
<P>
-- All countries have the right to choose their own social
system, ideology, economic mode and development path;
</P>
<P>
-- All countries should respect each other's sovereignty and
territorial integrity, maintain mutual non-aggression and
non-interference in each other's internal affairs;
</P>
<P>
-- International conflicts should be settled peacefully through
dialogues, and all forms of bullying and pressuring by big, strong
and rich powers on small, weak and poor ones should be opposed;
</P>
<P>
-- All countries should abide by the principle of equality,
mutual benefit, mutual support, mutual advancement, and mutual
complement with each other's strong points in economic changes and
in global and regional economic cooperation, and should
not discriminate against each other or practice trade protectionism
of any form, let alone impose sanctions from time to time; and
</P>
<P>
-- The developed nations have the responsibility to help the
developing countries to boost their economy in an effort to narrow
the North-South gap.
</P>
<P>
In the area of human rights, China advocates dialogue and
cooperation and opposes using human rights as an excuse for
interfering into other countries' internal affairs. This position
represents the aspiration of the developing countries and is
supported by the international community.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, China has, for seven times, frustrated the
anti-China act proposed by a small number of western countries at
the Geneva Conference on Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
China also actively participated in the process of disarmament,
making a active contribution to comprehensive and thorough
disarmament. China actively joined the talks and played an active
part in forming the treaty for a complete ban on nuclear tests and
becomes one of the first group of countries to sign the treaty.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China has reiterated many times its defensive
policy of national defense and refuted the so-called "China
threat" notion spread purposely by a small number of people
abroad.

China's all-round diplomatic work has served the growth of its
national economy.
</P>
<P>
After the Cold War, the role of economic factors has become
more prominent in international relations and more countries are
shifting their strategic focus to economy, and the world economy
is entering a daily close cooperation.
</P>
<P>
With this in the background, the third generation of Chinese
leaders work to make the country's diplomatic work serve the focus
of developing the national economy.
</P>
<P>
The CPC, the National People's Congress (NPC) and
non-governmental organizations have all seen to it that exchanges
with their foreign counterparts serve to create a favorable
environment for building socialism with Chinese characteristics
and a socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders regarded developing bilateral economic and
trade ties as an important mission of their visits to other
countries and took every opportunity to promote China's
participation in regional and world economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The fast, sustainable and healthy growth of China's economy for
more than a decade, with the help of "economic diplomacy," has
accelerated the development of the economy and trade between China
and other countries.
</P>
<P>
China has become the world's biggest potential market and one
of the countries which used much foreign capital since the
beginning of the 1990s. More and more countries support China's
entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
The CPC has established relations and conducted friendly
exchanges with more than 300 political parties in over 120
countries throughout the world. Those political parties not only
include ruling parties but also parties not in power.

The foreign contacts of the NPC effectively serves China's

various fields, and in promoting the development of China's

links with parliaments in some 40 countries and set up bilateral
friendship groups with over 40 foreign parliaments.
</P>
<P>
The NPC has become a member or observer of some parliamentary
organizations and conferences such as the Inter-Parliament Union,
the Asia-Pacific Parliamentary Forum and the Asian Forum of
Parliamentarians on Population and Development.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
has also become an important force in promoting the development of
relations between China and other countries.
</P>
<P>
The 21st Century Forum, hosted by the CPPCC in 1996, attracted
statesmen from dozens of countries all over the world, who
discussed regional security, economic cooperation and other major
issues. The forum helped increased mutual understanding between
countries concerned.
</P>
<P>
In addition, non-government foreign contacts at different
levels have conducted various forms of friendly exchanges with
other countries in economy, trade, science, technology and
culture, contributing to the overall development of China's
foreign relations.
</P>
<P>
There are now some 700 pairs of sister cities between China and
other countries.
</P>
<P>
The verses of a poem by late Chinese leader Mao Zedong
accurately describe China's successes in its foreign relations in
recent years:
</P>
<P>
"The day will soon break in the east, Say not 'you are an early
bird to start.' Having traversed all the hills I am not old in
the least, Only to find the scenery here plays the fairest part."
</P>
<P>
At the turn of the century, the third generation of Chinese
leaders appear ready to face all challenges and opportunities in
the international situation and are fully confident they can bring
a prosperous and strong China into the 21st century.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Foreign Reserves Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' gross
international reserves (GIR) rose to 10.55 billion U.S. dollars as
of September 2, after a currency crisis reduced the country's
reserves by 1 billion dollars nearly two months ago.
</P>
<P>
"This is a significant 1 billion dollar recovery from the July
18 level of 9.3 billion dollars, a week after the bank announced
that it was allowing the foreign exchange rate to move within a
wider band," Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson said in a
statement released here today.
</P>
<P>
He said the amount of the current international reserves is
equivalent to about 2.8 months' imports of goods and services for
the country.
</P>
<P>
Singson attributed the latest recovery to the International
Monetary Fund's Extended Fund Facility amounting to 700 million
dollars, and deposits of the loan proceeds from the Japanese
Eximbank IMF Parallel Loan and the purchase of proceeds from the
Development Bank of the Philippines' bond floatation.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines' gross international reserves declined to 9.3
billion dollars by July 18 after the central bank spent 1.9
billion dollars in 40 days on defending the peso against
speculators.

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani Criticizes Turkey for Joint War Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran's former president Hashemi
Rafsanjani today criticized Turkey for holding joint naval
maneuvers with Israel and the United States "at a time when
Israeli forces are continuing their attacks on Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
He expressed regret that Turkey, "a large Muslim nation
with 60 million Muslim, will be holding military maneuvers with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Now chairman of the State Expediency Council to advise
incumbent President Mohammad Khatami on policies-making,
Rafsanjani made the remarks in his sermon to the Friday prayers at
Tehran University.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Foreign Ministry on Wednesday strongly denounced the
Israel-US-Turkey joint military maneuvers scheduled for
mid-November in east Mediterranean off the coast of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said "Iran
considers Turkey a member of the Islamic community and rejects
its cooperation with the Zionist regime as detrimental to the
interests of Muslims in the region."
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Syria have already expressed their opposition to
the Israel-US-Turkey war games.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to soothe the anger of its Arab neighbors, Ankara
has repeated said the exercises were for search and rescue
operations and not directed against any other country.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani also criticized Arab countries for being "easily
tricked by Israel." The Arabs should have continued to
boycott Israel and should have never established ties with
Israel through agreements, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Arabs who fasted for 50 years, who boycotted, and refused
to talk, with Israel, ... broke their fast with sinful food," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Trade Balance Worsens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's import bill
amounted to 126.4 million U.S. Dollars compared to 42.2 million
Dollars earned from exports, representing a yawning trade deficit
of 84.2 million Dollars in the first seven months this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Bank of Tanzania (BOT), the trade deficit rose to
48.5 million Dollars from last January's 33.7 million Dollars,
and it scaled further to 76.7 million Dollars in the following
month.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's Monthly Economic Review for August 1997,
which is available here this week, said that exports have
unceasingly shrunk since the beginning of the year. By July the
country realized less than half of what it spent on imports.
</P>
<P>
BOT attributed the yawning trade deficit to poor performance
of traditional commodities and a simultaneous increase in the
import bill.
</P>
<P>
The poor performance of traditional export crops is attributed
to drought that hit the country toward the end of last year and
early this year. Many regions have since reported crop failure
and the country is on the verge of famine as a result of the
below normal rainfall this year.
</P>
<P>
Among the traditional cash earners, chiefly coffee, cotton,
tobacco, sisal, tea and cashew nuts, only sisal and tea recorded
increases in export volumes in July as compared to June.
</P>
<P>
However, earnings from the few non-traditional exports,
including minerals, manufactured goods, cotton yarn, processed
coffee and horticultural products, have been rising.
</P>
<P>
The central bank is of the view that the country's economy
could have been healthier if it diversified its exports.

<HEADLINE> China Striving to Strengthen Trade Ties with Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, September 5 (Xinhua) -- China will promote cooperation
with African countries in all fields and expand trade and economic
links between the two sides, according to Vice-Premier Li Lanqing.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to a national workshop on economic and trade
cooperation with Africa which ended today in Dalian, Li said
Africa has abundant resources, a vast market and great potential
for development. Over the past few decades, China has attached
importance to expanding economic and trade links with African
countries. China has provided gratis aid free of any political
conditions to promote economic growth in Africa. African countries
have expressed sincere gratitude for the invaluable help provided
by China.
</P>
<P>
The three-day workshop, the first of its kind held in China,
focused on studying arrangements for strengthening economic and
trade cooperation with Africa.
</P>
<P>
Li said China will place additional impetus on economic and
trade cooperation with Africa and will extend the scope of
cooperation, and that China will pursue a strategy of developing
economic and trade links through all channels, providing high
quality goods and services, and building diversified markets.
</P>
<P>
China will accelerate reforming its overseas aid program, and
will promote all forms of cooperation between enterprises of the
two sides in order to put a new face on economic and trade
cooperation between China and Africa, he added.
</P>
<P>
Li pointed to the fact that China is the largest developing
country, while Africa is the largest developing continent. He said
the common historical mission, development goals and interests of
the two sides have promoted cooperation between China and Africa
on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
He said that cooperation is not only of great strategic
significance for economic growth of Asia and Africa in the next
century, but also for "South-South" cooperation and the overall
peace and stability of the world. He added that cooperation will
expand the dimensions of China's opening drive and will inject
new vigor into the country's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the symposium conducted highly-beneficial
exploration into how to strengthen all-round cooperation with
Africa.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong People Confident of Future: Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong people are
confident as they move into the 21st century and have the
commitment to making "One Country, Two Systems" a success, Tung
Chee Hwa, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR), said here today.
</P>
<P>
This year Hong Kong is expecting more than 80,000 people to
come back from overseas to live in Hong Kong, a figure higher than
the balance of more than 60,000 last year, Tung, who arrived here
on Thursday for a three-day visit, told an audience of 400 leading
businessmen, government officials and diplomats at a luncheon
talk.
</P>
<P>
"They are coming back because they feel the pride and sense the
opportunities. They want to take part in the making of history,"
the chief executive said, describing this as "what better
testimony to our level of confidence."
</P>
<P>
Elaborating on the grounds of Hong Kong people's confidence in
their future, Tung said the first reason for confidence is in
China itself, in Hong Kong people's understanding of what China is
trying to achieve and its ability to do so and of its commitment
to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said today's Chinese leaders are fully committed to making
"One Country, Two Systems" work. "They have complete faith in the
ability of Hong Kong people in administering Hong Kong and have
pledged their full support for us," he added.
</P>
<P>
"I can testify to this commitment from my experience over the
past eight months. The central government has given us a free hand
in dealing with our own affairs and has demonstrated flexibility,
understanding, cooperation and accommodation," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"There is every reason for China to want Hong Kong to succeed.
The economic interests of Hong Kong and China are intertwined. I
firmly believe that if Hong Kong succeeds, China will benefit. And
if China is prosperous, Hong Kong will benefit even more. This
complementary relationship provides a solid foundation on which
'One Country, Two Systems' will work," he continued.
</P>
<P>
He also said that apart from the trust in China, there is the
solid foundation Hong Kong people have in the fiscal management by
the SAR government, the civil service, and fundamentally, in the
rule of law, all of which he said are being kept unchanged.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to provide a stable economic environment,
playing a supporting and facilitating role, in which the private
sector can maximize its contribution and make the best use of the
opportunities available," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, "we will remain resolutely international in
outlook, welcoming foreign investment and the operation of
multinational firms, and working in the WTO (World Trade
Organization) and in APEC (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation) to
promote greater integration in the global economy," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The National Ballet Troupe of
China (NBTC) will stage two classics ballets -- "Sleeping Beauty"
and "Swan Lake" -- between September 27 - October 7 in Beijing as
part of the '97 China International Opera and Ballet Year.
</P>
<P>
The NBTC staged a number of ballet classics earlier this year,
including "Don Quixote", "the Nutcracker" and "Giselle". The
troupe also staged the modern Chinese ballet "The Red Detachment
of Women" last month to the delight of the local audience.
</P>
<P>
The China Performing Arts Agency (CPAA), the organizer,
announced that the NBTC has invited Monica Parker and William
Tuckett, two famous artists with the British Royal Ballet Troupe,
to assist Chinese dancers during the rehearsals of "Sleeping
Beauty".
</P>
<P>
Yuan Ping, an official with CPAA, said the agency has organized
numerous cultural exchanges between the NBTC and leading ballet
troupes from Russia, Sweden, France, Britain, and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Chinese artists have exerted great efforts to improve ballet
performances in recent years, Yuan said, adding that the CPAA has
developed a large market for excellent NBTC performances which
have enabled Chinese audience to learn more about the art form.
</P>
<P>
NBTC Director Zhao Ruheng noted that a number of Chinese
dancers have won gold medals in international competitions over
the past five years. "Their performances represent the country's
highest standard of ballet," according to this Chinese ballerina
who has performed with a number of famous foreign ballet dancers
and troupes.

<P>
NAIROBI, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Vice-President George
Saitoti today said his government had denounced recent violent
actions in the port city of Mombasa and its environs, the Kenyan
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted him as saying in London that the government
is working swiftly to restore law and order in the violence hit
areas in the Coast Province.
</P>
<P>
Saitoti who is also Minister for Planning and National
Development reiterated that whoever was involved in the mayhem in
Likoni and other places in the coast areas would be dealt with
law.
</P>
<P>
He defended the Kenyan government from complicity in the
lawless actions which occurred in Coast Province during the past
fortnight.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan leader underlined the government's commitment to
constitutional reforms contrary to wrong impression that there
were hard-liners in the ruling Kenya African National Union
(KANU) who were opposed to reforms.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed the National Convention Executive Council (NCEC)
as a body with no mandate to hold constitutional reforms talks
with KANU.
</P>
<P>
The NCEC, an umbrella body of reform activists and Opposition
parties, yesterday released its mass action program to force the
government to initiate "meaningful dialogue" for the
constitutional reforms before the general elections to be held
later this year.
</P>
<P>
In response, the Inter-Party Parliamentary Group (IPPG)
Thursday appealed to Kenyans to ignore calls for mass action by
the NCEC.
</P>
<P>
The IPPG comprising Members of Parliament from the ruling and
Opposition parties replaced the NCEC to undertake constitutional
reforms talk between KANU and Opposition parties.

NAIROBI, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) has "vehemently condemned" the military
expulsion of Rwandan and Burundi refugees from the Democratic

</P>

<HEADLINE> Philippine Stock Exchange Not to Limit Stock Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Stock Exchange
(PSE) clarified today that it has not recommended the limiting of
stock sales to actual physical holdings of certificates.
</P>
<P>
Instead, PSE President Jose Luis Yulo said in a statement, the
PSE is finalizing rules and regulations for short selling.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to some newspaper reports that the PSE will limit
stock sales to cope with the recent decline of the stock market,
Yulo said that PSE will not ask for a lock-up period for foreign
funds invested in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that he only suggested ways to expand and deepen
the local investor base by way of developing the mutual fund
industry, and to find a mechanism for government and private local
funds to invest in the market.
</P>
<P>
Yulo recommended on Thursday that the solution to stock market
woes should be to get government and local private funds to invest
in the equities market, particularly when there is an outflow of
foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Securities and Exchange Commission asked the PSE
to explain why there was a sharp decline in the PSE Index,
especially after the July 11 peso depreciation whose effects have
somehow resulted in the prevailing currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
Yulo further said the PSE called for the lowering or
eliminating of taxes on stock transactions, documentary stamp tax
and the value-added tax.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the principle of the PSE is to advocate for a
free and fair play of market forces in a global economy.

<HEADLINE> 11 ECOMOG Soldiers Killed in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has confirmed the death
of 11 soldiers of the west African peacekeeping force (ECOMOG)
when they ran into land mines planted by the military junta in
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Another three peace-keepers were seriously wounded in land
mine blasts on Wednesday, according to a statement from the
ECOMOG headquarters in Liberia, which reached here today.
</P>
<P>
The peace-keepers conveying foodstuff from Lungi, where Sierra
Leone's international airport is located, to troops in Jui were
blown by the land mines planted around the farmland at Lungi
village, said the statement, faxed by the press secretary to
ECOMOG force commander, Biola Lawal.
</P>
<P>
Another statement of Nigeria's Defense Headquarters confirmed
Thursday that the junta had intensified the laying of land mines
on ECOMOG routes in Lungi to Freetown, Bo, Kenema and other
important towns in the hinterland.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, both the junta and ECOMOG were on Thursday
exchanging allegations of being attacked by the other side, which
reports said had claimed 50 lives with 120 injured as on Thursday
evening.
</P>
<P>
One account said the Nigerian-led ECOMOG troops had opened
fire at two container ships which violated the economic embargo
against the troubled country ordered by west African leaders.
</P>
<P>
But the Defense Headquarters in Lagos said the junta opened
fire on ECOMOG base at Lungi near Freetown as a fallout of
Wednesday's meeting between the junta leader Major Johnny Koroma
and his aides and military commanders.

<HEADLINE> Cities Encouraged To Clean Themselves While Developing Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- China conferred the title of
"Model City in Environmental Protection" today on the five coastal
cities of Xiamen, Dalian, Zhuhai, Shenzhen and Weihai.
</P>
<P>
The title is the country's highest honor in the field. The
cities which receive the recognition must have an overall clean
environment while witnessing rapid social and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
East China's Zhangjiagang earned the honor last year.
</P>
<P>
Xie Zhenhua, director of the National Environmental Protection
Agency (Nepa) said during a press conference here today that the
selection of model cities in environmental protection will further
push forward the country's urban pollution control, and the
improvement of urban environment and people's quality of life.
</P>
<P>
He added that it has great significance for carrying out the
strategy of sustainable development in urban areas and for
bringing the country closer to the world.
</P>
<P>
Ever since China decided to choose model cities in
environmental protection this June, many cities have responded
enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that candidates are assessed in terms of economy,
environment quality, environmental protection and management. More
than 20 indices, including economic growth rate, air pollution
index, sewage treatment rate and natural reserve coverage rate,
were used in the judging.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said that the five cities, although different in
size, industrial structure and course of development, have
witnessed steady and healthy growth over the years. Their social
and economic growth level and environmental quality all take the
lead in the country.
</P>
<P>
Nepa said that it will regularly check the six cities that have
received recognition, and recall the title of any who fall short
of the requirements.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Bank to Deal With Currency Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Central Bank
said today that it will take the necessary steps to deal with the
peso depreciation by introducing a package of monetary measures.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson said in a statement that
the measures are expected to strengthen the government's financial
policy to guard against further speculative attacks on the local
currency. But he did not give details of the measures.
</P>
<P>
The governor said the peso flotation is handled much better
this time than in 1990 and 1993, adding that full information on
the currency crisis has been provided to the public.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the government's price monitoring program has
been stepped up in key areas such as Metro Manila and other major
cities.
</P>
<P>
To avoid unnecessary pressure from the industrial sector, the
government maintained close links with labor and management,
banks, and even oil firms to ensure that nothing would get out of
control, he said.
</P>
<P>
Singson expressed confidence that the peso depreciation which
took effect on July 11 will have minimal impact on the country's
inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
Price increase is less than half of the July 1996 level of 8.9
percent, thus bringing the average inflation rate for the
January-July period to 4.63 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that the July inflation will trace a
continually reasonable inflation path for the rest of the year,"
Singson said.

<HEADLINE> China Reports Early Rice Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- China's early rice harvest has
hit 45.78 million tons, up 4.5 percent on last year, according to
a report released here today by the State Statistical Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Seven of the country's nine major producers of early rice
reported output increases, with the sole exceptions being Jiangxi
and Zhejiang provinces.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the good harvest to the widespread use of
agricultural science and technology. The per hectare output jumped
by some 320 kg, with a 2.6 million ton total increase in output of
early rice.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels played a major role in the harvest.
For example, Guangdong Province introduced a seed project and
provided four million yuan in funding to establish a seed risk
fund. Fujian Province allocated 130 million yuan to continue an
ongoing project to transform 30 counties into grain production
bases, and promote grain self-sufficiency in an additional 23
counties.
</P>
<P>
Stable prices for agricultural production equipment and
materials also contributed to the good harvest. Price indices for
agricultural materials dropped nationwide, with the sole exception
of an 0.8 percent rise in the price index for pesticides.
</P>
<P>
Relatively good weather conditions also contributed to this
year's early rice harvest.
</P>
<P>
Chinese farmers planted early rice on 8.16 million ha, down
some 120,000 ha on 1996. According to the report, the reduced area
was mainly due to the falling grain prices which accompanied the
previous year's harvest.

<HEADLINE> Asian Economies to Be on Track of Growth Soon: Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The chief executive of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), today expressed the
confidence that Asian economies will soon be back on the path of
prosperity, despite recent financial turmoil in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
"The fundamentals of the Asian economies are good. Therefore we
should not lose heart. I am sure that we will soon be back on the
path to prosperity," Tung Chee Hwa said while addressing 400
leading businessmen, government officials and diplomats at a
luncheon talk here on "Hong Kong After the Transition."
</P>
<P>
The recent turmoil in Southeast Asian financial and stock
markets has come as a blow to many hopes in the region and this is
a deep frustration felt by all, he said, adding that Hong Kong,
likewise, did not escape the speculative pressures.
</P>
<P>
However, "we should not lose sight of the fact that the opening
up of our economies and markets has brought great benefits," he
said. But he was quick to add that it is also important to
remember that "the process does mean becoming open, as well, to
pressures from outside, pressures that can expose our internal
weaknesses."
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong learned, as a leading financial center in
Asia, that the proper response to these pressures is to regulate
properly.
</P>
<P>
"Our experience is that the risks of the open market can be
managed by making the market operate as transparently and
efficiently as possible, by maintaining financial discipline in
the public sector, and by ensuring that financial institutions
manage their investments and risks properly," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Tung has been here since Thursday on a three-day visit and is
scheduled to wind up his Southeast Asia tour Saturday morning.

said here today that the foremost task of his administration is to
enhance Hong Kong's economic vitality and sustain economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"My government will create a business environment and provide
an educated and well-trained workforce that will promote the
services sector and the development of value-added and high
technology industries," Tung said at a luncheon talk on "Hong Kong
After the Transition" attended by 400 leading businessmen,

</P>
<P>
Highlighting education as the key to the future of Hong Kong,
the chief executive said his government is aiming to give every
child in Hong Kong "a modern, well-balanced education of the
highest quality, to extend opportunities for lifetime learning and
retraining."
</P>
<P>
"We trust that Hong Kong may become a center for excellence in
education in Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that ownership of a home is crucial for personal
security and social stability, Tung said his government will speed
up reclamation and land formation over the next 10 years and
increase substantially the production of housing units.
</P>
<P>
"We will increase overall housing supply at a target of not
less than 85,000 flats a year and aim to achieve a home ownership
rate of 70 percent in 10 years," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the SAR government is paying particular attention
to the rising population of the elderly. He said his
administration has set up a "Commission for the Elderly" and is
developing "a comprehensive policy to provide them with a sense of
security, a sense of belonging and a sense of worthiness."
</P>
<P>
He said that during his visit here, he is particularly
interested in the fields of education and housing.
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman of Tung's delegation, housing,
education and information technology were the focus of the talks
between Tung and Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong on
Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
During the hour-long talks, described by a Singapore Foreign
Ministry spokesman as "warm and friendly," Tung and Goh discussed
Singapore's housing policy, especially in regard to price
stabilization.
</P>
<P>
On education, the two leaders focused on the medium of
instruction and the promotion of bilingual education.
</P>
<P>
This morning, Tung visited Singapore's Chinese High School
where he was briefed by Minister for Education Teo Chee Hean on
Singapore's education policies. Tung is also scheduled to tour the
Toa Payoh housing estate in the central part of Singapore and
visit two families there this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Tung arrived here on Thursday for a three-day visit as part of
his first overseas trip since taking office on July 1. Before

<HEADLINE> Heavy Fighting Breaks Out in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Heavy fighting launched by
Lebanese army and resistance fighters against Israeli troops took
place again in south Lebanon early this morning, killing at least
12 Israeli soldiers, Lebanese security officials said.
</P>
<P>
However, this figure can not be independently confirmed.
</P>
<P>
The fighting began when two Israeli helicopters landed
commandos in the village of Insariyeh, more than 40 kilometers
south from Beirut and killed two civilians and wounded six,
Lebanese Orient Radio quoted the officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The village is believed to be used as a stronghold by the
Shiite Muslim militant Amal fighters, led by the country's House
Speaker Nabih Berri, to attack Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli raid was reported to be a retaliation for last
week's Amal attack in which five Israeli soldiers were killed.
</P>
<P>
Two Israeli gunships also joined the battle, strafing and
rocketing the nearby villages of Adloun and Saksakieh, also known
as Amal strongholds.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese army unleashed a heavy barrage of anti-aircraft fire
against the Israeli attacking gunships and four others that were
hovering to provide cover.
</P>
<P>
Hezbullah, or Party of God, quickly rushed fighters to help
their Amal allies, according to the security officials.

Hunan and Henan provinces in central China, Shanxi and Hebei
provinces in the north, Anhui province in the east, Heilongjiang
province in the northeast, and Yunan province in the
southwest. All of them were traditionally thought of as having
lukewarm tourist appeal.

<P>
Of them, the top three are Hubei, Anhui and Shanxi, with a
growth rate of 104 percent, 99 percent and 75 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Sun Gang, Vice Chairman of the National Tourism
Administration, deems that the high growth illustrates good
tourism prospects for those regions where scenic sites abound.
</P>
<P>
The growing interest of overseas tourists in the Chinese market
is another reason for the high growth. According to Sun, travel
agencies in Europe, North America, Japan and the Republic of Korea
have already made central and western China a focus for expansion
of their business.
</P>
<P>
Sun also attributed the progress to local governments'
attention on developing tourism. In the early 1990s,
many provincial governments listed tourism as a pillar industry
which enjoys preferential policies.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Why Southeast Asian Currencies Continue                    to Slide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Two months after a currency
crisis swept across Southeast Asia, there are no signs of an end
of the turmoil on the region's currency markets today and no one
can predict when Southeast Asian currencies will stop falling.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Malaysia's ringgit fell to a new record low of
2.991 against the U.S. dollar from Wednesday's close of 2.973
while the Philippine peso plunged to a new record low of 32.41
from 31.70 to the dollar and the Indonesian rupiah dived to an
all-time low of 3,060.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore dollar also slid to 1.5195 against the greenback
from Wednesday's close of 1.5185 while the Thai baht was traded at
35.45 offshore, down from 35.50.
</P>
<P>
During the past two months, Southeast Asian governments have
taken a series of measures to prevent the continuous fall of their
currencies, including central bank interventions in the markets,
higher interest rates and monetary disciplines to check
speculations.
</P>
<P>
However, none of these measures seems effective enough to check
the downward trend of the region's currencies.
</P>
<P>
Analysts cited a couple of reasons for the steady depreciation
of Southeast Asian currencies. One of them is a possible economic
slowdown in the region in the latter part of this year and in next
year, the first bitter pill Southeast Asian countries may have to
swallow after the currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
Since the Thai currency crisis spilled over in the region in
early July, Southeast Asian currencies have devalued between 10
percent to over 20 percent. As one of the measures to stabilize
their currencies, central banks have raised interest rates. But
higher interest rates make it harder for companies to get the cash
they need to expand.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector in the region has already been hurt by
higher interest rates and higher cost of foreign debt payments due
to weaker currencies and a production slowdown is unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest forecast by economists, most Southeast
Asian countries would experience economic slowdowns in 1997 and
1998. Their growth rates would be a bit lower than the government
targets.
</P>
<P>
The signs of an economic slowdown in the region have undermined
the confidence of foreign investors, whose selling of currencies
in the region has caused the continuous market turmoil, economists
said.
</P>
<P>
The lack of joint efforts by Southeast Asian countries to
strike back at the speculators is another main reason for the
continuous fall of currencies in the region.
</P>
<P>
In the last two months, Southeast Asian countries intervened in
the markets whenever their currencies were under strong
speculative attack. But as their foreign reserves were limited and
their interventions were not a collective effort, these countries
could hardly succeed in defending their currencies.
</P>
<P>
Realizing the failure, Southeast Asian finance ministers will
meet in Bangkok on September 17 to discuss ways of dealing with
the crisis. The topics will include a proposal to set up an ASEAN
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations) fund that could be used
by member countries affected by currency instability.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the spillover effect is also a major factor which
often leads to currency falls in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Southeast Asian countries are facing some similar economic
problems, such as high current account deficit, oversupply of
office and residential buildings and huge non-performing bank
loans. Whenever a country's internal problems cause currency
falls, other currencies in the region will also be dragged lower
for psychological reasons.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, when debt default by Thailand's largest finance
company Finance One prompted the Thai baht to plummet by 7
percent, the Malaysian ringgit, the Indonesian rupiah and the
Philippine peso were also affected and hit record lows against the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
"There is no way one can be positive on Southeast Asian
currencies at this stage. The other Southeast Asian countries are
taking their cues from Thailand and developing their own internal
problems," said Vincent Low, a regional-currency strategist at
Merrill Lynch International Bank in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Judging from the current situation in the region, some
economists said the market turmoil may last at least another month
or two and Southeast Asian currencies could fall further.

<HEADLINE> Loans Alleviate Grain Storage Problems in Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese banks have granted
loans with discounted interest to help alleviate grain storage
problems in major grain producing areas in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
The successive grain harvests in recent years have resulted in
the lack of adequate grain storage depots. According to recent
estimates, almost half of harvested grain is stored in the open
air for extended periods.
</P>
<P>
However, since the end of last year, state banks have issued
special loans of 950 million yuan (11.45 million US dollars) to
help expand the grain storage capacity of Liaoning, Jilin and
Heilongjiang provinces in the northeast and the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region in the north.
</P>
<P>
The funds are mainly used to construct simple granaries, rent
idle buildings for storing grain and expanding and maintaining
existing granaries.
</P>
<P>
Experts note that the funds will help to expand the total
storage capacity by 1.5 billion kilograms of grain.

<HEADLINE> Chittagong Ship Owners Remove Congestion Surcharge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Vessel owners have withdrawn a
punitive congestion surcharge at Bangladesh's largest Chittagong
Port with effect from the first day of this month, port sources
said today.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore-based Chittagong Feeder Trade Committee (CFTC)
has informed port authorities of the decision, saying there was an
improvement and a reduction in congestion at this South Asian
country's key seaport in August.
</P>
<P>
The removal of the surcharge came after repeated appeals of the
port authorities.
</P>
<P>
"Despite economic losses, we will be withdrawing the Chittagong
Port congestion surcharge with retrospective effect from September
1 with vessels departing from Singapore, Colombo and Chittagong."
the committee said in a fax message to port authorities.
</P>
<P>
The feeder operators have imposed congestion surcharge from
time to time since 1992 as a result of shortage of container
handling equipment and space in container yards and unusual
strikes.
</P>
<P>
Chittagong Port witnessed heavy congestion in July mainly due
to a strike by trade unions, incessant rainfall and shortage of
space.
</P>
<P>
The annoyed vessel owners on August 16 imposed the surcharge
for one month with a rate of 150 U.S. dollars for a 20-foot
container and 300 dollars for a 40-foot container per day, as a
cost-recovery measure against overstay of ships at the port.

<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily, China's
leading national newspaper, opened another special column of
special articles to greet forthcoming 15th National Congress of
the Communist Party of China (CPC), the congress. This is the
first in a series of articles entitled the "Great Banner."
</P>
<P>
In an editor's note, the paper noted that the whole party and
the people throughout the country have scored gratifying
achievements over the past 20 years, especially since the 14th
National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) was held
in 1992 under the leadership of the Party Central Committee with
Jiang Zemin at the core.
</P>
<P>
Excerpts of the People's Daily special article "Great
Banner" follow:
</P>
<P>
The CPC 15th National Congress will be convened in a crucial
historical period when the country's reform, opening-up and
socialist modernization drives have inherited the past and are
ushering in the future.
</P>
<P>
The entire world will undoubtedly focus on what banner the
congress will uphold and what road it will follow.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin incisively pointed out in a May 29 speech delivered
at the Party School of the CPC Central Committee that "the banner
refers to the direction in which China will proceed and the image
it will present." Jiang demanded that all Party members, senior
leaders in particular, maintain a high degree of consciousness and
adamancy regarding the issue of banner.
</P>
<P>
The CPC has adhered to Marxism-Leninism guidelines ever since
its founding. "Seventy-six years of arduous revolutionary and
construction causes have enabled the CPC to achieve two
theoretical leaps through a combination of the basic principles of
Marxism-Leninism and specific conditions in China," according to
Hou Shudong, vice-president of the University of National Defense.
</P>
<P>
"In the wake of the first leap, the Party, led by late Chairman
Mao Zedong, produced Mao Zedong Thought, a revolutionary theory
concerning the building of a new China, with the second leap
witnessing the birth of the theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics set forth by the Party with Deng Xiaoping
as its chief representative."
</P>
<P>
Over the past 20 years, China has advanced forward under the
guidance of Deng's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics. The theory has proved to be a successful adoption
of Marxism perfectly fitted to the interim practice of reform in
modern China.

"The essence of the theory on emancipating the mind and seeking
truth from facts can be traced to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong
Thought," according to Yang Chungui, vice-president of the Party
School of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's delivery of the report at the 14th CPC National
Congress continues to reverberate even today. Jiang called for
the Party to unswervingly persevere in improving and accelerating
the reform, opening-up and socialist modernization drives.
</P>
<P>
The Party's adherence to Deng's theory will ensure fulfilment
of the dream for a stable and prosperous China, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
The CPC Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core has
adopted a series of major measures designed to promote the study,
research and publicity of the theory on building socialism with
Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
For example, the third volume of "Selections From Deng
Xiaoping" has been meticulously compiled and published, with the
first and second volumes revised and expanded prior to
publication. A series of symposia on the aforementioned third
volume have been held for principal leading officials at the
provincial and ministerial levels, in addition to three national
symposia covering the subject. A grand documentary on Deng
Xiaoping has been produced and released.
</P>
<P>
The high tide on studying Deng's theory, an activity which
enjoys the active involvement of the populace, is in full swing.

<P>
A full understanding on the part of the general public will
accelerate the momentum of the great theory and promote the
country's material progress.
</P>
<P>
A number of achievements the Party Central Committee with Jiang
Zemin at the core has scored over the past five years as a result
of holding high the banner of Deng Xiaoping's theory on building
socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
For example, since the 14th National Party Congress in 1992,
the Party Central Committee has endorsed the establishment of a
socialist market economy as the ultimate goal of the nation's
economic restructuring, and has carefully designed the basic
framework for the new market economic structure.
</P>
<P>
The central leadership of the CPC has also pointed out the
Party's critical role in solving China's current problems, and has
in turn introduced a series of measures to strengthen efforts to
build the Party.
</P>
<P>
The Party also presented a magnificent blueprint for China's
future development by drafting the Ninth Five-Year Plan
(1996-2000) for National Economic and Social Development and the
Long-Term Targets for the Year 2010, and has at the same time
strengthened efforts to promote the socialist ethical and
cultural progress.
</P>
<P>
The entire Party has the solemn duty to hold high the great
banner of Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with
Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
It called for serious studies of Deng's theory, and
appropriately applying the theory in practice.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the country's reform, opening-up and
modernization drives have entered a critical period urgently
necessitates using Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism
with Chinese characteristics to study new situations and solve new
problems.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jinshan, deputy secretary of the Provincial Party
Committee in east China's Zhejiang Province and deputy to the 15th
national Party congress, is quoted as saying that anyone who
agrees to hold high the banner of Deng's theory must resolutely
safeguard the authority of the Party Central Committee with Jiang
at the core.
</P>
<P>
This represents the fundamental interests of the entire Party
and people from all ethnic groups across the country, and serves
as a critical guarantee for the Party's everlasting unity and
strength, as well as the country's long-term prosperity and
stability, Wang said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Four Kenyans have been killed
in fresh violence hitting Likoni, located in the Indian Ocean
port Mombasa, and southwestern Gucha-Trans Mara districts, local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Three people were killed with at least 12 seriously injured in
recent separate boundary clashes in Gucha-Trans Mara Districts
where youths from the Maasai and Kisii communities engaged in a
fierce fight, said the report.
</P>
<P>
One up-country person was shot dead by armed raiders in Likoni
Thursday. The gunmen also set ablaze an unoccupied wholesale
shop, 300 meters from the burnt down Likoni police station where
six police had been killed on August 13.
</P>
<P>
Likoni residents said the attackers were armed with guns,
bows, arrows and pangas and resembled the raiders who have been
terrorizing the area two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
However, the police in Likoni said the attack was an isolated
case of robbery, denying that it was linked to the wave of terror
at the coast.
</P>
<P>
Another group of raiders, also unidentified, burnt down a
hotel and two residential houses in Likoni Thursday, while
leaving leaflets asking all inland communities to leave.
</P>
<P>
By Thursday, the fourth day of the third term, Likoni schools
remained empty.
</P>
<P>
Violence in the coastal districts in Kenya in the second half
of August claimed at least 46 lives and dealt a serious blow to
the tourism industry with hotels closed and foreigners canceling
booking.
</P>
<P>
Usually at least 5,000 tourists arrive in Mombasa weekly
during this season but now the number has fallen drastically by
between 30 and 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Tourism industry is the number one foreign exchange earner for
the east African country which received 770,000 visitors last
year with an earning of 480 million U.S. Dollars.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Foreign Missions in Financial Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Eleven Ugandan foreign
missions are getting into financial trouble, local media reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Elly Karuhanga, chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on
Presidential Affairs, told the committee's meeting yesterday that
he had received complaints from Ugandan envoys in London, Bonn,
Copenhagen, Geneva, Rome, Ottawa, Washington, Paris, New York,
Havana and Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Martin Aliker, state minister for foreign affairs, confirmed
the difficult financial situation of the concerned missions.
</P>
<P>
In their fax messages to Karuhanga, the envoys complained the
slow response to their financial demands. The missions face
stoppage of supply of water and power due to the arrears, the
messages said.
</P>
<P>
Aliker told the meeting that the Foreign Ministry has no
enough money to divide among foreign missions.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Nabeta, permanent secretary of the Foreign Ministry,
told the meeting that his ministry was reducing the staff number
at the foreign missions. He said 50 percent of the staff is back
to Uganda. Even visiting Ugandan delegations are reduced to save
the fund, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Aliker revealed that the Ugandan Foreign Ministry has a fund
of 100 million Ugandan Shillings (some 100 thousand U.S. Dollars)
for its foreign missions.

<HEADLINE> NPC Urges Earnest Implementation of Water Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Wang Hanbin, one of China's
highest ranking legislators, has called for the earnest
implementation of the Water Law in order to better deal with the
problems of grave water shortages and water pollution.
</P>
<P>
Wang, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC) issued the call prior to the legislature's
fact-finding missions to check law enforcement efforts in
Heilongjiang, Henan and Hunan provinces.
</P>
<P>
Wang acknowledged that the country has scored remarkable
achievements in water conservancy construction and the protection
of water resources since the Water Law went into effect in
1988. Success has also been achieved in combating serious flooding
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
However, Wang pointed out that success has been costly in terms
of financial and human resources, and outdated water conservancy
facilities on major rivers and lakes are inadequate for battling
major flooding.
</P>
<P>
He noted that water shortages and water pollution continue to
impede national economic development and pose a threat to the
health and well-being of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
According to Ministry of Water Resources, the agriculture
sector suffers from an annual water shortage of 30 billion cubic
meters. There is six billion cubic meter shortfall for industrial
production, losing some 200 billion yuan in industrial output
value.
</P>
<P>
This year's droughts in northern and northeast China have
affected over 20 million ha. of crops, with sections in the middle
and lower reaches of the Yellow River remaining dry for 137
consecutive days.
</P>
<P>
Serious pollution levels prevent many cities from using water
from nearby rivers.
</P>
<P>
"Protecting water resources is imperative because of their
direct bearing on sustainable economic development," said Wang.
</P>
<P>
He urged NPC fact-finding groups to closely monitor the
situation, introduce timely solutions to problems, and summarize
experience in the realm of law enforcement.

<HEADLINE> Japan Urges U.S. to Withdraw Shipping Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Transport Minister
Makoto Koga today urged the United States to immediately revoke
sanctions it imposed on Japanese shipping firms.
</P>
<P>
A unilateral system of U.S. fines affecting Japan's three
largest shipping companies went into effect late Thursday to
punish alleged restrictive practices in Japanese ports.
</P>
<P>
Koga was quoted as saying by a Kyodo news agency report that
Japan will swiftly consider what measures it should take.
</P>
<P>
"In consultation with the Foreign Ministry, the Transport
Ministry may have to think about some kind of measures to stop
U.S. sanctions ... which means we may seek negotiations between
the two governments," Koga said.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda issued a
warning in his statement that the sanctions "could have a serious,
adverse impact on Japan-U.S. economic relations."
</P>
<P>
Under the sanctions, Japan's Nippon Yusen K.K., Mitsui O.S.K.
Lines Ltd. and Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd. must pay 100,000 U.S.
dollars each time one of their freighters enters a U.S. port.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were introduced by the U.S. Federal Maritime
Commission as ongoing talks in Tokyo on Japanese port reforms
failed to reach an agreement by the September 4 deadline.
</P>
<P>
The independent commission was complaining about what it
regards as two restrictions on competition.
</P>
<P>
One is Japan's "prior consultation" system in which any changes
in shipping practices must first be discussed with the Japan
Harbor Transportation Association (JHTA).
</P>
<P>
The JHTA represents harbor transport service companies
including port and terminal operators and stevedores.
</P>
<P>
The other is Japanese harbors' alleged discrimination against
U.S. carriers that have attempted to run their own operations in
Japanese ports.

<HEADLINE> PNA Arrests 2 Hamas Leaders, 8 Activists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian police has
arrested two Hamas leaders following Thursday's triple suicide
bombing in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel continued charging that the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) is not doing enough to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that the two political leaders of the
Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) were arrested hours after
the three bombings in central Jerusalem's Ben Yehuda pedestrian
mall.
</P>
<P>
One of the two arrested was identified as Jabal Mansour from
the West Bank city of Nablus, and the other as Mahmad Musalah from
another West Bank city of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the PNA also arrested eight other Hamas activists
and shut down a newspaper published by the militant group, the
radio said.
</P>
<P>
At least seven people, including three suicide bombers, were
killed and nearly 200 others wounded Thursday afternoon in the
powerful blasts claimed by Hamas.
</P>
<P>
Hamas also claimed responsibility for the July 30 twin bombings
in Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market that killed 17 people and
injured 170 others.
</P>
<P>
In his reaction late Thursday, PNA President Yasser Arafat in
Gaza condemned the triple bombing as "terrorist activities" which
were against the Israeli people, the Palestinian people and the
whole peace process.
</P>
<P>
PNA Cabinet Secretary Ahmed Abdel Rahman offered to resume full
security cooperation with Israel, a condition Israel placed on
continuing the peace process. The PNA would do its best to
investigate and apprehend the people behind the bombings, he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel reacted strongly to the triple bombing by reimposing
the total closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, including the
internal travel ban on Palestinians in West Bank, which was just
eased in past few days.
</P>
<P>
To express its anger about what it called Arafat's reluctance
to fight terrorism, Israel refused to allow Arafat's helicopter to
fly from Gaza to Ramallah, where he was scheduled to convene the
weekly Cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's flights between Gaza and West Bank are coordinated
with Israeli security and aviation authorities under interim peace
deals signed since 1993.
</P>
<P>
This was the second time that Arafat's helicopter was grounded
by Israel. The first was last September after fierce
Israeli-Palestinian clashes following Israel's opening of a West
Wall underground tunnel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, during a visit to
the wounded in a Jerusalem hospital Thursday, said that unless
the PNA changed its attitude toward the terrorist organizations,
the peace process would not continue.
</P>
<P>
He blasted Arafat for appeasing terrorists by "hugging and
embracing" senior political leaders of Hamas and the Islamic Jihad
during a recent meeting under the banner of "national unity."
</P>
<P>
He also attacked Palestinian security chief in West Bank Jibril
Rajoub for taking the same path by telling militant leaders that
they were brothers "in the same struggle."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu convened an emergency meeting with senior security
officials following the bombings to assess the situation. He is
also to reconvene the security meeting today to formulate further
moves against the PNA to step up pressure on fighting
terrorism.

<HEADLINE> Continued Efforts Pledged for Burundi Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Great
Lakes region have pledged continued efforts to solve the
conflicts in the central African country of Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The stand of the leaders was made public in a communique
issued last night in Dar es Salaam at the end of a summit of the
region, which is available today.
</P>
<P>
The regional leaders maintained that the Burundi crisis should
be solved through negotiation whose objective is to achieve a new
fraternity in the country based on the principles of democracy
and security for all.
</P>
<P>
The summit rejected an offer by Burundi mediator, former
Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere, to resign as demanded by
Burundi. And the next round of talks on the Burundi peace process
will be held in Arusha, northern Tanzania, later.
</P>
<P>
"The summit urged all the parties, including the Burundi
government to take part in those talks, which will be convened by
the facilitator, Mwalimu Julius Nyerere," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The summit called on the Burundi military administration to
halt the on-going trials, saying no trials should be held until a
negotiated solution is reached on how to deal with politically
motivated crimes in the country, including massacres committed
since 1993 specially.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the region also called for an unconditional release
of some detained politicians in Burundi so as to let them travel
freely and participate in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"Existing sanctions will be maintained. A special secretariat
will be set up to monitor the effectiveness of the sanctions,"
said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Leaders or their representatives from the Congo (K), Rwanda,
Uganda, Ethiopia, Zambia, Tanzania, Kenya, Zimbabwe, and OAU
Secretary General Salim A Salim took part in the regional summit.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi had stayed away from the
meeting in anger at countries he accuses of demanding tough
measures which they then fail to enforce. Regional experts say
that without Kenya's presence such decisions are unlikely and
would be meaningless if the most important economy in the region
was not actively involved.
</P>
<P>
Situation in Burundi has been worsened since june 1996 when
Major Pierre Buyoya's military regime took over power from a
civilian government in that central African country.

JERUSALEM, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Finance Ministry
has decided to cut 2.3 billion Shekel (about 657 million U.S.
dollars) in the budget for 1998, the Jerusalem Post newspaper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
This plan includes cuts of budget for each ministry, except
that of health, David Milgrom, head of the Finance Ministry's
budget department, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The cuts are "a continuation of our message that the government
should make itself smaller and that the business sectors should
flourish," he explained.
</P>
<P>
He said public health care institutions would be allowed to
raise fees, while child subsidies for middle and high income
families would be reduced.
</P>
<P>
The plan is to be presented to the Cabinet on Sunday, according
to the report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Finance Minister Yaacov Neeman promised not
to raise taxes.
</P>
<P>
"The tax burden on the people is negative and hurts growth (of
the economy). Our goal is to promote growth," he said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Economy on Healthy Track: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- All the internationally
recognized indicators show that the economy of Bangladesh is on a
sound and healthy track and its prospects are bright, Bangladesh
Finance Minister Shah A. M. S. Kibria said recently.
</P>
<P>
The banking system has sanctioned industrial credit amounting
to 79.32 billion taka (about 18.03 billion U.S. dollars) and
disbursed 78.18 billion taka (about 17.77 billion dollars) in the
last fiscal year (1996-97), the minister said in an interview with
the local press.
</P>
<P>
The statement by the finance minister was aimed at rejecting
his predecessor's claim that the country's economy "may collapse
in two months if right steps are not taken," the local newspaper
Daily Star reported today.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that the working capital disbursed during
the last fiscal year was 66.6 billion taka (about 15.14 billion
dollars), which was about double the amount for the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the foreign investment situation, the minister said
foreign investors proposed to invest 1.054 billion dollars in the
1996-97 fiscal year (starting from July 1) while 17 projects
involving 53.53 million dollars were set up in the export
processing zones.
</P>
<P>
In the power sector, he stated that agreements have already
been signed to invest 400 million dollars while three more
contracts are going to be signed shortly for an investment of 700
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
An amount of 100 million dollars has already been invested in
the gas sector and an additional 270 million dollars will be put
in within a year or two, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
In the telecommunications sector, he said, a total of 175
million dollars has already been invested and the investment of
another 500 million dollars is expected to be made within next
three years.
</P>
<P>
The minister expressed satisfaction over the macroeconomic
situation and said the country's foreign exchange reserves now
stand at 1.713 billion dollars as against 1.6 billion dollars in
August.
</P>
<P>
"The overall picture of foreign investment is certainly bright
and the prophets of doom, who are lamenting the situation, are
going to be proved wrong," he stressed.

STOCKHOLM, September 5 (Xinhua) -- A suspect bomber carrying an
explosive device was arrested near a statue used as the logo for
Stockholm's 2004 Olympic bid, local police said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Anders Frantz'n said policemen who were
monitering activities around at Milles sculpture garden made the

<P>
The arrest came after eight arson attacks at various sports
venues around Stockholm this year and two bomb explosions at

</P>
<P>
A secret group called We Who Built Sweden claimed
responsibility for the bombs and threatened more action, saying
money should not be spent to host an Olympics but on social causes.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Registers Low Inflation Rate in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines registered an
annual inflation rate of 4.5 percent in August, lower than the 4.8
percent posted in June and July, despite the peso's depreciation,
the National Statistic Office said today.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine peso depreciated from 26.1 to the U.S. dollar in
early July to 32.4 Thursday, but the inflation rate remained
surprisingly low for August.
</P>
<P>
The consumer price index was estimated at 241.1 in August, from
239.3 in July, the office said in a report released here.
</P>
<P>
On a year-on-year basis, it said, housing and repair recorded a
higher rate of 9.7 percent in the month from 9.4 percent in July,
while fuel and water increased by 8.9 percent, compared with 7.5
percent in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate for food alone slowed down to 0.6 percent in

</P>
<P>
But on a month-on-month basis, prices edged up by 0.8 percent
in August from 0.1 percent in July, it said.
</P>
<P>
"The biggest influence on month-on-month inflation for August
1997 can be attributed to food, beverages and tobacco and fuel,
light and water," the office said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Achieve Cotton Output Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is expected to
achieve its target of 10 million bales of cotton this year, each
weighing 170 kilograms despite recent floods and torrential rains,
the Pakistan Central Cotton Committee officials said.
</P>
<P>
Cotton sowing in central Punjab province and southern Sindh
province had exceeded the target of 2.9 million hectares,
registering a 3 percent increase over last year, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The recent flooding in Punjab had "minutely affected" the
cotton crop while the rains so far had a better impact on the
crop, they said.
</P>
<P>
Punjab is expected to produce 8.4 million bales of cotton while
Sindh is likely to harvest about 1.6 million bales, they said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is one of the largest cotton producers in the world.
Exports of cotton and its products contributed more than 60
percent of the country's total exports of around 8.7 billion U.S.
dollars during the fiscal year from July 1995 to June 1996.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan produced 8.78 million bales of cotton last year
against the target of 10 million. The shortfall was blamed on pest
attack, lack of rain and use of substandard seeds by some key
cultivators.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thailand Holds Charter Draft Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh has called on the Constitution Drafting Assembly
(CDA) to cooperate with parliament to amend the constitution
draft.
</P>
<P>
During a joint house debate on the draft in parliament on
Thursday, he asked that, if the CDA admits that there are flaws in
the draft, whether it is possible for the points in dispute to be
amended with full support from the CDA, before the draft is put to
vote later this month.
</P>
<P>
The 99-member CDA, elected last December in nationwide
elections, was given 240 days to draft a charter, with the aim of
getting rid of money politics and political corruption in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The draft was completed in August ahead of its deadline and was
then submitted to parliament (the National Assembly) for approval
or disapproval.
</P>
<P>
According to regulations, the National Assembly can vote either
in favor of it or reject it. If it is rejected, it would go for
national referendum.
</P>
<P>
However, Chavalit's proposal received little support from MPs.
</P>
<P>
Anand Panyarachun, chairman of the Charter Drafting Committee
of the CDA, said the CDA had completed its work and it is now for
parliament to decide by itself what it would do to the draft. The
CDA will not take any part in its amendment.
</P>
<P>
Opposition leader Chuan Leekpai said the prime minister's move
was unconstitutional. Banharn Silpa-Archa, leader of the Chart
Thai Party, also in the opposition, said that any amendment to the
draft could only be done after its passage.
</P>
<P>
The charter draft, although with some clauses unacceptable to
some politicians and MPs, is generally welcomed by the public, in
particular students organizations, as a major step forward to
clean Thailand's political corruption.
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 supporters of the draft demonstrated in front of
parliament on Thursday, the first day of the debate on the draft.
</P>
<P>
Another group, estimated at 15,000, among them grassroots
leaders, such as district and village heads, are expected to hold
a rally at the Parliament House today, to show their opposition to
the draft.
</P>
<P>
Fears have been mounting for weeks over the possibility of
violence between supporters and opponents of the charter draft.
</P>
<P>
Some political organizations have urged that parliament adopt
the draft in its entirety and make amendments wherever necessary
later on.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the debate focused on article 3, which states that
sovereign power "belongs to" the people, while the present
constitution holds that it "emanates from" the people.
</P>
<P>
It was argued that the new version could diminish the power of
the constitutional monarchy. One senator said if the power
"belongs to" the people, they can take it back from the monarchy
at will.
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the draft charter also identified technical errors
during the debate, a move allegedly trying to block the draft's
passage through parliament.

NEW DELHI, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Inder
Kumar Gujral has called upon the government enforcement agencies
to take note of the prevailing public mood against corruption and
work expeditiously to eradicate it, the local press said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of the country's anti-corruption and
vigilance wings working at different levels, Gujral urged officers
of the enforcement agencies to revise the entire methodology of
investigation to cut delays and make the vigilance and
anti-corruption wings more result-oriented.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the anti-corruption cell which was recently set up
in the prime minister's office, Gujral said that the people were
approaching this office in the last resort because the normal
machinery did not appear to be making impact.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister urged the anti-corruption and vigilance
agencies to cut through the problems to restore the faith of the
people in the system.

<HEADLINE> Mid-Air Collision Averted in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 5 (Xinhua) -- A mid-air collision between
an Indian Boeing 737 airliner and an Indian air force jet was
averted on Thursday due to the swift action taken by one of the
pilots, the Hindustan Times said today.
</P>
<P>
According to informed sources, the Boeing 737 coming from the
Indian-held Jammu on a scheduled flight with 100 passengers would
have collided with the air force jet if the latter's pilot had not
taken evasive action.
</P>
<P>
The two planes had a very narrow escape, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing aircraft of the Alliance Air, a subsidiary of the
Indian airlines, was cruising in the air about 80 kilometers from
Delhi.
</P>
<P>
It was under Delhi control at the level of 2,900 feet when the
air force jet came from the left in the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
The Alliance Air pilot, the sources said, could not see the
plane coming from the opposite direction due to bad weather.
</P>
<P>
However, the air force pilot took quick action and turned his
plane to the left side wing of the Boeing 737 in just a couple of
seconds, thus averting a major tragedy.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the impact of the air force plane, as it
passed by, was felt by the passengers of the Boeing 737 jet.

BELGRADE, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic said here today that the NATO-Led Multinational
Stabilization Force (SFOR) should solve problems politically
rather than by threatening use of force during their mission.

</P>
<P>
Milosevic and Clark exchanged views on the implementation of

Milosevic said that Serb authorities have been engaging in
constructive cooperation with SFOR and the recent political crisis
among the Serb leadership shouldn't affect the cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Clark said that he and Milosevic also discussed the importance
of the Serb army maintaining neutrality during the Bosnian Serb
political crisis and of getting along with the SFOR.
</P>
<P>
Members of the SFOR have the right to defend themselves when
their lives are threatened, Clark said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Japanese Firms See Big Loss As Baht Floats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Japanese firms operating in
Thailand have suffered huge losses in foreign exchange as the baht
depreciated sharply over the past two months.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,000 Japanese companies operating in Thailand have lost a
total of 1,000 billion yen (about 8.3 billion U.S. dollars) since
the baht floated on July 2, a senior official of the Japanese
External Trade Organization (JETRO) said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two months, the currency instability has
seriously affected businesses as operators had no choice but to
adopt wait-and-see attitude before the baht is stabilized, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers today reported that the losses that Japanese
firms in Thailand suffered varied depending on their import needs.
</P>
<P>
Japanese automobile companies in Thailand, which imported more
than 50 percent of their materials, have been among the hardest
hit, while electronics and electrical appliance manufacturers
suffered less because they applied more local materials.
</P>
<P>
Companies which sold more locally than abroad are in worse
shape than those which sold more abroad.
</P>
<P>
Despite the losses, Japan will continue to roll over foreign
exchange loans given to companies in Thailand, Hayashi said.
</P>
<P>
Loans from Japanese financial institutions reportedly accounted
for about half of the total 72 billion dollar foreign currency
debts borrowed by the private sector in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's total foreign currency debts currently stand at
around 90 billion dollars and 37 billion of the total is in
short-term loans which will mature over the next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
However, Hayashi said, more conditions will be attached to the
rolled-over loans in a bid to protect the lenders.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed hopes that the Thai government would address
its political problems to help ease the currency instability.
</P>
<P>
The baht so far has plunged by about 47 percent since July 2,
due to the strong dollar and the pending censure debate to be
launched by the opposition next Monday against Prime Minister
Chavalit Yongchaiyudh. The Thai central bank Thursday quoted its
reference rate above 38 baht against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The current Southeast Asian currency crisis has hit Japanese
firms in Thailand harder than elsewhere in the region as Japan has
the largest amount of investment in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Expecting the Thai economy will recover within the next two
years, Hayashi said that the immediate outlook remain uncertain.

<P>
BEIJING, September 5 -- Beijing streets are taking on a new
look as the city has started a large-scale street renovation

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Export of Leather Products Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's export of leather
and leather products has drastically declined during the month of
July due to high production costs and lack of proper adjustment
between the Pakistani rupees and a number of foreign currencies.
</P>
<P>
According to sources with the Pakistan Tanners Association, in
July, leather export had declined by 21.52 percent while that of
leather products by 25.16 as compared to the corresponding month
of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Major European currencies have adjusted downwards by 13 to 18
percent against the U.S. dollar during the last four months.
However, there has been no adjustment in the Pakistani rupee
during this period, which has resulted in high production costs
and decline in exports, the sources said.

</P>
<P>
Soeharto also called for improvement in trade relations between
Bangladesh and Indonesia. "There is still a lot of potential for
further development together, especially in the fields of
agriculture and technical cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have similarities, where the majority of our people are
Muslims, and our nations are working to improve our welfare,"
Soeharto said.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto further expressed the hope that the second D-8 (eight
developing countries belonging to the Organization of the Islamic
Conference) summit be held in Dhaka next year can result in
concrete efforts to improve its member countries' welfare.

<HEADLINE> Russia Condemns Terrorist Attack in Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Russia condemned suicide bomb
explosions in downtown West Jerusalem Thursday that injured 165
persons and killed seven people, including three suspected Hamas
bombers.
</P>
<P>
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Viktor Posuvalyuk said tonight
in a statement that the bombings had put the Mideast peace process
in jeopardy. However, Russia hoped the process would not be too
deeply affected, he added.
</P>
<P>
The terrorist attack was apparently aimed at blocking the peace
process and Russia is seriously concerned over it, Posuvalyuk said.
</P>
<P>
The new explosions prompted the Israeli government to reimpose
the total closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which had been
partially eased during the past weeks.
</P>
<P>
Previous explosions in Jerusalem on July 30 killed 17 people
and injured 170 others. The attack also devastated the peace
process, which had been stalled since Israel broke ground to build
a controversial Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem in March.

<HEADLINE> China Still Having Chances to Reap Autumn Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- It is still too early to
predict a decline in China's grain harvest for this autumn, in
spite of a severe drought, a Ministry of Agriculture official
said.
</P>
<P>
If predicted weather conditions prevail, the situation
regarding grain crops is expected to improve, and there is still
time for rice crops to recover in south China, the China Daily
quoted Zhao Hanjie as saying today.
</P>
<P>
Since July, vast areas of northern China and the middle and
lower reaches of the Yangtze River have been hit by drought. By
the end of August, 9.3 million ha of crops were still suffering
from drought, nearly half of which were said to be in serious
danger.
</P>
<P>
"Drought in north China this summer has caused severe damage to
grain crops, especially maize, in some places," Zhao said. In its
key growth period, some maize did not even bear fruit.
</P>
<P>
But in most provinces, weather forecasts show that the first
frost will come at the normal time or later. Generally, the
earliest frost does not hit China until after September 20, Zhao
said.
</P>
<P>
It is too soon to say whether there will be an overall
reduction in the grain harvest this year, as there was an increase
of 10.7 million tons of grain in the summer harvest, he said.
</P>
<P>
To safeguard the harvest, field management is expected to be
strengthened. Measures will include increased irrigation of dry
areas.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, meteorologists predicted that the drought will
continue through the first 10 days of September in spite of
increased rainfall in some areas of northeast and south China.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Airline May Suffer Heavy Loss This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan International
Airlines Corporation (PIA) is likely to suffer heavy financial
loss in the 1997-98 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the airline anticipated that the financial loss of
the national flag carrier may rise to around 3.5 billion rupee
(about 87 million U.S. dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
The present management, which had inherited around 6.25 billion
rupee (about 156 million dollars) of overdraft, had added up
another 2.25 billion rupee (about 56 million dollars) in the
ongoing financial crisis at the airline, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The total PIA earnings during the last financial year were
around 22.9 billion rupee (about 570 million dollars), the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned PIA which was graded as top ten among the world
airlines in the 1970s is now ranked 41st among about 240 carriers
of the world.
</P>
<P>
Plagued with financial problems, over-staffing and decreasing
quality of services, the airline profitability has registered a
decline in the past several years.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Banks Quit Thailand's Fund Recycling Schemes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Foreign banks have quitted
deposits recycling schemes brokered by the Bank of Thailand which
are designed to help create a clearing balance among the banks in
the country, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
However, Bank of Thailand governor Chaiyawat Wibulswasdi said
that his bank will proceed with the scheme together with local
commercial banks, but without the participation of foreign banks,
according to The Nation.
</P>
<P>
The Thai central bank early last month announced to carry out a
liquidity fund scheme and a deposit insurance fund scheme, which
require banks seeing rising deposits to transfer part of their
funds to those banks experiencing deposit runs.
</P>
<P>
Some banks, especially foreign banks, said that they will not
participate in the schemes as the Thai central bank does not want
to provide guarantees for loans made through the schemes, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Some banks also said that lending through the schemes may cause
the proportion of loans extended to a bank to exceed the lending
limit, which is 25 percent of the lender's capital, according to
the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they stressed that they have to put aside their
excess liquidity to increase their reserves.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said that the schemes are impractical,
particularly as lenders will be concerned about the risk of
others.

BANGKOK, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Despite oversupply, about
621,000 square meters of new office space is expected to come on
the market in Bangkok by the end of this year, according to a real
estate consultant.
</P>
<P>
Of the new supply, about 297,000 square meters, or 48 percent,
is located in the central business district, studies of real
estate consultant Jones Lang Wootton (Thailand) show.
</P>
<P>
However, demand for office space declined this year,
particularly from the cash-strapped financial sector which was hit
by a currency crisis recently. At the end of June, the average
vacancy rate in the central business district stood at 13.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
Real estate oversupply has lasted for about four years, leaving
the banking and finance sectors being ridden with a huge amount of
non-performing loans or bad debt.

<HEADLINE> Official: Outside Assistance Facilitates Tibet's Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- A senior Tibetan official said
that rapid economic and social development in Tibet is the result
of constant assistance from the central government and inland
provinces and regions, including aid in terms of human resources.
</P>
<P>
Qaicham Norbu, Chairman of the Tibetan Autonomous Regional
People's Government, called officials from other parts of China
who have helped with the local economy "the fresh blood" of the
region's development.
</P>
<P>
"They are sent not in a way of a systematic migration as
described by some hostile foreign forces," the chairman pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
He told vice governor of Jiangsu Province Ji Yunshi who visited
the region recently that the selfless aid from inland provinces
and regions, including Jiangsu, has contributed to Tibet's rapid
social and economic development and "Tibet is now experiencing the
best period in history."
</P>
<P>
Ji was on an inspection tour last week to Tibet, where the east
China province has invested around 200 million yuan (about 25
million US dollars) over the past two years to help build
hospitals, schools, training centers as well as a Tibetan
pharmaceutical factory.
</P>
<P>
Accompanying Ji were officials from provincial economic
departments who were to offer suggestions for Tibet's development
as well as concrete cooperation projects.
</P>
<P>
"We were not sure at first whether our investment in Tibet
would be practical and welcome," said the visiting vice
governor. "Now we are convinced that our projects have yielded
positive results."
</P>
<P>
Ji promised another 10 million yuan to help finance the
construction of a hospital for women and children and the
renovation of a main street in Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu is among 14 provinces and cities entrusted by the
central government to render assistance to Tibet.
</P>
<P>
"It is obvious that Tibet's development cannot be achieved
without their assistance," Qaicham Norbu said, adding that Tibet
achieved a GDP valued at 6.5 billion yuan last year, with a growth
rate outpacing the nation's average for the first time. The per
capita income in Tibet last year exceeded 900 yuan.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Tibet needs the support of the whole country and
Tibetan people hope to build a better Tibet with people from other
ethnic nationalities.
</P>
<P>
"It is the fundamental aspiration of Tibetan people and cannot
be shaken by any rumors and irresponsible remarks," Qaicham Norbu
stressed.

<HEADLINE> Samaranch Re-elected as IOC President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAUSANNE, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The 77-year-old Juan Antonio
Samaranch was re-elected by a unanimous vote Thursday as president
of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for a fourth term
until year of 2001.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch first took the spot in 1980 and was originally due to
retire this year under IOC rules preventing members standing for
office after the age of 75.
</P>
<P>
But he was able to stay in power after his Latin allies forced
a vote to raise the IOC age limit in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch has played a huge role in turning the Olympic
movement into a successful commercial enterprise and earlier this
year signed a television deal for more than two billion
U.S. dollars with the American network NBC for the 2004 and 2008
Summer Games and 2006 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch has already said that this will be his last period in
office and that the 2000 Sydney Summer Olympics will mark his last
Games in charge.
</P>
<P>
He has also said that he would not hesitate to step down at any
time if he felt he was not fit enough to continue in office.
</P>
<P>
The IOC session also elected American Anita Defrantz as its
first woman vice-president.

<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- China has led the world with
average annual economic growth of 12 percent over the past five
years, some 8.6 percentage points higher than the world average.
</P>
<P>
China continues to maintain a rapid economic growth which is
expected to hit 10 percent for 1997, according to a recent report
released by the State Statistical Bureau.
</P>
<P>
China has jumped to 7th place in the world now from 10th place
in 1990 in terms of GDP, with the nation becoming one of the major
driving forces fueling the economic recovery throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, the central government has adopted a moderately
tight macroeconomic control policy designed to balance reform,
development and stability, while at the same time cooling the
overheated economy and reducing double-digit inflation.
</P>
<P>
As a consequence, China has successfully fulfilled its targets
for an economic "soft landing" and has managed to record continued
stable economic performance.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 20 years, China has made marked advances in
promoting its overall national strength and established close
links with the world economy.
</P>
<P>
China, home to world's largest population, continues to play an
increasingly important role in worldwide economic development. In
addition, China holds an important position in the world trade,
capital, and tourist markets.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign trade volume reached 289.9 billion US dollars
in 1996, ranking 11th in the world, with export volume reaching
151.1 billion US dollars. China expects to maintain a growing GDP,
and has vast potential for developing imports and exports.

The nation's foreign currency reserves of more than 120 billion
US dollars, the second largest in the world, will also guarantee
more foreign trade business.
</P>
<P>
China has led developing countries in the use of long-term
overseas capital since the 1990s, and is currently the world's
second largest user of foreign funds following the United States.
</P>
<P>
Recent estimates indicate that well over half the world's top
500 multinational corporations have listed China as their first
choice for investment.
</P>
<P>
China has rapidly increased personnel exchanges with countries
throughout the world. Last year alone, China hosted more than 51
million overseas visitors, or 8.6 percent of the worldwide total,
ranking second only to France. The nation's tourism earnings for
the year hit 12 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The growing output of China's major agricultural and industrial
products have contributed greatly to a stable world market. In
1996, China ranked first in the world in producing cereals,
cotton, rapeseed, meat, steel, coal, textiles, cement, and TV
sets, and second in power output and chemical fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
The fact that China feeds the 22 percent of global population
on only seven percent of the total farmland readily exhibits that
China is a major contributor to the world economy, according to
the report.

<HEADLINE> Township Enterprises in China Absorb Half of Surplus Rural Laborers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 5 (Xinhua) -- By the end of 1996, China's
23 million township enterprises had employed 135 million people,
about half of the surplus labor force in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
Township industries have played a big role in the country's
industrialization and economic development as a whole.
</P>
<P>
This conclusion was made by participants at a recent
international seminar on a comparative study of township
enterprises in China and small and medium-sized firms in
Japan. The meeting was held in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The countryside in China has a dense population and limited
cultivated land. In the early 1990s, the country's surplus rural
labor force reached 250 million, while the farmland per capita was
less than 0.093 ha.
</P>
<P>
The booming rural industries have provided a way out for the
country's excess rural workers. Between 1978-1988, the number of
laborers hired by township enterprises went up by 6.72 million
annually. In 1989, the figure topped 93.66 million, which
accounted for 22 percent of the village workforce in China.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the number of workers in township enterprises, which
stood at 112 million, surpassed that of state-owned enterprises
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Township industries account for one third of farmers'
income. The payroll of the workers in township firms came to 534
billion yuan (65 billion US dollars) in 1996, and the annual
average wage was 4,195 yuan (511 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Seminar participants spoke highly of the development of rural
industries since the country adopted the reform and opening policy
in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Xie Baisan from Fudan University observed that an
ever-growing army of industrial workers has emerged in the
countryside, which has profound implications for China. The state
would have to pay over three trillion yuan to employ these surplus
laborers, but the cost is 200 billion yuan when they are hired by
rural enterprises, the professor noted.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the state has not had to earmark funds to arrange
employment for the surplus rural workforce, thanks to the
township and village-based factories.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Argentina will build a
gigantic fertilizer-manufacturing plant capable of producing more
than one million tons of fertilizers a year.
</P>
<P>
This plant will give added value to Argentine Natural Gas,

It noted that the plant will manufacture more than one million
tons a year of urea and 80,000 tons of ammonia, thus becoming the
biggest of its kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
The investment for this project is approximately 600 million
dollars and it is foreseen that the construction will start at the
end of this year. The plant will be put into operation in 2000,
according to the press release.
</P>
<P>
According to an official document on environmental approval and

CAIRO, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Host Egypt defeated Asia's
second-ranked team Thailand 3-2 in the opening match of the 7th
Under-17 world championship here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, ranked first in Africa, staged a number of strong
charges but tied with Thailand 1-1 in the first half.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian striker Ahmed Belal scored twice, in the 15th minute
of the first half and less than 60 seconds into the second half,
driving the 100,000 home fans in the Cairo Stadium into ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
Within 18 minutes, Arabi Mahmoud slipped a third ball into the
net, enabling his team to prevail over Thailand 3-1.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's Suksomkit Sutee made a beautiful quick revenge three
minutes later to pull the score to 2-3.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, the debutant at the championship, played a close game
with Egypt. It could have drawn the match if a blast in the last

</P>
<P>
Chile and Germany will play here Friday in the second match of
Group A.
</P>
<P>
Group D goes into action on Friday, when defending champion
Ghana meets Argentina and Cost Rica tackles Bahrain in Port Said.

</P>
<P>
Participating in this international event are 16 teams from
five continents. An unprecedented 80 teams had competed for one of
these 16 slots in the earlier qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
Egypt won the right to host the event last May, beating the
competitor New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
It is also the first time that this tournament takes place in
Africa since its inauguration in Beijing, China, in 1985.
</P>
<P>
FIFA President Joao Havelange said at the opening ceremony
Thursday that Africa is making an ever stronger performance in

</P>
<P>
Earlier, he also predicted that given the Egyptian team's

Colombian drug traffickers in a jail here have planned an escape
during the coming inauguration of the Canal Universal Congress,
police said today.
</P>
<P>
The international congress to be held on September 7-10 would
serve as the distraction for a jailbreak, according to the plan
made by Colombian drug cartels and jail police officials.
</P>
<P>
Authorities discovered the plan after a patient investigation
that led to the capture of two lieutenants and a sub-lieutenant
suspected to be involved in the abortive flight.
</P>
<P>
The drug traffickers and the notorious criminal Jose Maria
Infanson paid the jail officers 200,000 U.S. dollars in cash for
facilitating their flee.
</P>
<P>
The criminals planned to escape the prison when the security
agencies concentrate themselves on the conference after the
arrival of high-ranking foreign dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
Besides providing the 200,000 dollars, Colombian drug cartels
had also rented vehicles and a speedboat for taking the escapees
to Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The police officers involved in the escape plan face sentences
of three to five years in prison. Endiem

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- An international aid program
is helping save the lives of women and children in central China's
Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, the United Nations Children's Fund and Fund for
Population Activities have granted 650,000 US dollars and medical
equipment to update hospitals for women and children in 16
counties in the landlocked province of Hunan, one of the country's
major grain growing bases.
</P>
<P>
Medical care for women and children has reduced the mortality
of lying-in women, infants and children under age of five by one
third.
</P>
<P>
In 1986, 40 out of every 1,000 infants died at birth, with the
mortality rate for pregnant or lying-in women standing at
95 per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
The province's well-equipped health care net for women and
children is staffed by competent professionals. Some 80 percent of
clinics and hospitals at the township level feature maternity
wards and have the capacity to provide emergency care for pregnant
women and infants.

aid program," he told the Senate Foreign Relations panel.
</P>
<P>
Japan, Cambodia's largest donor, in effect suspended aid by
recalling its aid workers after Hun Sen ousted First Prime
Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh early in July.
</P>
<P>
Roth said he would push "very hard" during his Tokyo stop on
September 12 and 13 to prevent the return of aid workers other
than those involved in the humanitarian projects of
non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
Roth said he will also travel to the Philippines and Indonesia,
which he said might influence Cambodia through the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations.
</P>
<P>
He told the Senate panel the Clinton administration continues
to count on the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to lead
negotiations to resolve the Cambodia crisis.
</P>
<P>
Roth said the United States is continuing to suspend some 60
million dollars in assistance other than humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
Roth will leave Washington Friday and will stop in the
Philippines, South Korea and Japan before returning home on
September 14.
</P>
<P>
Roth's nomination as assistant secretary of state for East
Asian and Pacific affairs was approved a month ago by the Senate.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Voting on Compulsory Retirement Savings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Post office staff began to
distribute referendum packs throughout New Zealand today, kicking
off a 20-day national referendum on the compulsory retirement
savings scheme (RSS).
</P>
<P>
NZ Post said 2.5 million packs will be sent to households in
NZ's first postal referendum on RSS at a cost of 5.1 million NZ
dollars (3.15 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The RSS, the brainchild of Deputy Prime Minister Winston
Peters, has attracted attention from the public. The office
overseeing the referendum said a few days ago that over 93
percent of the eligible voters had registered with it and that the
percentage was even higher than that in the last general
election.
</P>
<P>
Presenting his scheme in July, Winston Peters maintained that
the present universal superannuation is not sustainable with the
growing population of old people. He estimated that the
superannuation, now costing NZ the equivalent of 5 percent of
gross domestic product, will rise to almost 12 percent by 2059.
</P>
<P>
He argued that the government will need to raise either tax
rates or the age of entitlement, or reduce the amount of pension
to pay superannuation.
</P>
<P>
Under his scheme, all people earning over 5,000 NZ dollars
(3,150 US dollars) a year must pay a percentage of their income
into a private sector retirement fund.
</P>
<P>
The target of their savings is 120,000 NZ dollars if people
start saving from the age of 25. Once they reach 65, they will use
the money to buy an annuity. But those are not able to save up to
the target will get a top-up from the government.
</P>
<P>
In the past two months since the RSS was put up, Television NZ
has run a series of programs to answer questions concerning the
scheme.
</P>
<P>
But the scheme has met strong opposition from many social
sectors, particularly from poor people. The opposition said the
poor people will fare even worse if they set aside a certain
amount of money for RSS.
</P>
<P>
While the rich think it unnecessary for them to save. They feel
uneasy to put the money into private fund while they cannot touch
the money before they reach 65.
</P>
<P>
Even in the parliament, a recent survey showed that two thirds
of the MPs were against the RSS. Opposing MPs believe that NZ has
the basis of sound retirement provision in the current
superannuation scheme.
</P>
<P>
But supporters of the scheme warn of the increasing pressures
an aging population will exert on the economy over the next 40
years, and point to the fillip which the economy will get from
compulsory savings.
</P>
<P>
Whatever their opinion, people must cast their vote before
September 26, and the final results are expected to be announced
on October 1.

CANBERRA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

</P>
<P>
The Australian
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister John Howard Thursday made his government's
refusal to give Aborigines power over resource developments on
pastoral leases, the central issue in the final political native
title rules. Aboriginal groups declared they would wage a protest
campaign against the government's legislation.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>
-- Up to 300,000 people are facing severe food shortages and
possibly starvation due to drought and frosts caused by the El
Nino weather pattern in Papua New Guinea's Central Highlands.
</P>
<P>
The Age
</P>
<P>
-- The Australian council of Trade Unions may abandon its bid
for a safety-net pay rise for Australia's low-paid workers, and
instead push for a 20 Australian dollars (15 US dollars) increase
in minimum rates of pay.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review
</P>
<P>
-- Consumers are slowly returning to Australia's department
stores and shopping malls, with new figures showing retail sales
grew by a strong 2.6 percent in July, and retail trade in the June
quarter was also stronger than earlier thought.

<HEADLINE> Free Trade Fails to Make Canadian Economy More Efficient </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Free trade has failed to make
Canadian manufacturers more efficient, according to a report by a
Canadian investment firm.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian factories have remained competitive with U.S.
factories only because the Canadian dollar has weakened
substantially since 1991.
</P>
<P>
Productivity levels in Canadian factories were only 80 percent
of those in U.S. factories last year, compared with 95 percent in
1994 and 87 percent in 1988.
</P>
<P>
"Such performance runs counter to the very raison d'etre for
free trade," said the report, which was prepared by CIBC Woody
Gundy Securities Inc. and was published today.
</P>
<P>
"Unfettered access to huge American markets was supposed to
wipe out Canada's productivity disadvantage by allowing Canadian
producers to achieve scale economies otherwise unobtainable in a
small and fragmented domestic market," it said.
</P>
<P>
It should also have pressured manufacturers to become more
efficient so they could compete not only for U.S. customers, but
also against U.S. competitors here at home.
</P>
<P>
Yet, it said, "the competitive pressures that the loss of trade
protection would have normally brought have been blunted and in
most cases actually reversed by the Canadian dollar's
depreciation."
</P>
<P>
Only three industries, namely leather, furniture and clothing,
have been exposed to tariff cuts under free trade that exceeded
the 12 percent depreciation in the Canadian dollar against the
U.S. currency during the past eight years.
</P>
<P>
"The other 12 manufacturing sectors are effectively more
protected today than they were before the free trade, with tariff
cuts swamped by the impact of a depreciating exchange rate," the
report noted.

<HEADLINE> US to Attack Canada in New Dairy War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States is set to
attack Canada's dairy industry again as Canadian dairy farmers
find new buyers for their products abroad, said a report today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is setting the stage for a complaint to the World
Trade Organization about Canada's new two-tiered milk pricing
system, the Financial Post newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The two-year-old pricing system allows Canadian food producers
to buy milk more cheaply if their products are exported.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Canada exported 243 million U.S. dollars' worth of dry
milk powder, butter and cheese to 80 countries.
</P>
<P>
Since the system came into place, Canada's trade balance in
dairy products has gone from a deficit of 8.6 million dollars to a
surplus of 36.5 million dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. National Milk Producers Federation is complaining that
Canada is replacing export subsidies, soon to become illegal, with
"carefully camouflaged subsidies."
</P>
<P>
The federation was reported to be preparing a detailed report
on the Canadian pricing system that will be the basis of a formal
complaint to the WTO later this year.
</P>
<P>
U.S. trade negotiators looked into more details about the
system here recently.
</P>
<P>
Canada dismissed the U.S. complaints about the pricing system,
saying the system is allowed under international trade rules.

<HEADLINE> One in Four Americans Poorly Manage Debts: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 4 (Xinhua) -- At a time when consumer
spending is at its all-time-high, one in four Americans believes
they have debt management problems, according to a national
survey.
</P>
<P>
However, the same study revealed that 91 percent of Americans
believe they are good money managers -- grading themselves a "C"
or better on their ability to manage their finances.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by Omnibus Consumer Survey by the
Opinion Research Corporation International.
</P>
<P>
"When counseling thousands of consumers in financial distress
each week, we have found that most don't recognize their lack of
money management skills until faced with a financial crisis,"
said Bernie Dancel, founder and CEO of the National Credit
Counceling Services.
</P>
<P>
The fact is there is a serious consumer debt problem, and
everyone could benefit from going "back to school" to learn the
ABC's of budgeting and handling credit, said Dancel, whose company
receives hundreds of calls a week about debt management.
</P>
<P>
Among those polled, nearly 50 percent state they would be
stronger money managers if they could improve their financial
skills through training. The study also revealed that nearly half
of American families do not believe that they received adequate
money management training.
</P>
<P>
Consumer debt has soared 39 percent in the last five years and
now exceeds 1 trillion U.S. dollars, according to the Consumer
Credit Delinquency Bulletin. For every dollar of income earned
over the past five years, consumers spend 1.10 U.S. dollars. That
has helped push consumer debt to record levels and has resulted in
record debt, delinquencies and bankruptcies, according to
researchers involved in the survey.
</P>
<P>
Last year, more than 1 million consumers filed for personal
bankruptcies, discharging 30 billion U.S. dollars in consumer
debt. This translates to 300 U.S. dollars for every American
household. Those losses are passed on to all consumers in the form
of higher interest rates and higher prices for goods and services.

NEW YORK, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Weakness of blue-chip issues
weighed down the Dow industrials, but broader stock measures rose
today and smaller-company shares pushed further into record
territory.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 27.40 to 7,867.24 after
recovering over the final hour from a 76-point drop.
</P>
<P>
All other popular stock measures posted modest gains, however,
with the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies cruising to its
sixth consecutive record high and its ninth straight winning
session.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a nearly 8-to-7
margin on the NYSE, where volume was heavy again at 559.33 million
shares, up slightly from Wednesday's 548.72 million.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 3.01 to 930.87, the
NYSE composite index rose 1.40 to 485.11, and the Nasdaq composite
index rose 6.39 to 1,624.63.
</P>
<P>
The Russell 2000 rose 0.92 to 429.71, and the American Stock
Exchange composite, which has a large constituency of smaller
companies, closed at a record high for the third straight day,
rising 2.26 to 662.26.

<HEADLINE> US Deploys Special Air Force in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States will send
more F-16 jet fighters to form a special force to help the
NATO-led Stabilization Force (SFOR) in Bosnia during the municipal
elections on September 13 and 14, the Pentagon said today.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the decision at a regular briefing, Michael
Doubleday, a Pentagon spokesman, said that six F-16s will fly from
Spangdahlem in Germany to join 12 F-16s in Aviano Air Base in
Italy for Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the 18 F-16s will form a special U.S.
Air Expeditionary Force in Aviano on September 8-22. The temporary
force will be joined by U.S. KC-135 refueling planes and C-130
cargo aircraft from bases in Britain.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first deployment of the Air Expeditionary Force
in a European Theater by the U.S. Air Force. Such a force was
deployed temporarily in the past in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
"This is a part of the overall picture, which is one of
measures ensuring that people on the ground realize that there is
a NATO (the North Atlantic Treaty Organization) presence. It
includes not only the SFOR troops but air assets also," he said.
</P>
<P>
"These aircraft will play a role overhead in Bosnia of ensuring
that the environment on the ground remains such that people can
get to the polling places and vote," Doubleday added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said it plans to go ahead with the
elections in Bosnia despite a sometimes-violent political struggle
in Bosnian Serb territory.

<HEADLINE> US Working Women Say Tougher to Make Ends Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Many working women in the
U.S. said making ends meet has become more difficult in the last
five years despite the economic growth and low inflation, an
AFL-CIO survey found.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-seven percent of the women surveyed replied that making
a living has become harder, compared with 29 percent who said it
has gotten easier, according to the AFL-CIO study "Ask a Working
Woman."
</P>
<P>
Thirty-two percent also complained that their jobs do not
provide equal pay for equal work despite near-unanimity (99
percent) that equality is important.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that 64 percent of working women earned half
or more of their household incomes.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-two percent of working mothers with children under six
said child care is "very important," the survey found, but just 13
percent of them have jobs that provide such programs.
</P>
<P>
Forty-one percent of the respondents also contended that job
security has gotten worse for women in the last five years of
corporate downsizing and layoffs.
</P>
<P>
The random-sample telephone survey of 725 working women was
conducted between July 30 and August 3. The survey was
supplemented by AFL-CIO questionnaires distributed nationwide
between February and August to American women.

JOHANNESBURG, September 4 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's
state-owned arms producer DENEL recently did successful weapon
testing for a Swedish manufacturer at its Overberg missile test
range in Western Cape Province, local television reported today.
</P>
<P>
The test range near Arniston, until recently highly secret,

</P>
<P>
The range was built at a cost of hundreds of millions of
Rands.
</P>
<P>
DENEL's General Manager Jan Malan said that the range is
important to South Africa's arms industry because it allows "the
clever buying and use of equipment", and the demonstration to

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Authorities have moved
UNABOMber suspect Theodore Kaczynski from Sacramento County Jail
to a federal prison 20 miles southeast of Oakland in California.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said Kaczynski's lawyers requested the transfer,
which was completed Wednesday, 10 weeks before his trial begins in
Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the 55-year-old former college mathematics
instructor had complained of noise in the jail, although they
declined to say if that was the reason for the transfer.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Dan Lewis, the jail's executive director, said the Federal
Correctional Institution near Pleasanton holds a higher number of
white collar criminals and may be quieter.
</P>
<P>
Kacznski is expected to be returned to Sacramento for his trial
on November 12. He is charged in four bombings that killed two men
and wounded two others.
</P>
<P>
Explosive devices placed or mailed by the notorious UNABOMber
killed three people and injured 23 during a 17-year reign of
terror that began in 1978. The terrorist is so dubbed because his
first targets included universities and airlines.
</P>
<P>
Kaczynski was arrested in a cabin in Montana in April last
year.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Students Required to Do Community Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Chicago's public high
school students will be required to join a growing number of
youths across the United States to do community service before
their graduation, city officials said.
</P>
<P>
Starting with the class of 1999, they'll have to put in 60
hours of work during their four years to earn their diplomas, Paul
Vallas, the school system's chief executive officer, was quoted
by the Associated Press as saying.
</P>
<P>
Vallas said the requirement would instill "values, ethics and
morals" into the mind of the young people.
</P>
<P>
The community service includes working at nursing homes,
day-care centers, hospitals and tutoring younger students.
</P>
<P>
"There's no better way to teach and reinforce these things than
to have children perform community service," Vallas said.
</P>
<P>
Similar policies are in place in many communities across the
country. Some 50 seniors were prevented from graduation last May
by such a policy in Maryland state.

LONDON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Leading stock markets in Europe
ended mixed in thin trading volumes today, with many dealers

</P>
<P>
British shares in London made modest gains, with the FTSE 100

stronger futures helped to offset a weak performance on Wall

However, the DAX-30 index in Frankfurt ended lower, with many

index fell 31.97 points to 4,071.68 by the end of the session.

<P>
French stocks recovered from an early slide as bonds came off
lows although trading was cautious ahead of US economic data. The

<HEADLINE> German Ruling Parties Pledge to Hold on to Euro Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 4 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its sister party Christian
Social Union (CSU) today agreed to hold on to the planned 1999
launch of the single European currency with strict adherence to
the qualification criteria.
</P>
<P>
The common position was reached by the CDU and the CSU during
their so-called strategy summit today in Kloster Andechs in the
southern German state of Bavaria.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the meeting, German Finance Minister and CSU
leader Theo Waigel expressed optimism that Germany would be able
to reduce its budget deficit to 2.9 percent of the gross domestic
product (GDP) by the end of this year, which is better than the
3.0-percent limit required for Euro membership.
</P>

During the summit, which is also attended by Kohl, the two
ruling parties also agreed to continue to seek compromise with the
main opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) on tax and pension
reforms. Moreover, they also agreed to focus attention on job
creation and combating crimes in the run-up to the next general
elections due in September 1998.
