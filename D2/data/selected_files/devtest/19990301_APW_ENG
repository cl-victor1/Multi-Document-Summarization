<HEADLINE> U.N. Land-Mine Treaty Takes Effect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- An international treaty to ban the land mines that  
kill and maim 25,000 people each year went into effect Monday, an 
achievement praised by U.N. officials and celebrated by the joyful 
pealing of church bells. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty, concluded in Ottawa in December 1997, has been  
signed by 133 countries and ratified by 66 of them. It commits 
those nations to ban the production, use, stocks and exports of 
anti-personnel mines. About 12 countries have destroyed their 
stocks entirely. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great day,'' said Jody Williams, who won the Nobel  
Peace Prize for campaigning for the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Major users and producers, including the United States, Russia  
and China, have refused to sign up. And even with the best will in 
the world, it will take decades to clear the tens of millions of 
mines which are scattered in more than 60 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has set 2006 as a target for joining the  
accord -- saying that in the interim the United States needs to use 
mines along the tense border between North and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	``The battle ahead is to make this treaty full effective not  
just in law but also in implementation,'' said U.N. 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan. ``Not just in the capitals of the 
signatories but also in the fields and forests where mines still 
exist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seats for the U.S. delegation were empty at the start of a  
ceremony at U.N. headquarters in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's particularly regrettable that in the United States the  
issue has for the moment become less urgent,'' said Belgian Prime 
Minister Eric Derycke in Brussels. ``We won't convince Russia and 
China to sign the treaty if we don't convince the United States 
first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Walker, coordinator of the International Campaign to Ban  
Land Mines -- which won the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize with Williams -- 
said her group would this year focus its campaign on the Middle 
East and former Soviet Union to try to persuade them to sign the 
ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathedral and church bells throughout the world chimed to mark  
the occasion, and a choir marked the event in the Austrian capital 
Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
	At U.N. European headquarters in Geneva, a large display panel  
featured photos of shattered limbs and tales of shattered lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``My friend told me to cut grass for the sheep behind the  
village,'' recounted 9-year-old Fanar Zekri Baker of northern Iraq. 
``I didn't want to go but she challenged me, saying `Are you a man 
or what?' and I went.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seconds later the blast hit.  
</P>
<P>
	``I looked down at my legs and they were gone,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Fanar was treated at a hospital run by the International  
Committee of the Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 1979 and 1999, the ICRC manufactured over 130,000  
artificial limbs, over 175,000 pairs of crutches and close to 9,000 
wheelchairs.

<HEADLINE> N.J. Police Superintendent Is Fired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Less than two weeks ago, Gov. Christie  
Whitman stood firmly behind New Jersey's top cop when a black 
ministers' group demanded his resignation, citing a racial 
profiling controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	But after State Police Superintendent Col. Carl A. Williams Jr.  
was quoted in The Star-Ledger of Newark on Sunday as saying that 
minorities were more likely to be involved in drug crimes, Whitman 
swiftly fired him. 
</P>
<P>
	``The comments were insensitive and absolutely counter to  
bolstering confidence in law enforcement,'' said Whitman's 
spokesman, Pete McDonough. ``There are vast segments of the New 
Jersey public whose confidence in the system is shaken.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state Council of Black Ministers and the state chapter of  
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People had 
been calling for Williams' ouster for weeks, saying he wasn't 
acknowledging a history of racist practices on the part of the 
state police. 
</P>
<P>
	Minority groups say Williams stated what a lot of his colleagues  
probably believe. 
</P>
<P>
	``If these feelings are of the state superintendent, one can  
only imagine how deep they may be among the rank and file,'' said 
the Rev. Reginald Jackson, executive director of the Black 
Ministers Council of New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams and the State Police have come under fire over  
allegations that the agency practices racial profiling, targeting 
minorities for traffic stops. The issue was inflamed by the April 
1998 shooting of three minority men during a stop on the New Jersey 
Turnpike. Troopers said they fired on the unarmed men in a van 
because the vehicle was backing up at them. 
</P>
<P>
	In The Star-Ledger interview, Williams said he did not condone  
racial profiling, but said it is naive to think race is not an 
issue in drug crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two weeks ago, the president of the United States went to  
Mexico to talk to the president of Mexico about drugs. He didn't go 
to Ireland. He didn't go to England,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today with this drug problem, the drug problem is cocaine or  
marijuana. It is most likely a minority group that's involved with 
that,'' said Williams. ``They aren't going to ask some Irishman to 
be a part of their (gang) because they don't trust them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said some generalizations can be made. ``If you're  
looking at the methamphetamine market, that seems to be controlled 
by the motorcycle gangs, which are basically predominantly white,'' 
he said. ``If you're looking at heroin and stuff like that, your 
involvement there is more or less Jamaicans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman said the state's law enforcement system must be carried  
out free of bias. She said Williams' comments ``are inconsistent 
with our efforts to enhance public confidence in the state 
police.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``His views are dastardly, his thoughts are ill and sickened,  
and he's unfit to hold such a critical, important office that 
protects,'' said Assemblyman LeRoy D. Jones. ``He's a racist in the 
worst kind because he doesn't even know it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, 58, was tapped for the $89,963 superintendent post in  
1994. He has been in law enforcement for almost 35 years. Williams 
was not available for comment, and a State Police spokesman did not 
return messages seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, The Associated Press reported that The Justice  
Department's Civil Rights Division has been investigating New 
Jersey's state police for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, State Attorney General Peter Verniero ordered  
his office to review State Police policies to determine if troopers 
engage in racial profiling and to ensure that ``all policies 
promote fairness.''

<HEADLINE> Clintons End Vacation a Day Early </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARK CITY, Utah (AP) -- With daughter Chelsea returning to  
college, President Clinton and his wife decided to return home 
Monday a day early from a long weekend at a posh ski resort. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's just ready to go back, go back to work,'' presidential  
senior advisor Doug Sosnik said. Presidential spokesman Barry Toiv 
said the Clintons decided to ``get home a day early'' because they 
have a full schedule this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons arrived here Saturday. The president and his wife  
Hillary had been scheduled to return to Washington on Tuesday. Toiv 
said Chelsea was leaving on schedule Monday to return to classes at 
Stanford University. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going back a couple hours early so we can get a better  
night's sleep,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his only public outing, the president strolled downtown and  
popped into the Main Street Deli for coffee and peach yogurt. His 
visit caused a huge commotion, stopping cars and causing crowds to 
gather on the street. ``Say hello to Hillary, we love her,'' a 
well-wisher shouted. ``Thank you, we had a wonderful day,'' the 
president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also stopped in Dolly's, a book and record store, where  
he bought three books, including John Grisham's ``The Testament.'' 
The president also was given a copy of ``Park City Witness,'' 
written by a local author. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what he thought about the Salt Lake City Olympics, Clinton  
said, ``I'm looking forward to it. I think Salt Lake will do a 
great job with it.'' Salt Lake City's winning bid for the 2002 
Winter Games has been tarnished by allegations of payoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, who does not ski, had spent Sunday reading by the fire  
while the first lady and Chelsea were out on the slopes. Saturday 
was Chelsea's 19th birthday, and the family celebrated at home with 
a private dinner and cake. 
</P>
<P>
	With the unexpected decision to leave, there was a scramble to  
notify members of Clinton's entourage spread out in dozens of 
condos and homes throughout the region. White House aides hurriedly 
tried to bring in a plane for the traveling press corps. 
</P>
<P>
	Toiv said there was no emergency or urgent reason for Clinton to  
return. ``They just decided they would leave today.'' The president 
has no public events on his schedule Tuesday but is to fly to New 
Jersey for a fundraiser on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons spent the weekend at the gated multimillion-dollar  
estate of Hollywood executive Jeffrey Katzenberg in the exclusive 
Deer Valley Resort.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stock Prices Fall Again / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stock prices fell today for the second  
consecutive trading day amid continued worries over Japanese 
corporate earnings. The dollar slipped against the yen on 
profit-taking. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 119.12 yen in late afternoon, down 1.20 yen  
from late Friday in Tokyo and also below its New York level of 
119.17 yen late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 145.79 points,  
or 1.01 percent, closing at 14,221.75 points. On Friday, the index 
lost 102.91 points, or 0.71 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock prices started sliding decisively in late afternoon when a  
report hit the market that Fujitsu Ltd., a major Japanese computer 
maker, expected to record the first net loss for its parent company 
in six years. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Tokyo market closed, Fujitsu forecast its net loss  
would amount to $168 million for the parent company, citing 
weaker-than-expected demand for telecommunications equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Also making investors bearish were continued worries about the  
sale of corporate shareholdings ahead of the end of the fiscal 
year, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's fiscal year ends March 31.  
</P>
<P>
	The market was also hurt by a 59.76 point fall in the Dow Jones  
industrial average Friday to 9,306.58, and a sense that U.S. share 
prices are overvalued, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 12.22 points, or 1.09 percent, to 1,107.81 
points at today's close. On Friday, the TOPIX lost 4.10 points, or 
0.36 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 420  
million shares, down from Friday's 469 million shares. Decliners 
outnumbered advancers 707 to 435, with 165 issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar faced selling by U.S. funds to  
take profits despite some buying from Japanese bank players on 
dips. 
</P>
<P>
	The greenback's up-side was limited by yen repatriation from  
overseas by Japanese corporations to prepare for their 
book-closing. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading remained in a narrow range as many investors held back  
to watch at high-level talks on economic deregulation between Japan 
and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were alert to comments from finance officials during  
the talks and also watched a World Bank symposium on global finance 
and development in Tokyo, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 118.85 yen and 119.44 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 130.86 yen, down  
from 132.35 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.860 percent from today's finish of 1.885 percent, 
driving its price up to 99.52 yen from 99.32 yen.

<HEADLINE> EU OKs Zeneca-Astra Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A proposed merger that would create one of the  
world's biggest pharmaceutical companies edged closer to completion 
Monday after would-be partners Zeneca Group PLC and Astra AB won 
approval of the European Union. 
</P>
<P>
	The approval of EU antitrust regulators was one of the hurdles  
that Zeneca, a British company, and Astra of Sweden had to pass 
before merging. The new company, to be called AstraZeneca, will 
have combined annual drug sales of about $11.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair still need the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to sign  
off on the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Astra's shareholders, including a block of small investors  
skeptical of the marriage, also must agree. The shareholders have 
until March 18 to vote on the proposed merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Zeneca and Astra, which announced their merger in December, are  
among a handful of pharmaceutical companies consolidating to 
compete more effectively with heavyweights like Britain's Glaxo 
Wellcome and Pfizer and Merck &AMP; Co. of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's Hoechst and France's Rhone-Poulenc have agreed to  
merge their drug and agrochemical businesses as the first step 
toward a total merger. However, Hoechst spokesman Carsten Tilger 
declined to comment on a report that its largest shareholder, 
Kuwait Petroleum Corp., is divided over whether to back the 
proposed merger. The deal would create the world's biggest life 
sciences group, based on 1997 sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Astra's ulcer and heartburn drug Prilosec is the world's  
best-selling prescription medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Zeneca is the second-leading maker of cancer drugs behind  
Bristol-Myers Squibb of the United States. It also has a large 
agrochemical business and owns Salick Health Care, a U.S. operator 
of cancer treatment and dialysis centers. 
</P>
<P>
	As a condition for its approval, the European Union is asking  
Zeneca to return the license for an anesthetic to Britain's 
Chiroscience Group PLC, due to concerns that Zeneca's merger with 
Astra, which sells two anesthetics of its own, would hinder 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	To further satisfy EU authorities, Zeneca will set up a  
third-party distribution network in Sweden and Norway for its beta 
blocker Tenormin. Astra, for its part, has been told to sell off 
its European beta blocker and diuretic combination drug business.

<HEADLINE> Genetic Switch-Prostate Cancer Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Scientists have found that a gene implicated in advanced breast  
cancer in women also plays a pivotal role in the final stages of 
prostate cancer in men. 
</P>
<P>
	The complicity of the HER-2 gene raises the possibility that  
Herceptin, a breakthrough breast-cancer drug that has extended the 
lives of many critically ill women, might do the same for men. 
</P>
<P>
	Herceptin already is being tested in several medical centers to  
treat prostate cancer, the second-leading cancer killer of men. 
</P>
<P>
	The HER-2 research is part of two studies of prostate cancer  
genes published in the March issue of the journal Nature Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	``If HER-2 is indeed involved, we may see a new treatment sooner  
than we thought,'' said Tapio Visakorpi, a Finnish cancer 
researcher who reviewed the studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Every year, an estimated 184,500 American men develop prostate  
cancer, and more than 41,000 die from it, according to the American 
Cancer Society. Among men, it is the second-deadliest type of 
cancer, after lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1941, doctors have known that prostate cancer is  
stimulated by androgens, or male sex hormones. Since then, a 
standard treatment has been to surgically or chemically castrate 
patients to eliminate the cancer's primary source of androgens. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the cancer eventually can rejuvenate without androgens  
and fatally spread to surrounding bones and tissue. 
</P>
<P>
	In a study at UCLA, researchers determined that the cancer  
rebounds because the HER-2 gene begins to overproduce a protein 
that mimics the male hormones. 
</P>
<P>
	In September, the government approved the bioengineered drug  
Herceptin to treat late-stage breast cancer. Herceptin stimulates 
the immune system to produce an antibody that blocks excess HER2 
activity. In about half of the breast cancer patients tested, 
Herceptin shrank tumors substantially. 
</P>
<P>
	More studies are planned to see if Herceptin can shrink prostate  
tumors, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Some researchers are not so sure Herceptin would be effective.  
</P>
<P>
	HER-2 plays a lesser role in prostate cancer than in some cases  
of breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``An unanswered question is whether HER2 is present as a result  
of cancer or whether it actually contributes to causing the 
cancer,'' said urologist Dr. Martin Sanda of the University of 
Michigan. ``The changes in HER-2 are more subtle than in breast 
cancer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate study, scientists at Johns Hopkins University  
found evidence that mutations in a gene that is supposed to 
suppress tumors may play a role in causing prostate cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	In 87 percent of 55 cancerous prostates examined, the  
researchers found that the pp32 gene had been turned off in the 
tumor tissue but was present in the healthy surrounding tissue. 
They also found that two mutations of the gene had been turned on 
in the tumor tissue but not in the healthy tissue. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a rare commodity when you have whole prostate out and can  
look at cancer and normal tissue in the same patient,'' Dr. Gary 
Pasternak of Johns Hopkins. ``The first three out of the box 
displayed these changes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers said the discovery of the pp32 genetic switch opens  
new possibilities for prostate cancer screening and treatment. 
``The p32 gene still is there. We're looking for the right key to 
turn it back on,'' Pasternak said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other scientists noted that the Johns Hopkins team has not shown  
that the mutations actually cause cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The study is still very preliminary,'' said Robert Matusik,  
urology research director at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. 
``Gene expression is a very complex process, and developing 
therapies rapidly will be difficult.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Smog Level in L.A. Unlawful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some Los Angeles-area residents could be  
breathing levels of toxic pollution hundreds of times higher than 
standards set by the federal Clean Air Act, said a congressional 
staff report released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Exposure to the 10 hazardous air pollutants measured at three  
monitors in Los Angeles and suburbs Long Beach and Burbank could 
cause as many as 426 additional cases of cancer per million exposed 
individuals, said the report, written by Democratic staff on the 
House Government Reform Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Clean Air Act standards are aimed at reducing the cancer risk  
from exposure to major sources of hazardous air pollutants to one 
in 1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The level of toxic pollutants in the air is much too high,''  
said Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., who requested the report. ``The 
report is a wake-up call that we must do a lot more to reduce toxic 
emissions, especially from cars and trucks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report's findings, however, do not mean that the city's  
residents are in any immediate danger from short-term exposure, 
Waxman said. Risk estimates are based on the assumption that 
individuals experience 70 years of exposure, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Waxman said, there is ``considerable scientific  
uncertainty associated with cancer risk estimates.'' The report 
said they are based on studies that exposed animals to high doses 
of hazardous air pollutants, and they are not an exact science. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the uncertainties, the study said many Los Angeles  
residents are breathing in excessive levels of hazardous pollutants 
even though authorities have successfully reduced air pollution in 
the area since passage in 1990 of the Clean Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the report shows is that despite this progress, we still  
have a long way to go,'' Waxman said. 
</P>
<P>
	He called the report the first to analyze levels of hazardous  
air that people breathe in the Los Angeles area or anywhere else in 
the country. Previous studies determined only the amount of 
pollution emitted by factories, motor vehicles and other sources. 
Some have argued that people do not breathe all pollution released 
into the air. 
</P>
<P>
	The South Coast Air Quality Management District began a similar  
study last year to determine cancer risks from toxic pollutants in 
neighborhoods. Initial results, due later this month, come to the 
same conclusions as the congressional report, the agency's 
executive officer, Barry Wallerstein, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears that motor vehicles create the largest portion of  
the toxic risk in terms of their emissions,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The congressional report analyzes data from pollutants monitored  
from January 1995 to April 1998. Two monitors were in residential 
areas, and the one in Burbank was in a commercial area. 
</P>
<P>
	Primary sources of the three pollutants that appeared to pose  
the greatest risks -- 1,3-butadiene, formaldehyde and benzene -- are 
mobile sources such as cars, trucks and off-road vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the levels measured in Los Angeles, the lifetime cancer  
risks for these hazardous air pollutants could be as high as 258 in 
a million for butadiene, 72 in a million for formaldehyde and 49 in 
a million for benzene,'' the report said. ``In total, nine of the 
10 hazardous air pollutants analyzed in this study appear to 
present cancer risks higher than the Clean Air Act goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 10 hazardous pollutants monitored at the three locations  
were benzene, 1,3-butadiene, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, 
chromium, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, formaldehyde, methylene chloride, 
perchloroethylene and trichloroethylene. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said 1,3-butadiene is a byproduct of combustion that  
has been found in animal studies to cause cancer in the heart, 
lungs, mammary glands, ovaries, stomach, liver, pancreas, thyroid, 
testes. 
</P>
<P>
	The report calls formaldehyde a probable human carcinogen that  
has been found to cause lung cancer in animal studies. And benzene 
is a known human carcinogen that has been found to cause leukemia 
and cancers of the lymphoid system, skin, ovary, lung and mammary 
glands.

<HEADLINE> Wall St. Stocks End Higher / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors swapped technology shares for  
financial and manufacturing stocks Monday, lifting the Dow Jones 
industrials out of a morning loss but leaving broader indexes 
nearly flat. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average ended up 18.20 at 9,324.78,  
after erasing an 83.40-point loss that was tied to an increase in 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 2.17  
to 1,236.16, but the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index added 
7.15 to 2,295.18. 
</P>
<P>
	While investors continued last week's strategy of jettisoning  
technology issues for most of the session, they also began picking 
selectively at the shares of large financial and smokestack 
companies. And at the end of the day, even technology shares were 
above their intraday lows. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in a tug-of-war between those who think the market is  
overvalued, and bargain hunters who want to buy it at every dip,'' 
said Ricky Harrington, a technical analyst at Interstate/Johnson 
Lane in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow was led higher by Caterpillar, up 3 5/8 at 49 3/16 and  
Citigroup, up 2 1/2 at 61 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial stocks benefited as long-term interest rates rose  
faster than short-term rates, widening the spread between the two. 
A wider spread lowers financial companies' cost of funds while at 
the same time enabling them to raising lending rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Cyclical stocks like Caterpillar rose on the perception that  
economic growth is still strong, a position confirmed by data 
released in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported that Americans' personal  
incomes climbed a robust 0.6 percent in January, suggesting that 
they entered 1999 with enough buying power to keep the economic 
expansion going. Also, spending rose a moderate 0.3 percent, 
hinting that Americans might be willing to start saving a little 
more money that will find its way into mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the National Association of Purchasing Management  
reported its index of purchasing activity rose to 52.4 percent in 
February from 49.5 percent in January. Any reading over 50 means 
the economy is expanding. 
</P>
<P>
	In the bond market, both reports only extended last week's worry  
that the economy is growing fast enough to spark inflation, which 
could prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten short-term interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bond market boys are nervous. They're totally freaked,''  
said Barry Hyman, senior equity analyst at Ehrenkrantz King 
Nussbaum. ``The bond market is acting like there's an interest rate 
hike coming at the (Fed's) March meeting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year Treasury bond was down 1 9/32, pushing its yield up  
to 5.67 percent from 5.57 percent late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets are expected to tread water for most of the  
week, however, until unemployment data is released on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, computer stocks had their own problems, mostly tied  
to dour predictions about personal computer sales, but they 
recovered some ground by the end of the day. Internet stocks were 
strong throughout the session. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel fell 2 7/8 to 117 1/16. Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette  
Securities downgraded the semiconductor maker's stock to ``market 
perform'' from ``buy,'' saying March PC sales won't be as robust as 
previously expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow members IBM and Hewlett-Packard, plus Sun Microsystems, all  
fell after Lehman Brothers lowered its earnings projections for 
those companies. IBM dropped 1 3/8 to 168 3/8 after falling as much as 
4 5/8, Hewlett fell 5/8 to 65 7/8 after being down as much as 3 1/16, while 
Sun ended 1/16 lower at 97 1/4 in Nasdaq trading, after nearly 
recouping a loss of 3 3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by nearly 5 to 4 on the  
New York Stock Exchange. Consolidated volume was moderately heavy 
at 832.11 million shares, below Friday's pace of 933.89 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 1.03 to 585.43 , and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was unchanged at 698.29. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.13 to 394.39. 
</P>
<P>
	In overseas trading, the Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo dropped 1.01  
percent. In Europe, Frankfurt's DAX index fell 2.60 percent, the 
FT-SE 100 in London declined 1.85 percent, and the CAC in Paris 
lost 1.49 percent.

<HEADLINE> Maggert Full of Surprises in Match  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                            *Golf Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- In the strongest field ever assembled  
for match play, no one expected Jeff Maggert to be the player who 
could make it through five days, six matches and 127 holes of golf 
and walk away with $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Not even his 10-year-old son.  
</P>
<P>
	Having taken his first big scalp with a one-birdie, no-bogey,  
1-up victory over Nick Price in the second round, Maggert called 
his son in Houston and laid out the scenario: If he were to win his 
morning match over Berhnard Langer, he might get to play Tiger 
Woods in the quarterfinals that afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, no,'' his son told him. ``You can't beat Tiger Woods.''  
</P>
<P>
	In a week that didn't pan out the way anyone expected at La  
Costa Resort, Maggert was full of surprises. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest of all was that he won, something he had not done in  
over five years. 
</P>
<P>
	His victims included Price, Langer and Woods, who have combined  
to win six major championships and 100 tournaments around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	If that wasn't enough, he brought the first World Golf  
Championship event to a sudden, stunning conclusion by chipping in 
from 20 feet on the 38th hole to defeat Andrew Magee and win the 
richest prize in tour history. 
</P>
<P>
	``My son has been giving me a hard time about finishing  
second,'' Maggert said. ``But he's been an inspiration to me the 
last few years, because he does get on me. It's not, 'Oh, Dad, I'm 
sorry you finished second.' It's, 'Dad, how come you can't win?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Maggert was beginning to wonder that himself.  
</P>
<P>
	His only victory was the 1993 Disney Classic, which he actually  
won at night because tournament officials had to set up floodlights 
to beat the darkness. He blew third-round leads on Sunday by 
shooting 78, got blown by in the final round last year when David 
Duval posted a 64 in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1993, he has finished second 13 times, more than anyone  
else on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``To talk to the press, it was almost like a tape recording to  
me,'' Maggert said. ``I knew what I was going to say before I even 
came in. But I knew inside of myself that I had what it took to win 
golf tournaments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And as he showed this week, he has what it takes to win in match  
play. 
</P>
<P>
	No, he's not a power hitter like Woods or Duval. Maggert was  
52nd in driving distance in 1994 and has gotten worse each year, 
tumbling to 143rd last year. 
</P>
<P>
	He couldn't be considered a clutch player, not with all those  
second-place finishes. 
</P>
<P>
	He is far from intimidating, a 35-year-old who smiles about as  
often as the sun shines in Pebble Beach the first week in February. 
</P>
<P>
	But behind the plaid look is a colorful pattern of match-play  
success. He is 3-2 in two Ryder Cup appearances, including a 3 and 
2 victory over Lee Westwood in Valderrama, and has won Diner Club 
Matches with two players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the biggest thing about my golf game is I don't give  
away holes, and I feel like I'm a good pressure player,'' Maggert 
said. ``I drive the ball straight. I hit a lot of fairways. I think 
that's very important in match play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most important ingredient is patience, which Maggert  
displayed during his five-year hiatus from the winner's circle. And 
he was not in short supply of it this week. 
</P>
<P>
	He came from behind in five of his six matches, and was  
particularly strong from the quarterfinals on. He trailed Woods by 
two holes after seven, caught him with two birdies and then took 
the lead with a 40-foot eagle putt. He was three down to Steve Pate 
in the semifinals with seven to play when he made another run to 
advance 1-up. 
</P>
<P>
	Against Magee in the 36-hole finals, he didn't lead a hole from  
the time he walked off the fourth green in the morning until Magee 
congratulated him on the 38th hole as the sun was setting over the 
foothills north of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	By that time, Woods, Duval, Ernie Els, Davis Love III, Mark  
O'Meara and all the other players ranked in the top 20 were long 
gone. Woods was the only player in the top 10 who advanced to the 
quarterfinals, leaving ABC Sports with a weekend of tour grinders 
in their mid-30s. 
</P>
<P>
	Maggert offered no apologies.  
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, this is probably the biggest win of my career,'' he  
said. ``You've got the top 64 guys in the world playing, and match 
play is a very difficult format to win. This is not an easy week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When it was over, Maggert left the interview room with a  
cellular phone to his ear, perhaps giving his son the same message 
he had when he walked into the interview room Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't have to ask me what it feels like to finish  
second,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Dole's Help Asked in Kosovo Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is  
reaching out to defeated Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole 
to help the Clinton administration reach a peaceful settlement in 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	And Dole has agreed at least in principle to talk to the  
province's ethnic Albanians. He also may go to Belgrade to try 
diplomacy on the Yugoslavia's leaders, who so far have refused to 
accept either a NATO peacekeeping force in their province or all of 
the provisions of a self-rule plan for the Kosovo Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of the ethnic Albanians also have accepted in principle  
an administration invitation to attend talks with U.S. officials in 
Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Foley and other 
administration officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no decision when the talks would be held or which  
Albanians would come, Foley said. But, he said, ``It is our 
expectation some will come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Announcing Albright's telephoned overture to Dole, Foley said  
the Kansas Republican is ``an eminent figure'' who has spoken out 
in behalf of the ethnic Albanians and therefore is thought well of 
by them. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would be able to speak to them on behalf of the United  
States as someone who is concerned about their situation and their 
future,'' the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole could not be reached for comment. His spokesman, Douglas  
MacKinnon, said he did not know about Dole's plans but said of the 
Balkans: ``It's clearly an issue that is very important to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last June, Dole said NATO should conduct air strikes against  
military installations in Serbia unless President Slobodan 
Milosevic halted attacks in Kosovo and agreed to peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole said the Clinton administration had been too tolerant of  
Milosevic's crackdown on ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	As Senate majority leader in 1995, Dole supported President  
Clinton's decision to dispatch U.S. troops to Bosnia to help 
enforce a settlement that ended an ethnic conflict among Serbs, 
Croats and Muslims in that former Yugoslav republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright also called Dole last month while holding talks with  
the two sides in Rambouillet, France, and asked him to intercede 
with the ethnic Albanians, many of whom seek independence and not 
just the self-rule promised by the proposed settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Accusing both the Serbs and ethnic Albanians of bloody attacks  
in recent days, Foley condemned the continuing violence and said 
the United States is keeping close watch on a buildup of Serbian 
troops on the Kosovo border. 
</P>
<P>
	At the windup of the latest round of negotiations last week in  
France, Albright again warned the Serbs they risked NATO 
bombardment if they violated the cease-fire arranged last October 
by U.S. mediator Richard Holbrooke. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the Serbs were in violation now, Foley said: ``It's  
murky. There have been killings on both sides.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Pentagon, Defense Secretary William Cohen noted the  
buildup near a town in southwestern Kosovo and threatened a NATO 
response if innocent Kosovars are attacked. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have indicated is, if the Serbs, by virtue of their  
heavy armor and their artillery, start to engage in massive 
assaults upon innocent villagers, that would constitute a violation 
of the agreement that was negotiated ... back in the fall, and that 
would prompt an attack by the NATO forces,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he is worried that violence will resume before adjourned  
peace talks are reconvened. 
</P>
<P>
	The partial accord concluded last week gave the ethnic Albanians  
two weeks to consider the deal and to sell it to the people in the 
predominantly Albanian southern Serbia province. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
the ethnic Albanians accepted in principle the invitation to 
Washington, and the next step would be for them to propose a date 
for the visit. 
</P>
<P>
	In responding to the U.S. invitation, the Albanians did not say  
who would participate in the talks, the U.S. official said, 
although any delegation probably would include leaders of the 
Kosovo Liberation Army. The KLA, which wants to secede from Serbia, 
has fought for a year with Serbian troops and special police. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rambouillet agreement arranged by Albright offers Kosovo  
self-rule, or autonomy, but not independence. 
</P>
<P>
	In extending the invitations, administration officials hoped to  
improve the Kosovo Albanians' ``comfort level'' with discussion of 
how the accord would be carried out. 
</P>
<P>
	Of particular concern to the ethnic Albanians is the future of  
the KLA. 
</P>
<P>
	As currently written, the settlement would disarm the KLA's  
fighters while most of the Serb troops and special police units 
would be withdrawn from Kosovo. Many of the fighters are eligible 
to be absorbed into a Kosovo police force, provided they qualify. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the Albanians the administration would like to see come to  
Washington is Hashim Thaci, who headed the Albanian delegation at 
the talks in France. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serbs have not accepted various parts of the self-rule plan  
or a NATO peacekeeping force of some 28,000 troops, including about 
4,000 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations are to resume March 15 in France.

<HEADLINE> Government Calls Intel a Monopolist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government portrayed Intel Corp. as an  
out-of-control monopolist Monday, accusing the world's largest 
manufacturer of computer processors of bullying other companies 
until they surrendered valuable secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	In turn, Intel rejected the Federal Trade Commission's  
characterization, arguing that even the government's own expert 
economist cannot point to any rivals harmed by its behavior, which 
it called ``fundamentally fair.'' It called the pending case before 
an FTC administrative law judge -- pitting the agency against Intel 
-- ``an assault on fundamental antitrust principles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for both Intel and the FTC outlined their strategies  
Monday for the company's upcoming hearing, which starts March 9 and 
is expected to last six to 10 weeks. Together with the government's 
antitrust case in federal court against Microsoft Corp., the legal 
actions confront two of the most important companies in the 
nation's technology industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC alleges that Intel illegally withheld from three  
companies advanced technical information about its upcoming 
microprocessors to ``extort'' valuable technology that the 
companies developed independently. 
</P>
<P>
	It called the company's actions ``a raw exercise of monopoly  
power to muscle competitors into signing over intellectual property 
rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Simply competing on the merits was insufficient,'' FTC lawyers  
wrote. ``... Intel's victims had no choice but to accede to its 
demands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three companies were Digital Equipment Corp., Intergraph  
Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp., which now owns Digital. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, with $26.2 billion in sales last year, makes processors  
for more than 80 percent of the world's computers and last week 
introduced its fastest chip ever, the Pentium III. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC said ``any hope of meaningful challenge'' to Intel's  
dominance relies on other companies developing rival technology. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 71-page filing that quotes the government's own expert  
economist more than anyone else, Intel doesn't deny that it 
withheld technical data about upcoming products. 
</P>
<P>
	But Intel contended it is legal for the company to decide what  
secrets to disclose to its customers about its upcoming products, 
information typically contained within so-called ``color books'' -- 
with red covers for the most sensitive and yellow covers for less 
important details. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel lawyers accused the FTC of trying ``to prevent Intel from  
using its intellectual property to barter in value-for-value 
commercial exchanges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coincidentally, the government's antitrust case comes during a  
period of unprecedented competition facing Intel from rival 
chipmakers, such as from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and National 
Semiconductor Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last week, an industry report showed consumers bought more  
computers in January with AMD processors than Intel -- knocking 
Intel from the No. 1 spot for the first time and sending its stock 
price plummeting more than 6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any reader of personal computer ads today can readily see that  
Intel faces intense competition,'' the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel said the government's own economist, Harvard University  
professor Frederic M. Scherer, found no evidence that innovation in 
the computer industry has suffered. Scherer also is quoted as 
calling Intel's behavior ``unfair'' but agreeing that its actions 
haven't directly affected computer chip prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Scherer predicted that Intel's efforts on the industry  
will ``unravel over a period of 10 or so years, and it's just too 
early to assess those consequences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intel called that ``not a basis for imposing antitrust  
liability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company indicated previously its witnesses will include  
Andrew Grove, Intel's high-profile co-founder and chairman, and 
Craig Barrett, who took over as chief executive officer last year.

<HEADLINE> Barry Bonds Has Spasms in His Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- San Francisco Giants outfielder Barry  
Bonds missed most of workouts Sunday because of spasms in his lower 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	He felt the spasm during a running drill in early in the day. He  
later consulted with team physician Dr. William Montgomery and 
chiropractor Alan Parker. 
</P>
<P>
	``He still has a little soreness,'' said head trainer Mark  
Letendre. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I'll take one more day off. But I don't think it's a big  
deal,'' Bonds told the San Francisco Examiner as he left Scottsdale 
Stadium Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds was back this morning in the Giants spring training  
clubhouse, but there was no immediate word on his status for the 
rest of the day.

<HEADLINE> More Original Content Found on Web </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Newspapers and magazines are increasing the  
original material on their Web sites, part of a shift toward using 
the Internet as a groundbreaking medium rather than a distribution 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	In a survey being released today, 58 percent of newspapers and  
magazines had a Web site. Of those, 31 percent used original 
material for at least half their online content -- more than four 
times the number of publications that did so in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a bigger news hole and wonderful new storytelling  
tools,'' said Steve Ross, who conducted the survey. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he noted that the emphasis on round-the-clock coverage  
had its downside. 
</P>
<P>
	``Journalists often got the story wrong, concentrated on  
breaking news rather than features and skirted long-standing 
ethical practices,'' said Ross, a professor at Columbia 
University's Graduate School of Journalism. 
</P>
<P>
	As examples, he pointed to The Wall Street Journal's and The  
Dallas Morning News' retractions of online stories during the 
Monica Lewinsky scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Ross and a New York public relations firm questioned the  
business editors and managing editors of 1,420 daily newspapers and 
2,000 magazines last fall. This is the fifth year of the survey. 
</P>
<P>
	They found that although publications are developing more  
content specifically for the Web, only 18 percent routinely let 
their Web sites scoop their printed editions. Sixty-two percent 
never allowed it. 
</P>
<P>
	Ross also found that 2 percent of journalists said they had no  
access to the Internet; 5 percent said they never or almost never 
went online. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Some Black Farmers Dislike Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Black farmers opposed to the  
multimillion-dollar settlement of a discrimination lawsuit against 
the Agriculture Department are trying to rally support for their 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
	They planned a protest today outside a U.S. District Court,  
where Judge Paul Friedman scheduled a fairness hearing to review 
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The farmers are having some real issues with what has been  
proposed,'' said Gary Grant, president of the Black Farmers and 
Agriculturists Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for both sides announced a settlement in January to  
the discrimination lawsuit brought by farmers two years ago because 
they were denied access to government loans and subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would allow farmers with less documented evidence to  
take a $50,000 tax-free payment and have their government debts 
forgiven. Farmers with more evidence could opt to go before an 
independent arbitrator and seek larger damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost of the settlement is unclear, because neither the  
number of farmers who will join the class nor settlement options 
they will choose is known. The cost could reach $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of the agreement, many farmers hailed the end of  
sometimes contentious negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	But now, many plaintiffs say that after reading the agreement  
they're not sure they are getting a fair deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The $50,000 payment ``does not compensate somebody who has lost  
their home, their farm, their credibility, their credit rating'' 
Grant said. 
</P>
<P>
	And farmers will have a hard time proving a preponderance of  
evidence to seek larger damages, Grant said. ``We're talking about 
elderly people who have little formal education, who operated in an 
atmosphere of racism and bigotry. People who did not necessarily 
file complaints,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel as though the burden of proof shouldn't be on the  
farmer,'' said John Boyd, president of the National Black Farmers 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the things farmers have mentioned including in the  
settlement are a review board to look over the arbitrator's rulings 
and the firing of department officials in the counties that 
participated in the discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	``We definitely want a settlement,'' Boyd said, ``but we want a  
settlement that's going to be fair to the black farmers who have 
been victims of the Department of Agriculture.''

<HEADLINE> $1.66B in Internet Funds Promised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Schools and libraries are being promised $1.66  
billion to help pay for discounted connections to the Internet, 
says a company designated by federal regulators to hand out the 
money collected through fees on phone bills. 
</P>
<P>
	The Schools and Libraries Division of the Universal Service  
Administrative Company, which is overseen by the Federal 
Communications Commission, did not have a breakdown of how many 
schools and libraries will receive the money because some of the 
25,785 recipients can include entire school districts. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1.66 billion figure is the total amount the division has  
committed in letters sent to schools and libraries between November 
1998 and February 1999 for the program's first funding cycle. Of 
that amount, just more than $53 million has actually been 
disbursed, said the division's president, Kate Moore. The rest 
could be doled out by the end of the year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The total commitments cover most of the applicants who requested  
funds in 1998. Schools and libraries in all 50 states, plus the 
District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, are 
covered. 
</P>
<P>
	More than $2.4 billion in funding had been requested by  
applicants, Moore said. But the FCC authorized a total of $1.93 
billion to be collected from telecommunications companies for the 
first cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	The money comes from fees imposed on telecommunications  
companies, which pass them on to customers in phone bills. The FCC 
oversees the program, which provides eligible schools and libraries 
with discounts that range from 20 percent to 90 percent off the 
costs of various equipment and services they need to connect to the 
Internet, depending on the recipients' needs. 
</P>
<P>
	The neediest schools and libraries, those eligible for discounts  
between 80 percent and 90 percent, accounted for 60 percent of the 
total promised money, the division said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the promised money -- 67 percent -- will go to schools and  
libraries in urban areas, with 22 percent going to applicants in 
rural areas. The geographic status of the remaining 11 percent of 
the promised funding wasn't available, the division said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the funding promised in the first cycle -- 54 percent --  
will help applicants pay for all the internal wiring schools and 
libraries need to hook their computers together or to the Internet, 
the division said. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear when the division will begin funding commitments  
for the program's second cycle and how much money will be 
available. 
</P>
<P>

been promised money is available on the division's web site:

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Want To Reserve Oil Cash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than $4 billion in annual offshore  
oil-drilling royalties collected by the federal government has 
become a tempting windfall for lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation in both houses of Congress would designate about  
half the cash for states and the environment -- $1.9 billion next 
year under the Senate formula and $2.1 billion under the House 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Six states -- Louisiana, Texas, Alaska, California, Mississippi  
and Alabama -- would be the biggest winners because they have 
offshore oil drilling. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana would get the most next year, $359 million under the  
Senate plan, and Texas would finish second with $196 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But coastal states without offshore rigs also would benefit. New  
York would take in $79 million and Washington state would net $31 
million under the Senate formula. And every state and U.S. 
territory would get something. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill will improve the lives of every American,'' Rep. Don  
Young, R-Alaska, said in introducing the House measure last month. 
The Senate bill was introduced in January by Sen. Mary Landrieu, 
D-La. 
</P>
<P>
	Royalties from drilling more than six miles off U.S. coasts now  
go to the U.S. Treasury to finance an array of programs. A portion, 
about $300 million annually in recent years, finances the land and 
water conservation fund, used by the federal government to buy 
environmentally sensitive land. 
</P>
<P>
	Some royalties would continue to go to the Treasury under both  
bills -- 50 percent in the Senate measure and 40 percent in the 
House version. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest would be split three ways.  
</P>
<P>
	--Both bills would allocate 27 percent to 30 states and five  
territories bordering oceans and the Great Lakes. The lawmakers say 
coastal states have special needs to fight erosion, improve water 
quality and address offshore-drilling impact. Coastal states with 
offshore drilling, extensive coastlines and large populations would 
get the lion's share. 
</P>
<P>
	--About one-fourth of the money in the House bill, less in the  
Senate version, would go to the conservation fund and for urban 
parks and recreation. Based on expected royalties next year, the 
Senate formula would allocate about $661 million to the 
conservation fund, while the House bill would provide $900 million. 
</P>
<P>
	--One-tenth of the money in the House bill, less in the Senate,  
would go to fish-and-game programs in all 50 states. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals are among the most closely watched pieces of  
environmental legislation in the 106th Congress -- especially since 
Young, chairman of the House Resources Committee, and another 
supporter, Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, head of the Senate 
Energy and Natural Resources Committee, have been criticized by 
environmentalists in the past for not doing enough to protect 
wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
	They're winning praise by those groups now for trying to  
increase revenues going to the land and water conservation fund. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I really like is we're going to do something,'' said  
Rindy O'Brien, vice president for policy at The Wilderness Society. 
``You've got all the right people lined up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal also has caught the eye of state officials.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a lot of people paying attention to this,'' said  
Carol Jolly, a policy adviser for Washington Gov. Gary Locke. She 
said the revenues would be useful for salmon restoration and local 
acquisition of land for parks and trails. 
</P>
<P>
	But the bills are drawing fire from private-property groups. By  
mid-February, about 100 groups had formed a new organization called 
the Keep Private Lands in Private Hands Coalition to fight the 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is astounding here is that this is an effort led by some  
Republicans who are going desperately astray,'' said R.J. Smith, 
senior environmental scholar at the Competitive Enterprise 
Institute, a public policy think tank here. 
</P>
<P>
	The opponents say the government already owns too much land,  
especially in the West. Setting aside money for more land purchases 
will infringe on landowners' rights and hurt rural economies, they 
say.

<HEADLINE> GAO Reports Rail Shipper Complaints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Large numbers of rail shippers believe they  
are systematically being overcharged by rail carriers and feel they 
have little recourse from federal regulators, according to 
congressional auditors. 
</P>
<P>
	The General Accounting Office said limited competition in  
certain areas of the country after a series of rail mergers has 
lead shippers to believe they are footing unreasonable costs from 
railroads. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal agency in charge of fielding complaints about rates  
-- the Surface Transportation Board -- has a process that seems too 
complicated and unwieldy for many shippers to undertake, according 
to the GAO report, which was to be released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The process of providing rate relief is so expensive and so  
cumbersome that it is almost unworkable,'' says Sen. Byron Dorgan. 
D-N.D., one of the lawmakers who requested the report. ``When 
shippers are held captive by a monopoly, they don't have an 
effective way to complain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 75 percent of the 700 shippers surveyed by GAO  
auditors said they paying unreasonable rates for rail service. And 
70 percent said the time, complexity and costs in filing complaints 
with the STB are barriers that often preclude them from seeking 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the GAO said, shippers who file a complaint that a  
railroad is using its market dominance to overcharge must create a 
model for the STB, demonstrating how much an optimally efficient 
railroad should charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 72 percent of shippers told the GAO that constructing  
such a model is a difficult task, particularly for small 
businesses. ``The time and cost associated with the model's 
development may outweigh the compensation afforded the shipper 
should the board determine that the challenged rate was 
unreasonable,'' GAO said. 
</P>
<P>
	The auditors tracked the 41 complaints filed with the STB since  
1990 and found that shippers spent about $500,000 to $3 million 
preparing each case. The process can also be timely -- with the STB 
taking anywhere from several months to, in one instance, 16 years 
to resolve a case. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was to be introduced Tuesday as an exhibit in a  
hearing in a Senate subcommittee hearing on reauthorizing the 
Surface Transportation Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorgan said the GAO study will give the surface transportation  
and Merchant Marine subcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee 
``a road map'' in determining what changes are needed at the 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Especially in a period when you have so many railroad mergers,  
you either need effective regulation or a complaint process that is 
simple,'' Dorgan said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate survey, the GAO interviewed the nine major freight  
railroads. All expressed satisfaction with the rate review process 
and said no change in the process is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	The board has implemented some measures to streamline its  
complaint process, the GAO said. For example, it eliminated product 
and geographic competition as criteria for determining market 
dominance by a railroad. It also has implemented guidelines to 
simplify complaints involving smaller dollar amounts. 
</P>
<P>
	A second GAO report analyzing the rates shippers pay freight  
railroads is scheduled for release in April.

<HEADLINE> Guillen Absent From Pirates' Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) -- Right fielder Jose Guillen, not  
guaranteed a starting job despite driving in 154 runs in his first 
two seasons, remained absent from the Pittsburgh Pirates' camp 
Monday for a sixth consecutive day. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as we get him here, the better off he'll be and the  
better off we'll be,'' manager Gene Lamont said. 
</P>
<P>
	Guillen was excused from camp last week after his father died of  
prostate cancer. Guillen and his father were especially close, and 
the Pirates helped arrange for the elder Guillen to leave the 
Dominican Republic and receive medical treatment in Pittsburgh the 
last two summers. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Cam Bonifay issued a short statement Monday that  
suggested the outfielder's absence was not necessarily his fault. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's encountered visa problems,'' Bonifay said. ``We've talked  
with him every day, and we are aware of the situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The day before, Bonifay said he wouldn't necessarily blame a  
visa delay for Guillen's late arrival, but he did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the Pirates begin playing exhibition games on Friday,  
Guillen probably won't be ready for the early games as he works on 
his timing and batting stroke once he finally arrives in Bradenton. 
</P>
<P>
	Guillen normally plays winter baseball in his native Dominican  
Republic, but Lamont said he played only a handful of games this 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
	The 22-year-old Guillen became a starter in the majors at age 20  
and was seen as one of the Pirates' most promising young players in 
years after batting .267 with 28 homers and 154 RBIs in his first 
two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	But Guillen was rumored in trade talks during the off-season,  
and both Bonifay and Lamont said they couldn't guarantee he would 
start this season. Their remarks were seen as an attempt to 
motivate Guillen, who has had lapses in concentration and 
preparation since joining the Pirates in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates also have held on to four starter-caliber  
outfielders -- Guillen, Al Martin, Brian Giles and Brant Brown -- 
even though they might wind up paying Martin $2.7 million to be an 
off-the-bench player. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, first baseman Kevin Young was absent for a fifth  
consecutive day because of pneumonia and probably won't work out 
again until Thursday at the earliest. Young was initially diagnosed 
with the flu. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a major concern right now because it's early,''  
Lamont said. ``You'd be more concerned if it were the middle of 
spring training because he would need time then to get back into 
shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young became ill last week at about the same time he and the  
Pirates were discussing a contract extension. The Pirates offered 
$16 million over three years, while Young wants a four-year deal in 
the $28 million range. 
</P>
<P>
	Also absent Monday were infielder Freddy Garcia and reliever  
Rich Loiselle with the flu. Left-handed reliever Jason Christiansen 
returned after missing three days with the flu.

<HEADLINE> Fire Destroys Golfer Lowery's Home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Fire destroyed the home of pro golfer Steve  
Lowery on Sunday while he competed in the Tucson Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowery's wife, Kathryn, 38, and their three children, ages 1, 3  
and 7, escaped uninjured from the two-story house in the exclusive 
Bay Hill area of suburban Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters rescued a pet dog trapped in rubble inside the  
burning house. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire broke out about 2 p.m., while Lowery was on the course  
at the Tucson National Golf Club. At his wife's request, he wasn't 
told about the fire until he finished his round. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro golfer Scott Hoch, who went to the Lowery home after hearing  
of the blaze, said the family was getting support from the golfing 
community. 
</P>
<P>
	``Several tour players were out there with their wives,'' he  
said. Among them were Arnold and Winnie Palmer, who later in the 
day arranged for the Lowerys to move into a vacant house in Bay 
Hill, Hoch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Winds gusting up to 25 mph quickly pushed the flames through the  
5,000-square-foot home, said Orange County Fire Rescue spokeswoman 
Lt. Tammy Wunderly. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the Lowery children alerted her mother after seeing the  
fire at the rear of the house. Kathryn Lowery ran outside and saw 
fire coming from the area of a light fixture on the exterior of the 
home, Wunderly said. 
</P>
<P>
	She ran to a neighbor's house to call the fire department.  
</P>
<P>
	It took about an hour to bring the fire under control and  
another half-hour to put it out, Wunderly said. She said the house, 
which the Lowerys bought about three years ago for $525,000, was a 
total loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowery, 38, shot a two-under-par round of 70 on Sunday to finish  
the Tuscon Open with a four-round score of 281. He finished five 
shots off the lead, tied for 20th. He won $27,741 in the $2.75 
million tournament.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Man Faces Conspiracy Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A Chinese man arrested in California was the  
second of two men accused of plotting to buy equipment vital to 
missile guidance systems and smuggle it to China, authorities said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Yao Yi tried to buy fiber-optic gyroscopes from an unnamed  
Massachusetts defense contractor, according to a criminal complaint 
filed in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	Yao was arrested at a fiber optics conference in San Diego last  
week and agreed to be brought to Boston to face charges, said 
Despena F. Billings, a federal prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	A second suspect, Collin Xu, was arrested Feb. 11 in Boston. Xu,  
who lives in Montreal, faces charges that include violations of the 
Arms Export Control Act, conspiracy and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	Gyroscopes are used in navigational systems for missiles,  
``smart'' bombs and aircraft guidance systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials say China was bidding to enhance the accuracy  
of its long-range weapons with the high-tech American equipment, 
whose export is rigidly limited by the State Department.

<HEADLINE> Leaking Ship's Bow Moved Toward Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOS BAY, Ore. (AP) -- A tug pulled a broken-off bow section of a  
grounded cargo ship through a sandbar today, covering 550 feet and 
marking the biggest stride yet in the effort to tow it out to sea. 
</P>
<P>
	That brings to more than 650 feet the distance that the section  
of the New Carissa has been moved since crews began trying to 
wrench it free Friday. It's now more than halfway across the 
distance it needs to go to clear two sandbars. 
</P>
<P>
	During Sunday morning's high tide, the 420-foot-long bow section  
was pulled 32 feet in half an hour before it was halted by the 
first of two offshore sandbars. On the late night high tide, 
boosted by heavy storm swells, it was moved an additional 38 feet, 
for a total of 110 feet since the tug began pulling Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ships go when they are ready to go, and this one seems very  
reluctant to go,'' Bill Milwee, salvage consultant to the ship's 
Japanese owners, had said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 620-foot freighter ran aground Feb. 4 when its anchor  
apparently dragged on the sandy bottom while the ship waited out a 
storm to enter Coos Bay for a load of wood chips. 
</P>
<P>
	After four days of pounding by the surf, the ship started  
leaking the heavy oil it carried as fuel for its engines. 
</P>
<P>
	A Navy explosives team set fires that consumed about half the  
oil, but an estimated 70,000 gallons leaked out, fouling beaches 
and birds and working its way into Coos Bay, where it forced 
closure of four commercial oyster farms. 
</P>
<P>
	The day after the explosion, the ship broke in two.  
</P>
<P>
	Crews were unable to burn or pump off the oil remaining in the  
bow section's tanks, so state, federal and private officials 
decided to tow it out to sea and sink it in 9,000 feet of water. 
The stern section, still sitting close to shore, is not believed to 
present any more threat of oil leakage. 
</P>
<P>
	No new oil has been seen in the water since the towing began,  
said Mike Szerlog of the Oregon Department of Environmental 
Quality.

<HEADLINE> Reading on Clinton Vacation Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARK CITY, Utah (AP) -- While Hillary Rodham Clinton and daughter  
Chelsea enjoy the sun and ski slopes, President Clinton is settling 
into a little quiet time at the gated multimillion-dollar estate of 
a Hollywood friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suspect he's doing exactly what he said he was (going to  
do), which is reading,'' said spokesman Barry Toiv. ``Work is low 
on the totem pole today as far as his priorities. He's on 
vacation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton told reporters en route to Park City from a fund-raising  
visit to Los Angeles that he was looking forward to a long weekend 
of reading with no bigger plans than perhaps a trip into town for 
coffee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons had a private dinner and a birthday cake Saturday  
night for Chelsea as she turned 19. It was the second straight year 
they have celebrated her birthday here. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady and Chelsea were spotted on the slopes Sunday by  
photographers and cameramen. Mrs. Clinton was overheard expressing 
irritation to Secret Service agents about someone who had skied too 
close to her. 
</P>
<P>
	As they did last year, the Clintons are staying at the home of  
Hollywood producer Jeffrey Katzenberg, who lent them his his estate 
in the Deer Valley Resort. Katzenberg has several intermediate ski 
runs just off his backyard. 
</P>
<P>
	The first family arrived here Saturday and will stay until  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton does not ski. He tried it once 15 years ago in Sun  
Valley, Idaho, where he took repeated tumbles and finished the day 
with torn ligaments in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Toiv said Clinton gets a national security report every day  
except Sunday, but that a national security official was on standby 
here if needed to brief him. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the president strolled Park City's Main Street,  
shaking hands and visiting the historic jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenberg, co-partner with Steven Spielberg and David Geffen in  
DreamWorks SKG, is a big campaign donor to Clinton and other 
Democrats. The former Walt Disney Co. studio chief is a frequent 
guest at the White House and Clinton has stayed at his Malibu, 
Calif., home.

<HEADLINE> Panthers Acquire Lewis as Backup QB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE (AP) -- The Carolina Panthers acquired quarterback Jeff  
Lewis Monday from the Denver Broncos for undisclosed draft picks in 
1999 and 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis, 25, was Denver's fourth-round pick in the 1996 draft out  
of Division I-AA Northern Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-2, 211-pound Lewis did not play in 1998 after  
suffering a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee while 
playing in an offseason pickup basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Lewis was the Broncos' second-string quarterback for  
the first 13 games and was moved to third-string when Denver 
acquired Bubby Brister. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jeff's schooling during the early stages of his career has  
been in a similar offensive system and this is a plus,'' said 
Panthers coach George Seifert. ``His mobility and desire to compete 
is a plus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seifert said Steve Beuerlein will still be the Panthers'  
starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Going into training camp, Steve Beuerlein is our quarterback  
and we have a great deal of respect for his ability and what he has 
accomplished,'' Seifert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis has played in five NFL games with no starts, completing 10  
of 19 passes with no touchdowns and one interception.

<HEADLINE> Yankee Stadium Name May Be for Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Budweiser Yankee Stadium?  
</P>
<P>
	Or maybe Yahoo! Yankee Stadium?  
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees, in the process of merging their business operations  
with the New Jersey Nets, may be willing -- for a price -- to change 
the name of the House that Ruth Built. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sooner or later, they will be interested in it,'' said Howard  
Rubenstein, the spokesman for YankeeNets. ``But they will probably 
will want to determine where they want to place a new Yankee 
Stadium, and then they'll deal with all the ancillary issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees' lease to play in Yankee Stadium expires in three  
years, and the team has talked about three options: rebuilding the 
current ballpark, which opened in 1923 and was extensively 
remodeled from 1974-76; constructing a new ballpark near Madison 
Square Garden on the West Side of Manhattan; or constructing a new 
ballpark in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees owner George Steinbrenner expects New York City or New  
Jersey state and/or municipal governments pay for most of the 
construction, but no financing has appeared and the team hasn't 
committed to any plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubenstein thinks the ``Yankee'' will remain in Yankee Stadium  
no matter what, even if there's an addition. He doesn't expect the 
name to meet the fate of the Nets' home court, which started out at 
Brendan T. Byrne Arena and become Continental Airlines Arena in 
1996 after the company agreed to pay $29 million over 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``They would consider naming rights, but I doubt very much they  
would eliminate the name Yankee Stadium,'' Rubenstein said. ``If 
anything, they would attach to the name Yankee Stadium. It would be 
to the corporation's advantage to attach onto the Yankee name 
rather than do what happened in New Jersey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees and Nets have a memorandum of understanding about  
the merger, but must still negotiate a complete agreement -- never 
an easy task when Steinbrenner is involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``Issues such as naming rights and joint promotions, marketing  
issues and signage are being discussed now,'' Rubenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Yankee Stadium is owned by New York City, Mayor Rudolph  
Giuliani has said he expected naming rights to be part of any 
development of redevelopment package. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last few years, Cinergy (Cincinnati), Edison  
International (Anaheim), Qualcomm (San Diego), Pro Player 
(Florida), 3Com (San Francisco) and Tropicana (Tampa Bay) have 
signed deals to gets their names on major league ballparks, and 
Bank One (Arizona) and Coors (Denver) attached their names to new 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Between now and 2001, ballparks with corporate names will open  
in Detroit (Comerica), Milwaukee (Miller), Pittsburgh (PNC), San 
Francisco (Pacific Bell) and Seattle (Safeco). 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner has been aggressive with his marketing deals,  
agreeing two years ago to a $95 million, 10-year contract with 
Adidas even though parts of it conflicted with baseball's national 
marketing deals. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Yankees and Adidas sued baseball in May 1997, the  
case was resolved a year later, with the sporting goods company 
signing a national agreement with Major League Baseball Properties.

<HEADLINE> HUD Advises on Mortgage Broker Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeking to save Americans millions of dollars  
a year in excess fees for mortgage brokers, the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development issued a statement Monday clarifying 
what the agency believes brokers should charge. 
</P>
<P>
	The policy statement doesn't carry the force of law, and HUD  
said it believed new legislation was needed to resolve legal 
uncertainties. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement says that mortgage brokers must provide real goods  
or services and the fees they receive from lenders and borrowers 
must be ``reasonably related'' to the value of the goods or 
services. It also advises consumers that higher interest rates 
alone don't justify higher payments to mortgage brokers and urges 
the brokers to improve their disclosures to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mortgage brokers have a right to be reasonably compensated for  
the services they provide,'' HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo said in a 
statement. ``They don't have a right to collect illegal kickbacks 
and referral fees from lenders, and we will continue enforcing the 
law against these abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	``American families shouldn't be overcharged for mortgage  
services and should have the clear, easily understood information 
they need to shop around for the best deal when they select a 
mortgage broker,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kickbacks, referral fees and other unearned fees are prohibited  
by federal law. Fees to mortgage brokers from lenders and borrowers 
must be clearly disclosed to consumers in the ``good faith 
estimate,'' provided no later than three days after the consumer's 
loan application, and on the consumer's settlement statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 6 million American households paid fees to mortgage brokers  
last year in an effort to find the best interest rate and other 
terms on their mortgages, according to HUD. Brokers were involved 
in about half of all mortgage loans, worth some $730 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers' fees generally run from $1,000 to $3,000 per loan.  
Services they provide include filling out applications, ordering 
reports and documents, advising borrowers and participating in loan 
closings. 
</P>
<P>
	Some mortgage brokers only represent the borrower in shopping  
for a loan while others offer loans themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The policy statement is available on HUD's Web site at

<HEADLINE> McGwire Will Miss Spring Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUPITER, Fla. (AP) -- Mark McGwire will not be in the lineup when  
the St. Louis Cardinals open their spring schedule Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who set a major league record with 70 home runs last  
season, won't make the 90-minute bus ride to Vero Beach, Fla., for 
the exhibition game against the Los Angeles Dodgers but intends to 
play in home games at Jupiter on Saturday, Sunday and Monday, 
Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals play the Montreal Expos in the weekend games, and  
the Houston Astros on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``McGwire will probably get two at-bats in the early games,  
maybe three if the game moves quickly,'' La Russa said. ``He 
prefers it that way, too, rather than have four or five at-bats one 
day and then take a day off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shortstop Edgar Renteria, acquired in a trade with the Florida  
Marlins Dec. 7, is still nursing a right knee sprain and bone 
bruise from last year and is being held out of action as a 
precautionary measure. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just being patient with Renteria,'' trainer Barry  
Weinberg said. ``The main thing is for him to be ready when the 
regular season opens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Renteria is working out regularly but has the knee iced down  
each day after practice.

<HEADLINE> GEC Buys Reltec for $2 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- British engineering group General Electric Co.  
is buying Cleveland-based telecommunications equipment maker Reltec 
Corp. for $2.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition will give London-based GEC, a high-technology  
company focused on defense electronics and communications, greater 
distribution channels in North America. GEC is not related to 
General Electric Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Both of the companies' board of directors have approved the  
merger, which is still subject to federal approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Reltec is a leader in the design, manufacture and sale of  
telecommunication network products and employs about 6,600 
employees worldwide. The company's key U.S. customers include 
Ameritech, AT&AMP;T, Bell Atlantic, BellSouth, GTE, Sprint, US West and 
WorldCom MCI. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, GEC announced an agreement to separate and merge its  
defense electronics business with British Aerospace.

<HEADLINE> New breed of Bike Messengers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- David Dungan dashes through midday traffic,  
changing lanes and blowing through red lights at almost 35 mph. A 
bicycle messenger, he does this five days a week in sun, wind, snow 
and rain. 
</P>
<P>
	And he does it all on a bike with neither gears nor brakes.  
</P>
<P>
	Dungan is one of a growing cadre of so-called ``groovy'' riders  
who have stormed onto the bike messenger scene everywhere from 
midtown Manhattan to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	They ride ``track bikes,'' which are light, fast and  
increasingly evident in cold weather cities like Chicago, Boston 
and New York where subzero temperatures can freeze brakes and snap 
cables. 
</P>
<P>
	But are they a good idea on the street, crowded with cars and  
pedestrians? 
</P>
<P>
	``My first month, I must have run into a dozen things,'' the  
23-year-old Dungan said. ``But right now, I'd feel uncomfortable 
riding anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really taking off,'' says Erek Hancock, a six-year  
veteran of the Boston-based Quicksilver Messenger Service, Inc., 
who estimates half of the riders in Boston now use track bikes, 
compared with about 20 percent five years ago. ``It's the cool 
thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Track bikes have a shorter wheel base than ordinary bikes for  
making tight turns and use a fixed gear instead of a derailleur. 
The pedals move when a bike moves, forward or backward, and the 
only way to slow a track bike down is to pedal slower. A good rider 
can stop pedaling altogether, sending the bike into a kind of 
controlled skid. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why track bikes are so cool,'' Dungan said. ``You can  
slide and turn at the same time. I can switch three lanes while I'm 
sliding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bikes were originally built for a velodrome, an oval track  
with steeply banked turns that features high speeds and crowded 
fields, according to Dale Hughes of the Walden School of Cycling in 
Rochester, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes said the brakes were removed from track bikes long ago  
for safety reasons. ``You've got 30 guys all elbow-to-elbow going 
30 mph and nobody can stop in front of you'' because nobody has 
brakes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes insists track bikes are also safe on city streets. He  
argues that because messengers know they can't stop fast, they're 
more likely to choose a route that doesn't get them into trouble, 
steering clear of cars and people that could slow them down. 
</P>
<P>
	Track bikes, he said, are becoming more popular all around. But  
he suggests it's taking root among bike messengers specifically 
because of the risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's more of a cavalier attitude, the Pony Express `get there  
at all costs' sort of thing,'' he said. ``I am sure it's a big rush 
to be going quick through traffic and you've got to make a quick 
decision, like, where's my escape route? You're on the edge out 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By their nature, bike messengers are independent types. No  
national group keeps records on what kind of bike each messenger 
rides. But a movement in Boston is trying to bring some order to 
the business. 
</P>
<P>
	The city took action in July following an accident in which a  
62-year-old Federal Reserve Bank vice president fell into a coma 
after being hit by a bike messenger. A city licensing system for 
messengers took effect Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Riders in Boston must now carry picture identification and  
license plates behind their seats and have personal liability 
insurance. The idea is to create accountability, according to 
Boston Police Lt. James Curran. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not trying to knock them out of business,'' he said.  
``We're trying to bring them into compliance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Track bikes are something we're going to have to look into,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	There's another benefit for track bike riders. Nelson George, a  
two-year messenger veteran in Boston with Quicksilver, says his 
bike gets stolen at least once every six months. But the thieves 
never get far. 
</P>
<P>
	``They only get about two blocks before they crash because they  
don't know how to ride it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Personal Income Rises in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' personal incomes increased a robust  
0.6 percent in January and their spending rose moderately, 
reflecting a strong start for the economy in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase, following a flukey 0.1 percent decline in  
December, the first in five years, suggests Americans will have the 
wherewithal to power the economic expansion briskly past its eighth 
anniversary in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Personal spending in January rose 0.3 percent following a 0.7  
percent surge in December, the strongest in seven months, the 
Commerce Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the department said the strongest burst of highway  
and street building in 24 years powered a 1.6 percent increase in 
construction spending in January, the most in seven months. 
</P>
<P>
	The income figures, particularly December's, were influenced by  
a number of special factors. These included a decline in farm 
subsidy payments in December following one-time payments in 
November and cost-of-living increases in January for Social 
Security recipients and federal employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding the special factors, incomes grew solidly in both  
months: 0.3 percent in December and 0.5 percent in January. That 
suggests that any slowdown from the startling October-December 
economic growth rate of 6.1 percent won't be too precipitous. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact that Americans' incomes increased faster than their  
spending in January helped them record a positive savings rate for 
only the second time in five months. 
</P>
<P>
	It was 0.1 percent in January, minus 0.3 percent in December and  
0.6 percent in November, the month when farmers collected the big 
subsidy payment. 
</P>
<P>
	The savings rate has sunk to levels last seen on a sustained  
basis during the Depression because some Americans have been 
spending money from their accumulated wealth -- stock-market gains, 
home equity -- as opposed to current income. 
</P>
<P>
	The key component of income -- wages and salaries -- rose 0.7  
percent in January after increasing 0.4 percent the month before. 
Government incomes jumped 1.2 percent, reflecting the 
cost-of-living increases. Income in services advanced 0.8 percent 
while manufacturing incomes -- hard hit of late by declines in 
export sales -- rose a modest 0.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Transfer payments such as Social Security also rose, as did  
rental income as did business owners' income, rental income and 
dividends. Personal interest income fell. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending during the month was led by a 0.8 percent increase in  
services, followed by a 0.3 percent rise in purchases of nondurable 
goods such as food and fuel, paper products and chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending on durable goods plunged 2.1 percent following a 3.3  
percent surge in December, reflecting the pattern of auto buying. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction was led by a 5.9 percent jump in government  
spending, the most in eight years, fueled by a 25.7 surge for 
highways and streets. Residential construction increased 1.3 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	However, commercial construction fell 1.1 percent, pulled down  
by drops at factories and other industrial facilities and at 
shopping centers.

<HEADLINE> French, Italian Firms in Iran Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Elf Aquitaine of France and Agip of Italy  
signed a $540 million energy deal with Iran on Monday to boost oil 
production despite U.S. sanctions on investments in the Islamic 
Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal with the state-run National Iranian Oil Co. for the  
Dorood oil and gas field is expected to increase Iran's output 
capacity, the European consortium said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Iran's now produces nearly 4 million barrels of oil a day. The  
Dorood deal is expected to boost that amount by more than 100,000 
barrels daily. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has strongly discouraged such investment in a  
nation it describes as a sponsor of terrorism. The U.S. Congress 
has passed the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, threatening to punish 
companies investing more than $20 million in Iran or $40 million in 
Libya. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the French oil company Total signed a $2 billion deal  
with Iran to develop natural gas reserves, along with Gazprom, a 
Russian petroleum company, and Petronas, a Malaysian company. The 
United States said the following year that it would waive sanctions 
in that case.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Jobless Rate at Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's unemployment stood at an all-time high of  
4.4 percent in January for the third straight month, as a record 
number of people lost jobs due to corporate restructuring and 
bankruptcies, the government announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of people seeking work after being forced out of  
their jobs rose by 340,000 in January from a year earlier to 1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the highest number since the government began compiling  
the data in the current form in 1984, the statistics bureau of the 
Management and Coordination Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The total number of jobless in January was 2.98 million, up by a  
record 600,000 from the year-earlier month, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the number of people out of work after voluntarily  
departing from their previous jobs rose by 180,000 to 1.07 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency had originally reported December's jobless rate at  
4.3 percent but revised it upward to 4.4 percent -- the same as 
November. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, the agency announced that Japan's jobless rate for  
all of 1998 averaged 4.1 percent -- the highest figure for a single 
year since records began to be kept in the present form in 1953.

<HEADLINE> Man Linked to Missouri Rapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A nationwide manhunt for a suspect dubbed the  
``South Side Rapist'' after more than two dozen rapes in eastern 
Missouri has apparently ended in the parking lot of a New Mexico 
motel. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis N. Rabbitt, 42, was arrested Sunday morning by  
Albuquerque police outside the Freeway Inn on the city's east side 
after a short foot chase, said Albuquerque police spokesman Capt. 
Carl Ross. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbitt had apparently been living at the hotel since  
mid-November and gave officers a false name but his real social 
security number. 
</P>
<P>
	There hadn't been any confirmed sightings of Rabbitt since he  
was spotted at a Missouri Tigers football game in Columbia, Mo., 
last November. 
</P>
<P>
	Police stumbled on his trail after the mother of a 15-year-old  
former runaway found Rabbitt's phone and hotel room numbers in her 
daughter's room. 
</P>
<P>
	When police arrived at the hotel and asked him for his name,  
Rabbitt told them he was Nathan Babbitt. A quick check of his name 
revealed nothing so police asked him for his social security 
number. 
</P>
<P>
	He rattled off his own.  
</P>
<P>
	Police then discovered the 40 rape charges involving 11 rapes  
against him in St. Louis. Charges also are filed against him in St. 
Louis, Jefferson and St. Charles counties. 
</P>
<P>
	Two St. Louis detectives on Sunday flew to Albuquerque to try  
and interview Rabbitt. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very, very, certain that indeed Dennis Rabbitt, the  
South Side Rapist, is in custody,'' St. Louis Police Chief Ron 
Henderson said. ``Now we can take it to the next level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Henderson nor FBI Agent Wiley D. Thompson would say when  
Rabbitt would be extradited to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	``At some point, we're going to get him. Whether we get him  
first or whatever, we've got 40 warrants on him,'' Henderson said. 
``He's hurt a lot of people. Hopefully the night we put this thing 
to rest, people will sleep a lot better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hunt for Rabbitt began in November. Rabbitt had quit his job  
at a waste disposal company and disappeared after police 
investigating a Peeping Tom obtained a sample of his saliva. 
</P>
<P>
	A week later, DNA results allegedly linked Rabbitt to assaults  
by the South Side Rapist, who had terrorized local women since 
Sept. 12, 1988, police said.

<HEADLINE> Quake Survivors Arrive in N.Y. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Twelve-year-old Jenny Amaya burst into tears as  
she reunited with her father after surviving a harrowing ordeal 
which maimed her and claimed her mother's life. 
</P>
<P>
	Jenny, who lost her mother and part of her leg in the Colombia  
earthquake that killed more than 1,170 people, embraced Emilio 
Amaya in a teary reunion Sunday at LaGuardia International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thank God for bringing my family here,'' Amaya said in  
Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to hug and kiss them and tell them that I really love  
them,'' he said through an interpreter just before the girls 
arrived. He brought two warm winter coats to the airport for them. 
</P>
<P>
	When they arrived, Jenny and her 13-year-old sister, Maritza,  
sobbed and hugged their father, a textile factory worker, who came 
to the United States in 1985 but sent his wife and children back to 
their hometown of Pereira in Colombia six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Jenny was badly injured in the Jan. 25 earthquake, and is  
believed to be the only U.S. citizen hurt in the disaster that left 
some 250,000 people homeless. She was surrounded by stuffed animals 
as she left the airplane in a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jenny's birthday was last week, so we plan to celebrate,''  
said her father. She is to receive medical treatment -- including a 
prosthesis for her damaged leg -- at Elmhurst and Mount Sinai 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Rep. Nydia Velazquez, D-Brooklyn, who traveled with the  
girls, said they were anxious to see their father. ``When we were 
about to land the girls were saying 'We are going to see Daddy, we 
are going to see Daddy!''' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jenny and Maritza's mother, Luz Dary, was at a bank cashing a  
check from Amaya when she died. The earthquake sent a wall tumbling 
on top of her and Jenny. Maritza was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Amaya, 43, had been sending money to support them and was  
devastated by the news of his wife's death. But he was unable to 
fly back to get the girls because he is an undocumented immigrant 
who would likely have trouble reentering the United States if he 
leaves.

<HEADLINE> Group Urges No Cursing in Sports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Trash talk is as familiar to basketball  
fans as slam dunks. On the sidelines of NFL games, profanity is as 
much a fixture as Gatorade. 
</P>
<P>
	But it doesn't stop there. High school athletes -- and even those  
younger -- are cursing during games. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday is National Sportsmanship Day, and the group organizing  
the event wants to do something about all the crude talk. It is 
campaigning for players and coaches at about 12,000 schools in 101 
nations to pledge not to curse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a pretty big deal because most players do swear  
on the court and it just takes away from the game ... the 
enjoyment, the excitement,'' said Reginald Williams, a 17-year-old 
from North Carolina who plays basketball for the American Community 
School in Cobham, England. 
</P>
<P>
	The Institute for International Sport, a nonprofit group that  
promotes ethics and international friendship through sports, got 
the idea for the ``No Swear Zone'' pledge after doing a survey of 
top business and political leaders, said executive director Dan 
Doyle. 
</P>
<P>
	One Fortune 500 CEO called profanity in sports a major  
self-control problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no such thing as trash talking in corporate board  
rooms,'' he said in response to the survey, choosing to remain 
anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers from the institute, which is based in South  
Kingstown, R.I., concede they do not know whether profanity is in 
sports is on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
	One coach said profanity is not a factor of class, nationality  
or religion. Rather, she said, the popular culture reinforces the 
foul language. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the television they watch. It's the culture,'' said  
Barbara Hoegen, who coaches Williams and other varsity basketball 
players for the American Community School in Cobham. 
</P>
<P>
	The school attracts the children of well-paid expatriate  
professionals and business executives from around the world to its 
campus 30 minutes outside of London. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are from good families. We call it milk and honey land,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle concedes that pledging to not curse will do little to  
change the behavior, which often comes in uncontrolled outbursts. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who Hoegen says curses a lot, agrees. In the margin of  
the no-profanity pledge sheet, he noted that he would only ``try'' 
not to swear. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very passionate about basketball. If something goes wrong,  
I can't really say to my coach that I am not going to say something 
bad,'' Williams said. ``But I would definitely try to live up to my 
word,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle hopes a series of role-playing activities and discussion  
topics suggested to schools for National Sportsmanship Day will 
help change attitudes more than the pledge itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't do any good for someone to come up before a game  
and read the sportsmanship code,'' he said. ``What does good is for 
teams to really sit down and decide where they stand.''

<HEADLINE> Personal Income Rises in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A rebound at factories and strong growth in  
Americans' incomes indicate the economy will continue to grow 
robustly as it enters its ninth straight year of expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have is an economy where the weak link is  
strengthening,'' said economist Tim O'Neill of Bank of Montreal in 
Toronto. ``That suggests for another year, another several quarters 
at least, growth will come in above forecast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reports issued Monday show:  
</P>
<P>
	--Manufacturing activity surged higher in February, ending an  
eight-month decline. 
</P>
<P>
	--Personal incomes increased a brisk 0.6 percent in January and  
spending a moderate 0.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--The strongest burst of highway and street building in 24 years  
helped power a 1.6 percent increase in construction spending in 
January, the most in seven months. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. economic expansion starts its ninth year later this  
month. Already the longest during peacetime, the expansion almost 
certainly will continue into next year, surpassing the 1961-69 run 
during the Vietnam War, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, if the growth rate stays close to last year's 3.9  
percent, Federal Reserve policy-makers might cool demand and keep 
inflation low by raising short-term interest rates during the 
second half of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect the economy to slow on its own but, if I'm wrong,  
then there will be higher interest rates this year,'' predicted 
economist Nicholas Perna of Fleet Financial Group in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Long-term interest rates in the bond market already are rising  
in anticipation. Stock prices wavered in response. After losing 
more than 83 points in the morning, the Dow Jones average of 
industrial stocks closed up 18 points at 9,325. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's manufacturing report, from the National Association of  
Purchasing Management, showed both production and orders for new 
business improved significantly last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``The manufacturing sector has bottomed out and has likely  
experienced the worst effects of the turmoil overseas,'' said 
economist Marilyn Schaja of Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	The key component of income -- wages and salaries -- rose 0.7  
percent in January, reflecting federal cost-of-living increases. 
Income in services advanced strongly but, in manufacturing, only 
modestly. 
</P>
<P>
	January's increase in consumer spending was led by a 0.8 percent  
rise in services, followed by a 0.3 percent gain in purchases of 
nondurable goods such as food and fuel. Spending on durable goods 
plunged 2.1 percent following a 3.3 percent surge in December, 
reflecting the pattern of auto buying. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact that incomes increased faster than their spending in  
January helped produce a positive U.S. savings rate for only the 
second time in five months. It was 0.1 percent in January, minus 
0.3 percent in December and 0.6 percent in November, the month when 
farmers collected the big subsidy payment. 
</P>
<P>
	The savings rate has sunk to levels last seen on a sustained  
basis during the Depression because some Americans have been 
spending money from their accumulated wealth -- stock-market gains, 
home equity -- as opposed to current income. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction was led by a 5.9 percent jump in government  
spending, the most in eight years, fueled by a 25.7 surge for 
highways and streets. 
</P>
<P>
	According to economist Lynn Reaser of Nationsbank Corp. in  
Jacksonville, Fla., local and state governments are spending 
surpluses on road building. 
</P>
<P>
	Residential construction increased 1.3 percent. However,  
commercial construction fell 1.1 percent, pulled down by drops at 
factories, other industrial facilities and at shopping centers.

<HEADLINE> GOP Senator Urges Stand on Abortion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Republican activists have ended a  
state party convention that featured a leadership fight centered on 
the candidates' abortion stances. Now, they are ready to return to 
their real business -- defeating Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``Compared to the differences between us and the Democrats, the  
differences between one Republican and another are minor,'' 
convention delegate Adam Fogerson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP's dislike for President Clinton emerged as a unifying  
factor at the semiannual weekend gathering that featured 
appearances by seven White House hopefuls. It was a reflection of 
the new clout in presidential politics that comes with California's 
earlier-than-ever primary next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire and former Vice President Dan  
Quayle both drew standing ovations when they praised the House 
trial managers who fought to remove Clinton from office following 
his impeachment. Smith said the president ``behaves like an 
animal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While all seven GOP aspirants oppose abortion, their political  
handling of the issue mirrored the split in the party. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith made a fire-and-brimstone presentation of his  
anti-abortion stance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Killing children is the central issue facing our nation today,  
and it needs to be stopped,'' he said. ``If we're not going to 
stand up for the life of unborn children, maybe the Republican 
Party deserves to fall into the ash bin of history ... and it will, 
if we don't stand up for life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others, like former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, echoed those  
who called for the party to emphasize less-divisive issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of laying down litmus tests and rigid pronouncements,  
reach out to others with whom we agree,'' he urged convention 
attendees. 
</P>
<P>
	The California GOP suffered devastating losses in November's  
election, with just two Republicans holding statewide offices. That 
upped the ante for pulling the party together at the convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Schnur, a GOP consultant, said he came in bracing for a  
``circular firing squad'' but witnessed merely ``a water balloon 
fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This party did what you're supposed to do when you're looking  
to get back on track -- it argued its differences and put them aside 
and moved on,'' he said. ``We're not going to solve them at a 
convention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether or not the party emerges from its convention truly  
unified remains to be seen, but Republicans were clearly happy to 
get past the battle for the state party chairmanship. 
</P>
<P>
	The victor, former party Vice Chairman John McGraw, has said  
banning abortion is his No. 1 mission; his opponent, Nicholas 
Bavaro, said he would have focused on other issues. McGraw won 
decisively. 
</P>
<P>
	He preached harmony in his victory speech, and sought to rally  
the Republicans around the cause of beating Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want this to be the party of open and honest debate,'' he  
told the delegates. ``But when that is done, I want us to unite and 
go after the Democrats.''

<HEADLINE>  Cepeda, Maz Hope Hall Calls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Orlando Cepeda earned his reputation with a bat.  
Bill Mazeroski was known for his Gold Glove -- and one big swing. 
</P>
<P>
	In their own ways, both players put up impressive numbers during  
17-year careers. On Tuesday, they'll find out whether those add up 
to a place in the Hall of Fame, although only one of them can be 
elected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm beginning to get very nervous,'' Cepeda said last week  
from his California home. ``I've been waiting so long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former outfielder Dom DiMaggio, manager Dick Williams and  
umpires Doug Harvey and Nestor Chylak also will be considered when 
the Veterans Committee holds its annual election in Tampa, Fla. 
Results are to be announced at 2 p.m. EST. 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Williams, Stan Musial and Yogi Berra are on the panel, down  
to 12 members this year from its normal 15. It will take 75 percent 
-- nine votes -- for election. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vets can pick up to four new Hall of Famers, one from each  
of four categories. The categories are: former major leaguers, 
Negro leaguers, 19th century players and personnel, plus a 
composite of managers, umpires, executives and Negro leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
	Turn-of-the-century manager Frank Selee and Negro leagues stars  
Smokey Joe Williams, Biz Mackey and Turkey Stearnes each attracted 
attention in last year's vote. The committee chose Larry Doby, Lee 
MacPhail, ``Bullet'' Joe Rogan and ``Gorgeous'' George Davis last 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	Induction ceremonies will be held July 25 at Cooperstown, N.Y.  
Nolan Ryan, George Brett and Robin Yount were elected in January by 
the Baseball Writers' Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda was the NL's rookie of the year in 1958 with San  
Francisco and the league's first unanimous MVP in 1967 with St. 
Louis. Nicknamed the Baby Bull and Cha-Cha, he hit .297 with 379 
home runs and 1,365 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda, 61, missed by just seven votes in the BBWAA election  
five years ago, his final try with the writers. He came close last 
year in voting by the Veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope this time I make it,'' said Cepeda, a community  
relations representative for the Giants. ``It would be the highest 
thing. It's hard to describe how much it would mean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mazeroski batted just .260 with 138 homers and 853 RBIs for  
Pittsburgh, but hit one of the most famous home runs ever -- a 
bottom-of-the-ninth shot in Game 7 of the 1960 World Series to beat 
the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazeroski made his mark in the field, winning eight Gold Gloves  
and taking part in 1,706 double plays, most in history among major 
league second basemen. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they consider defense, I got a chance,'' said Mazeroski,  
now 62 and working for the Pirates as a spring training instructor. 
``But if they don't, I don't have a chance at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio, at 82 the younger brother of Joe, hit .298 in 11  
seasons for the Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda, Mazeroski and DiMaggio all have strong supporters on the  
panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda is endorsed by former Giants teammate Juan Marichal and  
Mazeroski is boosted his former Pirates general manager, committee 
chairman Joe Brown. DiMaggio is supported by Ted Williams, his 
fellow outfielder on the Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	The Veterans panel is down to 12 because of the retirement of  
longtime executive Buzzie Bavasi and the health of writer Leonard 
Koppett and Hall of Fame shortstop Pee Wee Reese. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda did not get much support from the BBWAA when he first  
appeared on the ballot in 1978. Many felt his airport arrest on 
charges of trying to pick up 160 pounds of marijuana in 1975 -- for 
which he was sentenced to five years in jail and served 10 months -- 
hurt his bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe what happened to me in the past is all forgotten,''  
Cepeda said. 
</P>
<P>
	His son, an Adidas representative who was at the Yankees' spring  
training camp in Tampa last week, hopes this will be Cepeda's lucky 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``At one time, through my dad's trouble, it gets to the point  
like, `I don't want to hear it, I'm tired of baseball,''' said 
31-year-old Orlando Jr. ``As my dad has been getting older and 
getting more involved in baseball, it's a more special time now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Williams, a special adviser to the Yankees, has gotten  
support in the past. He was 1,571-1,451 (.520) with Boston, 
Oakland, California, Montreal, San Diego and Seattle and went to 
four World Series, winning two of them.

<HEADLINE> Spider-Man Can Now Appear in Films </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- For years, there was only one foe Spider-Man  
couldn't defeat: lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	But now the comic book superhero's long legal struggle is over  
and his movie career is set to begin. Publisher Marvel Enterprises 
Inc. and Sony Pictures Entertainment have settled their tangled web 
of lawsuits that have kept the super hero off the big screen for 
more then a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great day for us,'' Marvel Enterprises president and  
chief executive Eric Ellenbogen said. ``The last vestiges of 
bankruptcy and previous entanglements are now gone. The company is 
totally freed. And its most important property is now going to 
become a major motion picture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, which settles lawsuits over ownership of film  
rights to the character and was signed on the eve of trial, Marvel 
and Sony agreed to launch a Spider-Man franchise, with Sony 
producing the movie. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement disclosed Monday was a major boost for  
Spider-Man's publishing home, Marvel Enterprises, which was formed 
last October after Marvel Entertainment Group emerged from 
bankruptcy and combined with Toy Biz Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no announcement on when a movie project would begin,  
though Spider-Man had been among the most prized characters never 
to be put on film. 
</P>
<P>
	``We couldn't be happier -- at long last -- to bring this popular  
character to the big screen to the delight of audience around the 
world,'' said Amy Pascal, president of Sony's Columbia Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spider-Man character was created by famed Marvel comic book  
artist Stan Lee in 1962, entering the world as ``The Amazing 
Spider-Man.'' Spider-Man is really teen-ager Peter Parker, who got 
his powers when bitten by a radioactive spider. 
</P>
<P>
	Spider-Man comics have been huge sellers, and the hero has been  
the basis of a newspaper comic strip and animated and live-action 
TV series, but never a feature film. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, studios have been eager to make a Spider-Man movie to  
share in some of the success of the Batman and Superman films. At 
one point, ``Titanic'' director James Cameron had been recruited to 
write and direct a Spider-Man film. 
</P>
<P>
	But Spider-Man has been kept off the screen because of more than  
a decade of business problems, including bankruptcies of at least 
three companies linked to the character, and competing claims in 
court to the rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The years of lawsuits and counter-lawsuits now before Superior  
Court Judge Aurelio Munoz have generated 60 boxes of court 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement resolves competing lawsuits by Marvel and Sony.  
It also settles claims by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which had contended 
it had acquired the rights from a number of now-defunct film 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, MGM suffered a setback when a judge rejected those  
claims. MGM had said it would appeal. An MGM spokesman declined to 
comment other than to confirm MGM had resolved its disputes in the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement doesn't affect claims by yet another litigant,  
Viacom Inc., which are still scheduled for trial this week. Viacom 
contends it holds the television distribution rights to any 
Spider-Man movie. Viacom officials didn't return a message seeking 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, another battle between Sony and MGM continues over  
another famous character. 
</P>
<P>
	A trial is set for next month over the rights to the lucrative  
James Bond movie franchise. Last week, a federal judge rejected 
MGM's motion for summary judgment in the fight with Sony. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond movies are about the only moneymakers for the struggling  
MGM, which plans to release the latest installment of the Bond 
series -- No. 19 -- in November with Pierce Brosnan again as 007.

<HEADLINE> Clintons End Vacation a Day Early </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARK CITY, Utah (AP) -- President and Mrs. Clinton today cut  
short a Utah vacation to return to Washington and get home a day 
early from a ski outing with their daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Barry Toiv said there was no emergency or  
urgent reason for Clinton to return. ``They just decided they would 
leave today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before departing, Clinton walked down a main street in Park City  
to get coffee at the Main Street Deli. He was dressed in a leather 
jacket, blue jeans and sneakers. Asked what he thought about the 
Salt Lake City Olympics in 2002, he said: ``I'm looking forward to 
it. I think Salt Lake will de a great job with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton arrived here on Saturday to join his wife Hillary and  
daughter Chelsea for a ski weekend. The first lady and her daughter 
skied on Sunday; the president is not a skier. 
</P>
<P>
	Chelsea, who turned 19 on Saturday, was to have returned to  
Stanford University today; the president and his wife were to have 
remained until Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressed on why the Clintons were leaving, Toiv said ``They have  
a full schedule the rest of the week'' and decided to ``get home a 
day early.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons spent the weekend at the gated multimillion-dollar  
estate of a Hollywood friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton told reporters en route to Park City from a fund-raising  
visit to Los Angeles that he was looking forward to a long weekend 
of reading with no bigger plans than perhaps a trip into town for 
coffee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons had a private dinner and a birthday cake Saturday  
night for Chelsea as she turned 19. It was the second straight year 
they have celebrated her birthday here. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady and Chelsea were spotted on the slopes Sunday by  
photographers and cameramen. Mrs. Clinton was overheard expressing 
irritation to Secret Service agents about someone who had skied too 
close to her. 
</P>
<P>
	As they did last year, the Clintons are staying at the home of  
Hollywood producer Jeffrey Katzenberg, who lent them his estate in 
the Deer Valley Resort. Katzenberg has several intermediate ski 
runs just off his backyard. 
</P>
<P>
	The first family arrived here Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton does not ski. He tried it once 15 years ago in Sun  
Valley, Idaho, where he took repeated tumbles and finished the day 
with torn ligaments in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Toiv said Clinton gets a national security report every day  
except Sunday, but that a national security official was on standby 
here if needed to brief him. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the president strolled Park City's Main Street,  
shaking hands and visiting the historic jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenberg, co-partner with Steven Spielberg and David Geffen in  
DreamWorks SKG, is a big campaign donor to Clinton and other 
Democrats. The former Walt Disney Co. studio chief is a frequent 
guest at the White House and Clinton has stayed at his Malibu, 
Calif., home.

<HEADLINE> Challenge for the Young Is the Old / Commentary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Business Analyst    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Americans' productivity seems to be rising  
again, which provides a base for the soaring confidence so strongly 
expressed not only in surveys but in stocks, spending and 
borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising productivity -- more output per hours worked -- is the  
basis of wealth creation and is thus the one great essential for 
any lifestyle improvements that can be expressed in financial 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
	It may continue for a while too, since much of the improvement  
in productivity results from information technology, a broad 
category of services that is transforming production processes at 
all levels. 
</P>
<P>
	That's quite an abstraction, for sure, but you get a sense of it  
when you consider that this technology now designs and runs 
factories and is essential to the growing list of services you 
purchase. Your income tax return, for example, and the quality of 
your health care. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a business of younger people, of entrepreneurs with a  
vision of changing the world, and a sense that nothing can hold 
them back. Why shouldn't they feel confident -- guys like Bill Gates 
have been doing it. 
</P>
<P>
	But now comes an inevitable test of the rising productivity that  
has been so good to so many. The customers are growing older, and a 
question arises of their willingness to accept change. 
</P>
<P>
	American Demographics magazine recently commented, for example,  
that women between ages 40 and 64 will soon constitute America's 
largest population segment. Older people drive up health care 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the challenge: Will information technology and other  
developments of the information age be able to keep those costs 
within bounds? Will such costs drain funds from other productive 
uses? 
</P>
<P>
	Late last month, physicians attending a meeting of the  
Independent Physicians Association of America in San Diego were 
told that health care premiums for workers might rise 6 percent to 
9 percent this year. 
</P>
<P>
	That forecast, by Howard Veit of Towers Perrin, a health  
industry consultancy, follows a trend already developing in which 
employers seek to shift more of the costs to individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	This could be trouble -- for consumers of health care who may be  
forced to spend more out of pocket, and a challenge for doctors, 
who might find their clients shopping around for the lowest fees. 
</P>
<P>
	This, said Veit, is the third age in the development of managed  
health care, the first being the Age of the Idealist, when anything 
seemed possible, followed by the Age of the Entrepreneur, when 
creative cost-cutting became the goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Age of Consumerism is managed care's third phase, and nobody  
knows how it will work out. What will today's easy-spending 
consumers think when they sense the marketplace is plucking bills 
from their pocketbooks? 
</P>
<P>
	What will all those young folks who have created this new world  
of information technology do to help keep costs down, a loaded 
question in view of the fact that they too will be getting older? 
</P>
<P>
	And, if not contained, will health care costs, now beginning to  
escape from restraints imposed in the Age of the Entrepreneur, 
undermine the pricing serenity so important to productivity growth?

<HEADLINE> Cape Hatteras Beacon Extinguished </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUXTON, N.C. (AP) -- The beacon atop the nation's tallest  
lighthouse was darkened Monday for the first time since 1950 as 
movers prepare to move the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse inland. 
</P>
<P>
	The 208-foot-tall structure with its barber pole striping is  
being moved 2,900 feet inland to preserve it from the encroaching 
Atlantic Ocean, which has crept within 120 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	The $9.8 million move is expected to be completed by September,  
said Rob Bolling, a National Park Service ranger and historian at 
the lighthouse visitor center. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from light bulbs burning out, the beacon has operated  
continuously since 1950, Bolling said. 
</P>
<P>
	The beacon once helped sailors navigate the often treacherous  
waters off Cape Hatteras, known as the ``Graveyard of the 
Atlantic.'' The beacon is seldom used today because of the 
availability of high-tech navigation aids.

<HEADLINE> Pac-10 Raps Refs in Cal-ASU Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WALNUT CREEK, Calif. (AP) -- Officials working the Arizona  
State-California basketball game mistakenly gave the ball to 
California after a double technical foul with 22 seconds left in a 
game the Bears won 78-73, the Pac-10 Conference said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials -- Jerry White, Steve Wilson and George Arredondo --  
were reprimanded by the league and will not officiate Pac-10 games 
in November. 
</P>
<P>
	On the play in question Sunday, California got the ball after a  
foul was called on an ASU player, followed by a flagrant technical 
on a player from each team. California was ahead 70-66 at that 
point. 
</P>
<P>
	California made both free throws for the foul, for a 72-66 lead,  
then made two more free throws when ASU was forced to foul on Cal's 
inbounds play. 
</P>
<P>
	Booker Turner, head of basketball officiating for the  
conference, said that because the double technicals were called 
while the ball was dead, the ball should have gone to the team 
favored by the possession arrow -- ASU -- not the team which had the 
ball when play stopped, which was California.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Drug Certification Likely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress seems unlikely to undo President  
Clinton's certification of Mexico as a cooperative ally in the war 
on drugs, despite some sharp criticism of the decision and a House 
promise to make a ``thorough review.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While several lawmakers indicated they would introduce a  
resolution to overturn the certification, leadership aides said 
Monday it seemed doubtful the measure could win a majority in both 
chambers -- let alone the two-thirds needed to override a 
presidential veto. A similar effort failed last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has 30 days, until April 1, to act.  
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly there are not the votes to succeed with a challenge,  
and having a divisive battle on the floor makes no sense,'' said 
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., a leader in the 1998 effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Required by Congress since 1986, the annual review has served as  
a way for the U.S. government to bring pressure to bear on foreign 
governments to crack down on the drug trade. 
</P>
<P>
	But it has also generated criticism on Capitol Hill from members  
who noted that most hard drugs coming into the United States come 
from Mexico and Colombia. Colombia was also recertified by Clinton, 
but that decision was less controversial. 
</P>
<P>
	In its annual review of 28 countries that produce or serve as a  
conduit for illegal drugs, the Clinton administration cited only 
two countries -- Burma and Afghanistan -- for not fully cooperating 
in counter-narcotics efforts. By law, countries found not to be 
fully cooperative can be subject to economic sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Both House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and Senate Majority  
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., have hinted they don't plan to make a 
major effort to block the certification. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the strongest opposition is coming from influential  
House members. 
</P>
<P>
	House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., said, ``Mexico has  
not done enough to meet the requirements of our law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Rep. John L. Mica, R-Fla., chairman of the Government Reform  
subcommittee on counter-narcotics, accused the administration of a 
``whitewash.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In terms of cooperation, we get a big fat zero from Mexico on  
specifics,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mica has scheduled a Thursday meeting by his subcommittee to  
consider the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``The speaker has asked us to do a thorough review,'' Mica said,  
adding he did not think the speaker was ``closed to 
decertification.''

<HEADLINE> Purchasing Index Reverses Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The nation's manufacturing sector reawakened in  
February after an eight-month decline as production, orders for new 
business and export orders increased significantly, corporate 
purchasing executives said in a survey released today. The results 
provided the first hints that U.S. factories were winning back some 
of the business they lost to the Asian economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Purchasing Management reported its  
monthly index of business activity rose to 52.4 percent last month, 
an increase of 2.9 percentage points from its January level. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAPM assesses the health of the nation's factories, and in  
turn the overall economy, through a monthly survey of its members. 
The trade group's findings are widely followed by economists 
including Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan because 
they usually are the first indicator of how the economy performed 
in the just-ended month. 
</P>
<P>
	``The survey indicates the worst effects of the economic turmoil  
around the world are behind us,'' said Marilyn Schaja, money market 
economist at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Securities Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the most significant change in the manufacturing sector  
was a surge in export orders, which rose for the first time since 
November 1997. The NAPM's New Export Orders Index surged 4.2 
percentage points to 54.0 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Though it may be premature to say that manufacturing is back,  
particularly with the persistent softness in prices, this certainly 
signals a possible reversal of recent fortunes in the sector,'' 
said Norbert J. Ore, chairman of the NAPM's survey committee. 
</P>
<P>
	January's report had hinted at a turnaround -- although  
manufacturing declined for an eighth straight month, the rate of 
decline was slower. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchasing managers' February report means the overall  
economy continued to strengthen as well. Further evidence that the 
economy remains robust came in a separate report today from the 
Commerce Department, which said Americans' personal incomes rose a 
strong 0.6 percent in January, while spending rose a moderate 0.3 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturing has been one of the only laggards in the expanding  
U.S. economy as the financial turmoil in Asia and Latin America 
sapped demand for U.S. products. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAPM said that of the 20 industries in the manufacturing  
sector, nine reported improved business in February, with wood and 
related products and tobacco posting the strongest gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the overall strong numbers, there were still weak spots  
in the manufacturing sector. Manufacturing employment declined for 
a ninth consecutive month, the NAPM said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Employment tends to be a bit of a lagging indicator,'' Schaja  
said. ``Going forward, I think it will improve along with the 
industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	February marked the 94th consecutive month of overall U.S.  
economic growth, the NAPM said.

<HEADLINE> FDA OKs Mousse To Treat Psoriasis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Patients who suffer psoriasis of the scalp won  
a slightly different kind of treatment Monday: a mousse-like foam 
to rub onto scalp lesions with less mess than traditional drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, the main treatment has been a lotion containing the  
chemical betamethasone, but putting a lotion on the scalp every day 
is messy and greasy. The Food and Drug Administration approved 
Connetics Corp.'s new version of betamethasone, an easier-to-apply 
foam called Luxiq. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 3.5 million Americans have scalp psoriasis, marked  
by redness, scaling, severe itching and irritation. 
</P>
<P>
	In one study of 172 patients, 72 percent treated with Luxiq had  
complete or almost complete clearance of their psoriasis outbreak, 
compared with 47 percent who used a betamethasone lotion. 
</P>
<P>
	Connetics said Luxiq will be available in about six weeks. A  
final price has not been set, but a spokeswoman said it would be 
about $50 to $60 for a 100-gram bottle.

<HEADLINE> GEC Buys Reltec for $1.7 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- British engineering group General Electric Co.  
plans to buy Cleveland-based telecommunications equipment maker 
Reltec Corp. for $1.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition, announced Monday, will give London-based GEC, a  
high-technology company focused on defense electronics and 
communications, greater distribution channels in North America. GEC 
is not related to the Connecticut-based industrial giant General 
Electric Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Both of the companies' board of directors have approved the  
merger, which is still subject to federal approval. The deal also 
calls for GEC to assume $361 million in debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Reltec is a leader in the design, manufacture and sale of  
telecommunication network products and employs about 6,600 
employees worldwide. The company's key U.S. customers include 
Ameritech, AT&AMP;T, Bell Atlantic, BellSouth, GTE, Sprint, US West and 
WorldCom MCI. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, GEC announced an agreement to separate and merge its  
defense electronics business with British Aerospace.

<HEADLINE> George Mason Celebrates Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) -- It had been so long since George Mason cut  
down the nets after a victory that coach Jim Larranaga actually had 
his players practice it first. 
</P>
<P>
	Then they did it for real, earning only the second NCAA  
tournament bid in school history. 
</P>
<P>
	The big celebration came Sunday night, when the Patriots  
defeated Old Dominion 63-58 to win the Colonial Athletic 
Association tournament in Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
	By Monday, Larranga was a miracle worker-in-demand, soaking in a  
rare day of attention at a school that has barely registered a blip 
on the national basketball screen. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a long road,'' Larranaga said. ``But well worth the  
wait.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dress rehearsal had come a week earlier, when Mason beat  
American in the final regular-season game at home. It was an easy 
victory and the Patriots had already clinched the title, but 
Larranaga told his players to have some fun and cut down the nets 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did that because, quite frankly, over the last seven or  
eight years, the George Mason faithful really have not had a lot to 
celebrate,'' Larranaga said. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the game was over, I told the players there's no greater  
way to prepare ourselves for what it would be like to win the CAA 
tournament and celebrate than to practice it. And that's what we 
did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	George Mason was expected to make a splash in the 1990s, but  
under Paul Westhead, the former NBA coach who brought his 
fast-break game to Fairfax in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Westhead's teams never came close to a winning record  
and his players had off-the-court troubles. He was fired after four 
seasons and a 38-70 record. 
</P>
<P>
	Larranaga, who had 12 successful seasons at Bowling Green,  
arrived in 1997, put the emphasis on defense and went 9-18 his 
first year. This season, his Patriots are 19-10, one short of the 
school record for victories. 
</P>
<P>
	But it took a midseason savvy coaching move to pull it all  
together. It was Jan. 30. The Patriots had lost three of their 
previous four in the conference, marring a school-best 5-0 start. 
</P>
<P>
	So, in a big game at home against James Madison, Larranaga  
started five players who are usually subs -- the Green Team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our White Team had started to feel stressed,'' Larranaga said.  
``They were showing signs of frustration. I couldn't understand 
why, other than they wanted to win so badly it was difficult for 
them to relax and enjoy playing basketball and have fun. Our Green 
Team was practicing well, enjoying it, beating the White Team in 
practice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Green Team held its own, and the score was 10-8 when the  
starters entered the game. Mason went on to beat Madison and hasn't 
lost since. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a gamble,'' Larranaga said. ``But it certainly paid  
off, because the Green Team did a great job, and it helped the 
White Team to relax. After the game was over, it allowed me to go 
deep into my bench the rest of the season and use the Green Team as 
a unit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Patriots' winning streak is now 10. They are led by senior  
guard Jason Miskiri and 27-year-old sophomore forward George Evans, 
a Gulf War veteran and the CAA's player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Now it gets tougher. The previous George Mason team to make the  
NCAAs, Ernie Nestor's team 10 years ago, had to face Indiana and 
was gone after one round. 
</P>
<P>
	Larranaga's team won't get much more respect from the seeding  
committee. After all, Mason is 0-11 lifetime vs. the Atlantic Coast 
Conference, 1-9 vs. the Big East, 2-10 vs. the Atlantic 10. It also 
hurts that Evans played in the CAA final with a severe ankle sprain 
and will need plenty of rehab the next 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	But CAA teams have been known to pull the upset. Larranaga  
watched one himself 12 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, when I watched Richmond beat South Carolina in the  
first round of the NCAA tournament at the MCI Center, I said to 
myself, `I want that to be us next year.' ''

<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Amy Fisher has dropped a $220 million  
lawsuit claiming she was raped and abused by prison guards. 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old charged in 1996 that she was raped by five  
officers at the Albion Correctional Facility. 
</P>
<P>
	She is serving a 5- to 15-year sentence for the 1992 shooting of  
Mary Jo Buttafuoco, the wife of her former lover, Joey Buttafuoco. 
</P>
<P>
	In dropping the lawsuit, Ms. Fisher isn't implying her charges  
were false, said her attorney, Thomas McVann Jr. Rather, he said, 
they were discouraged by a federal judge's repeated rulings against 
her.

<HEADLINE> Ford To Settle With Fed Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. is expected to reach a settlement  
soon that will require it to pay between $250,000 and $500,000 in 
civil fines for withholding documents during a federal safety 
agency's investigation of fires in Ford cars and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement should be signed in the next three weeks, a  
source close to the negotiations said Monday, speaking on condition 
of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue in the case are allegations by attorneys for State Farm  
Insurance that Ford failed to disclose documents as required to the 
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The documents 
related to steering-column fires believed caused by defective 
ignition switches on some Ford vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	State Farm asked the agency last year to rule whether Ford was  
guilty of nondisclosure. 
</P>
<P>
	The insurer is suing Ford to recover millions of dollars it says  
it paid in claims for fire damage caused by the switches. Ford 
recalled 8.7 million vehicles in 1996 to replace the ignition 
switches -- the largest recall by a single automaker in U.S. 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ford maintains only a fraction of the just over 1,300  
steering column fires reported out of 23.5 million Ford vehicles 
built from 1988 to 1993 were possibly related to the switches. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford has said it made a mistake last year when it told the  
agency that it had provided a document when, in fact, it had not. 
Ford maintains that other documents cited by State Farm either were 
disclosed or revealed redundant information. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we believe we have always been responsive to NHTSA,  
going forward, we will hew to the plain meaning of any agency 
request for `all' documents,'' Ford spokesman Jim Cain said. ``Our 
policy will be to err on the side of providing too much 
information, even if it means duplication.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agency last year criticized Ford for not disclosing enough  
information in two earlier safety investigations. In each case, the 
disclosure charges were brought by attorneys suing Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	``Never again do we want to find ourselves in the position of  
having to defend our reputation and products because a plaintiff's 
attorney can point to a handful of documents -- some of which may 
not be material or relevant -- that may not have been submitted to 
NHTSA during an investigation,'' Cain said.

<HEADLINE> Memorial Service Held for Arsonist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEEKSKILL, N.Y. (AP) -- A born-again Christian whose family home  
was destroyed by a neighbor performed what he called ``a simple act 
of forgiveness'' -- making sure the man received a proper memorial 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	John Simmons was remembered -- honored, even -- at the First  
Baptist Church in Peekskill on Sunday, nearly two months after he 
died in the fire he set at the nearby home of John and Glenys 
Singer. 
</P>
<P>
	Singer, a 44-year-old landscaper and a member of the Baptist  
congregation, had heard that Simmons' family was having trouble 
raising funds for a funeral. He asked the leaders of his own church 
for permission to offer the red brick building. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what Christians are supposed to be doing,'' Singer  
said in an interview. ``This is what Jesus said to do. I heard some 
people saying, `I'm glad he died in that fire,' and that's not 
right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 4, a distraught Simmons, recently separated from his  
wife Colleen, confronted her with a shotgun at the modest home they 
had shared in Peekskill. Their four children had left for school. 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons, 50, shot Mrs. Simmons, 37, once, and she fled around  
the corner to the Singer home. The Singers' door, usually locked, 
was open, and she got in just in time to avoid two blasts from the 
shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
	But Simmons followed her in. Mrs. Singer hustled Mrs. Simmons  
into a back room and put the Singers' two preschool children into a 
closet. Singer, who had gone to his basement study to dial 911, 
escaped out a back door and watched through a window as Simmons 
burst into the back room and shot Mrs. Simmons again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see my wife at the window and I see him with the gun and I  
know my kids are in there with him,'' Singer said the next day. 
``Colleen is up against the door of the closet and he's shooting at 
her. He just kept shooting her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, the entire Singer family escaped uninjured -- Simmons  
let the children go when he found them in the closet -- and Mrs. 
Simmons survived with injuries to her arms and hands. But Simmons 
himself perished after he set the Singers' house ablaze. 
</P>
<P>
	His body was found in a pile of ashes.  
</P>
<P>
	During Sunday's service, as a cold rain pelted the church just  
across the Hudson River from Bear Mountain, a hymn was sung 
haltingly and a few relatives reminisced about Simmons' early 
years. Then Singer rose and delivered a speech of generosity and 
conciliation. 
</P>
<P>
	He astonished the congregation by saying, ``If I had to pick a  
house for John to depart in, I would say, `Please, John, come to my 
home.''' Elaborating later, Singer said he likes to think that in 
the moments before Simmons died, as the house was burning around 
him, he might have repented because of all the religious material 
in view. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he had enough to look at and reflect and there's a  
good chance that the God that I serve wooed him at the last 
moment,'' Singer said.

<HEADLINE> Some Mail Is Better Left Unread </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Blasko's Law: Courtesy and good taste are inversely proportional  
to the distribution of computers in a society. 
</P>
<P>
	Multimedia computers and the expanding Internet are putting us  
more in touch with each other. But the mail brings evidence to 
suggest that we might be better off isolated. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, demo material arrived from a Los Gatos, Calif.,  
company for something called BoneStamp. It's a CD-ROM and a rubber 
stamp that enables you to attach a likeness of the middle-finger 
gesture to both e-mail and paper correspondence. 
</P>
<P>
	This contribution to civilization is being peddled on the Net  
for $14.99 through a site that doesn't merit identification. It is 
marketed as a way to respond to unsolicited e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, the problem in replying to unsolicited e-mail is that  
your reply often goes to everyone on the mailing list. And if you 
were offended by the original message, you now can commit an even 
nastier offense by including all those innocent victims in your 
crude, rude response. 
</P>
<P>
	For some of us, e-mail seems to unleash demons that wouldn't  
dare drag their cloven feet across a sheet of real paper. While 
questions and comments from readers are always welcome and often 
enlightening, the mail also brings some less-than-polite 
commentary. Such as: 
</P>
<P>
	``What the (bleep) is that? That's an advertisement, not a  
story. Ya (bleep)ing bonehead!'' These words of encouragement were 
in response to a positive review. 
</P>
<P>
	``You jerk!'' This salutation came courtesy of a reader who  
liked the iMac more than I did. The tone was continued throughout 
the letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Another iMac fan wrote: ``If I were your editor and you had  
submitted this piece to me, I'd have sent you back to the CRT until 
you came up with something useful to say to readers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Your skeptical, illogical and obviously Windows-biased opinion  
makes Bill (Gates) a rich man. You are a hegemonist of the worst 
kind,'' declared another iMac fan. 
</P>
<P>
	(Wondering if a hegemonist had to report to a parole officer, I  
visited an online dictionary, which assured me that a hegemonist 
merely advocated ``preponderant influence or authority over 
others.'') 
</P>
<P>
	And this is the milder stuff. More than 15 years of writing a  
column has elicited thousands of reader communications, but only 
with the advent of e-mail has the stuff begun to get nasty. The 
level of dignity in correspondence is certainly dropping. 
</P>
<P>
	This is also evident in software. It's sad to note that the sun  
has set on Purple Moon, a company that made excellent software for 
girls 8 to 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Purple Moon products focused on topics such as self-esteem,  
relationships, families and growing up -- not on blowing up things 
in violence-packed epics that, thanks to multimedia PCs, drip with 
more realistic gore by the day. Also, Purple Moon software didn't 
stereotype young girls as empty-headed clotheshorses more concerned 
about fashion than about achievement. 
</P>
<P>
	But the marketplace has spoken -- even though, like much about  
personal computing lately, the marketplace should have its mouth 
washed with soap. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

<HEADLINE> Kansas FB Player Out of Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) -- Kansas wide receiver Michael Chandler was  
released from the hospital Monday after a weekend shooting by 
masked intruders. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler left Lawrence Memorial Hospital on Monday morning,  
where he had surgery for a gunshot wound in the groin area. He was 
beaten and shot about 5 a.m. Saturday after answering a knock at 
the door of his off-campus townhouse and encountering three men 
wearing masks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael is going to spend a few days at home resting before  
returning to KU later this week,'' said Chandler's father, Ron 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Police haven't been able to conduct a thorough interview with  
Chandler yet, Sgt. Richard Nickell said Monday morning. No arrests 
had been made as of Monday and police said they had no suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have released few details. But one of Chandler's  
roommates told The Lawrence Journal-World that Chandler had been 
asleep on a couch when someone knocked on the door. When Chandler 
partially opened the door, the suspects kicked it in and one of 
them hit him across the ribs with a baseball bat, the roommate 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The assailants asked for Michael Chandler, he said, and after  
determining it was Chandler who had opened the door, one of the 
suspects shot him with a small-caliber handgun. The suspects then 
ran from the area, the roommate said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler, a 5-foot-11, 195-pound junior from Kansas City, Kan.,  
has 46 career receptions for 577 yards. Last season he was third on 
the team with 21 catches for 236 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been expected to sit out contact drills this spring while  
recovering from surgery to repair ligament damage in his left 
ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors said the injury from the shooting should have no effect  
on Chandler's football career at Kansas.

<HEADLINE> White House To Attack Counsel Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is withdrawing its  
support from the independent counsel law and intends to urge 
Congress to let the Watergate-inspired statute expire in June, 
according to a senior administration official. 
</P>
<P>
	With both Democrats and Republicans in Congress increasingly  
opposed to the law, Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder was 
announcing the administration's reversal before a House Judiciary 
subcommittee chaired by Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa., today. 
</P>
<P>
	Holder planned to tell the panel that the law, which provides  
for an independent counsel selected by three judges to investigate 
allegations against several dozen top administration officials, is 
``fundamentally flawed'' and should not be renewed this summer, 
this administration official said Monday night, requesting 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Holder planned to testify that a study group he chaired  
concluded that the Justice Department is capable of investigating 
and prosecuting most of the officials now covered by the law, the 
senior official said. 
</P>
<P>
	In rare cases in which there is a genuine conflict of interest,  
the attorney general could use long-standing statutory authority to 
hire a special counsel to conduct an investigation, Holder will 
say, according to the official. 
</P>
<P>
	Holder will cite the use of special counsels appointed by the  
attorney general in several scandals, including Teapot Dome and 
Watergate, as serving the country well, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition to the Independent Counsel Act directly reverses the  
Clinton administration's stance five years ago, when both President 
Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno successfully urged Congress 
to renew the law. 
</P>
<P>
	The new position was developed by the Justice Department task  
force and then cleared with the Office of Management and Budget and 
the White House as acceptable administration policy, the official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The law has never been popular among career Justice Department  
attorneys, many of whom viewed it as calling into question their 
integrity. But the first version was passed in 1978 with bipartisan 
support in Congress, largely in reaction to President Nixon's 
firing five years earlier of special counsel Archibald Cox during 
the Watergate investigation. Cox, who had been appointed by the 
attorney general, was replaced by Leon Jaworski, appointed by 
another attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
	In essence, Holder intended to tell the committee that the wrong  
lesson had been drawn from that episode, arguing that Jaworski did 
an effective job and independent investigators appointed by judges 
were not needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Support for the law among Republicans has been eroded by two  
events in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	They objected to the length of Lawrence Walsh's multiyear  
investigation of the Iran-Contra scandal during the Reagan and Bush 
administrations. 
</P>
<P>
	More recently, Republicans have groused about Reno's refusal to  
turn over to an independent counsel her department's investigation 
of campaign financing activities of Clinton, Vice President Al Gore 
and other Democrats in the 1996 election. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats have turned against the law because of the length and  
conduct of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation of 
Clinton over the Whitewater affair, his relationship with White 
House intern Monica Lewinsky and several other matters. Starr 
recommended Clinton's impeachment to the House last September. The 
Senate acquitted Clinton last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the Justice Department, officials have felt that some of  
the record seven independent counsels sought by Reno over the past 
six years overreached and exceeded their intended mandates. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the current law, the attorney general must ask a  
three-judge panel to select an independent counsel if she believes 
there is enough evidence to warrant a full criminal investigation 
of certain top administration officials. The independent prosecutor 
is given an unlimited budget to hire aides and conduct an 
investigation with no time limit. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno is scheduled to testify on the issue later this month  
before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.

<HEADLINE> 49ers Trade Gogan to Dolphins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Guard Kevin Gogan, a Pro Bowl  
selection in each of the past two seasons for the San Francisco 
49ers, was traded Monday to the Miami Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49ers, seeking more maneuvering room under the salary cap,  
were shopping Gogan for several weeks and received an undisclosed 
draft choice from Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco free safety Merton Hanks, another former Pro  
Bowler, also is on the trading block. 
</P>
<P>
	The dealing of Gogan is the latest in a series of sweeping  
personnel moves by the 49ers, who began the offseason $28 million 
over the $57.3 million cap. 
</P>
<P>
	Some $30 million has been lopped off the team's 1999 player  
payroll in recent weeks through trades, contract restructurings, 
the release of players and the loss of three others in the 
Cleveland expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Director of football operations John McVay said the dealing of  
Gogan gave the 49ers $400,000 in immediate cap relief and millions 
of dollars more over the next three years. Gogan's contract runs 
through 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always tough when you have a veteran retire or be  
traded,'' McVay said. ``Kevin has been a good football player and a 
good guy. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the purpose of doing the deal was for long-range cap  
planning. Just as important is that we've got some young guys like 
Jeremy Newberry and Phil Ostrowski that we need to bring along. 
We've got to get them in and play. Kevin was a 12-year veteran.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gogan, one of the league's most imposing linemen at 6-foot-7,  
330 pounds, will be joining his fourth NFL team. Before coming to 
San Francisco as a free agent, Gogan played for the Raiders and 
Cowboys, where he played for current Miami coach Jimmy Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very excited about going to Miami,'' said Gogan. ``I  
talked to Jimmy a couple times (Monday). I've played for him 
before, obviously, and I've got a nice piece of (Super Bowl) 
hardware in my safe from him. I realize this is a great chance for 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson liked the idea of adding a familiar face to his blocking  
unit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kevin and I go back a long ways,'' Johnson said. ``I've seen  
his development and I think he is one of the outstanding offensive 
linemen in this league. He was been to Pro Bowls and he sets an 
attitude for the offensive line. He is the type of guy who we're 
looking for. And I think with this move, it solidifies the kind of 
offensive line for which we've been looking for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Gogan, who was part of a San Francisco line that helped  
Garrison Hearst set a team rushing record (1,549 yards), said he at 
first found the trade rumors hard to believe. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of funny. I was in the locker room at the Pro Bowl  
when somebody told me he heard I was going to be traded,'' Gogan 
said. ``I kind of laughed and said, `It's not true.' But more and 
more people said it, and obviously, it turned into something. I 
still never thought I'd be traded, especially when you did 
everything they asked you to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New general manager Bill Walsh, however, has long preferred  
smaller, athletic offensive linemen, which was another reason he 
opted to trade Gogan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess they want 6-foot, 285-pound linemen. I couldn't help  
him there,'' Gogan quipped.

<HEADLINE>  Cuban Dissidents Go On Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- The sedition trial of four dissidents in Cuba's  
biggest human rights case in years will test how much the 
government heeds international opinion while pushing a new tough 
stance against the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial was to begin today for the three men and one woman  
arrested in July 1997 for criticizing a major Communist Party 
document. The case has drawn expressions of concern from the 
Vatican, the United States and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	National Revolutionary Police in blue uniforms and plainclothes  
state security agents barred about two dozen journalists from 
approaching the courthouse, located on a side street in Havana. 
Cameramen and photographers were forbidden to stand on a street 
corner to capture images of police blocking the main road to the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no information about what was going on inside the  
building. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope I will be able to bring my husband home,'' Magaly de  
Armas, wife of defendant Vladimiro Roca, said as she and her 
daughter arrived today. If not, de Armas said, she and her husband 
were ``prepared for anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The top defendant is Roca, a former military pilot and son of  
the late Cuban Communist Party leader Blas Roca. Also charged are 
Rene Gomez Manzano, engineer Felix Bonne and economist Marta 
Beatriz Roque. 
</P>
<P>
	``My hope is that they are freed, that justice is done,'' De  
Armas said over the weekend. ``I still don't see the crime in 
writing down your opinion in a peaceful manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives said many of the dissidents' supporters have been  
detained by state security agents in recent days, apparently to 
prevent protests outside the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials, who never comment on such detentions, were  
infuriated by a demonstration last year outside the trial of 
another dissident, which was widely reported by foreign media. 
</P>
<P>
	Communist officials insist there are no political prisoners in  
Cuba, only people jailed for common crimes. They reject the 
characterization of the four as prisoners of conscience. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial was expected to last several days.  
</P>
<P>
	The four dissidents distributed a critique of a draft economic  
plan being considered the Communist Party Congress, saying it did 
not present solutions to Cuba's severe problems. They also held two 
news conferences with foreign journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	When they were charged last fall, the prosecution recommended a  
six-year sentence for Roca and five years each for the others. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the government has passed a tough, broadly worded  
law aimed at silencing dissidents. Those convicted can face up to 
20 years in prison. The four cannot be tried under the new law, but 
it signals a tougher government stance toward the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	The government, however, has also come under heavy pressure over  
human rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Most notably, Pope John Paul II visited Cuba in January 1998,  
calling for fundamental freedoms, respect for human rights and an 
independent civil society. More than 80 prisoners were freed after 
his visit.

<HEADLINE> Top 7 Stays Same in AP Women's Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Purdue led a top seven that stayed the same today in The  
Associated Press women's basketball poll, and Tulane joined at No. 
24 as the first newcomer in three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	With one poll remaining in the 1998-99 season, Purdue (27-1)  
received 37 of 41 first-place votes and 1,020 points from a 
national media panel to lead the rankings for the second straight 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 2 Tennessee (28-2) received two votes for first and had 983

Southeastern Conference tournament for the second consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue ran its winning streak to 25 by defeating Northwestern  
and Ohio State to reach tonight's finals in the Big Ten tournament. 
The Boilermakers and Tennessee are expected to get No. 1 seeds when 
the NCAA tournament field is announced next Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana Tech (24-2), which has lost only to Purdue and

<HEADLINE> Blacks Launch Boycott in N.C. Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.C. (AP) -- Black residents launched a week-long  
boycott of businesses in this eastern North Carolina town because 
the Town Council won't annex outlying black areas and the mayor 
says blacks shouldn't run local government. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got to put some pressure somewhere,'' said Walter Robinson,  
a boycott organizer. ``If we're not accepted in the town, we'll 
stop using stuff in the town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Joffree Leggett told a newspaper last week that he and the  
Town Council opposed annexing black areas because they do not want 
blacks to take over town government. 
</P>
<P>
	Trenton, a community of 200, has 23 black residents. Three  
adjacent unincorporated areas are predominantly black. 
</P>
<P>
	Leggett said last week that if three blacks worked in a store  
together, ``within a few years they'd be stealing from each other, 
and they'd be out of business. They're not leaders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He later said he was referring to three blacks like one of the  
six plaintiffs in a federal lawsuit accusing the town of racist 
annexation policies, but stood by the rest of the statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The state National Association for the Advancement of Colored  
People chapter is calling for Leggett's resignation, but Leggett 
has said he will not resign.

<HEADLINE> USOC Ethics Report To Be Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For the last three months, the International  
Olympic Committee has dealt with the biggest scandal in its 
history, the million-dollar bribery case stemming from Salt Lake's 
winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the IOC is about to get some advice -- and maybe some blame  
-- from an elite ethics report. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel, chaired by former Senate Majority Leader George  
Mitchell, releases its report today. While it worked behind closed 
doors through the early morning to finish its task, it appeared the 
IOC's role in the Salt Lake case -- and what it could do to avoid 
such scandals in the future -- was a prominent part of the 
commission's agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	A source with knowledge of the investigation told The Associated  
Press on Sunday night that the IOC's role in the scandal and its 
cleanup was likely to be a focus of the Mitchell report. 
</P>
<P>
	``The report will include some really creative things that the  
IOC should do to go forward, things we haven't heard about 
before,'' the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC already has expelled five members and is investigating  
13 others in connection with the scandal. It has announced plans to 
radically change the way it selects Olympic host cities and even 
break its historic secrecy by submitting to frequent audits and 
issuing financial reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell said last week his panel would focus on future bids to  
try to make sure the vote-buying scheme of Salt Lake is not 
repeated. 
</P>
<P>
	The next games for an American city to bid on won't be held  
until 2012, but the route to those Olympics will be laid out today 
in Mitchell's report. 
</P>
<P>
	``The emphasis will be on recommendations for rules, compliance  
and enforcement which we hope, if adopted, will avoid a recurrence 
of the type of action that led to the creation of the commission,'' 
Mitchell said last week. 
</P>
<P>
	That probably will mean strict limits or the elimination of  
gifts from bid cities to IOC members, the heart of the Salt Lake 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, which staged the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta  
and will play host to the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake, won't 
have another chance until the IOC picks the city for 2012. Eight 
U.S. cities are vying to be the American candidate for that race, 
which will be decided in 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell and the rest of his panel, including former White House  
chief of staff Ken Duberstein and baseball union leader Donald 
Fehr, refused to discuss details of their two-month inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission submits its report to the U.S. Olympic  
Committee's executive board just before releasing it at a news 
conference. The USOC is to respond at its own news conference 
Wednesday in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell's commission is a standing ethics watchdog for the  
USOC, appointed last year by committee president Bill Hybl. But to 
underscore the commission's independence, no USOC officials will 
share the stage with Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
	While the IOC and Salt Lake City Olympic officials have been  
damaged in the scandal, the USOC has escaped virtually unscathed. 
But two areas in which it did take hits are expected to be 
mentioned by the Mitchell report. 
</P>
<P>
	One is staff oversight. Alfredo la Mont resigned as the USOC's  
director of international relations last month after it was 
revealed he did consulting work for Salt Lake bid leader Tom Welch. 
Olympic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said at the 
time that La Mont was paid to gather information on IOC members in 
Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Another is training programs for foreign athletes. The USOC  
regularly provides facilities and supervision at its training 
centers for athletes from other nations, usually from the Third 
World. 
</P>
<P>
	While such programs are seen to epitomize the Olympic ideals of  
competition and fairness, cases in the United States and Australia 
showed they could also be used to help bid committees foster 
goodwill with attractive packages offered around voting time. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell also may take aim at the IOC, either in the report or  
in a separate statement, according to sources familiar with the 
investigation who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	As with two reports into Salt Lake already released, Mitchell's  
commission lacked subpoena power and had to rely heavily on public 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	It received almost 200,000 documents from USOC files as well as  
responses from letters sent to some 400 present and former 
committee officials and staff members. The letter asked about gifts 
they received from Salt Lake or other cities hoping to be America's 
candidate for the 1998 and 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	All gifts, which could be as mundane as T-shirts or as  
extravagant as ski trips, are expected to be banned under upcoming 
USOC and IOC reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington will keep a close eye on the Mitchell report and USOC  
response, plus action by a special IOC assembly in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department is investigating possible bribery, mail  
fraud and tax violations in the Salt Lake scandal, and the Senate 
Commerce Committee is considering hearings on the Olympics that 
could be aimed at punishing the IOC.

<HEADLINE>  Haiti Senator's Death Raises Fears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- A Haitian senator was shot and  
killed today in a Port-au-Prince suburb, raising new fears of 
political instability in this impoverished Caribbean nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean-Yvon Toussaint, 47, was killed in Delmas, said Sen. Samuel  
Madistin. The shooting occurred in front of Toussaint's home at 8 
a.m., Radio Metropole reported. 
</P>
<P>
	No more details were immediately available, and there was no  
word of arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	Toussaint, a medical doctor and a member of the Struggling  
People's Organization party, was elected to Haiti's Senate in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The slaying renewed fears of political instability created by a  
prolonged political crisis in Haiti -- concerns highlighted in a 
report last week by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. 
</P>
<P>
	Haiti has been without a premier since June 1997 because of a  
power struggle between President Rene Preval and opposition 
lawmakers. On Jan. 11, Preval dissolved Parliament and said he 
would appoint a premier by decree, triggering charges he was 
leading Haiti back to dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, Preval's sister, Marie-Claude Calvin, was shot and  
wounded and her bodyguard was killed in a street attack in 
Port-au-Prince. No arrests were made in that attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's slaying underscored the need for a rapid solution to the  
political crisis, said Mischa Gaillard, a leader of the socialist 
National Congress of Democratic Movements who, with other 
politicians, has been negotiating with Preval. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been trying to negotiate a solution -- and then  
suddenly this assassination explodes, poisoning the atmosphere, 
calling the negotiation process in question,'' Gaillard said. ``Our 
options are clear -- they are either chaos or compromise.''

<HEADLINE> Troubled Lender Files Chapter 11 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Consumer lender United Companies  
Financial Corp. plans to file for federal bankruptcy protection 
while it reorganizes its finances. 
</P>
<P>
	United provides consumer and mortgage loans to customers who  
cannot qualify for standard financing. 
</P>
<P>
	In another move, the company said Deborah Hick Midanek will  
become chief executive, replacing J. Terrell Brown, who recently 
took a 90-day leave of absence. Brown will continue as a board 
member. 
</P>
<P>
	United's announcements Monday followed its disclosure last month  
that it would not meet some of its debt obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it planned to continue operations during  
reorganization but has closed 28 branches and eight satellite 
offices to match production volume with financing capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	United Companies had been looking for a partner to inject  
capital following last summer's collapse of the market for 
high-yield bonds it used to raise money for loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenwich Capital Financial Products Inc. and The CIT  
Group-Business Credit Inc. have agreed to provide $500 million of 
debtor-in-possession financing and loan purchase facility, United 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	That agreement will have to be approved by a federal bankruptcy  
judge. United planned to filed in bankruptcy court in Wilmington, 
Del. 
</P>
<P>
	``The agreements with Greenwich and CIT will provide the company  
with the flexibility and time necessary to establish itself as a 
whole loan sale company,'' United said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	When Brown took the leave, United said he intended to pursue  
personal interests, including a possible buyout. Midanek joined the 
company as a full-time consultant in December and took over most of 
Brown's responsibilities last month after she was named vice 
president and chief restructuring officer.

<HEADLINE> NFL May Rotate Thanksgiving Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- The Detroit Lions again are defending  
their 64-year-old tradition of playing host to Thanksgiving Day 
football. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice Chairman William Clay Ford Jr. said he learned Monday that  
NFL owners will discuss the possibility of rotating the two 
Thanksgiving Day games among all 31 teams, rather than just Detroit 
and the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
	The switch, which would be effective with the 2000 season, is on  
the owners' agenda for their meetings March 14-18 in Phoenix. And 
they can expect an all-out fight against it from the Lions, said 
Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would never give up without a good fight, and I think I've  
got some pretty good ammo on my side,'' Ford told the Detroit Free 
Press for Tuesday's editions. ``We've got some pretty powerful 
people here in Michigan, and I'm going to leave no stone unturned. 
I'm going to have a scorched-earth policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal to rotate the Thanksgiving games including Dallas'  
-- itself a tradition since 1966 -- is backed by owners Lamar Hunt of 
the Kansas City Chiefs and Tom Benson of the New Orleans Saints. It 
would need support by 24 of the 31 owners to pass. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar proposal by Hunt was shot down in 1995 after Ford  
enlisted the support of his family's own Ford Motor Co. and the 
other two Big Three automakers, who are major NFL advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford hinted Monday that the automakers might be part of another  
defense of the Lions' Thanksgiving game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you'll see some interesting forces marshaled here,''  
he told the Detroit News.

<HEADLINE> Senate Takes Up Y2K Lawsuit Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate wants to help small businesses deal  
with Year 2000 computer crashes as part of a ``Y2K Day'' devoted to 
making people more aware of the problems that could arise from 
computers not prepared for the new millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	A special Senate panel on the Year 2000 computer problem also  
was releasing a report today detailing widespread disturbances that 
could occur on and after Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The authors of the report, Sens. Bob Bennett, R-Utah, and  
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., wrote in a letter to their colleagues 
last week that all sectors of the economy ``are at risk, including 
public utilities, health care, telecommunications, transportation, 
banking and finance, commerce and small business and national 
security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One major concern, the report says, is that 90 percent of  
doctors haven't fixed their computers and could temporarily lose 
medical records and smaller hospitals may not be fully prepared for 
possible shutdowns in medical devices such as dialysis machines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate planned to spend the afternoon discussing the report,  
which emphasizes that for most people disruptions will be minor -- 
phones will work and planes will keep flying -- but recommends that 
people stock extra food and water in the event of temporary 
shortages. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate also was voting today on a measure sponsored by Sen.  
Christopher Bond, R-Mo., that would require the Small Business 
Administration to guarantee loans for businesses trying to fix 
their own computers or threatened by the Y2K problems of their 
suppliers, customers or financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the noncontroversial legislation, the SBA is expected to  
guarantee about $500 million in loans through the end of the 
program on Dec. 31, 2000. Studies have concluded that up to 750,000 
small businesses could be severely hurt or be forced to shut down 
because of the glitch in many computers that keeps them from 
differentiating between the year 2000 and the year 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett and Dodd also were going behind closed doors with other  
senators during the day to discuss Y2K-related national security 
and international issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon, which was explaining its Y2K readiness at a House  
hearing today, insists that its thousands of computer systems will 
be upgraded by the end of the year and there will be contingency 
plans in the event of any malfunctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Of greater concern is the threat of a severe economic blow to  
the countries around the world lagging in their Y2K preparations. 
Russia in particular could face midwinter energy shortages and 
breakdowns in its nuclear power and missile systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday took up a more  
controversial bill, a measure sponsored by Sens. Orrin Hatch, 
R-Utah, and Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., that would limit lawsuits 
arising from Y2K breakdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill has strong backing from the business community, which  
warns that Y2K problems could result in up to $1 trillion in 
lawsuits. U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Thomas Donohue told 
the Judiciary Committee that one estimate is that for every dollar 
spent fixing the problem, $2 or $3 will be spent in courts. 
``Obviously, this scenario would be a monumental tragedy for 
American businesses, workers and consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the administration, backed by trial lawyers, has blocked all  
previous efforts by the GOP-led Congress to reduce punitive damages 
in product liability cases. Assistant Attorney General Eleanor 
Acheson, at the hearing, questioned whether the legislation could 
undercut the incentives for fixing Y2K problems and ``prevent 
businesses and consumers with legitimate claims from vindicating 
their rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would set aside a 90-day ``problem-solving'' period  
allowing companies to remedy problems before lawsuits can be filed. 
It would encourage mediation, limit punitive damages and put some 
restrictions on class-action lawsuits. The Senate Commerce 
Committee is to vote Wednesday on a similar bill sponsored by its 
chairman, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.

<HEADLINE> Mayor Candidate's Phony Site Closed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The designer of a phony Internet Web site  
for Philadelphia mayoral candidate John White has apologized for 
``harming his campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The four-paragraph apology was posted on the site Sunday after  
the initial Web design was pulled off the Internet. The site was 
apparently designed by someone connected to an opponent's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy over the fake Web site has cost the jobs of two  
top campaign aides to Democratic rival Dwight Evans. At issue were 
quotes attributed to White, taken from a Spanish-language 
newspaper, about how black and Latino voters ought to consolidate 
political power. 
</P>
<P>
	The White campaign said it does not a have a Web page and that  
the quote was taken out of context. They also suggested the site 
was created as a smear campaign to create racial controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Evans and White are black. They are seeking the Democratic  
nomination in the race to replace Mayor Edward Rendell, who is 
barred by the city charter from seeking a third term. 
</P>
<P>
	The page was registered to Robert Richman, 23, a Cambridge,  
Mass., Web site designer whom Evans said was ``associated'' with 
his deputy campaign manager David J. Sirota. 
</P>
<P>
	Sirota was fired, Evans said. Campaign manager John T. Fugett  
resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	The page had displayed in large letters a quote from a White  
interview in Al Dia, which said, ``The black and the brown, if we 
unite, we're going to control this city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White said the quote was accurate, but had been taken out of  
context in Al Dia. What he meant, he said, was that minorities 
should participate in the political process. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, only the four-paragraph statement appeared on the  
site. ``I see I have done more harm than good,'' it said. ``I want 
to first and foremost apologize to Mr. White for harming his 
campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Attorney's Office said it would look into whether any  
campaign laws were violated.

<HEADLINE> Capital Reflects American Society </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- This is a city of inspiration and spite, of  
spring bloom and eternal ambition, a low-rise marble capital that 
tourists honor and critics malign. 
</P>
<P>
	For one-fifth of the millennium now nearing its close,  
Washington has been the game board on which American politics 
fights its battles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Washington's main business is politics and this is savage  
business,'' New York Times columnist James Reston wrote in 1964. 
``Those who succeed here have almost more power than they can use, 
those who fail, more regrets than they can bear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alice Roosevelt Longworth, a tart-tongued presidential daughter,  
knew she would not lack for company when she placed a sofa pillow 
in her Washington living room embroidered with the words, ``If you 
haven't got anything nice to say about anyone, come and sit next to 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Things get very lonely in Washington sometimes,'' Woodrow  
Wilson told a St. Louis audience in 1919, deep into his losing 
battle to persuade the Senate to ratify American participation in 
the League of Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real voice of the great people in America sounds faint and  
distant in that strange city,'' Wilson said. ``You hear politics 
until you wish both parties were smothered in their own gas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing ever gets settled in this town,'' Secretary of State  
George Shultz told a congressional committee in 1986 during the 
furor over the Reagan administration's Iran-Contra affair and a 
dozen years before President Clinton's impeachment battle. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a seething debating society in which the debate never  
stops, in which people never give up, including me,'' Shultz said. 
``And that's the atmosphere in which you administer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The capital is a place where people can see the best and the  
worst about American society, often at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	``To Washington, central star of the constellation, may it  
enlighten the whole,'' said a hopeful and diplomatic Marquis de 
Lafayette as he toasted the city during his triumphal return visit 
to America in 1824. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look to the city of Washington and let the virtuous patriots  
of the country weep at the spectacle,'' a political pamphlet said 
the same year. ``There corruption is springing into existence and 
fast flourishing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once the 19th century city threw off its scraggly beginnings and  
became a stage for government, the leaders of Washington became 
self-absorbed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Washington talks about itself and about almost nothing else;  
it is in a positive quest of an identity of some sort,'' author 
Henry James wrote in his 1907 ``American Scene.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To this day, people keep trying to define or defame the place,  
generally in view of their own experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a town where sound travels faster than light,'' said  
Joseph Canzeri, a staffer in George Bush's White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``Washington is a pool of money, surrounded by people who want  
it,'' television newsman David Brinkley said in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	``The D.C. stands for Desperate Cases, a numerosity which  
abounds here,'' humorist Artemus Ward wrote in 1898. ``Others have 
suggested it stands for ``Deposit Cash.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Washington, said humorist Irvin Cobb, is a good place to go  
crazy because it will not be noticed. President Eisenhower is 
purported to have said the problem with Washington was that 
``everyone has been too long away from home.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Orioles To Bat Albert Belle Cleanup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Baltimore Orioles manager Ray  
Miller walked past Albert Belle on Monday and held up four fingers. 
No words were necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller has decided to bat Belle fourth in the lineup this  
season, starting with Tuesday's opening intrasquad game. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been toying with the idea of batting Belle third, though  
the temperamental slugger stated his preference last week to remain 
a cleanup hitter . 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago White Sox switched Belle to third last April and  
dropped Frank Thomas to fourth, an experiment that didn't last 
long. Both players were moved back to their usual spots after a few 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller said Belle never spoke directly to him about where he'd  
hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we had our talk after he signed, he said, `What position  
do you want me to play?' And I said, `Third or fourth,' and he 
laughed,'' Miller said. `He told me, `I'll play wherever you want 
and I'll hit wherever you want.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	``We also had a 30-minute or 40-minute conversation in my office  
about a week ago and the batting order never came up,'' Miller 
said. ``I made the decision about the third day down here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller's lineup for Tuesday has Brady Anderson batting first in  
front of Delino DeShields, who was signed as a free agent in 
December and expected to handle the leadoff duties. Although the 
arrangement could change by opening day, Miller made it clear 
Monday that he would like to keep Anderson at the top of the order 
if he's healthy and productive. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson was neither last season.  
</P>
<P>
	Roberto Alomar replaced him as the leadoff hitter after a  
strained right shoulder forced Anderson on the disabled list in 
late April. Anderson also was hindered by an inflamed tendon in his 
right knee and finished at .236, his lowest average in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	He chose not to have surgery on his knee over the winter.  
</P>
<P>
	Also influencing Miller's decision were DeShields' numbers. He's  
a .249 hitter when leading off over the past five years, compared 
to .305 when batting second.

<HEADLINE> More Original Content Found on Web </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Many newspapers and magazines are increasing the  
amount of original material on their Web sites, part of a shift 
toward using the Internet as a unique medium rather than an 
alternate distribution system. 
</P>
<P>
	In a survey being released Tuesday, 58 percent of newspapers and  
magazines had a Web site. Of those, 31 percent used original 
material for at least half their online content -- more than four 
times the number of publications that did so in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a bigger news hole and wonderful new storytelling  
tools,'' said Steve Ross, who conducted the survey. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he noted that the emphasis on round-the-clock coverage  
had its downside. 
</P>
<P>
	``Journalists often got the story wrong, concentrated on  
breaking news rather than features and skirted long-standing 
ethical practices,'' said Ross, a professor at Columbia 
University's Graduate School of Journalism. 
</P>
<P>
	As examples, he pointed to The Wall Street Journal's and The  
Dallas Morning News' retractions of online stories during the 
Monica Lewinsky scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Ross and a New York public relations firm questioned the  
business editors and managing editors of 1,420 daily newspapers and 
2,000 magazines last fall. This is the fifth year of the survey. 
</P>
<P>
	They found that although publications are developing more  
content specifically for the Web, only 18 percent routinely let 
their Web sites scoop their printed editions. Sixty-two percent 
never allowed it. 
</P>
<P>
	Ross also found that 2 percent of journalists said they had no  
access to the Internet, and only 5 percent said they never or 
almost never went online. 
</P>
<P>
	The full survey can be found Tuesday at

<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen Tuesday morning as  
new Japanese economic data continued to show a weakening economy. 
Japanese stocks turned mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.21 yen by midday, up 1.09 yen from late  
Monday in Tokyo and also above its level of 119.76 yen in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average gained 26.51 points or 0.19 percent, to  
14,248.26 points at the end of the morning session. On Monday, the 
index shed 145.79 points, or 1.01 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar advanced against the yen after  
the release of data showing Japan's jobless rate remained at a 
record-high 4.4 percent in January for the third month in a row, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of people seeking work after being forced out of  
their jobs rose by 340,000 in January from a year earlier to 1 
million -- the highest number since the government started compiling 
the data in its current form in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 130.74, down from  
130.86 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, the Nikkei edged higher as buy orders from  
overseas investors checked the unwinding of cross-shareholdings by 
Japanese companies, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the same tug-of-war pattern we have been seeing,'' said  
Kunihiro Hatae, general manager of the stock division at Tokyo 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese companies are selling shares they traditionally hold in  
other companies ahead of the end of the fiscal year on March 31, as 
keeping those shares carries fewer business relationship and 
financial benefits than in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 1.67 points, or 0.15 percent, to 1,106.14. 
On Monday, the TOPIX lost 12.22 points, or 1.09 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.865  
percent from Monday's finish of 1.840 percent, pushing the price 
down to 99.48 yen from 99.68 yen.

<HEADLINE> Racism Controversy Splits Kan. Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TURON, Kan. (AP) -- Raymond Hill is a rarity -- a recent arrival  
in this dying prarie town that has watched its population dwindle 
and storefronts boarded up. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is Hill's other distinction that has thrust him to the  
center of a local furor over racism: he is Turon's only black 
resident. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after Hill arrived from California two months ago to  
marry a local woman, pamphlets began turning up on car windshields, 
urging locals to ``send California trash back to California.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The incident prompted Mayor Charlotte Sanford to schedule a town  
meeting today featuring speakers from the FBI, the Justice 
Department and the NAACP. She also recently put forward a 
hate-crime ordinance, currently under review by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shouldn't be afraid of each other,'' said Ms. Sanford, a  
white woman who is a member of the NAACP and also blind. ``It just 
boggles my mind because I can't see skin color. I don't understand 
racism,'' she said. ``I wish everyone could see everybody like I 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The threatening pamphlets marked the third race-related incident  
in the past two years in this central Kansas farming community of 
nearly 400 residents, the shrunken remnant of a once-thriving 
community. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, the town settled a job discrimination lawsuit filed by  
a Hispanic man. Town leaders also were forced to deal with a 
threatening call made after an out-of-town group home for troubled 
youth brought some black children to the town's swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
	Darrell Pope, president of the Hutchinson chapter of the  
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said he 
believes the forum ``will be a good feeler for determining how deep 
it (racism) runs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hill, who is living at the house of Marie Hahn, his fiancee's  
grandmother, has repeatedly declined requests for interviews with 
The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Family members say privately they know who put out the  
pamphlets, and blame the whole thing on jealousy over the upcoming 
marriage. And, they say, the rest of the town has been friendly. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Hill being at the center of the town forum, Ms. Hahn  
said, ``He is a nice guy and he doesn't deserve all this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others who defend the town say Turon residents are not racist  
and blame the mayor for bringing undeserved notoriety. 
</P>
<P>
	Rolla Fetterman, a candidate for the City Council, is one of the  
leaders behind efforts to recall Ms. Sanford. 
</P>
<P>
	Fetterman, 52, has explanations for the so-called racist  
incidents: the discrimination suit was settled without proving any 
alleged racist remarks; the call about the pool came because the 
unsupervised children from the group home were supposedly gang 
members; and the fliers were probably the work of one person. 
</P>
<P>
	About 10 percent of the residents now are Hispanic, and the town  
-- about 60 miles west of Wichita -- has had several black families 
in the recent past, Fetterman said.

<HEADLINE> Turks Promise Fair Trial for Ocalan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Imprisoned Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah  
Ocalan will get a fair trial with procedures determined by law, 
Turkish Ambassador Baki Ilkin said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Western human rights groups have expressed concerns over  
Ocalan's trial on terrorism charges since one of his lawyers quit 
because of death threats and another was detained by police. 
</P>
<P>
	Ilkin told a Turkish Embassy news conference that while formal  
foreign observers would not be allowed at the trial, foreigners 
would be welcome to listen and watch if it is held in public. He 
said, however, that the judge still has the option of holding a 
closed-door trial for the Kurdistan Workers Party leader, who was 
captured by Turkish agents in Kenya two weeks ago.. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan is now being held as the sole inmate in an island prison  
awaiting trial on charges of treason in the 14-year war to win 
autonomy for Turkey's Kurds. Some 37,000 people have died in the 
fighting, and the charges against Ocalan carry a possible death 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trial procedures are determined solely by law,'' Ilkin said.  
``It is in such a framework that Ocalan will receive a fair and 
just trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No date has been announced for Ocalan's trial.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, State Department spokesman James Foley welcomed  
Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit's announcement that his 
government would take steps to prevent demonstrations threatening 
Ocalan's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkish police last week detained one of the 15 lawyers, later  
releasing him without charges, and another resigned, saying he had 
received death threats against himself and his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that Turkey understands that it's in Turkey's  
interest to create the conditions necessary for Ocalan's trial to 
be conducted in a transparent way and in accordance with its 
obligations under international human rights instruments,'' Foley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ilkin said that while foreign lawyers cannot represent Ocalan,  
there is nothing to prevent his Turkish lawyers from collaborating 
with and holding consultations with foreign lawyers outside the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he did not know what assistance, if any, the United  
States gave in Ocalan's capture in Kenya, where he had been given 
refuge in the Greek Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
	While U.S. official have lauded Ocalan's arrest, the CIA and  
other intelligence agencies have refused comment on whether they 
assisted Turkey in his capture. Other U.S. officials have said the 
United States provided critical information about Ocalan's 
whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Reflecting increased tension between Turkey and Greece, the  
ambassador said Turkish officials have strong evidence of Greek 
support for Kurdish terrorists, including their efforts to provide 
a haven for Ocalan. 
</P>
<P>
	Greece denies that it supports terrorism.

<HEADLINE> Pat Buchanan Backs Steelworkers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEIRTON, W.Va. (AP) -- Encouraged by chants of ``Go, Pat, go!''  
two-time presidential candidate Pat Buchanan made what could amount 
to a campaign promise Monday when he vowed to stand up to the 
illegal dumping of foreign-made steel on U.S. markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, who traveled later in the day to Manchester, N.H., is  
expected to announce his third bid for the presidency on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He appeared before about 1,000 steelworkers at Weirton Steel and  
their supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to be in New Hampshire and I'll be deciding whether  
it's going to be `Go, Pat, go!''' he told the cheering crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the red, white and blue ``America First'' and ``Stand Up  
for Steel'' signs were others urging the political columnist to 
seek the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, 60, shook up the Republican establishment by winning  
the New Hampshire primary in 1996. He began a leave of absence from 
CNN's ``Crossfire'' last week and is expected to visit 13 cities in 
primary states in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Weirton Steel has laid off more than 800 people and lost more  
than $13.6 million since November because of underpriced foreign 
steel that has flooded the U.S. market and undercut demand. 
</P>
<P>
	The Asian economic crisis reduced demand abroad and forced  
foreign producers to seek U.S. outlets, often by selling goods at 
prices below the production costs and prevailing U.S. levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, the U.S. Commerce Department said there is  
evidence of illegal dumping by Japan and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan called on President Clinton to enforce trade laws  
imposing quotas on foreign steelmakers.

<HEADLINE> Report: Smog Level in L.A. Unlawful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some Los Angeles-area residents could be  
breathing levels of toxic pollution hundreds of times higher than 
standards set by the federal Clean Air Act, said a congressional 
staff report released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Exposure to the 10 hazardous air pollutants measured at three  
monitors in Los Angeles and suburbs Long Beach and Burbank could 
cause as many as 426 additional cases of cancer per million exposed 
individuals, said the report, written by Democratic staff on the 
House Government Reform Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Clean Air Act standards are aimed at reducing the cancer risk  
from exposure to major sources of hazardous air pollutants to one 
in 1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The level of toxic pollutants in the air is much too high,''  
said Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., who requested the report. ``The 
report is a wake-up call that we must do a lot more to reduce toxic 
emissions, especially from cars and trucks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report's findings, however, do not mean that the city's  
residents are in any immediate danger from short-term exposure, 
Waxman said. Risk estimates are based on the assumption that 
individuals experience 70 years of exposure, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Waxman said, there is ``considerable scientific  
uncertainty associated with cancer risk estimates.'' The report 
said they are based on studies that exposed animals to high doses 
of hazardous air pollutants, and they are not an exact science. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the uncertainties, the study said many Los Angeles  
residents are breathing in excessive levels of hazardous pollutants 
even though authorities have successfully reduced air pollution in 
the area since passage in 1990 of the Clean Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the report shows is that despite this progress, we still  
have a long way to go,'' Waxman said. 
</P>
<P>
	He called the report the first to analyze levels of hazardous  
air that people breathe in the Los Angeles area or anywhere else in 
the country. Previous studies determined only the amount of 
pollution emitted by factories, motor vehicles and other sources. 
Some have argued that people do not breathe all pollution released 
into the air. 
</P>
<P>
	The South Coast Air Quality Management District began a similar  
study last year to determine cancer risks from toxic pollutants in 
neighborhoods. Initial results, due later this month, come to the 
same conclusions as the congressional report, the agency's 
executive officer, Barry Wallerstein, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears that motor vehicles create the largest portion of  
the toxic risk in terms of their emissions,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The congressional report analyzes data from pollutants monitored  
from January 1995 to April 1998. Two monitors were in residential 
areas, and the one in Burbank was in a commercial area. 
</P>
<P>
	Primary sources of the three pollutants that appeared to pose  
the greatest risks -- 1,3-butadiene, formaldehyde and benzene -- are 
mobile sources such as cars, trucks and off-road vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the levels measured in Los Angeles, the lifetime cancer  
risks for these hazardous air pollutants could be as high as 258 in 
a million for butadiene, 72 in a million for formaldehyde and 49 in 
a million for benzene,'' the report said. ``In total, nine of the 
10 hazardous air pollutants analyzed in this study appear to 
present cancer risks higher than the Clean Air Act goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 10 hazardous pollutants monitored at the three locations  
were benzene, 1,3-butadiene, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, 
chromium, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, formaldehyde, methylene chloride, 
perchloroethylene and trichloroethylene. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said 1,3-butadiene is a byproduct of combustion that  
has been found in animal studies to cause cancer in the heart, 
lungs, mammary glands, ovaries, stomach, liver, pancreas, thyroid, 
testes. 
</P>
<P>
	The report calls formaldehyde a probable human carcinogen that  
has been found to cause lung cancer in animal studies. And benzene 
is a known human carcinogen that has been found to cause leukemia 
and cancers of the lymphoid system, skin, ovary, lung and mammary 
glands.

<HEADLINE> Senate Takes Up Y2K Lawsuit Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) - With just over 300 days left before the year  
2000, Congress is taking a hard look this week at the seriousness 
of the Year 2000 computer problem and what can be done to ease 
disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting off to a rocky start, lawmakers and the administration  
clashed Monday over a proposed bill that would limit lawsuits filed 
against companies that don't fix their computers before Jan. 1, 
when the inability of many computers to read the 2000 date could 
cause economic and social disruptions and breakdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, author  
of the bill with Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said their bill 
``encourages Y2K problem-solving, rather than encouraging a rush to 
the courthouse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the administration, which has succeeded in quashing past  
efforts by the Republican-led Congress to cap punitive damages on 
product liability lawsuits, expressed concern it would limit 
consumers' rights to sue and undercut incentives to fix faulty 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our preliminary analysis indicates that this bill would be by  
far the most sweeping litigation reform measure ever enacted,'' 
said Assistant Attorney General Eleanor Acheson in testimony before 
Hatch's committee. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the full Senate takes up a much less controversial  
measure that would set aside about $500 million in Small Business 
Administration loans for businesses trying to repair their computer 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate will also release and discuss on Tuesday a major  
report on the effects of the computer bug within the United States 
and abroad. A special Senate panel on the Y2K problem chaired by 
Sens. Bob Bennett, R-Utah, and Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., concludes 
that Americans could face widespread, if generally minimal, 
disruptions in health care, financial services and food and energy 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	They say the economic and social effects could be more serious  
in many foreign countries that haven't made the effort or don't 
have the money to fix the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Also this week, House and Senate committees will have hearings  
on how well the food industry and the Pentagon are prepared for 
Y2K. President Clinton has given federal agencies until March 31 to 
make their computer systems Y2K-compatible, and the Defense 
Department is one agency that is struggling to meet that deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch's litigation bill sets aside a 90-day ``problem-solving''  
period allowing companies to remedy problems before lawsuits can be 
filed. It encourages mediation, caps punitive damages and puts some 
restrictions on class action lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has a similar bill limiting damages  
when a company makes a ``good faith'' effort to repair computers. 
His Commerce Committee is to vote on it Wednesday. Members of the 
House introduced their parallel bill last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett, testifying before the Judiciary Committee, said  
economic damage -- and lawsuits -- will occur even if Y2K-related 
problems only last a few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Critical suppliers could be bankrupted by lawsuits, he said, and  
``entire industries might be set back, causing an economic downturn 
with repercussions lasting well into the millennium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., accused the administration of  
``stonewalling this and taking nothing but the trial lawyers' 
position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What I see is a stable of salivating legal factories gearing  
up,'' said Harris Miller, president of the Information Technology 
Association of America. ``Is it prudent or responsible for Congress 
to wait for the inevitable flood or do what it can to provide 
sandbags now?'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the ranking Democrat on the  
committee, said the legislation ``has the potential to do great 
harm'' by restricting the rights of consumers, small businesses and 
the government to seek redress from computer failures. ``I sense 
that some may be seeking to use fear of the Y2K millennium bug to 
revive failed liability limitation legislation of the past.''

<HEADLINE> Lightning Near Second Sale in Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Tampa Bay Lightning owner Art Williams,  
facing financial losses and mounting frustration less than a year 
into ownership, said he has reached agreement to sell the team. 
</P>
<P>
	A sale to a group headed by Michigan billionaire William  
Davidson, which Williams outbid for the team 10 months ago, could 
take place as soon as Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do have a verbal agreement on everything,'' Williams told  
the St. Petersburg Times. ``I just don't see it breaking down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper reported the purchase price to be about $115  
million, some $2 million less than what Williams paid last year 
when he bought the debt-burdened NHL team last May. 
</P>
<P>
	Davidson owns an entertainment empire that includes the NBA's  
Detroit Pistons, the WNBA's Detroit Shock, the International Hockey 
League's Detroit Vipers, the Palace of Auburn Hills arena in 
suburban Detroit and the nearby Pine Knob Music Theater. 
</P>
<P>
	Davidson last year made a contingency-burdened offer to buy the  
Lightning from Japanese holding company Kokusai Green and was 
rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in it for the long haul,'' said Tom Wilson, president of  
the Pistons and the Davidson-owned Palace Entertainment Group. 
``We're not coming in to fail. We're coming in to make this team a 
thing Tampa can be proud of, and a benchmark franchise in the 
league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No major changes are planned in the Lightning's hockey  
operations, where Jacques Demers is coach and general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams saved the Lightning from possible bankruptcy and  
eventual collapse with his no-strings-attached bid of $117 million. 
The purchase included the Lightning's lease to the Ice Palace and a 
nearby parcel of undeveloped real estate. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams cleared the 8-year-old franchise of debt, but has  
incurred self-projected losses of up to $20 million as the 
last-place team struggled on the ice and at the gate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lightning, with a record of 13-41-5, has an average  
announced home attendance this season of 10,894 -- barely more than 
half of the Ice Palace capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had an amount in my mind that I could afford to lose over  
four, five seasons,'' Williams said, ``and I lost that amount in 
(less than) one season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former Georgia high school football coach grew weary of the  
Lightning's ineptness. Unfamiliarity with hockey only amplified his 
frustration. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a combination,'' he said, ``of losing the money, and  
losing the games, and thinking over all those months, `You know 
what? This ain't fun.'''

<HEADLINE> New Rocket Prototype Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOJAVE, Calif. (AP) -- The prototype of a reusable, manned rocket  
designed to land like a helicopter after carrying satellites into 
orbit was unveiled Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Roton, built by Rotary Rocket Co. of Redwood City, is a  
launch vehicle powered by kerosene instead of costly hydrogen, 
which the firm hopes will cut launch costs by 90 percent. It has 
been designed to launch like a rocket, then deploy a propeller and 
land like a helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 1,200 people gathered as the prototype was rolled out of a  
hangar at Mojave Airport. Among them were NASA chief engineer 
Daniel Mulville, who hopes his agency will become a customer of 
such commercial launch vehicles, and novelist Tom Clancy, a Rotary 
Rocket investor. 
</P>
<P>
	``What opened the West wasn't wagon trains, it was railroads and  
this is the railroad of the future,'' Clancy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The prototype, dubbed Roton ATV, does not have launch engines.  
It will be used to test the rocket's landing system, which uses 
rotor blades with tip rockets to slow the vehicle down so it can 
land like a helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
	The rotor blades will deploy during re-entry, and thrusters will  
be fired 500 feet above the landing site. The thrusters are 
designed to speed up the blades and make Roton hover. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests of the landing system were scheduled to begin this month.  
</P>
<P>
	A completed Roton will blast into space, release a satellite  
into low-level orbit and return the same day by summer 2000, said 
Gary Hudson, president of Rotary Rocket. 
</P>
<P>
	The craft will be flown by two pilots, the first astronauts  
aboard a privately developed space vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Rotary Rocket hopes the vehicle will lower the cost of putting  
the satellite in space from $10,000 to about $1,000 a pound. The 
company receives no government funding and plans to finish the $130 
million project with money raised from investors.

<HEADLINE> 5 Die in Strep Outbreak in Illinois </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AURORA, Ill. (AP) -- A deadly form of strep bacteria has infected  
11 people in the Chicago area, killing five of them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Illinois Health Department and the U.S. Centers for Disease  
Control and Prevention are investigating to find the source of the 
strep A infections and learn whether the cases were related, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC says about 10,000 to 15,000 people in the United States  
develop the illness each year, and about 2,000 die. 
</P>
<P>
	The most recent case, involving an elderly Aurora man, was  
diagnosed Friday, Kane County Medical Director Dr. David Lucks said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Strep A can cause a range of illnesses from a mild sore throat  
to life-threatening diseases. It is generally treated with 
antibiotics. Symptoms include a sore throat, high fever, chills and 
painful swelling of the joints and limbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Robert Tiballi, a physician who treated several of the  
victims, urged anyone with symptoms to see a physician quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't delay getting evaluated. People should not believe they  
have the flu and that this will just go away,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Interest Rates Rise in Auction / T-Bills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury  
securities rose in Monday's auction to the highest level in more 
than five months. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department sold $7.51 billion in three-month bills  
at a discount rate of 4.570 percent, up from 4.530 percent last 
week. An additional $7.5 billion was sold in six-month bills at a 
rate of 4.585 percent, up from 4.430 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates were the highest since Sept. 21, when three-month  
bills sold for 4.635 percent and the six-month rate was 4.615 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors  
-- 4.700 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,884.50 and 4.772 percent for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,768.20. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the  
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index 
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 4.82 
percent last week from 4.71 percent the previous week.

<HEADLINE> Spider-Man Can Now Appear in Films </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- After spending years snared in a complicated  
legal web, the comic book superhero Spider-Man is now free to star 
in his first feature film, the result of a Superior Court 
settlement announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the week trial was set to begin, Sony Pictures Entertainment  
and comic book publisher Marvel Enterprises Inc. signed an 
agreement to launch a movie franchise featuring one of the most 
prized characters never to appear on film. 
</P>
<P>
	``We couldn't be happier -- at long last -- to bring this popular  
character to the big screen to the delight of audience around the 
world,'' said Amy Pascal, president of Sony's Columbia Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no announcement on when a movie project would begin.  
</P>
<P>
	The Spider-Man character was created by famed Marvel comic book  
artist Stan Lee in 1962, entering the world as ``The Amazing 
Spider-Man.'' Spider-Man is really teen-ager Peter Parker, who got 
his powers when bitten by a radioactive spider. 
</P>
<P>
	Spider-Man comics have been huge sellers, and the hero has been  
the basis of a newspaper comic strip and animated and live-action 
TV series, but never a feature film. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, studios have been eager to make a Spider-Man movie to  
share in some of the success of the Batman and Superman films. At 
one point, ``Titanic'' director James Cameron had been recruited to 
write and direct a Spider-Man film. 
</P>
<P>
	But Spider-Man has been kept off the screen because of more than  
a decade of business problems, including bankruptcies of at least 
three companies linked to the character, and competing claims in 
court to the rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The years of lawsuits and counter-lawsuits now before Superior  
Court Judge Aurelio Munoz have generated 60 boxes of court 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement resolves competing lawsuits by Marvel and Sony.  
It also settles claims by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which had contended 
it had acquired the rights from a number of now-defunct film 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, MGM suffered a setback when a judge rejected those  
claims. MGM had said it would appeal. An MGM spokesman declined to 
comment other than to confirm MGM had resolved its disputes in the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement doesn't affect claims by yet another litigant,  
Viacom Inc., which are still scheduled for trial this week. Viacom 
contends it holds the television distribution rights to any 
Spider-Man movie. Viacom officials didn't return a message seeking 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement was a major boost for Marvel Enterprises, which  
also is involved in licensing and toys. The company was formed last 
October after Marvel Entertainment Group emerged from bankruptcy 
and combined with Toy Biz Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great day for us,'' Marvel Enterprises president and  
chief executive Eric Ellenbogen said in an interview. ``The last 
vestiges of bankruptcy and previous entanglements are now gone. The 
company is totally freed. And it's most important property is now 
going to become a major motion picture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, another battle between Sony and MGM continues over  
another famous character. 
</P>
<P>
	A trial is set for next month over the rights to the lucrative  
James Bond movie franchise. Last week, a federal judge rejected 
MGM's motion for summary judgment in the fight with Sony. Bond 
movies are about the only moneymakers for the struggling MGM, which 
plans to release the latest installment of the Bond series -- No. 19 
-- in November with Pierce Brosnan again as 007.

<HEADLINE> Brooks' Day at Spring Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- Here's how it went for Garth Brooks on  
Monday at spring training for the San Diego Padres: 
</P>
<P>
	 *COUNTRY CAMPER:* Brooks took part in hitting and fielding  
drills in preparation for the Padres first intrasquad scrimmage 
Tuesday. Brooks, battling tendinitis in his right (throwing) 
shoulder, will be restricted to a designated hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	 *HIGH NOTE:* Brooks hit one home run during batting practice for  
the third consecutive day. Brooks was one of only three players on 
the Padres spring training roster who didn't have his picture taken 
for photo day. 
</P>
<P>
	 *ON THE RECORD:* ``You can go through all the fundamentals you  
want, take all the batting practice, but once you cross that line, 
that's when he's going to find out that the game can go pretty fast 
at times. That pitcher's throwing pretty hard out there, mixing up 
pitches, and you don't know what's coming next.'' -- Padres manager 
Bruce Bochy.

<HEADLINE> UGI To Buy Unisource </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERWYN, Pa. (AP) -- UGI Corp., a major distributor of propane  
gas, is buying Unisource Worldwide Inc., a distributor of printing 
and imaging products and packaging systems. 
</P>
<P>
	UGI, which is based in Valley Forge, includes AmeriGas Inc., the  
majority shareholder of AmeriGas Partners LP, the largest propane 
marketer in the U.S.; UGI Utilities Inc., a natural-gas and 
electric utility serving eastern Pennsylvania; and UGI Enterprises 
Inc., a supplier of energy services. 
</P>
<P>
	Unisource Worldwide of Berwyn is North America's largest  
distributor of printing and imaging products, packaging systems and 
sanitary-maintenance supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the closing value of UGI's shares on Friday, before the  
deal was announced, the deal would be worth about $815 million. 
</P>
<P>
	UGI's stock tumbled on the New York Stock Exchange Monday,  
partially on news that the company will cut its annual dividend to 
75 cents from $1.46. UGI shares fell $4.37 1/2, or 22 percent, to 
close at $15.93 3/4. Unisource shares rose $1 to $8, also on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	Unisource and UGI's units will operate as units of the holding  
company UGI, which will be given a new name. The combined company 
will have $8.8 billion in distribution revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	In conjunction with its merger, UGI said it will sell UGI  
Utilities, its regulated gas and electric utility.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Goes With Youth for U.S. Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- U.S. soccer coach Bruce Arena selected a mostly  
inexperienced roster for games against Guatemala and Mexico in the 
U.S. Cup '99 tournament this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven of the 22 players have five games or fewer of  
international experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than goalkeepers Kasey Keller and Tony Meola, the only  
players with substantial international playing time are defenders 
Jeff Agoos, Robin Fraser and Eddie Pope; midfielders Cobi Jones, 
Jovan Kirovski and Claudio Reyna; and forwards Brian McBride and 
Joe-Max Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	Recalled from abroad were Keller (England); defender David Regis  
(France) and three German-based midfielders -- Kirovski, Reyna and 
Tony Sanneh. 
</P>
<P>
	Arena picked five players from D.C. United, his former team in  
Major League Soccer: Agoos, defender Carlos Llamosa, midfielder Ben 
Olsen, Pope and midfielder Richie Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, coming off a last-place finish among the 32  
nations at last summer's World Cup, is 2-0-2 since Arena replaced 
Steve Sampson. Following scoreless ties against Australia and 
Bolivia, the Americans beat Germany 3-0 and Chile 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the reduced U.S. Cup tournament, which is now  
sponsored by Nike, the Americans play Guatemala on March 11 at Los 
Angeles and Mexico on March 13 at San Diego. In previous years, 
each team played three games in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The full roster:  
</P>
<P>
	Goalkeeper--Kasey Keller (Leicester City, England), Tony Meola  
(Kansas City) 
</P>
<P>
	Defenders--Jeff Agoos (D.C.), C.J. Brown (Chicago), Leo Cullen  
(Miami), Robin Fraser (Los Angeles), Carlos Llamosa (D.C.), Eddie 
Pope (D.C.), David Regis (Metz, France) 
</P>
<P>
	Midfielders--Chris Armas (Chicago), Cobi Jones (Los Angeles),  
Jovan Kirovski (Fortuna Cologne, Germany), Eddie Lewis (San Jose), 
Brian Maisonneuve (Columbus), Clint Mathis (Los Angeles), Ben Olsen 
(D.C.), Claudio Reyna (VfL Wolfsburg, Germany), Tony Sanneh (Hertha 
Berlin, Germany), Richie Williams (D.C.)

<HEADLINE> Giants' Bonds Returns to Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- San Francisco Giants left fielder Barry  
Bonds was back at work Monday after missing most of workouts Sunday 
because of spasms in his lower back. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds took turns in the batting cage, hitting line drives into  
the outfield. Once, when a ball caromed off the top of the cage he 
groaned -- but it seemed more out of dissatisfaction than pain. 
</P>
<P>
	He felt the spasm during a running drill early Sunday, and fell  
to his knees. He later consulted with team physician Dr. William 
Montgomery and chiropractor Alan Parker. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I'll take one more day off. But I don't think it's a big  
deal,'' Bonds told the San Francisco Examiner as he left Scottsdale 
Stadium on Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday morning, Bonds was dressed and ready in the stadium  
clubhouse, before the Giants left for their training facility at 
Indian School Park. He would not comment on the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was cleared to join the team,'' team trainer Mark Letendre  
said. ``He's vastly improved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is the third consecutive spring training that Bonds has had  
trouble with his back. Two years ago, he hurt himself falling down 
some stairs at home and saw a chiropractor during the season. Last 
year, he also reported a stiff back. 
</P>
<P>
 *NOTES:* The Giants aren't in any rush to give the exclusively 
left-handed hitting J.T. Snow a look at left-handed pitching. Snow, 
a former switch-hitter who decided to hit only from the left this 
year, has faced only righties so far in batting practice this 
spring. The plan is to eventually put Snow up against left-handers. 
... The Giants signed pitcher Chris Brock and infielder Wilson 
Delgado to one-year contracts. ... San Francisco opens its spring 
season Friday against Milwaukee. Dusty Baker's rotation for Cactus 
League Games will be Mark Gardner, Kirk Rueter, Russ Ortiz and 
Shawn Estes.

<HEADLINE> Pavarotti Seeks His Own Opera </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- After spending his career performing roles  
written for others, Luciano Pavarotti would like someone to compose 
an opera with him in mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been my dream of 20 years or more that a pop composer  
would put himself together with a classical composer and make an 
opera,'' the tenor said backstage while rehearsing for a Sunday 
appearance with the Columbus Symphony Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one is writing music for someone like me today,'' Pavarotti  
said, describing himself as ``someone very romantic, someone who 
likes melody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Being a composer of opera today, one has to write dissonant  
music or one is considered antique. That is why I like to sing with 
pop singers,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he got tired of performing the same repertoire,  
Pavarotti said, ``It is always a live performance. It is always 
risky. But on top of singing, which is a joy, they pay you for 
it.''

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Farmers Stage 'Tractorcade' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- About 500 tractors snarled downtown traffic  
Monday in a demonstration by tobacco farmers demanding at least 
half of North Carolina's $4.6 billion share of a settlement between 
cigarette makers and 46 states. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not want to see one more tobacco farmer put out of  
business as the result of this attempt at prohibition of tobacco 
products by politicians and lawyers,'' said farmer Jimmy Lee, who 
helped organize the ``tractorcade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco farmers are upset by the prospect that their livelihood  
will be threatened by the $206 billion settlement reached by the 
tobacco industry and the states late last year. The deal, which 
would reimburse state governments for the cost of treating 
tobacco-related illnesses, also aims at discouraging people from 
smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Carolina farmers, who had a parade permit for the  
protest, began the demonstration around 9 a.m., with the tractors 
making their way from the State Fairgrounds past the state Capitol 
and the Governor's Mansion about five miles away. At least one 
tractor had a farmer hanging from it in effigy. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're hot. They don't feel like they've been heard in the  
negotiations,'' said state Rep. Leslie Cox, who represents a 
tobacco-growing district and received the farmers' demands. 
``They've had no place at the table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers are expected to begin debating soon how to spend the  
$4.6 billion, the state's allotment of the $206 billion settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Cigarette companies have pledged to give an additional $2  
billion to help North Carolina farmers and communities that depend 
on tobacco. The money is part of a $5.15 billion trust fund the 
tobacco industry agreed to set up. 
</P>
<P>
	But farmers say they want their livelihoods secured with money  
from the original settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``This whole thing today is not about money. It's about  
security,'' Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
	One plan before the state General Assembly would establish a  
charitable foundation to use half of the original settlement money 
to help tobacco-dependent communities. The other half, lawmakers 
said, likely would be used for public health programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox said he thinks the charitable foundation probably is the  
right way to handle the settlement money. But he said more effort 
must be made to explain to farmers how it will work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard the explanation about three times and I  
half-understand how it will work,'' Cox said. ``It's no surprise 
that people who haven't heard the explanation at all would be 
concerned about it.''

<HEADLINE> Wagner Fires Coach After 10 Seasons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tim Capstraw, who compiled a 117-164 record in  
10 years at Wagner College, was fired Monday following his fifth 
straight losing season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks were 9-18 this season, losing 63-56 to  
Maryland-Baltimore County last Friday in the quarterfinals of the 
Northeast Conference tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Capstraw, a 1982 graduate of Wagner, was the youngest Division I  
coach in the nation when he was hired by his alma mater for the 
1989-90 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hardest thing I've ever done in this job,'' Wagner  
athletic director Walt Hameline said of the firing. ``Timmy's all 
class and that's the way he left which is no surprise to anyone who 
knows him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Capstraw's best season was 1992-93 when the Seahawks were 18-12  
and lost 65-64 on a buzzer-beater to Rider in the conference 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sad but not stunned,'' Capstraw said. ``I have always and  
will love Wagner. Now I'll just turn around and evaluate what I'll 
do next.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Capstraw was an assistant at Wagner for four seasons and at  
Siena for another four before becoming a head coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Hameline said a search for a successor would begin immediately.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Offers Advice to IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund should be  
strengthened so it can respond more quickly when economic troubles 
in one country threaten to spread around the world, Japanese 
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said today. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech delivered on his behalf to a World Bank symposium in  
Tokyo, Miyazawa criticized the way the IMF has handled the Asian 
economic crisis, saying the multinational lender's policies are 
outdated. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's top finance official accused the IMF of failing to adapt  
its prescriptions for repairing economies to changes in the 
international financial system. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the recent economic problems have been caused by the  
increasing ease with which money flows across borders, he said in a 
speech read by State Secretary for Finance Sadakazu Tanigaki. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IMF, which was established in the days of limited capital  
flows, has not fully attuned itself to addressing this type of 
crisis,'' Miyazawa said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF should be revamped so it can speed emergency loans to  
countries as soon as signs of economic trouble develop, he 
proposed. To speed response time, IMF officials should continuously 
monitor capital flows around the world and financial conditions in 
member countries, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Asian economic crisis has plunged economies in the region  
into recession, left millions jobless and triggered riots and 
social unrest since it began a year and a half ago. The turmoil has 
since spread to Russia and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance leaders from around the world gathered at the symposium  
today to talk about steps they could take to keep the next crisis 
from doing so much damage. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF Deputy Managing Director Stanley Fischer, who also attended  
the symposium, said Japan's efforts to fix its economy should help 
the country and the region recover. 
</P>
<P>
	Tax cuts and spending increases designed to stimulate growth and  
measures to repair the ailing banking system ``should ensure a 
strong comeback for the Japanese economy,'' Fischer said in a 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
	And because it accounts for two-thirds of the Asian economy, a  
recovery in Japan would lift the entire region, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese Finance Minister Eisuke Sakakibara predicted the  
economy would begin to recover around the middle of 1999, saying 
the ``financial crisis is over, or almost over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bad loan problems at Japanese banks have weighed heavily on the  
economy here and curtailed growth throughout the region.

<HEADLINE> Linda Tripp To Return to Pentagon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Under criminal investigation in Maryland,  
Linda Tripp is returning to the Pentagon to a different job than 
the one she had a year ago when her secret tape-recordings 
triggered the Monica Lewinsky scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp will be a public affairs specialist in the Defense  
Department's Manpower Data Center, two people familiar with the 
matter said Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp was informed of the change Monday at the Pentagon in  
a meeting with her supervisor, Doug Wilson, the principal deputy 
assistant secretary of defense for public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Army Col. Richard Bridges, the Pentagon's director of defense  
information, confirmed the meeting, but said he had no other 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Coughter, a spokesman for Mrs. Tripp, declined to  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Until her tapes launched the probe of President Clinton, Mrs.  
Tripp was director of the high-profile Joint Civilian Orientation 
Conference. The program for the secretary of defense brought 
together opinion leaders from across the nation to familiarize them 
with activities of all the military services. 
</P>
<P>
	Working from home since the scandal erupted, the 19-year federal  
employee has had a difficult relationship with her employer, 
declaring she wanted to remain at her work station at the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon concluded her presence would be disruptive to the  
Defense Department, so she was assigned to put together a training 
manual from home. She worked in the White House during the Bush and 
early years of the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp's tape-recorded phone calls of Ms. Lewinsky  
discussing a planned cover-up of her affair with Clinton are the 
focal point of a probe by a Maryland prosecutor of whether she 
broke the state wiretapping law. 
</P>
<P>
	She says the probe is politically motivated.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp's federal immunity from prosecution from independent  
counsel Kenneth Starr may not save her from the Maryland 
prosecutor, who is gathering evidence independent of the tapes and 
her sworn testimony to Starr.

<HEADLINE> Independent Counsel Options Mulled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With both political parties having been burned  
by special prosecutors, the Independent Counsel Act almost 
certainly will be allowed to die this year, key senators say. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it is fixable,'' Senate Democratic leader Tom  
Daschle of South Dakota said Sunday on ABC's ``This Week.'' ``The 
time has come for us to close the books and try to find another way 
within the Justice Department itself to handle these 
responsibilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The law was enacted in 1978 in the wake of the Watergate  
scandal. It gives outside prosecutors the freedom to investigate 
government wrongdoing without concern of interference from the 
president or the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is almost no sentiment for renewing the law when its  
authority expires June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans held up reauthorization for 18 months in 1992  
because of anger over Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh's long and 
expensive inquiry into the Iran-Contra affair. Democrats now say 
that Kenneth Starr's extended pursuit of President Clinton shows 
the law is not working. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ken Starr has demonstrated the excesses and the extreme to  
which an independent counsel can go unless you have limits on that 
work,'' said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., an author of the 1978 law. 
</P>
<P>
	House and Senate committees plan hearings this week on the act.  
</P>
<P>
	Senators from both parties said Sunday that the ultimate  
solution might be to return investigative authority to the Justice 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``For 180 years, we had a good system. It can work. It can work  
again. We don't need this independent counsel statute,'' Sen. 
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dodd said the old system worked even when President Nixon fired  
special counsel Archibald Cox in 1973 because of his probe into 
Watergate. Cox was succeeded by another Justice Department special 
counsel, Leon Jaworski, who won 39 convictions on 45 indictments, 
Dodd said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Governmental  
Affairs Committee that oversees the Independent Counsel Act, said 
the problem was not with Starr but with a law that has failed to 
balance independence with accountability. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm beginning to think it would be better to put it back in  
Justice, demand more accountability, bring in these special 
counsels when the situation calls for it,'' he said on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	Levin, the ranking Democrat on Thompson's committee, also said  
Congress may have to look at a way to keep investigations within 
the Justice Department without sacrificing independence ``so that 
we can have that kind of public confidence without having the 
abuses we've seen over the years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dodd said the 20 independent counsels appointed under the act  
have spent some $150 million and two-thirds of their investigations 
have not led to any indictments. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said on CNN's ``Late  
Edition'' that Democrats should not rush to kill the act because of 
their distaste for the Starr investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the six special prosecutors appointed by presidents through  
Nixon, three were fired and ``the system came close to a collapse'' 
when Nixon fired Cox, he said.

<HEADLINE> Blacks Launch Boycott in N.C. Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.C. (AP) -- Black residents have launched a week-long  
boycott of local businesses because the Town Council won't annex 
outlying black areas and the mayor says blacks shouldn't run local 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got to put some pressure somewhere,'' organizer Walter  
Robinson said. ``If we're not accepted in the town, we'll stop 
using stuff in the town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Joffree Leggett told a newspaper last week that he and the  
council opposed annexing black areas because they do not want 
blacks to take over town government. 
</P>
<P>
	Trenton, a community of 200, has 23 black residents. Three  
adjacent unincorporated areas are predominantly black. 
</P>
<P>
	Leggett said last week that if three blacks worked in a store  
together, ``within a few years they'd be stealing from each other, 
and they'd be out of business. They're not leaders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He later said he was referring to three blacks like one of the  
six plaintiffs in a federal lawsuit accusing the town of racist 
annexation policies, but stood by the rest of the statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The state National Association for the Advancement of Colored  
People chapter is calling for Leggett's resignation, but Leggett 
has said he will not resign.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Drug Certification Likely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some congressional critics of President  
Clinton's certification of Mexico as an ally in the drug war are 
moving to formally challenge the decision. But they seem unlikely 
to muster the votes needed, and some are conceding it could be an 
exercise in futility. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly there are not the votes to succeed with a challenge,  
and having a divisive battle on the floor makes no sense,'' Sen. 
Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Feinstein was a leader in the 1998 effort to block the annual  
certification of Mexico as an anti-drug partner, but says she won't 
challenge the president this year, even though she still has 
serious reservations about his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the vocal criticism of the president's move is coming  
from the House side. 
</P>
<P>
	House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., said, ``Mexico has  
not done enough to meet the requirements of our law.'' And Rep. 
Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., chairman of the House International 
Relations Committee, called Mexico's record ``dismal'' and said 
Clinton's certification ``cannot stand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reps. Spencer Bachus, R-Ala., and Clay Shaw, R-Fla., were  
expected to introduce a decertification resolution today. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John L. Mica, R-Fla., chairman of the Government Reform  
subcommittee on counternarcotics, scheduled a hearing for Thursday 
and said he believed the decertification resolution would draw 
substantial support. 
</P>
<P>
	``In terms of cooperation, we get a big fat zero from Mexico on  
specifics,'' Mica said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	But congressional leadership aides said it seemed doubtful the  
resolution could win a majority in both chambers, let alone the 
two-thirds that would be needed to override a near-certain veto. 
Congress has 30 days, until April 1, to act. 
</P>
<P>
	In its annual review of 28 countries that produce or serve as  
conduits for illegal drugs, the administration on Friday cited only 
two -- Burma and Afghanistan -- for not fully cooperating in 
counternarcotics efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	By law, countries found not to be fully cooperative are  
decertified and can be subject to economic sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of the decision claim Mexico has an abysmal record in  
fighting drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
	But both Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and House  
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., have hinted they don't plan to make 
a major effort to block the certification. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not even on my radar screen,'' said John Czwartacki, a  
spokesman for Lott. Even so, he said, ``options are being mulled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Mica said the speaker ``has asked us to do a thorough  
review'' and he did not think Hastert was ``closed to 
decertification.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, the opposition is more muted.  
</P>
<P>
	A bipartisan group of eight senators, led by Sen. Charles E.  
Grassley, R-Iowa, sent a letter to Clinton requesting that the 
process for measuring Mexico's progress be reviewed -- and that next 
year's decision be tied to specific accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government of Mexico has taken steps to improve its law  
enforcement cooperation,'' the letter said. ``But far more, we 
believe, needs to be done.'' Feinstein and Sen. Paul Coverdell, 
R-Ga., who last year led the effort to overturn the certification, 
were among those who signed the generally conciliatory letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Coverdell is the chairman of a U.S.-Mexico legislative  
conference in Atlanta this spring. Congressional aides suggested he 
does not want to anger the Mexicans by actively pressing for drug 
decertification at this time.

<HEADLINE> Recommendations Made on IOC Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A special IOC panel has issued recommendations on  
whether to impose sanctions against the 13 members still under 
investigation in the Salt Lake City scandal, a commission member 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacques Rogge, a member of the six-man inquiry panel that met in  
Switzerland during the weekend, said the group sent its findings to 
International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch 
and the executive board. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a recommendation that was given to the president to  
be forwarded to members of the executive board,'' Rogge said by 
telephone from Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said he didn't know when the board would convene to act on  
the panel's report. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's in the hands of the president,'' he said. ``I guess he  
will contact the members of the executive board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have indicated the board could speak by conference  
call this week to deal with the final cases of alleged misconduct 
stemming from Salt Lake's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The inquiry commission can recommend that members be expelled,  
exonerated or warned. If accepted by the board, the proposals will 
go to the full IOC session at a special general assembly March 
17-18. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine IOC members have already resigned or been ousted in  
connection with cash payments, scholarships, free medical care and 
other inducements offered by Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Some officials said the board needs to act swiftly to exonerate  
any delegates found innocent of wrongdoing and to give those facing 
expulsion time to prepare their defense for the session. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of the inquiry panel, IOC vice president Dick Pound,  
said Sunday the work was not completed and said he hoped the 
inquiry panel would wrap up the investigation in a few days. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to complete the stuff we're working on, the report,  
sometime in the next week,'' Pound said. ``We've got to let these 
folks know what's going on before the next session. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to stop the bleeding by March 17,'' he said. ``Death  
by 1,000 cuts isn't much fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After nine members resigned or were suspended in January in the  
first round of Pound's inquiry, the weekend meeting focused on 
three that remained under investigation and 10 new names that 
appeared in the Salt Lake report. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Coles of Australia, Ashwini Kumar of India and Agustin  
Arroyo of Ecuador traveled to IOC headquarters to defend 
themselves. Tight security prevented checks to see if others were 
present and Pound declined to say how many had shown up. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the higher-profile cases was that of Kim Un-yong, the  
executive board member from South Korea and president of the 
confederation of Olympic sports bodies. He is accused of using his 
influence to get lucrative jobs in television and entertainment for 
his children. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, one of the most influential sports officials involved in  
the 2000 Sydney Olympics, was with the commission for about one 
hour but refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Australian was linked with lavish travel and vacations  
allegedly paid for by Salt Lake City bidders and has threatened 
legal action to clear his name. 
</P>
<P>
	In Australia, IOC executive board member Kevan Gosper said he  
was surprised at the extent of the allegations against Coles but 
did not think he would face expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper did, however, call on Coles to explain his actions to the  
Australian public. 
</P>
<P>
	``Phil will have to address the criticisms being aimed at him in  
Australia,'' Gosper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake report alleged that Kumar was given a plane ticket  
to travel to the IOC meeting in Hungary. The 2002 Winter Games were 
awarded to Salt Lake at that meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't receive any ticket,'' said Kumar. He said that while  
the ticket receipt in the Salt Lake report bore the name Kumar, the 
first name was different. 
</P>

	Arroyo, a 30-year member of the IOC, said he'd chosen to plead  
his case in person because he was ``not at all satisfied'' with the 
committee's decision to suspend him and recommend his expulsion 
after the first phase of the investigation in January. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lot of wrong information from Salt Lake City. I  
don't like to use the word lie ... I just say it's not true,'' said 
the 75-year-old IOC veteran. 
</P>
<P>
	Arroyo was accused of accepting $19,000 in payments from Salt  
Lake bidders for himself and a family member, in addition to 
generous travel expenses for visits. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel also was expected to examine files from about a dozen  
cities that bid for the Olympics between 1996 and 2004. The IOC had 
asked the cities to give details of any wrongdoing by IOC members 
during their bids.

<HEADLINE> Jerry Springer Cries a River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The tables were turned on Jerry Springer when he  
was reduced to tears Monday during an interview on a British talk 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	Springer, who is accustomed to seeing his talk-show guests  
pushed to their emotional limits, dabbed away tears after watching 
video footage of his boyhood home in London during an interview on 
``This Morning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Wow, they've taken great care of it,'' Springer said after the  
hosts surprised him with the footage. 
</P>
<P>
	A video crew visited the modest flat where Springer lived until  
age 5, when his family moved to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Springer is in Britain as part of a promotional tour for ``The  
Jerry Springer Show.'' He is scheduled to speak at Oxford 
University on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Gov't OKs Flight Services Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department approved the nation's  
largest flight support services company's move to acquire a 
competitor after it agreed Monday to sell operations at airports in 
Palm Springs, Calif.; Hartford, Conn., and Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, which must still be approved by a federal judge,  
would allow Signature Flight Support Corp. to acquire AMR Combs 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Signature, based in Orlando, Fla., owns the nation's largest  
network of fixed flight base operations, with more than 40 
locations nationwide. AMR Combs is a subsidiary of AMR Corp. of 
Dallas, which also owns American Airlines. AMR Combs has 11 fixed 
base operations in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	In a lawsuit to block the original deal, the government argued  
that it would reduce competition and would likely push up prices 
for aviation services at the three airports. 
</P>
<P>
	To overcome those concerns, Signature agreed to sell flight  
support businesses at Palm Springs Regional Airport in California, 
Bradley International in Hartford and Denver Centennial Airport. 
The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court here along with the 
agreement designed to settle it. 
</P>
<P>
	Signature and Combs currently are the only two companies  
competing to sell such services as fueling and ramp and hangar 
space rentals at Palm Springs and Bradley. At Denver Centennial, 
Signature previously agreed to operate a flight support facility 
which would have competed with Combs when it is completed next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without these divestitures, aviation customers at Palm Springs  
and Bradley International Airport would have had to pay higher 
prices for jet fuel and other services,'' said Assistant Attorney 
General Joel I. Klein, head of Justice's antitrust division. 
``Customers at Denver Centennial Airport would not have experienced 
the benefits that competition from a third independent fixed based 
operator would bring to that airport.''

<HEADLINE> Brits Love 'Shakespeare in Love' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- There's no doubt the British love their Bard:  
``Shakespeare In Love'' dominated the nominations Monday for the 
51st British Academy of Film and Television Arts awards, earning 15 
citations. 
</P>
<P>
	The nominations include best picture, best director for John  
Madden, best actor for Joseph Fiennes, and best actress for Gwyneth 
Paltrow. 
</P>
<P>
	The romantic comedy -- which is up for 13 Oscar nominations as  
well -- competes for best film against another period saga, the far 
more grim and violent ``Elizabeth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Elizabeth,'' starring Australian actress Cate Blanchett, is up  
for 12 awards, called ``Baftas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The winners will be announced April 11.  
</P>
<P>
	Oscar front-runner ``Saving Private Ryan'' is competing for 10  
Baftas, including best picture, best director for Steven Spielberg, 
and best actor for Tom Hanks. 
</P>
<P>
	Others in the race for best picture include by director Peter  
Weir's darkly satiric ``The Truman Show,'' which was unexpectedly 
shut out of the Oscar race for the top prize. 
</P>
<P>
	``Little Voice'' stars Jane Horrocks and Michael Caine were  
nominated for best actress and best actor despite being neglected 
in the Oscar line-up. Oscar nominee Brenda Blethyn was also up for 
a Bafta award for her supporting performance in the same film. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynn Redgrave was a nominee for best supporting actress for  
``Gods and Monsters,'' but the film's leading man -- Oscar nominee 
Sir Ian McKellen -- was not named. 
</P>
<P>
	Doubling his chances of winning, Australian actor Geoffrey Rush  
will compete against himself in the category of supporting actor, 
having been nominated for his performances in both ``Elizabeth'' 
and ``Shakespeare In Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In some ways, the tightest Bafta race is for outstanding British  
film of the year. The six nominees in that category are 
``Elizabeth,'' ``Hilary and Jackie,'' ``Little Voice,'' ``My Name 
Is Joe,'' ``Sliding Doors,'' and ``Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking 
Barrels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Emily Watson is a best actress nominee for her anguished  
portrayal of cellist Jacqueline du Pre in the controversial 
``Hilary and Jackie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nominated for best foreign film are ``Central Station,'' from  
Brazil; ``Life Is Beautiful,'' from Italy; ``Le Bossu,'' from 
France; and ``Live Flesh,'' from Spain.

<HEADLINE>  Martin Unsure Why Pirates Kept Him </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) -- Barry Bonds, Doug Drabek and Andy Van  
Slyke left. Al Martin stayed. Jay Bell and Jeff King left. Al 
Martin stayed. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Giles and Brant Brown arrived. Still, Al Martin stayed.  
</P>
<P>
	The Pittsburgh Pirates, struggling to stay competitive even as  
rival franchises spend four times as much money on players as they 
do, have undergone four major roster transformations since Martin 
arrived in 1992. He has outlasted every one, even if he wasn't 
always certain why. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last week, Martin was within minutes of being dealt to  
Arizona until Diamondbacks outfielder Bernard Gilkey 
short-circuited the trade by declining to approve minor contract 
language. 
</P>
<P>
	Before that, there was the rumored trade with San Diego and the  
supposedly done deal with Seattle and ... 
</P>
<P>
	``We keep going through team after team after team, and  
everything keeps changing -- except me,'' said Martin, a career .280 
hitter who began spring training as one of the Pirates' two 
starting left fielders. 
</P>
<P>
	Two starting left fielders? Back to that in a moment.  
</P>
<P>
	Martin isn't certain why he survived the latest makeover, a  
dramatic offseason roster reshuffling by general manager Cam 
Bonifay that could see the Pirates open the season with six new 
starters in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, Martin is coming off a career-low .239 season -- ``It  
was the worst year of my life, from the first day of spring 
training until the end,'' he says -- and is the Pirates' 
highest-paid player at $2.7 million. And the Pirates clearly didn't 
trade for former Cleveland outfielder Brian Giles to sit him on the 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to get him 500 at-bats,'' manager Gene Lamont said.  
</P>
<P>
	So where does that leave Al Martin? On the bench? In left field?  
In right field? In limbo? 
</P>
<P>
	Martin doesn't know -- and, it would appear, the Pirates don't,  
either. Martin keeps getting mixed signals: One day he's told the 
outfield is set and he's not in it, the next day he hears he's 
still the left fielder. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard most likely I'm not going to start, I've heard for  
sure I'm going to start,'' Martin said Monday. ``There's some 
quirky stuff going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All this indecision about what to do about Al is creating  
speculation among the Pirates players that Bonifay is not yet done 
dealing, even after acquiring Giles, outfielder Brant Brown, third 
baseman Ed Sprague, shortstop Pat Meares, second baseman Mike 
Benjamin and left-hander Pete Schourek. 
</P>
<P>
	One possibility is that Martin is dealt for a prospect or two --  
just as second baseman Tony Womack was Friday -- to a team that 
decides late in spring training it still needs another bat or one 
more outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
	Another possibility: the Pirates deal first baseman Kevin Young,  
who is in the final year of his contract, to a contending team, 
Brown moves from center field to first base, Giles switches from 
left to center and Martin is the left fielder, as usual. 
</P>
<P>
	Whew.  
</P>
<P>
	``But you know what? I can't worry about it any longer,'' said  
Martin, who admittedly lost his concentration and intensity as the 
Pirates lost 93 games last season. ``I think I put too much stock 
into worrying about other people's decisions and it kind of took me 
on a roller coaster ride. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I can control is how I play, and I'm going to  
go out and play well, whether it's in Pittsburgh or somewhere else. 
I know I had a terrible year last year, but I am refocused and I'm 
going to have a huge year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If nothing else, his dreadful 1998 season -- his first in the  
majors in which he hit less than .281 -- has motivated the 
31-year-old Martin never to repeat it. Martin came into camp late 
week with renewed enthusiasm, and Lamont said he's never seen him 
hit so well early in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fallout that continued after last year, that I'm washed up  
and done and never did anything, that never hurt me,'' Martin said. 
``I think everybody is going to have a bad year every once in a 
while. If I have only one bad year every 5-6 years, I'll take 
that.''

<HEADLINE> Rijo's Baseball Academy Almost Done </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Once Jose Rijo's baseball academy in the  
Dominican Republic is complete, he intends to try to resurrect his 
baseball career one more time. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite nearly four years of elbow operations and comeback  
attempts, Rijo isn't ready to retire. He said Monday that he hopes 
to sign another minor league contract with the Cincinnati Reds in a 
few weeks, once he's done supervising construction on the academy. 
</P>
<P>
	Rijo, 33, hasn't pitched in a regular-season game since the  
first of his four major elbow operations in 1995. He's throwing 
every other day without pain and wants to give his comeback one 
more try. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm throwing (long distances) and I'm throwing short-toss real  
hard,'' Rijo said, in a telephone interview from the Dominican 
Republic. ``So I'm getting real close to getting to the mound; I'm 
thinking basically I'm ready right now. I've put so much time and 
money into the complex that I want to make sure everything is ready 
before I leave here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds are willing to give their 1990 World Series MVP another  
chance to see if he can beat incredibly long odds and pitch again. 
</P>
<P>
	``For what he does for the organization on and off the field,  
we're going to be as accommodating as we can,'' assistant general 
manager Doc Rodgers said Monday from the team's training complex in 
Sarasota, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Rijo has spent most of the offseason supervising his baseball  
academy, which will develop young Dominican players. He said a 
hotel for players is finished and workers are putting the final 
touches on two fields. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to make sure they're doing it right,'' Rijo said.  
``It's going to be amazing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He estimated that the complex should be finished in two to three  
weeks. At that time, he'll join the Reds in Sarasota to talk about 
a minor-league deal -- the same thing he has last season -- and 
discuss a working agreement for the academy. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea is for Rijo's academy to develop players for the Reds.  
Rijo and the club have begun looking into how working agreements 
are structured between other teams and baseball academies in Latin 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're both putting together the paperwork,'' Rodgers said.  
``One of the other reasons we anticipate him getting here is so we 
can work on that face-to-face. It's probably all going to come 
together at the same time -- evaluate him as a player and nail down 
negotiations on the academy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds will see how much progress Rijo has made in his  
throwing and go from there. 
</P>
<P>
	``We probably would have him come in and throw for us and see  
what his status is and go from there,'' Rodgers said. ``He's worked 
as hard as anybody probably ever to get back on the mound and play 
competitively.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rijo experienced soreness in his elbow last spring, forcing him  
to back off of his rehabilitation program. He had the elbow 
ligament reattached in August 1997 -- the most recent of his four 
major operations.

<HEADLINE> New Initiation for VMI Freshmen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW MARKET, Va. (AP) -- The six-month initiation period for this  
year's freshman ``rats'' at Virginia Military Institute wrapped up 
with an arduous march to a battlefield where a previous cadet corps 
fought Union troops in the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's ``breakout,'' the annual conclusion to six months of  
rigorous physical and mental conditioning known as the ``rat 
line,'' was a departure from the practice since 1982 in which the 
freshmen climbed a muddy hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the students marched for 18 1/2 miles in cold drizzle  
Sunday from Harrisonburg to New Market. They then cheered and 
charged through plumes of purple, green and red smoke in a 
commemoration of the 1864 Battle of New Market, in which 12 cadets 
were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The change was initiated by this year's VMI seniors.  
</P>
<P>
	``The seniors wanted to reconnect with the New Market  
battlefield,'' VMI Superintendent Josiah Bunting said. ``That 
history is something we're very proud of, and this commemorates the 
historic youthful valor of the school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bunting, 59, joined in the march with the students, going the  
entire 18 1/2 miles. None of the 382 freshmen dropped out, either. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the rats were hurting, but that's to be expected,''  
said Matthew Staton, a senior who marched with the underclassmen to 
provide medical attention.. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so happy it's over. It hurts so good,'' said Lisa Kasper,  
one of the 26 women in VMI's second coed class. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials say the ``rat line'' process is supposed to  
break the rats down and rebuild them as model citizen-soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Gov. Moonbeam's Star Rises Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Hosting a fund-raiser for a local  
observatory, Jerry Brown squinted up at the model planets suspended 
from a velvety black ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want you to notice that you are... in a moonbeam  
environment,'' he said, getting chuckles from the well-dressed 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown can afford to laugh at his old nickname, ``Gov.  
Moonbeam,'' given after some of his flakier pronouncements as 
California's chief executive in the 1970s and '80s. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first seven weeks as mayor of this struggling city, he's  
welcomed two new businesses, made a high-profile appearance at the 
sentencing of a notorious crack dealer and backed a power play 
aimed at shaking up the school system. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Moonbeam has been somewhat eclipsed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Politicians from everywhere should come out and study him  
because he's giving a master class on politics,'' says James 
Lorenz, who worked for Brown in his first term as governor. ``He's 
at the top of his game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last June, Brown won a landslide victory on a four-point  
platform: fight crime; get 10,000 people to move downtown; 
galvanize the school system; and celebrate the arts. As 
mayor-elect, he followed up with a strong-mayor ballot measure 
giving him the power he said he needed. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, he's stayed on point, defying critics who dismiss him as  
brilliant but erratic. 
</P>
<P>
	Milestones so far include the announcements that San  
Francisco-based Providian Financial Corp. will open a 1,000-job 
center here and that California Bank &AMP; Trust will move its 
headquarters from San Francisco, for an additional 330 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Two national newspapers are planning travel pieces on Oakland,  
and the Travel Channel recently taped a two-hour walking tour with 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	All of which create quite a morale boost for Oakland, a city of  
400,000 -- 40 percent black, 30 percent white and about 15 percent 
each Asian and Hispanic -- that has long played awkward sister to 
glamorous San Francisco across the bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a makeover,'' says Lorenz. ``Here's this patrician  
and he comes here and he is agreeing to put this city on the map in 
a nice way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the education front, Brown supports legislation to put the  
district under control of a Brown-appointed trustee. He says he's 
not eager to take over the schools, plagued for years by dismal 
test scores, ``but I'm definitely going to ramp up the pressure on 
the school board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's hit a few snags while shaking up the status quo -- ``The  
embedded quality of the resistance is sobering,'' Brown says -- but 
backed by City Manager Robert Bobb, changes are afoot. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor and city manager haven't always been in sync. Bobb  
opposed Brown's strong-mayor ballot initiative, although he decided 
to stay on anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to prove myself wrong,'' says Bobb, who describes the  
first seven weeks as ``a roller coaster ride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The son of former Gov. Pat Brown, Jerry Brown served as governor  
himself in 1975-1983 and ran three times for president, folding in 
stints as a Buddhist scholar and aide to Mother Teresa along the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
	He moved to Oakland five years ago, setting up a commune of  
sorts in a waterfront building. Since then, he has become a 
tireless civic cheerleader, albeit one with a warts-and-all 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``The suburbs are cleaner, cheaper, safer and they have better  
schools,'' he recently confessed to a convention of experts in 
geographic information systems. ``I say Oakland can beat all of 
that.'' He paused. ``Don't ask me how yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone in town is in the Brown cheering section.  
</P>
<P>
	When Brown and Bobb led a contingent of fed-up Oaklanders to the  
sentencing of a drug dealer, the dealer's wife angrily accused 
Brown of making political use of her husband's downfall. 
</P>
<P>
	And at a hearing over military exercises planned in Oakland and  
Alameda, Brown took heat from both anti-military activists and a 
councilwoman upset that Brown had publicly welcomed the military 
before the City Council had addressed the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	It's too early to say whether energy and drive, no matter how  
high-octane, can turn around a city with Oakland's problems. In 
1998, for instance, Oakland had 81 murders compared to 63 in San 
Francisco, which has twice the population. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lorenz says Brown already has settled one civic sore point,  
the famous declaration from former resident Gertrude Stein that 
``there is no there there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first time anyone has had a rejoinder,'' Lorenz  
says. ``Jerry is saying, 'Oh yes, there is a here here.'''

<HEADLINE> Few First Lady's Have Sought Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Run, Florence, run. And what about Edith,  
Eleanor or Jackie? 
</P>
<P>
	Hillary Rodham Clinton isn't the only presidential wife ever  
urged to run for political office. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1920s there were calls to draft President Warren  
Harding's widow, Florence, for governor of Ohio and President 
Woodrow Wilson's widow, Edith, for vice president. Some Democrats 
wanted Eleanor Roosevelt to be the party's vice presidential 
nominee in 1948. In 1976, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, then a book 
editor in New York, briefly flirted with running for a Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
	These four first ladies -- all mentioned as candidates after they  
left the White House -- declined the overtures. If Mrs. Clinton 
actually seeks the Senate seat being vacated by Democrat Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan of New York, she'd be the only first lady to ever 
run for elective office. She's spending two days in New York City 
on Wednesday and Thursday, perhaps to test the senatorial waters. 
</P>
<P>
	``The difference with Hillary is that she is recognized and  
respected as a political figure in her own right,'' says Carl 
Sferrazza Anthony, a historian of first ladies. ``Even though the 
other four were politically minded, I think they were being drafted 
as a bridge to their husbands' memory, a symbol of their husbands' 
legacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The political lineage of presidents runs deeper with sons.  
</P>
<P>
	Sons of several presidents went on to be congressmen, senators --  
even presidents themselves. On the state level, President Bush's 
son, Jeb, currently is governor of Florida. Another son, George W. 
Bush, is governor of Texas and is considering a bid for the GOP 
presidential nomination in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Mrs. Clinton has said little about the ``Draft Hillary''  
campaign. She says only that she's giving it ``careful thought,'' 
yet she's getting plenty of political advice. 
</P>
<P>
	Former New York Mayor Ed Koch says ``Run.'' Former New York  
congresswoman Geraldine Ferraro advises Mrs. Clinton to wait, run 
later for a Senate seat from Illinois and then be the Democrats' 
presidential candidate in 2008. Former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo 
wants to see her run, but also suggests she could duck elective 
office and still be a political force. ``Be Eleanor Roosevelt,'' he 
advised. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Roosevelt is one of Mrs. Clinton's personal heroes. She has  
told of conducting imaginary talks with Mrs. Roosevelt about 
contemporary problems and the role of the first lady in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	The two were born in different centuries, yet have much in  
common, says Myra Gutin, a historian of first ladies at Rider 
University in New Jersey. ``Both are politically minded. Both are 
widely respected, but also greatly criticized,'' Ms. Gutin says. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, the only first lady to chair a presidential  
commission, was criticized for the secrecy in which her Task Force 
on Health Reform operated. Mrs. Roosevelt was the only first lady 
to hold a government position in her husband's administration. She 
resigned as assistant director of civilian defense after coming 
under fire. 
</P>
<P>
	After she left the White House, Mrs. Roosevelt, revered for her  
work on social issues, was appointed U.S. delegate to the newly 
formed United Nations. Then in 1948, she squelched an attempt to 
draft her as Harry Truman's running mate in 1948, preferring to 
stay at the United Nations and continue her role as a Democratic 
Party elder. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the nation's earliest days -- more than a century before  
women were even allowed to vote -- the country has had first ladies 
who were perhaps as politically astute as their husbands. Mrs. 
Harding spoke out on issues affecting women and veterans. Mrs. 
Wilson was called the ``secret president'' because she handled many 
presidential duties after her husband's disabling stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	Abigail Adams thought of herself less as a first lady and more  
of a ``co-president'' -- something that husband John Adams did not 
discourage, says historian Anthony. The country's second president 
called his wife ``my best, dearest, worthiest, wisest friend in 
this world'' and told her: ``I think you shine as a stateswoman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise the most recent first ladies. But most of them have  
distanced themselves from politics after leaving the White House, 
opting instead to promote their favorite causes. 
</P>
<P>
	Claudia ``Lady Bird'' Johnson founded the National Wildflower  
Research Center and Betty Ford set up the Betty Ford Center for 
alcohol and drug dependents. Rosalyn Carter works to promote peace 
and human rights worldwide. Nancy Reagan promoted the ``just say no 
to drugs'' campaign. Barbara Bush organized a literacy foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 

</P>
<P>
	A number of presidential sons -- and Ronald Reagan's daughter --  
were bitten by the political bug: 
</P>
<P>
	--John Quincy Adams, son of President John Adams, served in the  
Senate and later became the sixth U.S. president. After leaving the 
White House, he served 17 years in the House. He suffered a stroke 
and died in the Capitol in 1848. His son, Charles Francis Adams, 
was also a congressman. 
</P>
<P>
	--William Harrison's son, John, became a congressman; his  
grandson, Benjamin, was the 23rd president; and his great-grandson, 
Russell, served in the Indiana legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	--William Taft's son, Robert, was a senator who competed  
unsuccessfully for the Republican presidential nomination against 
Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	--John Tyler, Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Martin Van Buren had  
sons who served in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	--Theodore Roosevelt's son, Teddy Jr., was governor of Puerto  
Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	--Another of Franklin Roosevelt's sons, Elliott, was mayor of  
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	--George Bush's son, Jeb, is governor of Florida. Another son,  
George W. Bush Jr., is governor of Texas and is considering a bid 
for the GOP presidential nomination in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	--President Kennedy's son, John Jr., has never sought political  
office, yet his name has been mentioned as a possible candidate for 
the Senate from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	--The only presidential daughter to run for office was Maureen  
Reagan, who failed to win the Republican primary in a 1982 Senate 
race in California.

<HEADLINE> Tom Seaver Returns to Mets Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. (AP) -- It didn't take long for Tom Seaver  
to give advice to the New York Mets pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Seaver, the Hall of Fame right-hander considered to be the  
greatest player in Mets history, reported to the team's spring 
training camp Monday to begin a 12-day stint as a special 
instructor. Seaver will work with Mets pitching coach Bob Apodaca 
in helping young pitchers with their mechanics after signing on 
last month as a television announcer and front office executive 
with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Seaver's first pupil Monday was 27-year-old Jason Isringhausen,  
who did not play at all last season because of arm injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just talked to him about setting up every time,'' Seaver  
said. ``Pitching is about controlling all those small things, 
especially when you are trying to maintain consistency. At the end 
of throwing in the bullpen, he was not going to his start position, 
he was going right to his windup. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a line you cross between working on throwing and  
working on pitching. When you are working on pitching, you have to 
go to the setup position. You try to be repetitive and create very 
positive habits, even to the most minuscule thing. It's the 
discipline factor, and I'm a stickler for the discipline of 
mechanics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Isringhausen said he was glad to receive Seaver's advice.  
</P>
<P>
	``You just look at him and are kind of overwhelmed,'' said  
Isringhausen, who has encountered a variety of elbow and shoulder 
problems in his career. ``I will listen to anything he says to me. 
It is a total respect thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was amazing, without all the modern-day surgeries, that he  
was able to go out there and pitch as long as he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seaver, who is now 54, won 311 games and three Cy Young Awards  
and was an eight-time All-Star in a 20-year career with the Mets, 
Reds, White Sox and Red Sox. The number 41, which he wore Monday, 
is the only retired Mets number. 
</P>
<P>
	Apodaca says having Seaver in camp will be a great benefit for  
the team's pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will be a great working relationship. I don't see  
any pitfalls,'' Apodaca said. ``His passion is pitching and my life 
is baseball, and if we can get another pair of experienced eyes, 
it's got to help. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be stupid if I let my ego get in the way. Heck, he was  
doing X's and O's back when I was playing tic-tac-toe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seaver said he is anxious to help out wherever he can, and  
Japanese pitcher Hideo Nomo is one player he intends to work with. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing about Nomo that is on my checklist is to see  
what he is like at his release point,'' Seaver said. ``All the 
other stuff can be superfluous, but the more the movement, the more 
the release point becomes inconsistent and fatigue can set in. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just like watching Arnold Palmer swing a golf club. You  
say a guy can't swing that way, but when he gets to the contact 
point, he's in the right spot. It might be the same way with 
Nomo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seaver said he was also impressed with new Mets relief pitcher  
Armando Benitez. 
</P>
<P>
	``Benitez, wow,'' Seaver said. ``He threw a slider, I was  
standing behind him, and my knees still buckled.''

<HEADLINE> Body of Missing Mass. Boy Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORTON, Mass. (AP) -- One need only look at the snow covering  
this rural town to see how hard everyone searched for little Corey 
Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	Within a mile of his gray, clapboard home, there wasn't a  
snowbank, not a yard, not a ditch untrampled by the feet of 
hundreds of rescuers. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, a furious four-day search for the 9-year-old who  
wandered into a storm looking for his dog, Jasmine, came to an end 
when a searcher spotted Corey's lifeless body curled up on the 
banks of a partially frozen brook only 300 yards from his home. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was lying on his left side.... He was trying to get dry,''  
said Massachusetts State Police Trooper Paul Hartley, his voice 
cracking as he described the end of the agonizing search. 
</P>
<P>
	Divers had passed the spot several times but missed Corey.  
Perhaps, they said, he was covered by snow that has since begun 
melting under the New England rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Martha Mitchell, a mother of two whose property borders the  
brook nearby, watched as firefighters rowed their canoe to the bank 
after the search was called off. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh shoot!'' she said, breaking into tears. ``He was so  
close.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell said she and her children, ages 12 and 13, had combed  
nearby woods looking for Corey. ``We'd walk 10 or 12 steps, call 
out his name and then listen in the silence for him to call back,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they found the fourth-grader curled in a ball in  
dense underbrush. The stripes from his Boston Bruins jacket caught 
a searcher's eye. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked why the boy would be in such a spot -- with growth so  
thick an adult would have to crawl on hands and knees to enter -- 
Hartley said simply, in a low voice: ``He got lost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hartley said it appeared Corey was trying to stay out of the  
waters of the swamp next to the creek when he died. 
</P>
<P>
	The case captured national attention as hundreds of searchers  
combed the boy's neighborhood around the clock for more than three 
days in bad weather, hoping against the dwindling odds of finding 
him alive. 
</P>
<P>
	The searchers used everything available -- from dogs, horses, and  
canoes to a helicopter with a heat-seeking infrared device -- to 
search cranberry bogs, swamps and a partially frozen lake behind 
the boy's home. 
</P>
<P>
	They had gone over the Mulberry Brook area five times.  
</P>
<P>
	Police said they do not believe Corey drowned, but an autopsy  
was scheduled. His family remained at home and had no comment 
Sunday. But through police, they thanked those who searched for 
their son. 
</P>
<P>
	Corey was bundled up in two jackets, a sweater and his mother's  
black fur-lined boots when he left his house around noon Thursday 
in search of his golden retriever mix. The dog turned up an hour 
later in a neighbor's yard. 
</P>
<P>
	A powerful nor'easter had canceled school that day and was  
dumping the first of 7 inches of snow in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	State police said Corey, described as a witty, creative child  
who preferred video games to the outdoors, suffered from attention 
deficit disorder and had missed some doses of medication. 
</P>
<P>
	Corey's parents made tearful appearances on the evening news  
when the boy vanished. By Saturday morning, the couple was secluded 
in their home. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our hearts go out to them... given the sad, sad situation,''  
said State Police Lt. Paul Maloney.

<HEADLINE> ABC Expecting Big Lewinsky Audience </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Anticipating a big audience for Barbara Walters'  
interview with Monica Lewinsky on Wednesday night, ABC is asking 
advertisers for five times what they normally would pay for a 
30-second commercial on ``20/20.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC also has begun running ``teaser'' ads, showing Walters  
throwing questions at Lewinsky but revealing none of her answers. 
</P>
<P>
	The network generally charges $160,000 for half-minute ads on  
regular editions of ``20/20.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two-hour Lewinsky interview, scheduled for 9 p.m. EST on  
Wednesday, is being categorized as a special, so ABC has hiked the 
price to about $800,000, said executives familiar with ad sales. 
Advertisers who had bought time months ago on ``20/20'' will either 
have to pay the new price or drop out. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, Fox charged advertisers a record $1.6 million to  
buy 30-second ads on the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the nation's biggest advertisers have said they weren't  
interested in hawking their products as the former White House 
intern talks about her affair with President Clinton. Procter &AMP; 
Gamble, whose products include Ivory soap, Tide detergent and Crest 
toothpaste, normally avoids news programs because of potentially 
controversial topics, spokeswoman Gretchen Briscoe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola also is steering clear of Lewinsky. ``It just doesn't  
seem like something that would be right for our brands,'' 
spokeswoman Kari Bjorhus said. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's ad sales department is targeting movie studios and  
Internet companies, believing they're more willing to take a gamble 
on the material attracting a big audience, said Bob Flood of DeWitt 
Media, an advertising buying firm. 
</P>
<P>
	One analyst predicted a huge night in the ratings for ABC,  
estimating that 45 percent of the nation's televisions in use that 
night will be watching Lewinsky. ``ER,'' the year's top-ranked 
entertainment show, has an average audience share of 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are sick of it, without a doubt, but no one has had a  
chance to sit down and hear what she's had to say,'' said Marc 
Berman of the advertising firm Seltel. ``This is an event. People 
are going to watch it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Paul Schulman, who has his own advertising buying firm,  
predicts an audience share of between 25 and 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think now that it's over, I'm not sure that everyone even  
cares to hear from Monica,'' Schulman said. 
</P>
<P>
	When Oprah Winfrey interviewed Michael Jackson in 1993, the show  
drew a staggering 56 audience share, Nielsen Media Research said. 
Two years later, when Jackson was interviewed by Diane Sawyer, it 
had a 42 audience share. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ratings last week for its ``Dateline NBC'' interview with  
Juanita Broaddrick, who accused Bill Clinton of sexually assaulting 
her more than 20 years ago, were only slightly higher than a 
typical episode of the newsmagazine. It drew 15 percent of the 
available audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Because ABC only owns the domestic distribution rights to the  
interview, it won't be telecast on the Web, nor will the network 
make a full transcript available there. Instead, ABCnews.com will 
show some film clips online and show portions of the transcript, 
spokeswoman Michelle Bergman said.

<HEADLINE> Hard-Liners Lose in Iran Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Hard-line opponents of moderate President  
Mohammad Khatami failed to win a single seat in Iran's capital, the 
key district in the nation's first local elections, according to 
preliminary results published today. 
</P>
<P>
	Khatami loyalists won 12 of the 15 seats contested in Tehran in  
Friday's vote. The other three went to independents, results 
showed. 
</P>
<P>
	The city -- the intellectual, commercial and political center of  
the country -- is seen as a focus in the fierce struggle between 
hard-liners and moderates with in the Islamic government. 
</P>
<P>
	Women were front-runners in at least 20 cities, the results  
showed. Nearly all of them are supporters of Khatami, who has 
encouraged women to play a bigger role in Iran's political life. 
</P>
<P>
	Election officials had counted nearly 10 million votes, or 40  
percent of the ballots, by Sunday night, Tehran radio reported, 
quoting the Interior Ministry which is supervising the poll. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministry says final results may not come before Friday,  
especially in larger cities like Tehran. In some towns and cities, 
the turnout was so high that polling stations ran out of ballots 
and voting hours had to be extended twice. 
</P>
<P>
	About 330,000 candidates ran for some 200,000 seats on municipal  
councils in the election, the first such vote since the 1979 
revolution. Some seats were unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Khatami supporters were ahead in 11 of Iran's 28 provinces, the  
moderate newspaper, Akhbar, reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tehran, former Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri, a well-known  
Khatami loyalist, received the largest number of votes, according 
to the results published in Iranian newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hard-liners in Parliament forced Nouri from the Interior  
Ministry last year over his support for Khatami's policy of greater 
social, political and cultural freedom. They unsuccessfully tried 
to disqualify Nouri from running in the local elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Early results showed pro-Khatami women were doing well in cities  
such as Orumiyeh, Kermanshah, Sari and Masjed Soleyman. In Saveh, a 
city about 60 miles southeast of Tehran, four women were among the 
front-runners for seven seats. 
</P>
<P>
	Women have looked to Khatami, a moderate cleric, to improve  
their social standing. They were instrumental in Khatami's victory 
against a hard-line rival in the May 1997 presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
	Since taking office, Khatami has appointed a woman as a  
vice-president and chosen several other women as advisers. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the Majlis, or parliament, which was elected in 1996,  
only 14 women serve among 270 members.

<HEADLINE> Hurricanes Set for Tournament Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- It's tournament time in South Florida, and this  
March that means more than just tennis and golf. 
</P>
<P>
	March Madness has come to Miami, where coach Leonard Hamilton's  
Hurricanes are being touted as perhaps the best team in school 
history -- and certainly the best in several decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami broke into the top 10 Monday for the first time since  
1960. The ninth-ranked Hurricanes are the No. 2 seed behind Big 
East Conference champion Connecticut in the league tournament 
beginning Wednesday, and a successful showing at Madison Square 
Garden could earn Miami a No. 2 seed in the NCAA tournament next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	That's strong stuff for a program that never has won an NCAA  
tournament game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hats off to Miami,'' Rutgers coach Kevin Bannon said.  
``They're an easy team to root for because their kids conduct 
themselves with class ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami (21-5 overall, 15-3 Big East) has a first-round bye in the  
league tournament and will play the winner of Wednesday night's 
game between No. 7 seed Providence and No. 10 seed Georgetown. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hurricanes ended the regular season with eight consecutive  
wins, including Saturday's 68-63 victory over Rutgers. That game 
drew a crowd of 10,497, the fourth-largest in school history and an 
indication that the city is developing a taste for college 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a joy to see a crowd like that,'' All-Big East forward  
Tim James said. 
</P>
<P>
	No one appreciated the support more than Hamilton, whose teams  
traditionally play before thousands of empty seats at Miami Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``What people don't understand is this is not a two- or  
three-year process,'' Hamilton said. ``It's an eight-, nine-, 
10-year process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton came to Miami in 1990 and was 8-46 in the Big East  
after three seasons. Back then, the arrival of March was a relief 
because it meant the end of another bad season. 
</P>
<P>
	But this year, the Hurricanes head for New York expecting to  
make a big splash. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're almost at a peak, but we could get better,'' James said.  
``We're aiming to win the Big East tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hurricanes' reputation for smothering defense dates back  
several seasons, and lately they've shown improved firepower and 
impressive balance. James (18.9 points per game), all-Big East 
guard Johnny Hemsley (17.4) and center Mario Bland (11.2) provide 
an experienced three-pronged attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Rutgers coach Bannon described the Hurricanes as ``the cream of  
the crop in the league. They're playing great right now. They have 
great balance, their bench has gotten deeper and they play at both 
ends, which is what I like about them. They're very efficient 
offensively, and they're terrific at the defensive end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless of how the Hurricanes fare this week, they're assured  
of a spot in the NCAA tournament. That's a new situation for 
Hamilton's team, which barely made the field a year ago -- Miami's 
first berth in the tournament in 38 years -- then lost in the 
opening round to UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year at this time we were biting our nails,'' Hemsley  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes a lot of stress off us,'' James said. ``This year we  
can kick back and have a party.''

<HEADLINE> Purchasing Index Reverses Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The nation's manufacturing sector reawakened in  
February after an eight-month decline as production, orders for new 
business and export orders increased significantly, corporate 
purchasing executives said in a survey released today. The results 
provided the first hints that U.S. factories were winning back some 
of the business they lost to the Asian economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Purchasing Management reported its  
monthly index of business activity rose to 52.4 percent last month, 
an increase of 2.9 percentage points from its January level. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAPM assesses the health of the nation's factories, and in  
turn the overall economy, through a monthly survey of its members. 
The trade group's findings are widely followed by economists 
including Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan because 
they usually are the first indicator of how the economy performed 
in the just-ended month. 
</P>
<P>
	``The survey indicates the worst effects of the economic turmoil  
around the world are behind us,'' said Marilyn Schaja, money market 
economist at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Securities Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the most significant change in the manufacturing sector  
was a surge in export orders, which rose for the first time since 
November 1997. The NAPM's New Export Orders Index surged 4.2 
percentage points to 54.0 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Though it may be premature to say that manufacturing is back,  
particularly with the persistent softness in prices, this certainly 
signals a possible reversal of recent fortunes in the sector,'' 
said Norbert J. Ore, chairman of the NAPM's survey committee. 
</P>
<P>
	January's report had hinted at a turnaround -- although  
manufacturing declined for an eighth straight month, the rate of 
decline was slower. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchasing managers' February report means the overall  
economy continued to strengthen as well. Further evidence that the 
economy remains robust came in a separate report today from the 
Commerce Department, which said Americans' personal incomes rose a 
strong 0.6 percent in January, while spending rose a moderate 0.3 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturing has been one of the only laggards in the expanding  
U.S. economy as the financial turmoil in Asia and Latin America 
sapped demand for U.S. products. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAPM said that of the 20 industries in the manufacturing  
sector, nine reported improved business in February, with wood and 
related products and tobacco posting the strongest gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the overall strong numbers, there were still weak spots  
in the manufacturing sector. Manufacturing employment declined for 
a ninth consecutive month, the NAPM said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Employment tends to be a bit of a lagging indicator,'' Schaja  
said. ``Going forward, I think it will improve along with the 
industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	February marked the 94th consecutive month of overall U.S.  
economic growth, the NAPM said.

<HEADLINE> Tennis Great Bill Talbert Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bill Talbert, a star player who later became  
tournament director of the U.S. Open, is dead at age 80. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1967 enshrinee of the International Tennis Hall of Fame in  
Newport, R.I., Talbert died Sunday in his Manhattan home. Cause of 
death was not immediately known, but he had been confined to a 
wheelchair for the last several years. 
</P>
<P>
	William F. Talbert, born in Cincinnati on Sept. 4, 1918, was  
diagnosed at age 10 with diabetes. He was recognized as the first 
diabetic to compete in athletics at the highest international 
level. 
</P>
<P>
	He reached the singles finals at the U.S. Championships -- later  
known as the U.S. Open -- in 1944 and 1945 and the U.S. Indoor 
Championships in 1948-51. He was ranked among the top 10 in the 
United States from 1941 through 1955, and was a stalwart of the 
American Davis Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
	As a player, he starred in doubles, teaming with Gardnar Mulloy  
to reach the U.S. doubles final six times, winning in 1942, '45, 
'46 and '48. He also captured the U.S. Championship mixed doubles 
with Margaret Osborne four straight years -- 1943-46. 
</P>
<P>
	Talbert teamed with Tony Trabert, another Hall of Famer, to win  
both the French and Italian doubles titles in 1950, and was U.S. 
Davis Cup captain from 1953-57, defeating Australia to win the Cup 
in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
	Known as ``Mr. Tennis,'' Talbert was named director of the U.S.  
Open Championships at Forest Hills and served as chairman and 
director of the Open from 1971-75. When the Grand Slam tournament 
moved to Flushing Meadows, Talbert returned as director from 
1978-87 and served as honorary vice chairman until his death. 
</P>
<P>
	Having played in both the longest men's doubles match and mixed  
doubles match on record, Talbert was instrumental in introducing 
the tiebreaker in a major tournament in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	He was chairman emeritus of the Hall of Fame, served on the Hall  
of Fame's executive committee and was tournament chairman of the 
Hall of Fame Tennis Championships in Newport. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a member of the National Diabetes Advisory Board, the  
President's Advisory Council of the American Diabetes Association 
and a director of the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation. Last year, 
Talbert marked 50 years of service with the U.S. Banknote 
Corporation in New York, where he was a vice president from 1953 
until his death. 
</P>
<P>
	He also co-authored eight books, including the acclaimed ``The  
Game of Doubles in Tennis,'' and his autobiography, ``Playing for 
Life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Talbert was married to the former Nancy Pike, an editor for  
Vogue and Life Magazine, from 1946 until her death in 1995. He is 
survived by two sons, W. Pike and Peter, and two grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	At the request of the family, funeral services will be private.

<HEADLINE> Senators Ask Clinton to Aid Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Almost two dozen senators urged President  
Clinton to conduct a full examination into concentration within the 
agriculture industry, saying that America's farmers are 
experiencing desperate economic conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``While thousands of farmers are being forced out of agriculture  
due to collapsed commodity prices, many of our nation's food 
processors are posting exceptional returns and record profits,'' 
the senators wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The coalition, led by Sens. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., and Chuck  
Hagel, R-Neb., asked the administration to complete a ``full-scale, 
detailed examination'' within six months. The letter, dated Feb. 
26, was sent to the White House on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Agricultural commodity markets, particularly in livestock,  
have become tilted against the producer and are failing to provide 
effective competitive returns,'' the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	America's farm sectors already were reeling from last year's low  
prices when news came that this year won't be much better. The 
Agriculture Department predicted last week another year of low 
prices and lagging exports, lowering U.S. farm export projections 
to $49 billion compared to last year's $53.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is important that Congress have a clear picture regarding  
the impacts of the rapid increase in market concentration in 
agriculture and what steps may need to be taken,'' the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration established an interagency panel last  
year to look at concentration, and several agencies within the 
Agriculture Department are conducting their own studies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to address the changing structure of agriculture,''  
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman told a forum last week as he 
released the price and export projections. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem of concentration came to prominence in November when  
Cargill Inc. of Minneapolis, the nation's No. 1 grain company, 
announced plans to buy the worldwide operations of second-ranked 
Continental Grain Co. The Justice Department is reviewing the 
proposed merger. 
</P>
<P>
	In the time since, both the House and Senate have held hearings.  
Some lawmakers have pressed for a meeting with Attorney General 
Janet Reno. 
</P>
<P>
	According to USDA figures, as of 1997, the four largest packing  
firms accounted for 80 percent of cattle slaughter, 54 percent of 
hog slaughter and 70 percent of sheep slaughter.

<HEADLINE> Arkansas-Little Rock Coach Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Wimp Sanderson resigned Monday as  
basketball coach at Arkansas-Little Rock, saying it was time to 
give the program to ``some other guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanderson, who took Alabama to 10 NCAA tournament appearances in  
12 years, quit after 38 years in coaching. His team finished 12-15 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt this was the time for me to get out no matter what kind  
of year we had,'' Sanderson said at a campus news conference. 
``It's something I've been thinking about for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanderson lamented that he was unable to take Arkansas-Little  
Rock to the NCAA tournament -- the Trojans haven't been there since 
1990 although they did play in the National Invitation Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanderson's best record at Little Rock was 23-7 in 1995-96.  
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas-Little Rock lost to top-seeded Louisiana Tech 68-66 in  
Saturday's Sun Belt Conference quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanderson, 61, has been at Little Rock for five years. He was an  
assistant at Alabama for 20 years, before becoming head coach in 
1980. He led the Crimson Tide to SEC tournament championships from 
1989-91. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanderson was voted the SEC's Coach of the Decade for the 1980s.  
</P>
<P>
	He earned his 300th victory in 14 seasons, the 10th coach in  
NCAA history to reach 300 that fast. 
</P>
<P>
	After 12 years as Alabama's head coach, Sanderson was fired for  
allegedly striking his secretary.

<HEADLINE> Hartwig Sets U.S. Pole Vault Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Jeff Hartwig knows how it feels to be a nobody.  
He doesn't have to worry about that anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	Hartwig now can boast about how he bettered his own American  
indoor record in the pole vault, going over the bar at 19 feet, 5 
inches in the USA Championships on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Another record-breaker was Rohsaan Griffin, who set the American  
mark in the men's 200 meters in 20.32 seconds, breaking the record 
of 20.40 shared by 1997 world champion Kevin Little and Jeff 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, there were some upsets, including defeats for  
sprinter Maurice Greene, high jumper Charles Austin and shot putter 
John Godina. 
</P>
<P>
	Hartwig, who never vaulted more than 15 feet in high school or  
18 feet in college, finally broke the 19-foot barrier in 1996, 
barely making it at 19-0 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he's a marked man entering this weekend's world  
championships in Maebashi, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started to feel a little bit of that towards the end of the  
season last year,'' said the 31-year-old from Jonesboro, Ark., who 
raises boa constrictors and pythons for sale to pet stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the past, I've always sort of had to beg and plead to get  
into meets and all of a sudden the tables have turned a little 
bit,'' he said after erasing the mark of 19-4 3/4 he set last month at 
Reno. He then missed three times at 19-8 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I'd make it. If there's any disappointment at all,  
that's it,'' said Hartwig. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, Hartwig will be up against a tough field, including  
Maksim Tarasov, the Russian who has this season's indoor best of 
19-8 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely feel I have to step it up a notch. My jump is  
still only the second best in the world this year,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranked No. 2 in the world last year, when he established the  
American outdoor record of 19-8 1/4, Hartwig has cleared 19 feet in 22 
meets, surpassing the record of 20 held by Sergei Bubka, the world 
indoor and outdoor record-holder. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffin, the 1996 NCAA champion from LSU, edged Little at the  
finish. Little was runner-up at 20.41. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't realize I had run that fast,'' said Griffin. ``It was  
a surprise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other surprises were the showing of Greene, the world's  
top-ranked sprinter, who finished second in the 60. Austin, the 
1996 Olympic gold medalist, and Godina were third in their 
specialties. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene missed his world record by .01 second in winning his  
semifinal in 6.40 seconds. In the final, a bad start cost him. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Harden, last year's first-place finisher who later was  
disqualified after testing positive for ephedrine and was suspended 
for three months, beat Greene in 6.44. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene said he slightly injured his left hamstring during the  
semifinals but decided to run the final, perhaps cautiously. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I'd run on guts and see what happened,'' said  
Greene, who indicated he would be ready for the Japan 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Austin, the 1996 Olympic champion and 1997 world indoor  
champion, cleared only 7-3. Little-known Henry Patterson and 
Stephen Smith cleared 7-6 1/2, but Patterson won on fewer misses. 
</P>
<P>
	Godina, the world's No. 1 shot putter the past two years, won  
the silver medal in the 1996 Olympics and the past two world 
outdoor titles. He was unbeaten in 17 meets last year and was 
undefeated in 24 meets since July 1997. He was voted USA Track &AMP; 
Field's top male athlete of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	He managed a best of only 67-6 3/4, finishing behind Andy Bloom,  
with a career-best 68-3 3/4, and C.J. Hunter, who reached 67-7 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter's wife, Marion Jones, the world's leading sprinter, said  
her husband, who injured his right shoulder on his final attempt, 
would not go to Japan, putting Godina on the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Gail Devers, inactive from last May until this month  
because of an Achilles tendon injury, won her fourth consecutive 
race, taking the women's 60 in 7.04. Devers, the two-time world 
indoor champion and two-time Olympic gold medalist at 100 meters, 
got in from Stockholm at 4 p.m. on Friday and got little sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had exactly 1 hour and 12 minutes of sleep last night,'' she  
said. ``I couldn't sleep, so I just got up and got on my 
computer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Angelo Taylor, a junior at Georgia Tech, edged Milt Campbell to  
win the men's 400 in 45.50, fastest in the world this year. Taylor 
will not make the trip to the world championships, staying home to 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	Reggie Torian remained unbeaten this season, winning the  
60-meter hurdles in 7.38, the best in the world and a meet record. 
</P>
<P>
	Lance Deal won his 11th title in the 35-pound weight throw at  
77-11 1/2 to become the winningest male athlete in meet history. 
</P>
<P>
	Meet records fell in three women's events: Dawn Ellerbe won her  
fourth straight 20-pound weight throw with a heave of 74-8 1/4; 
Melissa Morrison won the 60 hurdles in 7.85; and Stacy Dragila won 
her fourth straight pole vault title at 14-7 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Adam Goucher captured the 3,000 in 7:46.06, the fastest by an  
American this year, and Tisha Waller won her third indoor high jump 
title at 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Jearl Miles-Clark, the 1997 world indoor champion in the women's  
400, won her third straight national title and fourth overall, in 
51.97.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Lower; Dow Down 16 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened lower this morning, as strong  
economic data extended last week's bond market decline and pushed 
interest rates higher. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 16.57 at 9,290.01, after dropping 59.76 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were lower as well. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was down 3.10 at 1,235.23, and the 
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was down 8.75 at 2,279.28. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 6-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 80.29 million shares, 
down from Friday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices fell, pulling stocks with them, after the Commerce  
Department reported that Americans' personal incomes increased a 
robust 0.6 percent in January, suggesting that Americans entered 
1999 with enough spending power to keep the economic expansion 
going. Spending rose moderately, up 0.3 percent. and their spending 
rose moderately, reflecting a strong start for the economy in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the National Association of Purchasing Management  
reported its index of purchasing activity rose to 52.4 percent in 
February from 49.5 percent in January. Any reading over 50 means 
the economy is expanding. 
</P>
<P>
	Both reports kept alive last week's worry that the economy is  
growing fast enough to spark inflation, and could prompt the 
Federal Reserve to tighten short-term interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's a big surprise that these numbers were  
strong, but 52.4 in the NAPM report was probably toward the upper 
end of expectations,'' said William Meehan, market strategist at 
Canter Fitzgerald. ``And just the directional movement in the bond 
market is enough to make people somewhat squeamish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.01 percent, amid  
mounting concerns about Japanese corporate profits. In afternoon 
trading, Germany's DAX index was down1.15 percent, Britain's FT-SE 
100 was down 0.92 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 0.63 
percent.

<HEADLINE> First Family Members Who Have Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A number of presidential sons -- and Ronald Reagan's daughter --  
were bitten by the political bug: 
</P>
<P>
	--John Quincy Adams, son of President John Adams, served in the  
Senate and later became the sixth U.S. president. After leaving the 
White House, he served 17 years in the House. He suffered a stroke 
and died in the Capitol in 1848. His son, Charles Francis Adams, 
was also a congressman. 
</P>
<P>
	--William Harrison's son, John, became a congressman; his  
grandson, Benjamin, was the 23rd president; and his great-grandson, 
Russell, served in the Indiana legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	--William Howard Taft's son, Robert, was a senator who competed  
unsuccessfully for the Republican presidential nomination against 
Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952. His grandson, also named Robert, was 
a congressman in the 1960s and a senator in the 1970s. And his 
great-grandson, Bob, is the current governor of Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	--John Tyler, Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Martin Van Buren had  
sons who served in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	--Theodore Roosevelt's son, Teddy Jr., was governor of Puerto  
Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	--Another of Franklin Roosevelt's sons, Elliott, was mayor of  
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	--George Bush's son, Jeb, is governor of Florida. Another son,  
George W. Bush, is governor of Texas and is considering a bid for 
the GOP presidential nomination in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	--President Kennedy's son, John Jr., has never sought political  
office, yet his name has been mentioned as a possible candidate for 
the Senate from New York. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Mother Teresa's Sainthood Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VATICAN CITY (AP) -- After pleas from faithful around the world,  
Pope John Paul II has launched the process towards possibly 
declaring Mother Teresa a saint. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vatican confirmed Sunday that the pope, one of Mother  
Teresa's greatest admirers, had waived the mandatory five-year 
waiting period and given Calcutta's archbishop the go-ahead to 
start the process for the nun. 
</P>
<P>
	Mother Teresa, hailed during her decades in the slums of India  
as a ``living saint,'' died in 1997 at age 87 after a life spent 
caring for the poor and the outcast, inspiring followers worldwide 
to take up her example. 
</P>
<P>
	The pope had earlier said the waiting period would apply even to  
Mother Teresa. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``the demand was so great and insistent that the Holy Father  
thought to go ahead'' and waive the period, said a Vatican 
spokesman, the Rev. Ciro Benedettini. 
</P>
<P>
	In Calcutta, Archbishop Henry D'Souza told The Associated Press  
he had received the letter of dispensation Dec. 12 from the 
Vatican's Congregation for the Causes of the Saints. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Holy Father would not have given this dispensation had he  
not received such requests from all over the world,'' the 
archbishop said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gathering proof at the diocesan level about the ``heroic virtue  
and reputation of holiness'' of Mother Teresa is a first step 
toward beatification, which requires confirmation of a miracle. 
Sainthood, the next step, requires certification of another 
miracle. 
</P>
<P>
	Two cases of seemingly miraculous healing attributed to Mother  
Teresa's intercession with God have been sent to the Vatican for 
verification, D'Souza said. 
</P>
<P>
	In one case, in the United States, a Frenchwoman who broke  
several ribs in a car accident was said to be healed when she wore 
a Mother Teresa medal around her neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Another case under study is that of a Palestinian girl whose  
cancer was cured after Mother Teresa appeared to her in her dreams. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Souza expressed hope the nun would be declared a saint in  
2000, when the Vatican celebrates the start of the third millennium 
of Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes centuries pass before candidates reach sainthood. But  
other cases move quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, the pope, who is a staunch believer in promoting saints  
as models of virtue, beatified the founder of the conservative 
Catholic organization Opus Dei only 17 years after his death. 
</P>
<P>
	During her life, Mother Teresa's influence was felt by the pope,  
who said a special Mass for her after she died. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Mother Teresa who convinced him that a shelter for the  
homeless should be built on Vatican grounds. The shelter opened a 
few years ago.

<HEADLINE> Convicted Minister Ponders Fate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- With a possible seven-year prison  
sentence ahead of him, the Rev. Henry Lyons, convicted of 
racketeering and grand theft, pondered his uncertain future in a 
safe haven -- his church. 
</P>
<P>
	The president of the National Baptist Convention USA, who on  
Saturday was found guilty of swindling millions of dollars, spent 
Sunday preaching to his congregation at Bethel Metropolitan Church 
in St. Petersburg. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to services, which were closed to the media, Lyons said:  
``I've got to sit down with my deacons and with my wife and with my 
family and see what we're going to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``I'll be doing some praying.''  
</P>
<P>
	Lyons was expected back in Pinellas County today for court  
officials to begin a pre-sentence investigation. He faces three to 
seven years in prison under state sentencing guidelines. A date for 
sentencing has not been set. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the National Baptist Convention USA's board of  
directors could meet as soon as the middle of this week to decide 
whether he should be removed from his post. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons has not said whether he now plans to resign. Before his  
conviction, he planned to seek another term when his expires this 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	Free on bond until his sentencing, Lyons was allowed to go to  
funeral services Sunday in Gainesville for his 81-year-old 
grandmother, who died last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Lyons was fingerprinted, Pinellas Circuit Judge Susan  
Schaeffer sternly warned the minister, warning that failing to 
appear for his sentencing ``would be disastrous for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I will appear, your honor,'' he responded quietly.  
</P>
<P>
	His subdued voice was one indication of how far the minister's  
fall from grace was. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons once was best known as a rousing preacher. His pleas from  
pulpits across the country helped greatly reduce the $5.4 million 
debt the convention accrued before he was elected president in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside of the church, he wielded vast political clout as leader  
of a group that claimed to have the largest black church 
organization in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	But state and federal prosecutors investigating the trail of  
Lyons' money eventually accused him and convention public relations 
director Bernice Edwards of stealing more than $4 million from 
corporations wanting to sell cemetery products, life insurance 
policies and credit cards to convention members. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Edwards was acquitted of racketeering, the sole charge she  
faced. 
</P>
<P>
	But she and Lyons both still face trial in federal court -- he on  
54 counts of tax evasion, extortion, money laundering and fraud; 
she on 27 similar counts.

<HEADLINE> 5 Dead From Strep in Chicago Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELGIN, Ill. (AP) -- As many as five people have died and another  
eight have been sickened by strep bacteria in the Chicago area in 
recent months, state health officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Three different strains of the bacteria are to blame, leading  
health officials to play down the possibility that all the cases 
are linked. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims include an 18-month-old boy, a man in his 40s who  
died of necrotizing fasciitis -- sometimes called the ``flesh-eating 
bacteria'' -- and a 90-year-old man who died of toxic shock 
syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	While such geographic clusters are unusual, they do occur,  
although experts don't really understand why, said Carl Langkop, 
chief of communicable diseases for the Illinois Department of 
Public Health. In many cases, investigators never uncover the 
source of the infections. 
</P>
<P>
	Group A strep strains most often lead to strep throat, but  
virulent strains can be deadly if not treated with antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
	About 10,000 to 15,000 people in the United States develop the  
illness each year, and about 2,000 die, according to the federal 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

<HEADLINE> CDC Hosts Gulf War Illness Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The federal government began a three-day  
conference Sunday on ``Gulf War syndrome,'' where doctors, 
scientists and veterans' advocates hope to develop recommendations 
for future research. 
</P>
<P>
	In the eight years since the Persian Gulf War's end, thousands  
of soldiers have complained of chronic, unexplained maladies such 
as fatigue, joint pain and memory loss. 
</P>
<P>
	To date, researchers have been at a medical loss, unable to  
scientifically link the symptoms of those who served in the 1991 
war to any particular disease or biological agent. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has acknowledged the illnesses are real, but  
claims that a lack of solid diagnoses or evidence of clear causes 
have hampered the path toward remedies. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1997 congressional investigation said likely causes included  
exposure to pesticides, smoke from oil well fires and other toxins. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-day conference is being sponsored by the Centers for  
Disease Control and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	The main goal is to provide a forum for public input to develop  
a multi-year research plan. CDC spokeswoman Gail Hayes said 
researchers are trying to understand the relationship between 
chemical exposures during the war and illnesses from which the 
veterans say they suffer.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises vs. Euro, Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rode to its highest point so far  
against the euro Monday as U.S. economic data continued to show a 
strengthening economy. The dollar also edged higher against the 
yen, but trading in the euro took precedence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a reinforcement of the positive U.S.  
fundamentals. That's part of what's been driving the euro lower 
since its inception in January,'' said Robert Lynch, a currency 
strategist at Banque Paribas. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 119.76  
Japanese yen, up from 119.17 on Friday. Also in late trading, the 
euro was quoted at $1.0887, down from $1.1026, flat with its lowest 
point ever at 1.0884 earlier in the trading day. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors took their cues in buying the dollar Monday on a  
couple of strong economic reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported that personal incomes increased  
a hearty 0.6 percent in January as spending rose a moderate 0.3 
percent. The data were interpreted to mean that not only is the 
economy strong now, but it will continue to be so for months. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Purchasing Management said  
manufacturing activity surged in February, reversing an eight-month 
decline. The index of monthly activity in the NAPM report showed a 
rise of 52.4 percent last month, up 2.9 percentage points from 
January. Any reading over 50 means the economy is expanding. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynch said that components within the purchasing report also  
suggested future positive activity. For instance, new orders rose 
sharply, ``suggesting there would be strength in the NAPM in 
upcoming months,'' Lynch said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4621 Swiss francs, up from  
1.4469, and 1.5220 Canadian dollars, up from 1.5101. The British 
pound rose to $1.6095, up from $1.6026. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the countries participating in the euro no longer  
are traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Monday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.7966 German 
marks, up from 1.7737; 6.0241 French francs, up from 5.9488; and 
Italian lire, 1,779.36, up from 1,757.47.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan To Launch White House Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Pat Buchanan, the conservative  
commentator whose low-budget, high-voltage campaigns shocked the 
Republican establishment in 1992 and 1996, is making a third run 
for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	He was beginning today in New Hampshire, the first-in-the-nation  
primary state where he defeated eventual GOP nominee Bob Dole in 
1996 and put a scare into President Bush four years before that. 
His first campaign swing of the 2000 election will take him to 13 
cities in 11 days. 
</P>
<P>
	``The man loves the stump,'' said Greg Mueller, a Republican  
media strategist who worked for Buchanan in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Buchanan has been underestimated time and again, many GOP  
strategists believe he peaked in Manchester four years ago. A 
bustling field of like-minded candidates, a greater demand for 
money, a relatively late start and doubts about his electability 
work against Buchanan this time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love Pat and agree with much of what he stands for, but I  
can't construct a scenario where he has a chance to win,'' said 
conservative leader Paul Weyrich, head of the Free Congress 
Foundation in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, 60, took a leave of absence from CNN's ``Crossfire''  
to run. He told associates he is bored with the television business 
and believes the early GOP front-runners, Texas Gov. George W. Bush 
and Elizabeth Dole, are vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither has formally entered the race.  
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan's target audience is blue-collar conservatives who  
share his opposition to abortion, free trade and the Washington 
establishment. His tactic: Galvanize voters and feed a hungry press 
corps, borrowing from his days as President Nixon's speechwriter to 
stitch together sound bites that incite and entertain. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan rallies ``peasants with pitchforks,'' not simply  
voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Bad guys aren't just bad, they're ``Vandals and Visigoths.''  
</P>
<P>
	And while others engage in studious ideological debates, this  
politician wages ``cultural wars'' and ``religious wars,'' ever 
mounting and riding ``to the sound of the guns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike his previous races, when Buchanan was the early  
alternative to the GOP front-runner, he will compete for the 
support of social conservative against such names as former Vice 
President Dan Quayle, religious activist Gary Bauer, millionaire 
businessman Steve Forbes, New Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith and radio 
commentator Alan Keyes. 
</P>
<P>
	And while he weighed his options for 2000, Forbes, Bauer and  
Quayle attracted several members of 1996 Buchanan team. Mueller, 
his hyper-quotable communications director, is on Forbes' bulging 
payroll. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of his grassroots activists who were there last time  
aren't there this time,'' said Mueller, who nonetheless predicts 
that Buchanan's message will have more resonance this campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's, like, ho-hum,'' said the Rev. Lou Sheldon, a  
conservative leader in Anaheim, Calif. ``He's failed twice and will 
(fail) a third time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weyrich and GOP consultant Eddie Mahe said Buchanan will further  
dilute the conservative constituency. ``He is one more person 
drawing from the same pool of voters,'' leaving more breathing room 
for establishment candidates such as Bush and Dole, Mahe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Reed, former director of the Christian Coalition, said  
establishment candidates won't get a free ride and warned that 
``anybody who underestimates Pat's appeal is making a serious 
mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He could hurt fellow conservatives. Little-known Bauer will find  
it harder to get media attention. Quayle, who is said to be finding 
fund raising tough sledding, has yet another competitor for 
conservative money. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith was the first candidate to formally enter the race. Fellow  
Republican Lamar Alexander, who also ran in 1996, will declare his 
candidacy a week from today. Rep. John Kasich of Ohio and Sen. John 
McCain of Arizona will announce in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore and former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley  
are the only announced candidates for the Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan staggered the candidacy of George Bush in 1992, drawing  
more than 37 percent of the vote in New Hampshire. He won the 
primary four years later with 27 percent of the vote, threatening 
the candidacy of Bob Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Bush and Dole recovered to win the nominations, as Buchanan  
ran out of steam and money.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton To Appear at NY Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton's much-ballyhooed -- but  
still undecided -- consideration of a Senate candidacy has New York 
donors clamoring to get into her sold-out fund-raiser for the 
Democratic National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	With Mrs. Clinton scheduled to appear at Wednesday's  
$150-per-plate luncheon at The Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, for the 
first time in its fund-raising history, the DNC is taking names -- 
300 of them -- for a waiting list, said party spokeswoman Melissa 
Bonney Ratcliff. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, the queue of donors may well seem small beside the  
news media lining up to cover the first lady's two-day trip. ``A 
mob scene'' is how one White House press aide forecast it after 
fielding inquiries from everybody from the city's tabloids to 
German television to a Greek newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	``Never before'' has the DNC seen such a donor boom, Ratcliff  
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of absolutely unbelievable interest in this event,  
we've already expanded the room to fit 900 and still, we're turning 
people away,'' she said. ``They're calling and asking to be put on 
a waiting list. We never do waiting lists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prospective guest tally stood at just 500 when the luncheon  
was scheduled three months ago, before prominent Democrats and New 
Yorkers began a ``draft Mrs. Clinton'' drive to see her replace 
retiring Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan in the state's 2000 
Senate race. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Republicans announced their own drive to cash in on  
the buzz surrounding the first lady. The National Republican 
Senatorial Committee launched a nationwide telemarketing campaign 
using the sheer possibility of Mrs. Clinton's candidacy to stoke 
Republican donors. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, while in New York on Wednesday, plans a morning  
speech on arts education at Intermediate School 25 in Queens, the 
DNC luncheon and a private dinner at the home of Wall Street tycoon 
Roger Altman, who was deputy treasury secretary during President 
Clinton's first term. On Thursday, she is to speak at the United 
Nations on the upcoming International Women's Day before visiting 
another city school to spotlight a new HBO documentary on women in 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Mrs. Clinton's most likely  
Republican opponent in any 2000 Senate bid, was invited by the city 
school district to appear with Mrs. Clinton on Wednesday morning, 
but he will not be there. Instead, the mayor will be in Washington 
to testify to the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee 
on reinventing government, a spokeswoman said.

<HEADLINE> Computer Disruptions Seen in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans can expect some power brownouts and  
should worry about their medical records, but disruptions from the 
Year 2000 computer glitch probably are manageable, two senators 
investigating the problem say. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will probably not know until we go through it,'' Sen.  
Robert Bennett, R-Utah, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is what will happen on Jan. 1, 2000, when older  
computer systems misread the year 2000 as 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will probably not have meltdown. This will not be the end  
of the world as we know it, the way some Web sites are 
predicting,'' Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate today held a hearing on legislation that would limit  
punitive damage and take other steps to ward off what some could be 
up to $1 trillion in lawsuits resulting from Y2K-related 
disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration voiced concern about limiting the legal  
rights of consumers to sue for damages, but Sen. Orrin Hatch, 
R-Utah, sponsor of the bill with Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., 
said it was needed to avoid ``a rash of litigation that will 
inevitably shift scarce resources from fixing the Y2K problem to 
defending lawsuits, many of which will be frivolous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett and Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., who appeared  
together on CBS' ``Face the Nation,'' plan to issue a report on 
possible ramifications from the Y2K computer problem. 
</P>
<P>
	A draft version of the report concludes that aviation airways  
will be safe, nuclear weapons will stay in their silos and most 
power grids will work. 
</P>
<P>
	But the lawmakers also pointed to major problems in foreign  
countries, notably Russia. In the United States, they said, there 
could be minor disruptions in food and energy supplies, health care 
and financial services. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you ought to do is prepare for a good storm, a hurricane,  
a storm where you'd like two or three days of ... water and canned 
goods and the like,'' Dodd said. People should not withdraw money 
from banks, he said, but they might want to save their financial 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
	One area of concern, Dodd said, is that some 90 percent of the  
nation's 800,000 doctors' offices are not prepared for the 
millennium bug, possibly resulting in temporary loss of medical 
records. 
</P>
<P>
	Richer hospitals will be prepared, but ``we are very, very  
worried'' about what could happen in urban or rural hospitals not 
moving quickly enough to fix equipment such as dialysis or heart 
monitoring machines, Dodd said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett said most U.S. power grids will be fine, and ``at worst  
we're going to have some brownouts'' in rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Yardeni, chief economist for Deutsche Bank Securities,  
who also appeared on CBS, said he was in a minority of economists 
who believe the computer problem could cause a global recession 
with the breakdown of inventory control systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett noted that one effect would be ``a flight to quality,''  
in which people take money out of countries where they fear an 
``infrastructure meltdown.'' One impact may be that the rich get 
richer and the poor get poorer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Utah senator said an accidental nuclear launch was ``very,  
very unlikely.'' More probable, he said, was that ``if somebody 
were to press the button to cause an intercontinental missile to go 
off, it wouldn't work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate report details possible problems with Russia's early  
warning system for incoming missiles. Bennett and Dodd are backing 
a plan to have experts from Russia, the United States, and possibly 
India and Pakistan, gather on Jan. 1 to ensure that no country is 
in the dark about the nuclear intentions of other countries in the 
event of a computer failure. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett said a Senate team sent to Russia concluded that ``yes,  
they are going to have real problems and no one is going to notice, 
because they said nothing works over there right now.''

<HEADLINE> Move To Unionize Doctors Gets Push </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Doctors, frustrated by stepped-up HMO control  
over their practices, are increasingly organizing into labor 
unions, a tactic that only a few years ago seemed remote for 
well-heeled healers. 
</P>
<P>
	The movement got another boost Monday as groups representing  
15,000 doctors joined together under a new National Doctors 
Alliance, part of the Service Employees International Union, which 
vowed to spend $1 million over the next year recruiting more 
physicians and dentists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today marks the beginning of a major initiative to organize  
doctors nationwide,'' said Dr. Barry Liebowitz, president of the 
New York-based, 2,500-member Doctors Council, which joined with the 
Committee of Interns and Residents and the United Salaried 
Physicians and Dentists to form the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, an estimated 38,000 to 45,000 doctors belong to  
unions, up from only about 25,000 two years ago, and experts 
predict the numbers will continue to grow. Those numbers are 
roughly 6 percent of the nation's 600,000 practicing doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	Liebowitz and others declined to say where they would target  
organizing efforts first. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Labor Relations Board has watched the number of  
doctors interested in unions grow, said spokesman Dave Parker. 
</P>
<P>
	``They find themselves not independent anymore, but working for  
hospitals or health maintenance organizations without the rights 
that they're used to,'' Parker said. ``They're working more like 
the rest of us, as employees who have bosses, and it's an 
interesting phenomenon to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many unionized doctors are interns and residents. All work  
full-time for hospitals or health maintenance organizations. Their 
contracts cover wages and working conditions, much like other 
workers' contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	About half of the nation's doctors now work in these type of  
salaried positions, with 80 percent of recent graduates taking such 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	But some independent doctors are also pushing for union  
representation. The NLRB's Philadelphia office is considering 
whether a group of New Jersey doctors who contract with HMOs can 
join together to collectively negotiate contracts. HMOs maintain 
these doctors are independent contractors and therefore fall 
outside federal labor law. 
</P>
<P>
	In discussing their plans, Liebowitz and other organizers  
focused on physician frustration with cost-conscious insurance 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Union membership provides doctors with a countervailing force  
against the denial of medical care for the sake of corporate 
profits,'' Liebowitz said, sounding the same complaints that have 
circulated through Capitol Hill and the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	HMOs have successfully controlled skyrocketing health costs by  
preventing unneeded treatments and closely watching the fees that 
doctors and hospitals charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers were less forceful about other physician complaints:  
that HMOs drive down their fees, using the power of their massive 
customer base to force doctors to accept lower payments as well as 
stricter rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Medical Association, a trade group that represents  
about half of the nation's doctors, shares the doctors' complaints 
but has long rejected traditional labor unions. But it said Monday 
it was looking for ways to help doctors ``collectively address 
these concerns'' without giving details. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the AMA's chief objections to labor unions was the threat  
of a strike, which many doctors say would be irresponsible since it 
could jeopardize patient care. 
</P>
<P>
	Liebowitz said he would never support a strike over economic  
issues such as higher pay, but would walk out to protest conditions 
that also threaten patient safety. He noted there have been few 
doctor strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Service Employees are not the only union going after  
doctors. The American Federation of State, County and Municipal 
Employees includes the 5,000-member Union of American Physicians 
and Dentists, based in Oakland, Calif. The International 
Association of Machinists and the United Food and Commerical 
Workers union have also worked to recruit members.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Olympics Denies Wrongdoings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Atlanta Olympics organizers admit to exceeding  
spending limits on gifts for IOC officials but told investigators 
they did nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter sent Friday to International Olympic Committee  
president Juan Antonio Samaranch, former Atlanta Olympics chief 
Billy Payne acknowledged that some gifts to IOC members cost more 
than the $200 limit. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the gifts were ``within the range of customary  
exchanges'' made by competing cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter, released Monday, said a local investigation found no  
evidence in Atlanta's bid of improper inducements, scholarship 
programs, associations with agents or excessive visits to Atlanta 
by IOC members or their families. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe there was no wrongdoing on the part of the IOC  
members or the (Atlanta bid committee) during the bid process for 
the 1996 games,'' he wrote. ``Atlanta won the games 'fair and 
square' in an honorable manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payne said the U.S. Olympic Committee has no plans to  
investigate Atlanta's campaign to win the 1996 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, USOC Executive Director Dick Schultz said that  
revelations by Charlie Battle, the former vice president for 
international affairs for the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic 
Games, might warrant another look at Atlanta's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Battle admitted last month that Atlanta officials routinely  
violated the $200 gift limit, but insisted that there was no 
wrongdoing because IOC rules were vague and other bid cities were 
doing the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was never any effort or intent to abuse the process or  
to do anything which we felt was not the right thing to do,'' 
Battle said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC investigation of the 1996-2004 bid cities was launched  
following the bribery scandal that tarnished Salt Lake City's 
winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC will review the reports it requested from about two  
dozen bid cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The inquiry, meanwhile, is not expected to expedite the release  
of records detailing Atlanta's bid process, which have been housed 
at the Atlanta History Center since 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've always said that when the records have been properly  
documented and archived, we will make the records germane to the 
historical legacy of the Atlanta Olympics open to the public,'' 
said Atlanta Olympic Committee spokesman Lee Echols.

<HEADLINE> Brit Campaigns Vs.Euro Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A former foreign secretary launched a campaign  
Monday to stop Britain from adopting the euro, saying it could 
limit his country's ability to support the United States 
independently, such as joining air strikes against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to see the British prime minister still able to come  
out of No. 10 Downing Street ... and say that we are supporting the 
foreign policy initiative of the United States, in the full 
knowledge that it was not supported by France or by Germany,'' 
David Owen told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Owen was foreign secretary from 1977 to 1979 in a Labor Party  
administration. In 1981, he co-founded what is now the 
third-running Liberal Democratic Party. He is now a member of the 
unelected upper House of Lords and has no party affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
	He formed the group called New Europe with two other ex-Cabinet  
ministers now in the Lords, Laborite Denis Healey and Conservative 
Jim Prior. 
</P>
<P>
	The move reflected heightened debate as Prime Minister Tony  
Blair's Labor Party signals it is increasingly likely to call a 
referendum in 2002 and recommend that Britain adopt the new 
European currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain is the only major European Union economy that has not  
adopted the euro, launched by 11 of the 15 EU countries on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The main opposition Conservative Party, which rules out adopting  
the euro for nearly a decade and perhaps more, said Monday it will 
boycott permanently an all-party advisory group on preparations for 
the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tory nominee quit the group last week after Blair announced  
a multimillion dollar plan, including adapting the big government 
computers, to be ready for a changeover to the euro if a referendum 
is favorable.

<HEADLINE> Spelling's 'Melrose Place' Canceled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Goodbye was too hard to say for Aaron  
Spelling. 
</P>
<P>
	After his steamy Fox TV drama ``Melrose Place'' was canceled,  
the producer couldn't tell the actors and crew in person. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't go on the set this time. It's the first time I  
haven't gone on the set. I wrote everyone a little note,'' Spelling 
told the syndicated TV show ``Hard Copy'' in an interview for 
broadcast today. 
</P>
<P>
	Spelling has visited the set to tell stars of the such shows as  
``Charlie's Angels'' and ``Dynasty'' that the series was over. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I ever get used to it, if it's not emotional, I'll quit the  
business because that means you don't care,'' Spelling said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the talk of television with its attractive cast and steamy  
plot twists, ``Melrose Place'' fell on hard times in the ratings. 
Its stars include Heather Locklear, Jamie Luner, Thomas Calabro and 
husband-and-wife actors Josie Bissett and Rob Estes.

<HEADLINE> Court Affirms $112M for Hughes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to lift a $112  
million award the federal government was ordered to pay Hughes 
Aircraft Co. in a 26-year patent dispute over satellite technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, without comment, turned away the government's  
argument that the system it used for controlling satellites was 
different from Hughes' patented system. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes sued the federal government in 1973, accusing it of  
unauthorized use of a patented Hughes system for controlling 
satellites' orientation in space. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. Court of Federal Claims judge initially ruled for the  
government. But a federal appeals court reversed, saying that under 
a patent rule known as the ``doctrine of equivalents,'' the two 
devices were similar enough to find that the government infringed 
the Hughes patent. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial judge then ordered the government in 1994 to pay  
Hughes about $112 million, and a federal appeals court upheld the 
award. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unrelated 1997 case, the Supreme Court upheld the doctrine  
of equivalents rule and said lower courts should apply it by 
focusing on whether individual elements of a product or process are 
similar to a patented invention. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court reaffirmed its ruling in the Hughes case after  
being ordered by the justices to reconsider it in light of their 
1997 ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, the government argued that  
procedural moves by Hughes in obtaining the patent gave up its 
right to claim that some parts of the government's satellite 
orientation system were similar to the Hughes system. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the government and Hughes systems ``may both achieve  
the same overall result of orienting satellites, they have quite 
different elements and those elements perform their different 
functions in different ways,'' Justice Department lawyers 
contended. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes' lawyers said the differences between the two systems are  
``insignificant differences resulting from the use of more modern 
computer technology'' in the government's system. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes did not give up its right to argue the two systems are  
similar, its lawyers added. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is U.S. vs. Hughes Aircraft Co., 98-871.

<HEADLINE> Are These Golfers Interesting?  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	This week's truth-in-advertising award goes to the bosses at the  
PGA Tour, whose slogan anticipated by a few weeks the very 
possibility that Jeff Maggert and Andrew Magee would wind up in the 
final of the Match Play Championship: ``These guys are good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No kidding.  
</P>
<P>
	But what about interesting?  
</P>
<P>
	To their relatives and a small circle of friends, no doubt. Then  
throw in golf junkies, snowbirds, retirees, the folks at Andersen 
Consulting who put up the $5 million bounty and their families, the 
folks at ABC who agreed to televise it and their families, and 
unfortunately you've pretty well exhausted the demographic for 
Sunday's telecast, the PGA's first big-time experiment with a 
match-play format in a long time. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem wasn't entirely with the golf.  
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's final was competitive enough, even skillful by turns.  
The match was tied at the end of regulation and didn't conclude 
until Maggert holed a dramatic chip-in on the second extra hole, 
from the first cut of rough just off the green, a distance of 20 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ending was pretty classic,'' Magee said. ``I even enjoyed  
it a little bit, being the weirdo I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the problem wasn't entirely with the storylines, either.  
</P>
<P>
	This wasn't like Albert Belle sneaking past Mark McGwire and  
Sammy Sosa to steal the home-run title. Both Maggert and Magee are 
deserving guys, the kind of long-suffering, thirtysomething 
journeymen the tour needs by the dozens to stay in business. They 
form the backbone, fill out the fields, contend in many places but 
win in precious few of them. And they know how to melt into the 
background at precisely the right moment. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, neither man had won since 1994, but Maggert has come  
close so often he should be certified to teach graduate-level 
courses in how to be a runner-up. He has finished second 13 times 
since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``I waited 5 1/2 years for that,'' Maggert said. ``I needed a win  
for me, myself and I.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But maybe not for the rest of us.  
</P>
<P>
	We understand that both men reached the final fair and square.  
The highest-ranked player Magee beat was No. 15 Darren Clarke, but 
he was in the same bracket as David Duval, Ernie Els and Justin 
Leonard. It wasn't his fault none of them were around when he 
showed up at the front of the parade. And Maggert took down Nick 
Price, Bernhard Langer and top-ranked Tiger Woods in 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	But if the Match Play reminded us of anything -- save that the  
tour is loaded with guys who, as the commercial touts, are good -- 
it reminded us of this: Great sporting events are defined either by 
brilliant play or transcendant personalities; and the absolutely 
best sporting events feature both. 
</P>
<P>
	This one had neither.  
</P>
<P>
	Magee said afterward that, ``If people had put blinders on and  
thought we were Tiger and David Duval, they wouldn't have known the 
difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a measure of personality, that is certainly more true of  
Duval than Woods. Both are capable of igniting a crowd with their 
golf. But while Woods' fist-pumping celebrations and club-pounding 
displays of anger are occasionally over the top, at least they 
never leave us wondering the depth of feeling that launched either 
emotion. He is in every sense -- hero or villain -- a leading man. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, it was possible to watch every moment of the  
Maggert-Magee match, as it is possible to watch Duval sometimes, 
and not know where either golfer stood for long stretches of time. 
They missed birdie putts and cringed, pulled their hats lower and 
tromped off toward the next green. They missed par putts and 
cringed, pulled their hats lower, etc. 
</P>
<P>
	There wasn't a field in pursuit, there wasn't a number in the  
clubhouse they had to get under, there wasn't ... well, the 
suspense you expect a tournament with a $1 million check for the 
winner to generate. 
</P>
<P>
	The PGA Championship abandoned match play 40 years ago and the  
tour squashed its little experiment with the format at the Tucson 
Open little more than a dozen years ago because there was no 
guarantee the marquee players would stick around to the end. 
</P>
<P>
	What persuaded commissioner Tim Finchem to bring it back with  
the world's 64 best golfers in a one-and-out format was 
percentages. He reasoned that year in, year out, the best players 
would perform well enough to yield a compelling final four most of 
the time, and a Woods-Duval extravanganza every so often. 
</P>
<P>
	Without one of those in the next year or so, the match play  
concept will run into trouble. It's expensive for one thing. And 
for another, good as these guys are, good won't be enough to make 
people tune in year after year.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Sites Targeted by US Fighters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. Air Force F-15 fighters attacked Iraqi  
military installations Sunday with bombs and missiles after planes 
patrolling the northern no-fly zone came under anti-aircraft fire, 
a U.S. military official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Targets included an Iraqi air defense headquarters, a radio  
relay site and a surface-to-air missile site, said Air Force Capt. 
Mike Blass, a Stuttgart, Germany-based spokesman for the U.S. 
European Command, which oversees the northern zone. 
</P>
<P>
	An Iraqi Oil Ministry official later said the Iraqi-Turkey oil  
pipeline was severed by an American airstrike, halting the flow of 
crude oil through the pipeline, which runs from the northern Iraqi 
field of Kirkuk to the south Turkish port of Ceyhan. 
</P>
<P>
	A Pentagon official denied the Iraqi claim.  
</P>
<P>
	The oil ministry's director of planning, Faleh al-Khaiat, told a  
press conference that a deliberate attack by American aircraft hit 
a pumping station in northern Iraq at 2:45 p.m. local time (6:45 
a.m. EST), killing one Iraqi and wounding two others seriously. 
Al-Khaiat said the man killed was an observer, employed by the 
Iraqi government, who worked with the U.N. oil-for-food program 
that monitors the flow through the pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
	And a Turkish official at the Ceyhan oil terminal, speaking on  
condition of anonymity, confirmed that the flow had stopped and 
said an attack had hit ``energy transmission lines of a 
communications center,'' which operates the pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
	But U.S. Army Col. Richard Bridges, the Pentagon's director of  
defense information, said the pipeline was neither targeted nor hit 
by allied forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no indication that we hit anything other than what we  
intended to hit, which is elements of Iraq's integrated air defense 
system,'' Bridges said. 
</P>
<P>
	Blass said the U.S. warplanes' attacks took place from about  
1:55 p.m. to 2:20 p.m. local time (5:55 a.m. to 6:20 a.m. EST). 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the official Iraqi News Agency said three people were  
killed and ``a number of people'' injured by American airstrikes. 
It identified two of the dead as Mohsin Thiab Ibrahim, a 3-year-old 
boy, and Mohammed Khamis Hussein, a shepherd. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately possible to independently confirm the  
casualty toll. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency quoted a spokesman for Iraq's air defense command as  
saying, ``Our national skies were violated by 11 enemy formations 
coming from the Turkish skies. ... They carried out 21 sorties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The black ravens flew over Nineveh, Dahuk and Irbil provinces,  
bombing some civil installations and farmers villages in Mosul,'' 
the spokesman was quoted as saying. The term ``black ravens'' 
refers to U.S. and British aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	The provinces are all in northern Iraq. Nineveh is 250 miles  
north of Baghdad. Dahuk is 285 miles and Irbil 220 miles north of 
the Iraqi capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Blass said the jets fired three air-to-ground missiles and  
dropped eight bombs in the early afternoon attacks -- three 
laser-guided bombs, two GBU-12 precision-guided bombs and three 
GBU-24 precision-guided bombs. The targets were mostly around 
Mosul, about 250 miles north of Baghdad, Blass said. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrolling allied warplanes have prevented Iraqi military  
flights over northern and southern Iraq since shortly after the 
1991 Persian Gulf War. The missions were originally launched to 
protect Kurdish rebel and Shiite Muslim groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has challenged the no-fly zones  
almost daily since the United States and Britain launched 
airstrikes in mid December to punish him for not cooperating with 
U.N. weapons inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
	In Cairo, Egypt, the Arab League on Sunday demanded that the  
United States and Britain call off their aircraft and seek a 
diplomatic solution. 
</P>
<P>
	``The secretariat-general calls on the United States of America  
and Britain to cease immediately all military acts and to resort to 
diplomatic solutions in dealing with Iraq, according to related 
(U.N.) Security Council resolutions,'' the 22-member league said in 
a statement faxed to The Associated Press.

<HEADLINE>  Flames Trade Fleury to Avalanche </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- With the acquisition of Theoren Fleury, one of the  
NHL's best teams just got better -- even if it is only for the short 
term. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado Avalanche, three years removed from a Stanley Cup  
title, regained their status as a serious Stanley Cup contender on 
Sunday by trading with the Calgary Flames for the high-scoring 
Fleury. 
</P>
<P>
	``Theo Fleury will bring some additional scoring punch to our  
hockey club and much more,'' coach Bob Hartley said. ``For many 
years in this league, he has been a proven leader and a great 
playoff performer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury, an unrestricted free agent at the end of the season,  
went to the Avalanche with winger Chris Dingman. The Flames 
received forward Rene Corbet, defenseman Wade Belak and future 
considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury, a 30-year-old wing, has spent his entire NHL career with  
the Flames, winning a Stanley Cup with the team as a rookie in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
	He has 30 goals and 39 assists this season, ranking sixth in NHL  
scoring. He has said repeatedly he wouldn't sign a new contract 
until testing the free-agent market this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury's stance on free agency might explain why the Flames  
didn't get much in return. 
</P>
<P>
	While the trade immediately bolsters the Avalanche, it hurts the  
Flames (21-29-10) in the short run. They are only two points behind 
Edmonton for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western 
Conference, but now have lost their only true star. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was an amazing opportunity that we couldn't let go by,''  
said Colorado general manager Pierre Lacroix. 
</P>
<P>
	Flames GM Al Coates agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Colorado Avalanche are a much better team today,'' he  
said. ``Theo's a great player. We're going to miss him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury, who flew into Denver on Sunday night and was met by an  
impromptu welcoming party of media, fans and curious passengers at 
Denver International Airport, said he was ``shocked'' when he was 
informed of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was tough, really tough'' to leave Calgary, he said. ``But  
I tell you, I was thrilled it was Colorado. They've got a great 
team. I think this is a great opportunity and a great situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he expected to be a rent-a-player for the playoffs or  
planned to be with Colorado beyond this season, he said, ``We'll 
see how it works out. My No. 1 focus is just hockey right now. The 
only reason why I'm here is to help this team win a Stanley Cup, 
and that's my intention. I don't think we need that distraction of 
me talking about my contract every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It isn't likely, however, that Colorado will be able to reach  
agreement with Fleury and also re-sign Peter Forsberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacroix said he wasn't deterred by Fleury's contract status.  
</P>
<P>
	``We made this transaction purely on a hockey basis,'' he said.  
``The next few months will give us a chance to talk contract with 
Theo and his agent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche lead the NHL's Northwest Division with a 30-22-8  
record but have been inconsistent. They began the year with a 1-5-1 
record, then later ran off a 12-game winning streak that was 
followed immediately by an 0-3-4 stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	With Fleury's acquisition, Lacroix said, ``I think we have the  
potential to reach the ultimate this season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury became the Flames' career scoring leader last Friday. In  
791 games, he has 364 goals and 466 assists for 830 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Calgary's Cory Stillman said Fleury is ``by  
far our greatest player and he's proving it now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hartley said he hasn't decided which line Fleury will play on,  
but said the acquisition probably means the breakup of the 
Forsberg-Joe Sakic pairing that has worked well for much of this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll take some time to see who plays better with whom,''  
Hartley said. ``We have to give the players time to get adjusted to 
Theo and for him to get adjusted to us. 
</P>
<P>
	``We gave up two good players and a future prospect, but that's  
the price you pay in this business. It's a great move.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sakic said Fleury ``makes us that much better. I think what it  
really does is give us two solid lines. He's an exciting player who 
is great with the puck and is a sparkplug out there. Obviously, we 
feel that with this trade we have a great chance to win the Stanley 
Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Right wing Adam Deadmarsh called Fleury ``one of the best  
players in the league -- one of the top 15 players, I'd say, for 
sure. Who wouldn't want him on their team?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defenseman Adam Foote said Fleury ``gives us two huge lines now  
and just strengthens the whole team. He's an offensive threat, a 
natural goal scorer, and he's also going to bring leadership and 
experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dingman, an enforcer, has played only two games this season.  
</P>
<P>
	Corbet, 25, has eight goals and 14 assists in 53 games, but is  
currently sidelined with a strained hamstring. Belak, a 22-year-old 
prospect who was a No. 1 draft pick in 1994, had no points while 
appearing briefly in 22 games this season with the Avalanche. He 
currently is playing for Colorado's American Hockey League 
affiliate in Hershey, Pa.

<HEADLINE>  Flames Trade Fleury to Avalanche </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- With the acquisition of Theoren Fleury, one of the  
NHL's best teams just got better -- even if it is only for the short 
term. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado Avalanche, three years removed from a Stanley Cup  
title, regained their status as a serious Stanley Cup contender on 
Sunday by trading with the Calgary Flames for the high-scoring 
Fleury. 
</P>
<P>
	``Theo Fleury will bring some additional scoring punch to our  
hockey club and much more,'' coach Bob Hartley said. ``For many 
years in this league, he has been a proven leader and a great 
playoff performer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury, an unrestricted free agent at the end of the season,  
went to the Avalanche with winger Chris Dingman. The Flames 
received forward Rene Corbet, defenseman Wade Belak and future 
considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury, a 30-year-old wing, has spent his entire NHL career with  
the Flames, winning a Stanley Cup with the team as a rookie in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
	He has 30 goals and 39 assists this season, ranking sixth in NHL  
scoring. He has said repeatedly he wouldn't sign a new contract

<HEADLINE> Canada: No Federal Funds for Expos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAINT-HUBERT, Quebec (AP) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean  
Chretien says his federal government will not step in to help save 
the Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not in the business of helping sports teams,'' Chretien  
said Monday, noting the government did not step in when Winnipeg 
and Quebec City lost their NHL franchises. ``We have decided not to 
intervene.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard has also refused government aid.  
</P>
<P>
	Baseball commissioner Bud Selig has given the Expos until  
Saturday to find a new ownership group and finalize plans for a new 
downtown baseball stadium. If the deadline passes, Selig may give 
the Expos' current ownership permission to negotiate with groups in 
Washington, D.C., and Northern Virginia who seek a team. 
</P>
<P>
	Chretien said the land proposed for a new ballpark belongs to  
the federal government, but he said no formal offer to rent or buy 
the land has been made -- at least at the political level. 
</P>
<P>
	``The land is the Canadian government's; there are people  
interested in buying, we'll see if we can accommodate them,'' the 
prime minister said.

<HEADLINE> Few First Lady's Have Sought Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton is the fifth  
presidential wife mentioned as a candidate for political office, 
but if she makes a bid for the Senate she'll be the only first lady 
to actually run. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1920s there were calls to draft President Warren  
Harding's widow, Florence, for governor of Ohio and President 
Woodrow Wilson's widow, Edith, for vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democrats wanted Eleanor Roosevelt to be the party's vice  
presidential nominee in 1948. In 1976, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, 
then a book editor in New York, briefly flirted with running for a 
Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
	These four first ladies -- urged to run after they left the White  
House -- declined the overtures. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe there were attempts to draft those women by  
considering them Mrs. Warren Harding or Mrs. Woodrow Wilson. I 
think they were being drafted as a bridge to their husbands' 
memory, a symbol of their husbands' legacy,'' said Carl Sferrazza 
Anthony, a historian of first ladies. 
</P>
<P>
	It's different with Mrs. Clinton, who is considering a bid for  
the Senate seat being vacated by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, he says. 
Mrs. Clinton is spending two days in New York City on Wednesday and 
Thursday, perhaps to test her chances. 
</P>
<P>
	``The difference with Hillary is that she is recognized and  
respected as a political figure in her own right,'' Anthony said. 
``She would not be there representing her husband. She would be 
there representing her own political sensibilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The political lineage of presidents runs deeper with sons.  
</P>
<P>
	Sons of several presidents went on to be congressmen, senators --  
even presidents themselves. On the state level, President Bush's 
son George W. Bush is governor of Texas and is considering a bid 
for the GOP presidential nomination in 2000. Another son, Jeb, is 
governor of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Mrs. Clinton has said little about the ``Draft Hillary''  
campaign. She says only that she's giving it ``careful thought,'' 
yet she's getting plenty of political advice. 
</P>
<P>
	Former New York Mayor Ed Koch says ``Run.'' Former New York  
congresswoman Geraldine Ferraro advises Mrs. Clinton to wait, run 
later for a Senate seat from Illinois and then be the Democrats' 
presidential candidate in 2008. Former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo 
wants to see her run, but also suggests she could duck elective 
office and still be a political force. ``Be Eleanor Roosevelt,'' he 
advised. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Roosevelt and Mrs. Clinton were born in different  
centuries, yet have much in common, says Myra Gutin, a historian of 
first ladies at Rider University in New Jersey. ``Both are 
politically minded. Both are widely respected, but also greatly 
criticized,'' Ms. Gutin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton, the only first lady to chair a presidential  
commission, was criticized for the secrecy in which her Task Force 
on Health Reform operated. Mrs. Roosevelt was the only first lady 
to hold a government position in her husband's administration. She 
resigned as assistant director of civilian defense after coming 
under fire. 
</P>
<P>
	After she left the White House, Mrs. Roosevelt, revered for her  
work on social issues, was appointed U.S. delegate to the newly 
formed United Nations. Then in 1948, she squelched an attempt to 
draft her as Harry Truman's running mate, preferring to stay at the 
United Nations and continue her role as a Democratic Party elder.

	Tobacco Farmers Stage 'Tractorcade'

<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- About 500 tractors snarled downtown traffic  
today in a demonstration by tobacco farmers demanding at least half 
of North Carolina's $4.6 billion share of a settlement between 
cigarette makers and 46 states. Tobacco farmers are upset by the 
prospect that their livelihood will be threatened by the $206 
billion settlement reached by the tobacco industry and the states 
late last year. The deal, which would reimburse state governments 
for the cost of treating tobacco-related illnesses, also aims at 
discouraging people from smoking.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- People who win job-discrimination lawsuits

to collect extra damages intended as punishment, the Supreme Court 
was told today. The federal job-bias law sets standards for forcing

<HEADLINE> More Americans File for Bankruptcy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More Americans filed for bankruptcy in 1998  
than ever before but the rate of increase dropped from the previous 
year, federal court officials reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1.44 million bankruptcy petitions were filed last  
year-- an increase of 38,000, or 2.7 percent, from the more than 1.4 
million filed in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Bankruptcy filings in 1997 had risen 19 percent over the 1996  
level. 
</P>
<P>
	The data from the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts  
showed that some 1.39 million individuals and 44,000 businesses 
sought protection from creditors in federal bankruptcy courts last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, about 1.35 million individuals and 54,000 businesses  
sought such protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law provides various kinds of protection for debtors.  
</P>
<P>
	The bankruptcy code's Chapter 7 lets individuals keep certain  
belongings while selling off other property to repay creditors. 
Companies that file under Chapter 7 sell off all assets and cease 
doing business. 
</P>
<P>
	As in past years, most bankruptcy filings -- 1.03 million -- were  
filed under Chapter 7 in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The code's Chapter 13 lets debtors repay creditors in  
installments, in full or in part, over a period of years. Nearly 
390,000 individuals and more than 8,200 companies filed under that 
chapter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 7,500 businesses invoked the code's Chapter 11 last  
year, which allowed them to reorganize and continue operations 
while devising a plan to pay off debts. 
</P>
<P>
	The bankruptcy code's Chapter 12, designed to meet the needs of  
financially distressed family farmers, was used in 807 filings last 
year. That's the lowest total in recent years, down from 949 in 
1997 and 1,083 in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Cos. To Link Appliances To Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Fifteen top technology companies agreed to  
create a common technical standard to easily link a future 
generation of gadgets and appliances to each other and the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement announced Monday could hasten the day when people  
commonly use their home phones to access the Internet, or have 
refrigerators and other appliances remotely checked by 
manufacturers for defects. 
</P>
<P>
	The participants in the group, called the Open Service Gateway  
Specification, include International Business Machines Corp., 
Motorola Corp., Sun Microsystems Inc., Lucent Technologies and 
Oracle Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The new standard, based on Sun's Java universal programming  
language, is intended to help speed the development of networked 
consumer devices, which today follow a hodgepodge of software 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
	By creating devices to a single specification, the manufacturers  
and software developers hope to make linking digital gizmos to 
computer networks as easy as plugging a telephone into a wall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each one of these applications had its own industry and  
working group and standard,'' said Eric Brown, an industry analyst 
with Forrester Research, based in Boston. ``It's becoming clear 
there's an opportunity to connect everything to everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other members of the group are Alcatel, Cable &AMP; Wireless,  
Electricite de France, Enron Communications, Ericsson, Network 
Computer Inc., Nortel Networks, Philips Electronics, Sybase and 
Toshiba. 
</P>
<P>
	One noticeable no-show was Microsoft Corp., the largest maker of  
computer software which is pushing its dominant Windows as the 
operating system for future Internet gizmos. Microsoft's absence 
could hamper the widespread acceptance of a new standard from the 
group.

<HEADLINE> Unabomber Compares Brother to Judas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In a new book, Theodore Kaczynski denies being  
mentally ill, refuses to acknowledge that he is the Unabomber and 
rails against the brother who turned him in, comparing him to 
Judas. 
</P>
<P>
	``My brother is another Judas Iscariot, except that, unlike the  
original Judas, he doesn't even have enough courage to go hang 
himself,'' he writes in ``Truth Versus Lies,'' due out this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	A story about the 548-page manuscript appeared Monday in The New  
York Times. The publisher, Context Books, said no other copies 
would be released. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaczynski's brother, David, contacted authorities after  
recognizing similarities between his brother's writings and the 
Unabomber manifesto published in newspapers. He has said it was an 
agonizing decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaczynski says in the book that instead of turning him in, his  
brother should have sent him a message threatening to expose him. 
``If I were the Unabomber,'' he writes, ``that would have been an 
effective deterrent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He says he would forgive his brother if he left his wife and  
joined the fight against modern society by ``environmental 
radicals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The book barely mentions the Unabomber's crimes but occasionally  
seems to try to burnish his image, the Times said. The book 
disputes a news report that the Unabomber once panicked when he was 
spotted dropping off a deadly parcel. 
</P>
<P>
	Any royalties earned from the book will be distributed among  
Kaczynski's victims, as required under his plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaczynski, who lived as a recluse in a Montana cabin before  
being caught, was sentenced to life without parole for conducting 
an anti-technology bombing campaign that killed three people and 
injured 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaczynski pleaded guilty to avoid a trial at which his lawyer  
had planned to offer an insanity defense. The theme of the book, 
according to the Times, is that contrary to what his lawyers 
contended, Kaczynski is not mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
	The guilty plea also saved him from the death penalty, but  
Kaczynski says in the book that ``imprisonment to me is an 
unspeakable humiliation. ... I would unhesitatingly choose death 
over incarceration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He contends that his family agreed to a mental-illness defense  
to hide their abuse of him when he was a child, according to the 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Bisceglie, a lawyer for David Kaczynski and their  
mother, Wanda, told the Times that investigators looked at the 
abuse allegation and concluded that it was false. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is symptomatic of Ted's illness,'' he said, ``and it is  
not uncommon in schizophrenia for this kind of nasty, angry, 
unpleasant striking out to occur.''

<HEADLINE> Hartwig Sets U.S. Pole Vault Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Jeff Hartwig knows how it feels to be a nobody.  
He doesn't have to worry about that anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	Hartwig now can boast about how he bettered his own American  
indoor record in the pole vault, going over the bar at 19 feet, 5 
inches in the USA Championships on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Another record-breaker was Rohsaan Griffin, who set the American  
mark in the men's 200 meters in 20.32 seconds, breaking the record 
of 20.40 shared by 1997 world champion Kevin Little and Jeff 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, there were some upsets, including defeats for  
sprinter Maurice Greene, high jumper Charles Austin and shot putter 
John Godina. 
</P>
<P>
	Hartwig, who never vaulted more than 15 feet in high school or  
18 feet in college, finally broke the 19-foot barrier in 1996, 
barely making it at 19-0 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he's a marked man entering this weekend's world  
championships in Maebashi, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started to feel a little bit of that towards the end of the  
season last year,'' said the 31-year-old from Jonesboro, Ark., who 
raises boa constrictors and pythons for sale to pet stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the past, I've always sort of had to beg and plead to get  
into meets and all of a sudden the tables have turned a little 
bit,'' he said after erasing the mark of 19-4 3/4 he set last month at 
Reno. He then missed three times at 19-8 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I'd make it. If there's any disappointment at all,  
that's it,'' said Hartwig. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, Hartwig will be up against a tough field, including  
Maksim Tarasov, the Russian who has this season's indoor best of 
19-8 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely feel I have to step it up a notch. My jump is  
still only the second best in the world this year,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranked No. 2 in the world last year, when he established the  
American outdoor record of 19-8 1/4, Hartwig has cleared 19 feet in 22 
meets, surpassing the record of 20 held by Sergei Bubka, the world 
indoor and outdoor record-holder. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffin, the 1996 NCAA champion from LSU, edged Little at the  
finish. Little was runner-up at 20.41. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't realize I had run that fast,'' said Griffin. ``It was  
a surprise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other surprises were the showing of Greene, the world's  
top-ranked sprinter, who finished second in the 60. Austin, the 
1996 Olympic gold medalist, and Godina were third in their 
specialties. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene missed his world record by .01 second in winning his  
semifinal in 6.40 seconds. In the final, a bad start cost him. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Harden, last year's first-place finisher who later was  
disqualified after testing positive for ephedrine and was suspended 
for three months, beat Greene in 6.44. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene said he slightly injured his left hamstring during the  
semifinals but decided to run the final, perhaps cautiously. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I'd run on guts and see what happened,'' said  
Greene, who indicated he would be ready for the Japan 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Austin, the 1996 Olympic champion and 1997 world indoor  
champion, cleared only 7-3. Little-known Henry Patterson and 
Stephen Smith cleared 7-6 1/2, but Patterson won on fewer misses. 
</P>
<P>
	Godina, the world's No. 1 shot putter the past two years, won  
the silver medal in the 1996 Olympics and the past two world 
outdoor titles. He was unbeaten in 17 meets last year and was 
undefeated in 24 meets since July 1997. He was voted USA Track &AMP; 
Field's top male athlete of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	He managed a best of only 67-6 3/4, finishing behind Andy Bloom,  
with a career-best 68-3 3/4, and C.J. Hunter, who reached 67-7 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter's wife, Marion Jones, the world's leading sprinter, said  
her husband, who injured his right shoulder on his final attempt, 
would not go to Japan, putting Godina on the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Gail Devers, inactive from last May until this month  
because of an Achilles tendon injury, won her fourth consecutive 
race, taking the women's 60 in 7.04. Devers, the two-time world 
indoor champion and two-time Olympic gold medalist at 100 meters, 
got in from Stockholm at 4 p.m. on Friday and got little sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had exactly 1 hour and 12 minutes of sleep last night,'' she  
said. ``I couldn't sleep, so I just got up and got on my 
computer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Angelo Taylor, a junior at Georgia Tech, edged Milt Campbell to  
win the men's 400 in 45.50, fastest in the world this year. Taylor 
will not make the trip to the world championships, staying home to 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	Reggie Torian remained unbeaten this season, winning the  
60-meter hurdles in 7.38, the best in the world and a meet record. 
</P>
<P>
	Lance Deal won his 11th title in the 35-pound weight throw at  
77-11 1/2 to become the winningest male athlete in meet history. 
</P>
<P>
	Meet records fell in three women's events: Dawn Ellerbe won her  
fourth straight 20-pound weight throw with a heave of 74-8 1/4; 
Melissa Morrison won the 60 hurdles in 7.85; and Stacy Dragila won 
her fourth straight pole vault title at 14-7 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Adam Goucher captured the 3,000 in 7:46.06, the fastest by an  
American this year, and Tisha Waller won her third indoor high jump 
title at 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Jearl Miles-Clark, the 1997 world indoor champion in the women's  
400, won her third straight national title and fourth overall, in 
51.97.

<HEADLINE> Flames Trade Fleury to Avalanche </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- With the acquisition of Theoren Fleury, one of the  
NHL's best teams just got better -- even if it is only for the short 
term. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado Avalanche, three years removed from a Stanley Cup  
title, regained their status as a serious Stanley Cup contender on 
Sunday by trading with the Calgary Flames for the high-scoring 
Fleury. 
</P>
<P>
	``Theo Fleury will bring some additional scoring punch to our  
hockey club and much more,'' coach Bob Hartley said. ``For many 
years in this league, he has been a proven leader and a great 
playoff performer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury, an unrestricted free agent at the end of the season,  
went to the Avalanche with winger Chris Dingman. The Flames 
received forward Rene Corbet, defenseman Wade Belak and future 
considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury, a 30-year-old wing, has spent his entire NHL career with  
the Flames, winning a Stanley Cup with the team as a rookie in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
	He has 30 goals and 39 assists this season, ranking sixth in NHL  
scoring. He has said repeatedly he wouldn't sign a new contract 
until testing the free-agent market this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury's stance on free agency might explain why the Flames  
didn't get much in return. 
</P>
<P>
	While the trade immediately bolsters the Avalanche, it hurts the  
Flames (21-29-10) in the short run. They are only two points behind 
Edmonton for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western 
Conference, but now have lost their only true star. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was an amazing opportunity that we couldn't let go by,''  
said Colorado general manager Pierre Lacroix. 
</P>
<P>
	Flames GM Al Coates agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Colorado Avalanche are a much better team today,'' he  
said. ``Theo's a great player. We're going to miss him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury, who flew into Denver on Sunday night and was met by an  
impromptu welcoming party of media, fans and curious passengers at 
Denver International Airport, said he was ``shocked'' when he was 
informed of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was tough, really tough'' to leave Calgary, he said. ``But  
I tell you, I was thrilled it was Colorado. They've got a great 
team. I think this is a great opportunity and a great situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he expected to be a rent-a-player for the playoffs or  
planned to be with Colorado beyond this season, he said, ``We'll 
see how it works out. My No. 1 focus is just hockey right now. The 
only reason why I'm here is to help this team win a Stanley Cup, 
and that's my intention. I don't think we need that distraction of 
me talking about my contract every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It isn't likely, however, that Colorado will be able to reach  
agreement with Fleury and also re-sign Peter Forsberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacroix said he wasn't deterred by Fleury's contract status.  
</P>
<P>
	``We made this transaction purely on a hockey basis,'' he said.  
``The next few months will give us a chance to talk contract with 
Theo and his agent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche lead the NHL's Northwest Division with a 30-22-8  
record but have been inconsistent. They began the year with a 1-5-1 
record, then later ran off a 12-game winning streak that was 
followed immediately by an 0-3-4 stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	With Fleury's acquisition, Lacroix said, ``I think we have the  
potential to reach the ultimate this season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury became the Flames' career scoring leader last Friday. In  
791 games, he has 364 goals and 466 assists for 830 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Calgary's Cory Stillman said Fleury is ``by  
far our greatest player and he's proving it now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hartley said he hasn't decided which line Fleury will play on,  
but said the acquisition probably means the breakup of the 
Forsberg-Joe Sakic pairing that has worked well for much of this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll take some time to see who plays better with whom,''  
Hartley said. ``We have to give the players time to get adjusted to 
Theo and for him to get adjusted to us. 
</P>
<P>
	``We gave up two good players and a future prospect, but that's  
the price you pay in this business. It's a great move.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sakic said Fleury ``makes us that much better. I think what it  
really does is give us two solid lines. He's an exciting player who 
is great with the puck and is a sparkplug out there. Obviously, we 
feel that with this trade we have a great chance to win the Stanley 
Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Right wing Adam Deadmarsh called Fleury ``one of the best  
players in the league -- one of the top 15 players, I'd say, for 
sure. Who wouldn't want him on their team?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defenseman Adam Foote said Fleury ``gives us two huge lines now  
and just strengthens the whole team. He's an offensive threat, a 
natural goal scorer, and he's also going to bring leadership and 
experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dingman, an enforcer, has played only two games this season.  
</P>
<P>
	Corbet, 25, has eight goals and 14 assists in 53 games, but is  
currently sidelined with a strained hamstring. Belak, a 22-year-old 
prospect who was a No. 1 draft pick in 1994, had no points while 
appearing briefly in 22 games this season with the Avalanche. He 
currently is playing for Colorado's American Hockey League 
affiliate in Hershey, Pa.

<HEADLINE> Obasanjo Elected Nigerian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) -- Former Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo was elected  
president of Nigeria, election officials said today, paving the way 
for the return of a civilian leader to Africa's most populous 
nation after 15 years of military rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, voter fraud and other electoral irregularities cast a  
shadow on the elections. Aides to former Finance Minister Olu 
Falae, Obasanjo's opponent, said Falae would contest the results. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy, which included charges of ballot-box stuffing,  
did not immediately spark public protests. No violence was reported 
on the streets of Lagos, often a hotbed of strife in times of 
political dissent. 
</P>
<P>
	Obasanjo captured 63 percent of the ballots in Saturday's vote,  
according to Nigeria's Independent National Electoral Commission 
chief Justice Ephraim Akpata. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to journalists in a hotel room filled with aides and  
well-wishers today, Obasanjo pledged to nurture democracy in 
Nigeria, a nation twice the size of California long under the rule 
of the military. 
</P>
<P>
	``An election is not the end of democracy,'' he said.  
``Democracy, under my leadership, will continue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without elaborating, Obasanjo said he was involved in ongoing  
talks with ``all people'' to ``advance the cause of democracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Corruption and mismanagement have cost the country of 110  
million people billions of dollars of its massive oil wealth, 
leaving much of Nigeria's infrastructure crumbling, with 
electricity and water service largely unknown in many cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Nigeria's democratic transition began last June, when the  
five-year-dictatorship of Gen. Sani Abacha ended with his sudden 
death. Abacha was followed by Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, who has 
repeatedly vowed to hand over power to a civilian government. 
</P>
<P>
	Abubakar is to turn over power to the new civilian president on  
May 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Obasanjo's rival, Falae, however, believes the elections were  
rigged. 
</P>
<P>
	Yusaf Mamman, a spokesman for Falae, said today the two  
political parties backing Falae had agreed not to accept the 
election results. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is like a burial ceremony. People are in mourning,'' Mamman  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	International observers cited out ballot-box stuffing among  
other voting problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our delegation members and others witnessed serious  
irregularities and overt electoral fraud in a number of states,'' 
said former President Jimmy Carter, who led a 60-person delegation 
of election observers. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter, added, though, that ``a saving factor was that there was  
no nationwide pattern to favor any one party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those monitors were to release a detailed report on the  
elections later today. 
</P>
<P>
	Obasanjo admitted election irregularities occurred in some  
areas, but said they were committed by ``ignorant'' people and 
should not influence the international community to sway their 
opinion of the end result. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe there is anywhere in the world where elections  
are conducted by human beings that are perfect. And Nigeria would 
not be an exception,'' Obasanjo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nigeria has never held a presidential election in which the  
loser accepted defeat. In both previous presidential elections, in 
1979 and 1993, the apparent result was contested by at least one of 
the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	To officially challenge the election, Falae's party would have  
to file suit with Nigeria's Court of Appeal, a process that could 
take months. 
</P>
<P>
	Obasanjo's People's Democratic Party already earned a majority  
of seats in the National Assembly after elections only days before 
the presidential tally. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's presidential elections marked the start of the final  
phase of this former British colony's transition back to civilian 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
	While both Obasanjo and Falae are Yorubas, the dominant people  
in Nigeria's southwest, Obasanjo's military past has alienated him 
from many southerners. 
</P>
<P>
	Obasanjo voluntarily handed over power to civilian rule in 1979.  
But a military junta seized back power in 1983 and various military 
rulers have held power since, canceling the results of the 1993 
vote.

<HEADLINE> White Supremacists To Go on Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A few years ago, a band of white men  
hatched what authorities say was a sinister plot: to overthrow the 
federal government and establish the Aryan Peoples Republic in the 
Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	During their mission, they allegedly stockpiled military-style  
weapons and robbed and murdered several people, including an 
Arkansas couple and their 8-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, two of the alleged group members, Chevie Kehoe, 26, of  
Colville, Wash., and Danny Lee, 26, of Yukon, Okla., are scheduled 
to go on trial. They are charged in a five-count indictment, 
alleging racketeering, conspiracy and murder. If convicted, they 
could be sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-eyed Chevie Kehoe, associated himself years ago with  
the Christian Identity, a white supremacist movement. To his local 
newspaper in Colville, he wrote: ``We are in the schools, 
government, law enforcement, health and everywhere you look. 
Someone's scared and it is not us.... We are not afraid to die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 15, 1997, Chevie and his brother Cheyne Kehoe became  
notorious outlaws after a shootout with police near Wilmington, 
Ohio. The gunplay was caught on videotape and broadcast around the 
nation. No officers were hurt, but a passer-by was wounded by a 
bullet fragment. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers were indicted by an Ohio grand jury and a  
nationwide manhunt began. Four months later, Cheyne Kehoe turned 
himself in and told police where to find his brother in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheyne Kehoe, 22, also from Colville, was convicted last year in  
the Ohio case of attempted murder, felonious assault and carrying a 
concealed weapon. He was sentenced to 24 1/2 years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
	In Ohio, Chevie Kehoe pleaded guilty Feb. 20, 1998, to attempted  
murder of a police officer, felonious assault and carrying a 
concealed weapon. The judge deferred sentencing until the Arkansas 
case is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Arkansas case, Kehoe and Lee are accused of the murders  
of gun dealer William Mueller, 52; his wife, Nancy Mueller, 28; and 
her 8-year-old daughter, Sarah Elizabeth Powell. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal authorities say Chevie Kehoe and his father, Kirby  
Kehoe, stockpiled guns in Spokane, Wash., and supplied weapons to a 
white supremacist gang that committed 22 bank robberies in the 
Midwest.

stolen from Mueller were brought to Spokane and stored in a garage

<HEADLINE> Pacifier Use Lessens Breast Feeding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Babies who use pacifiers spend less time  
breast-feeding and are weaned off the breast sooner, which might be 
convenient for Mom but not ideal for the child's health, 
researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	In a study of 265 breast-feeding mothers in upstate New York,  
infants who used pacifiers were breast-fed eight times a day on 
average, compared with nine times a day among babies not given the 
option of sucking an artificial nipple. Pacifier-sucking babies 
also spent less time overall breast-feeding. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, mothers who turned to pacifiers weaned their babies  
off the breast one month earlier than those who relied solely on 
breast-feeding. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason, the researchers said, is that pacifiers satisfy  
babies' innate need to suck. 
</P>
<P>
	With less frequent breast-feedings, a mother's milk supply tends  
to decrease, often leading her to add formula or solid foods to her 
child's diet sooner. 
</P>
<P>
	The authors of the study, published in this month's issue of the  
journal Pediatrics, said that mothers should be careful not to give 
children pacifiers until breast-feeding is well-established. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you substitute the pacifier for the breast, your milk  
supply is going to go down. And it's really important for your 
baby's health that your baby be breast-fed as long as possible,'' 
said Dr. Cynthia R. Howard, a professor of pediatrics at the 
University of Rochester. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Academy of Pediatrics says breast-feeding is  
thought to decrease infant ear infections, allergies, diarrhea and 
bacterial meningitis and even more serious illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The research, considered the first of its kind in the United  
States, bolsters three recent studies in Brazil that had similar 
findings, said Lawrence Gartner, chairman of the academy's work 
group on breast-feeding. 
</P>
<P>
	About 62 percent of American women breast-feed.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Warned About Games Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Federal Bureau of Investigation chief  
Louis Freeh says Sydney's 2000 Olympic Games could be the target of 
an attack by Islamic terrorist Osama Bin Laden. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeh, in Australia giving advice on law and order issues, made  
his comments on Channel Nine television Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if Sydney was at risk of attack by Bin Laden because  
of the large contingent of U.S. athletes and spectators attending 
the event, Freeh replied ``exactly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``His threat, or Fatwah, (is) against not only Americans but the  
friends of America who we believe are clearly most of the world, 
and certainly our very close friends here in this part of the 
world,'' Freeh said. 
</P>
<P>
	``So I think the Olympics, APEC, the America's Cup -- these are  
all opportunities for someone who has a terrorist agenda to take 
advantage of an opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The APEC meeting of Asia Pacific leaders and the America's Cup  
yacht race will both be held in Auckland, New Zealand later this 
year.

<HEADLINE> Gore Says L.A. May Host Democrats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore said Monday he is  
optimistic that Democrats can reach a deal with Los Angeles for 
hosting the party's national convention next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, who has formed an exploratory committee for seeking the  
party's presidential nomination, acknowledged in an interview with 
The Associated Press he has lavished attention on California and 
its 54 electoral votes and cornucopia of political donors. 
</P>
<P>
	On four separate occasions -- ``so far,'' he said -- Gore has  
capitalized on the office he holds to announce federal aid to 
farmers and workers hurt by a citrus freeze in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``California is our largest state; it is deserving of more  
attention than any other state,'' he said. ``And that's what I give 
it on a regular basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic National Committee signaled last month that it  
preferred Los Angeles over Boston and Denver for hosting the 
party's 2000 convention. However, both party and city officials 
have acknowledged that a deal between them is far from complete. 
</P>
<P>
	``The negotiations are in a very active phase,'' Gore said  
Monday. ``I can tell you I'm very optimistic (but) it's not fait 
accompli.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore talked to the AP after focusing on welfare in a series of  
public meetings in the San Francisco Bay area on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	He used some tough-love rhetoric, saying, ``Welfare should be a  
second chance, not a way of life.'' But he also indicated support 
for taking advantage of the strong economy to move people from 
welfare to jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This time, we mustn't leave people behind,'' Gore said at San  
Francisco's City Hall, drawing an implicit contrast to government 
priorities during the economic boom of the 1980s under President 
Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can't help those who are most in need of jobs in this  
kind of economy, then when can we do it?'' Gore said. ``This is a 
bright moment for our country and we must use it to maximum 
effect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 10,000 businesses have received federal tax credits for  
participating in the nonprofit Welfare to Work Partnership, hiring 
more than 410,000 welfare recipients since May, he said.

<HEADLINE> Manhattan Fires Basketball Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- John Leonard, who had a 26-57 record in his  
three years at Manhattan College, including 5-22 this season, was 
fired Monday with two years remaining on his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard, a 1982 graduate of Manhattan and the seventh leading  
scorer in school history, didn't have a .500 season at his alma 
mater with a 12-17 record in 1997-98 his best record. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic director Bob Byrnes said the remainder of Leonard's  
contract would be honored and the terms of the severance were still 
being worked on. He said the process of choosing a successor would 
begin immediately and current assistant Matt Kilcullen, a former 
head coach at Western Kentucky, would be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard, an assistant to Steve Lappas for four years at  
Manhattan and another four at Villanova, succeeded Fran Fraschilla 
at Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jaspers were beaten 73-46 by Rider last Friday in the  
opening round of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference tournament 
and Byrnes said then that a meeting between he and Leonard was 
scheduled for Monday. Byrnes had said he felt there was enough 
talent on this season's team for at least 10 wins. 
</P>
<P>
	Kilcullen was hired in December after first-year assistants Sean  
Cleary and Marc Turner resigned on the same day citing personal 
reasons.

<HEADLINE> Chimp Attacks Utah Zoo Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A zoo worker lost a finger and part of his  
nose when an escaped chimpanzee attacked him and another employee. 
Zoo officials killed the chimp and one of its companions. 
</P>
<P>
	A former zoo employee said officials ignored warnings to keep  
the seriously injured worker away from the chimps because the 
animals behaved violently whenever he was around. 
</P>
<P>
	Male chimps Chip and Happy and female Tammy escaped from their  
cage Saturday and ran into a service area, where Chip attacked 
Jamie Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley lost one finger, part of another finger and part of his  
nose, and suffered bites and scratches all over his body. Kim 
Tropea, 35, the zoo's new primate supervisor, threw herself on 
Bradley and suffered cuts and scrapes during the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Other zoo employees fired shotguns at both Chip and Happy, who  
charged at one worker. Both animals had to be euthanized, zoo 
executive director Craig Dinsmore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Former primate worker Marjorie Jones, who quit a day before the  
attack, said she had warned zoo officials to keep Bradley away from 
the chimps because they disliked him for unknown reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Dinsmore said the warnings were not ignored and Bradley ``was  
not near the chimps. He couldn't be seen by the chimps until they 
got out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, 28, was upgraded from critical condition to fair after  
surgery, said University Hospital spokesman John Dwan.

<HEADLINE> Gov't OKs Flight Services Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department approved the nation's  
largest flight support services company's move to acquire a 
competitor after it agreed Monday to sell operations at airports in 
Palm Springs, Calif.; Hartford, Conn., and Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, which must still be approved by a federal judge,  
would allow Signature Flight Support Corp. to acquire AMR Combs 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Signature, based in Orlando, Fla., owns the nation's largest  
network of fixed flight base operations, with more than 40 
locations nationwide. AMR Combs is a subsidiary of AMR Corp. of 
Dallas, which also owns American Airlines. AMR Combs has 11 fixed 
base operations in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	In a lawsuit to block the original deal, the government argued  
that it would reduce competition and would likely push up prices 
for aviation services at the three airports. 
</P>
<P>
	To overcome those concerns, Signature agreed to sell flight  
support businesses at Palm Springs Regional Airport in California, 
Bradley International in Hartford and Denver Centennial Airport. 
The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court here along with the 
agreement designed to settle it. 
</P>
<P>
	Signature and Combs currently are the only two companies  
competing to sell such services as fueling and ramp and hangar 
space rentals at Palm Springs and Bradley. At Denver Centennial, 
Signature previously agreed to operate a flight support facility 
which would have competed with Combs when it is completed next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without these divestitures, aviation customers at Palm Springs  
and Bradley International Airport would have had to pay higher 
prices for jet fuel and other services,'' said Assistant Attorney 
General Joel I. Klein, head of Justice's antitrust division. 
``Customers at Denver Centennial Airport would not have experienced 
the benefits that competition from a third independent fixed based 
operator would bring to that airport.''

<HEADLINE> `60 Minutes' Follows Up Suicide Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Relatives of a man whose suicide at the hands of  
Dr. Jack Kevorkian was aired on ``60 Minutes'' last fall said they 
were upset with the show's follow-up segment, which focused on sick 
people who oppose assisted suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	The CBS newsmagazine show has come under fire from all sides.  
Many viewers spoke out against the November segment, which aired a 
video of Kevorkian apparently giving a lethal injection to Thomas 
Youk, a Waterford Township man with Lou Gehrig's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Now some are questioning the timing of the Sunday night segment,  
which came less than a week after ``60 Minutes'' correspondent Mike 
Wallace said at a symposium that he had second thoughts about 
airing the suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	During Sunday's story, one patient in a Connecticut hospice  
responded affirmatively when asked by Wallace whether she thought 
Youk had ``simply wimped out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just very upset in the way they handled the whole  
segment of the program,'' Youk's brother, Robert, said in today's 
editions of the Detroit Free Press. ``I thought they were going to 
show both sides, not just completely slanted to the other side from 
what Dr. Kevorkian was trying to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have got to be knowledgeable about where he was at that  
point in time,'' Youk said of his brother. ``He was in a very grave 
situation, and I believe he made the right choice, and we abided by 
that choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A man who suffers from the disease said the shows simply laid  
out both points of view. However, Edgar Sullivan, 55, of St. Clair 
Shores, said the Kevorkian tape bothered him and that he opposes 
assisted suicide for himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of mood swings, ups and downs, and it gets to  
the point where you might feel bad all the time. Every patient is 
different,'' Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``60 Minutes'' executive producer Don Hewitt said the follow-up  
story was simply a good idea suggested to them by a viewer and is 
not a sign that the show is backing off the Kevorkian segment. It 
also doesn't indicate that producers are particularly swayed by 
public pressure, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tape of Youk's injection death has been the main piece of  
evidence used to charge Kevorkian with first-degree murder, 
assisted suicide and illegal use of a controlled substance in 
Youk's death. His trial is scheduled to begin March 22.

<HEADLINE> Personal Income Rises in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A rebound at factories and strong growth in  
Americans' incomes indicate the economy will continue to grow 
robustly as it enters its ninth straight year of expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have is an economy where the weak link is  
strengthening,'' said economist Tim O'Neill of Bank of Montreal in 
Toronto. ``That suggests for another year, another several quarters 
at least, growth will come in above forecast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reports issued Monday show:  
</P>
<P>
	--Manufacturing activity surged higher in February, ending an  
eight-month decline. 
</P>
<P>
	--Personal incomes increased a brisk 0.6 percent in January and  
spending a moderate 0.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--The strongest burst of highway and street building in 24 years  
helped power a 1.6 percent increase in construction spending in 
January, the most in seven months. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. economic expansion starts its ninth year later this  
month. Already the longest during peacetime, the expansion almost 
certainly will continue into next year, surpassing the 1961-69 run 
during the Vietnam War, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, if the growth rate stays close to last year's 3.9  
percent, Federal Reserve policy-makers might cool demand and keep 
inflation low by raising short-term interest rates during the 
second half of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect the economy to slow on its own but, if I'm wrong,  
then there will be higher interest rates this year,'' predicted 
economist Nicholas Perna of Fleet Financial Group in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Long-term interest rates in the bond market already are rising  
in anticipation. Stock prices wavered in response. After losing 
more than 83 points in the morning, the Dow Jones average of 
industrial stocks closed up 18 points at 9,325. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's manufacturing report, from the National Association of  
Purchasing Management, showed both production and orders for new 
business improved significantly last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``The manufacturing sector has bottomed out and has likely  
experienced the worst effects of the turmoil overseas,'' said 
economist Marilyn Schaja of Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	The key component of income -- wages and salaries -- rose 0.7  
percent in January, reflecting federal cost-of-living increases. 
Income in services advanced strongly but, in manufacturing, only 
modestly. 
</P>
<P>
	January's increase in consumer spending was led by a 0.8 percent  
rise in services, followed by a 0.3 percent gain in purchases of 
nondurable goods such as food and fuel. Spending on durable goods 
plunged 2.1 percent following a 3.3 percent surge in December, 
reflecting the pattern of auto buying. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact that incomes increased faster than their spending in  
January helped produce a positive U.S. savings rate for only the 
second time in five months. It was 0.1 percent in January, minus 
0.3 percent in December and 0.6 percent in November, the month when 
farmers collected the big subsidy payment. 
</P>
<P>
	The savings rate has sunk to levels last seen on a sustained  
basis during the Depression because some Americans have been 
spending money from their accumulated wealth -- stock-market gains, 
home equity -- as opposed to current income. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction was led by a 5.9 percent jump in government  
spending, the most in eight years, fueled by a 25.7 surge for 
highways and streets. 
</P>
<P>
	According to economist Lynn Reaser of Nationsbank Corp. in  
Jacksonville, Fla., local and state governments are spending 
surpluses on road building. 
</P>
<P>
	Residential construction increased 1.3 percent. However,  
commercial construction fell 1.1 percent, pulled down by drops at 
factories, other industrial facilities and at shopping centers.

<HEADLINE> Jasper Sunday Sermons Offer Comfort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- The death sentence given to a white  
supremacist for the dragging death of a black man must spur change, 
a minister told his congregation in this east Texas timber town. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have to change,'' the Rev. Ron Foshage told  
parishioners at St. Michael's Catholic Church, a group that 
included the prosecutor and the condemned man's father. ``Change 
our hearts and our minds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, a jury of 11 whites and one black sentenced John  
William King, 24, to death for the June attack on James Byrd Jr., 
49, who was killed after he was dragged by his ankles for more than 
two miles behind a pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
	As Foshage spoke at a Saturday evening mass, King's prosecutor,  
Guy James Gray, listened with bowed head, his wife, Mary, by his 
side. 
</P>
<P>
	Not 20 feet away, in another pew, sat King's ailing father,  
Ronald King. 
</P>
<P>
	``We pray for Bill King, that the Lord helps him seek  
forgiveness,'' Foshage said. ``We pray for Ronald King, who was so 
deeply humiliated and grieved. We pray for the Byrd family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ministers throughout Jasper tried to bring comfort and peace to  
congregations made weary by the nation's scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hate is still living and alive,'' the Rev. John D. Hardin  
assured his Mount Olive Missionary Baptist Church followers. ``But 
love has already won the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Byrd's parents' church, Greater New Bethel Baptist Church,  
the Rev. Kenneth Lyons also used this week's events as a sermon 
topic. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must agree this morning that a few months ago we had a very  
horrible tragedy occur in our town. It was an event that shocked 
Jasper, the country and the world,'' Lyons said. ``The men who 
committed this crime meant it for evil against a black man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Jasper United Pentecostal Church, Senior Pastor Malcolm  
Seal didn't discuss the trial in his sermon Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Several members of King's family attend the church, and Seal  
said it was sufficient that he preached about the murder right 
after it happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're human beings, and I'm concerned for their welfare as  
well. They didn't commit any crime. They're victims,'' Seal said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trials for King's co-defendants -- Lawrence Russell Brewer, 31,  
and Shawn Allen Berry, 24, have not been scheduled.

<HEADLINE> Doctor Calls for Soccer Header Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A British doctor has called for a ban on heading  
the ball in all areas of the field except the penalty box to 
protect soccer players from possible brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
	David Kernick, a medical officer with Division Three club Exeter  
City, says evidence is mounting that heading the ball repeatedly 
can cause ``mental decline,'' the British Journal of General 
Practice reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Kernick said it would be impossible to ban heading outright  
because it is an essential part of the game and ``offers an 
important dimension of play, particularly around the goalmouth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said in view of the millions of players throughout the  
world, if heading the ball caused even a slight amount of brain 
damage there would be significant health consequences. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times newspaper cited evidence to back Kernick's claims,  
including brain scans conducted on Norwegian professionals which 
revealed elevated levels of neurophysiological impairment.

<HEADLINE> Panel Says IRS Can't Balance Books </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It sounds like a taxpayer's dream: The IRS was  
audited and struggled to explain its own financial records. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IRS cannot do some of the basic accounting and  
record-keeping tasks that it expects American taxpayers to do,'' 
said Gregory Kutz, who oversaw the audit released Monday by the 
congressional General Accounting Office. 
</P>
<P>
	GAO said chronic Internal Revenue Service problems resulted last  
year in millions of dollars in fraudulent refunds, failure to keep 
track of such basic assets as cars and computers and substandard 
computer security controls.

	``Think of this as not balancing your checkbook with the monthly  
bank statement, and at the same time having a system prone to 
error,'' Kutz told the House Government Reform Committee's panel on 
government management at a Monday hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	GAO said IRS is unable to keep track of unpaid taxes properly,  
which means it cannot concentrate collection efforts on the 
taxpayers most likely to pay. The upshot is that only about $26 
billion of the $222 billion in unpaid taxes as of October 1998 are 
likely to be collected, with $119 billion -- a whopping 54 percent -- 
to be written off. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a national scandal,'' said Rep. Steve Horn, R-Calif.,  
chairman of the government management subcommittee. ``It seems to 
me you shouldn't let people off the hook like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IRS officials were quick to take responsibility for the  
problems, which they said were largely rooted in the agency's 
antiquated computer systems that date as far back as the Kennedy 
administration. They were clearly embarrassed by the report, coming 
as it does as the IRS is makes a high-profile attempt to become 
more efficient and more customer-friendly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am deeply disappointed that we failed to meet our  
obligations,'' said Donna Cunninghame, the IRS' new chief financial 
officer. ``This is unacceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO found the IRS did a good job of collecting $1.8 trillion  
in tax revenue in fiscal 1998. The main problems were found in the 
agency's administration of an $8.1 billion annual budget. They 
include: 
</P>
<P>
	--At least $17 million paid out in fraudulent and inappropriate  
refunds in the first nine months of 1998. IRS sometimes duplicates 
refunds or fails to compare tax returns with W-2 forms before they 
are mailed out within the required 45 days. Fraudulent refunds 
worth another $65 million were stopped by IRS investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	--Improper paperwork to keep track of such items as a Chevrolet  
Blazer, a $300,000 laser printer, laptop computers, televisions, 
VCRs and fax machines. Most of these were accounting errors, not 
thefts. The Blazer, for example, was returned to a leasing company 
but nobody took it off the books. 
</P>
<P>
	--Poor computer security, including controls on access to  
sensitive taxpayer information. The audit repeated past criticisms 
about the use of unarmed bicycle couriers to transport taxpayer 
checks and sluggish background checks on prospective employees with 
criminal pasts. 
</P>
<P>
	--Inadequate controls over basic financial reporting and failure  
to reconcile IRS balances with Treasury Department records. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the problems are chronic, and some lawmakers were  
frustrated that they have continued to surface annually since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see that there's been a real significant effort to  
deal with these financial management issues,'' said Rep. Jim 
Turner, D-Texas. ``The problems seem to be running pretty deep.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cunninghame, however, said the new management team at IRS is  
redoubling efforts to eliminate them. She pledged improved 
performance in fiscal 1999 but said the agency's computer systems 
must be modernized for a long-term fix. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will take time, and it won't be easy,'' she said. ``The IRS  
must replace nearly its entire inventory of computer 
applications.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the IRS awarded a multibillion-dollar contract to a  
consortium led by Computer Sciences Corp. of El Segundo, Calif., 
for a modernization project expected to last 15 years. That came 
after several previous efforts failed at a cost of some $3.3 
billion.

<HEADLINE> Dow Corning Earnings Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIDLAND, Mich. (AP) -- Dow Corning. Corp. earnings were down 21  
percent in the fourth quarter of 1998 compared to the previous 
year, due to a strong dollar and weak demand worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Profits totaled $48.4 million for the quarter, down from $61.5  
million a year before. Revenues were $639.8 million, down 4 percent 
from $668.3 million in the same period in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Dow Corning made $206.7 million, a 13 percent drop  
from $237.6 million in 1997. Revenues totaled $2.57 billion, down 3 
percent from 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The results included a one-time charge of $17.7 million after  
tax for closing offices in the Americas, Europe and Asia. The 
Midland-based company, the second-largest U.S. chemical maker 
behind DuPont, is equally owned by The Dow Chemical Co. and Corning 
Inc. More than half its sales are outside the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``The negative drag of a strong U.S. dollar and demand  
weaknesses, which began in Asia and spread to other parts of the 
world, made 1998 a challenging year,'' said John Churchfield, Dow 
Corning's chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we have yet to see any significant strengthening of  
short-term growth prospects, our underlying business remains 
healthy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The results did not include any charges related to the company's  
bankruptcy case. Once the world's largest maker of silicone breast 
implants, the company declared bankruptcy after a flood of lawsuits 
by women who claim the implants caused health problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow Corning has offered a $3.2 billion settlement plan to women  
with implants and $1.3 billion to other creditors. Voting on the 
plan begins March 15.

<HEADLINE> 24-Hour Day Care Serves Families </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) -- The waitress at the all-night  
fast-food joint. The third-shift assembly line worker. The police 
officer whose patrol starts at midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	For parents who work while others sleep, finding care for their  
kids has never been easy. But in Chattanooga, the Children's 
Home/Chambliss Center can fill the need when grandparents, baby 
sitters and friends cannot. 
</P>
<P>
	The former orphanage with a 127-year history in the city is  
among the few centers in Tennessee offering 24-hour day care. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see ourselves as one of the major cogs that keeps the  
community working and people productive,'' executive director Phil 
Acord said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1969, youngsters have been arriving at the nonprofit  
center around dinner time, teddy bears and pajamas in tow. While 
Mom or Dad works the graveyard shift, the children sleep on tiny 
cots in a room decorated with construction-paper stars. Early the 
next morning, their parents or a school bus collects them. 
</P>
<P>
	As states move to trim the welfare rolls and more people --  
especially single mothers -- enter the work force, some child 
advocates are concerned demand for around-the-clock service will 
overwhelm the few providers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Accessibility to the right kind of care for those parents in a  
global, 24-hour economy is a great struggle,'' said Michael 
Kharfen, spokesman for the U.S. Department of Human Services. 
``It's a potential growth industry, one we've encouraged states to 
look at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, only 560 such day care centers operated in 18 states,  
according to a study by The Children's Foundation, a Washington, 
D.C., child advocacy group. Another 25 states licensed 24-hour day 
care, but did not track how many were in business. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tennessee, only 30 of the nearly 6,000 day care centers offer  
24-hour service. 
</P>
<P>
	Acord, who has worked at the Children's Home for 28 years,  
understands why. Most day care workers earn minimum wage or receive 
few benefits and turnover is high. 
</P>
<P>
	Finding people qualified to staff an overnight shift is  
difficult, he said. Many for-profit day care providers often find 
it doesn't pay to stay open overnight, since demand isn't as steady 
as during traditional work hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The Children's Home draws on federal subsidies, its endowment  
and support from donors to fund the service. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 12 children, ages kindergarten to sixth grade, stay  
overnight. About 200 parents are on a waiting list, some requesting 
care during nontraditional hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The center, which also runs an emergency shelter for abused and  
neglected children, has a sliding fee scale. The average parent 
will pay about $27 per child per week, even though the cost is 
around $99. Leaving a child for days at a time is prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
	A social worker and teachers watch for problems. Parents who  
leave their children at the center for too many days each week 
usually are called in for a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Acord sees centers like his as key to the success of welfare  
reform. ``Sometimes parents have to keep odd-hour jobs to stay out 
of poverty,'' he said. ``This is child care to keep people 
working.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barbara Smith, 31, of East Ridge, a Cracker Barrel waitress who  
worked until midnight for years, used the center for eight years to 
care for her son, now 12. He would arrive around 5 p.m., nap, then 
wake up at midnight to be taken home. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were a last-chance type of thing. I didn't have a  
choice,'' she said. ``I couldn't have worked without it.''

<HEADLINE> Debt Hobbles Patriot American </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Patriot American Hospitality Corp., hobbled by  
billions of dollars in debt, plans a massive restructuring that 
will end its status as a real estate investment trust and lead to 
its merger into its Wyndham International hotel chain. 
</P>
<P>
	The revamping, reported in The Dallas Morning News and The Wall  
Street Journal, will also include a $1 billion debt bailout by an 
investor group and the departure of chief executive officer Paul 
Nussbaum. Patriot American will change its name to Wyndham 
International Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Patriot was expected to announce today that investors led by  
Apollo Real Estate Advisors of New York will provide the company 
with $1 billion cash to pay down some of its bank debt, and that 
Chase Manhattan Bank and Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co. had committed $2.45 
billion to refinance the remainder of the debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The investors will receive an initial stake of between 29  
percent and 41 percent in Patriot, depending on how many 
shareholders participate in a planned $300 million rights offer. 
The group also will hold eight of Patriot's 19 board seats. The 
equity infusion and dropping of REIT status are subject to 
shareholder approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Patriot faces an estimated $1.3 billion in debt repayments this  
year and owes an additional $313 million in stock for equity 
advances. To make the debt payments, the company would have had to 
sell properties or file for federal bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
	The company found itself short of cash following acquisitions  
including last year's purchase of Wyndham. 
</P>
<P>
	Nussbaum told employees late Friday he was giving up his  
chairmanship, turning over operations of the Dallas-based company 
to president James D. Carreker, chairman and CEO of Patriot's 
Wyndham International hotel operation. Until now, Wyndham and 
Patriot have been paired companies with common ownership but 
different boards. Under the reorganization, Patriot will be merged 
into Wyndham. 
</P>
<P>
	Nussbaum will remain on the company's board of directors and  
serve Patriot as a consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	By dropping its REIT status, Patriot no longer will be required  
to pay out most of its net income to shareholders in the form of 
dividends, saving about $125 million annually before taxes. Patriot 
also will be able to sell properties without cumbersome REIT 
restrictions, although it will begin paying federal income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Nussbaum founded the company in 1995 as a small hotel investor  
with $300 million in properties, mostly in the Southwest. It's now 
one of the country's largest hotel companies with $7.5 billion in 
operations across several continents. The company operates hotels 
under name including Wyndham, Summerfield Suites, Carefree Resorts 
and Grand Heritage Hotels.

<HEADLINE>  Ogea Happy With Trade to Phillies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) -- Instead of nightly sellouts at Jacobs  
Field and yearly playoff trips, Chad Ogea now has to look forward 
to lonely summer days at half-empty Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Ogea is more than happy that the Cleveland Indians traded  
him to Philadelphia. The pitcher who beat Kevin Brown twice in the 
1997 World Series on Monday accused his former team of misusing him 
and causing some of the injury problems that have hindered his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what hurt me in Cleveland was that I went back and  
forth to the bullpen so much that it did affect my health in a 
way,'' said Ogea, traded to the Phillies for reliever Jerry 
Spradlin. ``It's tough on your arm when you sit around for 10, 11, 
12 days and then pitch six innings and come back two days later and 
throw again. That does affect your arm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the Phillies, Ogea will get a chance to be the No. 2  
starter behind Curt Schilling. After the trade in November, manager 
Terry Francona called Ogea and promised that he won't be yanked 
from the rotation if he struggles. 
</P>
<P>
	``He reassured me that we don't do that here,'' Ogea said. ``If  
you pitch bad, you're going to go back out there again. It allows 
you to do your job. It allows you to go out and pitch without 
having to worry, `What's going to happen if I pitch bad? I can't 
make a mistake here because if I pitch bad, I'm gone.' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's just the way it was done in Cleveland,'' he said. ``It  
wasn't just me, it was a lot of guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fairness to the Indians, who have played in two of the last  
four World Series, Ogea was never healthy enough to stay in the 
rotation for a full season in his five years in Cleveland. He's had 
numerous knee surgeries -- to the point where he hardly has any 
cartilage left -- and went on the disabled list three times last 
year with a knee problem, a strained pectoral muscle and tendinitis 
in his pitching hand. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians, who fired pitching coach Mark Wiley and replaced  
him with Phil Regan after last season, did not want to address 
Ogea's comments, spokesman Bart Swain said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ogea is signed for this season at $1.8 million with a club  
option for 2000. If he can stay healthy and adjust to the National 
League, he will be a steal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Phillies already are taking precautions with the 28-year-old  
right-hander. Instead of participating in baserunning drills with 
the rest of the pitchers, Ogea stands on the side and watches. He 
does his cardiovascular work on an exercise bike. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not really concerned about it, because I think here I  
won't have to worry about (injuries) as much,'' Ogea said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Ogea has yet to spend a full season in the majors,  
Francona views him as a playoff-tested veteran. Compared with many 
of his new teammates, he is. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been through the wars, he's been to the playoffs,''  
Francona said. ``I'd say we're counting on him to be a veteran 
pitcher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ogea, opposed by Brown in Games 2 and 6 of the 1997 World Series  
against Florida, won both games to keep Cleveland alive. With the 
Indians facing elimination in Game 6, Ogea was 2-for-3 with a 
double, a run and two RBIs off Brown -- perhaps the most 
intimidating right-hander in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Allowing only two runs in the two starts, Ogea became the first  
Cleveland pitcher to win twice in the Series since Hall of Famer 
Bob Lemon in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
	Ogea understands it may be a while before he gets back to the  
World Series -- if ever. And he's OK with that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look at the organization here and the way they're building  
things, and we've got a real good chance to be a contender here,'' 
Ogea said. ``It may not happen right away, but we've got a new 
stadium coming and the way they're running things, it looks like 
the team is going to stay together for a long time. That's how you 
win year in and year out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On that note, Ogea couldn't resist one more shot at his former  
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a team like Cleveland where you look at how many guys  
are left from '95. It's not a whole lot,'' he said. ``Cleveland 
wins year in and year out, but the division's not that strong. If 
they were in the Eastern division with the Yankees, they'd have no 
chance.''

<HEADLINE> Wheat Futures Rise Sharply / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat futures rose sharply Monday on the Chicago  
Board of Trade as unexpected export business boosted prices out of 
the doldrums. Corn and soybeans also finished mostly higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat advanced on news Egypt, the largest buyer of U.S. wheat,  
had purchased 350,000 metric tons of wheat over the weekend. The 
sale buoyed a market that had been on the retreat for more than a 
week and spurred ideas prices at their lowest in more than two 
decades had finally stimulated demand and shifted the balance of 
sales away from foreign competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, Pakistan this week is seeking to buy 300,000 metric  
tons of wheat from either the United States, Australia or Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans also rebounded from two weeks of heavy losses after the  
U.S. Agriculture Department reported inspections of potential 
exports jumped 14 percent last week to 22.2 million bushels from 
19.5 million bushels a week earlier. The gains, however, were 
expected to be limited since South American farmers this month 
begin harvesting what is expected to be bumper competing crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn rose as export inspections jumped to 41 million bushels  
from 30.3 million bushels a week earlier. Wheat export inspections 
rose to 16.04 million bushels from 15.6 million bushels. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for May delivery rose 6 1/4 cents to $2.54 3/4 a bushel; May  
corn rose 1 cent to $2.11 1/4 a bushel; May oats were unchanged at 
$1.06 1/4 a bushel; May soybeans rose 5 cents to $4.63 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef and lean hog futures finished mixed on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange, while pork bellies retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle rose .23 cent to 68.25 cents a pound; March  
feeder cattle fell .22 cent to 73.95 cents a pound; April lean hogs 
rose .47 cent to 43.47 cents a pound; March pork bellies fell .43 
cent to 49.07 cents a pound.

<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Richard Hamilton of Connecticut and Tim  
James of Miami were the only unanimous selections to the all-Big 
East first team Monday and both were repeat choices from last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, the conference player of the year last season as a  
sophomore, was second in the league in scoring this season at 21.3

<HEADLINE> Injured Violinist Awarded $30M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A jury on Monday awarded $30 million to a  
prize-winning violinist who lost a leg and part of her foot when 
she was dragged down a train platform after her violin case got 
caught behind a door. 
</P>
<P>
	The award was far less than the $66 million in compensatory  
damages and about $500 million in punitive damages Rachel Barton 
had sought. Railroad attorneys told jurors $5 million total was a 
fair amount. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton was dragged 366 feet down the tracks from a commuter  
train platform in suburban Winnetka in January 1995. She sued 
Metra, the suburban commuter rail agency, and the Chicago and 
Northwestern Transportation Co., now owned by Union Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rachel Barton was able to stand up to two railroads with  
enormous resources and ask a jury of her peers to recognize the 
depth of her injuries,'' said her lawyer, Robert Clifford. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors were asked to decide whether the railroads' negligence or  
Barton's failure to try to free herself when her $500,000 violin 
was caught behind a train door led to the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	In the verdict, the jury placed 4.5 percent of the blame with  
Barton and the rest with the railroads. 
</P>
<P>
	Railroad attorneys suggested Barton shared the blame for the  
accident because she was too worried about her expensive violin to 
try to slip out of its strap. 
</P>
<P>
	Railroad lawyer C. Barry Montgomery said the results proved the  
justice system is flawed. 
</P>
<P>
	``People relate to the Michael Jordans of the world and the  
enormous amounts being spent in the movie industry, and when that 
carries over into the jury box that is a serious thing,'' 
Montgomery said. 
</P>
<P>
	In testimony, Barton, 24, described her life since the accident  
as painful and trying. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just one big Frankenstein monster,'' she said on the  
witness stand, describing scars on her legs and one that runs the 
length of her stomach. 
</P>
<P>
	Before she was injured, Barton in 1992 became the first American  
and youngest person ever to win first prize in the Bach Competition 
in Leipzig, Germany.

<HEADLINE> Air Bag Said To Cause Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- A crash test showed the passenger air bag in a  
1997 Dodge Caravan minivan posed a high likelihood of serious or 
fatal neck injury, according to a study by the National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal agency said Monday that it plans to conduct further  
research to evaluate the air bag system on older Chrysler minivans 
and will release its findings in the summer. Chrysler used the 
front passenger air bag at issue in its 1993-97 model-year 
minivans. 
</P>
<P>
	Subsequent Dodge, Plymouth and Chrysler minivans were equipped  
with less-forceful second-generation air bags that the government 
allowed automakers to install after evidence showed children and 
small adults were at risk of possible injury from first-generation 
air bags in otherwise nonfatal crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	The unexpected finding came during a test in which a '97 Caravan  
was crashed at an angle into the front end of a '97 Honda Accord 
sedan at 35 mph. The air bag deployed normally. The passenger dummy 
simulated an adult female and was belted. The agency said the air 
bag put unusually high force on the dummy's neck. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler AG said the company had not yet seen the test  
data. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're taking NHTSA's concerns very seriously and we share  
those concerns,'' spokeswoman Sheila Gruber McLean said. ``This is 
an unusual test that has never been done before and we want to 
fully understand the results, but in order to do that we must have 
the data.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The test was conducted in July and the results were released  
Monday at the Society of Automotive Engineers convention in 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pretty outraged that NHTSA would wait almost eight  
months to release these results,'' McLean said. ``We have strived 
to cooperate with NHTSA on these issues in the past and we will 
continue to do so.''

<HEADLINE> Life in Prison in Subway Bomb Plot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A Palestinian who plotted to bomb a busy New  
York subway train in order to ``burn the Jews'' and free imprisoned 
Arab militants was sentenced Monday to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Gazi Ibrahim Abu Mezer, 25, was convicted last year in the 1997  
suicide-bomb plot. 
</P>
<P>
	Reading from a rambling statement in federal court in Brooklyn,  
Mezer called himself a victim of Israeli and U.S. oppression. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said Hitler killed 6 million, but that's a lie,'' he  
said. ``If there is justice in the world, the Israeli leaders 
should be tried as war criminals for genocide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Reena Raggi said the statement demonstrated  
Mezer is still a threat. ``It is always sad to see a human being, a 
young man, so consumed with hatred,'' Raggi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mezer testified at his trial that he wanted to ``martyr''  
himself and kill ``as many Jews as I could take.'' According to the 
FBI, Mezer plotted to bomb the B train because it serves a 
predominantly Jewish neighborhood in the Borough Park section of 
Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan was thwarted when a police SWAT team raided his seedy  
apartment just hours before the intended blast, wounding him and a 
companion, Lafi Khalil, 24, in a shootout. 
</P>
<P>
	The police, tipped off by a third roommate, found a nail-filled  
pipe bomb rigged to explode, an unfinished bomb and a letter 
protesting U.S. support for Israel and demanding freedom for Arab 
terrorists held in American and Israeli prisons. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter promised to ``burn the Jews'' if the demands were not  
met. 
</P>
<P>
	Last December, Khalil was given a three-year prison sentence and  
ordered deported.

<HEADLINE> Thirteen IOC Members Await Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The fate of at least 13 IOC members under  
investigation in the Salt Lake City scandal should be announced by 
the end of the week, the committee's chief investigator said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Pound said his five-member commission was trying to reach a  
consensus on all of the cases and was now dealing with an 
additional six IOC members linked to the scandal by a Utah ethics 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	One commission member, Jacques Rogge of Belgium, said earlier  
Monday that recommendations had been sent to IOC president Juan 
Antonio Samaranch after the panel's weekend hearings in Lausanne 
Switzerland, but Pound said the inquiry had not progressed that 
far. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope to have our position on each of these members made  
clear and public by the end of the week,'' Pound said. 
``Recommendations still have to be made. We have talked about these 
and are trying to reach a consensus. We're going to spend much of 
the next two days on this on a pretty concentrated basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission has been considering the cases of 13 members,  
including three who remained under investigation when the initial 
part of the inquiry concluded in January with nine members expelled 
or resigning. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Pound said, another half-dozen members have been identified  
by the Salt Lake ethics commission. The panel had included the 
names in working papers regarding unspecified payments, Pound said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll ask them what it's all about,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Rogge said twice during a separate interview that the  
commission's recommendations had been sent to Samaranch. Rogge also 
said he had left the commission meeting about an hour early Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel can recommend that members be expelled, exonerated or  
warned. If accepted by the executive board, the proposals will go 
to the full International Olympic Committee at a special general 
assembly March 17-18. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said he still hoped to have the commission's work finished  
by that meeting. He said the executive board review could be done 
by conference call to save time. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound's commission is among a half dozen that have been  
investigating cash payments, scholarships, free medical care and 
other inducements to IOC members stemming from Salt Lake's 
successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Some officials said the board needs to act swiftly to exonerate  
any members found innocent of wrongdoing and to give those facing 
expulsion time to prepare their defense for the session. 
</P>
<P>
	Three members testified before the Pound commission in Lausanne  
-- Phil Coles of Australia, Ashwini Kumar of India and Agustin 
Arroyo of Ecuador. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, one of the most influential sports officials involved in  
the 2000 Sydney Olympics, was with the commission for about one 
hour but refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Australian was linked to lavish travel and vacations  
allegedly paid for by Salt Lake City bidders. He has threatened 
legal action to clear his name. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound acknowledged he had dinner Sunday night in Switzerland  
with Coles and Michael Payne, the IOC's marketing director. He said 
he saw nothing wrong with sharing a meal with a friend and 
colleague of almost 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a very nice dinner, but we didn't talk about this,''  
Pound said. ``I see absolutely nothing wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Australia, IOC executive board member Kevan Gosper said he  
was surprised at the extent of the accusations against Coles but 
did not think he would face expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper did, however, call on Coles to explain his actions to the  
Australian public. 
</P>
<P>
	``Phil will have to address the criticisms being aimed at him in  
Australia,'' Gosper said.

<HEADLINE> Todd Helton To Sign With Rockies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Todd Helton will enter his second major  
league season in style. 
</P>
<P>
	Helton, the runner-up in last year's NL rookie of the year  
voting, will sign a four-year, $12 million contract with the 
Colorado Rockies on Tuesday. Sources said Helton will make $750,000 
in 1999, $1.3 million in 2000, $4.95 million in 2001 and $5 million 
in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited,'' Helton said Monday. ``I'm just happy it's over  
with, so I don't have to talk about it. I'm very happy with what 
the Rockies did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies could have re-signed Helton to a one-year deal for  
1999 but approached him before spring training about a possible 
multi-year contract that would take him through his first two years 
of arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	A deal was close Sunday, but Helton's agent Mike Moye and the  
Rockies talked by telephone Monday to finalize details of the 
yearly breakdown. The contract also includes a limited no-trade 
clause. 
</P>
<P>
	Helton's deal is the one of the largest guaranteed contracts  
ever given to a second-year player. Philadelphia's Scott Rolen 
signed a four-year, $10 million contract before the 1998 season. 
Boston's Nomar Garciaparra's $23.25 million, five-year deal signed 
before last season is the richest contract for a second-year 
player. 
</P>
<P>
	``It secures my financial security, plus I'll be 29 at that  
time, hopefully just starting to figure some things out,'' Helton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Helton adapted well last year as he replaced popular first  
baseman Andres Galarraga. He started the year slowly, but regrouped 
to finish the season hitting .315 with 25 homers and 97 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	In the closest rookie of the year voting in 16 years, Helton  
finished nine points behind Chicago Cubs pitcher Kerry Wood. 
</P>
<P>
 *NOTES:* The Rockies added right-handed pitcher Mike Saipe to their 
list of non-roster invitees. Saipe, 25, will join the team Tuesday, 
giving Colorado some added pitching depth when they begin playing 
the first of 33 exhibition games on Thursday.

	Thousands Take Cover in Israel  
</P>
<P>
	KIRYAT SHMONA, Israel (AP) -- Thousands of civilians in Israel  
and Lebanon are taking cover today after Israel yesterday launched 
its largest set of airstrikes in years against Hezbollah in 
response for attacks that killed seven Israelis in southern Lebanon 
in the past week. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told 
his cabinet that the army will ``continue to fight'' against the 
Iranian-backed guerrillas, but didn't say if more attacks will 
follow. The airstrikes renewed the debate in Israel over how to end 
the 17-year occupation of southern Lebanon.

	U.N. Land-Mine Treaty Takes Effect

	GENEVA (AP) -- An international treaty banning land mines goes  
into effect today, but the United States isn't among the 133 
countries that have signed on. President Clinton says the United 
States needs to keep using mines along the tense border between 
North and South Korea, but he has set the year 2006 as a target for 
joining the other countries. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan says 
that even with over a hundred countries signing the accord, the 
real mission now is to implement it. Just today, reports from 
Rwanda say two children died in a mine explosion.

Obasanjo captured 63 percent of the vote, election officials said. 
But aides to former Finance Minister Olu Falae, Obasanjo's 
opponent, said Falae would contest the results. Falae believes the 
election was rigged. International observers have pointed out 
ballot-box stuffing among other voting problems.

	Albright Hits Dissident Crackdown

	BEIJING (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright says the  
Clinton administration is dubious about China's crackdown on 
dissidents, but that it will not punish Beijing by holding up 
negotiations on China joining the World Trade Organization. 
Albright said linking trade with human right issues is ``not a good 
idea,'' but said the United States is ``deeply disturbed'' by the 
arrests of political opponents. Chinese officials blamed criticism 
of the country's human rights record on ``a handful of anti-China 
elements'' in the United States.

Americans can expect some power problems and ``manageable'' 
disruptions. Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah and Sen. Christopher Dodd, 
D-Conn., plan to issue a report on possible ramifications from the 
Y2K bug. At issue is what will happen on Jan. 1, 2000, when older 
computer systems misread the year 2000 as 1900. A draft of the 
report concludes that aviation airways will be safe, nuclear 
weapons will stay in their silos and most power grids will work.

	White House To Attack Counsel Law  
</P>

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reversing the Clinton administration's  
long-standing position, Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder plans 
to tell Congress Tuesday the independent counsel law is 
fundamentally flawed and should be allowed to expire in June, a 
senior administration official said Monday night. In rare cases in 
which there is a genuine conflict of interest, the attorney general 
could use her long-standing statutory authority to hire a special 
counsel to conduct an investigation, Holder will say, a senior 
official said. Holder will cite the use of special counsels 
appointed by the attorney general in several scandals, including 
Teapot Dome and Watergate, as serving the country well.

atmosphere and an end to the crackdown,'' Albright said Tuesday at 
a news conference ending her three-day visit to China. ``There has 
to be a release of people.'' Albright didn't win any concessions on 
the human rights issue, however, in her meetings with Chinese 
leaders. Instead, the Chinese said it was an internal affair and 
they complained about a State Department report that condemned the 
crackdown on leaders of a banned democratic party.

	PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) -- Panama's president urged lawmakers  
Monday to pass legislation needed to operate the Panama Canal after 
the United States hands it over on Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Politicians must not become too involved in their own campaigns

Balladares said. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez Balladares, whose single five-year term ends Sept. 1, said  
he soon would present a budget for operation of the canal, which is 
to be managed by an independent agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States must withdraw from the canal zone under 1979  
treaties signed by former Presidents Carter and Omar Torrijos.

<HEADLINE>  George Mason Celebrates Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) -- It had been so long since George Mason cut  
down the nets after a victory that coach Jim Larranaga actually had 
his players practice it first. 
</P>
<P>
	Then they did it for real, earning only the second NCAA  
tournament bid in school history. 
</P>
<P>
	The big celebration came Sunday night, when the Patriots  
defeated Old Dominion 63-58 to win the Colonial Athletic 
Association tournament in Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
	By Monday, Larranga was a miracle worker-in-demand, soaking in a  
rare day of attention at a school that has barely registered a blip 
on the national basketball screen. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a long road,'' Larranaga said. ``But well worth the  
wait.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dress rehearsal had come a week earlier, when Mason beat  
American in the final regular-season game at home. It was an easy 
victory and the Patriots had already clinched the title, but 
Larranaga told his players to have some fun and cut down the nets 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did that because, quite frankly, over the last seven or  
eight years, the George Mason faithful really have not had a lot to 
celebrate,'' Larranaga said. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the game was over, I told the players there's no greater  
way to prepare ourselves for what it would be like to win the CAA 
tournament and celebrate than to practice it. And that's what we 
did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	George Mason was expected to make a splash in the 1990s, but  
under Paul Westhead, the former NBA coach who brought his 
fast-break game to Fairfax in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Westhead's teams never came close to a winning record  
and his players had off-the-court troubles. He was fired after four 
seasons and a 38-70 record. 
</P>
<P>
	Larranaga, who had 12 successful seasons at Bowling Green,  
arrived in 1997, put the emphasis on defense and went 9-18 his 
first year. This season, his Patriots are 19-10, one short of the 
school record for victories. 
</P>
<P>
	But it took a midseason savvy coaching move to pull it all  
together. It was Jan. 30. The Patriots had lost three of their 
previous four in the conference, marring a school-best 5-0 start. 
</P>
<P>
	So, in a big game at home against James Madison, Larranaga  
started five players who are usually subs -- the Green Team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our White Team had started to feel stressed,'' Larranaga said.  
``They were showing signs of frustration. I couldn't understand 
why, other than they wanted to win so badly it was difficult for 
them to relax and enjoy playing basketball and have fun. Our Green 
Team was practicing well, enjoying it, beating the White Team in 
practice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Green Team held its own, and the score was 10-8 when the  
starters entered the game. Mason went on to beat Madison and hasn't 
lost since. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a gamble,'' Larranaga said. ``But it certainly paid  
off, because the Green Team did a great job, and it helped the 
White Team to relax. After the game was over, it allowed me to go 
deep into my bench the rest of the season and use the Green Team as 
a unit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Patriots' winning streak is now 10. They are led by senior  
guard Jason Miskiri and 27-year-old sophomore forward George Evans, 
a Gulf War veteran and the CAA's player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Now it gets tougher. The previous George Mason team to make the  
NCAAs, Ernie Nestor's team 10 years ago, had to face Indiana and 
was gone after one round. 
</P>
<P>
	Larranaga's team won't get much more respect from the seeding  
committee. After all, Mason is 0-11 lifetime vs. the Atlantic Coast 
Conference, 1-9 vs. the Big East, 2-10 vs. the Atlantic 10. It also 
hurts that Evans played in the CAA final with a severe ankle sprain 
and will need plenty of rehab the next 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	But CAA teams have been known to pull the upset. Larranaga  
watched one himself 12 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, when I watched Richmond beat South Carolina in the  
first round of the NCAA tournament at the MCI Center, I said to 
myself, `I want that to be us next year.' ''

<HEADLINE> Pap Smear Urged For Some Girls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Suburban and rural white girls in New England had  
strikingly high rates of cervical cell abnormalities, which are 
often caused by a sexually transmitted virus and can lead to 
cancer, a study found. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings argue for early Pap-smear screening of all sexually  
active girls, not just those who live in inner cities and belong to 
minority groups, where such high rates have been found before, the 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, led by Dr. Sharon M. Mount of the University of  
Vermont, was published in the March issue of Pediatrics. 
</P>
<P>
	Past studies indicate human papillomavirus, or HPV, is the most  
common sexually transmitted virus in the United States, affecting 
13 percent to 46 percent of young women, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among U.S. adolescent girls, about one-third are sexually active  
by ninth grade and about two-thirds by 12th grade, putting them at 
high risk for catching HPV, which is well known to cause cervical 
cell changes that can lead to cancer, the researchers said. 
Abnormal cells revealed by Pap smears can be removed before they 
become malignant. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers reviewed 10,296 Pap smear diagnoses made over a  
one-year period for females ages 10 to 19 in suburban and rural 
Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont. Almost all were white and were 
patients at family planning clinics, private doctors' offices, 
student health clinics and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers found 3.8 percent of the Pap smears showed cell  
abnormalities of the type that might later develop into cancer, and 
14.6 percent of the smears bore evidence of infection. The smears 
did not reveal the proportion of infections caused by HPV. No 
cancers were found. 
</P>
<P>
	``This high rate of abnormal Pap smear results of both an  
infectious and precancerous nature in this population may reflect a 
high level of sexual activity among adolescent girls,'' the 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among 10- to 14-year-olds, seven cases of precancerous changes  
were found in a total of 378 Pap smears, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	An accompanying editorial by experts at Harvard Medical School  
praised the study for contributing valuable data about ``strikingly 
high'' rates of cell abnormalities in females that many might 
consider low-risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``A primarily white and rural or suburban population might be  
expected to have rates of abnormal Pap smears lower than a 
population of urban women of mixed race and ethnicity,'' the 
editorial said.

<HEADLINE> Adults Face Kids' Learning Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Cary Sandberg scored very high on standardized tests and was  
eighth in his high school class, so he knew he wasn't stupid. But 
mysteries about his mind still plagued him into adulthood: An 
inability to connect with friends. A string of unfulfilling jobs. A 
nagging forgetfulness. 
</P>
<P>
	Then last summer, Sandberg and his wife were having their  
5-year-old son tested for learning disabilities and ADD -- attention 
deficit disorder. And something about the questions struck a chord. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden I could see it. All these problems I had been  
having were exactly the kinds of things they were looking for,'' 
said Sandberg, 44. 
</P>
<P>
	That day was the start of an intense journey. After a battery of  
tests and visits to doctors, Sandberg was diagnosed as having ADD. 
He now takes the hyperactivity drug Ritalin and works with a 
behavioral psychologist on reorganizing the way he thinks about 
everything from his career to his memory. 
</P>
<P>
	``My days of locking my keys in the car are probably over,'' he  
says. 
</P>
<P>
	ADD and Ritalin are terms most commonly associated with kids and  
school difficulties. But a growing number of adults are also being 
diagnosed. Experts say interest is booming because of research and 
publicity generated by the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Groups such as the National Center for Learning Disabilities are  
putting out data on adults for the first time. The Journal of 
Learning Disabilities, a prominent periodical, did a special issue 
on adults last summer -- its first. 
</P>
<P>
	And since the mid-1990s the federal government has been tacking  
on a message to states along with education and welfare funding: 
Make adults with learning disabilities a priority. 
</P>
<P>
	``Folks realized that these weren't children's problems, that  
they persisted into adulthood,'' said Dr. Sally Scott, assistant 
director of the Learning Disabilities Center at the University of 
Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal employment hot lines report more inquiries about  
learning and attention problems. Private and government attorneys 
say more lawsuits are being filed by workers claiming 
discrimination because of a learning or attention deficit problem 
and adult students needing special concessions in exams and 
lectures. 
</P>
<P>
	The trend worries those who say attention deficit is  
overdiagnosed -- a quick medical fix that dulls an exuberant if 
unfocused mind -- and that learning disorders reflect lesser 
intelligence, not disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the things that pass for learning disabilities used to  
be called stupidity,'' said former Boston University president John 
Silber, who drew national attention in 1997 when he fought a 
lawsuit filed by learning-disabled students who alleged the school 
was discriminating by requiring them to study foreign languages. A 
judge let the requirement stand but fined BU $1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Lawrence Diller, a behavioral pediatrician in Walnut Creek,  
Calif., believes only about one-tenth of those diagnosed as having 
ADD are seriously impaired and unable to function without Ritalin. 
The rest, he says, are merely ``temperamentally diverse,'' and the 
question is whether society can handle that diversity. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the only way you can make it is by taking a performance  
enhancer, I question the values of that society,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ritalin is prescribed to millions of Americans -- mostly children  
-- for ADD. The drug is believed to calm people by boosting levels 
of the neurotransmitter serotonin, but its effects are poorly 
understood. There is no diagnostic test for ADD and no gold 
standard for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason children today are handled so differently is Public  
Law 94-142, a 1975 federal statute that totally overhauled the 
school system. It required that students be evaluated for learning 
and attention-deficit disabilities and that everyone get an equal 
education -- whatever accommodations that takes. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, advocates for the disabled say, adults often discover  
their own learning disabilities through their children -- as 
Sandberg did. And Glenn Young. 
</P>
<P>
	Young was 30 and hawking beer at the Seattle Kingdome when he  
and his wife took 4-year-old Sasha for private school admissions 
tests. At the time, Young was struggling to keep a secret: He could 
barely read or write. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `That's the part of tests I always do poorly on,' and  
`Oh, and that part too,' and the woman administering the test said, 
`It sounds like you have a learning disorder.' And then all the 
deep dark secrets I'd hidden from everyone, she knew 
instantaneously,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Young was diagnosed as having dyslexia and dysgraphia, brain  
dysfunctions that impair reading and writing. He worked for the 
next three years with a tutor, relearning to read and write, then 
went on to college and a graduate degree in public administration. 
He quit vending in 1995 and is now a disability and literacy 
specialist with the U.S. Department of Education in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people in my peer group had college degrees and were  
doctors and lawyers and were moving up the chain, and there I was, 
still vending,'' said Young, now 48. ``All along I thought I was 
stupid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another whose life was radically changed is Peter Homans, a  
47-year-old investment manager from Belmont, Mass. All his life 
Homans experienced sudden, random periods when he couldn't 
concentrate -- on exams in graduate school, on family issues, on 
jobs. He saw every word as he spoke, as if it were being typed on a 
typewriter. He couldn't distinguish one voice from another. 
</P>
<P>
	Diagnosed as having ADD six years ago, he began taking Ritalin.  
He explains the before-and-after difference: 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like someone who is ADD without treatment is going along  
on one of those old pump railroad things, they're pumping as hard 
as they can, and their hair is flying, their pants are falling off, 
their shirt is flapping in the wind,'' he said. ``With treatment, 
they're going faster but everything's tucked in.''

<HEADLINE> Met Chamber Ensemble a Rare Treat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In its quest to follow the example of the Vienna  
Philharmonic and extend its reach beyond the pit, the Metropolitan 
Opera Orchestra began giving symphonic concerts at Carnegie Hall in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, there's another new twist. In Weill Recital Hall, a  
256-seat jewel of a room in Carnegie's upper reaches, many of the 
orchestra's players appear as the Met Chamber Ensemble, giving 
listeners an up-close look at the musicians who produce that 
fabulous sound night after night at Lincoln Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's program featured 22 of the orchestra's 103 full members  
plus artistic director James Levine (at the piano) and sopranos 
Jennifer Welch and Alexandra Deshorties in a program of Mozart, 
Berg, Webern and Mendelssohn -- mainstream classical composers 
wrapped around two from the second Viennese school that Levine 
loves so much. 
</P>
<P>
	With three crystal chandeliers hanging above the audience, it  
was like a bit of old Europe, a perfect way to spend a rainy winter 
afternoon. But old Europe rarely had players of this caliber. 
</P>
<P>
	Mozart's Serenade in B-flat major for 13 instruments began the  
evening, and it was so soothing, so light and airy, that the 
audience seemed to drift off during the hourlong piece. 
</P>
<P>
	In a similar manner, the strings got to show off during the  
Mendelssohn Octet in E-flat major. Concertmaster Raymond Gniewek, 
co-principal cellist Rafael Figueroa and principal viloist Michael 
Ouzounian shined in a way they never do in the pit. (Gniewek has 
been the concertmaster since 1957 and Figueroa often is the player 
of those melting solos during ``Otello'' and ``Die Walkure.'') 
</P>
<P>
	These performers listen to each other with such detail and focus  
that it is hard to imagine eight musicians playing this more 
delicately. Levine stood applauding from his seat in the audience 
and an aisle, much like a proud parent during a student recital. 
</P>
<P>
	Berg's Four Pieces for Clarinet and Piano and the four Webern  
selections -- Six Songs, Five Canons, Three Traditional Rhymes and 
Three Songs -- were harder to judge. Both Miss Welch, who made her 
Met debut last fall as a bridesmaid in Mozart's ``The Marriage of 
Figaro,'' and Miss Deshorties, like Miss Welch a member of the Met 
young artist development program, offered involved performances, 
but the small hall made the sound seem harsh at times.

<HEADLINE>  Flames Trade Fleury to Avalanche </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- With the acquisition of Theoren Fleury, one of the  
NHL's best teams just got better -- even if it is only for the short 
term. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado Avalanche, three years removed from a Stanley Cup  
title, regained their status as a serious Stanley Cup contender on 
Sunday by trading with the Calgary Flames for the high-scoring 
Fleury. 
</P>
<P>
	``Theo Fleury will bring some additional scoring punch to our  
hockey club and much more,'' coach Bob Hartley said. ``For many 
years in this league, he has been a proven leader and a great 
playoff performer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury, an unrestricted free agent at the end of the season,  
went to the Avalanche with winger Chris Dingman. The Flames 
received forward Rene Corbet, defenseman Wade Belak and future 
considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury, a 30-year-old wing, has spent his entire NHL career with  
the Flames, winning a Stanley Cup with the team as a rookie in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
	He has 30 goals and 39 assists this season, ranking sixth in NHL  
scoring. He has said repeatedly he wouldn't sign a new contract 
until testing the free-agent market this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury's stance on free agency might explain why the Flames  
didn't get much in return. 
</P>
<P>
	While the trade immediately bolsters the Avalanche, it hurts the  
Flames (21-29-10) in the short run. They are only two points behind 
Edmonton for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western 
Conference, but now have lost their only true star. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was an amazing opportunity that we couldn't let go by,''  
said Colorado general manager Pierre Lacroix. 
</P>
<P>
	Flames GM Al Coates agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Colorado Avalanche are a much better team today,'' he  
said. ``Theo's a great player. We're going to miss him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury, who flew into Denver on Sunday night and was met by an  
impromptu welcoming party of media, fans and curious passengers at 
Denver International Airport, said he was ``shocked'' when he was 
informed of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was tough, really tough'' to leave Calgary, he said. ``But  
I tell you, I was thrilled it was Colorado. They've got a great 
team. I think this is a great opportunity and a great situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he expected to be a rent-a-player for the playoffs or  
planned to be with Colorado beyond this season, he said, ``We'll 
see how it works out. My No. 1 focus is just hockey right now. The 
only reason why I'm here is to help this team win a Stanley Cup, 
and that's my intention. I don't think we need that distraction of 
me talking about my contract every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It isn't likely, however, that Colorado will be able to reach  
agreement with Fleury and also re-sign Peter Forsberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacroix said he wasn't deterred by Fleury's contract status.  
</P>
<P>
	``We made this transaction purely on a hockey basis,'' he said.  
``The next few months will give us a chance to talk contract with 
Theo and his agent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche lead the NHL's Northwest Division with a 30-22-8  
record but have been inconsistent. They began the year with a 1-5-1 
record, then later ran off a 12-game winning streak that was 
followed immediately by an 0-3-4 stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	With Fleury's acquisition, Lacroix said, ``I think we have the  
potential to reach the ultimate this season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury became the Flames' career scoring leader last Friday. In  
791 games, he has 364 goals and 466 assists for 830 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Calgary's Cory Stillman said Fleury is ``by  
far our greatest player and he's proving it now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hartley said he hasn't decided which line Fleury will play on,  
but said the acquisition probably means the breakup of the 
Forsberg-Joe Sakic pairing that has worked well for much of this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll take some time to see who plays better with whom,''  
Hartley said. ``We have to give the players time to get adjusted to 
Theo and for him to get adjusted to us. 
</P>
<P>
	``We gave up two good players and a future prospect, but that's  
the price you pay in this business. It's a great move.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sakic said Fleury ``makes us that much better. I think what it  
really does is give us two solid lines. He's an exciting player who 
is great with the puck and is a sparkplug out there. Obviously, we 
feel that with this trade we have a great chance to win the Stanley 
Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Right wing Adam Deadmarsh called Fleury ``one of the best  
players in the league -- one of the top 15 players, I'd say, for 
sure. Who wouldn't want him on their team?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defenseman Adam Foote said Fleury ``gives us two huge lines now  
and just strengthens the whole team. He's an offensive threat, a 
natural goal scorer, and he's also going to bring leadership and 
experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dingman, an enforcer, has played only two games this season.  
</P>
<P>
	Corbet, 25, has eight goals and 14 assists in 53 games, but is  
currently sidelined with a strained hamstring. Belak, a 22-year-old 
prospect who was a No. 1 draft pick in 1994, had no points while 
appearing briefly in 22 games this season with the Avalanche. He 
currently is playing for Colorado's American Hockey League 
affiliate in Hershey, Pa.

<HEADLINE> Spring Training Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Sammy Sosa finally arrived at spring training Monday and -- in a  
surprise, so did Yogi Berra. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hall of Fame catcher, who had boycotted the New York Yankees  
since George Steinbrenner fired him 14 years ago, attended an 
intrasquad game in Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tremendous. It's a great feeling,'' said Steinbrenner,  
who wants Berra at the regular-season home opener against Detroit 
on April 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner apologized two months ago for firing Berra after a  
slow start in April 1985. Berra has not been back to the ballpark 
for a Yankees game since. 
</P>
<P>
	``He called, he wanted to apologize and he said the right thing.  
If he didn't, I wouldn't be here,'' Berra said. 
</P>
<P>
	He wouldn't commit to the home opener but made clear he's likely  
to appear. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll see what happens,'' Berra said, adding, ``Let's keep it  
a secret.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa reported to Cubs' camp in Mesa, Ariz., three days after the  
most of his teammates but a day ahead of the mandatory reporting 
date. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just feel happy,'' he said. ``Everybody is here waiting for  
me. I love it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark McGwire won the home run race 70-66, but Sosa helped the  
Chicago Cubs reach the playoffs by hitting .308 with 158 RBIs. Sosa 
spent a whirlwind offseason traveling the world, picking up awards, 
working for Dominican Republic hurricane relief and making public 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	He was in Japan, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, New York, Los Angeles,  
Arizona, Atlanta, Las Vegas and Washington, D.C., where he helped 
light the national Christmas tree and attended the State of the 
Union address. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, McGwire went on vacation to Australia and made  
almost no personal appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm satisfied because 66 is a lot of home runs and lot of  
people wanted to shake my hand,'' Sosa said. ``I've been meeting a 
lot of people I would have never dreamed about. The nicer you are 
to people, the more they want to be around you. I think I have 
earned that respect from everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another big home run hitter, Albert Belle, learned Monday he  
will hit cleanup for his new team, the Baltimore Orioles. Manager 
Ray Miller had been toying with the idea of batting Belle third, 
though the temperamental slugger stated his preference last week to 
remain a cleanup hitter . 
</P>
<P>
	``When we had our talk after he signed, he said, `What position  
do you want me to play?' And I said, `Third or fourth,' and he 
laughed,'' Miller said at Fort Lauderdale, Fla. ``He told me, `I'll 
play wherever you want and I'll hit wherever you want.' 
</P>
<P>
	``We also had a 30-minute or 40-minute conversation in my office  
about a week ago and the batting order never came up. I made the 
decision about the third day down here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other camp news:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The Boston Red Sox said they may be interested in signing ace  
pitcher Pedro Martinez's brother Ramon, who is recovering from 
shoulder surgery. ``He was pretty positive about maybe signing 
here,'' said Pedro, who spoke Saturday to Ramon, who was in the 
Dominican Republic. Boston general manager Dan Duquette said Monday 
he went to Santo Domingo two weeks ago to watch Ramon throw in his 
comeback from the operation that ended his 11th season with Los 
Angeles after just 15 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	-- McGwire won't make his spring debut until Saturday, when the  
Cardinals play in Jupiter, Fla., against Montreal. McGwire won't 
make the 90-minute bus trip to Vero Beach for St. Louis' spring 
opener against Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	-- At Clearwater, Fla., negotiations broke down between Bobby  
Abreu's agent and the Philadelphia Phillies, who don't expect to 
get their starting right fielder signed to a multiyear contract 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Once Jose Rijo's baseball academy in the Dominican Republic is  
complete, he intends to try to resurrect his baseball career one 
more time. Despite nearly four years of elbow operations and 
waylaid comeback attempts, Rijo isn't ready to retire. He said 
Monday that he hopes to sign another minor league contract with the 
Cincinnati Reds in a few weeks, once he's done supervising 
construction on the academy. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Todd Helton, the runner-up in last year's NL rookie of the  
year voting, will sign a four-year, $12 million contract with the 
Colorado Rockies on Tuesday. Sources said Helton will make $750,000 
in 1999, $1.3 million in 2000, $4.95 million in 2001 and $5 million 
in 2002.

<HEADLINE> Satellite Launcher Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOJAVE, Calif. (AP) -- The prototype of a manned rocket powered  
by kerosene and designed to land like a helicopter after carrying 
satellites into orbit has been unveiled by a company touting its 
money-saving potential. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rotary Rocket Co. of Redwood City says using kerosene in the  
Roton instead of hydrogen will cut launch costs by 90 percent. It 
is supposed to launch like a rocket, deploy a propeller and then 
land like a helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
	The prototype, dubbed Roton ATV, does not have launch engines.  
It will be used to test the rocket's landing system, which uses 
rotor blades with tip rockets to slow the vehicle down so it can 
land like a helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
	The rotor blades will deploy during re-entry, and thrusters will  
be fired 500 feet above the landing site. The thrusters are 
designed to speed up the blades and make Roton hover. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests of the landing system were to begin this month.  
</P>
<P>
	A completed Roton will blast into space, release a satellite  
into low-level orbit and return the same day by summer 2000, 
company President Gary Hudson said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The craft will be flown by two pilots, the first astronauts  
aboard a privately developed space vehicle.

<HEADLINE> Japan Official: Reforms Should Wait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan should hold off on cleaning up its strained  
public finances until it can sustain economic growth for several 
years, the finance minister said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, speaking at a regular press  
conference, said structural reforms and efforts to balance the 
budget should wait until after several years of 2 percent economic 
growth have been achieved. 
</P>
<P>
	Miyazawa's remarks echoed suggestions by the Economic Strategy  
Council, an advisory body to the prime minister, which last week 
issued a report saying Japan should regain a 2 percent annual 
growth rate by the end of fiscal 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	It said that the country should then take on structural reforms  
and try to balance the budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Miyazawa appeared less optimistic about the likelihood of  
immediate growth, however. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although there are some data suggesting a turnaround in the  
economy, I'm worried how sluggish machinery orders, a leading 
indicator of capital investment, will affect the overall economy,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mired in a deep banking crisis and slumping domestic demand,  
Japan is facing its worst recession since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's government is fighting to pull the  
nation out of the slump, having set aside $205 billion late last 
year to bail out troubled banks. 
</P>
<P>
	He added $38 billion to an economic stimulus package designed to  
jump-start growth with public works and tax breaks. And last month, 
Parliament approved a $681 billion budget for fiscal 1999 including 
massive spending hikes and tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	The measures have received mixed reviews, but a spokesman for  
the prime minister said Tuesday that the government has no 
immediate plans to introduce new ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``The need to take additional measures at this time has not been  
felt by the government leadership,'' said Akitaka Saiki, the prime 
minister's deputy press secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, statistics remain bleak.  
</P>
<P>
	The Management and Coordination agency released data today  
showing Japan's jobless rate remained at a record-high 4.4 percent 
in January for the third month in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of people seeking work after being forced out of  
their jobs rose by 340,000 in January from a year earlier to 1 
million -- the highest number since the government started compiling 
the data in the current form in 1984, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some say the end is in sight, however.  
</P>
<P>
	A national newspaper survey of presidents of top Japanese  
companies found most believe the economy will bottom out by the end 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighteen out of 30 presidents of top firms such as Sony Corp.,  
Cannon Inc. and Asahi Breweries believe the economy will begin its 
upswing by the end of this year, according to a survey published 
today in the Mainichi Shimbun.

<HEADLINE> Woman Bowler Nears $1 Million Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Aleta Sill has a chance this week to  
join that not-so-exclusive club of millionaire pro athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Big deal, you say?  
</P>
<P>
	Well, consider that Sill has spent 19 years trying to reach the  
mark, and her sport is women's bowling. 
</P>
<P>
	Should the 36-year-old from Dearborn, Mich., win the Greater  
Orlando Classic this week, she'll earn $11,500 and become the first 
female bowler to hit the million-dollar mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Sill says reaching the milestone is an accomplishment that  
``justifies her existence'' on one of the more obscure pro tours in 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't even imagine getting there,'' said Sill's traveling  
partner, Marianne DiRupo, an eight-year veteran who has earned a 
little more than one-quarter of what Sill has. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's exciting for Aleta, but it's discouraging in a way,  
too,'' DiRupo said. ``That someone can have (a record-tying) 30 
titles in a pro sport and barely be at $1 million. I was watching 
golf the other day. I don't even remember her name, but there was 
one girl who has one title and she's already a millionaire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $11,500 first prize is less than what the 14th-place  
finisher in last week's LPGA event earned. And it barely surpasses 
the 38th-place prize at last week's PGA Tuscon Open, an event that 
didn't include even one of the world's top 64 players because of 
the Match Play Championship, which gave out $1 million to its 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Sill knew what she was getting into when she decided  
to make a living rolling a bowling ball at age 17. 
</P>
<P>
	It is anything but glamorous.  
</P>
<P>
	Four times a year, she and DiRupo load up their motor home and  
travel to the next series of stops on the Professional Women's 
Bowling Association tour. There are 18 tournaments in all, divided 
into spring, summer, winter and fall sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	They park amid the other campers at the bowling alley, dine on  
fast food and junk from the vending machine. Between rounds they 
watch satellite TV, play with their dog and two cats, do chores 
around the home and practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, Sill has had a lot of extra time for practice. Mired  
in a slump for about six months, she missed the so-called cut for 
the second time in three events last week in Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm paid on my performance,'' she said. ``I didn't bowl well  
this week, so I didn't get a check. I got zero money. And that's 
hard. That can be hard mentally if you do this a couple times in a 
row.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sill concedes that she does enjoy some perks.  
</P>
<P>
	She has a sponsorship deal with a ball manufacturer that gives  
her enough money to eat, fill the 100-gallon tank in the motor home 
and pay some bills when the bowling gets tough. 
</P>
<P>
	But we're talking meal money, here, hardly anything to make a  
living on. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason for that is the lack of a good sponsorship deal. That  
stems from the absence of a good TV deal, which itself comes about 
because bowling has little appeal as a spectator sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who do want to keep up with this tour have to work hard at  
it. The final round of the average women's pro bowling tournament 
is televised five days after it takes place, at 4 p.m. on Tuesdays 
on ESPN2. 
</P>
<P>
	That, Sill says, is about as good as women's bowling can hope  
for these days. 
</P>
<P>
	``The outsiders see the glory on TV,'' DiRupo says, without even  
a hint of sarcasm in her voice. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it's a life they don't understand. They don't understand  
the balls you have to drill, the work you put into it. The prize 
funds may seem very nice, but winning 9, 10, $11,000 a purse, it's 
not a ton of money.''

<HEADLINE> Playful Sosa Joins Cubs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Well-traveled and bulked up, Sammy Sosa began  
a new season with his familiar smile. Clowning with teammates as 
fans lined the practice field, he was obviously pleased to be back. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no pressure, he said, to repeat his MVP season of a  
year ago when he and Mark McGwire recharged baseball with the 
greatest home run derby ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just feel happy,'' he said after reporting to spring  
training Monday. ``Everybody is here waiting for me. I love it. ... 
The race with Mark was great -- back and forth. We were motivation 
for each other. I just hope I can continue doing the job. I don't 
know if I can have another year like that, but you never know what 
will happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire won the home run race 70-66, but Sosa helped the Chicago  
Cubs reach the playoffs by hitting .308 with 158 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	If pitchers don't give him anything to hit this year, Sosa said  
he's prepared. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then I'll go to first, take a walk,'' he said. ``This is not  
1998. We don't need to go out and break records anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa was enjoying himself, cutting up with everyone from the  
time he walked into the clubhouse early Monday. But his first day 
was not pain free. 
</P>
<P>
	When a fan tossed a ball over a high fence for Sosa to  
autograph, it came as a surprise and plopped on the head of the 
normally sure-handed right fielder. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa sent six batting-practice homers over the fence at Fitch  
Park, but facing reliever Rod Beck, Sosa fouled a ball off his 
groin area and fell to the grass in pain. He shook it off and 
moments later was able to participate in a base-running drill. 
</P>
<P>
	``It got me pretty good,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	On a brilliant day with temperatures in the 80s, fans followed  
his every move, chanting his name. 
</P>
<P>
	``Seventy-six this year,'' one yelled.  
</P>
<P>
	Bats, shirts, programs and even an Arizona license plate ``Maris  
61'' were presented for Sosa to sign. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be more pressure on him because of what he did last  
year,'' teammate Gary Gaetti said. ``He can handle it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Sosa hit the field for the first time, he was greeted not  
only by the fans but by a battery of cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	``Welcome to my house,'' he said laughing as his teammates,  
gathered for stretching, began to applaud him. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Ed Lynch stood in the middle of one field and  
bowed to Sosa -- much as the right field bleacher bums at Wrigley 
Field do before every home game -- and Sosa raced across the 
manicured grass to shake his hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, you miss me, baby?'' a playful Sosa said, shaking hands  
with second baseman Mickey Morandini and shortstop Jeff Blauser in 
the clubhouse, shortly after his arrival. 
</P>
<P>
	He quickly hugged longtime equipment manager Yosh Kawano, who  
has been with the Cubs since 1943. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time I turned on the TV, you were there,'' coach Billy  
Williams told Sosa. ``You ready to do this again?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa spent a whirlwind offseason traveling the world, picking up  
awards, working for Dominican Republic hurricane relief and making 
public appearances. He was in Japan, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, New 
York, Los Angeles, Arizona, Atlanta, Las Vegas and Washington, 
where he helped light the national Christmas tree and attended the 
State of the Union address. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, McGwire went on vacation to Australia and made  
almost no personal appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm satisfied because 66 is a lot of home runs and lot of  
people wanted to shake my hand,'' Sosa said. ``I've been meeting a 
lot of people I would have never dreamed about. The nicer you are 
to people, the more they want to be around you. I think I have 
earned that respect from everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said a humanitarian award he won at the ESPYs meant as much  
to him as the MVP because it represented something other than his 
accomplishments on the field, 
</P>
<P>
	``I saved a lot of lives back home because of the help that came  
in,'' he said. ``I'm doing something great and will continue to do 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa's arrival Monday came three days after the team's first  
full-squad workout but still ahead of Tuesday's mandatory reporting 
date. He also reported three days later than most of his teammates 
last season and it certainly didn't hurt him. 
</P>
<P>
	He came to camp bigger than last season -- his muscular arms  
bulged and there was a little roll around his middle. He said he 
was up to 222 pounds which would be a 12-pound increase from what 
he was listed at last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all muscle, no fat,'' he said with a huge laugh. He said  
he wasn't tired from his offseason travel, just ready to play. His 
longest stretch at home since the season ended was about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been busy. But I'm only 30 years old and I don't get  
tired,'' he said. ``To get tired is mental, and I'm strong 
mentally.''

<HEADLINE> Wheat Jumps on Egypt Buy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Wheat futures rose sharply Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade  
as unexpected export business boosted prices out of the doldrums. 
Soybeans also finished higher for the first time in nearly two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, sugar futures fell sharply, while orange juice  
gained. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat advanced on news Egypt, the largest buyer of U.S. wheat,  
had purchased 350,000 metric tons of wheat over the weekend. The 
sale buoyed a market that had been on the retreat for more than a 
week and spurred ideas prices at their lowest in more than two 
decades had finally stimulated demand and shifted the balance of 
sales away from foreign competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat exports were down by nearly a third over last year before  
Monday's gains. Futures prices also were buoyed by new Pakistan 
this week is seeking to buy 300,000 metric tons of wheat from 
either the United States, Australia or Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans also rebounded from two weeks of heavy losses on the  
Chicago Board of Trade after the U.S. Agriculture Department 
reported inspections of potential exports jumped 14 percent last 
week to 22.2 million bushels from 19.5 million bushels a week 
earlier. The gains, however, were expected to be limited since 
South American farmers this month begin harvesting what is expected 
to be bumper competing crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for May delivery rose 6 1/4 cents to $2.54 3/4 a bushel; May  
soybeans rose 5 cents to $4.63 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar futures tumbled 4 percent, to a fresh 11 1/2-year low on the  
Board of Trade of the City of New York as heavy exports from Brazil 
were met with few takers on the world market. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's apparent worsening financial situation has led to  
greater exports from the world's largest grower, worsening a global 
supply glut. 
</P>
<P>
	While world consumption has increased steadily over the past few  
years, it has been outpaced by record harvests in several key 
producing countries. The situation has been made worse this year by 
fewer imports from Russia, the largest importing nation, and new 
import duties from protectionist India. That nation is the world's 
second-largest grower behind Brazil and is trying to protect its 
domestic farmers from weak prices. 
</P>
<P>
	May raw sugar fell 0.24 cent to 6.02 cents a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Frozen, concentrated orange juice futures were boosted on the  
New York Board of Trade as unseasonable temperatures swept through 
Florida growing regions last week, raising concerns about possible 
damage to crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures in Florida, which accounts for about 90 percent of  
the U.S. orange crop, averaged 5 degrees to 7 degrees below normal 
last week, agronomists reported, with frost being reported one 
night in west-central Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Orange juice rose 2.30 cents to 83.25 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Duke Tops AP Men's Hoops Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Duke, which made school and conference history last weekend, was  
No. 1 in The Associated Press college basketball poll for the 
fourth straight week Monday, while No. 2 Michigan State reached its 
highest ranking in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils (29-1) capped the first 16-0 season in Atlantic  
Coast Conference history on Saturday with an 81-61 victory over 
North Carolina, extending their winning streak to a school-record 
24 games. For the second straight week Duke received all but one of 
the first-place votes from a national media panel, getting 71 and 
1,799 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State (26-4) again got the other No. 1 vote and had  
1,694 points to move from third to second, its highest ranking 
since being No. 1 for two weeks during the 1978-79 season. The 
Spartans, led by sophomore Magic Johnson, won their only national 
championship that season. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut moved up one place to third and Auburn, which lost  
at Arkansas last week, dropped two places to fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland and Stanford remained fifth and sixth and were followed  
by Cincinnati, Utah, Miami and St. John's. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah, which was 12th last week, is back in the top 10 for the  
first time since the first poll of the regular season. The return 
trip to the top 10 was a little longer for Miami, which was last 
there in the final poll of the 1959-60 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State dropped one spot to No. 11 and was followed by UCLA,  
Arizona, Kentucky, North Carolina, College of Charleston, Indiana, 
Tennessee, Wisconsin and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The last five teams were Florida, Arkansas, Minnesota, Missouri  
and New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	The next-to-last poll of the season had a sizable shakeup as 14  
ranked teams lost at least one game last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Four teams reentered the Top 25 this week -- Tennessee, Arkansas,  
Minnesota and Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee (20-7) came back in at No. 18 and on a six-game  
winning streak, the last of which was over Kentucky on Sunday. The 
Volunteers were ninth in the preseason poll but were gone by the 
fifth week of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas (20-9) returned at No. 22 after a three-week absence.  
The Razorbacks lost at Alabama on Saturday but had beaten Auburn 
and Kentucky in their previous two games. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota (17-9) was out of the Top 25 the last two weeks and  
returned at No. 23 having won three of four. Missouri (20-7) is 
ranked for the third time in the last five weeks, this time coming 
in off a road victory at Texas on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the four teams that fell out of the rankings had been in  
the Top 25 all season. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue (19-10), which had been as high as eighth this season,  
dropped out from 23rd following losses to Minnesota and Michigan 
State. Syracuse (19-10), which had been as high as No. 12, dropped 
out from 24th following Sunday's loss to Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	Temple (19-9), which was tied for 24th last week, fell out after  
one week back in the poll after losing to Massachusetts on Sunday. 
Texas (18-11) made its first poll appearance of the season last 
week at No. 22, but was gone after the loss to Missouri.

	TOKYO (AP) -- Oji Paper Co., Japan's largest manufacturer of  
paper, said Tuesday that it plans to cut 2,000 jobs over the next 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Oji announced the cuts because of forecasts that it will suffer  
a net loss of $80 million in the current fiscal year, mainly 
because of costs related to investment portfolio losses at an 
overseas affiliate and sluggish sales.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed generally mixed  
Monday, with prices slumping in Tokyo but rising in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 145.79  
points, or 1.01 percent, closing at 14,221.75 points. On Friday, 
the index lost 102.91 points, or 0.71 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices fell on selling of blue chips in the wake of the  
dollar's weakness against the Japanese yen. Also making investors 
bearish were continued worries about the sale of corporate 
shareholdings ahead of the end of the fiscal year, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	A higher yen reduces the value of repatriated earnings by  
Japanese companies in dollar-denominated terms into yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 119.12 yen in late afternoon trading, down  
1.20 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also below its New York 
level of 119.17 yen late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Malaysian shares also closed sharply lower on jitters ahead of  
the impending release of corporate results. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's key Composite Index fell 2  
percent, or 10.69 points, to close at 531.54. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices in Hong Kong closed sharply higher for the second  
consecutive session, pushed up by persistent rumors that Walt 
Disney Co. may build a theme park in the territory. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, rose 161.97 points, or 1.6 percent, closing at 
10,020.46. On Friday, the index had surged 200.42 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said share prices rose on continued speculation that  
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang may announce plans for a Disney 
theme park in Hong Kong when he unveils his budget in the 
legislature on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hong Kong government has refused to comment on the  
speculation, which pushed up property prices in the past two 
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: The main index rose following the release of the  
island's fiscal budget for the year starting April 1. The Straits 
Times Index rose 10.94 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,422.85. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower for the first time in four  
sessions as investors sold financial stocks on news that the 
government will sell off some shares in state-run banks. The 
market's key Weighted Stock Price Index fell 6.27 points, or 0.1 
percent, to 6,312.25. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower, with brokers  
attributing the fall to a drop in the share price of market 
heavyweight Telecom of New Zealand Ltd. on going ex-dividend. The 
benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 32.84 points, or 1.4 percent, 
to 2,166.04. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed marginally lower on  
profit-taking. The Philippine Stock Exchange index of 30 selected 
companies slipped 0.78 point to 1,964.27. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: The Australian stock market closed higher, underpinned  
by gains in the banking and finance sector. The All Ordinaries 
Index rose 31.2 points, or 1.1 percent, to 2,911.1. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Share prices closed mixed, but speculative buying in  
selected blue chip stocks pushed up the key index. The Composite 
Index edged up 0.236 point, or 0.06 percent, to 396.325.

<HEADLINE> Albright Hits Dissident Crackdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright clashed  
with Chinese leaders today on China's crackdown on dissidents. But 
she said the Clinton administration will not punish Beijing by 
holding up negotiations on China joining the World Trade 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``We determined some time ago that it was not a good idea to  
link human rights and trade and that we actually make better 
progress with both when they are not linked,'' Albright said at a 
joint news conference with Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan. 
</P>
<P>
	In her meetings with Tang and Premier Zhu Rongji, the two sides  
disagreed on China stifling political dissent and opposition 
parties, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said. Albright 
argued for a universal to express different views. 
</P>
<P>
	``The discussions were forceful, tough and there wasn't a lot of  
agreement,'' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright ``made clear that the crackdowns, the arrests ... have  
caused substantial and intense reaction in the United States and 
that she is deeply disturbed by these detentions, trials, 
punishment for these peaceful political activities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tang blamed criticism of China's human rights record on ``a  
handful of anti-China elements'' in the United States. He warned 
that confronting Beijing on the matter is considered an intrusion 
into the country's internal affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Tang also suggested China would be unhappy if the administration  
sponsored a resolution condemning China's human rights record at a 
meeting of the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva this spring. 
No U.S. decision has been made. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have always been opposed to politicizing the human rights  
question,'' Tang said, smiling politely. ``Practice has proved that 
confrontation cannot solve the problem. And, secondly, to backtrack 
in this regard will have no future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright, standing beside Tang at the Diaoyutai State  
Guesthouse, did not address Tang's ``anti-China elements'' remark. 
</P>
<P>
	But in their meeting, Albright told him ``this was a bipartisan  
concern'' of the administration and Congress, Rubin said. ``She did 
not accept the idea that there was somehow some big conspiracy in 
the United States against China.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crackdown, focusing on Chinese trying to form an opposition  
democratic political party, has resulted in stiff sentences of 11 
to 13 years for its leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Just ahead of Albright's visit, Chinese police detained one  
activist, warned several others not to leave their homes and 
sentenced another to 1 1/2 years in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese dissidents canceled a meeting on human rights set to  
begin today because organizers were in detention and police 
prevented others from attending, said Zha Jianguo, a member of the 
banned China Democracy Party in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	On another contentious issue, Chinese officials strongly  
objected to U.S. plans to develop a theater missile defense system, 
which Taiwan wants to use as protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright told the Chinese leaders the United States has not made  
a decision on deployment and that such a system is defensive, Rubin 
said. The secretary also urged the Chinese to help prevent North 
Korea from developing missiles that are driving the missile 
protection effort. 
</P>
<P>
	A new Pentagon report estimates that by 2005 Beijing may be able  
to launch effective air and missile strikes against Taiwan, which 
it considers a renegade province. 
</P>
<P>
	China has more than 100 ballistic missiles pointed at Taiwan and  
has never renounced the use of force to regain the island, although 
the Pentagon did not predict a Chinese attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright also discussed with Zhu the possibility of reaching a  
WTO agreement with China in time for the premier's visit to 
Washington in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said ``there was good intent and good will expressed on  
both sides,'' but that detailed WTO negotiations still ``have a 
long way to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joining the WTO would give China low-tariff access to export  
markets and protect it from sanctions. The United States wants 
Beijing first to lower more of its tariffs on goods and get rid of 
other trade barriers so that it does not have a big advantage. Last 
year, the U.S. trade deficit with China hit a record $57 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright also was scheduled to see Chinese President Jiang Zemin  
on Tuesday before returning to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Before seeing Zhu, Albright visited China Central Television  
studios and praised its ``Focal Point'' program, a ``60 
Minutes''-style nightly news show that often investigates low-level 
corruption among Chinese officials and others. 
</P>
<P>
	``A dynamic press that asks a lot of questions and promotes  
debate is very healthy,'' she said. ``I think what you're doing is 
very important and I salute you.''

<HEADLINE> IOC Members Defend Themselves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- IOC vice president Richard Pound's  
weary face told the story of another draining weekend investigating 
the 13 members entangled in the Olympic bribery scandal as his 
inquiry panel struggled to reach a conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound's six-member ad hoc committee spent two days going over  
evidence from a Salt Lake City report that more than $1.2 million 
in bribes were distributed to 24 IOC members -- a fifth of the 
membership. A handful of them made the trip to the Olympic capital 
to defend themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	An exhausted Pound said he hoped the inquiry panel would wrap up  
the investigation in the next few days and make recommendations to 
the IOC executive committee before its general assembly meets March 
17-18. 
</P>
<P>
	The final decision will be made by the general assembly, which  
will vote on expulsions and sweeping reforms to limit future 
potential for corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to complete the stuff we're working on, the report,  
sometime in the next week,'' said Pound, who admitted feeling 
pressure to quickly conclude the probe. ``We've got to let these 
folks know what's going on before the next session. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to stop the bleeding by March 17. Death by 1,000 cuts  
isn't much fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound was unclear exactly when the panel would reveal its  
findings. 
</P>
<P>
	After nine members resigned or were suspended in January in the  
first round of Pound's inquiry, the weekend meeting focused on 
three who remained under investigation and 10 new names that 
appeared in the Salt Lake report. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Coles of Australia, Ashwini Kumar of India and Agustin  
Arroyo of Ecuador, each suspected of corruption, traveled to IOC 
headquarters to defend themselves in person. Tight security 
prevented reporters from discovering if others were present and 
Pound declined to say how many showed up. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the higher-profile cases was that of Kim Un-yong, the  
powerful executive board member from South Korea and president of 
the confederation of Olympic sports bodies. He is accused of using 
his influence to get lucrative jobs in television and entertainment 
for his children. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, one of the most influential sports officials involved in  
the 2000 Sydney Olympics, was with the commission for about one 
hour, but refused to speak with the media throughout the weekend. 
The Australian was linked with lavish travel and vacations 
allegedly paid for by Salt Lake City bidders and has threatened 
legal action to clear his name. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake report also alleged Kumar was given a plane ticket  
to travel to the IOC meeting in Budapest where the 2002 Winter 
Games were awarded to the Utah resort. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't receive any ticket,'' said Kumar. He said that while  
the ticket receipt in the Salt Lake report bore the name Kumar, the 
first name was different. 
</P>
<P>
	Arroyo, a 30-year member of the IOC, said he'd chosen to plead  
his case in person because he was ``not at all satisfied'' with the 
committee's decision to suspend him and recommend his expulsion 
after the first phase of the investigation in January. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lot of wrong information from Salt Lake City. I  
don't like to use the word lie ... I just say it's not true,'' said 
the 75-year-old IOC veteran. 
</P>
<P>
	Arroyo was accused of accepting $19,000 in payments from Salt  
Lake bidders for himself and a family member, in addition to 
generous travel expenses for visits. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel also was expected to make a preliminary examination of  
files from about a dozen cities that bid for the Olympics between 
1996 and 2004. The IOC asked the cities to give details of any 
wrongdoing by IOC members during their bids.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Track Team Heads for Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dan O'Brien, the world record-holder in the  
heptathlon, and Suzy Hamilton, the national champion in the women's 
1,500 meters, were among the missing today when the U.S. track and 
field team left for the World Indoor Championships in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien did not go because he is not ready to compete against  
the world's best, while Hamilton has been bothered by a left 
Achilles injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the Americans sent a 46-member team -- 24 men and 22  
women -- to Maebashi, Japan, for the three-day championships, 
beginning Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Each country was allowed a maximum of two participants, by  
qualification, in each individual event, except for the 
multi-events -- the heptathlon for men, the pentathlon for women. 
Those were by invitation from the International Amateur Athletic 
Federation, the world governing body. 
</P>
<P>
	The multi-event invitations were based on last year's world  
outdoor rankings in the men's decathlon and women's heptathlon. On 
that basis, O'Brien, the world's top-ranked decathlete, was 
invited. 
</P>
<P>
	He declined because ``we don't think he's ready to compete at  
that level at this time,'' his coach, Rick Sloan, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't compete if we don't feel he's ready mentally and  
physically to dominate the competition and set a world record,'' 
Sloan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be ready for them outdoors.''  
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien competed in the 1993 indoor championships and set the  
world record of 6,476 points. 
</P>
<P>
	He also is the world record-holder in the decathlon with 8,891  
points, the 1996 Olympic gold medalist and a three-time world 
outdoor champion. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien's absence left Chris Huffins as the only American in the  
heptathlon. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, one of the world's premier middle-distance runners and  
a two-time Olympian, had been hurt two weeks before winning at 
Saturday's USA Championships at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Her absence left the U.S. with only one woman in the 1,500,  
Alisa Harvey. The women also had only one competitor in the 3,000, 
high jump and pentathlon, and none in the triple jump, because none 
qualified. 
</P>
<P>
	The men also were one short in the 800, high jump and triple  
jump.

<HEADLINE> More Original Content Found on Web </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Many newspapers and magazines are increasing the  
amount of original material on their Web sites, part of a shift 
toward using the Internet as a unique medium rather than an 
alternate distribution system. 
</P>
<P>
	In a survey being released Tuesday, 58 percent of newspapers and  
magazines had a Web site. Of those, 31 percent used original 
material for at least half their online content -- more than four 
times the number of publications that did so in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a bigger news hole and wonderful new storytelling  
tools,'' said Steve Ross, who conducted the survey. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he noted that the emphasis on round-the-clock coverage  
had its downside. 
</P>
<P>
	``Journalists often got the story wrong, concentrated on  
breaking news rather than features and skirted long-standing 
ethical practices,'' said Ross, a professor at Columbia 
University's Graduate School of Journalism. 
</P>
<P>
	As examples, he pointed to The Wall Street Journal's and The  
Dallas Morning News' retractions of online stories during the 
Monica Lewinsky scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Ross and a New York public relations firm questioned the  
business editors and managing editors of 1,420 daily newspapers and 
2,000 magazines last fall. This is the fifth year of the survey. 
</P>
<P>
	They found that although publications are developing more  
content specifically for the Web, only 18 percent routinely let 
their Web sites scoop their printed editions. Sixty-two percent 
never allowed it. 
</P>
<P>
	Ross also found that 2 percent of journalists said they had no  
access to the Internet, and only 5 percent said they never or 
almost never went online. 
</P>
<P>
	The full survey can be found Tuesday at

<HEADLINE> `60 Minutes' Follows Up Suicide Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Relatives of a man whose suicide at the hands of  
Dr. Jack Kevorkian was aired on ``60 Minutes'' last fall said they 
were upset with the show's follow-up segment, which focused on sick 
people who oppose assisted suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	The CBS newsmagazine show has come under fire from all sides.  
Many viewers spoke out against the November segment, which aired a 
video of Kevorkian apparently giving a lethal injection to Thomas 
Youk, a Waterford Township man with Lou Gehrig's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Now some are questioning the timing of the Sunday night segment,  
which came less than a week after ``60 Minutes'' correspondent Mike 
Wallace said at a symposium that he had second thoughts about 
airing the suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	During Sunday's story, one patient in a Connecticut hospice  
responded affirmatively when asked by Wallace whether she thought 
Youk had ``simply wimped out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just very upset in the way they handled the whole  
segment of the program,'' Youk's brother, Robert, said in today's 
editions of the Detroit Free Press. ``I thought they were going to 
show both sides, not just completely slanted to the other side from 
what Dr. Kevorkian was trying to do. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have got to be knowledgeable about where he was at that  
point in time,'' Youk said of his brother. ``He was in a very grave 
situation, and I believe he made the right choice, and we abided by 
that choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A man who suffers from the disease said the shows simply laid  
out both points of view. However, Edgar Sullivan, 55, of St. Clair 
Shores, said the Kevorkian tape bothered him and that he opposes 
assisted suicide for himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of mood swings, ups and downs, and it gets to  
the point where you might feel bad all the time. Every patient is 
different,'' Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``60 Minutes'' executive producer Don Hewitt said the follow-up  
story was simply a good idea suggested to them by a viewer and is 
not a sign that the show is backing off the Kevorkian segment. It 
also doesn't indicate that producers are particularly swayed by 
public pressure, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tape of Youk's injection death has been the main piece of  
evidence used to charge Kevorkian with first-degree murder, 
assisted suicide and illegal use of a controlled substance in 
Youk's death. His trial is scheduled to begin March 22.

<HEADLINE> 'Hothouse' an Imperfect Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Things are not going well at a government-run  
rest home operated by a rather peculiar set of English civil 
servants. First, one of the patients has died. Second, another has 
become pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
	Both incidents have befuddled Roote, the Col. Blimpish  
bureaucrat in charge of the institution. He fumes and fusses, 
possibly because he can't remember either inmate -- although he may 
be responsible for both occurrences. 
</P>
<P>
	Welcome to ``The Hothouse,'' an early, imperfect work by Harold  
Pinter, the British playwright famous for his silences and spartan 
use of words. ``The Hothouse'' is ``pre-pause'' Pinter, a dark 
comedy that is positively loquacious compared with the playwright's 
later, leaner efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Its new, splendid revival, courtesy of off-Broadway's Atlantic  
Theater Company, captures the comic zaniness of this bizarre 
environment where Monty Python meets George Orwell. If the 
production can't quite rise to the menace suggested by the play's 
dark finale, it may be more Pinter's fault than the production's. 
The comedy's last minutes seem an afterthought, unexpected without 
being satisfying in a way surprise endings sometimes are. 
</P>
<P>
	For much of the play, Roote banters with and bullies several  
toady assistants. Their language takes on the rhythm of a 
table-tennis match in which the ball veers off in unexpected 
directions. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Bryggman portrays the chief bureaucrat as if he were the  
institution's chief inmate as well. He is a hilarious mixture of 
exasperation and ignorance, of paranoia and pomposity. Jordan 
Lage's unctuous underling projects an icy disdain that never quite 
hides the smarminess of the character. 
</P>
<P>
	There is one unnerving segment when a cheerful new employee (the  
enthusiastic Liam Christopher O'Brien) submits to an experiment 
that suddenly turns into a not-so-subtle exercise in torture. 
</P>
<P>
	Director Karen Kohlhaas maintains a relentless pace throughout  
the evening. The verbal joustings are played out on a forbidding, 
sterile, all-white setting designed by Walt Spangler. It is one of 
the most lavish -- and effective -- the Atlantic has created. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Hothouse'' makes a contrasting companion piece to another  
Pinter work, ``Ashes to Ashes,'' which the Roundabout Theater 
Company currently is presenting at the Gramercy Theater. ``Ashes'' 
is Pinter at his most sparing, somber-sided and elliptical. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Hothouse'' is a youthful exercise, filled with the  
subversive enthusiasm of an author just starting to make his way in 
the theater. The play stumbles and occasionally falls but even in 
the tumbles there are signs that we are in the presence of a more 
than promising playwright.

<HEADLINE> VW Won't Comment on Beetle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Volkswagen said sales of the New Beetle were on  
track and refused to comment Monday on a report it was planning to 
introduce a cheaper version in Europe to move more cars. 
</P>
<P>
	VW spokesman Fred Baerbock in Wolfsburg said the company would  
wait until spring to make an assessment of New Beetle sales and 
decide on future strategy, including whether a second production 
facility should be opened. 
</P>
<P>
	He also defended sales so far, saying they were in line with  
Volkswagen's targets for 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	About 27,000 orders have been placed for the updated version of  
the round-top classic in Europe since it went on sale here in late 
November, Baerbock said. The company's goal for 1999 is to sell 
80,000 New Beetles in Europe, ``and I think the goal is 
realistic,'' he said, noting it had not yet been introduced in all 
European countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bild am Sonntag newspaper reported Sunday that VW was  
considering introducing a base model in Europe with a smaller 
engine and fewer extras that would sell for about $16,100, or 
$3,600 less than the current starting price, in the hopes of 
boosting sales. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, where the New Beetle went on sale in late  
March 1998, the car has become a cult item, with reports of long 
waiting lists and cars selling for a premium over the sticker price 
common. 
</P>
<P>
	The company predicted it would sell 50,000 in the first full  
year in the United States and Canada, but has already sold more 
than 61,000 in the United States alone, said a spokesman at the 
company's North American headquarters, Steve Keyes. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Beetle's U.S. base price is $15,900.

<HEADLINE> Phillies, Abreu Fail on Longer Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) -- Negotiations broke down Monday between  
Bobby Abreu's agent and the Philadelphia Phillies, who don't expect 
to get their starting right fielder signed to a multiyear contract 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Agent Peter Greenberg rejected general manager Ed Wade's  
four-year offer. The two sides disagree on how much service time 
Abreu should be credited with in terms of his yearly raises. 
</P>
<P>
	Abreu figures to be eligible for salary arbitration after the  
season as a ``Super 2,'' one of the players with 2-3 years of major 
league service whose arbitration rights were restored as part of 
the 1990 lockout settlement. As part of the deal, the top 17 
percent by service of those with 2-3 years in the majors can go to 
arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	His agent contends that Abreu's salary in subsequent seasons  
should reflect that extra year of service time. Wade disagrees, and 
will try to negotiate a one-year deal before the club-imposed 
Thursday deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made them a one-year offer,'' Wade said. ``We'll probably  
talk sometime on Wednesday again. I don't think we'll have any more 
multiyear discussions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An example of a Super 2 player who got a huge raise is Houston  
closer Billy Wagner, who agreed to a $10.3 million, three-year 
contract last month. The reliever, who has just 2 years, 139 days 
of major league service, made $280,000 last year and $185,000 in 
1997 after signing for the minimum $109,000 in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	His new contract calls for salaries of $2.1 million this year,  
$3.2 million in 2000 and $5 million in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Abreu, who turns 25 this month, has 1 year, 165 days of service.  
He is regarded as a rising star in the Phillies organization, 
batting .312 with 17 homers and 74 RBIs last season. He was third 
in the National League with 17 outfield assists.

<HEADLINE> Dad Convicted in Daughter's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PANAMA CITY, Fla. (AP) -- A man was convicted of drunken driving  
and vehicular homicide for the death of his 6-year-old daughter, 
who was blown out of the back of his pickup truck along with a 
plastic swimming pool. The girl was then hit by a car. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Sakemiller, convicted by a jury Friday, faces 10 or more  
years in state prison. He is to be sentenced March 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakemiller had taken his daughter, Catriona, to the store to buy  
the pool. She was sitting in it in the back of the truck as they 
headed home on June 15. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no water in the pool when wind stirred and blew  
Catriona and the pool into the street, police said. She apparently 
was not seriously hurt but died after she stood up in the street 
and was struck by a car. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people won't let their dogs ride in the back of the  
truck,'' prosecutor Mark Graham told the jury. ``Yet he put his 
daughter back there while he was drunk, at night, with a suspended 
license, on one of the busiest roads in Bay County.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Public Defender Floyd Griffith said it was an accident  
and that Sakemiller gave into his daughter's pleas to ride home in 
the pool. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury refused to convict Sakemiller of the more serious  
charges of drunken driving-manslaughter, aggravated manslaughter of 
a child and driving with a suspended license while causing death or 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	A test after more than two hours had passed showed Sakemiller  
had a .081 percent blood-alcohol level, just over the legal limit 
of .08 percent.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bad news for Nicole Kidman fans.  
</P>
<P>
	The last week of the ``The Blue Room,'' the sex-themed drama  
that included a brief glimpse of the actress naked, has been 
canceled because of Ms. Kidman's lingering bronchial infection. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am truly devastated not to complete the last week of the run  
and deeply apologize to the people who have planned to attend those 
performances,'' Ms. Kidman said in a statement Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The buzz about the nude scene made the ``The Blue Room'' one of  
Broadway's hottest tickets. The play was scheduled to end its 
sold-out run next Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kidman missed four performances last week because of the  
infection. The David Hare drama opened Dec. 13 and played 82 
performances, ending last Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Missing Sightseers Presumed Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MODESTO, Calif. (AP) -- Even though he believes three women who  
disappeared near Yosemite National Park are probably dead, the 
state's top FBI agent says investigators ``won't stop until we find 
out what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carole Sund, 43, her 15-year-old daughter, Julie, and Silvina  
Pelosso, a 16-year-old family friend from Argentina, were last seen 
on Feb. 15 in rural El Portal, leaving a restaurant near the lodge 
where they were staying. 
</P>
<P>
	But the women were not reported missing until Feb. 17, a day  
after they missed a rendezvous with other family members at San 
Francisco International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Though investigators ``don't have that concrete evidence that a  
crime occurred, we are all operating under the assumption that a 
crime did occur,'' said agent James M. Maddock on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be accurate to say we suspect foul play. ... I hope  
that gives you a sense of where we're headed,'' he said. ``I told 
the family we won't stop until we find out what happened and I'm 
confident that we will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 50 FBI agents have been working on the case. The  
women's relatives had converged on the area to help in the search. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, they ``understand that the probability of their loved ones  
being alive after this length of time is very small,'' Maddock 
said. ``But we always hold out that hope that a miracle could 
occur.''

<HEADLINE> Duke Realty Buys Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Duke Realty Investments Inc. will acquire  
Weeks Corp. for $1.1 billion in stock, extending its office and 
industrial real estate holdings from the Midwest into the 
Southeast. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced Monday also calls for Duke, an  
Indianapolis-based real estate investment trust, to assume about 
$654 million in Atlanta-based Weeks' debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company, which will be called Duke-Weeks Realty  
Corp. and be based in Indianapolis, will control more than 90 
million square feet of property, primarily for industrial and 
office use, and nearly 4,650 acres of undeveloped land. Annual 
revenues will top $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger agreement, already approved by both companies'  
boards, called for each share of Weeks stock to be exchanged for 
1.38 shares of Duke common stock. The deal is expected to close 
between April and June.

<HEADLINE> Pilot in Cable Car Case Defended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A Marine pilot's superiors didn't give  
him all the planning materials he needed before his jet severed an 
Italian ski gondola cable, killing 20 people, an officer who 
investigated the tragedy testified Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Col. Thomas Blickensderfer said the pilot, Capt. Richard Ashby,  
and his crew on the EA-6B Prowler planned the flight as well as 
they could with the information they were given. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we learned during the investigation was it was  
supervisory error and shouldn't have been done that way,'' he said 
on the last day of defense testimony at Ashby's court-martial. 
</P>
<P>
	The case may go to the eight-man military jury on Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., is charged with 20 counts  
of involuntary manslaughter and other counts, including failure to 
plan the mission properly. He could get more than 200 years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Ashby was reckless and violated the mission's  
517-mph speed limit and 2,000-foot altitude restriction. His jet 
cut a cable about 370 feet above the valley floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby said he thought the altitude restriction was 1,000 feet  
and claims he was unaware of a speed limit. His attorneys also 
contend that Ashby's map didn't have the gondola marked on it, his 
radar altitude gauge malfunctioned, and he suffered from an optical 
illusion that made him think he was flying higher than he was. 
</P>
<P>
	Blickensderfer was a member of the investigative board sent to  
Italy the day after the accident last year. He said the crew of the 
four-man radar-jamming jet obtained information for the flight from 
a well-established ``chart file'' in the squadron ready room at 
Aviano air base. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether Ashby should have inquired about new flight  
restrictions, Blickensderfer said it was the squadron's 
responsibility ``to provide anything that was new.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The conduct of the flight with what was available to the air  
crew was very reasonable,'' Blickensderfer said. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point during Blickensderfer's testimony, prosecutors and  
the judge, Lt. Col. Robert Nunley, claimed he had contradicted his 
own testimony at a December hearing that the accident was the 
crew's fault. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge declared a 45-minute recess while attorneys checked  
the court reporter's record from the hearing, but on 
cross-examination the prosecutor only alluded to the alleged 
discrepancy. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby's navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, faces similar  
charges and a separate court-martial.

<HEADLINE> Talks Continue Over Redwoods Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Hours before a midnight deadline,  
government authorities and Pacific Lumber Co. executives met 
privately Monday to try to revive a $480 million plan to turn 
ancient redwood groves into a public preserve. 
</P>
<P>
	Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, state resources officials and  
company executives and lawyers were involved in the negotiations, 
taking place in Eureka and via telephone conference calls between 
California and Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope they'll change their minds,'' Vice President Al Gore  
said in an interview with The Associated Press during his visit to 
Oakland. ``We think what was proposed is good for the American 
people, good for California, good for the environment and good for 
this company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would have had Pacific Lumber and an allied logging  
firm sell 10,000 acres of the Headwaters Forest -- including about 
5,000 acres of old-growth redwoods -- to the United States and 
California. Some of the trees are 1,500 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	After years of negotiations, Pacific Lumber rejected the  
government's final offer on Friday, saying proposed restrictions on 
logging near streams and wildlife habitats in other company 
properties would ruin it financially. 
</P>
<P>
	Barring a last-minute change of position, the federal  
appropriation -- and the state money as well, was to disappear at 
11:59 p.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said the government wasn't backing off the terms it  
proposed as part of the deal. ``All we're doing is clarifying our 
position so it is fully understood,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	State and company officials declined comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Pacific Lumber and its corporate parent, Maxxam Corp., have been  
the object of lengthy court fights and demonstrations -- including 
the nation's largest forest rally, a 1996 environmental protest in 
which more than 1,000 people were arrested.

<HEADLINE> Testaverde Signs With Jets for $19M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Vinny and the Jets have extended their marriage  
by at least three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Vinny Testaverde, who led the New York Jets within a victory of  
the Super Bowl last season, Monday signed a three-year contract 
worth nearly $19.5 million to remain with his hometown team. The 
deal also includes a $6.2 million signing bonus and the Jets hold a 
four-year option beyond the original three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no bigger stage than New York City,'' said Testaverde,  
who heads into his 13th NFL season as one of the five highest-paid 
quarterbacks in the league. ``And to come in and perform well there 
was great for me, knowing it was in front of my family and friends. 
The team had not been to the playoffs in quite awhile and they made 
me feel right at home and part of the team right away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Testaverde, the 1986 Heisman Trophy winner and top overall draft  
choice in 1987 by Tampa Bay, grew up in Elmont, N.Y., not far from 
where the Jets train. He signed as a free agent before last season, 
ostensibly to be a backup to Glenn Foley. But Foley got hurt, then 
was ineffective, and Testaverde, 35, was sensational when he became 
the starter. 
</P>
<P>
	He went 13-2, leading the AFC in passing and taking the Jets to  
their first division title since the team joined the NFL in 1970. 
Testaverde completed 259 of 421 passes for 3,256 yards and a 
team-record 29 touchdowns. The Jets advanced to the AFC title game, 
losing to Denver 23-10. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the success we had as a team and individually,'' he  
said, ``in my heart I just wanted to get this deal done with the 
Jets. This year was the best of my career. I think there were 
reasons for that and the biggest reason was (Jets coach) Bill 
Parcells. I wanted to remain with him so I can continue to have 
that success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To remain with the Jets, Testaverde virtually ignored any other  
offers when he became a free agent last month. His new deal should 
be his final NFL contract and also includes incentives that could 
be worth as much as $2.5 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pleased to be able to get this contract done,'' Parcells  
said. ``We look forward to working with Vinny again and hopefully 
seeing him and the team both improve their performance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement of the deal was postponed after Testaverde's  
father, Al, died of a heart attack Feb. 14. Al Testaverde's heart 
condition prohibited him from watching his son's games live. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last few weeks have been a roller coaster,'' Testaverde  
said. ``One thing I am still thankful for is my father got to enjoy 
a great season after my being away from my family my first 11 years 
in the NFL. I had the opportunity to come home last year and see 
him at training camp each day, knowing he couldn't watch the games 
on TV. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I was able to see him on a regular basis and talk with him  
on the contract negotiations. I'm very happy I got to share that 
time with him.''

<HEADLINE> USOC Ethics Report To Be Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For the last three months, the International  
Olympic Committee has dealt with the biggest scandal in its 
history, the million-dollar bribery case stemming from Salt Lake's 
winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the IOC is about to get some advice -- and maybe some blame  
-- from an elite ethics report. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel, chaired by former Senate Majority Leader George  
Mitchell, releases its report today. While it worked behind closed 
doors through the early morning to finish its task, it appeared the 
IOC's role in the Salt Lake case -- and what it could do to avoid 
such scandals in the future -- was a prominent part of the 
commission's agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	A source with knowledge of the investigation told The Associated  
Press on Sunday night that the IOC's role in the scandal and its 
cleanup was likely to be a focus of the Mitchell report. 
</P>
<P>
	``The report will include some really creative things that the  
IOC should do to go forward, things we haven't heard about 
before,'' the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC already has expelled five members and is investigating  
13 others in connection with the scandal. It has announced plans to 
radically change the way it selects Olympic host cities and even 
break its historic secrecy by submitting to frequent audits and 
issuing financial reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell said last week his panel would focus on future bids to  
try to make sure the vote-buying scheme of Salt Lake is not 
repeated. 
</P>
<P>
	The next games for an American city to bid on won't be held  
until 2012, but the route to those Olympics will be laid out today 
in Mitchell's report. 
</P>
<P>
	``The emphasis will be on recommendations for rules, compliance  
and enforcement which we hope, if adopted, will avoid a recurrence 
of the type of action that led to the creation of the commission,'' 
Mitchell said last week. 
</P>
<P>
	That probably will mean strict limits or the elimination of  
gifts from bid cities to IOC members, the heart of the Salt Lake 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, which staged the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta  
and will play host to the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake, won't 
have another chance until the IOC picks the city for 2012. Eight 
U.S. cities are vying to be the American candidate for that race, 
which will be decided in 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell and the rest of his panel, including former White House  
chief of staff Ken Duberstein and baseball union leader Donald 
Fehr, refused to discuss details of their two-month inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission submits its report to the U.S. Olympic  
Committee's executive board just before releasing it at a news 
conference. The USOC is to respond at its own news conference 
Wednesday in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell's commission is a standing ethics watchdog for the  
USOC, appointed last year by committee president Bill Hybl. But to 
underscore the commission's independence, no USOC officials will 
share the stage with Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
	While the IOC and Salt Lake City Olympic officials have been  
damaged in the scandal, the USOC has escaped virtually unscathed. 
But two areas in which it did take hits are expected to be 
mentioned by the Mitchell report. 
</P>
<P>
	One is staff oversight. Alfredo la Mont resigned as the USOC's  
director of international relations last month after it was 
revealed he did consulting work for Salt Lake bid leader Tom Welch. 
Olympic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said at the 
time that La Mont was paid to gather information on IOC members in 
Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Another is training programs for foreign athletes. The USOC  
regularly provides facilities and supervision at its training 
centers for athletes from other nations, usually from the Third 
World. 
</P>
<P>
	While such programs are seen to epitomize the Olympic ideals of  
competition and fairness, cases in the United States and Australia 
showed they could also be used to help bid committees foster 
goodwill with attractive packages offered around voting time. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell also may take aim at the IOC, either in the report or  
in a separate statement, according to sources familiar with the 
investigation who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	As with two reports into Salt Lake already released, Mitchell's  
commission lacked subpoena power and had to rely heavily on public 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	It received almost 200,000 documents from USOC files as well as  
responses from letters sent to some 400 present and former 
committee officials and staff members. The letter asked about gifts 
they received from Salt Lake or other cities hoping to be America's 
candidate for the 1998 and 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	All gifts, which could be as mundane as T-shirts or as  
extravagant as ski trips, are expected to be banned under upcoming 
USOC and IOC reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington will keep a close eye on the Mitchell report and USOC  
response, plus action by a special IOC assembly in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department is investigating possible bribery, mail  
fraud and tax violations in the Salt Lake scandal, and the Senate 
Commerce Committee is considering hearings on the Olympics that 
could be aimed at punishing the IOC.

<HEADLINE> Study: New Hay Fever Drug Effective </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc.'s experimental hay  
fever medication ebastin was more effective than market leader 
Claritin in reducing sneezing, runny noses and itchy eyes, 
according to a rare head-to-head study. 
</P>
<P>
	Ebastin, which is awaiting federal Food and Drug Administration  
approval, hopes to join Claritin as the only one-a-day, 
non-sedating antihistamine available in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Claritin, made by Schering-Plough Corp., dominates the  
prescription antihistamine market. About half of all new 
antihistamine prescriptions are for Claritin, which had about $1.9 
billion in U.S. sales last year, according to IMS Health, a market 
data firm. 
</P>
<P>
	At the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology annual  
meeting here this week, two ebastin versus Claritin studies are 
being presented involving a total of about 1,100 patients in Texas 
and Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ohio study showed patients receiving ebastin fared better,  
but it was not statistically significant. The Texas study was 
conclusive that patients with ebastin had significantly fewer of 
all major symptoms, researchers said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ebastin study conducted in Texas by researchers at the  
University of Texas showed patients were 43 percent less likely to 
suffer from the traditional hay fever symptoms compared to 
Claritin. Rhone-Poulenc, based in Collegeville, Pa. paid for both 
studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Ebastin will get a lot of attention from doctors because of the  
head-to-head comparison, said Dr. Michael Schatz, an allergist at 
Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in San Diego and board member of 
the academy. 
</P>
<P>
	``So many new drugs are compared against a placebo (dummy pill)  
and that does not help providers,'' Schatz said. ``This study is 
significant because it shows how a new drug compares against the 
standard which is Claritin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 35 million Americans suffer from hay fever, known  
medically as allergic rhinitis. The condition is triggered by 
airborne pollen which emanates seasonally from grass, ragweed and 
trees. Hay fever season gets under way later this month in most 
parts of U.S. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the introduction and heavy marketing of new prescription  
drugs, just 13 percent of hay fever patients visit a doctor for the 
condition, according to a 1997 study. Instead, most patients grin 
and bear the runny nose, sneezing and watery eyes or use less 
effective over-the-counter medications. 
</P>
<P>
	That unmet need has helped convince companies such as  
Rhone-Poulenc to enter the hay fever market. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer Inc.'s Zyrtec and Hoechst Marion Roussel Inc.'s Allegra  
are the only competitors to Claritin. But the FDA says Zyrtec 
causes drowsiness and Allegra is taken twice a day. Both are major 
marketing disadvantages for the companies. Hoechst is seeking 
federal approval for a one-a day version. 
</P>
<P>
	Ebastin, which is the drug's generic name, is now used in more  
than 25 countries in Europe and Asia. Rhone-Poulenc sought FDA 
approval in March 1997 for use in the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
	Most drug studies only involve a test medication and a dummy  
pill. Head-to-head studies of competing drugs are rare because drug 
makers may end up paying for studies that show a rival drug is more 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
	If ebastin is approved, Rhone-Poulenc could gain a marketing  
edge from the study. 
</P>
<P>
	``By most parameters, ebastin was more effective than  
Claritin,'' said Dr. Paul Ratner, a San Antonio allergist and 
co-investigator on the Texas study. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that patients getting ebastin were less likely to have  
hay fever symptoms, and less likely to drop out of the study 
because of the drug's failure. 
</P>
<P>
	In both studies, a 20 milligram form of ebastin was compared  
against the 10 milligram Claritin, the most common dose. The higher 
dosage of ebastin should not cause any alarm because the two drugs 
are different chemical compositions, Ratner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schering spokesman Bill O'Donnell stressed that Rhone-Poulenc  
paid for the study. But the study was peer-reviewed by researchers 
before being presented at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Schering is in late stage human testing of a second-generation  
Claritin, which may be more potent and have less interactions with 
other drugs.

<HEADLINE> Ford To Settle With Fed Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. is expected to reach a settlement  
soon that will require it to pay between $250,000 and $500,000 in 
civil fines for withholding documents during a federal safety 
agency's investigation of fires in Ford cars and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement should be signed in the next three weeks, a  
source close to the negotiations said Monday, speaking on condition 
of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue in the case are allegations by attorneys for State Farm  
Insurance that Ford failed to disclose documents as required to the 
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The documents 
related to steering-column fires believed caused by defective 
ignition switches on some Ford vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	State Farm asked the agency last year to rule whether Ford was  
guilty of nondisclosure. 
</P>
<P>
	The insurer is suing Ford to recover millions of dollars it says  
it paid in claims for fire damage caused by the switches. Ford 
recalled 8.7 million vehicles in 1996 to replace the ignition 
switches -- the largest recall by a single automaker in U.S. 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ford maintains only a fraction of the just over 1,300  
steering column fires reported out of 23.5 million Ford vehicles 
built from 1988 to 1993 were possibly related to the switches. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford has said it made a mistake last year when it told the  
agency that it had provided a document when, in fact, it had not. 
Ford maintains that other documents cited by State Farm either were 
disclosed or revealed redundant information. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we believe we have always been responsive to NHTSA,  
going forward, we will hew to the plain meaning of any agency 
request for `all' documents,'' Ford spokesman Jim Cain said. ``Our 
policy will be to err on the side of providing too much 
information, even if it means duplication.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agency last year criticized Ford for not disclosing enough  
information in two earlier safety investigations. In each case, the 
disclosure charges were brought by attorneys suing Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	``Never again do we want to find ourselves in the position of  
having to defend our reputation and products because a plaintiff's 
attorney can point to a handful of documents -- some of which may 
not be material or relevant -- that may not have been submitted to 
NHTSA during an investigation,'' Cain said.

<HEADLINE> Match Play Golf Scores in Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tiger Woods and other top 20 golfers were gone  
before the weekend, but viewers watched the Match Play Championship 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's playoff victory by Jeff Maggert over Andrew Magee for a  
$1 million prize posted a 4.2 overnight rating and a 9 share. 
Saturday's semifinals had a 3.0/8. 
</P>
<P>
	The event, featuring a head-to-head single-elimination format  
that hadn't been used since the 1980s, was the first in a series of 
three World Golf Championships this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just think these are terrific numbers given it's a new  
event,'' ABC spokesman Mark Mandel said. ``It's an unfamiliar 
format for viewers and with all the top seeds knocked out and not 
playing over the weekend, we are very happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament fared better than college basketball, but not as  
good as the NBA. CBS' six college games posted a combined 2.0 
overnight rating and a 5 share. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Tiger lost, people were talking about poor old ABC,''  
Mandel said. ``But it didn't turn out that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's NBA tripleheader Sunday gained a 5.6/12 average, including  
a 7.7/14 overnight mark for Dennis Rodman's Lakers debut against 
the Rockets. It was the network's highest overnight rating this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	It is difficult to compare the Match Play Championship to other  
golf tournaments because of the format, but last year's Nissan 
Open, played the same weekend, posted a 5.9 overnight rating for 
Sunday's final round. 
</P>
<P>
	However, CBS benefited from Woods being in contention at the  
Nissan Open. He lost to Billy Mayfair in a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	The rating is the percentage of TV households in the nation  
tuned to a program, and each point represents 994,000 homes. The 
share is the percentage tuned to a program among those televisions 
on at the time.

<HEADLINE> Sprewell OK To Return to Knicks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Latrell Sprewell was cleared Monday to return to  
practice for the New York Knicks after spending three weeks 
sidelined with a stress fracture of his right heel. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell remained on the injured list Monday night as the Knicks  
played Cleveland, and he was not expected to play Tuesday night at 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	A return could be possible when the Knicks play Friday night at  
Milwaukee or Sunday afternoon at home against New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	``It depends,'' Sprewell said. ``If I'm having a lot of soreness  
after this practice (Tuesday morning), then I'm going to have to 
back off. If it feels good, or if there's just a little pain that I 
can deal with, then at the earliest Friday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell, acquired in January from the Golden State Warriors for  
John Starks, Chris Mills and Terry Cummings, played in only two 
games for the Knicks -- both losses -- before being diagnosed with 
the injury. He was averaging 14.5 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``Initially, he's going to play off the bench,'' Van Gundy said.  
``I don't know how it's going to work from there. I haven't decided 
yet if that (as a sixth man) is how he's going to be used.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell has been running and shooting around with the team for  
the past week. No new X-rays were taken Monday before the team's 
medical staff cleared him to return.

<HEADLINE>  Giants QB Denies Being Racist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Denying he was racist and saying he  
was addressing an alcohol problem, quarterback Kerry Collins began 
offseason workouts with New York Giants on Monday in what might be 
a final attempt to salvage a once-promising career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people have a lot of questions about me and I am  
excited to have to opportunity to prove them wrong,'' Collins said 
in his first official interview since signing a four-year, $16.9 
million contract as free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	The move created a stir not only because the Giants then  
released Danny Kanell, who led them to the playoffs in 1997, but 
because it also put starter Kent Graham's job in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a salary that makes him the Giants' highest paid player,  
Collins said he understands his role as a backup. The former 
first-round pick in the 1995 NFL Draft also said that he is tired 
of all the negative perceptions about him, that he has taken steps 
to get his life back in order and that he has the skills to be a 
very good NFL quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	During most of the interview Collins dealt with his  
off-the-field problems: 
</P>
<P>
	-- A bad joke in the Carolina Panthers' locker room that got him  
labeled a racist. 
</P>
<P>
	-- His release on Oct. 13 after reportedly telling then-Panthers  
coach Dom Capers that he didn't have the heart for pro football. 
</P>
<P>
	-- His arrest on drunken driving charges in Charlotte, N.C.,  
after he signed with New Orleans and returned with the Saints to 
play the Panthers two weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Penn State quarterback, who led Carolina to the NFC  
title game in 1996, spoke most about his alcohol use. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel alcohol certainly played a role in my life and that it  
may have played too much of a role in my life,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins would not discuss the details of the racial incident,  
but it was the subject he was most passionate about. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as the racial thing goes, to my dying day I will deny  
the fact that I am a racist,'' said Collins, who is white. ``I 
mean, I know what kind of person I am. I know what my beliefs are 
and I know how I feel about things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Given the chance, he said, teammates would like the man they  
found. Giants players seemed willing to do that. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kerry is his own man,'' receiver Ike Hilliard said.  
``Everybody has done some things and lived their life the way they 
wanted to. He doesn't have to answer questions or hold himself 
accountable for anything he's done. He's one of my teammates. I'm 
behind him 100 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard from a lot of his close friends (that) he is not  
that type of guy,'' fullback Charles Way said. ``Everybody makes 
mistakes and you have to put it behind you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Way and Hilliard are black.  
</P>
<P>
	When asked about being a quitter, Collins said he never stopped  
giving his all, although there were times when it was hard to do 
that. After taking a long, hard look at himself, Collins said he 
has taken steps to correct the problems and to be less of an enigma 
than he has been. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have rededicated myself to the game,'' he said. ``I realize  
that I love football and football is very important to me. To be 
quite honest, some of the things that have gone on in my personal 
life took away from what I was trying to do on the football field. 
I'm still working on things, things in my personal life that I 
needed to address.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giants coach Jim Fassel insisted on Monday that Graham is his  
starter and that Collins won't be rushed into anything. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has to play better than what he has demonstrated as a  
quarterback,'' said Fassel, who wants to work on Collins' 
fundamentals and footwork. ``It's going to take time and practicing 
and practicing and practicing.''

<HEADLINE> Bison Management Courses at College / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ROCKFORD, N.D. (AP) -- Native culture and business interests  
are leading to a growth in buffalo management courses at Indian 
colleges. 
</P>
<P>
	At Cankdeska Cikana Community College on the Spirit Lake  
reservation, teacher Melinda Martin says the school tries to 
balance different approaches to address the burgeoning interest in 
the topic. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bison education movement in tribal colleges is amazing  
right now,'' Martin said. ``We try to cover every aspect of it. 
Some students are into it commercially. Some are into it as a 
cultural thing. We like to keep it in the middle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The school, also known as Little Hoop Community College, will be  
offering a two-year associate science degree in bison management 
through its agricultural education program. 
</P>
<P>
	The bison are considered a vital link to Indians' existence, she  
said. Before the arrival of Europeans on the Northern Plains, the 
bison provided Indians with food and shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without the bison, they would not be here,'' Martin said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Northern Plains Bison Education Network, a group of tribal  
colleges, also is developing courses in managing the animals. The 
network director, Louis LaRose, said most tribal colleges are 
offering courses. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Weisenburger and his father started raising bison in 1992,  
trying to find an alternative to wheat. Students in Martin's class 
go to his ranch and others in the region to learn the bison 
business close-up. 
</P>
<P>
	While much of the course content involves nutrition, grazing  
systems, breeding and the business aspects of raising bison, the 
opportunity to have hands-on experience in working with the animals 
is important, Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
	America's bison population is estimated at 200,000. Indians  
control about 10,000 of the animals, the Inter-Tribal Bison 
Cooperative says. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranchers in North Dakota and elsewhere have been working to  
market bison meat nationally. The North American Bison Cooperative 
is based in New Rockford. 
</P>

	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Millions of sterile Mediterranean fruit  
flies will be released in the Miami area next week in an effort to 
keep the fertile version of the crop-destroying pest at bay. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans call for the release of about 15 million flies weekly  
through June over 100 square miles of Miami-Dade County. Sterile 
flies are expected to mate with any other flies still around, 
interrupting the month-long life cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been Medfly-free in Florida since Oct. 8, 1998, and  
we're hopeful that this preventative release program will help us 
stay that way,'' said Florida's agriculture commissioner Bob 
Crawford. 
</P>
<P>
	The Medfly, smaller than a household fly, targets 250 kinds of  
vegetables and fruits, especially citrus. It burrows through the 
skin to deposit larvae, eventually causing the fruit to rot. State 
officials fear an infestation could affect Florida's $7 billion 
agriculture industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Two flies were caught in the Miami Springs area north of Miami  
International Airport in May, prompting authorities to set up a 
fruit-transfer quarantine and chemical attack area, which was 
discontinued in August after no more flies were found. 
</P>
<P>
	The release program is designed to overwhelm any small number of  
wild flies that may have entered the country in infested fruits or 
vegetables, eliminating them before they have a chance to breed.

<HEADLINE>  U.S. Planes Strike at Iraq Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSUL, Iraq (AP) -- A new round of U.S. airstrikes hit northern  
Iraq today, a day after an American attack wrecked an Iraqi pumping 
station that sends oil through a pipeline to Turkey, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. F15-Es dropped more than 30 laser-guided missiles this  
afternoon over the northern no-fly zone in response to several 
incidents of Iraqi radar locking on the aircraft, Capt. Michael 
Blass of U.S. European Command in Germany said. 
</P>
<P>
	Missiles struck Iraqi communications sites, radar relay sites  
and anti-aircraft artillery sites. No damage was reported to the 
aircraft, Blass said. 
</P>
<P>
	The incidents happened in the vicinity of Mosul, a city about  
250 miles north of Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
	Blass denied Iraqi reports that U.S. planes hit or targeted an  
Iraqi oil pipeline running through to Turkey or one of its pumping 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the Iraqi government took journalists to the oil pumping  
station, which appeared to have been destroyed. One person was 
killed in the attack Sunday and two were wounded, Iraqi officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Col. Richard Bridges said  
officials were investigating whether the facility may have served a 
dual purpose: a communications link in Iraq's air defense system as 
well as a link in pipeline operations. 
</P>
<P>
	In Turkey, an official at the oil terminal in the port of Ceyhan  
confirmed the flow of petroleum had stopped after the attack. U.N. 
officials in Baghdad also confirmed the interruption. 
</P>
<P>
	The pipeline, which runs from northern Iraq to Ceyhan, is the  
only functioning pipeline in Iraq and one of only two outlets for 
oil exports. The other is the Gulf terminal of Mina al-Bakr. 
</P>
<P>
	An Iraqi oil official, Ashour Kan'an, said about 75 percent of  
the station was destroyed and that repairs will cost $750,000. The 
station is 25 miles west of Mosul. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a few days, we expect to resume operations using  
alternative parts,'' he told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have said 56 percent of Iraq's oil exports flow  
through the pipeline. The country is exporting 2.1 million barrels 
a day under the oil-for-food program, which provides an exemption 
to U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	The program enables the Iraqi government to sell oil on  
condition that the revenue is spent on food, medicine and 
humanitarian goods for the country's 22 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and British planes, which patrol no-fly zones over northern  
and southern Iraq, have been striking Iraqi military sites on an 
almost daily basis since December. 
</P>
<P>
	The zones were set up after the 1991 Gulf War to protect Kurdish  
rebels in the north and Shiite Muslims insurgents in the south.

	An Iraqi oil official, Ashour Kan'an, said about 75 percent of  
the station was destroyed and that repairs will cost $750,000. The 
station is 25 miles west of Mosul. 
</P>

	``In a few days, we expect to resume operations using  
alternative parts,'' he told The Associated Press.

	Officials have said 56 percent of Iraq's oil exports flow  
through the pipeline. The country is exporting 2.1 million barrels 
a day under the oil-for-food program, which provides an exemption 
to U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	The program enables the Iraqi government to sell oil on  
condition that the revenue is spent on food, medicine and 
humanitarian goods for the country's 22 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and British planes, which patrol no-fly zones over northern  
and southern Iraq, have been striking Iraqi military sites on an 
almost daily basis since December. 
</P>
<P>
	The zones were set up after the 1991 Gulf War to protect Kurdish  
rebels in the north and Shiite Muslims insurgents in the south.

<HEADLINE> Mobile Phone Price Wars Heat Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Hong Kong's six mobile phone providers are in a  
mad scramble to buy customer loyalty -- offering up noodles, cash 
and free phone calls -- following a change that allows users to 
change companies more easily. 
</P>
<P>
	The territory's ubiquitous mobile phone users gained the ability  
Monday to switch service providers while keeping the same number, 
pushing the phone companies into a battle for market share. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts predicted a lot of switching will take place in the  
next few weeks, though they had their doubts about whether the new 
competition in an already cutthroat industry will be intense enough 
to run any of the market's six players out of business. 
</P>
<P>
	The end result will be ``net neutral, with some losers here and  
there,'' said Derek Chan, telecommunications analyst at Bear 
Stearns Asia Ltd. ``The market is big enough for six players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 3 million Hong Kong residents -- 40 percent of the  
population of one of the world's most congested cities -- have 
mobile telephones. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the territory, there is little respite from the ringing.  
In some movie theaters, it's almost impossible to sit through the 
film without being interrupted. The phones go off in shops and 
restaurants, although some elite establishments have imposed bans. 
</P>
<P>
	It's all music to the ears of the telephone executives.  
</P>
<P>
	One of the industry's top players, Hongkong Telecom, is giving  
away noodles and yogurt drinks to promote its ``free lunch'' deal 
which allows customers to make free local calls at lunchtime for 
three months. Local phone calls usually cost anywhere from 10 cents 
33 cents per minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Doling out cold cash is the tactic at rival SmarTone which is  
offering $38 and two months of free calls to customers who switch 
from other network providers. Others are sticking to the more 
traditional route of slashing prices and giving extended discounts, 
offering customers a vast range of deals.

<HEADLINE>  U.N. Land-Mine Treaty Takes Effect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- An international treaty to ban land mines that  
kill and maim some 25,000 people each year entered into force 
today, hailed by ceremonies, choirs, and bells of peace. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty, concluded in Ottawa in 1997, has been signed by 133  
countries and ratified by 65 of them. About 12 countries have 
destroyed their entire stocks of land mines. 
</P>
<P>
	Major users and producers -- including the United States, Russia  
and China -- have refused to join in. And even with the treaty, it 
will take still take decades to clear the tens of millions of mines 
scattered in more than 60 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``The battle ahead is to make this treaty full effective not  
just in law but also in implementation,'' U.N. Secretary-General 
Kofi Annan said in a message to the ceremony in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not just in the capitals of the signatories but also in the  
fields and forests where mines still exist; not just in principle 
but in practice,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Underlining the problems, two children were killed and six  
others seriously wounded when a land mine exploded in northern 
Rwanda, Rwandan radio reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty, agreed to after a campaign by charities working with  
victims, commits signatories to ban production, use, stocks and 
exports of land mines. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has set 2006 as a target for joining the  
accord -- saying the United States needs to use mines until then 
along the tense border between North and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Seats for the U.S. delegation were conspicuously empty at the  
start of a ceremony marking the land mines accord at U.N. 
headquarters in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
	The sounds of a ``peace bell'' and a children's choir floated  
through U.N. offices in Vienna, Austria, to mark the accord coming 
into force. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Walker, coordinator of the International Campaign to Ban  
Land Mines -- which won the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize -- said her group 
would this year focus its campaign on the Middle East and former 
Soviet Union to try to persuade them to go along with the accord. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause also was supported by Princess Diana. Diana drew  
attention to the issue by making a highly publicized walk through a 
minefield in Angola in February 1997. She died in a car crash in 
Paris on Aug. 31 of that year.

<HEADLINE> IMF: New Loan to Brazil Is Imminent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new loan agreement with Brazil is imminent,  
the head of the International Monetary Fund, Michel Camdessus, said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Camdessus told the Institute of International Bankers that  
economic revisions and structural reforms to underpin the revised 
accord have largely been completed. He said negotiators from the 
two sides are working out final details this week. 
</P>
<P>
	But it could be several more weeks before the IMF and other  
lenders release the second $9 billion installment of the $41.5 
billion rescue package assembled in November for Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are now at a final stage of putting together necessary  
amendments to our arrangement of last November with Brazil, to 
introduce the changes required by the floating of the real,'' 
Camdessus said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last January Brazilian authorities let Brazil's real float  
freely against other currencies, stanching a flow of reserves which 
were leaving the country at a rate of about a billion dollars a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have advanced a lot. We are now dealing with the nitty  
gritty of the arrangement. The agreement will be a solid one,'' 
Camdessus said. 
</P>
<P>
	He reassured his audience of private-sector bankers they will  
not be required to play any formal role under the new agreement 
between the IMF and Brazil but said they may be asked to help in 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Turning to Russia, Camdessus said he has told authorities in  
Moscow he is not satisfied with the economic strategy Russia has 
adopted to secure international support. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he recognizes Russian interest in settling its debt  
obligations on good terms with international creditors, but added 
it will be a ``protracted and difficult business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has $17.5 billion in foreign debt due this year and hopes  
to work out a payment schedule with its creditors, relying in part 
on a resumption of IMF loans. Camdessus said it is not in Russia's 
interest for the IMF to make additional loans to it on favorable 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF suspended its $22.6 billion loan program to Russia after  
the country plunged into financial crisis in August and defaulted 
on some of its debts. The IMF wants Russia to implement a viable 
economic program before it resumes the loan program.

<HEADLINE> GOP Hopefuls Woo Veterans' Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John McCain, decorated Vietnam veteran  
and likely Republican presidential candidate, wooed members of one 
of the nation's largest veterans' organizations on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona senator spoke before a crowd of about 2,000 at the  
Veterans of Foreign Wars candidates forum. He was joined by Sen. 
Bob Smith, R-N.H., who announced his candidacy in February,and 
former Tennessee governor Lamar Alexander, who will formally 
announce his candidacy next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Increased funding for veterans' health care and benefits and  
military preparedness dominated all three candidates' speeches. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was McCain, a highly decorated former naval pilot who was  
shot down over Vietnam and held as a prisoner of war for almost six 
years, who connected with VFW members. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your contributions to our country deserve to be commemorated  
in something greater than bronze or marble,'' said McCain, who 
expressed indignation at his perception of the Clinton 
administration's treatment of veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans should show the same concern for your well-being as  
you once showed for ours,'' McCain urged in calling for increased 
funding for veterans' health care and added benefits and pay for 
current military personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	He called the Clinton administration's funding for veterans'  
health care ``disgraceful,'' and promised that ``as president I 
would fully honor America's debt to you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain also argued for increased military spending and  
preparedness. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every commander-in-chief's first responsibility is the  
security of our nation,'' McCain said. ``All others rank behind 
that.''

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Industry Begins Its Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- After nearly two months without a live witness and  
several days of lawyers' wrangling over evidence, the tobacco 
industry is poised to begin its defense in the first class-action 
lawsuit by smokers to reach trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for an estimated 500,000 Florida smokers are seeking at  
least $200 billion from defendants including Philip Morris, Inc., 
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., and other cigarette makers and industry 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	In the trial's first phase, jurors will determine whether the  
defendants are responsible for injuries the plaintiffs claim they 
suffered because they were deceived into taking up a habit they 
couldn't quit. 
</P>
<P>
	If the tobacco companies are found liable, the jury will then  
decide which of the named plaintiffs should receive punitive 
damages. After that, other smokers could pursue their own trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Defendants say the risks of smoking have been well publicized  
for years and smokers can quit if they try. Their lawyers were 
scheduled to begin their presentation today. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward L. Sweda, senior attorney with the Boston-based Tobacco  
Products Liability Project, said the industry lawyers won't be able 
to use some of their favorite defenses, such as blaming the smoker. 
</P>
<P>
	``The jury's focus, particularly in the initial phase, is on the  
industry's conduct,'' Sweda said. ``So (the industry is) in a very 
difficult position to try to explain away the long history of what 
they have done, and what their own documents spell out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors in the trail, which began Oct. 19, got a break of more  
than two weeks while lawyers argued over admissibility in court of 
thousands of documents. Among the evidence admitted by the judge 
are letters detailing attempts to influence scientists' 
interpretations of research and figure out ways to keep negative 
findings from being used against the industry in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the trial began, the tobacco industry has been dealt a  
blow via the Feb. 10 verdict in a California smoker's trial. 
Patricia Henley, a former three-pack-a-day smoker with inoperable 
lung cancer, contended Philip Morris had concealed the risks and 
addictiveness of smoking -- some of same issues raised in the 
Florida case. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors awarded Ms. Henley $51.5 million. Of that, $50 million  
was punitive damages, far exceeding the $15 million her attorneys 
had sought.

<HEADLINE> Cos. To Link Appliances To Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For years, manufacturers have touted  
technologies that would let people easily access the Internet via 
``smart'' phones, or order pizza by touching a flat screen attached 
to the refrigerator door. 
</P>
<P>
	But a hodgepodge of technical standards made it tough to link  
the gadgets in a network. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of 15 leading technology companies says they want to fix  
that. 
</P>
<P>
	International Business Machines Corp., Motorola Corp. and Sun  
Microsystems Inc. were among the companies that agreed Monday to 
create a common technical standard to easily link a future 
generation of gadgets and appliances to each other and the 
Internet. The standard, called the Open Service Gateway 
Specification, was expected to be completed by the middle of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Sun's Java universal programming language, the new  
standard is intended to help speed the development of networked 
consumer devices. By creating devices to a single specification, 
the manufacturers and software developers hope to make linking 
digital gizmos to computer networks as easy as plugging a telephone 
into a wall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each one of these applications had its own industry and  
working group and standard,'' said Eric Brown, an industry analyst 
with Forrester Research, based in Boston. ``It's becoming clear 
there's an opportunity to connect everything to everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other members of the group are Alcatel, Cable &AMP; Wireless,  
Electricite de France, Enron Communications, Ericsson, Lucent 
Technologies, Network Computer Inc., Nortel Networks, Oracle Corp., 
Philips Electronics, Sybase and Toshiba. 
</P>
<P>
	One noticeable no-show was Microsoft Corp., the largest maker of  
computer software which is pushing its dominant Windows as the 
operating system for future Internet gizmos. Microsoft's absence 
could hamper the widespread acceptance of a new standard from the 
group.

<HEADLINE> Ramon May Join Pedro With Red Sox </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- The Boston Red Sox have one thing no  
other team can offer free agent Ramon Martinez as he recovers from 
shoulder surgery: his brother Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the extent that Ramon wants to pitch with his brother, he's  
got to come here,'' Boston general manager Dan Duquette said with a 
laugh. ``That and several million dollars will sign the pitcher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox may not be too far away from doing that.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was pretty positive about maybe signing here,'' said Pedro,  
who spoke Saturday to Ramon, who was in the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Duquette said Monday he went to Santo Domingo two weeks ago to  
watch Ramon throw in his comeback from the operation that ended his 
11th season with Los Angeles after just 15 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	And while Duquette said three or four other teams may be in the  
running, ``we've had discussions all winter and I think there's a 
general understanding that Ramon does have some interest in 
pitching on the same team with his brother again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They were teammates with the Dodgers in 1993 when Pedro went  
10-5 as a rookie, while Ramon was 10-12. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the five seasons since then, Ramon is 61-28 and is coming  
off a career-best 2.83 ERA. And Pedro won the Cy Young award with 
Montreal in 1997 and was 19-7 with a 2.89 ERA with Boston last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's always been the No. 1 starter for the Dodgers since  
1990,'' Pedro said, ``so I guess I'd say we'll have two number one 
starters on one team. That would be a great acquisition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not so fast, said Duquette, although Ramon's already throwing  
off a mound and may be ready to continue his comeback by signing 
with a team. If it's the Red Sox, Duquette doesn't see him pitching 
in the majors before the second half of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's progressing and he was in good shape prior to the surgery  
so we are proceeding on the basis that he's eventually going to 
come back and be a decent major league pitcher,'' Duquette said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he were confident Ramon would sign with Boston,  
Duquette said, ``we're still working towards it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before he became Red Sox manager in 1997, Jimy Williams was a  
coach with Atlanta and watched the Braves face Ramon. 
</P>
<P>
	``He seemed to be in control of himself out there,'' Williams  
said. ``He had composure on that mound, didn't get rattled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his last five seasons, Martinez was 12-7, 17-7, 15-6, 10-5  
and 7-3 with ERAs of 3.97, 3.66, 3.42, 3.64 and 2.83. For his 
career, he has a .615 winning percentage and a 3.45 ERA. And he 
doesn't turn 31 until March 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Pedro, 27, would love to play with his brother.  
</P>
<P>
	``It would feel great. It would bring back a lot of memories  
about a lot of good moments that we had when we were in L.A.,'' 
Pedro said. ``I'll have my best friend'' as a teammate. 
</P>
<P>
	While both have been very successful, their personalities are  
different. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not a very outspoken person. He's very shy,'' Pedro said.  
``He's a cold-blooded man. I'm a little bit of a jumpy guy, 
aggressive. He's very poised and very quiet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he's not the only Martinez brother the Red Sox might be  
interested in reuniting with Pedro. Jesus, a 24-year-old lefty, was 
7-6 with a 6.85 ERA last season as a starter for Cincinnati's top 
farm team in Indianapolis, then underwent rotator cuff surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Pedro said Jesus has other offers and may have a better chance  
to pitch on a less settled staff than Boston's, which is stocked 
with reliable veterans. Duquette said he saw Jesus throw a couple 
of weeks ago, but he wouldn't necessarily be part of a package deal 
with Ramon. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're independent,'' Duquette said, ``but the brothers do  
have an interest in pitching together on the same ballclub. We've 
had discussions in regard to Jesus as well. He is available.''

<HEADLINE> Cambridge, Oxford Name Rowers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- North American oarsmen dominated the lineups today  
as Oxford and Cambridge universities named the eight-man crews 
contesting the 145th annual boat race, to be held April 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Cambridge University Boat Club president Brad Crombie, a  
Canadian, will lead the ``Light Blues'' in a bid for a seventh 
successive victory in the annual varsity challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Cambridge covered the 4 1/4 miles in 16 minutes, 19 seconds last  
year to break the race's record, set by Oxford in 1984, by 29 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Cambridge's crew will also contain former Yale student Josh  
West, who at 6-foot-9 becomes the tallest rower ever to compete in 
the annual contest, his former Harvard rival David Ellis and German 
international Tim Wooge. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oxford crew includes Americans Martin Crotty, a U.S.  
national champion and international oarsman in 1997 and '98, and 
Toby Ayer, who rowed in the Oxford reserve crew last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've rowed in the Yale-Harvard race but the public focus here  
is bigger than anything I've seen for a U.S. regatta,'' West said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 250,000 spectators are expected to line the banks of  
the Thames between the start at Putney Bridge in southwest London 
and the finish line at Mortlock.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Slide on Inflation Jitters / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices slid sharply Monday, lifting  
interest rates to another six-month high, as inflation jitters 
intensified with the latest in a series of strong economic reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 41/32  
point, or $12.81 1/4 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, rose to 5.66 percent, up from 5.57 
percent late Friday and its highest level since last August. 
</P>
<P>
	The steep downturn followed a new report showing that factory  
activity rose in February, halting an eight-month slump. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, the first broad reading on last month's economic  
activity, offered the first hint that U.S. factories were winning 
back some of the business they'd lost to the Asian economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	While good news for U.S. exporters, the data compounded worries  
that the Federal Reserve may boost its lending rates to slow the 
economy and protect against inflation. Rising interest rates hurt 
bonds by making their yields less competitive, while inflation 
makes fixed-income investments less attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market Monday, prices of short-term Treasury  
securities fell 3/32 point, while intermediate maturities fell 3/8 to 
11/16 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, fell 7.12 
points to 1,274.86. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 4.69 percent as the  
discount rose 0.02 percentage point from late Friday to 4.57 
percent. Six-month yields rose to 4.77 percent, as the discount 
rose 0.05 percentage point to 4.59 percent. One-year yields rose to 
4.71 percent, as the discount rose 0.03 percentage point to 4.66 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 5.25 percent from 4.88 percent late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 23/32 to 123 29/32. The average yield 
to maturity rose to 5.23 percent from 5.17 percent late Friday.

<HEADLINE> Group Urges No Cursing in Sports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Trash talk is as familiar to basketball  
fans as slam dunks. On the sidelines of NFL games, profanity is as 
much a fixture as Gatorade. 
</P>
<P>
	But it doesn't stop there. High school athletes -- and even those  
younger -- are cursing during games. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday is National Sportsmanship Day, and the group organizing  
the event wants to do something about all the crude talk. It is 
campaigning for players and coaches at about 12,000 schools in 101 
nations to pledge not to curse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a pretty big deal because most players do swear  
on the court and it just takes away from the game ... the 
enjoyment, the excitement,'' said Reginald Williams, a 17-year-old 
from North Carolina who plays basketball for the American Community 
School in Cobham, England. 
</P>
<P>
	The Institute for International Sport, a nonprofit group that  
promotes ethics and international friendship through sports, got 
the idea for the ``No Swear Zone'' pledge after doing a survey of 
top business and political leaders, said executive director Dan 
Doyle. 
</P>
<P>
	One Fortune 500 CEO called profanity in sports a major  
self-control problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no such thing as trash talking in corporate board  
rooms,'' he said in response to the survey, choosing to remain 
anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers from the institute, which is based in South  
Kingstown, R.I., concede they do not know whether profanity is in 
sports is on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
	One coach said profanity is not a factor of class, nationality  
or religion. Rather, she said, the popular culture reinforces the 
foul language. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the television they watch. It's the culture,'' said  
Barbara Hoegen, who coaches Williams and other varsity basketball 
players for the American Community School in Cobham. 
</P>
<P>
	The school attracts the children of well-paid expatriate  
professionals and business executives from around the world to its 
campus 30 minutes outside of London. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are from good families. We call it milk and honey land,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle concedes that pledging to not curse will do little to  
change the behavior, which often comes in uncontrolled outbursts. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who Hoegen says curses a lot, agrees. In the margin of  
the no-profanity pledge sheet, he noted that he would only ``try'' 
not to swear. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very passionate about basketball. If something goes wrong,  
I can't really say to my coach that I am not going to say something 
bad,'' Williams said. ``But I would definitely try to live up to my 
word,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle hopes a series of role-playing activities and discussion  
topics suggested to schools for National Sportsmanship Day will 
help change attitudes more than the pledge itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't do any good for someone to come up before a game  
and read the sportsmanship code,'' he said. ``What does good is for 
teams to really sit down and decide where they stand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In past years, National Sportsmanship Day has focused on deeper  
problems in sports, such as racism and violence.

<HEADLINE> Some Black Farmers Dislike Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Just hours before a federal judge was to give  
final review to a multimillion-dollar settlement between black 
farmers and the Agriculture Department, leaders of two farmer 
groups said Monday they have problems with the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers scheduled a rally Tuesday morning prior to a fairness  
hearing with U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman. Several farmers 
also planned to speak at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The farmers are having some real issues with what has been  
proposed,'' said Gary Grant, president of the Black Farmers and 
Agriculturists Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for both sides announced a settlement in January to  
the discrimination lawsuit brought by farmers two years ago because 
they were denied access to government loans and subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would allow farmers with less documented evidence to  
take a $50,000 tax-free payment and have their government debts 
forgiven. Farmers with more evidence could opt to go before an 
independent arbitrator and seek larger damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost of the settlement is unclear, because neither the  
number of farmers who will join the class nor settlement options 
they will choose is known. The cost could reach $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of the agreement, many farmers hailed the end of  
sometimes contentious negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	But now, many plaintiffs say that after reading the agreement  
they're not sure they are getting a fair deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The $50,000 payment ``does not compensate somebody who has lost  
their home, their farm, their credibility, their credit rating'' 
Grant said. 
</P>
<P>
	And farmers will have a hard time proving a preponderance of  
evidence to seek larger damages, Grant said. ``We're talking about 
elderly people who have little formal education, who operated in an 
atmosphere of racism and bigotry. People who did not necessarily 
file complaints,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel as though the burden of proof shouldn't be on the  
farmer,'' said John Boyd, president of the National Black Farmers 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the things farmers have mentioned including in the  
settlement are a review board to look over the arbitrator's rulings 
and the firing of department officials in the counties that 
participated in the discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	``We definitely want a settlement,'' Boyd said, ``but we want a  
settlement that's going to be fair to the black farmers who have 
been victims of the Department of Agriculture.''

<HEADLINE> 10-Year-Old Boy Allowed To Stay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUREL, Md. (AP) -- A 10-year-old boy who filed for bankruptcy  
last August to avoid eviction from his house can stay there without 
going through with the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	Shawn Powell's attorney says a judge dismissed the case in U.S.  
Bankruptcy Court in Greenbelt. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, there is no reason to keep the bankruptcy case  
open. It served its purpose of avoiding foreclosure,'' lawyer Brett 
Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss helped Powell file for protection under the bankruptcy  
code to prevent a mortgage company from foreclosing on the Laurel, 
Md. home where the boy and his 13-year-old brother, Ray Powell Jr. 
live with an uncle. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys' father, who had owned the house, died in February  
1998. Their mother died a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	By August, five monthly mortgage payments on the house had been  
missed and the mortgage company had moved to foreclose. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss hoped that in filing for bankruptcy they would buy enough  
time for the uncle, Jeffrey Powell, to become the legal guardian of 
the boys.The boys must have a legal guardian before they can 
collect on their father's $100,000 life insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The mortgage company has stopped its foreclosure effort, Weiss  
said, and a hearing on Jeffrey Powell's petition to become the 
boys' legal guardian is expected to be scheduled later this year in 
Prince George's County Circuit Court. The boys' half sister, Tasha 
Kelly, 19, has said she intends to fight to become their guardian.

<HEADLINE> New High-Tech Speakers Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- In a twist to the Victorian adage about  
well-behaved children, a British high-technology firm has developed 
a loudspeaker that can be heard, but not seen. 
</P>
<P>
	NXT PLC says its transparent speakers -- glass or plexiglass  
panels that emit sound through subtle vibrations -- rival 
conventional speakers in quality. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel speakers are much less bulky than conical speakers, so  
the new technology should allow for further miniaturization of 
electronic devices like laptop computers and televisions, the 
company says. 
</P>
<P>
	See-through speakers could, in theory, be as large as movie  
screens and small enough to fit on a business card. Refinements in 
the technology might even enable a car windshield to double as a 
stereo speaker. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can let your imagination run wild. You don't have to think  
of these oblong boxes,'' said Jon Vizor, NXT's marketing director. 
</P>
<P>
	NXT predicts that the first products containing transparent  
speakers could hit the market within 18 months. They are likely to 
be laptops, televisions and home-theater systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The transparent speakers are triggered by an electronic  
``exciter'' the size and shape of a quarter that is attached to the 
edge of the speaker panel. The exciter emits an impulse that causes 
the panel to vibrate, and the vibrations, which are invisible to 
the human eye, create sound waves. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike conventional loudspeakers, which contain a diaphragm that  
moves back and forth like a piston, different parts of the 
transparent speaker panel vibrate independently. The panel, or 
screen, ripples in a complex pattern that seems almost random. 
</P>
<P>
	Under close magnification, the speaker surface resembles a  
three-dimensional map of mountainous terrain, with each peak 
punching the air to help create sound waves. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like hundreds and hundreds of minuscule volcanoes  
erupting all over the screen,'' Vizor said. 
</P>
<P>
	NXT says its see-through speakers have a wider frequency than  
conventional ones, giving them a deeper bass and a less tinny 
sound. And they project sound in all directions at once, making it 
unnecessary, for example, that an audiophile face a stereo speaker 
to hear music at its clearest. 
</P>
<P>
	Headquartered in London, the 3-year-old company based its  
research on work its scientists originally did to reduce cockpit 
noise in jet aircraft for Britain's Defense Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Its quite a novel technology,'' says Matthew Alleyne, a  
technology reporter for the Electronics Times -- a London-based 
weekly newspaper that covers Britain's electronics industry. ``I 
would say it's fairly revolutionary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So revolutionary, in fact, that some electronics industry  
watchers aren't even aware of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's space-saving and weight-saving, that sounds like great  
stuff,'' said Tom Wills-Sandford of the Federation of the 
Electronics Industry, a British trade association. 
</P>
<P>
	NXT used similar technology to develop an opaque speaker panel  
two years ago. Some 90 firms, from NEC Corp. in Japan to Philips 
Electronics N.V. in the Netherlands, have paid for licenses to that 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Opaque panels are already available on a wide array of  
electronics goods, including personal computers and portable CD 
players. U.S. audio companies licensed for the technology include 
Harman International Industries Inc., maker of JBL and Infinity 
speakers, and Alpine Electronics Research Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Wharfedale International Ltd, a firm based in 60 miles north of  
London in Huntingdon, uses NXT's technology to make an opaque 
speaker camouflaged as a ceiling tile. 
</P>
<P>
	It also markets a speaker designed as a framed picture, for use  
in homes, hotels or restaurants. Customers can paint or decorate 
the white speaker panel however they like. 
</P>
<P>
	As for transparent speakers, Vizor says the technology for them  
is still so new that NXT has yet to start selling licenses for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Peerless Fabrikkerne A/S, a Danish company that makes the  
exciters for speakers using NXT's technology, is trying to develop 
its own type of transparent speakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Company president Nils Erik Kristensen, speaking from  
Copenhagen, acknowledged NXT's lead in the see-through technology 
race. But he suggested that competition in transparent speakers may 
not be far off. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly something that a lot of companies are looking  
at,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Duke Tops AP Men's Hoops Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Duke, which made school and conference history last weekend, was  
No. 1 in The Associated Press college basketball poll for the 
fourth straight week Monday, while No. 2 Michigan State reached its 
highest ranking in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils (29-1) capped the first 16-0 season in Atlantic  
Coast Conference history on Saturday with an 81-61 victory over 
North Carolina, extending their winning streak to a school-record 
24 games. For the second straight week Duke received all but one of 
the first-place votes from a national media panel, getting 71 and 
1,799 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State (26-4) again got the other No. 1 vote and had  
1,694 points to move from third to second, its highest ranking 
since being No. 1 for two weeks during the 1978-79 season. The 
Spartans, led by sophomore Magic Johnson, won their only national 
championship that season. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut moved up one place to third and Auburn, which lost  
at Arkansas last week, dropped two places to fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland and Stanford remained fifth and sixth and were followed  
by Cincinnati, Utah, Miami and St. John's. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah, which was 12th last week, is back in the top 10 for the  
first time since the first poll of the regular season. The return 
trip to the top 10 was a little longer for Miami, which was last 
there in the final poll of the 1959-60 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State dropped one spot to No. 11 and was followed by UCLA,  
Arizona, Kentucky, North Carolina, College of Charleston, Indiana, 
Tennessee, Wisconsin and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The last five teams were Florida, Arkansas, Minnesota, Missouri  
and New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	The next-to-last poll of the season had a sizable shakeup as 14  
ranked teams lost at least one game last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Four teams reentered the Top 25 this week -- Tennessee, Arkansas,  
Minnesota and Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee (20-7) came back in at No. 18 and on a six-game  
winning streak, the last of which was over Kentucky on Sunday. The 
Volunteers were ninth in the preseason poll but were gone by the 
fifth week of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas (20-9) returned at No. 22 after a three-week absence.  
The Razorbacks lost at Alabama on Saturday but had beaten Auburn 
and Kentucky in their previous two games. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota (17-9) was out of the Top 25 the last two weeks and  
returned at No. 23 having won three of four. Missouri (20-7) is 
ranked for the third time in the last five weeks, this time coming 
in off a road victory at Texas on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the four teams that fell out of the rankings had been in  
the Top 25 all season. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue (19-10), which had been as high as eighth this season,  
dropped out from 23rd following losses to Minnesota and Michigan 
State. Syracuse (19-10), which had been as high as No. 12, dropped 
out from 24th following Sunday's loss to Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	Temple (19-9), which was tied for 24th last week, fell out after  
one week back in the poll after losing to Massachusetts on Sunday. 
Texas (18-11) made its first poll appearance of the season last 
week at No. 22, but was gone after the loss to Missouri.

<HEADLINE> ABC Expecting Big Lewinsky Audience </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Anticipating a big audience for Barbara Walters'  
interview with Monica Lewinsky on Wednesday night, ABC is asking 
advertisers for five times what they normally would pay for a 
30-second commercial on ``20/20.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC also has begun running ``teaser'' ads, showing Walters  
throwing questions at Lewinsky but revealing none of her answers. 
</P>
<P>
	The network generally charges $160,000 for half-minute ads on  
regular editions of ``20/20.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two-hour Lewinsky interview, scheduled for 9 p.m. EST on  
Wednesday, is being categorized as a special, so ABC has hiked the 
price to about $800,000, said executives familiar with ad sales. 
Advertisers who had bought time months ago on ``20/20'' will either 
have to pay the new price or drop out. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, Fox charged advertisers a record $1.6 million to  
buy 30-second ads on the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the nation's biggest advertisers have said they weren't  
interested in hawking their products as the former White House 
intern talks about her affair with President Clinton. Procter &AMP; 
Gamble, whose products include Ivory soap, Tide detergent and Crest 
toothpaste, normally avoids news programs because of potentially 
controversial topics, spokeswoman Gretchen Briscoe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola also is steering clear of Lewinsky. ``It just doesn't  
seem like something that would be right for our brands,'' 
spokeswoman Kari Bjorhus said. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC's ad sales department is targeting movie studios and  
Internet companies, believing they're more willing to take a gamble 
on the material attracting a big audience, said Bob Flood of DeWitt 
Media, an advertising buying firm. 
</P>
<P>
	One analyst predicted a huge night in the ratings for ABC,  
estimating that 45 percent of the nation's televisions in use that 
night will be watching Lewinsky. ``ER,'' the year's top-ranked 
entertainment show, has an average audience share of 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are sick of it, without a doubt, but no one has had a  
chance to sit down and hear what she's had to say,'' said Marc 
Berman of the advertising firm Seltel. ``This is an event. People 
are going to watch it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Paul Schulman, who has his own advertising buying firm,  
predicts an audience share of between 25 and 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think now that it's over, I'm not sure that everyone even  
cares to hear from Monica,'' Schulman said. 
</P>
<P>
	When Oprah Winfrey interviewed Michael Jackson in 1993, the show  
drew a staggering 56 audience share, Nielsen Media Research said. 
Two years later, when Jackson was interviewed by Diane Sawyer, it 
had a 42 audience share. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ratings last week for its ``Dateline NBC'' interview with  
Juanita Broaddrick, who accused Bill Clinton of sexually assaulting 
her more than 20 years ago, were only slightly higher than a 
typical episode of the newsmagazine. It drew 15 percent of the 
available audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Because ABC only owns the domestic distribution rights to the  
interview, it won't be telecast on the Web, nor will the network 
make a full transcript available there. Instead, ABCnews.com will 
show some film clips online and show portions of the transcript, 
spokeswoman Michelle Bergman said.

<HEADLINE> Oriole Owner's Son Is Promoted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- With little fanfare, Baltimore  
Orioles owner Peter Angelos promoted his son, John, to be the 
club's executive vice president, making the 31-year-old one of the 
game's youngest high-ranking officials. 
</P>
<P>
	John Angelos is now the club's third-ranking official behind his  
father and chief operating officer Joe Foss, The (Baltimore) Sun 
reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Angelos is now in charge of day-to-day  
administrative operations, a role formerly held exclusively by 
Foss. 
</P>
<P>
	Foss is now free to assume a more strategic role, handling the  
team's dealings with Major League Baseball, its protracted search 
for a new spring training site and the owner's downtown hotel 
project. 
</P>
<P>
	John Angelos was the ``chairman's representative'' until last  
October, when his father asked that he assume a more active role. 
</P>
<P>
	Describing the move as a ``gradual transition,'' the Orioles  
opted not to issue a formal announcement regarding Angelos' 
position. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not that we're downplaying it; we don't think it's that  
much of an issue. I'm not that caught up in titles,'' John Angelos 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The older of Peter Angelos' two sons, John Angelos was  
previously involved in negotiations between the Orioles and its 
contractors and also worked part-time in ticketing, sales and 
ballpark operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelos' new role calls for him to deal directly with the heads  
of marketing, publishing, public relations, sales and ticketing.

<HEADLINE> White House To Attack Counsel Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reversing the Clinton administration's  
long-standing position, Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder plans 
to tell Congress Tuesday the independent counsel law is 
fundamentally flawed and should be allowed to expire in June, a 
senior administration official said Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Watergate-inspired law under attack from both Democrats  
and Republicans on Capitol Hill, Holder was to outline the 
administration's new position at a hearing Tuesday before a House 
judiciary subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	Holder planned to testify that a study group he chaired  
concluded that the Justice Department is capable of investigating 
and prosecuting most of the officials now covered by the law, the 
senior official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	In rare cases in which there is a genuine conflict of interest,  
the attorney general could use her long-standing statutory 
authority to hire a special counsel to conduct an investigation, 
Holder will say, according to the official. 
</P>
<P>
	Holder will cite the use of special counsels appointed by the  
attorney general in several scandals, including Teapot Dome and 
Watergate, as serving the country well, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition to the Independent Counsel Act directly reverses the  
Clinton administration's stance five years ago, when both the 
president and Attorney General Janet Reno successfully urged 
Congress to renew the law. 
</P>
<P>
	The new position was developed by the Justice Department task  
force and then cleared with the Office of Management and Budget and 
the White House as acceptable administration policy, the official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Support for the law among Republicans has been eroded by two  
events in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	They objected to the length of Lawrence Walsh's lengthy  
investigation of the Iran-Contra scandal during the Reagan and Bush 
administrations. 
</P>
<P>
	More recently, Republicans have groused about Reno's refusal to  
turn over to an independent counsel her department's investigation 
of campaign financing activities of Clinton, Vice President Al Gore 
and other Democrats in the 1996 election. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats have turned against the law because of what they view  
as excessive vigor by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr in 
investigating the Clintons' business dealings in Arkansas and the 
president's affair. Starr recommended Clinton's impeachment to the 
House last September. The Senate acquitted Clinton last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the Justice Department, officials have felt that some of  
the record seven independent counsels sought by Reno over the past 
six years overreached and exceeded their intended mandates. 
</P>
<P>
	The law requires the attorney general to seek an independent  
counsel when there is substantial and credible evidence of a crime 
by any one of 49 top federal officials, including the president. 
</P>
<P>
	A special panel of three federal judges then picks an attorney  
for the job, and the independent prosecutor is given an unlimited 
budget to hire aides and conduct an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno is scheduled to testify on the issue later this month  
before the Senate Government Affairs Committee.

<HEADLINE> Cross-Burning Convictions Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today left intact the  
cross-burning convictions and prison sentences of three North 
Carolina men who tried to intimidate their neighbors, an 
interracial couple. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, without comment, turned away arguments that a federal  
anti-arson law wrongly was used to add five years to each man's 
prison term, and that the convictions violated their free-speech 
rights. A federal appeals court previously had rejected those 
arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfred and Eugene Smith and Martin King lived in rural Haywood,  
N.C., across the street from Gordon Cullins, who is black, and 
Hazel Sutton, who is white. 
</P>
<P>
	Unhappy about a mixed-race couple in the neighborhood, the three  
men decided to burn crosses on their neighbors' front lawn on New 
Year's Eve 1992. When Cullins and Ms. Sutton returned home, they 
saw smoldering crosses on their lawn and heard racial slurs yelled 
by the three men. 
</P>
<P>
	King and the Smiths were indicted in 1996 and charged with  
conspiring to violate their neighbors' civil rights, intimidation 
and use of fire during a felony. 
</P>
<P>
	Their conviction on the last charge added five years to each  
man's sentence. In all, King was sentenced to six years in prison; 
Alfred Smith to six years and nine months; and Eugene Smith to 15 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeals acted on today, lawyers for the three argued that  
the anti-arson law should not have been used in connection with an 
illegal conspiracy because the crime -- conspiring -- occurred 
without use of fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals also contended that use of anti-arson law violated  
free-speech rights because of ``the expressive conduct conveyed in 
cross-burning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyers urged the court to reject the  
appeals, contending that the cross burning furthered the illegal 
conspiracy. Because the men could not have achieved the object of 
their agreement without igniting the crosses, the government 
lawyers said, ``they used fire to commit the underlying civil 
rights violations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government lawyers also said the free-speech claims had no  
merit. ``It is well established that the First Amendment does not 
protect threats and intimidation,'' they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases are King vs. U.S., 98-1024, and Smith vs. U.S.,  
98-6523.

<HEADLINE> Maggert Full of Surprises in Match  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                            *Golf Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- In the strongest field ever assembled  
for match play, no one expected Jeff Maggert to be the player who 
could make it through five days, six matches and 127 holes of golf 
and walk away with $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Not even his 10-year-old son.  
</P>
<P>
	Having taken his first big scalp with a one-birdie, no-bogey,  
1-up victory over Nick Price in the second round, Maggert called 
his son in Houston and laid out the scenario: If he were to win his 
morning match over Berhnard Langer, he might get to play Tiger 
Woods in the quarterfinals that afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, no,'' his son told him. ``You can't beat Tiger Woods.''  
</P>
<P>
	In a week that didn't pan out the way anyone expected at La  
Costa Resort, Maggert was full of surprises. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest of all was that he won, something he had not done in  
over five years. 
</P>
<P>
	His victims included Price, Langer and Woods, who have combined  
to win six major championships and 100 tournaments around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	If that wasn't enough, he brought the first World Golf  
Championship event to a sudden, stunning conclusion by chipping in 
from 20 feet on the 38th hole to defeat Andrew Magee and win the 
richest prize in tour history. 
</P>
<P>
	``My son has been giving me a hard time about finishing  
second,'' Maggert said. ``But he's been an inspiration to me the 
last few years, because he does get on me. It's not, 'Oh, Dad, I'm 
sorry you finished second.' It's, 'Dad, how come you can't win?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Maggert was beginning to wonder that himself.  
</P>
<P>
	His only victory was the 1993 Disney Classic, which he actually  
won at night because tournament officials had to set up floodlights 
to beat the darkness. He blew third-round leads on Sunday by 
shooting 78, got blown by in the final round last year when David 
Duval posted a 64 in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1993, he has finished second 13 times, more than anyone  
else on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``To talk to the press, it was almost like a tape recording to  
me,'' Maggert said. ``I knew what I was going to say before I even 
came in. But I knew inside of myself that I had what it took to win 
golf tournaments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And as he showed this week, he has what it takes to win in match  
play. 
</P>
<P>
	No, he's not a power hitter like Woods or Duval. Maggert was  
52nd in driving distance in 1994 and has gotten worse each year, 
tumbling to 143rd last year. 
</P>
<P>
	He couldn't be considered a clutch player, not with all those  
second-place finishes. 
</P>
<P>
	He is far from intimidating, a 35-year-old who smiles about as  
often as the sun shines in Pebble Beach the first week in February. 
</P>
<P>
	But behind the plaid look is a colorful pattern of match-play  
success. He is 3-2 in two Ryder Cup appearances, including a 3 and 
2 victory over Lee Westwood in Valderrama, and has won Diner Club 
Matches with two players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the biggest thing about my golf game is I don't give  
away holes, and I feel like I'm a good pressure player,'' Maggert 
said. ``I drive the ball straight. I hit a lot of fairways. I think 
that's very important in match play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most important ingredient is patience, which Maggert  
displayed during his five-year hiatus from the winner's circle. And 
he was not in short supply of it this week. 
</P>
<P>
	He came from behind in five of his six matches, and was  
particularly strong from the quarterfinals on. He trailed Woods by 
two holes after seven, caught him with two birdies and then took 
the lead with a 40-foot eagle putt. He was three down to Steve Pate 
in the semifinals with seven to play when he made another run to 
advance 1-up. 
</P>
<P>
	Against Magee in the 36-hole finals, he didn't lead a hole from  
the time he walked off the fourth green in the morning until Magee 
congratulated him on the 38th hole as the sun was setting over the 
foothills north of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	By that time, Woods, Duval, Ernie Els, Davis Love III, Mark  
O'Meara and all the other players ranked in the top 20 were long 
gone. Woods was the only player in the top 10 who advanced to the 
quarterfinals, leaving ABC Sports with a weekend of tour grinders 
in their mid-30s. 
</P>
<P>
	Maggert offered no apologies.  
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, this is probably the biggest win of my career,'' he  
said. ``You've got the top 64 guys in the world playing, and match 
play is a very difficult format to win. This is not an easy week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When it was over, Maggert left the interview room with a  
cellular phone to his ear, perhaps giving his son the same message 
he had when he walked into the interview room Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't have to ask me what it feels like to finish  
second,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Faulted on Land Mine Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Activists seeking to pressure the Clinton  
administration into joining an international ban on land mines 
gathered at the White House and on Capitol Hill Monday to protest 
the U.S. refusal to sign the 133-nation accord on the day it went 
into effect. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States fails in moral leadership,'' said Sen.  
Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., author of a bill designed to pressure the 
administration into submitting the treaty to the Senate for 
ratification. His bill would bar the production of land mines in 
the United States and cut off funds for their deployment after 
2003. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has agreed to stop using land mines  
everywhere except South Korea by 2003. The Pentagon says it needs 
mines to help protect U.S. troops stationed there against a land 
invasion by North Korea across the Demilitarized Zone. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of land-mine survivors, most missing a limb, a hand or a  
foot, protested the U.S. position at a rally in front of the White 
House and at a news conference on Capitol Hill. Elsewhere, bells 
were run in over 200 churches in 25 states at noon in support of 
the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Miles, a former Army captain who lost both legs in Vietnam in  
1969 when he stepped on a land mine, said the weapon ``has outlived 
its usefulness, whatever usefulness it ever had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I despise them. As a soldier, I expected to take punishment,  
but that's too much,'' said Fred Downs Jr., who lost a limb in 
Vietnam in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry White, who lost his lower right leg as a college student  
on a camping trip in Israel in 1984, called for an ``immediate ban 
on this indiscriminate weapon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty, reached in Ottawa, Canada, in 1997, bans the use,  
stockpiling, production and sale of antipersonnel mines. So far, 
it's been signed by 133 nations and ratified by 65. 
</P>
<P>
	However, major users and producers -- including the United  
States, Russia and China -- have refused to join in. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has set 2006 as a target for fully joining the accord.  
</P>
<P>
	But Leahy said the United States should not wait. ``This is a  
global problem that cries out for U.S. leadership,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``President Clinton deserves credit for taking some steps to  
move the policy of his administration. There has been progress. But 
the response has been slow and it has been grudging and it has 
fallen far short of what is needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to banning the manufacture of land miles and their  
use after 2003, Leahy's bill would also assist governments with 
carrying out terms of the treaty, including destroying mine 
stockpiles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are the only nation in the world who has the military,  
economic and moral influence to enforce such a ban,'' said Rep. 
Jack Quinn, R-N.Y., the bill's House sponsor.

<HEADLINE> GAO, Pentagon Differ on Barracks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional auditors have concluded that it  
would not cost the military any more money to house male and female 
recruits in separate barracks. 
</P>
<P>
	After examining Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps training  
facilities around the country, the General Accounting Office said 
in a report Monday that the military is generally complying with a 
law to house men and women separately in basic training. 
</P>
<P>
	But often, the auditors said, compliance is obtained by creating  
separated quarters in the same barracks. The Pentagon contends that 
building new barracks to completely house men and women apart would 
cost $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO report concludes it wouldn't cost anything and that any  
construction over the next five years would be to house additional 
recruits, not because they have to be separated by gender. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army put the price tag at $271 million to provide separate  
barracks buildings for female recruits and the Navy's estimated $32 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force estimated that although it did not have to add  
barracks to make the change, it would have to halt planned 
renovations and incur some added cost in operating another building 
at its only basic training site, Lackland Air Force Base, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Solis, the GAO's assistant director, said the Pentagon  
estimates are based on the idea of leaving large parts of barracks 
unused. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're saying you could probably move another troop or company  
of men into that bottom floor they would just leave vacant,'' he 
said. The GAO plan may not be ``what they would like to do,'' Solis 
said, ``but at the same time, we can't see where you would just 
leave 30 buildings basically vacant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen announced last June that men and  
women would continue to train together at boot camp throughout most 
of the military, but will have to sleep in separate quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	A law passed last year requires the services to provide separate  
and secure housing for male and female recruits with separate 
entrances and with sleeping and latrine areas separated by 
permanent walls. 
</P>
<P>
	The military wants to maintain some flexibility in how it does  
that and objects to being required to designate separate buildings 
for men and women. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army, Navy and Air Force have chosen to conduct combined  
training with separate quarters but often in the same barracks so 
they can keep training units together. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a different course, the Marine Corps has separate  
training for men and women with generally separate barracks at its 
only training facility, Parris Island, S.C. Only one unit has men 
and women in the same building, but the women's bay is separated by 
alarmed doors and a security watch whenever it is occupied. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy trains all of its recruits at Great Lakes Naval Recruit  
Training Command in Illinois. The Army uses Fort McClellan, Ala., 
to conduct gender-integrated training but plans to move that 
function to Fort Leonard Wood, Mo., this summer. It also uses Fort 
Jackson, S.C., for gender-integrated training and plans to use Fort 
Sill, Okla., beginning in May.

<HEADLINE> Cepeda, Maz Hope Hall Calls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Orlando Cepeda earned his reputation with a bat.  
Bill Mazeroski was known for his Gold Glove -- and one big swing. 
</P>
<P>
	In their own ways, both players put up impressive numbers during  
17-year careers. On Tuesday, they'll find out whether those add up 
to a place in the Hall of Fame, although only one of them can be 
elected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm beginning to get very nervous,'' Cepeda said last week  
from his California home. ``I've been waiting so long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former outfielder Dom DiMaggio, manager Dick Williams and  
umpires Doug Harvey and Nestor Chylak also will be considered when 
the Veterans Committee holds its annual election in Tampa, Fla. 
Results are to be announced at 2 p.m. EST. 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Williams, Stan Musial and Yogi Berra are on the panel, down  
to 12 members this year from its normal 15. It will take 75 percent 
-- nine votes -- for election. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vets can pick up to four new Hall of Famers, one from each  
of four categories. The categories are: former major leaguers, 
Negro leaguers, 19th century players and personnel, plus a 
composite of managers, umpires, executives and Negro leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
	Turn-of-the-century manager Frank Selee and Negro leagues stars  
Smokey Joe Williams, Biz Mackey and Turkey Stearnes each attracted 
attention in last year's vote. The committee chose Larry Doby, Lee 
MacPhail, ``Bullet'' Joe Rogan and ``Gorgeous'' George Davis last 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	Induction ceremonies will be held July 25 at Cooperstown, N.Y.  
Nolan Ryan, George Brett and Robin Yount were elected in January by 
the Baseball Writers' Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda was the NL's rookie of the year in 1958 with San  
Francisco and the league's first unanimous MVP in 1967 with St. 
Louis. Nicknamed the Baby Bull and Cha-Cha, he hit .297 with 379 
home runs and 1,365 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda, 61, missed by just seven votes in the BBWAA election  
five years ago, his final try with the writers. He came close last 
year in voting by the Veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope this time I make it,'' said Cepeda, a community  
relations representative for the Giants. ``It would be the highest 
thing. It's hard to describe how much it would mean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mazeroski batted just .260 with 138 homers and 853 RBIs for  
Pittsburgh, but hit one of the most famous home runs ever -- a 
bottom-of-the-ninth shot in Game 7 of the 1960 World Series to beat 
the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazeroski made his mark in the field, winning eight Gold Gloves  
and taking part in 1,706 double plays, most in history among major 
league second basemen. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they consider defense, I got a chance,'' said Mazeroski,  
now 62 and working for the Pirates as a spring training instructor. 
``But if they don't, I don't have a chance at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio, at 82 the younger brother of Joe, hit .298 in 11  
seasons for the Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda, Mazeroski and DiMaggio all have strong supporters on the  
panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda is endorsed by former Giants teammate Juan Marichal and  
Mazeroski is boosted his former Pirates general manager, committee 
chairman Joe Brown. DiMaggio is supported by Ted Williams, his 
fellow outfielder on the Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	The Veterans panel is down to 12 because of the retirement of  
longtime executive Buzzie Bavasi and the health of writer Leonard 
Koppett and Hall of Fame shortstop Pee Wee Reese. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda did not get much support from the BBWAA when he first  
appeared on the ballot in 1978. Many felt his airport arrest on 
charges of trying to pick up 160 pounds of marijuana in 1975 -- for 
which he was sentenced to five years in jail and served 10 months -- 
hurt his bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe what happened to me in the past is all forgotten,''  
Cepeda said. 
</P>
<P>
	His son, an Adidas representative who was at the Yankees' spring  
training camp in Tampa last week, hopes this will be Cepeda's lucky 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``At one time, through my dad's trouble, it gets to the point  
like, `I don't want to hear it, I'm tired of baseball,''' said 
31-year-old Orlando Jr. ``As my dad has been getting older and 
getting more involved in baseball, it's a more special time now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Williams, a special adviser to the Yankees, has gotten  
support in the past. He was 1,571-1,451 (.520) with Boston, 
Oakland, California, Montreal, San Diego and Seattle and went to 
four World Series, winning two of them.

<HEADLINE> Brits Love 'Shakespeare in Love' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- There's no doubt the British love their Bard:  
``Shakespeare In Love'' dominated the nominations Monday for the 
51st British Academy of Film and Television Arts awards, earning 15 
citations. 
</P>
<P>
	The nominations include best picture, best director for John  
Madden, best actor for Joseph Fiennes, and best actress for Gwyneth 
Paltrow. 
</P>
<P>
	The romantic comedy -- which is up for 13 Oscar nominations as  
well -- competes for best film against another period saga, the far 
more grim and violent ``Elizabeth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Elizabeth,'' starring Australian actress Cate Blanchett, is up  
for 12 awards, called ``Baftas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The winners will be announced April 11.  
</P>
<P>
	Oscar front-runner ``Saving Private Ryan'' is competing for 10  
Baftas, including best picture, best director for Steven Spielberg, 
and best actor for Tom Hanks. 
</P>
<P>
	Others in the race for best picture include by director Peter  
Weir's darkly satiric ``The Truman Show,'' which was unexpectedly 
shut out of the Oscar race for the top prize. 
</P>
<P>
	``Little Voice'' stars Jane Horrocks and Michael Caine were  
nominated for best actress and best actor despite being neglected 
in the Oscar line-up. Oscar nominee Brenda Blethyn was also up for 
a Bafta award for her supporting performance in the same film. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynn Redgrave was a nominee for best supporting actress for  
``Gods and Monsters,'' but the film's leading man -- Oscar nominee 
Sir Ian McKellen -- was not named. 
</P>
<P>
	Doubling his chances of winning, Australian actor Geoffrey Rush  
will compete against himself in the category of supporting actor, 
having been nominated for his performances in both ``Elizabeth'' 
and ``Shakespeare In Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In some ways, the tightest Bafta race is for outstanding British  
film of the year. The six nominees in that category are 
``Elizabeth,'' ``Hilary and Jackie,'' ``Little Voice,'' ``My Name 
Is Joe,'' ``Sliding Doors,'' and ``Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking 
Barrels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Emily Watson is a best actress nominee for her anguished  
portrayal of cellist Jacqueline du Pre in the controversial 
``Hilary and Jackie.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bush May Announce Committee Tuesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush is expected to  
reveal his plans Tuesday to form an exploratory committee for 
seeking the Republican presidential nomination, according to an 
adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	The adviser, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Monday  
that Bush was planning a Tuesday afternoon briefing for Texas news 
reporters. Bush's wife, Laura, also would attend, the adviser said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has long promised his home state's news media he would tell  
them his intentions first. The adviser said he is ready to say he 
wants to form a committee that can raise and spend money while he 
tests the presidential waters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican governor mentioned the news briefing while  
dedicating a bridge in San Saba County in West Texas on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	While declining to reveal his decision, Bush later told  
reporters in Austin, ``Stay tuned. Something will be happening 
pretty soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was other evidence Monday of a Bush presidential  
candidacy. A key GOP fund-raiser among grass-roots conservatives 
signed on and state legislators from North Carolina, South Carolina 
and Connecticut had lunch with the governor, urging him to run. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Oliver, who raised nearly $3 million last year for Missouri  
Sen. John Ashcroft, is already here working for Bush and will 
become finance director of the campaign if the governor gets into 
the race, a Bush ally said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a supporter of the governor, and he's offered to help,  
and he's down here to help out, contingent on an announcement about 
a decision regarding an exploratory committee,'' Bush spokeswoman 
Mindy Tucker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush did not tell the state lawmakers he would make the race.  
But Patrick Ballantine, GOP leader of the North Carolina Senate 
said after the meeting, ``My gut feeling is that he is going to 
run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Wilkins, speaker of the South Carolina House, gave Bush a  
letter signed by 59 of the state's 66 Republican House members 
urging him to run. Wilkins said Bush's message of ``compassionate 
conservatism'' and his electoral success in Texas make him a 
candidate who can reclaim the White House for the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut House GOP leader Bob Ward said 90 percent of the  
Republican legislators in his state had signed a letter asking Bush 
to run. 
</P>
<P>
	As director of Ashcroft's fund-raising committee, Oliver built  
an impressive mailing list of more than 120,000 donors from the 
freshman senator's conservative base. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashcroft's performance was considered one of the strongest among  
those who have dropped out of White House contention. In an 
interview Monday, the senator said Oliver developed strong ties to 
conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly fair to say Jack is familiar with that  
community, and there are certainly people in that community who 
have a high degree of comfort with Jack,'' Ashcroft said. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Cape Girardeau, Mo., Oliver was Ashcroft's finance  
director in his 1994 Senate race and has worked and campaigned for 
a long line of Missouri Republican politicians.

<HEADLINE> Wall St. Stocks End Higher / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors swapped technology shares for those of  
financial and manufacturing concerns today, propelling the Dow 
Jones industrials out of a morning loss but leaving the broader 
indexes nearly flat. 
</P>
<P>
	According to preliminary calculations, the Dow Jones industrial  
average rose 18.20 to 9,324.78,. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 2.17 at 1,236.16, but the  
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 7.15 to 2,295.18. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 8-to-7 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,410 up, 1,608 down and 538 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 690.63 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
762.90 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 1.03 to 585.43 , and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was unchanged at 698.29. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.13 to 394.39.  
</P>
<P>
	While investors continued last week's strategy of jettisoning of  
technology issues, they picked more aggressively today at the 
shares of large financial and smokestack companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in a tug-of-war between those who think the market is  
overvalued, and bargain hunters who want to buy it at every dip,'' 
said Ricky Harrington, a technical analyst at Interstate/Johnson 
Lane in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow was led higher by Caterpillar, up 3 5/8 at 49 3/16 and  
Citigroup, up 2 1/2 at 61 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial stocks benefited as long-term interest rates rose  
faster than short-term rates, lowering financial companies' cost of 
funds while at the same time raising lending rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Cyclical stocks like Caterpillar rose on the perception that  
economic growth is still strong, a position confirmed by data 
released today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported that Americans' personal  
incomes increased a robust 0.6 percent in January. The report 
suggested that Americans entered 1999 with enough spending power to 
keep the economic expansion going. Spending rose moderately, up 0.3 
percent, suggesting that Americans might be saving a little more 
and be willing to put them into mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the National Association of Purchasing Management  
reported its index of purchasing activity rose to 52.4 percent in 
February from 49.5 percent in January. Any reading over 50 means 
the economy is expanding. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the bond market, both reports prolonged last week's worry  
that the economy is growing fast enough to spark inflation, and 
could prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten short-term interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bond market boys are nervous; they're totally freaked,''  
said Barry Hyman, senior equity analyst at Ehrenkrantz King 
Nussbaum. ``The bond market is acting like there's an interest rate 
hike coming at the (Fed's) March meeting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year Treasury bond was down 1 5/8, pushing its yield up to  
5.67 percent from 5.57 percent late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer stocks had their own problems. Intel fell after  
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Securities downgraded the 
semiconductor maker's stock to ``market perform'' from ``buy,'' 
saying March personal-computer sales won't grow as previously 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	And IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems fell after Lehman  
Brothers lowered its earnings projections for those companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by nearly 5 to 4 on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume was moderate and below 
Friday's pace.

<HEADLINE> Wahoo Waits for Letterman To Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WAHOO, Neb. (AP) -- Every night people here huddle at their  
television sets to watch ``The Late Show with David Letterman'' as 
if a neighbor were making an appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	They listen carefully when Letterman shuffles his stack of blue  
cards, gives his whimsical, gap-toothed grin and begins to 
introduce his Top Ten List. 
</P>
<P>
	They wait to hear him say a two-syllable word that most other  
people would liken to a cowboy's yell: Wahoo! 
</P>
<P>
	``We watch to just make sure Dave keeps us in mind,'' said Jane  
Daufeldt, director of the Wahoo Chamber of Commerce. ``We love to 
hear our town mentioned on national television every night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wahoo is the site of Letterman's fictional home office. It has  
held that distinction for two years, nine months -- longer than any 
of the 11 other home offices to which Letterman has referred in his 
17 years on television. 
</P>
<P>
	The farm town of 3,700 people about 25 miles from both Omaha and  
Lincoln (both former Letterman home offices) landed the home office 
by buying off Letterman in May 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``It all started when one night Dave exclaimed `Wahoo!' and  
asked if more people say yahoo or wahoo,'' Mayor Phyllis Nozicka 
recalled. ``We responded by letting him know there was really a 
place by that name.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The town ousted then-home office Grand Rapids, Mich., by  
flooding Letterman with bribes such as a Ford Pinto with a couch 
taped on its hood, homemade enchiladas, a cow-pie clock and a 
wedding gown large enough to fit two people. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor even made Letterman an admiral in the landlocked  
state's fictional navy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just like saying Wahoo,'' said Late Show executive producer  
Rob Burnett. ``We love Wahoo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason we landed there is that we got some great tax  
credits from the community and the overhead costs were lower,'' 
Burnett joked. ``It was really a sheer business decision from our 
end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Letterman fans from as far away as Germany have flocked to Wahoo  
to see the home office. Many are disappointed to discover it's just 
a phone booth on a downtown street corner. 
</P>
<P>
	No Late Show staff. No Dave. Not even his mother.  
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever someone calls asking for Dave, I say he just stepped  
out,'' said Helen Sloup, who has sold more than 3,000 Letterman 
T-shirts and bumper stickers at her son's Warehouse Surplus general 
store across the street. 
</P>
<P>
	During Letterman's 17 years as a talkshow host, 12 towns and  
cities have served as his show's fictional home office. Three are 
in Nebraska, distinguishing it as the state with the most home 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
	When the show was ``Late Night with David Letterman'' on NBC,  
the home office was variously in Milwaukee; Lebanon, Pa.; Lincoln, 
Neb.; Oklahoma City; Omaha, Neb.; Scottsdale, Ariz.; Tahlequah, 
Okla.; New York City, and Oneonta, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	During Letterman's CBS years, Sioux City, Iowa, had the honor,  
then Grand Rapids, Mich., and, since May 3, 1996, Wahoo. 
</P>
<P>
	Letterman has not visited Wahoo, but not for a lack of an  
invitation. 
</P>
<P>
	The city has asked him to come dozens of times. The former mayor  
offered to pick him up at the airport in a limousine or a John 
Deere combine. The Super 8 Motel offered him a complimentary suite. 
The Warehouse Surplus has tried to tantalize the cigar-loving 
Letterman with free stogies. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he came I'd offer him one of our $6.99 cigars, not a  
75-cent one,'' Mrs. Sloup said. ``I'd spend some bucks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Letterman has no immediate plans to visit, his famous  
stage director, Biff Henderson, may come soon as part of a show 
feature visiting small towns across the country, Burnett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wahoo residents said they just don't want to be forgotten.  
Letterman hasn't mentioned his home office much on the air lately. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they want to hear Dave say Wahoo more, I think the free  
stuff needs to continue trickling in,'' Burnett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Letterman no longer gets many bribes from Wahoo other than a  
free subscription to the Wahoo Newspaper (Letterman's Web site is 
called The Wahoo Gazette) and an occasional shipment of Wahoo 
Weiners (made at the OK Meat Market). 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the dwindling gifts, Burnett said Letterman has no plans  
to move his home office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dave at any moment can move the home office, but he feels  
comfortable that the people of Wahoo are doing a good job,'' 
Burnett said.

<HEADLINE> FDA Says MS Drug Cannot Be Sold Yet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A company's unusual lobbying campaign to win  
government approval for a new multiple sclerosis drug stalled 
Monday as the Food and Drug Administration rejected the immediate 
sale of Rebif. 
</P>
<P>
	Serono Laboratories had urged MS patients, doctors and members  
of Congress to plead with the FDA to approve Rebif. It even 
advertised in medical journals and Internet sites that Rebif was 
the best treatment, triggering an FDA investigation of Serono for 
illegally promoting an experimental drug. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem: Rebif's active ingredient is the exact same  
chemical already sold under another brand name, Avonex. The 
chemical is an immune system protein called interferon beta-1a. 
</P>
<P>
	Drugs containing the same chemical usually aren't an issue --  
lots of identical drugs sell in competition with each other. 
</P>
<P>
	But Avonex was approved under a special law called the Orphan  
Drug Act, which provides a big financial incentive for companies to 
develop drugs for rare diseases like MS: seven years of marketing 
protection against similar competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Avonex's special marketing protection doesn't expire until 2003.  
Under the law, Serono could only sell Rebif before then if it 
proves that Rebif is a better drug for at least some MS patients. 
But the FDA decided Monday that Serono has not yet proved that 
extra benefit, meaning that for now it cannot sell Rebif.

<HEADLINE> Lockheed Workers May Walk Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) -- Lockheed Martin could face a walkout this  
weekend at its Marietta plant, union officials said after an 
overwhelming vote for a strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of Local Lodge 709 of the International Association of  
Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which represents 4,300 employees 
of the aircraft manufacturer, said 89 percent called for a walkout 
in voting Sunday. The rank and file also rejected a negotiated 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	A company spokeswoman said today that Lockheed Martin is willing  
to try new talks with the union leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're willing to sit down with the union and see what they  
have to say about,'' spokeswoman Susan Miles said. ``We're 
disappointed the employees didn't ratify the agreement. We 
negotiated in good faith for more than two months and there was a 
lot of give and take on both sides.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The union was to present the strike vote and a five-day strike  
notice to the company today.

<HEADLINE> Web Site Helps Korean War Vets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Growing up in Philadelphia in the 1960s, Susan  
Burgess sometimes found herself in the attic with a family 
scrapbook and a child's curiosity. She wondered at the newspaper 
clippings about her Uncle Donald, an Air Force pilot who died in a 
prisoner-of-war camp in North Korea on a summer morning in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
	The family never learned the full story of Donald S. Sirman's  
death, never fully came to grips with the loss. The only remnant of 
him sent home was a small pocket Bible with Sirman's name on the 
front cover. ``He was the golden boy of the family,'' Ms. Burgess 
says, but she knew precious little about him. 
</P>
<P>
	Then last fall she discovered an Internet site called the Korean  
War Project. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Korean War Project put me in touch with people who helped  
me learn more about my Uncle Donald in a week than I knew in my 
entire lifetime,'' Ms. Burgess, 40, wrote in an e-mail response to 
an informal Associated Press survey of users of the Internet site, 
which gets about 1 million visitors a month. She described these 
revelations -- including conversations with men who knew her uncle 
and remembered the Bible he had shared with fellow prisoners at 
great risk to himself -- as ``one of the most remarkable events of 
my life.'' She also learned of the merciless marches to POW camps 
her uncle and other captives endured and details of his murder by a 
prison guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Burgess and a growing number of war veterans and their  
relatives are turning to the Internet as a way of rediscovering -- 
and in some cases realizing for the first time -- the meaning of the 
sacrifices made in combat, whether on the battlefields of Europe, 
Korea or Vietnam or in other lesser-known conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 33,000 American troops were killed in the three-year  
Korean War, which ended in 1953. Many fell in what is still 
communist North Korea, and about 8,000 men remain missing. The 
Korean War Project has created a human link to that traumatic, 
little understood period of Cold War history. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Burgess and untold numbers of other devotees of the Korean  
War Project are worried, however, that it may be forced offline for 
lack of financial support. The site's founders and sole operators, 
brothers Hal and Ted Barker of Dallas, say that after four years of 
sinking their own money into the Korean War Project, their 
self-described cyberspace obsession is on the brink of collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just have to go back to making a living,'' Hal Barker, 51,  
said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The Barker brothers' father, Edward L. Barker, of Crockett,  
Texas, was a Marine Corps helicopter pilot and Korean War hero. He 
was awarded a Silver Star for his role in a failed attempt to 
rescue a downed American airman in October 1951 on Heartbreak 
Ridge. The Korean War Project is dedicated to the memory of that 
lost airman, Marine Corps 2nd Lt. Arthur Donald DeLacy, of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Barkers have built an Internet resource that is a forum for  
communication among people interested in the war, but it also 
offers reference materials such as a database of men listed as 
killed in action and missing in action, and it is helping to fill 
gaps in official information about missing POWs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korean War Project also has given veterans and their loved  
ones a renewed pride, a sense of value in the painful memories from 
their long-forgotten war, a conflict that took a terrible toll on 
this country. 
</P>
<P>
	George F. Drake, of Bellingham, Wash., says the Korean War  
Project is a labor of love for the Barker brothers and a virtual 
outlet for the long-buried emotions of veterans traumatized by the 
war. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their labor is of significance to veterans such as I who use  
the project to `go back' to Korea via their Web page and come out 
of it again a bit healthier for having had this contact with 
memories good or bad,'' wrote Drake, who served in a radio 
intelligence unit in Korea during the war's final two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan Curran, of Diamond Bar, Calif., was 3 years old when her  
father, Navy Lt. Charles Garrison, was shot down over North Korea 
in May 1951 and never heard from again. She used the Korean War 
Project to find the person who last saw ``Snapper'' Garrison alive 
in a prisoner-of-war camp. She has collected enough other 
information to hold out hope that his remains might be unearthed 
and returned home. 
</P>
<P>
	For Gail Morris, of San Anselmo, Calif., the Korean War Project  
brought a moment of exhilaration when she received an e-mail 
message from a Scottsdale, Ariz., man who had flown fighter 
missions with her father, Air Force Maj. Thomas Ellis Myers, and 
remembered poignant moments they had shared. 
</P>
<P>
	He told her, for example, of being with Myers when he received  
the announcement of Ms. Morris's birth. Five months later he was 
shot down in his F-80, captured and imprisoned. He never made it 
home and never saw his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't tell you how happy I am'' to have learned details for  
the first time of his wartime experiences, she said in an 
interview. ``I had always had this cloud hanging over me, never 
knowing.''

<HEADLINE>  Thousands Take Cover in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIRYAT SHMONA, Israel (AP) -- Fearing a second round of fighting  
between Israel and Lebanese guerrillas, tens of thousands of 
civilians took cover on both sides of the border today. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called for restraint after  
Israel on Sunday made some of its biggest airstrikes in years 
against Hezbollah in response for attacks that killed an Israeli 
general and six other soldiers in southern Lebanon in the past 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	In Jerusalem, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu briefed senior  
ministers on the situation and told them ``the army is poised to 
continue to fight against terrorist forces in Lebanon,'' according 
to a Cabinet statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement did not specify if more airstrikes were to follow.  
But Israeli sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it 
appeared there would not be an escalation unless Hezbollah fired 
Katyusha rockets into northern Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's attacks renewed the anguished debate in Israel over how  
to end the 17-year occupation of southern Lebanon, where 
Iranian-backed Hezbollah has led a guerrilla war to eject Israeli 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu, facing May 17 elections, is caught in a treacherous  
situation, wanting to show strength in the battle with guerrillas 
but wary of heating up a conflict that becomes more unpopular with 
every Israeli casualty. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu has said he will only pull out troops if the Lebanese  
government disarms the Shiite Muslim guerrillas and deploys its 
soldiers along the border, something Lebanon has refused to 
guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest escalation was sparked by a Hezbollah attack on  
Sunday in which an Israeli general, two soldiers and a journalist 
were killed by a roadside bomb in the occupied zone. It came only 
days after three soldiers were killed in a Hezbollah ambush. 
</P>
<P>
	Katyusha rockets were also fired towards Israel on Sunday,  
though Hezbollah denied it was responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, Israel on Sunday bombed Hezbollah bases deep inside  
Lebanon, including a Hezbollah ammunitions depot north of Israel's 
self-declared security zone, the army said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate word on casualties from the strikes,  
which were among the most intensive since a the so-called Grapes of 
Wreath operation in April 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In Lebanon, streets were empty in Marjayoun, the main town in  
the occupied zone, and schools were closed in villages in the south 
and east, as Lebanese braced for any new strikes or intensified 
battles. 
</P>
<P>
	And in northern Israel, the Israeli army ordered hundreds of  
thousands of its citizens living along the border to spend the 
night in shelters in case Hezbollah fired Katyusha rockets across 
the border. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona, several miles from the  
border, restaurants closed early and the streets were deserted. 
Residents canceled several children's costume parties for the 
Jewish holiday of Purim, which began today. 
</P>
<P>
	Hezbollah's Katyusha attacks on northern Israel have become less  
common since Grapes of Wrath, coming mainly in response to deaths 
of Lebanese civilians. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu said Israel would ``spare no effort, political or  
military, in the search for a withdrawal from Lebanon.'' But he 
added that Israel would respond to attacks. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Thousands Take Cover in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIRYAT SHMONA, Israel (AP) -- Fearing a second round of fighting  
between Israel and Lebanese guerrillas, tens of thousands of 
civilians took cover on both sides of the border today. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called for restraint after  
Israel on Sunday made some of its biggest airstrikes in years 
against Hezbollah in response for attacks that killed an Israeli 
general and six other soldiers in southern Lebanon in the past 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	In Jerusalem, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu briefed senior  
ministers on the situation and told them ``the army is poised to 
continue to fight against terrorist forces in Lebanon,'' according 
to a Cabinet statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement did not specify if more airstrikes were to follow.  
But Israeli sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it 
appeared there would not be an escalation unless Hezbollah fired 
Katyusha rockets into northern Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's attacks renewed the anguished debate in Israel over how  
to end the 17-year occupation of southern Lebanon, where 
Iranian-backed Hezbollah has led a guerrilla war to eject Israeli 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu, facing May 17 elections, is caught in a treacherous  
situation, wanting to show strength in the battle with guerrillas 
but wary of heating up a conflict that becomes more unpopular with 
every Israeli casualty. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu has said he will only pull out troops if the Lebanese  
government disarms the Shiite Muslim guerrillas and deploys its 
soldiers along the border, something Lebanon has refused to 
guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest escalation was sparked by a Hezbollah attack on  
Sunday in which an Israeli general, two soldiers and a journalist 
were killed by a roadside bomb in the occupied zone. It came only 
days after three soldiers were killed in a Hezbollah ambush. 
</P>
<P>
	Katyusha rockets were also fired towards Israel on Sunday,  
though Hezbollah denied it was responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, Israel on Sunday bombed Hezbollah bases deep inside  
Lebanon, including a Hezbollah ammunitions depot north of Israel's 
self-declared security zone, the army said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate word on casualties from the strikes,  
which were among the most intensive since a the so-called Grapes of 
Wreath operation in April 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In Lebanon, streets were empty in Marjayoun, the main town in  
the occupied zone, and schools were closed in villages in the south 
and east, as Lebanese braced for any new strikes or intensified 
battles. 
</P>
<P>
	And in northern Israel, the Israeli army ordered hundreds of  
thousands of its citizens living along the border to spend the 
night in shelters in case Hezbollah fired Katyusha rockets across 
the border. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona, several miles from the  
border, restaurants closed early and the streets were deserted. 
Residents canceled several children's costume parties for the 
Jewish holiday of Purim, which began today. 
</P>
<P>
	Hezbollah's Katyusha attacks on northern Israel have become less  
common since Grapes of Wrath, coming mainly in response to deaths 
of Lebanese civilians. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu said Israel would ``spare no effort, political or  
military, in the search for a withdrawal from Lebanon.'' But he 
added that Israel would respond to attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't act, the situation will be much worse,'' he said.  
``We will strike at the Hezbollah with great force and, I am able 
to say, increasing force, if that is what is needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright, visiting China, called on ``all parties to exercise  
restraint'' and to deal with their grievances through the 
five-nation monitoring group set up after ``Grapes of Wrath.''

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stock Prices Fall Again / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stock prices fell today for the second  
consecutive trading day amid continued worries over Japanese 
corporate earnings. The dollar slipped against the yen on 
profit-taking. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 119.12 yen in late afternoon, down 1.20 yen  
from late Friday in Tokyo and also below its New York level of 
119.17 yen late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 145.79 points,  
or 1.01 percent, closing at 14,221.75 points. On Friday, the index 
lost 102.91 points, or 0.71 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock prices started sliding decisively in late afternoon when a  
report hit the market that Fujitsu Ltd., a major Japanese computer 
maker, expected to record the first net loss for its parent company 
in six years. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Tokyo market closed, Fujitsu forecast its net loss  
would amount to $168 million for the parent company, citing 
weaker-than-expected demand for telecommunications equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Also making investors bearish were continued worries about the  
sale of corporate shareholdings ahead of the end of the fiscal 
year, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's fiscal year ends March 31.  
</P>
<P>
	The market was also hurt by a 59.76 point fall in the Dow Jones  
industrial average Friday to 9,306.58, and a sense that U.S. share 
prices are overvalued, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 12.22 points, or 1.09 percent, to 1,107.81 
points at today's close. On Friday, the TOPIX lost 4.10 points, or 
0.36 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section was estimated at 420  
million shares, down from Friday's 469 million shares. Decliners 
outnumbered advancers 707 to 435, with 165 issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar faced selling by U.S. funds to  
take profits despite some buying from Japanese bank players on 
dips. 
</P>
<P>
	The greenback's up-side was limited by yen repatriation from  
overseas by Japanese corporations to prepare for their 
book-closing. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading remained in a narrow range as many investors held back  
to watch at high-level talks on economic deregulation between Japan 
and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were alert to comments from finance officials during  
the talks and also watched a World Bank symposium on global finance 
and development in Tokyo, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 118.85 yen and 119.44 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 130.86 yen, down  
from 132.35 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.860 percent from today's finish of 1.885 percent, 
driving its price up to 99.52 yen from 99.32 yen.

                      *Michael Angelo Avallone    	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Michael Angelo Avallone, a mystery writer who  
penned the Ed Noon series and whose original novels were based on 
the television series ``The Man from U.N.C.L.E.'' and ``Hawaii 
Five-0,'' died Friday at the age of 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Avallone wrote more than 200 books and short stories during his  
45 year career, including Westerns, horror stories and children's 
books. He was best known as the author of the Ed Noon series of 
detective novels published between 1953 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	The author, whose works were translated and published around the  
world, once said he began to write ``when he discovered pencils'' 
and said: ``I never wrote a book I didn't like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His first novel, ``The Tall Dolores,'' was published in 1953 and  
featured his detective character Ed Noon. He went on to pen 36 Ed 
Noon novels. 
</P>
<P>
	He also wrote gothic romances under the pen name Edwina Noone.

</P>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Jazz critic Stanley Dance, a 1963 Grammy winner  
and confidant of Duke Ellington and Earl Hines, died Tuesday of 
pneumonia. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Dance was one of the genre's most respected critics and his work  
spanned 60 years. He won a Grammy Award in 1963 for writing the 
liner notes for the album ``The Ellington Era.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also wrote liner notes for the Sweet Baby Blues Band and was  
featured chanting on the track ``Sometimes it be That Way'' on 
singer-pianist Jeannie Cheatham's 1987 album ``Homeward Bound.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born in England, Dance began writing about jazz professionally  
in 1935, eventually marrying Helen Oakley, who was in charge of 
Variety Records and produced several of Ellington's small group 
records in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
	His work appeared in the New York Herald Tribune, Saturday  
Review, Down Beat and Jazz Times.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Winthrop Edey, internationally known for his  
love and knowledge of clocks and the keeper of a meticulous diary 
documenting life in New York, died Feb. 22 from Hodgkin's disease. 
He was 61. 
</P>
<P>
	Edey gained international recognition as an expert on antique  
clocks and started buying them before they were considered 
collector's items. He helped the Frick Collection bring together an 
exhibit of French clocks in 1982. Nine of the best clocks were from 
his own collection. 
</P>
<P>
	Edey also was known for his detailed diary writing, which he  
started at age 6. Some have guessed that his multivolume and still 
unpublished diary could become an important reflection of New York 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	Edey mingled in different art circles and befriended Andy Warhol  
and Robert Mapplethorpe and Andy Warhol, in whose 1963 movie, ``The 
13 Most Beautiful Boys,'' he was included.

<P>
	LAKEWOOD, Colo. (AP) -- Robert Heron, a leader in designing  
tramways and ski lifts, including Aspen Mountain's Lift No. 1, died 
Friday. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Heron, trained as a civil engineer, began his career building  
aerial tramways to haul material to the mines of the Kennicott 
Copper Co. 
</P>
<P>
	While working for the Denver-based Stearns Roger Manufacturing  
Co., Heron came up with trams that the Army's 10th Mountain 
Division used to shuttle ammunition, food, water and casualties 
during the battle of Riva Ridge in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	But Heron is best known for his peacetime work.  
</P>
<P>
	In the mid-1940s, Heron and his older brother formed Heron  
Engineering. Among their first projects was Lift No. 1 on Aspen 
Mountain. The brothers also built one of the world's first double 
chairs, at Berthoud Pass, in 1946.

	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Ken Robinson, a baseball player who was  
trying to make it back to the big leagues through the Arizona 
Diamondbacks minor league camp, was killed early Sunday when a car 
driven by a fellow minor leaguer careened off a Tucson road and 
overturned resulting in severe head injuries. Robinson was 29. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver, pitcher John Rosengren, who was not seriously  
injured, was charged with second-degree murder in what police say 
was an alcohol-related crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson had been a part of the Diamondbacks' 40-man roster in  
spring training a year ago, but missed the season because of 
shoulder surgery. He and Rosengren, who also missed all of last 
season after arm surgery, were awaiting the opening of the 
Diamondbacks' minor league training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, who was was Toronto's 10th-round pick in 1991, had  
brief big league stints as a relief pitcher with the club in 1995 
and 1997, and with Kansas City in 1996. He spent most 1997 with 
Triple-A Syracuse, where he was 7-7 with a 3.56 ERA.

illustrator created the Smokey Bear fire prevention messages that 
became one of the most successful public relations campaigns, died 
Thursday of an intestinal aneurysm. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
	Rossoll provided the rough draft for Smokey Bear in 1944 as the  
character to promote forest fire prevention after rejecting figures 
including a forest ranger and a beaver. 
</P>
<P>
	Rossoll drew more than 1,000 ``Smokey Says'' cartoons that were  
published in newspapers across the nation for 25 years. He also 
talked with foresters in the field and gave talks about Smokey and 
fire prevention to school children.

	GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) -- Richard R. Shinn, who joined MetLife as  
a $15-a-week mailroom employee in 1939 and rose to become chairman 
and chief executive officer, died Friday at age 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Shinn, who was 18 when he went to work for MetLife, was elected  
MetLife's president and a member of the board in 1969. He was 
appointed chief executive officer in 1973 and became chairman of 
the board and CEO in 1980. He retired in 1988. 
</P>
<P>

provider of group insurance and entered the property and casualty 
insurance and reinsurance business. 
</P>
<P>
	He was executive vice president of the New York Stock Exchange  
from 1986 to 1988. He also was a director of St. Vincent's Hospital 
and Medical Center of New York, Vanderbilt University, Barnard 
College ad the Inner City Scholarship Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	He was on the blue ribbon panel that averted New York City's

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Michael St. Clair, an art dealer who helped  
bring public attention to the work of once-overlooked painters 
including Alfred Maurer, Childe Hassam and Marsden Hartley, died 
Monday. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Clair, who was director of the Babcock Galleries for 40  
years, used his influence in the New York art world to promote many 
unsung artists. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1959, he took possession of Hartley's estate from dealer Paul  
Rosenberg, who had been unable to generate interest in the 
painter's work. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next two decades, St. Clair organized 11 Hartley  
exhibitions and eventually sold the artists' paintings to nearly 70 
museums. The Whitney Museum of American Art put on a Hartley 
retrospective in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	He served in the 328th Fighter Squadron in North Africa and  
Europe during World War II, and earned a silver star and three 
bronze stars for bravery.

<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Harriet Waddy, one of the first black  
officers commissioned in the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps during 
World War II and one of the highest ranking black women in its 
successor, the Women's Army Corps, died Feb. 21. She was 94. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Waddy joined the WAAC early in World War II, underwent basic  
training in Iowa and then returned to Washington in 1942 to work as 
an aide to the director of the corps. 
</P>
<P>
	The corps was made part of the regular Army and renamed the  
Women's Army Corps later in 1942. Ms. Waddy graduated from Adjutant 
General's School and was put in charge of 50 civilian typists in 
the Casualty Branch. Their job was to write letters notifying 
families that soldiers had been killed, wounded or were missing in 
action. 
</P>
<P>
	In a newspaper interview from 1942, Waddy said succeeding as a  
WAC would drive a wedge into prejudicial beliefs. She noted that 
her uniform entitled her to go anywhere in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	She served on active duty in the Army until 1952 and was in the  
reserves until 1969. She worked for the Federal Aviation 
Administration for 25 years, retiring in Los Angeles in 1969.

<HEADLINE> Biographer To Publish Whitman Works </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some early poems by Walt Whitman, virtually  
unseen since they first appeared in newspapers where the poet 
worked 150 years ago, are slated to appear in an upcoming 
biography. 
</P>
<P>
	The Library of Congress says Jerome Loving's ``Walt Whitman --  
The Song of Himself'' is the first full-length critical biography 
of the poet in 40 years. It will be published March 11 by the 
University of California Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The author, who teaches at Texas A&AMP;M University, has spent years  
culling the files of old newspapers where Whitman worked. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitman was writing rhymed verse in regular meter when he was in  
his 20s. He moved into free verse in his major work, ``Leaves of 
Grass,'' which he published himself in Philadelphia after the 
Boston district attorney cited 22 passages as violating a state law 
against obscenity. 
</P>
<P>
	Loving calls ``A Sketch'' Whitman's first seashore poem. The New  
York New World published it in 1842, when Whitman was 23. Four 
years ago, Loving identified it and printed all five stanzas in the 
Walt Whitman Quarterly Review. It has not appeared elsewhere, and 
his new book quotes only the last stanza, where Whitman wrote: 
</P>
<P>
	``But here, the billow's heaving breast,  
</P>
<P>
	``And the low thunder's knelling tone,  
</P>
<P>
	``Speak of the wearied soul's unrest,  
</P>
<P>
	``Its murmurings, and conflicts lone.''  
</P>
<P>
	Soon after Whitman became editor of the daily Brooklyn Eagle,  
Loving says he wrote a memorial poem called ``Change,'' now 
identified for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	The poem is unsigned, a usual practice at the time because  
people felt it would divert attention from the solemnity of the 
occasion to put the poet's name on it, Loving said. 
</P>
<P>
	Joann Krieg, another Whitman scholar who teaches at Hofstra  
University, said the early work is ``fourth-rate poetry,'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But it's typical of its time and the papers where it appeared.  
It was only when Whitman brought out ``Leaves of Grass' that he 
thought he could do something different that would find its own 
audience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Loving has also found some forgotten but important prose that  
foreshadows Whitman's later work. 
</P>
<P>
	One paragraph in a speech the poet gave to the Brooklyn Art  
Union is what Loving calls ``almost a free verse poem.'' Divided 
into poetic lines -- Whitman himself had already separated them by 
dashes -- it looks like something from ``Leaves of Grass,'' which 
appeared years later. 
</P>
<P>
	Loving also includes new material to illustrate Whitman's  
campaign -- after publishing ``Leaves of Grass'' -- to win acceptance 
for what many called a dirty book. 
</P>
<P>
	``Remember, it was a time when they even draped piano legs,''  
Loving said.

<HEADLINE> Hundreds of Women Sue Merrill Lynch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) - Marybeth Cremin recalls her boss at Merrill  
Lynch saying women couldn't combine work and family. Other women 
were told they earned less than men because their husbands could 
support them. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Cremin and more than 900 other current and former employees  
of the big securities firm have joined forces. In advance of a 
deadline Tuesday, they've filed claims of discrimination as part of 
the settlement of a class-action lawsuit that is shaking the 
financial services industry. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, the number of claimants is three to four times  
what plaintiffs' lawyers had expected when Merrill settled the suit 
last June. The settlement is also helping change the way 
discrimination cases are handled on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Until recently, nearly all cases were handled through industry  
arbitration -- a system criticized as biased in favor of companies. 
Under the settlement, Merrill Lynch became the first Wall Street 
firm to end mandatory arbitration for civil rights claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now there's accountability and liability,'' said Linda  
Friedman, a partner in the Chicago law firm Stowell &AMP; Friedman, 
which is handling the case. ``Our hope is that this will change the 
balance of power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The firm also represented the plaintiffs in the infamous lawsuit  
alleging widespread discrimination at Smith Barney. That suit -- 
which was settled in July -- grew out of allegations of sexual 
hijinks and pranks in a basement called the ``boom boom room'' at a 
Garden City, N.Y. office. 
</P>
<P>
	To some observers, the cases uncover common problems for women  
on Wall Street. ``It's one of the last bastions of discriminatory 
treatment and unequal standards in the country,'' said Laurel 
Bellows, former head of the American Bar Association's Commission 
on Women. ``The rest of corporate America seems to have figured out 
that they benefit from qualified, intelligent women.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the Merrill Lynch case, originally filed on behalf of Cremin  
and seven other plaintiffs, anyone complaining of discrimination 
will have their claim handled by a court-supervised mediator. If 
necessary, the complaint will go to binding arbitration. Financial 
consultants who worked at Merrill Lynch from January 1994 through 
June 1998 are eligible for redress. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no maximum or minimum amount of money available to the  
plaintiffs, but Cremin said Monday that, given the high earning 
power of the women, millions of dollars could be involved. In 
additional to possible future awards, the eight original plaintiffs 
will share a $600,000 payment for being the first to come forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Most complaints in the case involve economic discrimination --  
the funneling of tips, clients and business to male brokers, the 
plaintiffs' lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Women were often paid lower salaries than less-qualified men,  
then told, ```Well, you have a husband.', or `Men have a family to 
support.''', said Mary Stowell, who is also representing the

	``It was a systemic problem,'' said Cremin, who worked at  
Merrill Lynch for 13 years. ``The accounts and assets were for a 
large part going to male brokers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch spokesman Bill Halldin said the company had ``not  
found any evidence of systemic discrimination'' against any 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``We take all complaints from employees very seriously because  
we have no tolerance for discrimination of any kind,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that the company did away with mandatory arbitration  
because ``there was a perception of unfairness in arbitration and 
we're committed to making our workplace an excellent one and we 
thought this was an important step.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Civil rights and employee groups have been pressuring the  
industry to do away with mandatory arbitration for years, and in 
the last year, regulatory organizations began joining Merrill Lynch 
in moving away from the system. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning Jan. 1, the National Association of Security Dealers  
ended its requirement for arbitration in discrimination cases. 
Individual securities firms can still impose the mandate on their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
	Women's rights advocates applaud the legal developments, which  
threaten firms with public exposure and pay-outs if they allow 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	``Litigation is frequently the first wave of change,'' observed  
Sheila Wellington, head of Catalyst, a group that works to advance 
women in business and is currently studying women on Wall Street. 
``We will be watching, and others will too.''

<HEADLINE> Obasanjo Back in Power in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) -- A retired general who 20 years ago stepped  
down as the head of a military junta was declared the winner Monday 
of Nigeria's presidential elections amid widespread allegations of 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	The election won by former Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo (o-LOO-she-gun  
o-BA-SAN-jo) had been billed as the final step in a return to 
democracy for Africa's most populous country. 
</P>
<P>
	But election monitors from the United States found flaws in the  
electoral process, including inflated vote returns, ballot box 
stuffing and altered results. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened on Saturday was a farce, a charade,'' declared  
former Finance Minister Olu Falae, Obasanjo's defeated opponent. 
``The degree of fraud was so monumental as to make nonsense of the 
entire process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former President Carter, who led a delegation of observers, told  
Nigerian election officials that fraud was so widespread it was 
impossible to judge whether the results were accurate in the first 
election in 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Local observers were even harsher in their assessment. Nigeria's  
Transition Monitoring Group said parties backing both candidates 
were guilty of cheating and that electoral officers ``colluded 
across the country'' to falsify results. 
</P>
<P>
	Nigeria has never held a presidential election in which the  
loser accepted defeat. In both previous presidential elections, in 
1979 and 1993, the apparent result was contested by at least one of 
the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Obasanjo admitted to irregularities, but said they were  
committed by ``ignorant'' people, and should not influence opinions 
about the results. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe there is anywhere in the world where elections  
are conducted by human beings that are perfect. And Nigeria would 
not be an exception,'' Obasanjo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Obasanjo had captured 63 percent of the vote, while Falae took  
37 percent, Nigerian election officials said Monday. About 30 
million votes were cast. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate is now turning to whether the questions of fraud will  
overshadow Obasanjo's four-year tenure, which begins May 29 when 
Nigeria's current military leader, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, steps 
down. 
</P>
<P>
	Falae called on Nigerians to take to the streets.  
</P>
<P>
	``Millions of Nigerians who voted for us have a duty to show  
their dissatisfaction by protesting against the government,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no immediate signs of public anger. Streets were calm  
in Nigeria's southwest, which voted overwhelmingly for Falae and 
has long been the center of Nigeria's democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Many southwesterners are deeply suspicious of Obasanjo's  
military ties --even though he gave up his position as junta leader 
in 1979, handing over power to a civilian government and was a 
political prisoner during the rule of former dictator Gen. Sani 
Abacha. 
</P>
<P>
	The military refused to publicly take sides in the election, but  
army generals financed Obasanjo's campaign and created a powerful 
political machine that overwhelmed Falae. 
</P>
<P>
	Obasanjo pledged to nurture democracy. In doing so, he faces  
enormous challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	Corruption and mismanagement have hobbled a nation that is awash  
in oil wealth, leaving much of its infrastructure crumbling -- 
without proper electricity, water and phone service. 
</P>
<P>
	While most the nation remains mired in poverty, a small coterie  
of soldiers, politicians and businessmen close to the junta have 
skimmed billions of dollars from the treasury. 
</P>
<P>
	Obasanjo has said he will establish a tribunal to investigate --  
even though he also promised not to conduct a purge of the 
military, who are among the main culprits. 
</P>
<P>
	Change began in Nigeria in June, when Abacha's brutal five-year  
dictatorship came to an end with his sudden death, leading the way 
for Abubakar to launch the democratic transition program. 
</P>
<P>
	For some Nigerians, the results meant that military rule was  
finally over. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the end of the rule of the generals,'' said Lawal  
Isyaku, 30. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lagos school teacher Dele Adeniyi saw no reason to be happy.  
</P>
<P>
	``His success in the election is the success of the military,''  
he said as he waited for a bus. ``Why should civilians celebrate 
it?''

<HEADLINE> Still Time To Switch From Roth IRA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- People who rushed last year to convert their  
traditional individual retirement accounts to new Roth IRAs still 
can switch back and affect their 1998 tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
	Taxpayers had until the end of December to convert their regular  
IRAs to Roth IRAs if they wanted to enjoy a four-year window in 
which to pay taxes on the switch. Conversions made after 1998 
require all taxes to be paid in that tax year. 
</P>
<P>
	But many people probably did not take the time to fully analyze  
how the change could affect their 1998 tax returns in other ways. 
Now is a good time to do so, tax advisers say. 
</P>
<P>
	``It probably wasn't a bad idea to shoot first and ask questions  
later,'' said Martin Nissenbaum, national director of tax planning 
at the Ernst &AMP; Young accounting firm. ``Now you can sit in the calm 
of 1999 and actually run the numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taxpayers have until April 15 -- and possibly up to Oct. 15 if  
the Internal Revenue Service grants an extension -- to switch from a 
Roth IRA back to a regular IRA and obtain tax benefits for their 
1998 tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth IRAs, available for the first time in 1998, proved hugely  
popular because they allow after-tax contributions to be withdrawn 
tax-free, provided the account has been open for at least five tax 
years and the investor is age 59 1/2 or older. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditional IRAs have the same $2,000 annual contribution limit  
as a Roth, but they differ in that taxes are due on the amount 
withdrawn at the end. Most tax advisers say a Roth IRA sharply 
lowers the overall tax bill because the money paid in was taxed at 
a lower rate. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are some pitfalls that some people may not have  
realized when they switched to a Roth IRA. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, because only individuals and married couples  
earning less than $100,000 annually can make such a conversion, 
some taxpayers may have to switch back to a traditional IRA because 
their income was higher than anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
	Others did not know that the amount converted to a Roth IRA is  
counted as income by the IRS in terms of the impact on other tax 
benefits, such as the new $400 child tax credit, the new education 
credits or many deductions. 
</P>
<P>
	These credits are phased out once a taxpayer's adjusted gross  
income passes certain levels. For some taxpayers, it may make sense 
to switch back to a traditional IRA so that those benefits are not 
lost, Ernst &AMP; Young's Nissenbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a whole litany of things that tie into your adjusted  
gross income,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other tax benefits possibly affected include miscellaneous  
deductions for such things as unreimbursed business expenses, 
personal exemptions and itemized deductions and medical deductions. 
All of these can be reduced or lost once income reaches certain 
thresholds. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other possible reasons to reconsider a Roth IRA are:  
</P>
<P>
	--The value of the Roth IRA has declined since the conversion.  
Because of the bullish stock market, advisers say this probably 
affects few people. 
</P>
<P>
	--It makes sense to recharacterize a portion of the Roth IRA to a  
traditional IRA for reasons such as reducing the overall tax burden 
made by the conversion. 
</P>
<P>
	--The conversion placed a taxpayer in a higher tax bracket.  
Remember, the IRS considers the amount converted as income. 
</P>
<P>
	--For Social Security recipients, the higher income level takes a  
bigger bite out of those checks. 
</P>
<P>
	People who did not convert to a Roth IRA in 1998 lost their  
chance to pay the tax over four years. But Nissenbaum said it 
probably still makes sense to make the switch in 1999 if long-term 
savings is the main goal. 
</P>
<P>
	One way of spreading out the tax liability in making a  
conversion from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA is to do it in 
increments, say 20 percent a year for five years. The taxes then 
would be paid in smaller chunks. 
</P>
<P>
	``You would be able to manage your tax bracket and your ability  
to take other credits and deductions,'' Nissenbaum said.

<HEADLINE> CDC Hosts Gulf War Illness Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- In the eight years since the Persian Gulf War's  
end, thousands of soldiers have complained of chronic, unexplained 
maladies such as fatigue, joint pain and memory loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the so-called Gulf War syndrome has stumped medical  
specialists. Researchers have been unable to link the symptoms of 
those who served in the 1991 war to any particular disease or 
biological agent, although the government has acknowledged the 
illnesses are real. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began  
a three-day conference in which doctors, scientists and veterans' 
advocates hope to develop recommendations for future research. 
</P>
<P>
	CDC spokeswoman Gail Hayes said researchers are trying to  
understand the relationship between chemical exposures during the 
war and illnesses from which the veterans say they suffer. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1997 congressional investigation said likely causes included  
exposure to pesticides, smoke from oil well fires and other toxins. 
But the government contends that lack of solid diagnoses or 
evidence of clear causes has hampered the path toward remedies. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we are going to ask young men and women to put their lives  
on the line defending this country, we owe it to them and their 
families to provide the best quality medical treatment,'' U.S. Rep. 
Bernard Sanders, I-Vt., said Sunday during his opening remarks. 
``Up to this point, we have not done this for Gulf War veterans. We 
must rectify this situation as soon as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon has admitted that as many as 100,000 U.S. troops  
may have been exposed to low doses of nerve gases, but contends the 
doses were too small to have caused any long-term health problems.

<HEADLINE> Study Says Light Trucks Are Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The latest government crash tests provide more  
evidence that sport utility vehicles, pickups and minivans pose a 
greater risk of injury and death to drivers and passengers in cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Monday  
released results of four tests involving offset front-end crashes 
between a 1997 Honda Accord and four other vehicles: a 1998 
Chevrolet S-10 compact pickup; a 1997 Dodge Caravan minivan; a 1997 
Ford Explorer SUV; and a 1997 Chevrolet Lumina sedan. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were similar to those of last year's side-impact  
crash tests involving the same models. In nearly every injury 
measurement, the driver dummy in the Accord sustained greater 
injuries in 35-mph crashes with the pickup, minivan and SUV than it 
did in a crash with the other sedan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Accord dummy in the front passenger seat sustained greater  
injuries when the car was struck by the minivan and SUV. But injury 
measurements were higher when the Accord was struck by the Lumina 
than they were when the car was struck by the pickup. The midsize 
Lumina is heavier than the S-10. 
</P>
<P>
	Agency officials warned that more research is needed to  
determine what can be done to make so-called light trucks less 
dangerous in collisions with cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Light trucks generally are heavier, ride higher and have stiffer  
frames than cars, which means more energy in a crash is transferred 
to the car in an accident. Regulators have been increasingly 
worried about this mismatch between light trucks and cars as trucks 
have become more common on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Light trucks now account for nearly half of all new vehicles  
sold in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert C. Lange, engineering director of vehicle development for  
General Motors Corp., noted that with one exception, the dummies in 
all the vehicles sustained survivable injuries despite the severity 
of the crashes -- including the Honda's occupants. 
</P>
<P>
	``This series of crash tests does not appear to show there's a  
huge crash-compatibility problem between cars and light trucks,'' 
Lange said. ``It seems to prove, once again, that physics work: The 
occupants of the heavier vehicles are going to fare better than the 
occupants of a lighter vehicle in a collision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a related study released Monday at the Society of Automotive  
Engineers' annual convention, the University of Michigan's 
Transportation Research Institute found that being struck by a 
light truck is worse than being struck by a car of the same weight. 
That's true whether it's a front-end or side-impact crash, the 
study said. 
</P>
<P>
	That study, based on actual crash data, determined that about  
twice as many car drivers are killed in car-light truck collisions 
than in similar collisions between cars, in which the other car was 
of the same weight as the light truck. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, the study estimates, at least 2,000 car occupants would  
not have died had their cars collided with other cars instead of 
light trucks of the same weight. 
</P>
<P>
	Lange said such a claim ``is a pretty significant  
oversimplification of the facts'' that does not take into account 
the safety benefit that SUVs and other light trucks provide their 
occupants. Nor, he said, does it consider the increased threat to 
those riding in light trucks if those vehicles are designed more 
like cars. 
</P>
<P>
	NHTSA administrator Ricardo Martinez said in a statement that  
the research ``highlights the fact that, regardless of weight, 
vehicle design can play a major role in aggressivity. The Michigan 
study is testimony to the fact that many lives can be saved if we 
can use the tools we are creating to build less aggressive 
vehicles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To address such concerns, Ford Motor Co. last week announced  
that its nearly 7-foot tall Excursion SUV, which is classified as a 
medium-duty truck, would include a tubular steel bar under the 
bumper to prevent the truck from riding over a car in a front-end 
wreck. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's a step in the right direction,'' NHTSA engineer  
William T. Hollowell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford spokeswoman Jennifer Flake said automakers also have  
responded with more widespread use of side-impact air bags on cars. 
In redesigning their trucks, automakers also are looking at 
lowering truck bumpers to make them more compatible with car 
bumpers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We support NHTSA in its ongoing research efforts to enhance  
the knowledge about compatibility and to help automakers further 
enhance car and truck designs,'' Flake said.

<HEADLINE>  Spring Training Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Roger Clemens' debut for the New York Yankees is all set.  
</P>
<P>
	The five-time Cy Young winner will make his first spring  
training start Saturday on the road in a split-squad game against 
the Kansas City Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Joe Torre picked Clemens to pitch in Haines City, Fla.,  
about 60 miles east of the Yankees' camp in Tampa, for a reason. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to stay away from the media circus more than  
anything,'' Torre said. ``That was the purpose for not pitching him 
against Toronto the first couple of days and I said I might as well 
do the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, traded by Toronto to the World Series champions on Feb.  
18, will work a maximum of three innings or around 45 pitches 
against the Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens threw 56 pitches during his second batting practice  
stint on Sunday. Torre has not decided on who will start the 
regular-season opener at Oakland or the Yankee Stadium opener 
against Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still haven't put it together yet,'' Torre said. ``We have  
a lot options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pittsburgh Pirates, meanwhile, are becoming concerned about  
right fielder Jose Guillen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates excused him from the first few days of spring  
training because of his father's death. But as of Sunday, they had 
not heard from him for several days. 
</P>
<P>
	And, aware of how close Guillen was to his father, the Pirates  
were worried he wouldn't be able to fully concentrate on baseball 
once he arrives at Bradenton, Fla., from the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would like to get him in here so we can get him going,''  
general manager Cam Bonifay said. 
</P>
<P>
	Guillen hit .267 with 14 home runs and 84 RBIs last season. If  
he does not report in the next several days, Al Martin will 
probably start in left field and Brian Giles might make a few 
starts in right field once the exhibition games begin Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado Rockies have no such concerns about third baseman  
Vinny Castilla, especially this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Castilla, born in Mexico, has already circled April 4 on his  
calendar -- that's the date the Rockies play San Diego in the major 
league opener at Monterrey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so excited about this game,'' Castilla said at Tucson,  
Ariz. ``It's going to be in front of my people. They've followed me 
all through my career. ... People love me over there. I love them, 
too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Castilla, who has hit at least 40 home runs in three straight  
seasons, is Mexico's biggest baseball star since Fernando 
Valenzuela started throwing his screwball for the Los Angeles 
Dodgers nearly 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's like the president out there,'' said Colorado Rockies  
outfielder Curtis Goodwin, who played with Castilla in the Mexican 
winter league. ``He's probably bigger than the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Braves also seem to be looking ahead to the start of  
the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Bobby Cox, who already has chosen rookie Bruce Chen as  
the starter for the Grapefruit League opener Friday against 
Houston, revealed the rest of his pitching plans. 
</P>
<P>
	In the process, Cox gave the likely order for his top four  
starters once the real season begins. 
</P>
<P>
	Cy Young winner Tom Glavine will pitch Saturday against Tampa  
Bay, meaning he probably will start the April 5 opener against 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine will be followed by Greg Maddux, John Smoltz and Kevin  
Millwood (17-8), which seems the logical order for the rotation. 
Chen is expected to be the fifth starter.

<HEADLINE>  Spring Training Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Roger Clemens' debut for the New York Yankees is all set.  
</P>
<P>
	The five-time Cy Young winner will make his first spring  
training start Saturday on the road in a split-squad game against 
the Kansas City Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Joe Torre picked Clemens to pitch in Haines City, Fla.,  
about 60 miles east of the Yankees' camp in Tampa, for a reason. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to stay away from the media circus more than  
anything,'' Torre said. ``That was the purpose for not pitching him 
against Toronto the first couple of days and I said I might as well 
do the same.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens, traded by Toronto to the World Series champions on Feb.  
18, will work a maximum of three innings or around 45 pitches 
against the Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens threw 56 pitches during his second batting practice  
stint on Sunday. Torre has not decided on who will start the 
regular-season opener at Oakland or the Yankee Stadium opener 
against Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still haven't put it together yet,'' Torre said. ``We have  
a lot options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pittsburgh Pirates, meanwhile, are becoming concerned about  
right fielder Jose Guillen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates excused him from the first few days of spring  
training because of his father's death. But as of Sunday, they had 
not heard from him for several days. 
</P>
<P>
	And, aware of how close Guillen was to his father, the Pirates  
were worried he wouldn't be able to fully concentrate on baseball 
once he arrives at Bradenton, Fla., from the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would like to get him in here so we can get him going,''  
general manager Cam Bonifay said. 
</P>
<P>
	Guillen hit .267 with 14 home runs and 84 RBIs last season. If  
he does not report in the next several days, Al Martin will 
probably start in left field and Brian Giles might make a few 
starts in right field once the exhibition games begin Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado Rockies have no such concerns about third baseman  
Vinny Castilla, especially this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Castilla, born in Mexico, has already circled April 4 on his  
calendar -- that's the date the Rockies play San Diego in the major 
league opener at Monterrey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so excited about this game,'' Castilla said at Tucson,  
Ariz. ``It's going to be in front of my people. They've followed me 
all through my career. ... People love me over there. I love them, 
too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Castilla, who has hit at least 40 home runs in three straight  
seasons, is Mexico's biggest baseball star since Fernando 
Valenzuela started throwing his screwball for the Los Angeles 
Dodgers nearly 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's like the president out there,'' said Colorado Rockies  
outfielder Curtis Goodwin, who played with Castilla in the Mexican 
winter league. ``He's probably bigger than the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Braves also seem to be looking ahead to the start of  
the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Bobby Cox, who already has chosen rookie Bruce Chen as  
the starter for the Grapefruit League opener Friday against 
Houston, revealed the rest of his pitching plans. 
</P>
<P>
	In the process, Cox gave the likely order for his top four  
starters once the real season begins. 
</P>
<P>
	Cy Young winner Tom Glavine will pitch Saturday against Tampa  
Bay, meaning he probably will start the April 5 opener against 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Glavine will be followed by Greg Maddux, John Smoltz and Kevin  
Millwood (17-8), which seems the logical order for the rotation. 
Chen is expected to be the fifth starter.

<HEADLINE> Paper: U.S. Used UN To Spy on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S intelligence agents entered Iraq and spied  
on its military for three years under the guise of U.N. arms 
control inspectors, according to The Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said in its Tuesday editions that the U.N. Special  
Commission was not aware it had been infiltrated by U.S. spies and 
did not authorize or benefit from the operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration officials have acknowledged gaining  
valuable information about Iraq as a byproduct of its cooperation 
with UNSCOM in rooting out Saddam Hussein's forbidden missile, 
nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs. 
</P>
<P>
	But the administration has disputed claims that U.S.  
intelligence directly used UNSCOM to penetrate Iraq's security 
forces and undermine the Iraqi regime. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our support was specifically tailored to facilitate the U.N.  
Special Commission's mission and for no other purpose,'' State 
Department spokesman James P. Rubin said in early January. 
</P>
<P>
	The Post, citing government employees and documents describing  
classified operations, said U.S. agents rigged UNSCOM equipment and 
office space -- without permission -- to intercept Iraqi military 
communications between commanders and infantry and armored forces 
in the field. 
</P>
<P>
	American intelligence agents infiltrated the system when UNSCOM  
changed the arrangement it used to monitor distant sites in Iraq 
with video cameras. The U.S. technicians who installed and 
maintained the system were intelligence operatives, and they hid 
antennas capable of intercepting transmissions in the equipment, 
the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least two other technicians lent by the U.S. government to  
run the remote camera system for UNSCOM were employees of the 
Central Intelligence Agency, according to the Post.

<HEADLINE> Injured Ex-Olympic Skier Recovering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) -- Former U.S. Olympic freestyle ski team  
member Jim Moran, who suffered a severe head injury Feb. 20, was 
taken off a respirator Monday and was breathing on his own, his 
doctor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moran remained slightly sedated, but ``has opened his eyes and  
recognized his family,'' said Dr. William Pfeifer, trauma surgeon 
for Swedish Medical Center-HealthONE. 
</P>
<P>
	Moran was injured when he landed after an aerial spin at the  
U.S. Freeskiing Open at Vail and was air-lifted to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is past the critical, life-threatening stage of his  
injuries and we are now focused on Jim's recovery,'' Pfeifer said. 
Pfeifer said Moran would remain in intensive care for another day, 
then begin evaluation for rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Moran left the U.S. team after finishing 23rd in the moguls  
competition at the Nagano Olympics. He skied to two World Cup 
moguls victories, a 1993 event in Breckenridge and a 1996 
competition in Altenmarkt, Austria.

<HEADLINE> Court Mulls Damages for Sex Bias </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court struggled Monday over the  
question of when victims of job discrimination should be allowed to 
seek extra damages to punish their employers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This statute is simply confusing,'' Chief Justice William H.  
Rehnquist said, referring to a federal law that permits people who 
suffer intentional discrimination to collect punitive damages. 
``Nobody can pretend that it's a clear guideline as to where a 
court ought to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carole Kolstad won a back-pay award from the American Dental  
Association on grounds it failed to promote her because of her sex. 
But a lower court would not let her seek punitive damages -- 
intended to punish and deter future misconduct -- without proving 
that her employer's conduct was ``egregious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer, Eric Schnapper, told the justices the federal  
job-bias law does not require such proof. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Congress goes ahead and spells out the standards it had  
in mind, I don't think it's appropriate to add to them,'' Schnapper 
said in an argument supported by the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dental association's lawyer, Raymond C. Fay, told the  
justices that Kolstad's argument would allow virtually everyone who 
proves intentional job discrimination to seek punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. law has a ``tradition of a more difficult standard of  
proof'' for such damages, Fay said, adding there was no evidence 
that Congress intended to deviate from that stricter standard. 
</P>
<P>
	Kolstad sued under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,  
which bars employment discrimination based on race, sex, national 
origin and religion. 
</P>
<P>
	The law allows victims of intentional job discrimination to  
collect punitive damages if they can show their employer acted with 
``malice or with reckless indifference'' to their rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice David H. Souter suggested the law sets a stricter  
standard for awarding punitive damages because it requires proof 
that employers who intentionally discriminated against someone also 
knew they were violating the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Antonin Scalia wondered what might count as an egregious  
act, interjecting a few moments later, ``I have it. Firing on 
Christmas Eve; that would do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Stephen G. Breyer noted the law allows juries to decide  
whether to award punitive damages and sets limits on the amount. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why should we fight so hard to resist eligibility for  
punitives in a statute that has two other checks?'' he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Breyer also asked whether firing someone because of their sex or  
race, and knowing the action was unlawful, would be considered 
egregious. 
</P>
<P>
	``It very well may be,'' Fay said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court's decision, expected by July, will govern the  
award of punitive damages not only in sex-bias cases, but also in 
the other types of discrimination banned by Title VII. The civil 
rights law was amended in 1991 to allow victims of intentional bias 
to collect punitive damages of up to $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Kolstad was the Chicago-based dental association's director of  
federal agency relations in Washington when the director of 
legislation announced his retirement in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	A male co-worker got the job and Kolstad sued, saying he was  
chosen because of sex bias against her. She also said a supervisor 
told sexually offensive jokes at staff meetings and described 
professionally prominent women in sexually derogatory terms. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal jury ruled the association discriminated against  
Kolstad and awarded her $52,718 in back pay. The trial judge 
refused to let the jury consider awarding punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The full U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of  
Columbia agreed, saying that to collect damages she would have to 
show ``egregious conduct'' by her employer. 
</P>
<P>
	In other action Monday, the court:  
</P>
<P>
	--Let stand the cross-burning convictions of three North Carolina  
men who tried to intimidate their neighbors, an interracial couple. 
The men argued that their convictions violated their free-speech 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	--Agreed to use a clean-water dispute from South Carolina to  
clarify how far private citizens can pursue lawsuits against 
polluters.

<HEADLINE> New Yorker Cover Irks Police Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The city's police are outraged over a cartoon on  
the cover of The New Yorker that shows an officer at a carnival 
shooting gallery, firing at targets shaped like innocent civilians. 
</P>
<P>
	A sign on the shooting gallery says ``41 shots 10 cents'' -- an  
allusion to the Feb. 4 killing of an unarmed man by four New York 
police officers who fired 41 shots in the vestibule of his 
apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine's March 8 cover is ``a cheap shot'' that  
``trivializes all the good police officers do,'' protested Jim 
Savage, acting president of the police union, the Patrolmen's 
Benevolent Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The illustrator, Pulitzer Prize-winning artist Art Spiegelman,  
said: ``They should be upset by it. I hope they are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the cover is a commentary on how people are now ``afraid  
of our protectors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting gallery targets are silhouettes of a  
briefcase-toting man, a child with an ice cream cone and an old 
woman with a cane. 
</P>
<P>
	The killing of Amadou Diallo has sparked protests by minority  
leaders who believe the shooting had racial overtones. All four 
officers are white; Diallo was a black immigrant from West Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting is under investigation by a grand jury. None of the  
officers has been charged. Their lawyer has said they thought 
Diallo was armed. The officers were searching for a rapist. 
</P>
<P>
	Spiegelman said the magazine cover was also a commentary on the  
case of Haitian immigrant Abner Louima, who was allegedly sodomized 
with a wooden toilet plunger handle in a police station in 1997. 
Four officers face charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Savage said he spent Monday morning trying to calm angry  
officers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This depicts cops as not really caring about the public they  
serve,'' he said. ``It says that they can just pick off innocent 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police Commissioner Howard Safir said: ``The editors of The New  
Yorker magazine should apologize not only to the dedicated men and 
women of the New York City Police Department, but to the widows and 
families of those NYPD officers who have given their lives to make 
this city a safer place for all of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spiegelman, who won a Pulitzer for ``Maus,'' a comic book  
depiction of the Holocaust, raised eyebrows before with covers that 
showed a Hasidic Jew kissing a black woman and a business-suited 
Easter Bunny in a crucifixion pose across a tax form.

<HEADLINE> Study: Cleaning House Reduces Lead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Keeping a clean house can significantly reduce  
the amount of toxic lead that children absorb into their blood, 
according to a study. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers followed 99 urban children with high levels of lead  
in their blood for nine to 15 months after dividing their families 
into two groups. In one group, the children's caretakers received 
education and free housecleaning to reduce lead levels in their 
homes; in the other, caretakers received education only. 
</P>
<P>
	The cleaning removed dust containing lead particles, presumably  
from peeling paint, which was found in most of the children's 
homes, the study in the March issue of Pediatrics said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the homes cleaned, two workers visited an average of every  
eight to 13 days and vacuumed floors and carpets with a 
high-efficiency vacuum cleaner. They also wet-wiped or mopped 
walls, horizontal surfaces and uncarpeted floors with a detergent 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of the study, lead levels among the 46 children whose  
homes had been cleaned fell an average of 17 percent. Children 
whose homes had been cleaned the most -- 20 or more times -- averaged 
a 34 percent blood-lead reduction. 
</P>
<P>
	Blood-lead levels among the other children did not change  
significantly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Regular home cleaning, accompanied by maternal education, is a  
safe and partially effective intervention that should be 
recommended for the large majority of lead-exposed children for 
whom, unfortunately, removal to lead-safe housing is not an 
option,'' said the researchers, led by Dr. George G. Rhoads of the 
University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-Robert Wood 
Johnson Medical School and Rutgers, The State University, 
Piscataway, N.J.

<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Federal Bureau of Investigation chief  
Louis Freeh says Sydney's 2000 Olympic Games could be the target of 
an attack by Islamic terrorist Osama Bin Laden. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeh, in Australia giving advice on law and order issues, made  
his comments on Channel Nine television Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if Sydney was at risk of attack by Bin Laden because  
of the large contingent of U.S. athletes and spectators attending 
the event, Freeh replied ``exactly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``His threat, or Fatwah, (is) against not only Americans but the  
friends of America who we believe are clearly most of the world, 
and certainly our very close friends here in this part of the 
world,'' Freeh said. 
</P>
<P>
	``So I think the Olympics, APEC, the America's Cup -- these are  
all opportunities for someone who has a terrorist agenda to take 
advantage of an opportunity.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Magazines Hurt Girls' Images </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Many girls mistakenly think they are overweight  
because they are getting the wrong idea of the perfect body from 
fashion magazines, a study found. 
</P>
<P>
	More than two-thirds of girls in grades five through 12 said  
magazine photos influenced their notion of the ultimate figure, 
according to researchers in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-seven percent said they wanted to lose weight because of  
those pictures. But only 29 percent of the 548 girls interviewed 
were actually considered overweight, according to the study, 
published in the March issue of the journal Pediatrics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even among the girls who don't read the magazines, very  
frequently, they, too, felt influenced,'' said Alison E. Field, an 
epidemiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital and the study's lead 
author. ``It really does permeate society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The girls filled out questionnaires during mandatory gym classes  
in an unidentified working-class suburb north of Boston. The study 
was conducted in 1991, just as thin, ``waiflike'' models were 
coming back into vogue. 
</P>
<P>
	Each girl was asked to provide her age, weight and height and  
was asked whether she regularly read magazines such as Seventeen, 
Glamour, Jet or the now-defunct Sassy. The girls answered questions 
about dieting habits and how they viewed their bodies -- satisfied 
or dissatisfied. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty-six percent of the girls said they wanted to lose weight.  
Researchers said they suspected the number would have been higher 
if the study focused exclusively on older teens. 
</P>
<P>
	About one-third of the respondents were in elementary school.  
Even at that age, 50 percent reported reading fashion magazines at 
least two to five times a month. 
</P>
<P>
	High-frequency magazine readers of any age were three times more  
likely to exercise and lose weight than infrequent readers, and 
three times more likely to have unrealistic body expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Editors at Seventeen and Glamour said Monday the results weren't  
surprising. 
</P>
<P>
	``The magazines reflect what's going on in the runways because  
they're fashion magazines and the models on the runways are 
stick-thin,'' said Patrice Adcroft, editor in chief at Seventeen. 
</P>
<P>
	This month's issue of Seventeen includes -- for the first time --  
a plus-size model in a fashion spread. The young woman, who wears a 
size 14, is paired with very slender models in an article on prom 
dresses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Young girls reading magazines certainly compare their bodies  
to the models that they see in there and come away with sometimes 
unhappy feelings with the way they look,'' said Stephanie Dolgoff, 
executive editor of Glamour, which targets 18- to 35-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
	But the women's magazines, she said, are being unfairly singled  
out for their influence on adolescents, as if ``girls don't have 
the ability to discern between what's fantasy and what's reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Field's study used national weight standards from the 1970s  
to determine what qualified as overweight. For example, a 5-foot-4 
16-year-old girl would be considered overweight if she weighed more 
than 145 pounds. The healthy weight range for a girl that age would 
be between 105 and 140 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	For a 13-year-old 5-foot girl, the overweight benchmark was 120  
pounds or higher. The median healthy weight for that age and height 
is 90 to 95 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	On a positive note, the study found that girls who read fashion  
magazines were more likely to exercise rather than diet to lose 
weight -- a signal that the publications are teaching girls about 
the importance of good health, Ms. Field said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly have a problem with overweight'' in America, she  
said. ``But the answer is not to make everyone overly concerned 
with their weight.''

<HEADLINE> St. Louis Blues Sign Goalie Carey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The St. Louis Blues, seeking to shore up a  
season-long weakness at goaltender, signed former Vezina Trophy 
winner Jim Carey on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Carey was released by the Boston Bruins earlier in the day,  
clearing the way for the Blues to sign him. 
</P>
<P>
	Carey, 24, won the Vezina Trophy as the NHL's top goalie in the  
1995-96 season with the Washington Capitals. He played in 71 games 
that season, with a 35-24-9 record and 2.26 goals against average. 
</P>
<P>
	But his stock has fallen sharply since then. Carey was traded to  
Boston during the 1996-97 season, but struggled with the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, Carey played 30 games with Providence of the  
American Hockey League, where he posted a 17-8-3 record and 2.34 
goals against average. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported Monday that the Bruins had  
been negotiating a buyout of Carey's contract. He was to earn $2.3 
million this season, and $2.7 million next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Carey cleared waivers on Saturday, with every NHL team passing  
on him because the claiming team would have had to pick up his 
salary in full. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues have struggled all season at goalie. Grant Fuhr,  
recovering from his third operation on his right knee, is 7-7-5 
with a 2.70 goals against average and .876 save percentage. Jamie 
McLennan is 12-14-3 with a 2.38 GAA and a .887 save percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Brent Johnson started the past two games. The Blues won  
both games -- 4-2 against Calgary on Friday, and 3-1 vs. Chicago on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Carey will join the Blues on Tuesday, when they play at  
Nashville.

<HEADLINE> Packers Cancel Stadium Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- The Green Bay Packers said Monday they  
will cancel a stadium-expansion plan because of a need for spending 
money on players' contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Ron Wolf has assurances that ``we would give him  
everything he needed to build a competitive team,'' club president 
Bob Harlan said. ``We owe that to him and (coach) Ray Rhodes and 
our fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cancelation affects two phases of a $75 million construction  
program at Lambeau Field. 
</P>
<P>
	The first phase included remodeling the press box, widening a  
concourse area, opening an apparel shop and adding concession 
stands. The second involved building a dining hall, raising the 
south-end scoreboard and altering club seats. 
</P>
<P>
	The team hoped to finance the work through a stock sale. By  
1998, the sale produced only $24 million toward a goal of $80 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers announced during the weekend an increase in ticket  
prices, saying more money is needed for players' contracts. For 
most seats, the price this fall rises between $5 and $7. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's budget restrictions similarly make it wise to invest  
construction money in personnel, Harlan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We decided, rather than put it in concrete, we would put it  
into the football field,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Group Won't Recommend Circumcision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The nation's most influential group of  
pediatricians has concluded that the benefits of circumcising 
newborns aren't significant enough to recommend it as a routine 
procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Academy of Pediatrics stopped short of advising  
against circumcision. But the group recommended for the first time 
Monday that newborns get pain relief for it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The weight of the evidence would have to be significant for  
the academy to recommend an elective surgical procedure on every 
newborn male, and the evidence is not sufficient for us to make 
such a recommendation,'' said Dr. Carole Lannon, chairwoman of the 
task force that wrote the new policy statement for the academy, 
which has 55,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the last 15 years or so, a grass-roots anti-circumcision  
movement and debate in the medical community have stirred new doubt 
and discussion about the procedure, with opponents saying it leaves 
long-term psychological scars and diminishes sexual pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what that means is the medical debate is over,'' said  
Ronald Goldman, director of the Circumcision Resource Center, an 
anti-circumcision organization. ``I think circumcision is now an 
ethical issue. It challenges us to empathize with newborn 
infants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just how many newborns are circumcised annually is unclear.  
Federal figures show that nearly two-thirds of American boys born 
in 1995 were circumcised, but the pediatrics academy said those 
statistics were taken from too small a sample to be reliable. 
</P>
<P>
	The new policy statement, outlined in a report in the March  
issue of Pediatrics, the academy's journal, says parents should 
take into account cultural and religious traditions as well as the 
advice of a pediatrician when considering circumcision. 
</P>
<P>
	In its last policy statement on the issue, in 1989, the academy  
said circumcision has potential medical benefits as well as risks 
and should be carefully explained to parents. 
</P>
<P>
	After reviewing scientific evidence, the task force did find  
some medical benefits of circumcision: 
</P>
<P>
	--Boys who have not been circumcised are as much as 12 times more  
likely to get urinary tract infections than those who have been 
circumcised. Uncircumcised boys had a 1-in-100 chance of developing 
such an infection in their first year of life; for circumcised boys 
the chance was 1 in 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	--Some evidence shows penile cancer is more prevalent among  
uncircumcised males. But the disease is so rare, striking just 1 in 
100,000 American males a year, that the researchers found any added 
risk insignificant. 
</P>
<P>
	The academy's report said pain relief is recommended because  
studies have shown that infants circumcised without anesthesia 
experience pain and bodily stress. 
</P>
<P>
	The task force reviewed three forms of pain relief. One involves  
applying a local anesthetic in a cream about an hour before the 
procedure. The two others involve injecting anesthetics into the 
penis. One of those, a subcutaneous ring block, was deemed the most 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi Gerald Chirnomas of Boonton, N.J., who estimates he has  
performed 12,000 circumcisions, said that anesthesia is unnecessary 
and that injections are more painful than the circumcision. He 
allows an infant to suck a little wine from his finger, then gives 
him some sugar water from a bottle after the circumcision for pain 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said the policy statement should not affect observant  
Jews. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jewish people don't do circumcision because it's a healthy  
thing,'' he said. ``We do it because it's a covenantal ritual 
ordained by the Bible.''

<HEADLINE> Colts Sign Bennett, Bratzke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Linebacker Cornelius Bennett, released by  
Atlanta last month in a salary cap move, and unrestricted free 
agent defensive end Chat Bratzke signed Monday with the 
Indianapolis Colts. 
</P>
<P>
	The signings were the latest step in the team's efforts to  
bolster a defensive unit that ranked 29th of 30 teams last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Club president Bill Polian said the signings, along with earlier  
additions of unrestricted free agents Chad Cota and Shawn King, 
represent a step in the right direction in the Colts' rebuilding 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial terms were not announced, but Polian said all four  
contracts were long-term agreements. Bratzke signed for six years, 
Bennett and Cota signed four-year contracts and King agreed to a 
three-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Bratzke was seeking a deal averaging about $5 million per year  
and it was believed the contract includes a signing bonus of more 
than $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	King reportedly signed a contract valued at $6 million, while  
Cota's deal is believed to be worth $9.6 million, including a $2 
million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	It had been reported earlier that Bennett, a five-time Pro Bowl  
player and the only player on five losing Super Bowl teams, had 
agreed to a deal that included a $1.5 million signing bonus and a 
$500,000 base salary in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a huge commitment on the part of Jim, and the franchise,  
to bring players here who can help us win,'' Polian said of team 
owner Jim Irsay. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett, Cota and Bratzke attended the news conference where the  
signings were announced. King was unable to attend due to travel 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The trio all expressed a desire to make an immediate impact.  
Cota and Bennett both said their previous association with Polian, 
who was general manager in Buffalo and Charlotte, was one reason 
they decided to join Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Cota was Carolina's seventh-round draft pick in 1995. He played  
for the Panthers for three years and started 16 games at strong 
safety for New Orleans last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was ready to leave New Orleans and when the situation came  
here, it was a no-brainer. There are a lot of positives coming 
here,'' said Cota, known for his hard-hitting style. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett's arrival in Indianapolis came 3,960 days after he was  
drafted by the Colts in the first-round of the 1987 draft. He never 
signed with Indianapolis and was traded to Buffalo in a three-team, 
10-player deal that brought future Hall of Fame running back Eric 
Dickerson to the Colts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel I've completed a full circle,'' said Bennett, who had  
121 tackles last season as the Falcons reached the Super Bowl. ``I 
came up here several times in 1987 ... every time I'd get here, 
something would come up to take the deal off the table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett was entering the final year of a four-year $13.6 million  
contract and would have counted $3.7 million against the cap this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not here for money, although the money is fair,'' Bennett  
said. ``I've been around for a long time and the only thing I 
really want now is to win the Super Bowl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his career, the 33-year-old Bennett has 1,158 tackles and 63 1/2  
sacks. His 23 fumble recoveries are fourth most in NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't expect to get released by Atlanta. I thought they  
would renegotiate my deal, but they had their reasons,'' he said. 
``When I knew Bill Polian wanted me, there was no doubt in my mind 
where I wanted to be. You look at his history and look at my 
history for success. ... I'm still one of the best in the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bratzke, 27, is a former walk-on at Eastern Kentucky who was  
drafted by the New York Giants as a fifth-rounder in 1994. He 
started 42 of 50 games for the Giants and was second on the team in 
sacks with 11 last season. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Indianapolis quarterback Peyton Manning was active in  
his recruitment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The quarterback situation was one of the big things I  
considered.'' he said. ``We had tough times at the position with 
the Giants.''

<HEADLINE> Court To Consider Pollution Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to use a  
clean-water dispute from South Carolina to clarify how far private 
citizens can pursue lawsuits against polluters. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's eventual decision, expected sometime in 2000, is  
likely to carry great practical importance for environmentalists 
and the companies they sue over violations of the federal Clean 
Water Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Three environmental groups -- Friends of the Earth, Citizens  
Local Environmental Action Network and the Sierra Club -- sued 
Laidlaw Environmental Services in 1992 over its operation of a 
hazardous waste incinerator in Roebuck, S.C., that discharged 
wastewater into North Tyger River. 
</P>
<P>
	The facility was closed in 1998 and is not currently in  
operation. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time a federal trial judge ruled on the lawsuit in 1997,  
Laidlaw was found to have come into compliance with the Clean Water 
Act. So the judge ruled that the environmental groups were not 
entitled to any injunctive relief. Laidlaw was ordered, however, to 
pay $405,800 in civil penalties for past violations. 
</P>
<P>
	The environmental groups appealed, contending that the penalties  
were inadequate. Laidlaw also appealed, arguing that the groups 
could not pursue any litigation over civil penalties once 
injunctive relief was denied. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last July that the  
judge's denial of injunctive relief had made the whole case moot -- 
thwarting any further attempts to get the civil penalties 
increased. The $405,800 award was left intact, however. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court relied heavily on a decision in which the  
Supreme Court last year killed a citizens group's lawsuit against a 
Chicago steel company that missed a federal deadline for filing 
reports on its use of hazardous chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the three  
environmental groups argued that the appeals court misapplied the 
1998 Supreme Court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal said the 4th Circuit court's rationale could thwart  
the imposition of civil penalties altogether in the many cases that 
drag on so long that polluters comply with the law by the time a 
judge rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Friends of the Earth vs. Laidlaw Environmental  
Services, 98-822.

<HEADLINE> Journalist Eugene Levin Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Eugene Levin, who covered the terrorist attack at  
the 1972 Munich Olympics and other major stories during a 
quarter-century with The Associated Press, died Monday after a 
battle with cancer. He was 71. 
</P>
<P>
	In three decades following World War II, Levin worked in Europe  
and Asia as a correspondent and editor reporting on international 
news stories. 
</P>
<P>
	He covered four U.S. presidents, four popes, three Olympic  
games, the four-year Vatican Ecumenical Council and countless other 
events ranging from international strife and politics to scientific 
conferences and movie scandals. 
</P>
<P>
	Levin, a Denver native, began his career as a part-time  
correspondent for The Denver Post and the AP. 
</P>
<P>
	He was drafted in 1945 and a year later began working for Stars  
and Stripes, the military newspaper. His job included coverage of 
the war crimes trial of top Nazi leaders in Nuremberg. 
</P>
<P>
	He worked in the Chicago Tribune's Paris bureau for three years  
and joined the AP in 1950, working in New York, New Delhi, Rome, 
Tokyo and London over the next 24 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Levin was supervising editor for the 1960 Olympic Games at Rome,  
the 1964 Olympic Games at Innsbruck and the 1972 Olympic Games at 
Munich. 
</P>
<P>
	He wrote the first news bulletins from Munich when Arab  
terrorists took Israeli athletes hostage. The siege ended with the 
deaths of 11 Israelis, German policemen and five terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
	Levin also reported on President Eisenhower's visits to Pakistan  
and Greece, President Kennedy's visit to Italy and President 
Nixon's visit to London. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1974, Levin retired and settled in Denver, where he assisted  
his father in an importing business until 1992. Levin also taught 
journalism courses part-time for 24 years at the University of 
Denver until 1997, when he retired again. 
</P>
<P>
	He came out of retirement briefly in 1993 to help the Denver AP  
bureau cover the Colorado visit of Pope John Paul II. 
</P>
<P>
	Levin is survived by his wife of 46 years, Barbara Tigay Saposs,  
two daughters, Beth and Amy, two sons, Stephen and Walter, and 
three grandchildren.

<P>
	MOSUL, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq claimed today that U.S. airstrikes in  
the northern region damaged an Iraq-Turkey oil pipeline for the 
second time in two days. The line to the southern Turkish port of 
Ceyhan is the only functioning pipeline in Iraq and one of only two 
outlets for oil exports. U.S. Air Force jets dropped more than 30 
bombs on Iraqi military installations today after the F-15 fighters 
were targeted by Iraqi radar, Air Force Capt. Mike Blass of the 
U.S. European Command said. U.S. and British planes have been

Zhu Rongji's upcoming visit. Even as she pressed the human rights 
issue, police visited the home of dissident Miao Xihe, who 
announced that he was establishing the ``China Rights Party'' to 
promote protection of basic civil rights. Albright urged that Zhu, 
who is negotiating hard to gain Chinese membership in the World 
Trade Organization, deal with human rights and other tough issues 
such as high-technology transfers and Taiwan tensions.

	U.N. Land-Mine Treaty Takes Effect

	GENEVA (AP) -- An international treaty to ban the land mines that  
kill and maim 25,000 people each year went into effect today, but 
without the participation of United States, Russia and China. The 
treaty has been signed by 133 countries and ratified by 66 of them. 
It commits them to ban the production, use, stocks and exports of 
anti-personnel mines. President Clinton has set 2006 as a target

computer security controls. ``The IRS cannot do some of the basic 
accounting and record-keeping tasks that it expects American 
taxpayers to do,'' said Gregory Kutz, who oversaw the audit by the

H. Rehnquist described the current federal law that permits people 
who suffer intentional discrimination to collect punitive damages 
as ``simply confusing.'' The justices are reviewing a lower court

<HEADLINE> U.N. Land-Mine Treaty Takes Effect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- An international treaty to ban land mines which  
kill and maim some 25,000 people each year entered into force 
today, heralded by a low-key ceremony at the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty, concluded in Ottawa in 1997, has been signed by 133  
countries and ratified by 64 of them. About 12 countries have 
destroyed their entire stocks of land mines. 
</P>
<P>
	Major users and producers -- including the United States, Russia  
and China -- have refused to join in. And even with the treaty, it 
will take still take decades to clear the tens of millions of mines 
scattered in more than 60 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``The battle ahead is to make this treaty full effective not  
just in law but also in implementation,'' U.N. Secretary-General 
Kofi Annan said in a message to the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not just in the capitals of the signatories but also in the  
fields and forests where mines still exist; not just in principle 
but in practice,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Underlining the problems, two children were killed and six  
others seriously wounded when a land mine exploded in northern 
Rwanda, Rwandan radio reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty, agreed to after a massive campaign by charities  
working with victims, commits signatories to ban production, use, 
stocks and exports of land mines. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has set 2006 as a target for joining the  
accord -- saying the United States needs to use mines until then

	Susan Walker, coordinator of the International Campaign to Ban  
Land Mines -- which won the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize -- said her group 
would this year focus its campaign on the Middle East and former 
Soviet Union to try to persuade them to go along with the accord. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause also was supported by the late Princess Diana. Diana  
drew attention to the issue by making a highly publicized walk 
through a minefield in Angola in February 1997. She died in a car 
crash in Paris on Aug. 31 of that year.

<HEADLINE> Study Says Light Trucks Are Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Officials at the National Highway Traffic Safety  
Administration say more research is needed to determine what can be 
done to make so-called light trucks less dangerous in collisions 
with cars after releasing their latest crash test report. 
</P>
<P>
	Sport utility vehicles, pickups and minivans pose a greater risk  
of injury and death to drivers and passengers in cars, according to 
the report, released Monday 
</P>
<P>
	The government agency conducted four tests involving offset  
front-end crashes between a 1997 Honda Accord and four other 
vehicles: a 1998 Chevrolet S-10 compact pickup; a 1997 Dodge 
Caravan minivan; a 1997 Ford Explorer SUV; and a 1997 Chevrolet 
Lumina sedan. 
</P>
<P>
	In nearly every injury measurement, the driver dummy in the  
Accord sustained greater injuries in 35-mph crashes with the 
pickup, minivan and SUV than it did in a crash with the other 
sedan. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were similar to those of last year's side-impact  
crash tests involving the same models. 
</P>
<P>
	The Accord dummy in the front passenger seat sustained greater  
injuries when the car was struck by the minivan and SUV. But injury 
measurements were higher when the Accord was struck by the Lumina 
than they were when the car was struck by the pickup. The midsize 
Lumina is heavier than the S-10. 
</P>
<P>
	Light trucks generally are heavier, ride higher and have stiffer  
frames than cars, which means more energy in a crash is transferred 
to the car in an accident. Regulators have been increasingly 
worried about this mismatch between light trucks and cars as trucks 
have become more common on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Light trucks now account for nearly half of all new vehicles  
sold in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert C. Lange, engineering director of vehicle development for  
General Motors Corp., noted that with one exception, the dummies in 
all the vehicles sustained survivable injuries despite the severity 
of the crashes -- including the Honda's occupants. 
</P>
<P>
	``This series of crash tests does not appear to show there's a  
huge crash-compatibility problem between cars and light trucks,'' 
Lange said. ``It seems to prove, once again, that physics work: The 
occupants of the heavier vehicles are going to fare better than the 
occupants of a lighter vehicle in a collision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a related study released Monday at the Society of Automotive  
Engineers' annual convention, the University of Michigan's 
Transportation Research Institute found that being struck by a 
light truck is worse than being struck by a car of the same weight. 
That's true whether it's a front-end or side-impact crash, the 
study said. 
</P>
<P>
	That study, based on actual crash data, determined that about  
twice as many car drivers are killed in car-light truck collisions 
than in similar collisions between cars, in which the other car was 
of the same weight as the light truck. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, the study estimates, at least 2,000 car occupants would  
not have died had their cars collided with other cars instead of 
light trucks of the same weight. 
</P>
<P>
	Lange said such a claim ``is a pretty significant  
oversimplification of the facts'' that does not take into account 
the safety benefit that SUVs and other light trucks provide their 
occupants. Nor, he said, does it consider the increased threat to 
those riding in light trucks if those vehicles are designed more 
like cars.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Conglomerate Has Huge Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- A conglomerate owned by a southern Chinese  
provincial government said Monday it lost billions of dollars and 
owes billions more. But after an emergency meeting with bankers, 
officials came out with a pledge to keep the group afloat for now. 
</P>
<P>
	That was welcome news to some of the bankers, who have gotten  
themselves in trouble with billions in bad loans on the mainland, 
though others grumbled privately that the commitments they received 
were not enough. 
</P>
<P>
	The bankers have been nervously watching the situation at  
Guangdong Enterprises (Holdings) Ltd. since its troubles became 
apparent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Guangdong Enterprises revealed at a news conference Monday that  
it lost $2.4 billion in the first nine months of 1998 and has debts 
of $2.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The provincial Guangdong government has been injecting funds to  
keep the conglomerate in business, while auditors and advisers go 
through its books and try to streamline its operations. 
</P>
<P>
	A debt restructuring plan is not expected until April at the  
earliest, said representatives from Goldman Sachs, who were 
appointed to supervise the conglomerate's restructuring. By that 
time, creditors should know whether they have to substantially 
write down or write off some of the debts. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the Guangdong government ``is committed to keeping the  
group trading and being liquid,'' said Steve Shafron, Goldman 
Sachs' managing director in Hong Kong. He said the group has some 
solid and profitable businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Guangdong Enterprises sits at the center of a tangled web of  
companies with investments in a variety of industries, including 
brewing, textiles, construction and food. 
</P>
<P>
	Guangdong Enterprises is the parent of Hong Kong-listed  
Guangdong Investment and Guangnan Enterprises (Holdings) Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	In sharp contrast to the situation at Guangdong Enterprises, the  
Guangdong government allowed another huge group, Guangdong 
International Trust and Investment Corp., also known as Gitic, the 
province's main investment arm, to go bankrupt earlier this year, 
sending shock waves through the financial community. 
</P>
<P>
	Guangdong's executive vice governor, Wang Qishan, said the  
government has decided to save Guangdong Enterprises, and not 
Gitic, because a collapse of Guangdong Enterprises would have hurt 
the Hong Kong stock market, where its affiliates are listed.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Man Nabbed in Missile Plot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A Chinese man was arrested in California, accused  
of trying to buy equipment vital to missile guidance systems and 
smuggle it to his homeland, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Yao Yi tried to buy fiber optic gyroscopes from a Massachusetts  
defense contractor, according to a criminal complaint filed in 
federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials said China was bidding to enhance the accuracy  
of its long-range weapons with the high-tech American equipment, 
whose export is rigidly limited by the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
	After the State Department refused to approve the sale, Yao  
allegedly arranged for the export of the gyroscopes with another 
Boston company -- actually a dummy corporation set up for a U.S. 
Customs Service sting operation, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Yao was arrested at a fiber optics conference in San Diego last  
Tuesday. At a hearing Friday in San Diego, he agreed to be brought 
to Boston to face charges, Assistant U.S. Attorney Despena F. 
Billings said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The other suspect, Collin Xu, had been arrested Feb. 11 in  
Boston. Xu, a naturalized Canadian citizen who lives in Montreal, 
faces charges that include violations of the Arms Export Control 
Act, conspiracy and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	Gyroscopes are used in navigational systems for, among other  
things, missiles, ``smart'' bombs and aircraft guidance systems. 
They also can be used to stabilize platforms for weapons systems, 
the U.S. attorney's office said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Department told Congress last week that China is  
decades away from being able to defeat a modern military force 
beyond its borders. But the Pentagon said China's cruise and 
ballistics missiles still give it the ability to attain military 
and political goals through intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright arrived in the  
Chinese capital, Beijing, on Sunday and was expected to criticize 
China's missile stockpiling.

<HEADLINE> IOC Told To Police Members, Bidders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An ethics committee Monday blamed the Olympic  
bribery scandal on leaders who turned a blind eye to corruption 
that was ``flourishing'' even as the games grew into a 
billion-dollar empire. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel, headed by former Senate Majority Leader George  
Mitchell, urged the International Olympic Committee to run its 
games like a modern business -- instead of an inbred, unethical 
group that fostered a ``culture of improper gift-giving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In unusually harsh language for the international sports  
hierarchy, the report said the IOC had fostered ``this mess'' and 
shifted the focus of picking Olympic cities from sports to 
ever-bigger, more blatant presents for committee members. 
</P>
<P>
	``We called this `gift-creep,''' Mitchell said at a news  
conference. ``Gradually, what started with small, legitimate items 
evolved into scholarships and then direct payments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It said the conduct ``tolerated by the IOC is potentially  
illegal and inevitably corruptive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC should no sooner tolerate improper gifts by candidate  
cities to its members than it would tolerate such gifts by athletes 
to judges,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the report did not call for IOC president Juan Antonio  
Samaranch to resign, instead urging that the whole system be 
reformed. 
</P>
<P>
	``If President Samaranch and the entire leadership of the IOC  
retires tomorrow and there were no other changes, the problems of 
the IOC would continue, '' Mitchell said. ``If they continue in 
office, then everyone ... has a right to expect they will institute 
structural change promptly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Benz, a commission member and former champion figure  
skater, said the Mitchell panel was especially disturbed by ``the 
prevalence of a culture in which it was acceptable to request 
things of value while making a decision involving the people from 
whom you were requesting things of value.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It became apparent that the objectionable conduct was  
inextricably intertwined with the system,'' Benz said in an 
interview. ``That system led bid cities to gift-giving that made 
the strengths of their sports system secondary to caring for the 
preferences of individual IOC members.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only one party was always there, the report said.  
</P>
<P>
	``While candidate cities have come and gone in the past decade,  
the one constant in the culture of improper gift giving has been 
the IOC,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the third investigation to report on the scandal, in  
which members of Salt Lake's bid committee offered a million 
dollars in cash, scholarships and other gifts to IOC members and 
their relatives in exchange for awarding the 2002 Winter Games to 
the Utah city. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike earlier findings by the IOC and the Salt Lake Organizing  
Committee, it delivered no blockbuster revelations, focusing 
instead on what needed to be changed. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel said Olympic leaders at every level were responsible  
for the scandal and said reforms were needed from top to bottom to 
avoid a recurrence. 
</P>
<P>
	But in 63 pages summarizing its two-month investigation and  
making recommendations for future bids, the commission aimed 
squarely at the IOC and said it needed to take quick and drastic 
action. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake's misconduct, Mitchell said, was ``part of a broader  
culture of improper gift-giving in which candidate cities provided 
things of value to IOC members in an effort to buy their votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This culture was made possible by the closed nature of the IOC  
and by the absence of ethical and transparent financial controls of 
its operation. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not excuse or condone those from Salt Lake City who did  
the giving. What they did was wrong. But ... they did not invent 
this culture; they joined one that was already flourishing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report suggested a series of changes, from severe limits on  
bid-city gifts and expenses to opening the IOC's books and having 
the bulk of its members elected to limited terms by others in the 
sports community. The IOC traditionally picks its own members to 
virtual life terms. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also called on the IOC to require that any country  
bidding for the games sign the international treaty against 
bribery. And it urged the White House to bring the IOC under 
coverage of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits 
bribing of foreign government officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission, working mostly from public records and news  
reports, did not examine Olympic bids other than Salt Lake's, and 
Mitchell pointedly refused to comment on possible improprieties in 
successful Summer Games bids by Atlanta for 1996 and Sydney for 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the IOC should have paid more attention to a 1991  
report from Toronto's losing bid for the 1996 Games, which detailed 
abuses of the gift and travel rules by a string of unidentified 
committee members. 
</P>
<P>
	``In strikingly prophetic language, they warned of the  
consequences of such improper behavior,'' the report said. ``The 
Toronto prophesy has come true. As a result, credibility of the 
Olympic movement has been gravely damaged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benz said the Toronto report ``provided notice to the IOC. ...  
It showed the IOC had knowledge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC had no immediate response to the Mitchell report. It's  
chief investigator, vice president Dick Pound, said he had not seen 
the report but that most of the recommendations sounded as if they 
should be considered. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pound said he disagreed with saying that the IOC was rife  
with corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't accept that as a broad-brush description,'' he said,  
adding that gift giving was part of the culture of many members of 
the international organization. ``I don't accept the word 
`improper.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound also said that some of the recommendations in the Toronto  
report had been adopted by the IOC, including coordination of 
travel to bid cities. But he conceded that the committee could have 
been more alert to signs of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we're paying for that,'' he said. ``We're going to get the  
genie back in the bottle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mitchell panel is an independent watchdog for the U.S.  
Olympic Committee, which was criticized in the report for a lack of 
oversight of staff members and the Salt Lake bidders. It 
specifically cited the case of Alfredo la Mont, who resigned as 
USOC international relations director after revealing he did 
consulting work for Salt Lake bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also recommended changes in USOC bid rules and  
tighter reins on international sports assistance programs. While it 
said such programs were generally proper and should continue, it 
noted that one was misused to help Salt Lake bidders influence 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
	A USOC statement said the panel produced a ``thorough report and  
thoughtful recommendations'' that would improve future Olympics. 
USOC president Bill Hybl is scheduled to make a full response at a 
Washington news conference Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC chairman Robert Garff called the commission's  
recommendations ``a step in the right direction. ... Hopefully, the 
(bidding) process will have changed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell said he hoped the IOC would give ``serious  
consideration'' to his commission's recommendations, and that he 
watch closely when the committee holds a special session on the 
scandal March 17-18. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will be an early measure of the IOC's resolve to make  
changes and reforms,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Atlanta organizers repeated that they did nothing wrong in  
their bid for the 1996 Games, even though they exceeded spending 
limits on gifts for IOC officials. ``We won the games for Atlanta 
by establishing friendships -- that was our primary strategy from 
day one,'' former Atlanta Olympics chief Billy Payne said. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Pound said the fate of at least 13 IOC members under  
investigation in the Salt Lake scandal should be announced by the 
end of the week. He said his five-member commission was trying to 
reach a consensus on all of the cases and was now dealing with an 
additional six IOC members linked to the scandal by a Utah ethics 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Senate Commerce Committee said it would hold hearings on  
the Olympic scandal next month. Neither a witness list nor an exact 
date have been set. The committee, headed by Arizona's John McCain, 
could consider legislation stripping the IOC's tax-exempt status. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The scandal has had little impact on the public's feelings  
about the Olympics, according to the Gallup Poll. A survey of 1,013 
Americans conducted over the weekend found 75 percent said their 
respect for the games had declined only a little or not at all 
because of the Salt Lake case.

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- David McAdam Eccles, a patrician who was  
instrumental in creating the British Library but never achieved his 
ambitions for high political office, died Wednesday at age 94. 
</P>
<P>
	Eccles was elevated to the House of Lords after he being  
dismissed from Harold Macmillan's Conservative government in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Eccles served as paymaster general in Edward Heath's  
government in 1970, his hopes for high office ended when Macmillan 
dismissed seven ministers in a dramatic effort to boost his 
drifting government. 
</P>
<P>
	Macmillan's successor, Alec Douglas-Home, gave Eccles a  
hereditary title as Viscount Eccles in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	Serving as Heath's arts minister, Eccles took the lead in  
separating the library from the British Museum, combining it with 
the National Central Library and the National Lending Library for 
Science and Technology to create the British Library. He served as 
the first chairman of the British Library Board from 1973-78. 
</P>
<P>
	Eccles served as economic adviser to the British embassies in  
Madrid, Spain and Lisbon, Portugal in 1940-42. He was elected to a 
vacant seat in the House of Commons in 1943. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1952-53 when he was minister of works, Eccles supervised  
preparations for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. He was 
knighted in 1954.

	Gerhardt joined the technical staff of RCA Victor in 1950, and  
by the early 1960s, was overseeing RCA's productions in London. 
</P>
<P>
	His first major project as a producer was ``A Festival of Light  
Classical Music,'' in 1960. A year later, he produced a Beethoven 
cycle that has become a collector's item. 
</P>
<P>
	He formed an orchestra of London musicians in 1964. It was  
incorporated as the National Philharmonic Orchestra in 1970. 
Gerhardt conducted it on recordings of contemporary pieces and 
standard repertory works. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerhardt was best known for his collection of film scores that  
included volumes devoted to the works of Max Steiner, Franz Waxman, 
Miklow Rozsa, Alfred Newman, Bernard Hermann and John Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	He produced ``The Sea Hawk'' in 1972 and was the first major  
overview of Erich Korngold's film music. In 1975, Gerhardt produced 
the first recording of the Korngold's opera, ``Die Tote Stadt.''

	PLEASANTVILLE, N.J. (AP) -- Betty Roche, a singer who performed  
with Duke Ellington in the 1940's and 50's, died Feb. 16 at age 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Mary Elizabeth Roche, she sang with the Savoy Sultans in  
1941, before joining Ellington two years later. She scored high 
marks from critics for the suite ``Black, Brown and Beige,'' at 
Ellington's first Carnegie Hall concert. 
</P>
<P>
	Her feature of the ``Blues'' sequence, was meant to express the  
feelings of blacks who settled into urban life in the start of the 
20th century. The song became one of Ellington's greatest pieces 
for a singer. 
</P>
<P>
	She also performed Ellington's signature song ``Take the A  
Train'' in the 1943 film ``Reveille With Beverly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Roche also performed and recorded with the pianist Earl  
Hines, the trumpeter Clark Terry and singer and pianist Charles 
Brown.

	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Ken Robinson, a baseball player who was  
trying to make it back to the big leagues with the Arizona 
Diamondbacks, was killed early Sunday in a car accident. He was 29. 
</P>
<P>
	He suffered severe head injuries when a car driven by a fellow  
minor leaguer careened off a road and overturned. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver, pitcher John Rosengren, was charged with  
second-degree murder in what police say was an alcohol-related 
crash. Rosengren was not seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson had been a part of the Diamondbacks' 40-man roster in  
spring training a year ago, but missed the season because of 
shoulder surgery. He and Rosengren were awaiting the opening of the 
Diamondbacks' minor league training camp. 
</P>

	Robinson had brief big league stints as a relief pitcher with  
Toronto in 1995 and 1997, and with Kansas City in 1996.

<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Hughie Lee-Smith, a painter and former  
teacher at the Art Students League in New York, died Feb. 23 of 
cancer. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee-Smith was known for his paintings that frequently included  
symbolic figurative scenes. His works often included settings 
suggestive of theater stages or bleak urban or seaside landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1953, he won a prize for his work from the Detroit Institute  
of Arts. 
</P>
<P>
	While serving in the Navy he did a mural titled, ``History of  
the Negro in the U.S. Navy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He taught at the Art Students League for 15 years, beginning in  
1958. In 1963, he became the second black member elected to the 
National Academy of Design in New York City. He became a full 
member four years later. 
</P>
<P>
	His paintings are in many public collections, including the  
Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Detroit Institute of Arts, the 
National Gallery of Art in Washington and the Schomburg Center for 
Research in Black Culture in New York City.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Michael St. Clair, an art dealer who helped  
bring public attention to the work of once-overlooked painters 
including Alfred Maurer, Childe Hassam and Marsden Hartley, died 
Monday. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Clair, who was director of the Babcock Galleries for 40  
years, used his influence in the New York art world to promote many 
unsung artists. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1959, he took possession of Hartley's estate from dealer Paul  
Rosenberg, who had been unable to generate interest in the 
painter's work. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next two decades, St. Clair organized 11 Hartley  
exhibitions and eventually sold the artists' paintings to nearly 70 
museums. The Whitney Museum of American Art put on a Hartley 
retrospective in 1978.

Osborne four straight years -- 1943-46. 
</P>
<P>
	Talbert teamed with Tony Trabert, another Hall of Famer, to win  
both the French and Italian doubles titles in 1950, and was U.S. 
Davis Cup captain from 1953-57, defeating Australia to win the Cup 
in 1954. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	Originally founded in 1950 as The Jasper Corp., Kimball has

</P>
<P>
	Kimball International, as it became known in 1974, makes pianos,  
home and office furniture, television and audio cabinets, 
electronic assemblies, molded plastics, carbide cutting tools and

<HEADLINE> Linda Tripp To Return to Pentagon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Linda Tripp will return to the Pentagon this  
week, but to a different job than the one she had a year ago when 
her secret tape recordings triggered the Monica Lewinsky scandal, 
two people familiar with the matter said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning Wednesday, Mrs. Tripp will be a public affairs  
specialist in the Defense Department's Manpower Data Center, said 
the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp was informed of the change Monday at a Pentagon  
meeting with her supervisor, Doug Wilson, the principal deputy 
assistant secretary of defense for public affairs, one of the 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Army Col. Richard Bridges, the Pentagon's director of defense  
information, confirmed the meeting, but said he had no other 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Coughter, a spokesman for Mrs. Tripp, declined to comment  
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp was director of the high-profile Joint Civilian  
Orientation Conference in January 1998 when she turned over to 
prosecutor Kenneth Starr tapes of Ms. Lewinsky discussing a planned 
cover-up of her affair with President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp's orientation program in the secretary of defense's  
office brought together opinion leaders from across the nation to 
familiarize them with activities of all the military services. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp has been working from home, keeping her nearly  
$90,000 salary, since the scandal broke. 
</P>
<P>
	The 19-year federal employee has had a difficult relationship  
with her employer, declaring she wanted to remain at her work 
station at the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon concluded her presence would be disruptive to the  
Defense Department, so she was assigned to put together a training 
manual from home.

<HEADLINE> Japan Vehicle Sales Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Sales of new Japanese cars, trucks and buses fell  
9.9 percent in February from a year earlier, a trade group said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline to 357,485 marked the 23rd consecutive month of  
declines, the Japan Automobile Dealers' Association said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of passenger cars fell 5.4 percent compared to a year ago,  
to 265,585, while truck sales slid 21.2 percent to 90,748. Bus 
sales bucked the trend, rising 7.7 percent to 1,152. 
</P>
<P>
	All of Japan's 11 major automakers posted lower sales in  
February. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's largest automaker, Toyota Motor Corp., posted a 4.4  
percent decline on the year to 150,981 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 2-ranked Nissan Motor Co. saw a 16.4 percent slump in sales  
to 73,988 and Honda Motor Co.'s sales dropped 8 percent to 32,727 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, sales of imported vehicles rose 3.1 percent on the  
year to 22,811 in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Vehicle sales in Japan are unlikely to rebound in the next few  
months, said a spokesman for the dealer's association. He noted 
there are few signs of a recovery in the broader economy.

<HEADLINE> Berra Visits Yankees' Spring Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The reconciliation between Yogi Berra and  
George Steinbrenner took another step forward Monday, with Berra 
making his first-ever appearance at the New York Yankees' Legends 
Field complex. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tremendous. It's a great feeling,'' said Steinbrenner,  
who wants Berra at the regular-season home opener against Detroit 
on April 9. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes it a great spring,'' Steinbrenner said. ``Now, if we  
can get Joe D. (DiMaggio) to pull through, it will (really be) a 
great spring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees' owner escorted Berra to the Yankees' clubhouse 25  
minutes before an intraaquad game. The Hall of Fame catcher then 
sat between manager Joe Torre and coach Don Zimmer near the 
first-base dugout for most of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The visit was another milestone since Steinbrenner apologized  
two months ago for firing Berra as Yankees manager in April 1985. 
Berra has not been back to the ballpark for a Yankees game since. 
</P>
<P>
	``He called, he wanted to apologize and he said the right thing.  
If he didn't, I wouldn't be here,'' Berra said. 
</P>
<P>
	He wouldn't commit to the home opener but made clear he's likely  
to appear., 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll see what happens,'' Berra said, adding, ``Let's keep it  
a secret.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre would also like Berra to take part in the World Series  
ring presentation ceremony, likely to take place April 11. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's over with and that's good news,'' Torre said of the feud.  
``It's nice to know we're going to be seeing him again. I think 
this sort of makes it official for me. It's great ... it's 
wonderful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berra, in Tampa for Tuesday's meeting of the Hall of Fame  
veterans' committee, also sat with Steinbrenner in the owner's 
office during the seven-inning game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He should be part of the organization. He belongs around,''  
Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said. ``It's the way it 
should be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several players, including center fielder Bernie Williams, made  
sure they met Berra. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time you get a chance to meet somebody like that, it's  
great. How can you say no to that?'' Williams said. ``They were the 
guys who made the Yankees what they are today. We're just trying to 
carry it on.' 
</P>
<P>
	Berra said he has not talked with Joe DiMaggio since his former  
teammate was released from the hospital following cancer surgery, 
but did speak with Dom DiMaggio last month at the Ted Williams 
museum. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said one day he (Joe) feels good, one day he doesn't,''  
Berra said. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Andy Pettitte reported no problems after throwing 36  
pitches Monday during his first batting practice stint. The 
left-hander, who has been slowed by elbow tenderness, is scheduled 
to pitch against Minnesota on Sunday ... Cashman said there is 
nothing new to report on contract talks with the agents for Jorge 
Posada, Ramiro Mendoza, Ricky Ledee, and Shane Spencer. ... Derek 
Jeter was hit in the leg by a Ryan Bradley pitch during the 
intrasquad game, but was not hurt. ... Minor league prospect Luis 
DeLosSantos struck out Chuck Knoblauch and Jeter on called third 
strikes. .. Former-Yankee Homer Bush agreed to a $225,000, one-year 
contract with Toronto.
