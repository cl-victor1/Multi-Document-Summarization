<HEADLINE> Nabisco Earnings Drop 35 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARSIPPANY, N.J. (AP) -- Declining sales and restructuring costs  
fueled a 35 percent drop in first-quarter earnings for food 
conglomerate Nabisco Holdings Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The results reported Wednesday by the maker of Oreo cookies,  
Ritz crackers, Life Savers candy and Planters nuts were in line 
with Wall Street expectations. But its shares fell 56 1/4 cents to 
$39.87 1/2 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Nabisco earned $36 million, or 13 cents a share, for the  
January-March period versus $55 million, or 21 cents a share, a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The lower results reflected $15 million in pre-tax expenses for  
restructuring programs begun in June and December of last year. 
That trimmed 4 cents a share from the reported earnings figure. 
</P>
<P>
	Without that expense, Nabisco's earnings of 17 cents a share  
matched the average expected by analysts surveyed by First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales declined 6 percent to $1.85 billion from $1.96 billion in  
the year-ago quarter, although sales from ongoing businesses rose 1 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Increased sales in Nabisco's U.S. biscuits, snacks and grocery  
products businesses were offset by a 5 percent drop in 
international sales, due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates in 
Brazil and Canada, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Biscuit company sales, including core cookie brands such as  
Oreo, Chips Ahoy! and Nutter Butter, increased 2 percent driven by 
product promotions. 
</P>
<P>
	Nabisco said sales from ongoing U.S. food businesses increased 7  
percent led by significant gains for Planters nuts and Life Savers 
candies. However, the division's total sales fell 18 percent 
because the absence of divested brands like College Inn broths, 
margarine and Egg Beaters. 
</P>
<P>
	International sales declined 5 percent. The company said gains  
in Mexico, the Caribbean and Asia were not enough to offset 
declines in a number of Latin American markets caused by economic 
uncertainty and the impact of unfavorable currency rates.

<HEADLINE> Avalanche, Rockies Postpone Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- In a city mourning the shooting deaths of students  
at a suburban high school, the Colorado Avalanche on Wednesday 
postponed their opening two NHL playoff games and the Colorado 
Rockies called off a second straight baseball game. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing ownership sentiment that ``we have to act like all these  
kids are our kids,'' Avalanche general manager Pierre Lacroix said 
his team and the San Jose Sharks will not play the first two games 
of their best-of-7 series on Wednesday night and Thursday night 
here as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the series will open on Saturday in San Jose, which  
originally was to be Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Game 2 will be in San Jose on Monday, with the series shifting  
to Denver for games on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday of that week. 
Game 6, if necessary, would be the following Monday in San Jose, 
and Game 7 would be back in Denver -- on a date yet to be 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's our way to show respect to the community for this tragic  
situation,'' Lacroix said. ``I want to express on behalf of the 
Avalanche our support to the families and express how sorry we feel 
for all of them. Our prayers are with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lacroix said he began discussing scheduling alternatives with  
owner Charlie Lyons and NHL officials on Tuesday night, just hours 
after the extent of the shooting, which left 15 dead and two dozen 
injured, became known. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a conversation with Charlie Lyons and his reaction was  
that we are close to this community and we have to act like all 
these kids are our kids,'' Lacroix said. ``With the support of the 
San Jose Sharks organization, we agreed to start the series in San 
Jose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Avalanche still would host four games of the  
seven-game series, the sometimes pivotal first two games will be 
staged in San Jose instead of Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if that amounts to a disadvantage for his team, Lacroix  
said, ``We thought about the hockey aspect, but there is nothing 
more important than showing respect for our community. We don't 
look at this in any way, shape or form as an advantage or a 
disadvantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The uncertainty about the date for Game 7 is because of  
potential arena and television conflicts, Lacroix said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharks general manager Dean Lombardi agreed with the decision to  
reschedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's any way we could have played (Wednesday  
night),'' he said. ``From what I understand, the bodies are still 
in there (the school). We talked about starting Thursday night, and 
we threw that out. I don't see how you could play here on Saturday 
either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNichols Arena is unavailable on Friday because of a Nuggets  
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's enough time for both teams to adjust,''  
Lombardi said. ``Once we have all regrouped and started on 
Saturday, we'll go from there, so there is no competitive edge. 
There might be an effect if it goes to Game 7. The team going into 
the second round might have a disadvantage'' because of fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
	Avalanche forward Claude Lemieux wondered aloud if playing the  
games as scheduled ``might have provided some distraction and 
helped more than just offering our prayers and thoughts. I don't 
know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux, who lives 20 minutes from the school, said ``the more  
they were showing on TV, the more faces I would recognize. I went 
to pick up my car (Tuesday), and the service manager said his 
daughter was at the school. Everybody was terrified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Odgers noted there are ``a lot of fathers in this (locker)  
room. You send your kid off to school, and it's supposed to be the 
best years of your life, especially in high school. Nobody should 
have to go through what those people are going through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharks goalie Mike Vernon applauded the decision to postpone.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was the right thing to do,'' he said. ``This hit too close  
to home for me. I can't imagine what the people in the Denver area 
and the families involved are going through. It's going to affect 
people for the rest of their lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Coors Field, the Rockies postponed Wednesday's game against  
Montreal, just as it had postponed Tuesday's. The teams will play 
two split doubleheaders when the Expos return to Denver Aug. 13-15, 
but the exact dates of the doubleheaders haven't been set. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are deeply saddened by the events in Littleton yesterday,  
and now is not the time to play baseball,'' Rockies vice chairman 
Charlie Monfort said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies open a four-game series in San Francisco on  
Thursday. Team officials said players and coaches will wear a 
Columbine High School patch on their right sleeves for the 
remainder of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Montreal manager Felipe Alou agreed with the postponements.  
</P>
<P>
	``We aren't in Chicago or Miami or Los Angeles,'' Alou said.  
``We are right next door to where this thing happened and where 
there are still bodies inside the school. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it will cause some inconvenience having to play two  
doubleheaders in August. But it is more important that we put some 
time between us and this incident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alou recalled his playing days in 1968 when games were  
interrupted by the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert 
Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't play three days when I was a player with the Braves  
and we were in Chicago,'' Alou said. ``I know Senator Kennedy was a 
great American, but he was one man. What have they found, 13 or so 
dead? And right here in town. When Martin Luther King was 
assassinated, we didn't play for a number of days and that was at 
the beginning of the season.''

<HEADLINE> Gov't Details Kid's Online Privacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is laying plans for enforcing a  
new law that bans companies from collecting personal information 
from children on the Internet without a parent's permission. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission's proposed rules, announced  
Tuesday, would require operators of commercial Web sites to make 
``reasonable efforts'' in most cases to obtain consent from parents 
before asking children under 13 for their names, addresses, 
telephone numbers or other identifying details. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules also would prohibit a company from enticing children  
with online games or prizes into disclosing ``more personal 
information than is reasonably necessary.'' They will be adopted 
after a 45-day public comment period and will take effect next 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	But the agency didn't suggest in its rules how companies should  
contact parents for permission -- such as by e-mail or fax -- saying 
only that it ``must be reasonably calculated, in light of available 
technology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky said the agency sought to give  
control to parents over information about their kids, while also 
offering flexibility to different businesses on the Internet and to 
new technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``The FTC, quite properly, left that open,'' said Ronald  
Plesser, an attorney who worked with the Direct Marketing 
Association and other groups. ``I think there will be a range of 
mechanisms. The beauty of technology is that today's problem is 
maybe an easy solution tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problems facing regulators involve the faceless nature of  
the Internet, where children often know more about the technology 
than their parents and can easily impersonate an adult with a few 
mouse clicks. 
</P>
<P>
	The government wants to protect children's privacy, but not  
through regulations so onerous they might discourage children from 
using the Internet or hinder the extraordinary potential for 
electronic commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	``Parental consent is the key provision,'' said Katharina Kopp,  
a policy expert at the Washington-based Center for Media Education, 
which lobbied for the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, 
passed by Congress last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without that, the whole legislation is really quite  
meaningless,'' Kopp said. ``We want the FTC to implement effective 
rules that don't create huge loopholes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The law doesn't require companies to obtain a parent's  
permission to collect a child's e-mail address to send him 
information on a one-time basis, such as a digital coupon for a 
video game. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the proposed rules don't suggest ways companies might  
contact parents, the FTC said separately in a news release that 
possibilities include use of a credit card by a parent, a toll-free 
telephone number, a form signed by a parent or e-mail with new 
digital signature technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``They seemed to anticipate this was going to be a hot potato,''  
said Jason Catlett of Junkbusters Corp., a New Jersey-based privacy 
group. ``Rather than put up something that would be shot down from 
all sides, they'll let the commentators fight it out and take what 
they see as a satisfactory compromise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rules also require companies to give parents the choice of  
whether to disclose information about their children to other 
businesses, and to review whatever details were collected from 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	The privacy law was prompted by an FTC study last year of 1,400  
Web sites, including one where children were asked to give their 
names, addresses, e-mail addresses and ages and say whether they 
ever received gifts of stocks, cash, savings bonds or certificates 
of deposit. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Vice President Al Gore hastily stripped from  
his Web site questions asking children for their names, e-mail 
addresses and zip codes after The Associated Press raised questions 
about them. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign officials maintained the questions would not have  
violated the new privacy law, which isn't yet in effect and covers 
only commercial Web sites, but they decided to remove them anyway.

<HEADLINE>  Three Top Israel Candidates Hang On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- When Centrist party candidate Yitzhak  
Mordechai came to a park to shake hands with picnicking voters on 
Israel's Independence Day, his backers were almost drowned out by 
opponents chanting, ``Bibi, Bibi.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's the nickname of Mordechai's arch rival, Prime Minister  
Benjamin Netanyahu. Mordechai, a former defense minister, quit 
Netanyahu's Cabinet in February and joined the new Centrist party 
to run against him in the May 17 election. 
</P>
<P>
	Mordechai perceived Wednesday's crowd differently. ``They're  
chanting `Itzik, Itzik','' his own nickname, he insisted. ``That's 
what you're hearing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mordechai's version of reality -- that he is the only one who can  
defeat Netanyahu -- is a nightmare for the other main candidate, 
Ehud Barak of Labor. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls show Netanyahu and Barak virtually tied with about  
one-third of the vote each, and Mordechai far behind with 17 
percent. If no candidate wins 50 percent of the vote, the top two 
finishers would face each other in a runoff June 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak's campaign managers are trying to persuade Mordechai to  
drop out and back Barak. Then, they say, Barak would defeat 
Netanyahu in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Mordechai says Barak should quit. Barak, head of Israel's oldest  
political party, rejects that as unthinkable. 
</P>
<P>
	That makes a second round almost inevitable, forcing Israeli  
politicians to enter uncharted territory. Experts say the polls may 
be misleading because the key is who will vote the second time. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor has set up a special team, headed by veteran legislator  
Haim Ramon, to start planning how to get its people to the polls 
twice in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramon's team is paying special attention to Israel's minority  
Arab sector, traditionally heavy supporters of moderate candidates 
like Barak. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor insiders fear that once the Arabs have voted for their own  
candidate, legislator Azmi Bishara, they may not bother to come 
back and vote for Barak. 
</P>
<P>
	Within Netanyahu's Likud Party, the concern is ultra-Orthodox  
Jews, who were crucial to his slim victory in 1996. Following 
instructions from their rabbis, they gave Netanyahu almost 90 
percent of their votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Likud activists worry the rabbis would be hesitant to order  
their followers away from their religious studies to vote a second 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Mordechai, meanwhile, seems intent on staying in the race, a  
pledge he made on national television during his recent debate with 
Netanyahu. 
</P>
<P>
	Waiting for Mordechai at the Independence Day picnic, Tel Aviv  
party leader Jacob Ovadia said the crucial campaign period was just 
beginning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Voters will start paying closer attention and make their  
decisions,'' he said, predicting a runoff between Mordechai and 
Netanyahu.

<HEADLINE> Men's Gymnastics Could Be Dogfight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Nebraska has the homecourt advantage for  
the NCAA men's gymnastics championships, but the Cornhuskers may 
not have the depth to bring home the title. 
</P>
<P>
	With three gymnasts out with injuries, the Huskers will try for  
their ninth title with just six competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The team race is wide open,'' Penn State coach Randy Jepson  
said. ``Nebraska is held back by a lack of depth. The team that 
wins will need to put together two great meets, back-to-back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska's Jason Hardabura says his team isn't about to give in,  
though. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what you expect from this meet,'' he said  
Wednesday's news conference, ``but I guarantee you're going to see 
a dog fight out there. It will be a battle with six teams giving 
100 percent. When Friday comes, and there's three teams left, it's 
going to be another war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska, the West Regional winner, will be going against  
top-ranked Michigan, Ohio State, Penn State, Brigham Young and 
Stanford in the six-team competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Team preliminaries will be Thursday and the top three will  
advance to Friday's finals. The all-around championship also will 
be decided Thursday, and Nebraska has two of the top five ranked 
all-arounders in Hardabura (No. 1) and junior Derek Leiter (No. 4). 
Individual event finals are Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is as good of an NCAA field that I've seen,'' Nebraska  
coach Francis Allen said. ``I watched Ohio State and Michigan 
practice, and I was very impressed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan is making its first NCAA championship appearance since  
1974. 
</P>
<P>
	Brigham Young enters the meet under a cloud. BYU coach Mako  
Satamoto recently was told the school is dropping the sport after 
next season. The announcement shocked coaches and gymnasts. 
</P>
<P>
	``(The administration) never really gave us an answer why,''  
BYU's Guard Young said. ``We had no idea that we were being 
considered to be dropped.''

<HEADLINE> Auburn Sprinter Ready for Big Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN, Ala. (AP) -- When Auburn decided to enter Coby Miller in  
the Penn Relays, it was supposed to be just another track meet. 
</P>
<P>
	Then a pair of speedy performances earlier this month at the Sun  
Angel Classic in Tempe, Ariz., changed that. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, a relatively unknown sprinter in the world-class ranks,  
went into the Penn Relays today in Philadelphia with the 
second-fastest time in the world at the 100 meters this year. The 
plan was for him to run the 100 in only the college division at the 
Penn Relays, but his coach is now toying with the idea of letting 
him run in the open division. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a chance we may slip him in there,'' coach Ralph Spry  
said. ``See if he can turn some heads.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Miller does sneak into the field, it will be his first step  
towards gaining some recognition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know anything about him,'' said Tom Sturber, media  
information coordinator for USA Track &AMP; Field. ``But from the very 
fast times I've heard he's run, he could be a real breath of fresh 
air for the country this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller won the 100 at the Sun Angel Classic in 10.03 seconds,  
breaking Olympian Harvey Glance's 22-year-old school record of 
10.04. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, a junior who transferred to Auburn from Meridian (Miss.)  
Community College last season, has run in obscurity despite winning 
the NCAA indoor national title at 200 meters in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Spry has limited Miller to college meets and kept him out of the  
high-profile events against world-class competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coby's just a junior, he doesn't need to be exposed to too  
much to early,'' Spry said. ``I'd rather him make the mental 
adjustments necessary to dominate the college level before he goes 
after the next level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His 10.03 ranks second in the world this year behind Frank  
Fredericks' 9.94. Miller also won the 200 in 20.21 seconds, the 
fourth-fastest time in the world this year. In winning the 200, 
Miller beat a field that included Dennis Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
	At this stage, Miller doesn't really care in which events he  
competes. He's just glad to be running again. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Penn Relays is a really big deal, with a lot of great  
athletes there,'' Miller said. ``But my only goal is to always 
compete to the fullest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For a time, Miller couldn't run track at all. His grades weren't  
good enough for any major schools, so he accepted a football 
scholarship from East Central Community College in Decatur, Miss. 
The school didn't have a track team, so Miller concentrated on 
football and baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	But the football team was terrible and Miller missed track.  
</P>
<P>
	``Track was my first love and it took me not being able to run  
it to realize I needed to straighten up,'' Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	He left East Central after one year and headed to Meridian  
Community College, which did have a track team. There, Miller 
excelled on the track and in the classroom. He won the indoor 
National Junior College Championship in the 55 meters, and took 19 
credit hours a semester so he could move on to a bigger school. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't until that second year of junior college that Coby  
drew attention,'' Spry said. ``Then everyone on this level knew who 
he was and tried to get him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spry was one of them. He had just been hired at Auburn, taking  
over the program after Glance's move to Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	Spry knew that signing Miller would help ease the transition.  
Miller was about 7 pounds off his ideal weight of 190 when he got 
to Auburn. Spry, a former Army officer, whipped him into shape. 
</P>
<P>
	The two are now taking it one meet at a time at Auburn, with an  
emphasis on the NCAA Championships in June. But Spry knows he can't 
hold back Miller forever, so they've targeted the U.S. Track &AMP; 
Field Championships that month as his coming-out party. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't really matter to me what meets I run in,'' Miller  
said. ``I'm just happy to be running and getting my education at 
the same time.''

<HEADLINE> Star Watch: Reese Witherspoon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Reese Witherspoon is having what she calls a  
``pregnant lady day.'' It's the kind of day when she's likely to 
cry over anything. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like television commercials make me cry, for like 30 minutes  
or an hour,'' she says, as a makeup artist and hair stylist put the 
finishing touches on the young actress so she can do an interview 
and a photo session. 
</P>
<P>
	The kewpie-doll cute 23-year-old is pregnant with her first  
child, and is experiencing the full range of emotions that often 
accompany pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	She can slip into a down-home ``y'all'' or the girlish verbal  
tick of ``like'' at times, but she mostly talks in the 
straightforward manner of an erudite young woman -- a debutante, the 
daughter of a doctor and professor of nursing in Nashville, Tenn., 
the product of an exclusive all-girls school, a Stanford University 
English lit major. 
</P>
<P>
	On this morning, she's talking about her latest film,  
``Election,'' and suggesting that it doesn't neatly fit into the 
usual silly teen flicks that flood the market. 
</P>
<P>
	And she's right. The main character is a teacher, played by  
Matthew Broderick, going through a midlife crisis -- which mainly 
manifests in his intense dislike for one student (played by 
Witherspoon), an overachieving blonde running for class president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody has somebody in their life that they  
absolutely can't stand. And all your friends like them, and you're 
just like, `I don't know why but that person just rubs me the 
complete wrong way,''' says Witherspoon, citing her own school 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a particular girl in junior high that I didn't like. She  
just drove me nuts. She was always pretty and had lots of dates, 
and was always putting other people down, surreptitiously, and 
really just rubbed me the wrong way. 
</P>
<P>
	``And now she's like wildly successful. ... It's depressing. And  
here I go, playing pretend for a living.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not that it's a bad living, she concedes.  
</P>
<P>
	Since early last year, she's had a run of notable movies:  
``Twilight,'' in which she co-starred with Paul Newman, Gene 
Hackman and Susan Sarandon; ``Pleasantville,'' where she played a 
slut turned bookworm; and ``Cruel Intentions,'' an updated 
``Dangerous Liaisons,'' with her real-life fiance and father of her 
child, Ryan Phillippe, playing her seducer. She recently finished 
filming ``American Psycho,'' and still in the can is ``Best Laid 
Plans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her performances have garnered lots of notice in recent months,  
with magazines putting her on their covers or naming her to their 
``It List'' or ``Hot Squad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Witherspoon takes all of the up-and-coming-ingenue hype in  
stride. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's important to have the right perspective about  
it,'' she says. ``I have an entirely new perception of magazines -- 
which is that people pick it up, flip through a couple of pages, 
throw it on the floor and never look at it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So while it's flattering, you can't rest on the laurels of  
magazine buzz, she says. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just have to do the work to match the publicity.''  
</P>
<P>
	Despite the next-big-thing breathlessness of some publications,  
Witherspoon aims to be in this business for the long haul; she 
already has displayed staying power. 
</P>
<P>
	She started 16 years ago, at age 7, appearing in local TV  
commercials for a flower shop owned by neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just had a great time,'' she recalls. ``I was just so  
star-struck. And I told my mother that that's what I wanted to 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her parents sent her to acting classes, and she did other local  
commercials before landing her feature film debut in 1991's ``The 
Man in the Moon'' (not to be confused, she jokes, with the R.E.M. 
song and upcoming biopic about Andy Kaufman). That year, she also 
made her TV debut, in a Diane Keaton-directed Lifetime movie, 
``Wildflower.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She subsequently starred in ``Fear,'' co-starring Mark Wahlberg  
as a psycho-boyfriend, and ``Freeway,'' co-starring Kiefer 
Sutherland as yet another guy who terrorizes her. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of all of her movie work in the last couple of years,  
Witherspoon suspended her Stanford education, and she'll be taking 
the rest of the year off to get married and have the baby. 
</P>
<P>
	While she eventually would like to try her hand at  
screenwriting, she's no longer ambivalent about being an actress or 
wistfully thinking about following her parents' footsteps. 
</P>
<P>
	She can still think about med school, she says, ``but I think I  
kind of realized about two years ago that this was pretty 
fulfilling for me and that I enjoy what I do.''

<HEADLINE> Bristol-Myers Squibb Tops Estimate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP)-- Bristol-Myers Squibb on Wednesday posted a  
stronger-than-expected 15 percent rise in first quarter profits, 
citing robust sales for its cancer and diabetes drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol, the world's fourth largest drugmaker, earned $1.1  
billion or 53 cents per share in the first quarter, up from $927 
million or 46 cents a share in the same period a year ago. Results 
beat analysts' estimates by 1 cent a share, according to First Call 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose 9 percent to $4.9 billion from $4.4 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street welcomed the report by bidding the company's stock  
higher. It was up $3.50 at $62.75 a share on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Global pharmaceutical sales rose 15 percent to $3.4 billion in  
the quarter, including 21 percent sales growth in the United 
States. International sales rose just 5 percent as a result of the 
economic downturn in Brazil and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Pravachol, Bristol's top-selling drug, had a 9 percent increase  
in sales to $486 million. Pravachol is the world's third 
largest-selling cholesterol-lowering medication, and has about 16 
percent of the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Taxol, a breast and lung cancer drug, posted a 31 percent jump  
in sales to $329 million. Glucophage, the leading oral drug for 
non-insulin dependent diabetes, had a 55 percent increase in sales 
to $282 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol's beauty care sales rose by 7 percent to $572 million,  
benefiting from the introduction of Herbal Essences shampoo 
overseas last year. Sales of Herbal Essences, the second-biggest 
selling shampoo in the U.S. market, rose 28 percent to $164 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol's nutritional sales growth remained flat at about $449  
million. Nutritional sales include Enfamil infant formula and the 
nutritional supplement drink Boost. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it plans to seek U.S. approval later this year  
for its new hypertension drug. Bristol has two drugs, an antibiotic 
and a colorectal cancer medication, awaiting U.S. approval.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Profits Jump 43 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Strong performances across all of Microsoft  
Corp.'s product lines helped boost its quarterly profits by 43 
percent, the world's dominant maker of personal computer software 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite turmoil in the industry, the outlook for personal  
computers appears healthy, Greg Maffei, Microsoft's chief financial 
officer, said Tuesday after the financial figures were announced. 
He said Microsoft expects to continue to do well during the current 
quarter, as it brings out a new version of its industry-standard 
Office suite of business software. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said it earned $1.92 billion, or 35 cents a share, in  
its fiscal third quarter, which ended March 31. That was up from a 
profit of $1.34 billion, or 25 cents a share, in the year-ago 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose to $4.33 billion from $3.77 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	The profit beat the predictions of analysts surveyed by First  
Call Corp., who had expected 32 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft shares, which rose $2.12 1/2 a share Tuesday in  
anticipation of a strong report after the close of trading, was 
giving ground today. It dropped 2.5 percent, or by $2.06 1/4, to 
$81.06 1/4 a share at midmorning on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Not included in the third-quarter results is $400 million in  
revenue from early sales of Microsoft's new Office 2000 package of 
business software. Microsoft said it would defer that revenue into 
the current quarter. The product starts retail sales on June 10. 
</P>
<P>
	``Financially and operationally it was a very nice quarter, if  
somewhat complicated from an accounting standpoint,'' Maffei said 
on a conference call with reporters and analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd say it's more of the same in terms of where the growth is  
coming from,'' said Scott McAdams, president of brokerage McAdams 
Wright Ragen in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, which has no debt and pays no stock dividend, also  
reported a whopping $21.76 billion in cash and short-term 
investments, an increase of 56 percent from the $13.93 billion it 
had on hand last June 30. Long-term investments grew from $4.7 
billion to $7.47 billion in the past nine months. 
</P>
<P>
	The company doesn't have any new plans for its cash stockpile,  
said Carla Lewis, director of investor relations. Microsoft 
typically taps its reserves for research and development, business 
deals and to fund employee stock options. 
</P>
<P>
	Maffei partly tied the company's latest profit to strong demand  
for its server software, and said sales in Asia were rebounding. 
Licenses for SQL Server, its database software for large 
corporations, rose 50 percent from the year-ago quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Software sales to computer manufacturers were up 29 percent from  
last year, and sales of operating system software accounted for a 
bit more than $2 billion of the revenue for the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	While some manufacturers have suffered because of stronger  
demand for lower-cost computers, the higher number of machines sold 
benefited Microsoft, Maffei said. 
</P>
<P>
	``While there were jitters during the quarter and after, the PC  
market seems to be fundamentally healthy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said, however, that some customers were deferring  
purchases of new software in order to get ready for the so-called 
Y2K bug, in which computers incorrectly interpret the year 2000 as 
the year 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's Windows operating system runs the basic functions of  
90 percent of the world's personal computers. The company is 
fighting federal charges that it illegally wields its Windows 
monopoly to stifle competition in the technology industry. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of fiscal 1999, Microsoft reported  
profits of $5.58 billion or $1.02 a share, compared with net income 
of $3.13 billion or 59 cents a share a year earlier. Revenues grew 
to $13.22 billion from $10.49 billion.

<HEADLINE> Students, Parents Cope With Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- A day after seeing gunmen open fire in  
the high school cafeteria where she was eating, Andrea Launer was 
having trouble eating and screamed in her sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	The sophomore was trapped inside the Columbine High School  
cafeteria for about an hour before she was able to flee to safety. 
Later, she learned that two friends were hospitalized with serious 
gunshot wounds and that acquaintances were among the 15 who died in 
Tuesday's massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	``You feel you can't force yourself to eat,'' she said. ``My mom  
told me I was screaming in my sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just need to see everyone,'' she said, breaking into tears.  
She turned to hug a friend before walking into a prayer service at 
the Light of the World Roman Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,500 people -- grief counselors, clergy, parents, students  
and Littleton residents -- filled the church for an informational 
meeting and prayer service, hoping for answers and seeking solace. 
</P>
<P>
	Counselors and volunteers met the parents and students as they  
arrived, offering them information about stress and trauma. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what we call a crisis response,'' said one of the  
counselors, Robin Finegan, who assisted victims after the 1995 
Oklahoma City bombing. ``Healing is when we begin to integrate the 
response into your life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 12-foot-long, weather-worn wooden cross that had been used  
during a recent Easter service leaned on its side against a tree 
outside the door, adorned with flowers and cards brought by 
grief-stricken students. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephanie Roybal cried as she left the church with her son  
Justin, a sophomore who escaped without injury, and her younger 
son, Daniel, a middle school student. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the best relief is the people, the hugs, the caring,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the day, hundreds gathered in downtown Denver to mourn  
the victims. Clouds gathered over the city as those in the crowd 
cupped small candles against a cold breeze. 
</P>
<P>
	After a moment of silence, Mayor Wellington Webb asked the  
mourners to do three things when they returned home. 
</P>
<P>
	``First, say a prayer for those families from Columbine High  
School and hug your children,'' Webb said. ``Second, hug someone 
else's children, because in some cases, some kids aren't receiving 
the love they need. 
</P>
<P>
	``And lastly, hug someone that doesn't look like you.''  
</P>
<P>
	Columbine students who came downtown were joined by students  
from other Denver-area high schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I had to come down here,'' said Jamie Morgan, 14,  
a Columbine freshman. ``You never get over something like this, but 
we all will have to. I've had a hard time holding back tears here 
and today. I finally did give in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the home of Beth and Larry Nimmo, whose daughter, Rachel  
Scott, is believed to have died, the Rev. Bruce Porter was offering 
help. 
</P>
<P>
	``I spent a year and a half in Vietnam and I didn't have to deal  
with anything like what these kids are going through,'' Porter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Near Columbine, teacher Michelle DiManna was left numb. ``It's  
mind-boggling,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Student Lindsey Neam, 17, said: ``I don't know if I ever want to  
walk through the hallways again where people were lying dead. My 
brother will be a freshman next year, and he says he never wants to 
go to this school.''

<HEADLINE>  US Apache Helicopters Reach Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TIRANA, Albania (AP) -- Six low-flying but potent U.S. Apache  
helicopter gunships arrived in Albania on Wednesday, increasing the 
firepower available to NATO commanders in the Yugoslav conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Deployment of the Apaches, however, heightens the risk of  
American casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of what makes the black helicopter gunships so feared is  
their ability to fly just a few feet off the ground, swooping over 
Kosovo's hilly terrain and into valleys. But that also makes them 
easier targets for Serb anti-aircraft guns. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Army Capt. Mark Arden, in Albania preparing for the full  
unit's arrival from Italy, said: ``We're taking all precautions 
possible to minimize those risks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, he added, ``the risks to the Serbs, I would say, are  
great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least 24 of the anti-tank helicopters are expected to be  
deployed eventually. They will intensify NATO's campaign against 
the Yugoslav army and special police units accused of driving 
hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians out of neighboring Kosovo 
province in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Arden said many of the Apache pilots are Persian Gulf War  
veterans, and he described their unit as ``the tip of the spear of 
the entire U.S. military.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO decided to send in the helicopters early in its four-week  
air campaign against Yugoslavia. But logistical problems, and more 
recently bad weather in Albania, delayed their deployment. 
</P>
<P>
	There also were complications in assembling ground troops and  
support units for the Apaches, including a battalion of 
multiple-launch rocket systems to provide protection against Serb 
air defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes about 14 people on the ground to get one of the  
Apaches in the air,'' said Lt. Col. Vance Sales, commander of the 
229th Attack Helicopter Regiment at Fort Bragg, N.C. ``It is much 
more involved than a couple of pilots hopping in and taking off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO says the Apaches could be sent into Kosovo by next week.  
</P>
<P>
	Apaches are large and regarded as one of the most effective  
anti-tank weapons. Flown with a crew of two, they are armed with as 
many as 16 Hellfire missiles designed to knock out tanks and other 
armor. In addition, they have 70 mm rockets and a 30 mm cannon that 
can fire 625 rounds per minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Their introduction creates a new element in the conflict because  
the Apaches are slower and bigger targets than the high-flying, 
faster aircraft that NATO has used since its airstrikes began March 
24. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has lost one plane during the air campaign: an F-117A  
stealth fighter that crashed March 27. The pilot was rescued. Three 
U.S. soldiers also were captured near the Macedonian-Yugoslav 
border and remain in Serb custody.

<HEADLINE>  Everglades Blaze Being Contained </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IN THE FLORIDA EVERGLADES (AP) -- Levees, canals and a four-lane  
highway helped firefighters block flames from advancing farther 
through a sea of dry sawgrass. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're winding down on this one, we hope,'' said John Fish, a  
spokesman for the state Division of Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
	By Tuesday night the fire had consumed 160,000 acres. If  
firefighters keep it contained, the blaze should burn out after 
blackening an additional 10,000 acres, Fish said. 
</P>
<P>
	Early today, heavy smoke and low visibility prompted authorities  
to again close Interstate 75, the main east-west highway through 
the Everglades known as Alligator Alley. 
</P>
<P>
	John Cataldo, a spokesman for the Florida Highway Patrol, said  
the highway was closed as a temporary precaution. He added that the 
fire was still contained. 
</P>
<P>
	The flames, burning in a section of the Everglades' roughly 2  
million acres that is outside Everglades National Park, sent up 
columns of smoke visible from miles away Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Flames licked just past the edge of the mostly undeveloped  
Miccosukee Indian Reservation, located in the Everglades about 60 
miles west of Fort Lauderdale. A crew of about 20 Navajo 
firefighters from Window Rock, Ariz., helped quell flare-ups along 
the fire's western edge. 
</P>
<P>
	A new blaze just east of the fire's containment area burned  
seven acres before it was brought under control, and forestry 
officials blamed arson after a dark green Ford Explorer was spotted 
in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	The primary fire began in the eastern Everglades late last week  
and may have been ignited by heat from a vehicle's catalytic 
converter. The cause was still being investigated, Fish said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aided by swirling winds, the blaze quickly became the largest of  
at least 2,542 fires that have burned more than 230,000 acres in 
Florida this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in the state, two fires were burning in the  
Apalachicola National Forest in Wakulla County, said Liz Compton, a 
spokeswoman for the state Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither was threatening any homes or property, although one of  
the blazes advanced to within 20 miles of Tallahassee, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	With rainfall far below normal during Florida's  
December-through-April dry season, officials fear a repeat of last 
summer, when fires scorched nearly 500,000 acres and forced 100,000 
people from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Everglades, wildfires are part of a natural cycle that  
regularly burns away accumulated dry brush. Charred debris left 
behind by the flames will serve as a fertilizer, spurring new plant 
growth, said Tom Fontaine, an ecologist with the South Florida 
Water Management District. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ecosystem's going to be fine,'' he said. ``It will come  
back very much like it was before.''

<HEADLINE> Teen Gunman Described As a Follower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Columbine High School gunman Dylan  
Klebold was a follower, not a leader, who went astray after he met 
Eric Harris, friends say. 
</P>
<P>
	In Cub Scouts, he was a bright, dedicated boy who worked hard  
for his badges. He also got along well with his older brother. 
</P>
<P>
	But four years ago, he met Harris, who died along with him in  
the school library Tuesday after launching a gun-and-bomb attack on 
fellow students. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dylan was real quiet, real smart,'' said Nick Baumgart, 17, a  
senior who met Klebold in grade school. ``When Eric and Dylan got 
together, Eric changed Dylan's demeanor. Dylan was a follower, who 
was constantly looking for someone to lead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two got their own home computers, and linked them with  
modems. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had death matches with violent computer games, matching  
computer to computer,'' Baumgart said. ``I don't believe violent 
video games lead to violence, but this was different. They'd play 
these games for hours and hours and hours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baumgart said that Klebold, 17, was respectful to his teachers  
and did well in school, and that too much has been made of the fact 
that he joined Harris in a group called the ``Trenchcoat Mafia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``These were just a few kids who felt a little outcast,'' he  
said. ``It was just a way for them to get together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baumgart said the two killers weren't menacing to other  
students, ``but you didn't want them mad at you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I sure didn't think they'd kill people,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Klebold drove a beat-up BMW with a sticker for the hard-rock  
band Nine-Inch Nails. He liked sports, and was a big fan of the 
Boston Red Sox, said Andrew Beard, a fellow student. But he hated 
``jocks'' in school who teased him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dylan said he hated the jocks, and how they could walk over  
people and thought they were tough,'' Beard said. 
</P>
<P>
	John House, 17, a senior, said he refused to associate with  
Klebold after he joined the Trenchcoat Mafia.

	``I went bowling with him, and when he would do something good,  
he would shout, `Heil Hitler!' and throw up his hand,'' House said. 
``It just made everyone mad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Klebold family issued a statement late Wednesday through a  
Denver law firm. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot begin to convey our overwhelming sense of sorrow for  
everyone affected by this tragedy,'' it said. ``Our thoughts, 
prayers and heartfelt apologies go out to the victims, their 
families, friends, and the entire community. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like the rest of the country, we are struggling to understand  
why this happened, and ask that you please respect our privacy 
during this painful grieving period.''

<HEADLINE> Kimberly-Clark Earnings Up 47 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Kimberly-Clark Corp. reported its first-quarter  
earnings surged a stronger-than-expected 47 percent as sales rose 
in Europe and North America. 
</P>
<P>
	The paper products company said Wednesday it earned $403.7  
million, or 75 cents per share, up from $286.4 million, or 51 cents 
per share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Results for both years included restructuring charges of 3 cents  
per share. In 1998, there was also a 2 cent charge per share for an 
accounting change. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimberly-Clark's results easily surpassed analyst expectations  
of 65 cents a share, according to First Call Corp. The report sent 
Kimberly-Clark stock rising almost 8 percent, or by $4.12 1/2, to 
close at $58.43 3/4 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the quarter rose to $3.13 billion from $3.05 billion a  
year earlier. A portion of the increase was attributable to 
operations in Colombia, where Kimberly-Clark made an additional 
investment in late 1998 to gain majority ownership of its 
affiliated companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Personal products care products, such as tissues and diapers,  
rose 9 percent during the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	In the company's statement, chairman and chief executive Wayne  
Sanders said the company is generating growth while continuing to 
aggressively reduce costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimberly-Clark brands include Huggies, Kleenex, Kotex and  
Depend.

<HEADLINE> Pizza Magnate Turning to God's Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Domino's Pizza founder Thomas S. Monaghan spent  
nearly four decades making a lot of dough. Then he gave it up to 
work for someone else: God. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, after several years of Roman Catholic philanthropy and  
support of conservative causes, he is spending $50 million to 
establish a law school that he says will combine legal advocacy and 
Catholic morality. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the most exciting things I've been involved in  
in my life,'' said Monaghan, 61. ``Certainly, one of the most 
important. Certainly, a lot more important than selling pizzas, 
except, of course, that pizza made something like this possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monaghan's planned Ave Maria School of Law has already attracted  
some legal stars. 
</P>
<P>
	One-time Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork signed on as its  
first faculty member. Rep. Henry Hyde is a member of the board of 
governors, as is Cardinal John O'Connor, archbishop of New York. 
Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has offered advice. 
</P>
<P>
	The school plans to open in 2000 with about 40 students and  
seven or eight teachers. It will rent space in or around Ann Arbor, 
where Monaghan lives and Domino's is based. 
</P>
<P>
	The law school is part of Monaghan's larger effort to promote  
Catholic education. His foundation runs two elementary schools and 
two preschools, with another elementary school under construction. 
He is also building the Ave Maria College, a private liberal arts 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been very disappointed in general with Catholic education  
in the United States, particularly how it teaches the faith,'' said 
Monaghan, who went to 10 high schools and five colleges and never 
made it past his freshman year. ``I'm afraid that much of it has 
become secularized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also cites other reasons for promoting religious education:  
``The lack of God in our society, the breakup of families, the low 
legitimacy rate, abortion -- the list goes on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are already 24 Catholic law schools among the 181 law  
schools in the country -- and no shortage of lawyers, according to 
Ave Maria dean Bernard Dobranski. Even so, Dobranski said there is 
a need for high-quality lawyers with high morals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rule of law, we believe, must be grounded in the belief  
that there is an objective moral order, and that will be our 
mission,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some critics, such as the Rev. Robert Drinan, a law professor at  
Georgetown University, say existing Catholic law schools do a good 
job of mixing the legal with the spiritual. He said Georgetown was 
doing it ``before Mr. Monaghan was born.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have three full-time Jesuit lawyers. We say Mass at noon.  
What more can we do to make it Catholic?'' Drinan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Drinan said Monaghan's real aims appear to be political.  
</P>
<P>
	``The first professor hired is Robert Bork, and he's not known  
for any religious faith. They want his political views,'' he said, 
describing those views as ``right-wing, anti-abortion -- the views 
of Mr. Monaghan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Sedler, a law professor at Wayne State University known  
for promoting liberal causes, said he would have no problem with 
Ave Maria having a political agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's wrong with that? Lawyers like myself advocate civil  
rights, antiwar, equality. Lawyers do this -- they practice to 
advocate their causes,'' he said. ``I have the greatest respect for 
Mr. Monaghan. He made his fortune and he's using his fortune to 
advance causes he believes in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monaghan's fortune did not come easy. An orphan at 4, he spent  
his childhood in foster homes and orphanages, served three years in 
the Marines and then enrolled at the University of Michigan, hoping 
to pursue a degree in architecture. 
</P>
<P>
	To help pay for school, he and his brother, James, borrowed $900  
and bought a restaurant named DomiNick's. James Monaghan later 
traded his share of the business to his brother for a used 
Volkswagen Beetle. Thomas Monaghan added stores and renamed the 
company Domino's in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	As Domino's Pizza grew, so did Monaghan's flair for spending his  
profits. He bought the Detroit Tigers in 1983, set a record for 
used cars by paying $8 million for a 1931 Bugatti and spent $1.6 
million on a dining room table and chairs designed by Frank Lloyd 
Wright. 
</P>
<P>
	But starting in 1989, Monaghan took two years off from Domino's  
to explore his religious goals. He became an outspoken opponent of 
abortion, which resulted in a nationwide boycott of Domino's by the 
National Organization for Women. Finally, last year, he sold nearly 
all of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	``God's been very good to me,'' Monaghan said. ``This is  
something I wanted to do for some time -- to get out of the pizza 
business and get on with things that are more important. I call 
this the main event.''

<HEADLINE> New Coach Reid Shakes Up Eagles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Coach Andy Reid, wasting no time in shaking  
up the Philadelphia Eagles, on Wednesday released starting right 
offensive tackle Richard Cooper one day after waiving running back 
Charlie Garner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted to move in a different direction,'' Reid said  
Wednesday as the Eagles concluded a passing game and prepared for 
their annual post-draft minicamp. ``That's what I'm doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By releasing Cooper and Garner, the Eagles will save about $3.25  
million this year, some of which could go toward paying top draft 
pick Donovan McNabb's likely signing bonus of about $12 million. 
The moves will also give some younger players a chance for more 
playing time. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper started 15 games last year after missing all of 1997 with  
a triceps injury. He was originally signed by the Eagles as an 
unrestricted free agent in 1996 but had been criticized for not 
living up to a four-year, $10 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper's release means the Eagles will slide Jermane Mayberry  
from guard to tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	Garner gained only 381 rushing yards last year after re-signing  
with the Eagles as a free agent. He was expected to replace Ricky 
Watters, who signed with Seattle as a free agent in the 1998 
offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Garner hurt his ankle in exhibition play and was replaced by  
Duce Staley. Staley ran for 1,065 yards and Garner ended the season 
on injured reserve with injured ribs.

<HEADLINE> NATO Celebration To Be Sober Affair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NATO's 50th anniversary gala now is a  
reception. A ceremonial flyover has been grounded. Musicians are 
choosing dignified songs over zippy tunes. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is halfway around the  
globe, yet he is crashing the largest gathering of world leaders 
Washington ever has held. 
</P>
<P>
	Those planning social events for the NATO summit are quick to  
note that the meeting of 1,700 dignitaries from 44 NATO and partner 
countries has been toned down because of the allied bombing of 
Yugoslavia and the explusion of hundreds of thousands of refugees 
from Kosovo province. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I would call any of them a party, at this point.  
We're really not having a party. I think that we're all so 
concerned about what's happening,'' said the State Department's 
chief of protocol, Mary Mel French, who has been busy for the past 
seven months helping organize the historic event. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've stepped back and instead of it being a total celebration  
of NATO's 50th, as was originally planned, we're looking at it as 
bringing leaders together for a working meeting and dinners,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	They might not be called parties because of the conflict in  
Yugoslavia, but there still is going to be a lot of eating and 
drinking. There will be two White House dinners, receptions and 
luncheons for leaders and luncheons for their spouses. 
</P>
<P>
	Delegates to the three-day NATO conference will be served a  
sampling of food eaten by Washingtonians -- beef tenderloin and 
Caesar salad a la Capitol Hill, Oriental dishes from Chinatown, 
Mexican and Caribbean food from the trendy Adams Morgan district 
and peanut chicken and black-eyed pea salad, representing a 
predominately black section of Anacostia. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's just Saturday night at the $300,000 ``Washington  
Salutes NATO'' event where Mayor Anthony Williams is serving as 
host at the National Building Museum. Another reception is set for 
Friday night at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and 
Space Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	The press is having a party -- oops make that reception -- as  
well. More than 3,200 credentialed members of the media were 
invited tonight to the Ronald Reagan Building for an event with a 
``Walk Down Main Street U.S.A.'' theme. There will be hot dog, 
popcorn and pretzel carts and three military combo bands playing 
jazz and Dixieland music in the background. 
</P>
<P>
	At midday Friday, there will be a program to commemorate the  
April 4, 1949 signing of the North Atlantic Treaty. Initially, 
eight U.S. and German fighter planes plus a NATO command and 
control plane were to fly over the ceremony, but planners scrapped 
this preliminary idea, says Maj. Craig Greene, who is helping plan 
ceremonies on the NATO summit staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslavian conflict may have dimmed party spirits, but  
there will be no shortage of bright-colored flowers and flags. 
</P>
<P>
	Red, yellow, purple and pink tulips are in full bloom in  
Washington. City workers have been manicuring green lawns. A large 
white tent has been erected on the White House South Lawn. More 
than 40 flags of the NATO and partner countries will be displayed 
at events around the city. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eight sets of the 44 flags will used to cover the whole  
weekend -- press conferences, photo shots, meetings, luncheons, 
dinners,'' Greene says. 
</P>
<P>
	To add a festive flair, musicians will be hauling instruments in  
and out of events throughout the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``For some of the events, it will be more of a fanfare, sort of  
like trumpets and ta-dat, ta-dat, ta-dah,'' Greene says. ``For the 
luncheons and dinners, it will be background music from string 
quartets to harps and flutes to strolling strings.''

<HEADLINE> Penguins Know Upsets Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANONSBURG, Pa. (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Penguins don't need a very  
long memory to realize that a low-seeded team can oust a 
high-seeded team from the NHL playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Evidence in point: The 1998 playoffs, when the second-seeded  
Penguins were eliminated in six games by the No. 7 Montreal 
Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, as they prepare for their No. 8 against No. 1 matchup  
against the New Jersey Devils that begins Thursday, the Penguins 
are convinced they are capable of pulling off just such a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	Need more inspiration? How about coach Kevin Constantine, whose  
1994 San Jose Sharks were a huge underdog before stunning the 
Detroit Red Wings in a first-round Western Conference series? 
</P>
<P>
	Those Sharks didn't have NHL scoring champion Jaromir Jagr in  
their lineup, either. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the similarity -- it's No. 1 against No. 8,''  
Constantine said Tuesday. ``They (the Red Wings) were much better 
during the regular season (than the Sharks). We're closer to New 
Jersey than that team was to Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``But, remember, the regular season doesn't mean anything now.  
We know that No. 1 can beat No. 8, but we also know No. 8 can beat 
No. 1. There are 16 teams than can win the Stanley Cup, and they 
all have an equal opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, these numbers would seem to be most discouraging to the  
Penguins: 
</P>
<P>
	--They are 1-4 against the more physical Devils, including four  
consecutive losses. And the first two games of the series will be 
on the Devils' home ice on Thursday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	--They haven't advanced past the first round of the playoffs  
since 1996, losing to the Flyers in 1997 and the Canadiens last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	--Despite their season-ending 2-1 overtime victory Sunday over  
the New York Rangers that sent Wayne Gretzky into retirement with a 
loss, they have won only twice in their last 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Momentum, thy name is not Penguins.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're not given a chance to win,'' said goaltender Tom  
Barrasso, who, with Jagr is one of two Penguins remaining from the 
1991-92 Stanley Cup title teams. ``But I know a team that got beat 
by a New York Islanders team that no one gave a chance to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barrasso was referring to the 1993 Penguins, arguably the most  
talented team in franchise history. The Mario Lemieux-led Penguins 
were coming off a record 17-game winning streak and the NHL's 
regular-season championship, only to be eliminated by a pedestrian 
Islanders team in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why I don't think anyone in this room cares what  
anybody else thinks,'' Barrasso said. 
</P>
<P>
	The series will be the first for Jagr as the Penguins' captain.  
Favored to win the Hart Trophy as the NHL's most valuable player, 
Jagr was preceded by two captains experienced in winning Stanley 
Cups: Lemieux and Ron Francis. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr does not profess to be the team leader that Francis was or  
the player that Lemieux was, even if Gretzky says he is close. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jagr proved in 1992, when Lemieux's wrist was broken and the  
Penguins' hopes of repeating as Stanley Cup champions was in 
jeopardy, that he can carry a team to improbable heights. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr had three goals and five assists against New Jersey during  
the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	``They probably are the best team in the league right now,''  
Jagr said. ``But I have been in the league nine years now, and I 
can tell you that anything is possible, no matter who is playing. 
... And I think we'll be more ready than we were last year.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Plans To Forgive Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan plans to waive its loans to 41 impoverished  
countries as part of efforts among developed nations to alleviate 
the third world debt burden, a Finance Ministry official said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa intends to inform his  
Group of Seven counterparts of the plan when he meets them on 
Monday, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan, the world's largest provider of Official Development Aid  
loans, carries about $7.82 billion (930 billion yen) in debts owed 
by the world's poorest countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo has resisted calls to forgive the debt, on the grounds  
that Japan's burden was higher than that of other developed 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
	But Japanese officials have been working on a plan ahead of the  
June summit of G-7 nations in Germany, where leaders hope to agree 
upon a debt cancellation strategy for third world countries, the 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	German Chancellor Gerhard Shroeder, who will host the summit,  
wants industrialized countries to forgive all ODA loans to the 
world's 41 poorest countries by the end of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The nationally circulated Asahi newspaper said that Japan has  
decided to cancel the ODA loans on condition other industrialized 
nations accept some of the financial load of carrying out the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan would effectively wipe out the debt by expanding official  
relief grants to the 41 impoverished countries, the Asahi said. 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman declined to confirm details of the plan, saying  
they were still being worked out.

<HEADLINE> Gore To Announce Air-Quality Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore will use Earth Day on  
Thursday to announce new regulations to clean up the air over 
smoggy federal parks -- touting his environmental record as a 
strength as he pursues the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, some Republican presidential hopefuls are  
beginning to portray Gore as an extremist when it comes to 
protecting the Earth. GOP contender Dan Quayle promised in a 
scathing speech to press Gore on environmental issues in the 
upcoming campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	In a trip Thursday to the Blue Ridge Mountains, Gore will stress  
the environmental theme by announcing a new federal push to bring 
air quality over national parks -- some of which now choke in summer 
smog -- back to pristine, pre-industrial levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulations will call for states to adopt pollution controls  
that steadily improve air quality in each of the next six decades 
with a goal to eliminating manmade pollution by 2064 in such parks 
as the Grand Canyon, Great Smoky Mountains and Acadia in Maine. The 
Environmental Protection Agency would implement the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Even states that have no pollution-plagued parks will have to  
develop programs to achieve the long-term goal, including further 
reductions in emissions from coal-burning power plants, say sources 
briefed on the new requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, the government will force states to assess  
the sources of park air pollution and require some major sources to 
install more sophisticated control technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	Convinced that environmental protection resonates positively  
among voters, Gore chose to personally highlight the new park air 
rules, just as he recently did in announcing a program aimed at 
combating suburban sprawl. 
</P>
<P>
	While some Republicans presidential aspirants remain uncertain  
over how to respond to Gore on the environment, others are taking 
the offensive. 
</P>
<P>
	In a strong attack on Gore in remarks to be delivered Wednesday  
night to the conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute, Quayle 
called Gore's fervor on the environment an extremist attack on 
capitalism and reflective of a vision that is ``pessimistic to the 
core.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Gore argues that the rescue of the environment should be the  
new central organizing principle of civilization,'' Quayle 
declared, taking some words of his speech from Gore's book, ``Earth 
in the Balance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle accused Gore of promoting a global warming policy based  
on findings that are ``highly debatable'' with ``no scientific 
consensus.'' And he accused Gore -- concerning his recent initiative 
to protect open spaces -- of trying to dictate ``where you should 
live, and how to design your commute to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Smith, the institute's president, said Republicans know the  
``Democrats have the ball'' on the environment issue. After 
speaking to some GOP presidential aspirants, he said, ``All of them 
are nervous about the issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to comment on Quayle's attack, EPA Administrator Carol  
Browner asked: ``Does he talk about (Republicans) trying to roll 
back environmental laws in Congress?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Browner said in an interview that Gore has demonstrated that  
environmental protection and economic growth can go hand in hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public wants a president ... committed to strengthening  
the environment and public health protection,'' said Browner. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, the environmentalists' favorite, hasn't escaped their  
criticism, however. Last week, a group of environmental leaders 
complained that he hasn't done enough to improve fuel efficiency in 
cars and to develop cleaner electricity sources -- both key to 
dealing with climate change, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public will reward candidates who tackle pressing  
environmental problems,'' said Carl Pope, Sierra Club's executive 
director and one environmentalist who complained. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Republicans in Congress gave reporters a list of  
environmental accomplishments and objectives. ``We are here to 
dispel the myth that only one party is engaged in shaping 
environmental policy,'' said Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I.

<HEADLINE> Hootie Plans Include Third Album </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hootie and the Blowfish is bouncing back from  
backlash and sophomore slump with a third album, ``Musical 
Chairs,'' and a lot of touring. 
</P>
<P>
	Hootie's 1994 debut album, ``Cracked Rear View,'' sold 15  
million. But its second, ``Fairweather Johnson,'' released two 
years later, sold only 3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The backlash that Hootie endured after ``Cracked Rear View''  
came as no surprise. ``It is like everything in life,'' said 
guitarist Mark Bryan. ``With that much success, there is going to 
be a downside. You can't have 15 million sales without having some 
detractors as well. We weren't going to quit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some comments were hurtful.  
</P>
<P>
	``People are entitled to their opinions. There's certainly music  
I don't like. I don't expect everybody to like ours,'' Bryan said. 
``Some people said we'd sold out. That was upsetting. That hurt. We 
didn't do anything different to become successful or afterwards. We 
were always ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Only Lonely'' is the second single from ``Musical Chairs.''  
The song is also a single release from the movie soundtrack CD, 
``Message in a Bottle.'' Lead singer Darius Rucker wrote the lyrics 
based on the story for the film, ``You've Got Mail.'' But director 
Nora Ephron didn't want the song. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlantic Records pushed for the song in ``Message in a Bottle.''  
</P>
<P>
	The new CD also includes ``Desert Mountain Showdown,'' which  
Bryan wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's some of the most fun music I've ever written,'' he said.  
``You can tell I've been listening to bluegrass. Darius turned me 
on to Doc Watson. Music is my true love in life. I discover things 
like bluegrass. There's so much out there, different styles, new 
instruments to learn, songs I haven't written yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's got Darius playing mandolin. He had never played it. I  
said, 'The chords are not that hard, if you can play guitar. You 
learn where to put your fingers.' He was fine. He had a smile on 
his face when he played it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hootie toured for three weeks in New Zealand, Australia and  
Japan prior to its current U.S. tour. After the tour ends July 3, 
there will likely be a tour in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. tour includes some big festivals.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a blast,'' Bryan said.  
</P>
<P>
	Bryan and bassist Dean Felber grew up in Maryland. The band,  
which also includes drummer Jim ``Soni'' Sonefeld, got together at 
the University of South Carolina in 1985. The name is a compound of 
nicknames from two of Rucker's friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were a cover band the first three years, playing parties  
and clubs and having a good time. When we graduated, we decided to 
see what would happen,'' Bryan said. ``If we sold records, great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If anyone had predicted their first album would sell 200,000  
copies (never mind 15 million), ``We wouldn't have been able to 
believe it,'' Bryan said. ``'Wow, that's a lot of records,' we'd 
have said. The next thing you know, it sold one million, then two 
million, before you knew it, 15 million. It was quite a run. It was 
out in 1994 and really took off in 1995.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The band worked hard to make a name for itself.  
</P>
<P>
	``Before we put the record out, we toured constantly trying to  
create awareness about the band,'' he said. ``Then we kept touring 
two years, just steadily.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weary from touring, Hootie took a break. Band members decided to  
get back together when the urge arose. ``We wanted that feeling of 
itching to do this again,'' Bryan said. ``Once we had that, we went 
and did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That time came in October 1997. They traveled to Jackson Hole,  
Wyo., where they played golf during the day, came up with songs at 
night, and made fun of each other like old friends do. In December, 
they worked on 20 song ideas. After Christmas, they finished the 
songs for ``Musical Chairs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They decided to ``make sure we are happy doing what we do best:  
making music we want to make and enjoying it,'' Bryan said. ``It 
would be nice to sell 15 million again. But we're in a good 
position. We're going to be able to tour the world for a long time 
to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Hootie isn't getting much radio play.  
</P>
<P>
	``Radio played us too much three years ago. We hated how much we  
were overexposed. The ball gets rolling, you can't stop it,'' he 
said. ``Now they're not willing to play us. It's a problem, not 
letting the public get into your song and having it become a hit. 
We're still trying.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Move Higher; Dow Up 32.93 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved higher Wednesday as investors  
selectively bought technology issues that were beaten down earlier 
this week, and aggressively picked up small-company shares. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 32.93 at 10,481.48, but had given back some of its gains after 
rising 105 points earlier in the session. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Nasdaq composite,  
which is heavily weighted in tech stocks, was up 48.45 at 2,458.09. 
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 15.11 at 1,321.28. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders noted that the Russell 2000 average was up 8.66 at  
424.00 on strong interest in smaller company names. 
</P>
<P>
	The market continued its recovery from Monday's sharp selloff,  
which hit technology stocks particularly hard. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq was higher despite a 1-point drop in Microsoft shares  
to 81. The software maker said late Tuesday it earned 35 cents a 
share, beating Wall Street's estimates of 32 cents. But the company 
warned that Year 2000 computer bug concerns could slow growth later 
in the year, and Prudential Securities downgraded the stock's 
rating to ``hold'' from ``accumulate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The market was getting another look at the state of technology  
companies after the close of trading today, when IBM was expected 
to report its earnings. IBM, a Dow component, was off 2 3/8 at 167 3/8, 
as traders waited for the news. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong earnings reports spurred buying in some sectors.  
</P>
<P>
	Qualcomm shares soared 44 1/4 to 184 7/8 in Nasdaq trading, after the  
San Diego maker of digital-wireless technology company reported 
operating income of 82 cents a share, well above analysts' expected 
59 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders also responded positively to an earnings report from Dow  
component Coca-Cola, whose shares were up 2 5/16 at 67 5/8 on the Big 
Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug stocks, which had also come out of favor earlier this week,  
were back on the list of gainers. Merck shares were up 3/8 at 75 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the market can walk and chew gum at the same time,''  
said Barry Hyman, senior equity analyst at Ehrenkrantz King 
Nussbaum. ``You had a severe fear on Monday, and within two days, 
the market has recouped those losses. I think the market looks 
great, but it needs the rest, and it will get it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advancers led decliners by 3 to 2 on the New York Stock  
Exchange, where volume came to 613 million shares, down from 
Tuesday's pace.

	DON'T POUR YOUR MONEY INTO A NEW CAR: What's the difference  
between a $30,000 car and one that costs $50,000? A lot of wasted 
money, according to Stephan Sharf, a former Chrysler Corp. 
manufacturing executive. Writing in the trade magazine Ward's Auto 
World, Sharf says the equipment used to make cheaper cars costs the 
same as the machines that turn out expensive cars, and autoworkers 
are not paid according to how expensive their products are. All the 
amenities like heated steering wheels and leather seats just don't 
add up to that extra $20,000. Sharf suggests it would be better to 
buy a pair of gloves and forgo the heated steering wheels. If it's 
prestige you're looking for, he says, ``it would be cheaper and 
make more sense to buy $20 cigars.''

	WORKER LOYALTY: Although the U.S. job market is tight and many  
American workers could easily find new positions if they want them, 
employees are generally pretty loyal to their bosses, finds Aon, a 
Chicago-based consulting firm. Aon surveyed 1,800 workers and found 
that they tend to be most loyal to employers who help them balance 
job and family demands. ``Management's recognition of the 
importance of personal and family life remains the top driver of 
employee loyalty,'' Aon said in a news release. It noted that 
employees who were able to spend a moderate time of each week 
attending to personal matters while they were at work tended to 
have a higher level of commitment than those who had no time for 
personal matters while on the job.

	DELIVERING BAD NEWS: Almost everyone dreads having to give bad  
news to an employee -- or anyone, for that matter. But Dr. Robert 
Buckman, an oncologist in Toronto, says there are ways to make it 
easier for both sides. Buckman, interviewed in Fast Company 
magazine, says that starting a conversation by listening instead of 
talking -- in other words, by asking questions like ``How are you 
feeling?'' -- helps to build trust. If the conversation is a 
performance review, he suggests first asking employees how they 
feel they're doing. Being empathic, which means acknowledging an 
employee's feelings, is crucial. For example, if the employee 
starts to cry, it would be helpful to say, ``I'm making you cry. 
This must be awful for you.'' If the employee feels his or her 
emotions are being legitimized, the bad news will be a lot easier 
to take.

<HEADLINE> New Child Health Program Taking Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly 1 million children in working poor  
families were covered by health insurance last year for the first 
time under a new program, the largest Clinton administration health 
initiative to become law. 
</P>
<P>
	The $24 billion, five-year program to provide health insurance  
is expected to cover about 2.5 million of the nation's 11 million 
uninsured children by the time the program is fully implemented in 
October 2000, the Department of Health and Human Services said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	That's close to the 2.3 million children estimated by the  
Congressional Budget Office in 1997 when the bill was approved as 
part of a massive budget deal. 
</P>
<P>
	In talking about the program, President Clinton often implied  
that it would cover 5 million children. But to get to 5 million, 
the administration is hoping states will find some of the estimated 
4 million children already eligible for Medicaid as they sign 
families up for the new kids' health program. 
</P>
<P>
	To that end, the administration is working with the states and  
private groups to simplify the enrollment process for both 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	When the new program was created, the nation had 10 million  
uninsured children. Since then, the number has grown to 11 million, 
and many fear it will continue to grow as families leave welfare 
and don't realize that children often remain eligible for health 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's announcement was the first time the government gave  
actual enrollment numbers for the program. There was bipartisan 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	``Almost 1 million more children in America have insurance,''  
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton announced in a health care speech 
at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is wonderful news,'' said Sen. William Roth, R-Del.,  
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee that shepherded the 
legislation. ``This health insurance program we created has made a 
tangible difference in the lives of 982,011 children and their 
families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Mrs. Clinton noted that some states have made more progress  
than others in finding children who need insurance and qualify for 
the new program. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of creativity, but there's a long way to go,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The program provides health insurance to children whose families  
are not poor enough to qualify for the traditional Medicaid program 
but cannot afford to buy coverage on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, 43 states and U.S. territories were operating  
children's health programs. They had their choice to create new 
programs or to expand Medicaid. Last year, about 540,000 children 
were in state programs and 442,000 kids were in Medicaid 
expansions. 
</P>
<P>
	The slow start has meant that states spent just $500 million  
last year, less than one-eighth of the $4.3 billion allocated. And 
in 1999, the Congressional Budget Office projects that states will 
spend just $1 billion of the $4.3 billion available. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Peacock, an HHS spokesman, said the program's slow start  
should come as no surprise. The average program has been in 
operation for only about six months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the beginning of this very historic, very progressive  
program,'' he said. ``Some states are just beginning to implement 
their programs.''

<HEADLINE> Many Tell Shooting Story on TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- TV reporters didn't have to go far to find teen  
survivors of the Colorado school shooting willing to talk about 
their experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Some students who had been in Columbine High School were eager  
to discuss the attack and flocked to the cameras. Their interviews 
dominated Wednesday's near-constant cable news coverage of the 
massacre and turned television into a public grief counseling 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're the most compelling part of the story,'' said John  
Moody, Fox News Channel vice president of news. ``Every time I see 
a new person, I want to hear their stories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the potential to cross the line between information and  
exploitation, news executives said they were trying to be sensitive 
and not bother people who wanted to keep their trauma private. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the shooting even ended on Tuesday, one student used a  
cell phone to call Denver's KUSA-TV from the school to describe 
what was going on. The conversation was aired live by the station 
and picked up by CNN and MSNBC. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerned that the student could alert the gunmen to his  
whereabouts, MSNBC cut away from the conversation and KUSA-TV urged 
other students not to call. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, most interview subjects had come back to the  
school, and many approached reporters, said Erik Sorenson, MSNBC's 
vice president and general manager. One student got up after just a 
few hours of sleep and drove down to where reporters were camped 
out to share his story. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had some kids on last night who could have co-anchored our  
coverage, they were so media-savvy,'' Sorenson said. 
</P>
<P>
	One girl, Katie Crona, likened the sound of screams to ``people  
going downhill on a roller-coaster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine junior Steve Nason explained on MSNBC how he and some  
of his classmates crowded into an office to escape the gunmen, 
barricading the door with file cabinets and desks. 
</P>
<P>
	The day after, Nason spoke of the media attention.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a trip,'' he said. ``It's unbelievable. None of us had  
any idea how national this was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A psychologist said talking about the experience often helps  
people involved in tragedies avoid suffering from post-traumatic 
stress syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	``Though it's not the primary point of what the media is doing,  
it's probably helping these kids,'' said Cynthia Last, director of 
the Anxiety Treatment Center at Nova Southeastern University in 
Fort Lauderdale, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	She said, however, that reporters should stay away from students  
who didn't want to speak and should keep their questions general. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's fair to interview a person in his or her teens  
who appears to be stable,'' Fox's Moody said. ``I wouldn't go over 
there and grab someone who is choking on tears or appears to be 
catching their breath.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's breaking coverage gave a big boost to the news  
networks. Fox News Channel, for example, had its highest 24-hour 
rating since its launch in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Many networks scrambled their plans to react to the tragedy. An  
MTV documentary about warning signs of teen-age violence was moved 
up from next week to Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nickelodeon took time out from filming a kids-oriented special  
about Kosovo to update a ``Kids and Guns'' special. It was 
scheduled to air today.

<HEADLINE> Leaders OK Peace Deal in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Leaders of rival groups in East Timor  
signed a broadly worded peace deal Wednesday, appealing for an end 
to violence in the troubled Indonesian territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Doubts immediately rose about the effectiveness of the plan,  
however, because it did not address the key issue of disarming 
either the separatist rebels or militiamen who want East Timor to 
stay part of Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	It also failed to address the key isssue of East Timor's  
political future and did not involve a key rebel leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it a year  
later. Violence has escalated since Indonesia reversed policy 
earlier this year and said it would let go of the former Portuguese 
colony if its people reject an autonomy offer. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N.-sponsored talks between Indonesia and Portugal were  
scheduled Wednesday in New York to wrap up details of the autonomy 
proposal scheduled for a vote in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Violence has jeopardized the vote and pro-Indonesian militiamen  
have demanded that it be canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian President B.J. Habibie told a group of Australian  
newspaper editors Wednesday that he was committed to relinquishing 
control of East Timor if it chooses independence. But he 
acknowledged the difficulty of disarming the militias. 
</P>
<P>
	The peace pledge came only days after the militiamen rampaged  
through the territory's capital, Dili, attacking and burning the 
homes of pro-independence activists. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian security forces mostly stayed away from the fighting,  
which left as many as 20 people dead. The military has armed and 
trained some civilian militias, saying they act as neutral backup 
for the police force. 
</P>
<P>
	The initiative for the peace deal came from local police and  
military commanders, who are widely distrusted by separatist 
activists, and coincided with a visit by Gen. Wiranto, Indonesia's 
military chief. 
</P>
<P>
	Roman Catholic officials, who often play a mediating role in  
East Timor's long-running conflict, said they weren't informed of 
the details of the peace agreement until Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Participants in the ceremony included Leandro Isacc, a leader of  
the pro-independence umbrella group, the National Council for 
Timorese Resistance, and Joao Tavares, head of a pro-Indonesian 
militia. Col. Tono Suratman, head of the military in East Timor, 
also took part. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony was witnessed by Bishop Carlos Belo, co-winner of  
the 1996 Nobel peace prize, and Wiranto, who flew to East Timor to 
assess the security situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Alexandre Gusmao, the jailed leader of East Timor's rebels,  
did not take part. He recently urged his followers to step up 
attacks on the Indonesian military in retaliation for militia 
violence.

<HEADLINE> $3M Bias Award Against UAL Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A state appeals court upheld nearly $3  
million in damages for a Muslim man who said he was wrongly fired 
by United Airlines after enduring months of ridicule, including an 
order to clean a plane toilet with his hands. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1st District Court of Appeals ruled 3-0 that the evidence  
justified the jury's conclusion that Ahmad Abu-Aziz suffered severe 
harassment due to his religion and Jordanian national origin. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision, released Wednesday, upheld a March 1997 jury award  
of $2.67 million in punitive damages, along with money for lost 
wages and emotional distress. The airline had alleged in its appeal 
that there was no substantial evidence to support the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Aziz began cleaning planes for United in October 1994 while  
studying to be an airline mechanic. He testified he was subjected 
to a barrage of ethnic slurs during his four-month tenure that 
began on his first day when his boss poked fun at his name. 
</P>
<P>
	Among his complaints, Abu-Aziz said his immediate boss mocked  
Arab women and Arab culture, and ordered him to clean an airplane 
toilet with his hands. He also said a flight attendant once joked 
that he looked like a terrorist. 
</P>
<P>
	When he complained, Abu-Aziz said his supervisor told him he  
wasn't a ``team player'' and suggested that he keep a low profile. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Aziz testified he was fired in January 1995 after a coworker  
who had previously harassed him alleged Abu-Aziz took part in an 
unauthorized party held by a cleaning crew aboard a parked jet. 
</P>
<P>
	He testified airline officials also accused him of drinking on  
the job despite his offering to take a blood test to disprove the 
charge. The accusation followed closely his refusal to stash a 
liquor bottle in his locker for a coworker, he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Might Visit Colorado </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Half a continent away from the tragic scene,  
President Clinton and his Cabinet today mobilized what help they 
could offer grieving Littleton, Colo. -- and to ``hammer home to all 
the children of America that violence is wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``All of us are struggling to understand exactly what happened  
and why,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, who canceled a celebratory political trip to Texas  
today and moved up a Thursday meeting with British Prime Minister 
Tony Blair, weighed traveling to suburban Denver to comfort victims 
of the massacre inside Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	``For now, when the school has apparently just been killed with  
bombs and not all the children who were slain have been carried 
out, I think it is important on this day that we continue to offer 
the people of Colorado, the people of Littleton, the families 
involved the sure knowledge that all of America cares for them and 
is praying for them,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman Joe Lockhart said no decision has been made on travel.  
``There's obviously time on the schedule,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president wants to do what's best for the local community.  
... We are especially sensitive to not causing any disruption or 
distraction to the ongoing efforts there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grief counselors, at Clinton's command, stood ready to make the  
trip when called. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps the most important thing all of us can do right now is  
to reach out to each other and to families and their young 
children,'' Clinton said at the White House, addressing the tragedy 
for the second time. 
</P>
<P>
	He said children all over America need to be reassured of their  
safety. ``We also have to take this moment once again to hammer 
home to all the children of America that violence is wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``And parents should take this moment to ask what else they can  
do to shield our children from violent images and experiences that 
warp young perceptions and obscure the consequences of violence -- 
to show our children by the power of our own example how to resolve 
conflicts peacefully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from the departments of Education, Treasury, Justice  
and Health and Human Services and from the Federal Emergency 
Management Administration held a conference call this morning on 
what aid they could give Jefferson County, where Columbine High is 
located. 
</P>
<P>
	Education Secretary Richard Riley consulted the local school  
superintendent by phone. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the position of the federal government, we would  
acknowledge that there are limits to what we can do,'' Lockhart 
said. ``But there certainly should be no limits to what we try to 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke to the nation Tuesday night after he was assured  
the last of the gunshots had been fired inside Columbine. He was 
somberly mindful of the earlier tragedies at schools in 
Springfield, Ore.; West Paducah, Ky.; Edinboro, Pa.; Jonesboro, 
Ark.; and Pearl, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressed by reporters to say what the government might do to stop  
such school violence, Clinton said the Colorado community was ``an 
open wound'' needing time to grieve. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been scheduled to celebrate the new Austin-Bergstrom  
International Airport in Texas today and to star at political 
fund-raisers in Austin and Houston. The president felt it was 
``better and more appropriate'' to remain in Washington, Lockhart 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Six months ago, Clinton -- with Vice President Al Gore, first  
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and about 800 educators and 
law-enforcement officials -- held a White House conference on school 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday night, after hours of nonstop television coverage of the  
dramatic events in suburban Denver, Clinton acknowledged the nation 
has made little progress. And he was asked whether he still 
believed his administration's contention last October that students 
are still safer sitting in a classroom than they are walking down 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
	``Statistically, for all the whole 53 million kids in our  
schools, it's true,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	But at Columbine High, where the attackers were apparently armed  
with hand grenades, explosives and high-powered weapons, ``it 
obviously wasn't true there. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was obviously the most dangerous place in Colorado  
today.''

<HEADLINE> Tribes Seek Tougher Grave Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thousands of Indian remains and sacred  
artifacts haven't been returned to tribes because of delays by 
museums and loopholes in a federal grave-protection law, a Senate 
committee was told Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 14,000 human remains out of 200,000 identified nationally  
have been returned to tribes under the 1990 law, the committee 
said, and many of the remains that haven't been returned can't be 
identified by tribe. 
</P>
<P>
	But tribal leaders told the Senate Indian Affairs Committee the  
Native American Grave Protection and Repatriation Act is too 
narrowly written, and the National Park Service has too little 
money and staff to enforce it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not rest until we have brought each of our relatives  
home and buried them,'' said Tex Hall, chairman of North Dakota's 
Three Affiliated Tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	The law covered remains and artifacts held by federal agencies  
and federally funded institutions or excavated from federal land. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall worries that the law won't protect remains or artifacts at  
hundreds of sites where his tribal ancestors lived along the 
Missouri River in South Dakota. The sites are on land the federal 
government is turning over to South Dakota's state government under 
a law enacted last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In another case, a Maryland college sold at auction a  
hair-fringed buckskin shirt that purportedly belonged to the Sioux 
leader Crazy Horse. Washington College of Chestertown, Md., claimed 
it wasn't covered by the law. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer representing Crazy Horse's descendants told the  
committee the college sold the shirt without responding to his 
requests to determine whether it was authentic or if it was 
protected by the law. The auction house did not identify the buyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The shirt for all intents and purposes is gone, and we don't  
know where,'' said attorney Robert Gough, a member of South 
Dakota's Rosebud Sioux Tribe. 
</P>
<P>
	The descendants filed a federal lawsuit against the college  
earlier this month and also have asked the National Park Service to 
penalize the private school. 
</P>
<P>
	College officials issued a statement Tuesday that maintained  
they ``acted in full compliance'' with the law and are cooperating 
with federal officials investigating Gough's allegations. The shirt 
was cleared for auction by the U.S. attorney's office in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for organizations of museums and archaeologists told  
the committee the law is working as intended, but they agreed with 
the tribal leaders that it should be broadened beyond federal 
lands. 
</P>
<P>
	``Repatriations of human remains and cultural items, from both  
museum collections and new excavations, occur regularly,'' said 
Keith Kintigh, president of the Society for American Archaeology. 
``Most of these repatriations result from mutual agreements between 
tribes and museums and agencies.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Orders Texas Girl Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- A judge today ordered the release of a  
14-year-old girl whose conviction in the beating death of a 
2-year-old was reversed by an appeals court last week. 
</P>
<P>
	State District Judge John Dietz ruled after a morning hearing  
that Lacresha Murray be released into the custody of her 
grandparents under strict supervision. Her attorney said she could 
be released as early as today. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacresha originally was charged with capital murder at age 11,  
making her the youngest person in Texas to face such a charge. 
After two trials, she was eventually convicted of injury to a child 
and sentenced to 25 years for the beating death of toddler Jayla 
Belton. 
</P>
<P>
	Jayla died May 24, 1996, of massive internal injuries, including  
a severed liver, after spending the day in the home Lacresha shared 
with her grandparents and five brothers and sisters. The family 
often baby-sat for Jayla and other children. 
</P>
<P>
	Dietz's ruling came despite a plea for caution from Jayla's  
mother, and testimony from a caseworker at the Texas Youth 
Commission facility who said Lacresha had become more disruptive 
while in custody. 
</P>
<P>
	``Number one, I don't find Lacresha is a flight risk,'' Dietz  
said in his ruling. ``I believe that suitable care can be provided 
by her grandparents with certain restrictions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the 3rd District Court of Appeals remanded Lacresha's  
case to juvenile court, throwing out the conviction by saying the 
statement she gave police should not have been used at her trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said the statement -- in which the girl, after lengthy  
questioning, told investigators she might have dropped and kicked 
the little girl -- resulted from an illegal interrogation when the 
girl was ``isolated and alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case has been high-profile in the state capital, where  
dozens of protesters have gathered monthly outside the courthouse 
where the case was pending. 
</P>
<P>
	Columnist Bob Herbert of The New York Times also has championed  
her cause, writing several columns arguing that the supposed facts 
of the case don't add up. Herbert suggested that another relative 
might have beaten the child. 
</P>
<P>
	Other critics say District Attorney Ronnie Earle sought a  
conviction to help his re-election campaign or was biased against 
Lacresha because she is black. Earle is white. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosemary Lehmberg, first assistant district attorney, said  
prosecutors would almost certainly seek reconsideration of the 
reversal before the appellate court or ask the Supreme Court to 
look at it. 
</P>
<P>
	If needed, the case almost certainly will be retried, she said.

<HEADLINE> IBM Earnings Jump 42 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Soothing fears of slumping PC sales and Year  
2000 problems, IBM posted first-quarter earnings of $1.47 billion, 
a 42 percent increase from the year-ago period that easily 
surpassed analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	In the three months ended March 31, International Business  
Machines Corp. earned $1.55 a share, compared to earnings of $1.03 
billion, or $1.06 a share, in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had predicted earnings of  
$1.41 a share for the Armonk, N.Y.-based company. 
</P>
<P>
	First-quarter revenue rose 15 percent to $20.3 billion from  
$17.6 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM's shares soared $17 to $188 in trading on secondary markets  
following the report, which was released after the close of 
Wednesday's session on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock had 
risen $2.12 1/2 to $171.87 1/2 in regular NYSE trading. 
</P>
<P>
	A 17-point jump by IBM, one of the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones  
industrial average, could translate into a gain of more than 75 
points by Dow at the start of Thursday's NYSE trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst reaction was mostly positive, especially given the  
troubles at rival Compaq Computer Corp., which ousted its chief 
executive on Sunday after warning a week earlier that its 
first-quarter profit was only half as large as expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a pleasant surprise based on some of the past few days,''  
Salomon Smith Barney analyst John Jones said during a conference 
call with IBM. 
</P>
<P>
	While IBM officials credited software and service revenue for 60  
percent of their gross profit, the computer giant's report showed 
revenue strength across the board, and throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardware sales rose 17 percent to $8.6 billion, with PC sales  
rising 50 percent to $3.6 billion. Server performance was mixed, 
though IBM noted strong sales for its System/390 server. 
</P>
<P>
	Software sales for both IBM and non-IBM platforms rose 10  
percent to $2.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues from business services rose 19 percent to $7.6 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Chief financial officer Doug Maine said during the conference  
call that IBM had received nine service contracts worth nearly $10 
billion in the quarter -- including deals with AT&AMP;T Corp., CompUSA, 
Ford Motor Co. and Mitsubishi Trust -- and now has a contracts 
totaling $55 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman and chief executive Louis Gerstner said in a statement  
that the results -- which set first-quarter records for earnings per 
share, revenue and net income -- were a ``direct reflection of the 
power of the strategies we have put in place over the last few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Services is clearly the largest and fastest-growing portion of  
the information technology industry, and we continue to extend our 
leadership position in each quarter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IBM also said it will continue to explore direct sales over the  
Internet to businesses and consumers. Maine said that IBM expects 
to sell $10 billion to $15 billion in hardware, services and 
software directly over the Internet, as compared to $3.3 billion in 
all of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM experienced revenue growth throughout the world, rising 13  
percent in the Americas, 20 percents in the Europe/Middle 
East/Africa region, and a 20 percent rise in the Asia-Pacific 
region. Maine said, however, that the company still remains 
concerned about the ongoing economic struggles in the region -- 
especially in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Maine also said that IBM was not seeing any signs of a global  
slowdown in information technology sales, and that IBM had not 
experienced any fallout from the Year 2000 bug. ``We really saw no 
significant evidence in changes of customer buying pattern,'' he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the 12th straight quarter that IBM has exceeded Wall  
Street's consensus, said Chuck Hill, director of research at First 
Call.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Higher; Dow Up 48.40 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices moved higher Wednesday as investors  
returned to Internet and pharmaceutical issues that were beaten 
down earlier this week, and also picked up the shares of many 
smaller companies. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 48.40 at 10,496.95 , but had given back some of its gains after 
rising 105 points earlier in the session. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were pushed higher by the renewed  
interest in technology companies. The Nasdaq composite, heavily 
weighted in tech stocks, was up 52.30 at 2,461.94. The Standard &AMP; 
Poor's 500 index was up 16.50 at 1,322.67. 
</P>
<P>
	And small-company stocks were higher, pushing the Russell 2000  
average up 8.95 at 424.29. 
</P>
<P>
	The market continued to reverse Monday's sharp selloff in  
Internet shares. America Online was up 8 15/16 at 136 7/8 on the Big 
Board. Amazon.com was up 5 at 177 in Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks were also helped by Qualcomm, soaring 47 9/16  
at 188 3/16 in Nasdaq trading after the San Diego maker of 
digital-wireless technology company reported operating income of 82 
cents a share, well above analysts' expected 59 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	Big-company computer stocks, however, were struggling. Microsoft  
was down 2 at 81 1/8 after the software maker reported first-quarter 
earnings late Tuesday of 35 cents a share, beating analysts' 
expected 32 cents. But Microsoft warned that Year 2000 computer bug 
concerns could slow growth later in the year, and Prudential 
Securities downgraded the stock's rating to ``hold'' from 
``accumulate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq Computer today reported earnings of 16 cents a share, a  
penny higher than analysts' diminished expectations. The company, 
which recently ousted its chief executive, called its results 
``disappointing and unacceptable.'' Its stock fell 3/16 to 23 
13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was getting another look at the state of technology  
companies after the close of trading today, when IBM was expected 
to report its earnings. IBM, a Dow component, was off 1/16 at 169 
11/16 as traders waited for the news. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug stocks were helped by Bristol-Myers Squibb, whose shares  
were up whose shares were up 3 7/8 at 63 1/8 after the company reported 
first-quarter earnings that beat analysts' expectations by a penny. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola, whose shares were up 2 5/8 at 67 7/8 on the Big Board.  
</P>
<P>
	Advancers led decliners by 3 to 2 on the New York Stock  
Exchange, where volume came to 728 million shares, down from 
Tuesday's pace.

<HEADLINE> Virginia Race Track Faces Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- The Virginia Racing Commission put Colonial  
Downs on notice Wednesday that it could lose its license to operate 
the state's only parimutuel horse racing track. 
</P>
<P>
	Commission chair Robin Traywick Williams said the hearing will  
proceed even if Colonial Downs posts a $3.125 million bond for race 
prizes and reaches a contract agreement with thoroughbred horsemen. 
</P>
<P>
	In failing to meet an April 16 deadline to pay the bond,  
Colonial Downs ``flouted our order and flouted our authority, and 
we are going to look into that,'' Williams said. Last week a judge 
upheld a commission decision requiring Colonial Downs to post the 
bond. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing could result in revocation, suspension or a fine up  
to $100,000. No date for the hearing has been set but Williams said 
the commission could be ready to vote on Colonial Downs' license by 
its May 19 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey P. Jacobs, chairman of the New Kent County track, said  
Colonial Downs will post the $3.125 million bond on Thursday and 
has agreed to non-binding arbitration with the horse owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs said Williams was being ``extremely hostile to Colonial  
Downs'' and suggested the commission appears to be moving toward 
closing down the track. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the end is near for the track that opened less than two  
years ago, Williams said, ``The ball is in Jeff Jacobs' court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs said the commission was using the hearing as ``a big  
stick to maximize dollars the horsemen will receive from Colonial 
Downs. If anything, they're interfering with our legal right'' to 
negotiate with the horsemen. 
</P>
<P>
	``The commission needs to understand that Colonial Downs only  
has so many dollars,'' Jacobs said. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission gave Colonial Downs a week to reach a new  
contract with the Horsemen's Protective and Benevolent Association. 
The old contract expired at the end of 1998, ``and 3 1/2 months is 
long enough to go'' without a new one, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodberry Payne, president of the Virginia affiliate of the  
HPBA, was pessimistic an agreement could be reached. ``There has 
been no real movement in the negotiations since the beginning of 
the year,'' he told the commission.

<HEADLINE> Italy, Germany Telecom Deal OK'd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Telecom Italia SpA on Wednesday formally accepted  
a proposal to merge with Deutsche Telekom AG, agreeing to what 
could be the biggest corporate merger in history. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, which would create the world's second-largest  
telecommunications company, came after Telecom Italia's board of 
directors received assurances from the German government that it 
would not interfere with the new firm's business operations. 
</P>
<P>
	A Telecom Italia official, speaking from Rome on condition of  
anonymity, confirmed that the company's board met today and 
approved a linkup of the two former state-run monopolies. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom's board had agreed in principle to the merger on  
Tuesday, but was awaiting clarification on how the German 
government would reduce its controlling interest in what would be 
Europe's biggest telecommunications concern. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the deal, such as the respective shares Deutsche  
Telekom and Telecom Italia would have in the merged company, were 
not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom officials in Bonn did not immediately respond  
to phone calls seeking comment on Telecom Italia's approval of the 
merger agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's Finance Ministry, the majority shareholder in Deutsche  
Telekom, had advised the Italian Treasury earlier today that it 
would refrain from dominating the activities and corporate 
structure of the merged business. 
</P>
<P>
	``The (German) government's philosophy is not to interfere with  
management decisions'' of privatized companies, ministry spokesman 
Torsten Albig told reporters in Bonn. ``We believe this creates a 
basis for further negotiations between the two companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The assurance was aimed at easing Italian concerns that the  
merger would amount to a takeover by the German government of 
Italy's flagship telephone company. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia, which has been negotiating with Deutsche Telekom  
to thwart a hostile takeover bid from smaller Italian rival 
Olivetti SpA, did not disclose any financial details of the deal it 
favored. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Telecom Italia official, who spoke by telephone from  
Rome on condition of anonymity, said the board decided Tuesday that 
the German government can keep its 72 percent stake in Deutsche 
Telekom, but would need to limit its voting rights after the 
merger. 
</P>
<P>
	With combined revenues of about $63 billion, a merged company  
would ranks as the second largest telecommunications firm in the 
world after Japan's NTT, which posted sales last year of $69 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	A merged company could also have a market value of nearly $200  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, Deutsche Telekom has a market capitalization of about  
$117 billion while Telecom Italia is worth about $77 billion. A 
merger of the two could exceed the value of the pending deal 
between Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp., which was worth about $85 
billion based on the Exxon's recent stock price. 
</P>
<P>
	By linking up, the two former state-run monopolies would create  
a telecommunications behemoth that would dwarf its competitors in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	However, several major issues still must be resolved. The  
biggest hurdle appears to be agreement on how the two partners will 
share ownership of the combined company. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, the German government's 72 percent stake is scheduled  
to fall to 66 percent once the German company issues more stock in 
midsummer. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia stipulated that the merger agreement would have  
to be ``substantially a merger of equals,'' and it did not specify 
what weight each company would have in a new holding company to be 
set up to combine the two firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts have speculated that Deutsche Telekom would account for  
between 56 percent and 60 percent of the holding company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian government owns just 3.4 percent of Telecom Italia,  
but its so-called golden share gives it veto power over major 
decisions like mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	One way of closing the ownership gap would be for the German  
government to reduce its voting rights, the Telecom Italia official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	That would enable the German government to avoid a quick sale of  
a sizeable percentage of its shares. The government is prohibited, 
in any case, from selling the bulk of its stake -- 48 percent of 
Deutsche Telekom shares -- before the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> Senators Discuss Internet Privacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Companies doing business on the Internet are  
coming up with creative ways to protect the privacy of their 
customers, but some sort of federal regulation appears inevitable, 
members of the Senate Judiciary Committee said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers have introduced more than 50 bills so far to protect  
Internet surfers from such things as having personal information 
passed from company to company, committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, 
R-Utah, said. The industry should do its best to regulate itself if 
it wants to head off restrictive legislation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last thing you want is for us to come in with a heavy hand  
... and that's where it's headed,'' Hatch told a panel of industry 
representatives testifying before the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said he was reassured by the  
privacy policies described by the panel, but still concerned about 
less reputable companies that don't care about safeguarding 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``By definition a bad actor doesn't submit to self- or industry  
regulation,'' Schumer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., agreed, saying, ``The jury is  
still out on self-regulation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, business leaders appearing before the committee said they  
believed market forces supply more than enough incentives for 
business to protect privacy. The best solution was public education 
and leaving the industry to police itself -- or risk losing 
customers who don't trust Internet security, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, the Internet is too young, too complicated and  
changing too quickly for lawmakers to know what laws would work 
best, said Irving Wladawsky-Berger, IBM Corp.'s Internet division 
general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels like every month something new develops,'' he told  
the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``A new statute is not the answer,'' Wladawsky-Berger said. ``It  
would be relatively easy, I suspect, for some to fall into the trap 
of thinking that enacting a simple statute that tries to make those 
who operate on the Internet, through whatever means, respect 
privacy'' would solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online worries about companies that may undermine  
efforts at self-regulation, ``but we worry more about legislation 
that is too quick,'' said Katherine Borsecnik, an America Online 
senior vice president. ``I worry that that will be viewed as 
shortsighted in retrospect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wladawsky-Berger said many privacy problems that have developed  
involve acts that already are illegal. Extending current law to 
cover the Internet would stop many of them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., introduced a bill Wednesday that  
would extend Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable 
government searches and seizures to networked computer 
environments. 
</P>
<P>
	``In addition, several provisions in the bill will address the  
concern Americans have about the use of their personally 
identifiable records and information by businesses, satellite 
carriers, libraries and book sellers,'' Leahy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., said he and Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio,  
were working on legislation that would create a commission to study 
Internet privacy problems.

<HEADLINE> Knicks Boot Team President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In a front office shakeup curious for its  
timing, Ernie Grunfeld took the fall today for the problems 
surrounding the New York Knicks as he was removed as president and 
general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts, acknowledging a  
rift between Grunfeld and coach Jeff Van Gundy, will take over the 
day-to-day operations for the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The organization has not functioned well together,'' Checketts  
said. ``With what we've spent on salaries and what we've done as an 
organization, to be a .500 club and in ninth place is unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	``The organization was not on the same page in a lot of  
categories. I was not going to accept any more divisions, people on 
different pages, people looking like they had different agendas. We 
have one agenda -- to make the playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shakeup comes with just eight games left in the regular  
season and the Knicks, with an NBA-high $63 million payroll, on a 
season-high four-game losing streak. At 21-21, the Knicks are ninth 
in the Eastern Conference and in danger of missing the playoffs for 
the first time in more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement of Grunfeld's reassignment came after the team  
held a 2 1/2-hour practice in Purchase, N.Y. Afterward, the players 
were spirited away to a meeting at which Checketts told them of the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought stuff would happen after the season, but I'm not  
necessarily shocked,'' center Chris Dudley said. ``In this 
business, you never know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The timing of it is a little ironic,'' said Latrell Sprewell,  
who was fined $25,000 by Checketts for comments made by his agent, 
Robert Gist, that appeared Wednesday in the New York Post. The 
agent ripped Van Gundy and Grunfeld and said Sprewell would demand 
to be traded if the Knicks planned to bring him off the bench again 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if there would be any changes to the starting lineup  
Friday night against Charlotte, Van Gundy said: ``I don't know. 
We'll see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition of Sprewell was one of several major moves made  
by Grunfeld that have not panned out. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's GM and president since 1996 and a member of the front  
office since 1990, Grunfeld was one of the most aggressive 
executives in the league when it came to making trades. 
</P>
<P>
	The past four seasons have been marked by substantial turnover  
on the roster. Yet each year, the club has been knocked out in the 
second round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Grunfeld's latest moves were the ones for which he has taken the  
most heat. 
</P>
<P>
	He traded the team's most popular player and hardest worker,  
Charles Oakley, to Toronto for Marcus Camby. He also traded John 
Starks, Chris Mills and Terry Cummings to Golden State for 
Sprewell. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell and Camby have not fit in with the Knicks, and both are  
unhappy coming off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	New York has played inconsistently all season, losing to teams  
it is supposed to beat and suffering numerous breakdowns in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation has been rampant about the futures of Grunfeld and  
Van Gundy, and Checketts' own job security has been brought into 
question, too. The Knicks, along with the New York Rangers of the 
NHL, are owned by Cablevision Systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Checketts said the reassignment of Grunfeld does not mean Van  
Gundy's job is any more secure. The coach, who was not available 
for comment after Grunfeld's reassignment was announced, has one 
year remaining on his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no winners in today's announcement, there's no power  
struggle won by anybody, and no, it's not a show of confidence in 
anybody,'' Checketts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is that all of the steps that we have taken as an  
organization were not paying off. We're not getting the kind of 
results from those steps that we deserve. So I asked (Grunfeld) to 
accept a different role so that over the next eight games and 
playoffs I can get a good view of what's going wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``This move today was about allowing me to get the information I  
need to make judgments in the offseason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grunfeld's new title will be special consultant.  
</P>
<P>
	Checketts said a new team president would be named in the  
offseason.

<HEADLINE> Groups Seek To Clean Up Miss. River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- To reduce polluted runoff into waterways in  
the upper Mississippi River region, an unusual coalition of 
environmentalists, barge interests, farmers and researchers are 
seeking $1.1 billion in federal funds over the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	At stake, the group said Wednesday, is the future transportation  
of the 90 million tons of cargo on the Mississippi, as well as the 
region's $1.2 billion recreation industry, drinking water quality 
and important habitats for over 400 species. 
</P>
<P>
	``The long-term outlook for the Mississippi River is not very  
rosy,'' said Barry Drazkowski, co-director of the Winona, 
Minn.-based Resources Studies Center, which assembled the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The coalition now must lobby lawmakers for federal funding --  
$110 million a year, for each of the next 10 years, which would 
represent a 40 percent increase over current annual spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wis., co-chairman of Congress' Upper  
Mississippi River Task Force, said the coalition needs solid 
promises of funding from the states in the watershed before the 
proposal will find much support in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't get cooperation and commitment at the state and  
local level, it's not going to go very far,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan grew out of a collaboration between environmental  
groups and barge interests to find a compromise in addressing the 
river's needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the river's chief problems are:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Sediment buildups in backwater areas are suffocating  
underwater plants, depriving fish of food and shelter, and clogging 
navigation channels, which then require costly dredging. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Fertilizer and other pollutants flowing from farmland and new  
residential developments are contaminating the water. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal calls for expanding federal programs that give  
farmers technical advice about making crop production more 
environmentally friendly and pay them to change their farming 
practices. All participation would remain voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal also says federal agencies should have more  
flexibility to target areas most in need of help, even a single 
stream or farm. That means greater cooperation between the 75 
local, state, federal and private programs now working to improve 
the river. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some places we're spending too much money ... and in some  
places we're spending no money,'' said Scott Faber with American 
Rivers, one of the leading groups in the effort. ``It sounds crazy, 
but we've never stepped back and asked ourselves how we can best 
spend our resources in the upper Mississippi region.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Won't Block CBS Broadcast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- A federal judge refused to block CBS's  
planned telecast Wednesday night of a hidden-camera report on 
alleged dangerous conditions and falsified records at a psychiatric 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Charter Behavioral Health Systems, which runs 91 hospitals in 32  
states, accused CBS of violating patient confidentiality by sending 
a worker into a Charter facility in Charlotte with a tiny camera on 
his eyeglasses. 
</P>
<P>
	The health group's request for a temporary restraining order was  
denied just hours before the segment was to air on CBS' ``60 
Minutes II.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Using the hidden camera, clinical worker Terrance Johnson  
allegedly documented cases of falsified records and patient 
mistreatment, such as a physically restrained boy left gasping and 
crying. 
</P>
<P>
	In arguing its case, CBS News officials said patient  
confidentiality was not compromised by the ``60 Minutes II'' report 
because the faces of those filmed were blurred and their voices 
altered. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite that, attorneys for the health system said several  
patients were worried they might be identified in the report. 
</P>
<P>
	``Simply blackening out their faces and disguising their voices  
won't prevent a patient's family and friends from recognizing that 
person,'' said Karen Popp, an attorney for Charter. ``Their 
identities will be exposed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Wester, another Charter attorney, said CBS committed a  
crime by using the hidden camera. He said the program also violated 
patients' privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no doubt that when an individual enters a psychiatric  
hospital, the events that occur are his or her private matters,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS attorney Lee Levine said the report needed to be broadcast  
because it raised important questions about the quality of care at 
psychiatric hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Graham Mullen expressed concerned that laws  
might have been broken in assembling the hidden-camera report, but 
said he had no choice but to deny the motion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears to this court that the Supreme Court has elevated  
press powers to the point where prior restraint is all but 
impossible to obtain, even when the press sets out to commit a 
crime,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, the press is not free to commit a crime ... but  
even if they did, it does not give me the opportunity to shut it 
down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charter attorneys said they weren't sure if they would appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	The dispute with CBS comes two years after a North Carolina jury  
ordered ABC to pay $5.5 million for using the technique in an 
investigation of the Food Lion supermarkets. The award later was 
reduced to $315,000 and is still under appeal.

<HEADLINE> Mariners, Angels' Players Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Anaheim's Todd Greene and Seattle rookie pitcher  
Brett Hinchliffe were suspended for three games each today by the 
American League for last weekend's brawl. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene charged the mound after being hit in the fourth inning  
Sunday night by Hinchliffe, who had just given up a homer to Troy 
Glaus that cut the Mariners' lead to 5-3. Seattle went on to win 
8-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene and Hinchliffe exchanged punches and were ejected along  
with Angels pitcher Tim Belcher. On Friday, Glaus had been hit by a 
Jamie Moyer pitch and Greene connected on the next pitch for a 
grand slam in a 9-5 Angels' win. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene had the players' association appeal the penalty, meaning  
he can continue to play pending a hearing before AL president Gene 
Budig. Hinchliffe declined to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Both players were also fined.

</P>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- Louis Cohen, who helped build a  
Charleston pharmacy into a chain of more than 40 drug stores, died 
Tuesday. He was 93. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen built Cohen Drug Co. with the help of brothers Saul and  
Marvyn. The stores were sold to the Rite Aid Corp. in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	He was former chairman of the visiting committee of the West  
Virginia University School of Pharmacy and honorary chairman of the 
campaign to build a new WVU Pharmaceutical Center in Morgantown.

	TORONTO (AP) -- William ``Flash'' Hollett, the first National  
Hockey League defenseman to score 20 goals, died Tuesday. He was 
88. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollett played for the Ottawa Senators, Toronto Maple Leafs,  
Boston Bruins and Detroit Red Wings between 1933 and 1946. He set 
the 20-goal mark in 1944-45 in Detroit, and it stood until being 
broken by Bobby Orr 24 years later. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollett, nicknamed ``Flash'' for his speed, scored the winning  
goal in the Stanley Cup final on April 16, 1939, to give the Bruins 
a 3-1 win over Toronto. He retired in 1946.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Andrew J. Loyla, who was principal flutist of  
the New York City Ballet Orchestra for nearly three decades and 
also played for other top companies, died Saturday of cancer. He 
was 68. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the City Ballet, Loyla was also principal flutist  
for the Joffrey and Royal ballets, as well as the Bolshoi and Kirov 
companies, when they performed in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	After graduation from the Julliard School of Music, Loyla  
quickly picked up work with various New York orchestras as well as 
playing film scores and commercial music. 
</P>
<P>
	He had the distinction of playing alto flute with Igor  
Stravinsky for the Russian-born composer's orchestral piece ``The 
Rite of Spring.''

<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Former Mayor Ralph J. Perk, whose burning hair  
and borrowing to balance the budget came to symbolize a city in 
decline, died Wednesday of cancer. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Perk, a Republican who was popular in Cleveland's traditionally  
Democratic ethnic neighborhoods, was mayor from 1972-77. 
</P>
<P>
	The former city councilman and county auditor was defeated for  
re-election in 1977, one year before Cleveland became the first 
major U.S. city to default on its financial obligations since the 
Depression. 
</P>
<P>
	The city, its manufacturing base hurt by the recession in the  
1970s, borrowed almost $130 million to pay its bills during Perk's 
term. 
</P>
<P>
	Perk, who had been elected on an anti-tax platform, cut the  
hours and pay of city employees 10 percent to balance the budget. 
City clerks, trash collectors and non-teaching school employees all 
went on strike during his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
	A lasting image of his administration was created when Perk, who  
was using a blowtorch during a ceremonial event as mayor, 
accidentally ignited his hair. 
</P>
<P>
	Perk was a favorite of President Richard Nixon. On one occasion  
when the mayor and his wife were invited to a White House dinner, 
Lucy Perk begged off because it was her bowling night.

</P>
<P>
	RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. (AP) -- Actor and bandleader Charles  
``Buddy'' Rogers, star of the first film to win the best-picture 
Oscar who was married to screen legend Mary Pickford, died 
Wednesday. He was 94. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers made his screen debut in 1926 with Paramount's  
``Fascinating Youth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A year later, as the silent-movie era waned, Rogers starred in  
``Wings,'' playing a small-town boy who becomes a World War I pilot 
only to accidentally shoot down his best friend. The film took 
Hollywood's top honor at the first Academy Awards ceremony in May 
1929. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers married Miss Pickford after her marriage to fellow  
superstar Douglas Fairbanks fell apart in the 1930s. He was married 
to her from 1936 until her death in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	While his wife's celebrity surpassed his own, Rogers had roles  
in films such as ``Young Eagles,'' ``This Way Please'' and 
``Mexican Spitfire's Baby,'' earning the nickname ``America's 
Boyfriend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Pickford ended her film career after only a handful of  
talking films, but Rogers remained active on screen through the 
'30s and early '40s. 
</P>
<P>
	After television arrived, he became a regular on the ``Cavalcade  
of Bands'' on the Dumont network in 1951.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Liz Tilberis, a fashion editor who used her  
public platform at Harper's Bazaar to raise awareness of ovarian 
cancer, died Wednesday of the disease. She was 51. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Tilberis, who was editor in chief of Harper's Bazaar and,  
before that, editor in chief of British Vogue, was diagnosed with 
cancer in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	She helped raise money for a cure as president of the Ovarian  
Cancer Research Fund and described her battle with the disease last 
year in a memoir, ``No Time to Die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Tilberis became editor in chief at Harper's Bazaar in 1992.  
She introduced more art features and high-quality fashion 
journalism, and brought on board internationally renowned fashion 
photographers Patrick DeMarchelier and Peter Lindbergh. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Tilberis began her career as fashion editor in 1974 at  
British Vogue, where she placed her friend Princess Diana on the 
cover in 1990. And as editor in chief at Harper's, Tilberis 
featured Diana twice on the cover, in 1995 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	At British Vogue, Ms. Tilberis rose quickly, becoming executive  
fashion editor, editor in chief and finally director of Conde Nast 
Publications in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include her husband, Andrew Tilberis, and two sons.

<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Lucille Vore, who starred as ``Baby Lucille''  
in the original ``Our Gang'' comedy films, died April 8 of 
congestive heart failure, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. She 
was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	She was discovered at age 4 by a movie director as she daintily  
removed a pair of white gloves while riding on the San Diego 
Trolley. In 1920, she won the ``Our Gang'' role after she was 
chosen over 400 little girls. 
</P>
<P>
	Dubbed ``Baby Lucille,'' Ms. Vore was the youngest in the ``Our  
Gang'' cast, which was known for its on-screen mischief and ability 
to escape any serious consequences. 
</P>
<P>
	In the late 1920s, she appeared in three movies as a stand-in  
for Barbara Stanwyck, but left acting soon after to become a 
registered nurse. In 1970, she returned to star in a stage 
production of ``Little Murders'' at the Old Globe Theatre in San 
Diego.

<HEADLINE> Treasury Bond Prices Retreat / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *With BC-Bonds-Glance    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury bond prices edged lower Wednesday as  
oil prices rose in commodity markets and stocks rallied on Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 5/16  
point, or $3.13 cents per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which 
moves in the opposite direction, rose to 5.53 percent from 5.50 
percent late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A rise in oil futures prices to levels last seen in late 1997  
kept alive inflation worries in bond markets. In addition, a jump 
in the Dow Jones industrial average to a new high and its first 
close above 10,500 provided tough competition for bonds in vying 
for investors' dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
fell between 1/16 point and 5/32 point, and intermediate maturities 
fell between 3/16 point and 9/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.34 percent as the  
discount fell 0.04 percentage point from Tuesday to 4.23 percent. 
Six-month yields were 4.51 percent, as the discount fell 0.02 
percentage point to 4.35 percent. One-year yields were 4.65 percent 
as the discount rose by 0.01 percentage point from Tuesday to 4.44 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.38 percent from 4.44 percent late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose to 124 13/32 from 124 3/8 . The average 
yield to maturity was unchanged at 5.23 percent.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Half a continent away from the tragic scene,  
President Clinton and his Cabinet today mobilized what help they 
could offer grieving Littleton, Colo. -- and to ``hammer home to all 
the children of America that violence is wrong.''

and why,'' the president said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Education Flexibility Bill Passed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress moved toward passage of its first  
substantive legislation of the year Wednesday, a measure that would 
give states more freedom in how they spend federal education 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The House approved the ``Ed-Flex'' bill 368-57, and the Senate  
then took it up. President Clinton was expected to sign it. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, eager to show their commitment to education and  
other post-impeachment legislative priorities, hailed the House 
vote. To enhance the measure's chances, GOP leaders had to give up 
a major provision that exposed it to a presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would enable states and school districts to be released  
from some rules that ordinarily must be met to obtain federal 
funding. In exchange, they would have to set up their own programs 
under which they would be accountable for better educational 
results. 
</P>
<P>
	It would expand to all 50 states and the District of Columbia a  
demonstration program set up in 1994 that was limited to 12 states. 
</P>
<P>
	This Congress has passed a Republican budget outline for the  
coming fiscal year, but this would be the first major piece of 
legislation to go to Clinton for his signature. 
</P>
<P>
	While taking only a small step toward the Republican goal of  
returning more education money and responsibility to states and 
local school districts, GOP leaders praised the House action. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the last two years we had the most effective education  
effort in the history of the Congress of the United States,'' said 
Rep. William Goodling, R-Pa., chairman of the House Education and 
Workforce Committee. He cited this bill and legislation on 
vocational training, Head Start, charter schools and child 
nutrition, among others. 
</P>
<P>
	To avoid a presidential veto, a House-Senate conference  
abandoned a provision promoted by Senate Majority Leader Trent 
Lott, R-Miss., that Democrats said would undermine Clinton's drive 
to hire 100,000 new teachers to reduce class sizes. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott's measure would have let schools take some of the $1.2  
billion allocated for this year to hire some of the 100,000 
teachers and spend it instead on special education needs. In place 
of that, the bill says small districts with class sizes of 18 or 
fewer students may join with other districts to use the money for 
teacher training. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration, in a statement, said it ``has long  
supported the concept of expanding Ed-Flex demonstration authority 
in a manner that will promote high standards and accountability for 
results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To participate in the Ed-Flex program under the bill, states  
would have to apply to the Education secretary for a waiver from 
the normal rules, explaining what educational goals would be 
achieved and how progress toward those goals would be evaluated. 
The waiver could be revoked after three years if the secretary 
concludes the state is not meeting its objectives. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe it will provide schools and their students with the  
tools to improve academic achievement,'' said Rep. Michael Castle, 
R-Del., who co-sponsored the bill with Rep. Tim Roemer, D-Ind. ``It 
allows local schools and districts to think outside the box.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some Democrats said they opposed the trend of reducing the  
federal role in improving performance in public schools, 
particularly in poorer school districts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Education Committee's ranking Democrat, Rep. William Clay of  
Missouri, said it opened ``unprecedented loopholes for states and 
school districts to avoid their obligations to serve poor school 
children first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., pointed to the school shooting  
outside Denver as indicative of the ``tremendous social problems'' 
that schools face and the need to give them the flexibility to deal 
with them. ``We in Washington shouldn't tell them how to do it.''

<HEADLINE> Groening Tips America's Sacred Cows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- At first glance, he's living an unexceptional  
Chamber of Commerce existence: league bowling on the weekends, 
singing in a barbershop quartet and operating the best-known 
convenience store in metropolitan Springfield, USA. 
</P>
<P>
	But Apu Nahasapeemapetilon has a darker side: the chutney  
Squishees he once tried to force upon an unsuspecting populace. His 
role in the off-off-off-off-off-Broadway production of 
``Streetcar!'' (liberally adapted from Tennessee Williams). The 
flash-frozen senior citizen who once inhabited his dairy case. 
</P>
<P>
	You know Apu. He's a lot like you and me -- his successes pinned  
proudly to his polyester Kwik-E Mart frock, his failures stashed 
furtively under the counter behind the food-service cans of 
Reagan-era nacho cheese. 
</P>
<P>
	Except Apu exists only in a cosmos of pen and ink, of bright  
yellows and popping eyes. He's a member of an unusual animated 
flock, sprung from the mind of an even more unusual genius: the man 
whose brain produced ``The Simpsons'' -- and the new sci-fi cartoon 
``Futurama''; the man whose pointed humor has, for more than a 
decade, made lots of people laugh and lots of people uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have a particular ax to grind,'' he insists.  
</P>
<P>
	So instead, with smiles and jabs and idealism and sarcasm, Matt  
Groening grinds them all. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Utterances by Homer Simpson, fatty foods aficionado, errant  
nuclear-plant employee and incompetent if loving father: 
</P>
<P>
	--''I used to rock and roll all night and party every day. Then  
it was every other day. Now I'm lucky if I can find half an hour a 
week in which to get funky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--''Maybe, for once, someone will call me `sir' without adding,  
`You're making a scene.''' 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``Ooh! Barbecue!''  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	One day, somewhere in the middle of the baby boom, a young boy  
in a sandbox looked around at his playmates. Suddenly, he saw their 
futures: lawyers, investment bankers, grown-ups in grown-up suits. 
And Matt Groening realized being a kid wasn't such a bad gig. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew that other kids were going to get serious and go on and  
be professionals,'' says Groening (rhymes with ``raining''). ``I 
never wanted to go to an office and carry a briefcase. I said, 
`That's no fun. I want to play. I want to make up stories.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Four decades later, at 45, he still does.  
</P>
<P>
	He made up ``Life in Hell,'' a weekly comic strip that  
chronicles the travails of a rabbit named Binky and a nihilistic 
gay couple in fez hats named Akbar and Jeff. He created ``The 
Simpsons,'' the delightfully astute late 20th-century family sitcom 
and a winner of 12 Emmys. Now he has hatched ``Futurama,'' an 
equally offbeat cartoon that blends ``The Simpsons'' with ``The 
Jetsons,'' ``The Three Stooges'' and a hodgepodge of sci-fi 
imagery. 
</P>
<P>
	Groening's vision, rounded out by a team of animators and  
writers from across the political spectrum, evokes many 
descriptions: absurdist theater; crackling cultural commentary; a 
vast collage of American pop and high culture; the rapid-fire 
dialogue of Marx Brothers movies and the lunacy of Warner Bros. 
cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardly Saturday-morning ``Josie &AMP; the Pussycats'' or ``Smurfs''  
fare. View an episode of ``The Simpsons'' and watch the background. 
Little treats abound -- rewards, Groening says, for paying 
attention. Hidden in plain view are indictments of consumerism, 
jabs at bureaucracy and pokes at pretension. It is, quite simply, 
adult. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider these recent nuggets: an art museum named ``Louvre --  
American Style'' (``No shirt, no shoes, no Chardonnay''); an 
unrepentantly carnivorous steakhouse with a slab of beef called 
``Sir Loinalot'' and a Heimlich machine in case of emergency; a 
sign that says, ``Welcome to Atlanta -- Home of Ted Turner's mood 
swings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Groening and his writers (his official title is executive  
producer, but he retains great creative control) push to the edge 
of hilarity but never complete implausibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of television shows ... don't deal with the things  
people are ashamed to admit. We can do that,'' says Dan 
Castellaneta, who voices Homer Simpson and an array of other 
characters, including belching barfly Barney Gumble and 
flame-bearded, Scottish-brogued Groundskeeper Willie. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the first television show that has an underground comic  
sensibility,'' Castellaneta says in a decidedly un-Homeric voice. 
``Very rarely do people talk about major corporations and companies 
taking away people's rights. In `The Simpsons,' it just sneaks in 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the exclusionary in-jokes of ``Seinfeld,'' Groening's  
work is both accessible and deliciously obscure: Baby Maggie's 
attempt to break out of a day-care center would be hilarious even 
if it didn't feature the theme from ``The Great Escape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ridiculing mass media is a ``Simpsons'' staple. Local TV news is  
skewered with glee, as are violent cartoons: ``The Itchy and 
Scratchy Show,'' a cat-and-mouse cartoon within a cartoon, features 
graphic dismemberment and titles like ``Scar Trek: The Next 
Laceration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even Groening's own network isn't safe. One episode featured  
Homer and Bart watching ``Nonstop Fox,'' featuring ``When Buildings 
Collapse'' and ``World's Funniest Tornados.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what we all share is laughing at the Elmer Fudds of  
the world -- authorities who don't like to be laughed at,'' Groening 
says of his writers. 
</P>
<P>
	This notion -- that no cow is sacred -- renders the Simpsons  
affectionately benign. Sure, Apu is a broad parody of an Indian 
convenience-store owner, but Homer is an equally broad parody of a 
second-rate suburban white American father. In the end, everybody's 
good, everybody's bad and everybody's a bit ridiculous -- sort of 
like real life. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes you reflect and say, `Yeah -- that's me too. I've been  
there,''' says Cherie Kerr, a founding member of the Groundlings, 
the West Coast comedy troupe that has produced such favorite 
``Simpsons'' guest voices as Jon Lovitz and the late Phil Hartman. 
``But it's in an animated form, and that makes it less 
in-your-face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such humor is bound to raise hackles, though, and producers of  
``The Simpsons'' have become accustomed to strong reactions; last 
month's episode of Simpsons-spun Bible stories elicited more. 
</P>
<P>
	Early on, Bart annoyed people most; schoolteachers said his  
``underachiever and proud of it'' attitude fostered mediocrity and 
rebelliousness. Now, Homer's bathetic travails dominate the show 
and he has become a target. U.S. Rep. Joseph Pitts, a conservative 
Pennsylvania Republican, recently blamed Homer and his ilk for 
contributing to the decline of fatherhood in America. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are really missing the boat on this,'' says Robert  
Thompson, director of the Center for the Study of Popular 
Television at Syracuse University. ``If I had a choice between an 
8-year-old watching a literate, artistic, densely packed comedy 
like the Simpsons or one of these supposedly friendly, 
family-oriented `TGIF' programs like `Full House,' tell me which is 
worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Simpsons could serve for a kid today what Mad magazine did  
for me,'' Thompson says. ``It awakened a political consciousness, 
made me realize I could read something and have an opinion about it 
-- all the useful intellectual tools you get from reading satire.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Signs seen around Springfield:  
</P>
<P>
	--''Join the Army -- and see the opposing Army!''  
</P>
<P>
	--''Mt. Swartzwelder Historic Cider Mill: Now 40 percent  
quainter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--''Wall E. Weasel's Pizzeria/Arcade: We cram fun down your  
throat.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa and Maggie are his sisters, Homer and Marge his parents. He  
favors sarcasm and cutting repartee, but his mischief is 
good-natured. He distrusts authority. He seems forever young. 
</P>
<P>
	Not Bart. Matt.  
</P>
<P>
	Groening, who names characters after relatives (``Life in Hell''  
also features his sons, Will and Abe, depicted as rabbits), says he 
aimed to create a universe where people screw up but must rely upon 
each other to survive, where ``you can have a great life if you're 
second best -- or in Homer's case, in last place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The characters in `The Simpsons' love their lives, and Homer  
loves his life more than anyone,'' Groening says on a recent day 
from the Los Angeles offices of ``Futurama.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He follows his passions 100 percent. It gets him into a lot of  
trouble, but there's a part of us that wishes we had the guts to be 
like Homer and really savor that doughnut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Savoring, whether doughnuts or life, is what Groening's work is  
about. He still can't believe he's making a living at an activity 
that people warned would be his downfall. 
</P>
<P>
	During high school in the late 1960s and early '70s, the  
Portland, Ore., native watched as music and film and underground 
comics flourished. He absorbed popular culture like a sheet of 
Bounty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a perfect age to turn out the way I did,'' Groening says.  
</P>
<P>
	After college, he photocopied his own cartoon magazine, ``Life  
in Hell.'' It became his first success and today is syndicated 
nationally. He got his world view moving from job to job: 
record-store clerk, movie extra, chauffeur and dishwasher -- ``the 
standard stuff you do when you're trying to live by your wits and 
nobody's hiring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1987, Tracey Ullman enlisted Groening to do a few shorts  
about a dysfunctional family called the Simpsons for her variety 
show. Those first tries were rough, angular versions of the 
rounded-out family we know today. 
</P>
<P>
	The humor stuck, and the Simpsons' own show debuted in December  
1989 and became a regular series the following month. It succeeded 
in part because Groening, a media junkie, drew from myriad cultural 
sources -- high, middle and lowbrow -- for his humor. Everybody 
understood something. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything he likes, he's willing to twist into his version,''  
says longtime collaborator David X. Cohen, co-executive producer of 
``Futurama,'' which debuted last month with a similar sensibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``Futurama,'' as absurdist and caustic as ``The Simpsons,'' is  
more ambitious. Groening and Cohen wanted to create a distinctive 
future that could accommodate both comedy and science fiction. But 
how to design it? A happy, cornball Jetsons utopia or a dark, 
drippy, smelly ``Blade Runner'' landscape? 
</P>
<P>
	They compromised.  
</P>
<P>
	``We decided it should be a dark, drippy, cartoony, smelly  
Jetsons utopia,'' Cohen says. 
</P>
<P>
	Like much sci-fi, ``Futurama'' deals with other times and  
places, making sensitive issues seem more oblique than in the 
Simpsons. As Katey Sagal puts it, ``there is no politically correct 
in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sagal (``Married ... With Children'') voices Leela, the  
tough-but-sexy alien ship captain in ``Futurama.'' Despite her 
large and only eye, Leela is a 31st-century woman balancing career 
and love. Fry (Billy West, who voiced both Ren and Stimpy) is a 
pizza delivery boy cryogenically frozen for a millennium, coping 
with a not-so-brave new world. Together with a cast of 
neo-Springfieldian oddballs, they face life. 
</P>
<P>
	Theirs is a cosmos ruled by DOOP (the Democratic Order of  
Planets), where a wisecracking alcoholic robot lives among humans, 
the moon is a theme park and New Yorkers commute in pneumatic 
tubes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Futurama'' has its melancholy side, too: Fry walks through  
what was Manhattan's Rockefeller Center and sees the ancient ruins 
of his 20th-century world. His face falls. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's just this human quality to everybody, this  
vulnerability,'' Sagal says. 
</P>
<P>
	With all the famous voices ``The Simpsons'' has featured, from  
Paul McCartney to Rod Steiger to Michelle Pfeiffer, Groening 
anticipates and welcomes celebrity appearances on ``Futurama.'' One 
catch: This is an era where famous people's brains are kept alive 
in a disembodied head museum. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ``Futurama'' premiere, Leonard Nimoy's voice speaks from  
his pickled head; he tells of living ``a life of quiet dignity,'' 
then sucks up some fish food dropped into his tank. The year 3000 
version of ``New Year's Rockin' Eve'' appears on TV -- with Dick 
Clark's head as host.

but usually latch onto something a bit less, what more can anyone 
really ask?

<HEADLINE> U.S. Going Without Pacific Carrier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is bringing in aircraft carriers  
and planes from around the globe to provide firepower for NATO 
airstrikes in Yugoslavia, taxing a military stretched thin by 
post-Cold War cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of that conflict and continuing tensions with Iraq,  
no aircraft carrier will be plying the Pacific until the fall 
unless an emergency requires a quick call-up. Air Force planes have 
gone on alert to handle any trouble in the Pacific area. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are stretched thin and there are places we don't have  
forces,'' Navy Adm. Archie Clemins, commander-in-chief of the 
Pacific fleet, said today at a military readiness hearing of a 
Senate Armed Services Committee panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Clemins and Navy Adm. J.P. Reason, commander-in-chief of  
the Atlantic fleet, said they were deploying battle groups without 
all the needed sailors aboard because of personnel shortages. They 
also said there aren't enough spare parts for ships and aircraft, 
which could hurt future readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	Reason said he was also concerned about not quickly replacing  
the Tomahawk cruise missiles used in Yugoslavia. The Navy had about 
1,000 of the $1 million weapons before the conflict began. He 
wouldn't say how many have been used so far. 
</P>
<P>
	``All fleet units are still today fit to fight ... but I would  
be more comfortable with a few more arrows in my quiver,'' Reason 
told lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The admirals said it would be tough for the U.S. armed forces to  
handle more than one conflict at a time given the strains now 
showing. Said Reason: ``If we have some other flare-up in the 
world, then we're a little short.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The USS Kitty Hawk had been assigned to the Pacific on April 3  
but was ordered to the Persian Gulf to free up the USS Theodore 
Roosevelt to join NATO's Balkan campaign. The Roosevelt arrived 
April 5 in the Adriatic Sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the Pentagon is considering a second carrier for the allied  
forces to help meet a NATO request for 300 more American warplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	The USS Enterprise and its 75 aircraft, which reached the  
Mediterranean on Tuesday after a six-month Gulf deployment, could 
be sent to the Aegean Sea instead of home, U.S. defense officials 
said. More warplanes also could come from forces around Iraq and 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon also may base planes in Turkey and Hungary, both  
NATO members, which could eliminate the need for a second carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior defense official, describing the search for resources,  
said the U.S. military's flexibility is reduced since the Cold War, 
when the Navy had 600 ships, for example, compared with 324 today. 
The official spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, the Navy had 15 carriers, with one in reserve, which is  
just enough to keep one each in the three places the Pentagon would 
like to cover 365 days a year: the Persian Gulf, the Mediterranean 
and the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy has had just 12 carriers since 1994, however, which  
means gaps of weeks and sometimes months will occur when the 
Pacific, the Mediterranean or the Gulf goes without. 
</P>
<P>
	Maj. Gen. Charles Wald, a strategic planner for the Joint Chiefs  
of Staff, acknowledged that as NATO's air campaign continues, 
``Over time, it will take a little bit of a toll.'' But he said the 
shifting of carriers and aircraft demonstrates the flexibility of 
today's leaner military. 
</P>
<P>
	``We adjust our forces as necessary,'' Wald said. ``If an  
aircraft carrier moves, we can backfill that with aircraft, and 
vice versa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the U.S. military standoff with Iraq, which flared with  
four days of airstrikes in December, the Navy kept one or two 
aircraft carriers in the Gulf for 555 days in a row. That meant a 
gap in the Mediterranean and higher alert status for Air Force 
planes at Italy's Aviano air base, a major takeoff point for 
airstrikes now. 
</P>
<P>
	As Congress considers a $6.05 billion White House request to pay  
for NATO military and humanitarian activities in the Balkans, House 
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said the Kosovo crisis has shown 
that ``our troops are stretched too thin, and our defense 
capabilities are now grossly inadequate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leaving the Pacific unguarded by a carrier for long could send  
the wrong signal to North Korea, China or Indonesia, now 
experiencing violence ahead of elections, the first defense 
official said, because a visible U.S. military presence helps 
maintain stability. 
</P>
<P>
	If a crisis erupted in the Pacific, the Navy could deploy the  
USS Constellation within two to three weeks, defense officials 
said. The carrier's normal rotation would place it in the Pacific 
in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. military doctrine calls for the Pentagon to be prepared to  
fight two regional wars at the same time. Defense officials insist 
that remains possible, even with the U.S. armed forces trimmed to 
2.4 million active duty personnel and Reserves, compared with 3.8 
million in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	In times of conflict, presidents today rely more than they used  
to on the National Guard and Reserves. President Clinton is 
expected soon to call up as many as 33,000 of them, primarily to 
support the expected 300 additional U.S. warplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	Since NATO airstrikes began March 24, the Pentagon already has  
diverted planes from the Pacific command and from Iraq operations. 
Three hundred additional aircraft would bring the NATO force to 
about 1,000 planes, almost 800 of them American.

<HEADLINE> Shooting Comes Amid Colo. Gun Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The shooting rampage at a suburban Denver high  
school prompted state lawmakers to delay action on a bill that 
would help gun owners obtain concealed weapons permits. 
</P>
<P>
	Local government leaders have criticized the measure, which  
already has passed the state Senate. A House panel had planned to 
take up the measure today, but legislative leaders decided to 
postpone action in light of Tuesday's shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would require sheriffs to grant concealed weapons  
permits if applicants pass a number of conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Doug Dean, R-Colorado Springs, sponsor of the bill, said  
the Littleton tragedy might have been offset if a faculty member, 
or administrator, had been armed. 
</P>
<P>
	But Russell George, R-Rifle, said he had received calls  
expressing the opposite. 
</P>
<P>

you have guns? And you legislators are talking about allowing more 
guns in society, and here's the harm that comes,''' he said. 
</P>

	Under the Senate version of the bill, people couldn't carry  
their handguns on school grounds or into schools, government 
buildings or bars.

<HEADLINE> Gretzky Leaves NHL Playoffs in Wake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The people who run the National Hockey League spent almost as  
much time patting themselves on the back last weekend as saying 
goodbye to Wayne Gretzky. What they should been doing was looking 
over their shoulders instead. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no good time in the entertainment business to fall into  
bad habits, especially when the biggest draw is heading for the 
exits. And now might be the worst time of all. The playoffs begin 
this week, and the surest way to squander the goodwill The Great 
One left behind is for the league's showcase to serve up more of 
the thuggish, low-scoring defensive struggles that hastened his 
retirement in the first place. But the way things stand, that's 
what the NHL is likely to get. 
</P>
<P>
	If you heard this line once in all those tributes over the  
weekend, you heard it too many times: Gretzky changed the game. And 
he did. The problem is that sometime around the start of the 
decade, the game changed back. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky acknowledged as much Sunday when he said, ``Not only am  
I mentally ready to retire, I'm physically ready to retire, too. 
This is a great game, but it's a hard game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was reminded how hard just a few days earlier when, returning  
from a neck injury, he got hammered into the boards by 
Philadelphia's Luke Richardson and then crumpled to the ice like an 
empty suit. For a moment or two, Gretzky lay on his stomach, 
waiting for the whistle. When none was forthcoming, he picked 
himself up and hobbled to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	A decade earlier, when he was in his prime with Edmonton, the  
punishment for that kind of hit was swift and certain; the Oilers 
would have scored on the ensuing power play and later in the game, 
one of Gretzky's bodyguards would have turned Richardson inside. 
But no more. 
</P>
<P>
	Hockey was always a rough game at moments, but more and more  
that kind of play has become the norm. At the end of this season, 
Gretzky didn't just feel old, he looked the part, too. Nobody 
coming into the NHL these days would dare to wear the antique 
helmet he did, which was once described as a ``salad-spinner ... 
hockey's equivalent of a beret.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, no one ever scored or set up goals the way Gretzky  
did, either. But for a while, the rest of the league tried. Hockey 
was wonderful and wide-open then and Gretzky was the triggerman for 
a collection of speedsters that coach-general manager Glen Sather 
assembled in Edmonton. Like the great Soviet teams of the Olympic 
glory years, the Oilers always attacked. They swarmed opponents 
with a fast break or opened them up with rink-wide passes and 
one-touch puck movement, all of it orchestrated by Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody plays that way anymore. There is some argument about what  
caused the change: the ever-bigger bodies crammed into still-small 
rinks; a slavish devotion to defense, epitomized by the oft-copied 
offside trap; a dilution of the talent pool because of expansion. 
Whether it's one of those reasons, or more likely, all of them, 
there is no arguing with the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	The year before Gretzky joined the league, six teams scored 290  
or more goals in a season. By his 10th season, 13 teams did. This 
season, the highest total for a team was the 268 scored by Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	San Jose scored 196 goals and made the playoffs. Gretzky once  
had 92 by himself. He had eight seasons where he collected at least 
164 points. None of them, however, came after 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	It's comforting to think that maybe scoring is cyclical, that  
another era of wide-open hockey is nearby, just beyond where the 
Zamboni is idling. Our eyes tell us otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky's heir apparent, the player he made a point of saying  
had caught the torch, is Jaromir Jagr of the Penguins. Jagr scored 
the game-winner in overtime Sunday at Madison Square Garden and 
stands 6-foot-2 and weighs 230 pounds. There are still plenty 
gifted attackers who come in smaller or lighter than Gretzky did 
(6-0, 170 pounds), but Jagr increasingly looks like the prototype 
for the dominant players of the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the Flyers' Eric Lindros and Colorado's Peter Forsberg, he  
has the blend of size and skill necessary to operate -- and survive 
-- in today's slam-bam NHL. The problem is coming up with a 
supporting cast. 
</P>
<P>
	Viewed from that angle, expansion seems to be the single-biggest  
reason for the mess hockey has become. At the other end of the 
tunnel, for a view of what's possible, get hold of some videotapes 
from the Nagano Games. 
</P>
<P>
	There, international teams loaded with players of All-Star  
caliber player, or close, played on a rink that was 197 by 98 feet, 
compared with the NHL dimensions, 200 by 85. That meant an extra 
2,500 square feet or so to be exploited for creative purposes. It 
also meant less hitting for its own sake, since goons had to skate 
another two strides just to line up targets. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of teams won't shrink anytime soon and the rinks  
won't get any larger. Too bad. Who knows how long Gretzky would 
have stuck around if they had. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  Top Amateur Garcia Making Pro Debut  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- Sergio Garcia walked into his first news  
conference as a professional wearing a snappy suit with cameras 
clicking. The only thing missing Wednesday was a full-page 
newspaper advertisement that said, ``Hello, World.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Equipped with the most celebrated amateur career since Tiger  
Woods, the 19-year-old Spaniard who was the low amateur in the 
Masters makes his pro debut Thursday in the Peugeot Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a new page for me as a golfer, it's a new book.  
One that has no headings or records, the pages are still blank,'' 
Garcia said at the Golf Club of Prat. ``My move to professional 
golf will start from zero.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is the second European teen-ager in as many years to turn  
pro, only Garcia is expected to fare much better than Justin Rose. 
After his tie for fourth in the British Open last year, Rose 
immediately turned pro and hasn't made a cut in 18 tries. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia will be able to play seven European tour events this year  
to make enough money to avoid going to qualifying school. 
</P>
<P>
	He also is expected to use sponsor exemptions to play the Nelson  
Classic, the St. Jude Classic and the Sprint International on the 
PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never know what is going to happen,'' he said. ``But if I  
should win, it would be fantastic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That may sound like a big ambition. But then, the 19-year-old  
prodigy known as ``El Nino'' has always faced high expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	At 12, Garcia became the club champion at Mediterranean Golf  
Club, where is father is the pro. Two years later, he made the cut 
in his European PGA debut at the Mediterranean Open and became the 
youngest European Amateur Champion at 15. 
</P>
<P>
	He played his first British Open in 1996 and missed the cut at  
Royal Lytham and St. Annes. After the tournament, champion Tom 
Lehman handed Garcia the claret jug and told him, ``Someday you 
will win this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia won his first professional event at 17, the Catalonia  
Open on the Spanish PGA Tour. After winning the British Amateur 
last year, he came to American and finished third in a Nike Tour 
event in Greensboro, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The Peugeot Open is a perfect place for Garcia to make his pro  
debut. He set the European record last year in this tournament for 
having the lowest score by an amateur, an 11-under 277. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I have the game to win here, but I'm going to take it  
calmly and just enjoy the play,'' Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Peugeot Open also marks the first tournament for Jose Maria  
Olazabal since he won the Masters two weeks ago. Olazabal thought 
Garcia made the right decision to turn pro. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Sergio is a special player, and he's a long hitter  
with a great short game. I think he'll do well,'' Olazabal said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best thing for him will be that people leave him alone,  
let him play as many tournaments as he can and get as much as 
experience as he can without people putting a lot of expectations 
on him,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods turned pro in 1996 after winning his third straight U.S.  
Amateur and signed endorsements with Nike and Titleist worth about 
$60 million over five years. He repeated the words in the newspaper 
ad -- ``Hello, world'' -- at his news conference, then proceeded to 
win two tournaments in and won two tournaments in his eight starts 
that year. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager and family adviser Jose Marquina said Garcia has  
agreements with Acushnet to play the Titleist driver, Titleist ball 
and Cobra irons, and with Adidas to wear its shoes and apparel. 
</P>
<P>
	Where Garcia goes from there starts on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Unveil Medicare Drug Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Democrats proposed expanding  
Medicare to pay for prescription drugs. Republicans warned that the 
costly plan could bankrupt the program just when it needs to be 
financially strengthened to prepare for baby boom retirements. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are the resources available to put this program into  
place,'' said Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., who proposed the plan 
Tuesday with Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., and Reps. Pete Stark, 
D-Calif., Henry Waxman, D-Calif., and John Dingell, D-Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy said the funding options for the program, which would be  
government-funded but privately administered, include using part of 
the federal budget surplus or Medicare savings from reduced 
hospitalizations and treatments avoided by increased use of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	One government study put those savings at $16 billion to $25  
billion annually. Other options include a possible increase in the 
cigarette tax or recouping health care costs through a tobacco 
lawsuit being prepared by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the bill, which has no support from majority Republicans,  
private insurers or other companies would contract with the 
government to compete for Medicare beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Beneficiaries would pay the first $200 in drug costs. Medicare  
would pick up 80 percent of drug costs up to $1,500, after which 
beneficiaries would pay for their own drugs. But Medicare would 
kick in again, with full coverage, if drug costs exceeded $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Virtually all drug costs for the poor elderly -- those earning  
less than $10,392 for a single person or $13,111 for a couple -- 
would be covered. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, as well as many Republicans and Democrats,  
have voiced support for Medicare drug benefits. But the costs are 
daunting, especially since Medicare is expected to run short of 
cash when the first wave of baby boomers retire around 2010. 
</P>
<P>
	One government estimate found that even a modest benefit --  
having Medicare pay, for example, 75 percent of beneficiaries' drug 
bills -- would cost at least $20 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I recognize that low-income seniors need help in obtaining  
prescription drugs,'' said Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer, 
R-Texas. But he warned against ``creating an expensive benefit that 
could bankrupt the system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., chairman of Ways and Means' health  
subcommittee, said the plan ignores that 65 percent of seniors have 
drug coverage and could end up providing some older Americans with 
worse coverage than they now have. 
</P>
<P>
	But the American Association of Retired Persons said the  
Democratic proposal would help seniors who now pay for drugs out of 
pocket, buy expensive supplemental health insurance or join HMOs 
that offer drug benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicare, the government health insurance program for 39 million  
elderly and disabled Americans, has never paid for prescriptions.

<HEADLINE> Astros' Bagwell Homers Three Times </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Jeff Bagwell homered three times Wednesday  
against the Chicago Cubs, tying his best for home runs in a single 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Bagwell, who came in with just one home run this season, had a  
solo homer in the first, a three-run homer in the third and a 
two-run shot in the seventh. His six RBIs also tied a personal 
high. The only time he didn't homer was in the fifth inning, when 
he struck out swinging. 
</P>
<P>
	Bagwell also homered three times June 24, 1994, against the Los  
Angeles Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	The three home runs gave Bagwell 225 for his career, making him  
the Astros' career leader. He began the day tied with Jimmy Wynn, 
who hit 222 in his 11-year career (1963-73) with Houston. Bagwell 
also has a 10-game hitting streak.

<HEADLINE> Families Mourn Shooting Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Isaiah Shoels was shot in the head  
because he was the wrong color and in the wrong place at the wrong 
time -- a black man in the Columbine High School library at 11:30 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoels, 18, who dreamed of becoming a music executive, was  
killed Tuesday by two schoolmates, who then stood in an acrid cloud 
of gunsmoke and marveled at their grisly handiwork. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh my God. Look at this black kid's brain. Awesome, man!'' the  
killers said, according to witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said they didn't like niggers,'' sophomore Evan Todd, 15,  
told reporters after escaping the library. ``So they shot him in 
the face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shoels was the only black person among the 13 killed Tuesday by  
a pair of outcast classmates cloaked in black trench coats. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities had not released the names of the victims, but  
Shoels' and other deaths were confirmed Wednesday by family 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	Although witnesses said that the killers, Eric Harris and Dylan  
Klebold, were gunning for minorities, District Attorney Dave Thomas 
said there was no evidence to support that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've only seen the photographs, but it appears to me that most  
of the victims were victims because of where they were at a 
particular time, not that they were sought out,'' Thomas said. ``I 
don't know what the motive was other than anger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only adult among the victims was William ``Dave'' Sanders,  
47, a computer teacher and coach of the girl's basketball team. 
Students said Sanders, a grandfather of five, had been shot twice 
in the chest but managed to shepherd students down a hallway and 
away from danger. He stumbled into a science class, bleeding 
profusely and coughing blood. 
</P>
<P>
	For the next three hours, students covered him with their shirts  
and an emergency blanket they found in a first aid kit, and they 
kept talking to him in hopes he would rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Students said he grew cold and repeated, ``I'm not going to make  
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before turning their guns on themselves in the library, Harris  
and Klebold roamed the school, shooting randomly and laughing 
maniacally. They saved their worst for 45 students who were 
studying in the second-floor library. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Paul Cercle, a minister from Rochester, Ind., said his  
granddaughter, Rachel Scott, 17, was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a purely random shot,'' Cercle said. ``It would have to  
be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rachel's stepbrother, Craig Scott, 16, was in the library and  
survived the massacre only because he played dead in a friend's 
pool of blood. He later helped lead blood-spattered and frightened 
classmates to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Another victim, John Robert Tomlin, 16, was a sophomore who  
liked four-wheeling his run-down Chevy pickup and attending a youth 
group at a local church. 
</P>
<P>
	His father, John Tomlin, said the teen worked hard at his  
after-school job at a tree nursery and planned to join the Army 
after graduation. Last year he went on a missionary trip to Mexico 
with family and built a house for poor people. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a great kid, really happy, going to school, getting  
good grades,'' the elder Tomlin said. ``He knew what he wanted to 
do. He had everything planned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another parent, Neal DePooter, confirmed that his son, Corey  
DePooter, 17, was killed, but declined further comment. And KCNC-TV 
in Denver reported that Lauren Townsend, 18, was among the victims. 
She played on the volleyball team. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents of other victims huddled by their telephones Wednesday  
and held vigil at private shelters after gathering dental records 
and providing authorities with descriptions of their children's 
clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoels' father, Michael Shoels, told the television program  
``Inside Edition'' that his son had conquered health problems as a 
child, including a pair of heart surgeries. 
</P>
<P>
	Isaiah had ``a few confrontations'' in the predominantly white  
high school, but he had put those incidents behind him and was 
``outgoing,'' his father said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear whether the gunmen, or their friends in their  
dark group called the ``Trenchcoat Mafia,'' were involved in those 
incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel there were more responsible than the two parties in the  
school,'' Shoels said. ``The thing that happened could have been 
avoided. Someone had to know.''

<HEADLINE> Girls Head to Daughters to Work Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Philadelphia high school junior Diana Montanez spent just a day  
last year with executive assistant Sharri Reese, working telephones 
and logging onto the computer. Now they keep in touch, and Miss 
Montanez even asked her new mentor to serve as a reference. 
</P>
<P>
	The two aren't related, they first met last year. But Ms. Reese  
is one of thousands of workers who spend ``Take Our Daughters To 
Work Day'' -- this year on Thursday -- with girls who don't have a 
working parent or a parent whose workplace welcomes them. 
</P>
<P>
	Alongside the millions of parents who bring in their daughters  
for the day, now in its seventh year, these mentors give girls the 
gift of on-the-job learning and confidence-boosting. 
</P>
<P>
	Their efforts come as employers and women themselves are  
learning how crucial mentoring is not only for girls, but for 
enabling working women to grow and advance. Today, formal mentoring 
programs are burgeoning, offering for women what old-boys' networks 
do for men. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's becoming clear that while it's essential for advancement  
to do an excellent job, there's a lot more to it than that,'' said 
Sheila Wellington, president of the nonprofit organization 
Catalyst, which helps business women advance. ``If women recognize 
this, so do their employers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Reese and Miss Montanez were brought together by One to One,  
a 9-year-old nonprofit group that provides mentors for children in 
Philadelphia, where 40 percent of public school students drop out 
of high school. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Montanez, the daughter of a fork-lift operator, had visited  
an office only once before spending the day with Ms. Reese at her 
Sunoco office. But the visit changed the girl's dreams. 
</P>
<P>
	``After school, I was planning to just look for a job, do  
anything,'' the 18-year-old said between classes Tuesday. ``When I 
went there, I thought I'd like to work for a company. That sounds 
more interesting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sixteen-year-old Jacqueline Lovelace will spend her first  
Daughters to Work day Thursday with Philadelphia Chamber of 
Commerce manager Patricia Smith-Green. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jacqueline has already learned a lot from Ms. Smith-Green.  
They spend two hours weekly together under the auspices of a One to 
One mentoring program. ``It gives me more initiative to learn,'' 
said Jacqueline. ``It helps me realize the kind of things that are 
out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year, One to One is trying to place 600 girls with  
employers on Thursday, compared with 400 girls last year. And while 
more companies take girls each year, ``there are never enough 
workplaces,'' said Mary Strasser, executive director of One to One. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Flathead Indian Reservation in northwest Montana, Velda  
Shelby does whatever she can to get as many local girls as possible 
-- neighbors, grandaughters, nieces -- into the tribal government, 
the region's largest employer, on Daughters to Work day. The local 
high school dropout rate is 40 percent, and many parents don't 
work, she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Then she's blunt about what they're up against in future. ``I  
let `em know, I'm right there,'' says Ms. Shelby, an administrative 
assistant. ``My whole face and body is slammed up against this 
glass ceiling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But when faced with glass ceilings in a robust job market, many  
women can go elsewhere. That's one reason companies such as 
American Express are offering mentoring opportunities to talented 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``More and more, (mentoring) is becoming more formalized and  
more and more it's becoming a priority in terms of recruiting and 
retaining the best talent,'' said Beth Franzone, a spokeswoman for 
American Express, which has created a number of mentoring programs 
in recent years both for women and all employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Both household products maker Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. and  
accountants Deloitte &AMP; Touche found mentoring to be a key in 
creating pioneering programs to help move women into upper 
management. 
</P>
<P>
	``People tend to reach out to and mentor and coach people who  
are most like them,'' said Ellen Stafford-Sigg, associate national 
director of Deloitte &AMP; Touche's advancement program. ``We wanted to 
try to figure out an environment where mentoring and coaching would 
be fostered for all, but particularly for women.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharri Reese was eager to spend the day with Diana Montanez; Ms.  
Reese had visited her mother's office when young and knew how 
important mentors are. This year, Ms. Reese will take another girl 
around, and Miss Montanez will be making a speech about her 
experience to other girls. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important when somebody is caring enough about you to  
show what they do, and care about your future,'' said Ms. Reese. 
``I didn't really do much, but just me talking to her I guess was 
enough.''

<HEADLINE> Bruins Likely To Target Primeau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- It doesn't take long to size up which  
Carolina player can hurt you the most offensively in the Stanley 
Cup playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	With his 6-foot-5 reach and 220 pounds of muscle, Hurricanes  
center Keith Primeau is likely to be a prime target of the Boston 
Bruins when they visit Carolina in the first game of their 
best-of-7 series Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The job of Carolina coach Paul Maurice is the find a way to get  
Primeau some skating room. Or is it? 
</P>
<P>
	Maurice said he has been extremely happy with lines centered by  
Ron Francis and Jeff O'Neill the past few weeks, and may end up 
letting Primeau, who led the Hurricanes with 30 goals, be matched 
up against Boston's top checkers. 
</P>
<P>
	``That may not be something we want to avoid in the first  
round,'' said Maurice, who as the home coach has the final call as 
to which players are on the ice last. ``Regardless of whether we 
try to move him away from the other team's checking line he is 
going to face the other team's best defensemen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't go into this series saying, `You know what, if Keith  
Primeau doesn't have a great offensive series we can't win.' Our 
team is deeper than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Carolina captain said his lack of offensive production in  
past postseasons with the Detroit Red Wings won't affect his play 
this time around with Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Primeau, often a third-line center with the Red Wings as a  
youngster, has scored only six goals in 64 career playoff games 
entering the series with the Bruins -- not exactly numbers that will 
turn heads. 
</P>
<P>
	His one goal in 17 postseason games in '96 was one of several  
factors that led to a bitter departure from Detroit in a trade with 
the then-Hartford Whalers for Brendan Shanahan. 
</P>
<P>
	But three seasons later, the 27-year-old veteran is an all-star  
who led the Hurricanes to the Southeast Division title and the 
franchise's first playoff appearance since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	In the long run, the change of scenery may have done Primeau  
some good. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't get the sense from him that he has to erase any ghosts  
and I certainly don't expect him to,'' Maurice said. ``We would all 
be disappointed if he tries because you just can't do that. He has 
reached a different level right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Primeau laughed when asked about erasing any ghosts from the  
past. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's ludicrous,'' Primeau said when asked about playoff  
demons. ``We had solid depth the whole time I was (in Detroit) so I 
didn't need to contribute as a front-runner. With this hockey club, 
my role has changed and I need to contribute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Primeau, who had no goals and two assists against Boston this  
season in five games, said he's not worried about putting up points 
as long as the Hurricanes advance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, I need to contribute and our line needs to  
contribute, but I see or forecast not a lot of goals being scored 
in this series,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we have to do everything to get Keith out in the  
open,'' Maurice added about the potential for a tight-checking 
series. ``The fact of the matter is that Keith generates most of 
his goals while he is being checked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Primeau missed the final three regular-season games after flying  
to Toronto get a nagging back problem checked out. He said he's 
fine and close to 100 percent for Thursday night's opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``I injured my lower back four or five weeks ago and I was  
playing through it, just hoping it would kind of leave on it's own, 
but it didn't. I felt it was best to get it taken care of, and more 
than anything, get a little rest.''

<HEADLINE> Defense Rests in Trade Secrets Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio (AP) -- A judge today dismissed several charges  
against two Taiwanese executives accused of stealing trade secrets 
from Avery Dennison Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Both defendants still are accused of economic espionage,  
conspiracy to commit economic espionage, money laundering and mail 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys on Wednesday rested their case without calling  
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Pin Yen Yang, president of Four Pillars Enterprise Co. Ltd., and  
his daughter, Hwei Chen ``Sally'' Yang, are charged with paying off 
an Ohio-based Avery Dennison researcher from 1989 to 1997 for 
information on the adhesive maker's label technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors showed jurors a secretly made videotape in which the  
Yangs read documents passed to them by researcher Ten Hong 
``Victor'' Lee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department says the case is the first to reach trial  
under the 1996 Economic Espionage Act, which bans the theft of 
trade secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the Yangs was being tried on 21 counts, though U.S.  
District Judge Peter Economus has dismissed 17 of them. 
</P>
<P>
	The money laundering charge carries the longest possible prison  
sentence -- 20 years. The Yangs could face 10 years in prison if 
convicted of economic espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Four Pillars declined comment on the case's  
latest developments. Prosecutors did not return a phone call 
requesting comment.

<HEADLINE> Shoes Talk for Indians' Ramirez </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Manny Ramirez has let his bat do the talking  
for him all season. Now he's added a pair of spokesmen -- his shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second straight day, Ramirez wore white shoes during  
pregame batting practice that had cryptic messages written on the 
heels. It's unclear if Ramirez wrote the messages himself or if 
he's using a ghost writer. 
</P>
<P>
	But whatever Ramirez is up to, the Cleveland Indians right  
fielder isn't saying what it is. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the back of Ramirez's right shoe said: ``There will  
be hell to pay! And the left one said: ``Justice will be served!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the Indians played the Oakland Athletics Wednesday night,  
Ramirez's shoes bore the words: ``Free me!'' on the right, and 
``Live and let die!'' on the left. 
</P>
<P>
	The timing of Ramirez's footwear frolics is interesting given  
his uncertain future with the Indians beyond next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez, leading the majors with 22 RBIs, will make $4 million  
this season and has a club option for 2000. If he comes close to 
putting up the numbers he did on 1998 -- 45 homers, 145 RBIs -- by 
the time his contract expires, Ramirez could command a contract in 
the $15 million per season range. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez and his agent, Eric Goldschmidt, reportedly turned down  
a seven-year, $56 million contract extension from the Indians this 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Indians general manager John Hart said during spring training  
that he might ``revisit'' negotiations with Goldschmidt this 
season, but it doesn't appear to be high on his priority list. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got Manny for two years and at the appropriate time  
we'll do what we have to do,'' Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez hasn't talked to Cleveland reporters since early in  
training camp. It's not that he has been rude, he just doesn't seem 
interested in talking. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldschmidt told the Plain Dealer he never told Ramirez to shun  
the media because of the contract situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never told Manny not to talk,'' Goldschmidt said. ``I've  
never seen him do an interview. I always thought the Indians kept 
him away from that.''

<HEADLINE> More Perks for Tech Secretaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- They don't have to wear pantyhose, take  
dictation or get paid measly sums while their company soars. 
</P>
<P>
	The men and women -- they're still mostly women -- being honored  
this Secretaries Week in the Silicon Valley are every bit as non 
traditional as the technological revolution surrounding them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know his passwords, I open his e-mails when he wants me to,  
and if he wanted coffee, he would probably go get it himself,'' 
said Karen Hallstein, executive administrator to Sun Microsystems 
Inc. CEO Scott McNealy. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun, a $10 billion maker of business computer systems, is one of  
thousands of companies -- Hewlett-Packard Co., Intel Corp. and Apple 
Inc. among them -- that make Silicon Valley the center of the 
international high tech economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind the high-profile leaders of these massive companies are  
secretaries who -- unlike their more traditional counterparts 
elsewhere in the country -- are making crucial business decisions 
every day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a lot of influence here,'' said Gwen Caldwell,  
executive assistant to Nortel Networks president Dave House in 
Santa Clara, Calif. ``This image of dressing in a suit, going into 
some tall building and answering the phones and doing the calendar 
all day, well, frankly, I'd be really bored if that's what I had to 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Caldwell and her colleagues draft letters, research  
companies, brief executives and organize deals. 
</P>
<P>
	As they help these multibillion dollar companies grow, the  
Silicon Valley secretaries aren't missing out on the profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The average secretary in the United States makes between $25,000  
and $35,000 a year. In the Silicon Valley, salaries are three times 
that amount, averaging between $60,000 and $100,000, said Michelle 
Burke, president of Executive Counterparts, an executive and 
administrative staff training agency in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, said Burke, most Silicon Valley secretaries are  
getting stock options, which means they will profit if their 
company succeeds. 
</P>
<P>
	But Burke said the high-tech secretaries don't just get to sit  
around filing their nails. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pressure is far greater for executive assistants in the  
Silicon Valley,'' she said. ``They work especially long hours, 
60-70 hours a week, and the stress level is much higher. They're 
coordinating with people all over the world at nanoseconds. It 
takes somebody who is going to be committed beyond the norm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hallstein, who makes $65,000 a year plus stock options, said  
``there's not a whole heck of a lot that I wouldn't do for Scott if 
he asked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, the role of secretaries has shifted in recent years.  
According to an International Association of Administrative 
Professionals survey, one-third of secretaries supervise others, 45 
percent train others, especially on computer skills, and 78 percent 
recommend or make purchasing decisions for the office. 
</P>
<P>
	Job titles are changing as well.  
</P>
<P>
	Just 18 percent of IAAP members are called secretaries these  
days. The rest are called administrative assistants, coordinators, 
specialists, executive secretaries or executive assistants. 
</P>
<P>
	``The word secretary is passe, it's old world. In the Silicon  
Valley, we're fighting very hard to change that, because we're 
really not just typing and filing and answering the phone. We're 
empowered. We're making decisions,'' said Debbie Gross, who has 
worked with Cisco Systems president John Chambers in San Jose for 8 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Gross isn't one of the more than 50 vice presidents at Cisco  
Inc., the world's biggest maker of equipment linking computers in 
networks. But she may be one of the most powerful people in the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I asked John to go get me a sandwich, he'd do it,'' she  
said. ``We're very respectful of each other. I'm his confidante.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gross works 12-hour days, keeping Chamber's complex  
international schedule, briefing him for meetings, reading his 
e-mail and keeping tabs on Cisco's 18,000 staffers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my role to feed back to John the temperature of the  
organization,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Relationships between corporate leaders and their secretaries in  
the Silicon Valley are very casual, open and trusting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I call him Hank,'' said Linda McFarland, executive assistant  
to San Jose-based Concentric Network Corp. president Henry 
Nothhaft. ``I'm a communications hub for this company. He respects 
me for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McFarland, who can type 150 words a minute, uses a laptop  
computer, a Palm Pilot handheld computer, two cellular telephones 
and a pager along with her desktop office system to do her job and 
organize her life. A mother of four teens, she has worked as a 
secretary for 20 years, from health care to legal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like high-tech best because it's in lightening speed,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	McFarland said she also likes the stock options.  
</P>
<P>
	``Getting options makes me more engaged in the company, more  
excited about what I'm doing,'' she said. ``I'm not really a 
secretary. I'm more or less an owner.''

<HEADLINE> Northrop Reports $104 Million Gain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Northrop Grumman Corp. earned $104 million  
during the first quarter as increased sales by its Logicon 
information technology subsidiary offset declines in airplane 
production, the company announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The gain, equal to $1.50 per share, compares to a loss of $12  
million, or 18 cents per share in the first quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Northrop's latest results do not include a $16 million after-tax  
charge resulting from the adoption of a new accounting standard. 
With the charge taken into account, the maker of the B-2 bomber and 
military radar systems earned $88 million, or $1.26 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 results reflect a $180 million charge for the cost of  
terminating its proposed merger with aerospace rival Lockheed 
Martin. The union with Lockheed was scrapped after the Pentagon and 
Justice Department raised antitrust concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the latest quarter were $2.1 billion, up slightly from  
$2 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Northrop Grumman stock rose 18 3/4 cents to close at $64.81 1/4 a  
share on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our first quarter results were consistent with our  
expectations,'' said Kent Kresa, Northrup Grumman's chairman, 
president and chief executive officer. ``Logicon continues to 
generate impressive sales growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for Logicon, which among other things helps the Pentagon  
evaluate military contracts, were $359 million, up from $235 
million during the first quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Airplane production was affected by a drop in B-2 sales and a  
decline in sales to Boeing Co.'s commercial airplane division.

<HEADLINE> Global Warming Might Spur El Nino </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Conditions like El Nino might settle in almost permanently if  
global warming gets bad enough, making climate disruptions such as 
droughts or excessive winter rain essentially the norm, a computer 
study suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	That might happen around the year 2050 if nothing is done to  
control emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases, 
said researcher Mojib Latif of the Max Planck Institute for 
Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	El Nino is a natural phenomenon that involves a surface warming  
of the eastern and central Pacific Ocean around the equator. It 
happens every three to four years on average. It can disrupt 
climate around the world, producing extra rain in the southeastern 
United States and in Peru during the winter, while causing drought 
in the western Pacific, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	The computer simulation suggests that unrestrained global  
warming could set up the same kind of pattern in ocean surface 
temperatures, but as a more or less constant condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Latif and colleagues report their findings in Thursday's issue  
of the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Essentially, the study suggests that the Pacific would warm more  
in the east than the west. That's because the western part is 
already so warm that with further heating it would spawn clouds 
that provide cooling shade, Latif said. 
</P>
<P>
	The El-Nino-like temperature pattern might be broken every five  
years or so by a strong cooling like the periodic phenomenon called 
La Nina, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	But Latif said scientists have ``a long way to go'' before they  
can be sure the study's conclusions are correct. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerald Meehl of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in  
Boulder, Colo., agreed it will take more study to understand how 
global warming might affect El Nino. Studies have disagreed on 
whether the warming would produce the El-Nino-like Pacific surface 
temperatures, he said.

<HEADLINE> Man Guilty of Killing Retired Gen. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROSEBURG, Ore. (AP) -- Marion Carl survived three wars, and in  
World War II he collected 18 air victories and twice won the Navy 
Cross. 
</P>
<P>
	He outmaneuvered enemy pilots during war, but Carl, 82, couldn't  
protect himself from a teen-age drifter. He died trying to shield 
his wife from the man who had broken into their southern Oregon 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, as she sat in court Wednesday behind the 19-year-old  
defendant, Carl's widow could only feel pity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I looked at him and thought, `What a waste of a human  
being,''' Edna Carl said. ``He chose the wrong road and now he has 
got to pay for it, and he is only 19 years of age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jesse Fanus was convicted of aggravated murder, for which he  
could get the death penalty, and other charges in the June 28 
killing of Carl, a retired major general and the Marine Corps' 
first flying ace. 
</P>
<P>
	The sentencing phase of the trial begins Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Carl sat behind Fanus during closing statements, but was  
not in court for the verdict. She heard that news later from a 
neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't feel relieved until it's all over with,'' Mrs. Carl  
said. ``I have a gut feeling he will never get the death sentence, 
but I would like to see him put away because he is really a danger 
to society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She had been sitting in her living room the night of June 28,  
reading the newspaper and watching television after her husband had 
gone to bed. 
</P>
<P>
	The door burst open and a young man, accompanied by a German  
shepherd dog and brandishing a sawed-off shotgun, screamed at her 
for cash and her car keys. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearing the commotion, Marion Carl came out of the bedroom. When  
he advanced on Fanus, the gunman shot him in the head. Mrs. Carl 
was grazed in the head by a bullet. 
</P>
<P>
	An Oregon farm boy, Marion Carl was awarded the Navy Cross for  
the battles of Guadalcanal and Midway. After World War II, he 
headed the Navy test flight program, briefly holding the air speed 
record; flew U-2 spy planes over China; and commanded a helicopter 
squadron in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Carl, who still lives in their house 60 miles south of  
Eugene overlooking the North Umpqua River, said she sometimes wakes 
up in the middle of the night thinking it was all a dream. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then I looked over the bed and my husband wasn't there and I  
would say, `That was no dream.''

<HEADLINE> SEC Sues Alleged Internet Scammer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators are suing Gary Dale Hoke,  
who is already facing criminal charges for allegedly posting a 
fabricated news story on the Internet, boosting the stock of his 
employer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Securities and Exchange Commission announced Wednesday a  
civil suit against Hoke in federal court in Los Angeles, charging 
stock manipulation and seeking an unspecified fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoke, a 25-year-old employee of PairGain Technologies, was  
arrested at his home in Raleigh, N.C., last Thursday after FBI 
agents tracked him down despite an alleged attempt to conceal his 
identity with pseudonyms and fake e-mail addresses. He was traced 
through Internet protocol addresses that uniquely identify any 
computer on the Internet, according to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	The April 7 hoax, which featured a copy of a Web page from  
Bloomberg News Service and a phony story about a corporate 
takeover, sparked a 31 percent jump in the stock price of PairGain, 
a Tustin, Calif.-based maker of telecommunications equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The bogus news report said PairGain would be acquired by ECI  
Telecom, an Israeli company, for $1.35 billion, or about twice its 
market value at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the day, after PairGain, Bloomberg and ECI issued press  
releases denying the statements in the phony news story, PairGain's 
stock dropped precipitously, the SEC noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoke knew or should have known ``that the posting of the false  
information concerning the acquisition of PairGain by ECI Telecom 
would result in an increase in both the price and the volume of 
trading in PairGain securities,'' the SEC said in its complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoke's attorney, Sam Currin, didn't immediately return a  
telephone call seeking comment on the SEC's action. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Sauer, assistant director of enforcement at the SEC,  
said the action shows that the agency ``has the capability to jump 
on people like this (who) use the Internet to manipulate the price 
of a stock. 
</P>
<P>
	``We intend to go after this kind of stuff vigorously,'' Sauer  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the criminal suit, Hoke faces up to 10 years in federal  
prison and a $1 million fine if convicted in what is believed to be 
the first stock manipulation scheme using a fraudulent news service 
Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors have described Hoke as a mid-level engineer  
in electronics development at PairGain. He was arraigned in North 
Carolina and released on $50,000 bond with orders to report to a 
federal court in Los Angeles at an unspecified date. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said there was no allegation that any executives at  
PairGain were involved in the hoax and that the company was 
cooperating in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles McBrayer, PairGain's senior vice president and chief  
financial officer, has said the company was disappointed and upset 
that the evidence appeared to point to one of its employees. 
</P>
<P>
	McBrayer said that Hoke, an employee since January 1997,  
allegedly accessed the Internet through a computer at PairGain's 
facility in Raleigh. PairGain has about 70 workers there who make 
equipment that enables telephone companies to carry multiple calls 
over existing copper wiring. 
</P>
<P>
	The criminal charges filed last week against Hoke alleged that  
investors who paid the inflated price for PairGain stock were 
defrauded. According to the charges, one victim of the hoax was an 
investor in Santa Ana, Calif., who bought 1,500 shares of PairGain 
after learning of the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors did not specifically allege that Hoke traded in  
PairGain stock on April 7, but an affidavit said Hoke has a history 
of using online trading companies to buy and sell securities, and 
that he traded PairGain stock as recently as January. 
</P>
<P>
	Bloomberg LP, parent company of the news service, recently filed  
a related lawsuit in federal court in New York City, seeking 
unspecified damages.

<HEADLINE> Gingrich Raises Money for Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As House speaker, Newt Gingrich was a  
prodigious fund-raiser for GOP candidates around the country as 
well as for himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Four months after leaving office, he has signed his first  
fund-raising letter on behalf of a candidate, former Rep. Mike 
Parker, running in a contested primary in Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	``We became friends and allies because I admired the way he  
always stood up for his conservative, pro-family beliefs,'' 
Gingrich wrote. ``Day in and day-out in Washington, I watched Mike 
take on the liberals on issue after issue,'' Gingrich added in the 
appeal, a copy of which was mailed to a Democratic senator at his 
congressional office. 
</P>
<P>
	Parker retired from Congress late year and is one of three  
Republicans vying for the nomination to replace GOP Gov. Kirk 
Fordyce, who is barred by state law from seeking a third term. 
</P>
<P>
	Parker, a former Democrat, switched to the GOP after Republicans  
won control of the House in 1995. He was allied closely with 
Gingrich, and helped him weather an internal coup in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``Republican activists consider him the father of the  
revolution,'' Parker said in a telephone interview. ``He's still 
very popular around the country, especially in Mississippi.'' 
Gingrich also campaigned personally for Parker earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	--------	 

</P>
<P>
	To judge by their recent fund-raising appeal, House Republicans  
are in tough shape financially with the next elections 19 months 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now we are faced with an emergency situation,'' the GOP  
campaign committee headlined a recent fund-raising appeal to some 
of its donors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last month we fell $267,500 short of the money needed to fund  
our incumbent support programs,'' said the appeal, which was sent 
out over the signature of Donna Anderson, the campaign committee's 
treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Add this $267,500 to the $538,700 we need to get through April  
and you'll understand why I'm so upset ... either we raise $806,200 
by April 30th, or we immediately begin slashing our candidate 
recruitment efforts, delaying our candidate training schools and 
curtailing our staff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the committee, spokeswoman Jill Schroeder said: ``We have  
ongoing efforts to raise money for the committee. If you don't 
raise enough money you have to cut expenses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The committee's current leadership ``inherited a hard money debt  
of over $3 million,'' she added. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are not expected to disclose their fundraising  
totals until June 30, although officials said donors have responded 
to recent fund-raising solicitations. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats trumpeted their first quarter fund-raising last week,  
saying they had raised $6.8 million in the first three months of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
	--------	 

</P>
<P>
	Congressional Republicans will travel to the nation's heartland  
next week to tout their proposals for locking up Social Security 
surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi, Sen. John  
Ashcroft of Missouri and Rep. Jim Talent of Missouri are scheduled 
to attend a ``town hall'' meeting in St. Louis on Monday evening. 
The event coincides with Lott's decision to bring Social Security 
``lockbox'' legislation to the Senate floor, where it is has drawn 
opposition from the White House and Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are eager to change the polls that show that voters  
trust Democrats more than the GOP to deal with Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	The House GOP leadership had planned a two-day tour to several  
cities earlier this month to stress their commitment to setting 
aside the surplus. Those plans were scrubbed, a decision officials 
said at the time was due to the ongoing air war over Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Mirage Casino Trying To Buy Caesars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Just months after opening the world's most  
expensive hotel-casino next to Caesars Palace, Mirage Resorts Inc. 
is now trying to buy the neighboring Las Vegas Strip resort and 
other Caesars properties, a source has confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Mirage joined the bidding for the resorts, which were put on the  
auction block earlier this month by Starwood Hotels and Resorts 
Worldwide Inc., after talks with Park Place Entertainment hit a 
snag over price, a person close to the negotiations said. 
</P>
<P>
	The source, who demanded anonymity, said a deal to sell the  
resorts could be finalized within a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Starwood Chairman Barry S. Sternlicht is believed to be seeking  
more than $3 billion for the flagship Caesars Palace hotel-casino 
along with the Caesars resorts in Atlantic City, N.J., and Lake 
Tahoe, Nev., and the Desert Inn hotel-casino in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Published reports earlier said that Park Place, which owns the  
Hilton, Bally's and Grand casino chains, had been the leading 
contender to acquire the Caesars properties. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Mirage, which opened the $1.6 billion Bellagio  
hotel-casino next to Caesars Palace in October, did not return 
phone calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Starwood officials declined comment, while Park Place had said  
earlier it would not comment on bidding speculation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever since acquiring the Caesars properties as part of  
Starwood's $14.6 billion purchase of ITT Corp. in 1998, Sternlicht 
has said he was not familiar with the gambling business and would 
probably sell the resorts eventually. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the Bellagio, Mirage operates the Mirage, Golden  
Nugget and Treasure Island casinos in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	In a development apparently related to the impending sale of the  
casino properties, Starwood announced Thursday the resignation of 
Richard D. Nanula, president and chief operating officer of the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Sternlicht said in a statement that Nanula, who oversaw the  
hotel and gambling group, would seek other opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Richard and I have been friends for over 10 years,''  
Sternlicht said. ``We shared a strategic vision for the company and 
believe that it is well on its way to fulfillment. As our business 
has evolved and the integration transition has progressed, we came 
to the mutual decision that our interests were best served by 
pursuing our careers separately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sternlicht said there are no immediate plans to seek a  
replacement for Nanula. 
</P>
<P>
	Starwood has more than 700 hotels in 72 countries through its  
St. Regis, Westin, Sheraton, Four Points, and Caesars brands.

<HEADLINE> Shooting Reopens Old Wounds for Some </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	When students at Thurston High School in Springfield, Ore.,  
heard the news of the Colorado shooting over their intercom, 
several reflexively bolted for the door. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people started going toward the door thinking it was  
happening here,'' said Thurston student Willie Kumle. ``A girl that 
sits next to me started crying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still reeling from their own school rampage 11 months earlier,  
several students mistakenly thought their own nightmare was 
happening again. 
</P>
<P>
	The Littleton, Colo., shooting was a violent reminder to this  
small town of last May's tragedy, when student Kip Kinkel allegedly 
walked into the school's cafeteria and opened fire, killing two 
students and wounding more than 20 others. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's creepy really,'' said James Ready, 17, a junior at  
Thurston. ``I honestly thought ours would be the last one, that 
people would have grown up by now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Arkansas, the whole scene was painfully familiar to Mitchell  
Wright -- the stretch of highway, the news on the car radio, the 
pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright was driving on nearly the same patch of road when he  
heard the news as he was driving March 24, 1998 -- the day his wife, 
Shannon, was gunned down along with four students at a Jonesboro, 
Ark., middle school. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're kind of numb at first -- you kind of go through this  
reality check that this did happen,'' he said. ``You just instantly 
think back to what happened in your own life last year and you feel 
for the families and what they're about to go through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Terror, despair, frustration -- the growing group of victims from  
a spate of recent school shootings said Tuesday that the Littleton 
shootings just ripped open wounds that can't get a chance to close. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's Dec. 1, 1997, all over again. How many more times does  
this have to happen?'' said Sabrina Steger, who was already crying 
when she answered her phone Tuesday. ``It doesn't get any easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steger's daughter, Kayce, was 15 when she was shot dead in  
December 1997 by another student who opened fire on a group of 
students praying in the hallway of their Kentucky school. 
</P>
<P>
	Sobbing to a reporter, the Paducah, Ky., woman said she relives  
the terrifying scene of her daughter's death every time a new 
shooting happens at another school. Tuesday's attack was at least 
the eighth in the last 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	``My daughter said a week ago, 'I wonder when it's going to  
happen again,''' said James Strand, who owns the dance hall where 
Andrew Wurst, 15, gunned down middle school teacher John Gillette 
at a graduation dance in Edinboro, Pa., last April 24. 
</P>
<P>
	``She said, 'I think it's just a matter of when and where,'''  
Strand said. ``And she was right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strand, whose wife and four children were at the dance, chased  
Wurst down and held him until police came. The survivors of the 
Columbine High School shooting have hard days ahead, he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has taken any innocence. It has stripped it from me and it  
has stripped it from my wife and my children,'' he said. ``Now we 
watch everything we do and everywhere we go, and that's the biggest 
loss for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edinboro residents had been planning a prayer vigil Saturday to  
mark the painful anniversary of the Gillette shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been a very hard week for me. And this is not  
helping,'' Debbie Gillette, the teacher's widow, said of the 
Colorado shooting. ``It makes me sick.''

<HEADLINE> Goals at Premium for Sens, Sabres / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANATA, Ontario (AP) -- Judging from the regular season, goals  
are going to be at a premium when the Buffalo Sabres and Ottawa 
Senators meet tonight in Game 1 of their Eastern Conference 
quarterfinal. 
</P>
<P>
	All five games between the teams went into overtime this season,  
with the Senators winning 3-2 on Dec. 30 in Buffalo and the other 
four going unresolved. The 3-2 win was also the only time one team 
managed to score three goals. Only 15 goals were scored in total by 
both teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a battle,'' said Senators defenceman Wade  
Redden. ``But that's the price we have to pay to advance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the league's top two leaders in goals-against average in  
Ron Tugnutt and Dominik Hasek, the emphasis will be on defence and 
special teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've played a lot against Dominik Hasek,'' said Senators  
winger Shawn McEachern. ``We aren't expecting any high-scoring 
games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two clubs are meeting in the playoffs for the second time in  
three years, with Buffalo eliminating Ottawa from its first-ever 
modern-day playoff appearance two seasons ago courtesy of Derek 
Plante's Game 7 overtime goal against Tugnutt. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always been a great intensity against them,'' said  
Senators winger Daniel Alfredsson. ``We can't just focus on their 
goaltending. They have a good team in front of him as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alfredsson says there is a way to beat the Dominator.  
</P>
<P>
	``You have to make it tough for him to see the puck,'' said  
Alfredsson. ``We know we have to shoot a lot and be there for the 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing is you can't think he'll be there to stop  
everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek played all five games between the two teams during the  
regular season, surrendering eight goals, three in the final three 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's their best player,'' Alfredsson said. ``But he's not  
their only player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tugnutt, who led the NHL with a GAA of 1.79 this season, doesn't  
think his club should be too focused on Hasek. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to be concerned with the way, the style of hockey that  
they play,'' he said, adding that both teams play a tight, 
defensive style of hockey. ``It's not just Dominik Hasek we have to 
beat, although he is a major part of that team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senators were 3-2-5 in their final 10 regular season games,  
a slump that didn't concern coach Jacques Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're well prepared,'' Martin said. ``We're a team  
looking forward to starting the playoffs, we're anxious.''

<HEADLINE> ETrade To Offer Choice in Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Internet broker ETrade Group plans to  
offer Nasdaq trading customers the option of completing their 
orders through an Electronic Communications Network. 
</P>
<P>
	ECNs execute trades with no intermediary. Traditional ``market  
makers,'' which currently handle most trades, pay brokerages to 
send them orders. They often use their own inventory of stock to 
complete orders, pocketing the difference between what they paid to 
buy it and the investors' purchase price. 
</P>
<P>
	ETrade, based in Palo Alto, Calif., will begin offering  
customers a choice between the two methods in the fourth quarter, 
USA Today reported today. It will route orders to an ECN called 
Archipelago, of which ETrade owns 25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	ECNs account for a growing share of all Nasdaq trades. One  
upstart named Island has executed 16 percent of all Yahoo trades 
and 19 percent of Amazon.com trades this year, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The networks say they can sometimes get a better price for  
investors by cutting out the intermediary firm and letting buyers 
and sellers directly transact. 
</P>
<P>
	Some brokerages, such as CyBerCorp and Datek, are aggressively  
marketing their ECN use. But neither lets customers choose where to 
complete their transactions.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Going Without Pacific Carrier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is bringing in aircraft carriers  
and planes from around the globe to provide firepower for NATO 
airstrikes in Yugoslavia, taxing a military stretched thin by 
post-Cold War cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of that conflict and continuing tensions with Iraq,  
no aircraft carrier will be plying the Pacific until the fall 
unless an emergency requires a quick call-up. Air Force planes have 
gone on alert to handle any trouble in the Pacific area. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are stretched thin and there are places we don't have  
forces,'' Navy Adm. Archie Clemins, commander-in-chief of the 
Pacific fleet, said today at a military readiness hearing of a 
Senate Armed Services Committee panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Clemins and Navy Adm. J.P. Reason, commander-in-chief of  
the Atlantic fleet, said they were deploying battle groups without 
all the needed sailors aboard because of personnel shortages. They 
also said there aren't enough spare parts for ships and aircraft, 
which could hurt future readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	Reason said he was also concerned about not quickly replacing  
the Tomahawk cruise missiles used in Yugoslavia. The Navy had about 
1,000 of the $1 million weapons before the conflict began. He 
wouldn't say how many have been used so far. 
</P>
<P>
	``All fleet units are still today fit to fight ... but I would  
be more comfortable with a few more arrows in my quiver,'' Reason 
told lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The admirals said it would be tough for the U.S. armed forces to  
handle more than one conflict at a time given the strains now 
showing. Said Reason: ``If we have some other flare-up in the 
world, then we're a little short.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The USS Kitty Hawk had been assigned to the Pacific on April 3  
but was ordered to the Persian Gulf to free up the USS Theodore 
Roosevelt to join NATO's Balkan campaign. The Roosevelt arrived 
April 5 in the Adriatic Sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the Pentagon is considering a second carrier for the allied  
forces to help meet a NATO request for 300 more American warplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	The USS Enterprise and its 75 aircraft, which reached the  
Mediterranean on Tuesday after a six-month Gulf deployment, could 
be sent to the Aegean Sea instead of home, U.S. defense officials 
said. More warplanes also could come from forces around Iraq and 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon also may base planes in Turkey and Hungary, both  
NATO members, which could eliminate the need for a second carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior defense official, describing the search for resources,  
said the U.S. military's flexibility is reduced since the Cold War, 
when the Navy had 600 ships, for example, compared with 324 today. 
The official spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, the Navy had 15 carriers, with one in reserve, which is  
just enough to keep one each in the three places the Pentagon would 
like to cover 365 days a year: the Persian Gulf, the Mediterranean 
and the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy has had just 12 carriers since 1994, however, which  
means gaps of weeks and sometimes months will occur when the 
Pacific, the Mediterranean or the Gulf goes without. 
</P>
<P>
	Maj. Gen. Charles Wald, a strategic planner for the Joint Chiefs  
of Staff, acknowledged that as NATO's air campaign continues, 
``Over time, it will take a little bit of a toll.'' But he said the 
shifting of carriers and aircraft demonstrates the flexibility of 
today's leaner military. 
</P>
<P>
	``We adjust our forces as necessary,'' Wald said. ``If an  
aircraft carrier moves, we can backfill that with aircraft, and 
vice versa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the U.S. military standoff with Iraq, which flared with  
four days of airstrikes in December, the Navy kept one or two 
aircraft carriers in the Gulf for 555 days in a row. That meant a 
gap in the Mediterranean and higher alert status for Air Force 
planes at Italy's Aviano air base, a major takeoff point for 
airstrikes now. 
</P>
<P>
	As Congress considers a $6.05 billion White House request to pay  
for NATO military and humanitarian activities in the Balkans, House 
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said the Kosovo crisis has shown 
that ``our troops are stretched too thin, and our defense 
capabilities are now grossly inadequate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leaving the Pacific unguarded by a carrier for long could send  
the wrong signal to North Korea, China or Indonesia, now 
experiencing violence ahead of elections, the first defense 
official said, because a visible U.S. military presence helps 
maintain stability. 
</P>
<P>
	If a crisis erupted in the Pacific, the Navy could deploy the  
USS Constellation within two to three weeks, defense officials 
said. The carrier's normal rotation would place it in the Pacific 
in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. military doctrine calls for the Pentagon to be prepared to  
fight two regional wars at the same time. Defense officials insist 
that remains possible, even with the U.S. armed forces trimmed to 
2.4 million active duty personnel and Reserves, compared with 3.8 
million in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	In times of conflict, presidents today rely more than they used  
to on the National Guard and Reserves. President Clinton is 
expected soon to call up as many as 33,000 of them, primarily to 
support the expected 300 additional U.S. warplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	Since NATO airstrikes began March 24, the Pentagon already has  
diverted planes from the Pacific command and from Iraq operations. 
Three hundred additional aircraft would bring the NATO force to 
about 1,000 planes, almost 800 of them American.

<HEADLINE> Sugar Futures Near 14-Year Low  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Sugar futures tumbled to their lowest level in nearly 14 years  
Wednesday on the Board of Trade of the City of New York amid 
expectations a global supply glut will linger for months. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, crude closed in on $18 a barrel, while orange  
juice futures rose to a two-month high. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar fell sharply on news the European Union agreed to increase  
its subsidies for the export of 91,750 metric tons of sugar, a move 
that is likely to add to the tons already flooding the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The news comes as Brazil, one of the world's largest single  
suppliers, gets ready to harvest yet another bumper crop. That 
country is expected to process 19 million metric tons beginning in 
May, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar prices have tumbled nearly 25 percent in less than a year  
after many producers had bumper harvests and demand from some of 
the world's top users fell off sharply amid economic problems in 
Russia and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Raw sugar for July delivery settled down 0.23 cent at 4.52 cents  
a pound, recovering slightly from a low earlier in the session of 
4.48 cents a pound, the lowest since August 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil futures rose sharply on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange after Venezuela sharply reduced shipments to the United 
States and Europe following a pipeline explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement late Tuesday reinforced sentiment that American  
supplies could become extremely tight going into the peak driving 
season that typically begins around Memorial Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Venezuela's state oil company said the explosion would reduce  
oil output by 278,000 barrels a day for at least 15 days. That 
comes on top of earlier announcements that deliveries would be 
trimmed because of that country's agreement to cut output by 
125,000 barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors also bid prices higher after weekly inventory figures  
showed larger-than-expected declines in stockpiles -- an indication 
that some of the world's top producers may be adhering to promised 
cuts that began April 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Petroleum Institute reported crude oil inventories  
fell 2.06 million barrels to 340.6 million barrels last week, a 
decline far sharper than expectations of a 1 million barrel 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil for June delivery rose 44 cents, or 2.5 percent, to  
$17.92 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest 
closing price since Dec. 26, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Orange juice futures rose sharply on the New York Board of Trade  
amid fears a dry spell in Florida, the nation's largest orange 
grower, will damage crops. 
</P>
<P>
	While orange juice supplies are ample as a result of a bumper  
crop last year, fires across that state threaten to sharply reduce 
this year's crop. The U.S. Agriculture Department already is 
predicting the fall harvest will be 22 percent below last year's, 
at 190 million boxes weighing 90 pounds each. 
</P>
<P>
	May frozen, concentrated orange juice rose 2.9 cents, or 3.4  
percent, to 88.75 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Congo Rebels Say They Will Fight On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- Fighting will continue despite an  
agreement between Congo's government and the Ugandan allies of 
rebels battling to oust Congolese President Laurent Kabila, the 
rebels said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels and their main backer, Rwanda, rejected the agreement  
brokered without their participation by Libyan leader Moammar 
Gadhafi. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will not have an immediate effect on the ground. We will  
continue fighting,'' rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, which was obtained by The Associated Press, calls  
for an immediate cessation of hostilities to pave the way for 
dialogue; deployment of neutral African peacekeeping forces; and 
the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Congo upon the signing of 
a peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement also calls for the signatories to condemn and  
punish acts of violence and mass murder. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview from the rebel-held city of Kisangani,  
Congo's third-largest city, Wamba said the agreement provided a 
positive blueprint from which to work. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Kampala, Jean-Pierre Bemba, the leader of a  
Ugandan-backed rebel group, said he will continue fighting in 
northern Congo. 
</P>
<P>
	Kabila said Monday the agreement opened the way for peace but  
did not guarantee an end to war. Senior Ugandan officials said they 
had not signed the agreement on behalf of the rebels or their 
Rwandan allies, but dealt only with their own interests in Congo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ugandans also ruled out an immediate pullout from Congo  
until a comprehensive peace agreement is reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Rwanda and Uganda have often differed over the course of war in  
Congo and appear to be supporting different rebel leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Ugandan Information Minister Basoga Nsadhu said Wednesday he  
remained optimistic about the potential impact of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shall hold consultations with friends like Rwanda in what I  
call `fine tuning,' '' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rwanda and Uganda have provided troops and arms for the rebel  
coalition of ethnic Tutsis, disaffected Congolese soldiers and 
Congolese opposition politicians who have swept through the eastern 
half of Africa's third-largest nation since taking up arms in 
August. The rebels were closing in on the southern diamond and 
mineral centers of Mbuji-Mayi and Lubumbashi, Kabila's main source 
of revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Rwandan leaders say they are in Congo to fight at least 10,000  
former Hutu soldiers and militiamen responsible for the 1994 
genocide in Rwanda and who have allied themselves with the 
Congolese government. 
</P>
<P>
	Kabila is receiving military support from Zimbabwe, Angola,  
Namibia and Chad. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement was reached between Kabila; Ugandan President  
Yoweri Museveni; Chad's president, Idriss Deby; and Eritrea's 
Issais Afwerki. It was signed Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Can NAACP's Mfume Save Baltimore? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Politicians, business leaders and civic  
activists have signed full-page ads urging NAACP President Kweisi 
Mfume to run for mayor of Baltimore. The Legislature changed the 
law to allow him to get into the race. There's even talk of raising 
the mayor's salary to make the job more attactive to Mfume. 
</P>
<P>
	Mfume, though, has given no hint of his intentions.  
</P>
<P>
	Money isn't the issue, he said, though taking the job could cut  
his salary in half. The difficulty of the job doesn't discourage 
the former congressman either, he said. Mfume said he will simply 
decide when the time is right. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't need to be enticed to run for mayor of this city,''  
Mfume said Tuesday in a speech at his alma mater, Baltimore City 
Community College. ``If I decide to get in this race for mayor, it 
won't be because some bigshot called me and told me this is what I 
should do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first time in 28 years that an incumbent will not be  
running for mayor of Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Kurt Schmoke has announced he will not seek re-election  
after 12 years of struggling to reverse the city's declining health 
and safety. The idiosyncratic William Donald Schaefer held the post 
for more than 15 years before becoming governor. 
</P>
<P>
	The deadline is July 6 to file for the September primary  
election -- the real race to win in this predominantly Democratic 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	But will Mfume, a 50-year-old Baltimore native whose name  
translates as ``Conquering Son of Kings,'' be on the ballot? 
</P>
<P>
	Both Schaefer, an Mfume supporter, and Schmoke, who has not  
endorsed anyone, have warned that Mfume must make a decision soon 
or risk being labeled indecisive by opponents. Those opponents are 
already criticizing the draft Mfume movement for holding up the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know there are people who are sitting on the sidelines, not  
giving anyone any money,'' said Kelley Ray, a spokeswoman for 
mayoral candidate Carl Stokes, a former City Council and school 
board member. 
</P>
<P>
	The job could prove harder than the campaign.  
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore has some of the highest homicide and syphilis rates in  
the nation, both symptoms of the drug trade. The state recently 
forced a reorganization of the school board because of poor student 
performance. As conditions have deteriorated, about one in eight 
residents has moved out since 1990, leaving a population of 
646,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being mayor is a tough job,'' said Larry Thomas, executive  
director of the school of public affairs at University of 
Baltimore. ``The problems aren't going to go away overnight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mfume is seen by his supporters as a savior because of the  
success he enjoyed at other levels of government. As a nine-year 
representative, he became head of the Congressional Black Caucus 
and gained a reputation for eloquence and charisma. 
</P>
<P>
	Mfume quit Congress in 1996 to take over the National  
Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The civil rights 
group had a $4 million deficit when he took over. It now has a 
budget surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing. They really want him,'' said Shawon Reed, a  
28-year-old single mother carrying a dogeared copy of Mfume's 
autobiography for him to sign after Tuesday's speech. ``I think he 
would really fight for the rights of the people of this city. He's 
always been a fighter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To open the door for Mfume, state lawmakers changed the  
residency requirement for Baltimore mayor from one year to six 
months. Mfume, who lived in suburban Catonsville, bought a 
condominium in Baltimore's revitalized Inner Harbor section last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Salary has been another issue. Mfume earns $220,000 a year at  
the NAACP and as much as $15,000 per speech. Some officials have 
suggested increasing the mayor's salary from $95,000 to $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
	To thwart the 58 percent raise, City Council President Lawrence  
Bell, who is Mfume's cousin and an undeclared candidate for mayor, 
introduced a bill Monday to increase the mayor's salary by 10 
percent. Bell has also talked about trying to change the residency 
requirement back to one year. 
</P>
<P>
	Mfume insisted money has never been an issue for him: ``The  
survival of this city is the issue.''

<HEADLINE> Giants 4, Marlins 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Armando Rios, playing in place of the  
injured Barry Bonds, homered and scored twice to lead the Giants to 
a 4-0 victory over the Florida Marlins on Wednesday and help Joe 
Nathan win his major league debut. 
</P>
<P>
	Rios hit his first homer of the season down the right-field line  
in the first and singled in the fourth to start a three-run inning 
that included an RBI double by Stan Javier and a two-run double by 
Ramon Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
	Javier's double was a routine fly ball that a ferocious wind  
turned into an adventure for left fielder Preston Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	Rios, who batted third in place of Bonds, also threw out a  
runner at the plate from right field in the seventh inning to 
preserve the shutout. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds is expected to miss at least 10 weeks following elbow  
surgery Tuesday. He said before the game his cast will be removed 
Friday and he'll immediately begin rehabilitation, in hopes of 
returning sooner. 
</P>
<P>
	Nathan (1-0), a converted shortstop who had never played above  
the Double-A level before Wednesday, pitched seven shutout innings. 
He allowed four hits and struck out four with pitches as fast as 97 
mph. 
</P>
<P>
	John Johnstone, who has not allowed a run in six innings this  
season, pitched the eighth for the Giants and Robb Nen pitched a 
perfect ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	Knuckleballer Dennis Springer (0-3) allowed four runs on five  
hits in four innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Derrek Lee had two of Florida's four hits off Nathan and went  
5-for-11 in the three-game series. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Nathan took the rotation spot of the injured Mark Gardner, 
who is on the disabled list with pain in his right shoulder. ... 
Martinez started at third in place of Charlie Hayes, who is serving 
a four-game suspension for starting a brawl with the Arizona 
Diamondbacks. ... The Marlins are 2-7 on the road this season. ... 
The Giants are 10-1 when they score four or more runs.

<HEADLINE> 25 May Be Dead in School Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Two teen-agers in black trench coats  
laughed and hooted as they opened fire on classmates in their 
suburban Denver high school, killing 25 people in the deadliest 
school rampage on record. 
</P>
<P>
	They marched into the library of Columbine High School on  
Tuesday with guns and pipe bombs, demanding that ``all jocks stand 
up. We're going to kill every one of you,'' said student Aaron 
Cohn. 
</P>
<P>
	A gunman looked under a desk in the library and said  
``Peek-a-boo,'' then fired, Cohn said. Anyone who cried or moaned 
was shot again. One girl begged for her life, but a gunshot ended 
her cries. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies lay crumpled in the schoolhouse where they were shot;  
officers delayed removing the corpses until today because of 
possible booby traps. 
</P>
<P>
	Bombs were found in and around the school, including in two cars  
in the school parking lot. More than 11 hours after the shootings, 
a bomb on a timer blew up, but no one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, frantic parents awaited word of their children into  
the night, watching as busloads of tearful students were reunited 
with their families. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 23 people were hospitalized, most of them with gunshot  
wounds. One girl suffered nine shrapnel wounds. At least nine 
victims were in critical or serious condition; one was in guarded 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The dead included students and at least one faculty member, said  
Superintendent Jane Hammond. 
</P>
<P>
	Students and Denver media identified the gunmen as Eric Harris  
and Dylan Klebold. The two exchange shots with police and were 
later found dead in the library with self-inflicted gunshot wounds 
and bombs around their bodies, said sheriff's spokesman Steve 
Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears to be a suicide mission,'' said Sheriff John Stone.  
</P>
<P>
	While the motive was unclear, several students said Harris and  
Klebold were members of a group calling itself the ``Trenchcoat 
Mafia,'' outcasts who bragged about guns and bombs and hated blacks 
and Hispanics, as well as athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Police who searched Harris' home said they found bomb-making  
material. Students said the group was fascinated with World War II 
and the Nazis and noted that Tuesday was Adolf Hitler's birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair, wearing fatigues and ankle-length black coats, opened  
fire in the parking lot around 11:30 a.m. before entering the 
school cafeteria. Bullets ricocheted off lockers as students raced 
toward the exits. 
</P>
<P>
	Student Nick Foss saw one of the gunmen pull a sawed-off shotgun  
from under his coat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Finally I started figuring out these guys shot to kill for no  
reason,'' Foss said. The gunman ``didn't say anything. When he 
looked at me, the guy's eyes were just dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The killers fired as they walked into the cafeteria and  
continued shooting as they moved upstairs into the library. Cohn 
said he heard one girl begging for her life and then a bang. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were laughing after they shot. It was like they were  
having the time of their life,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of students hid in classrooms before escaping with the  
help of police in an armored car. Others were trapped for hours 
while SWAT teams searched for the gunmen and their bombs. Some had 
called their parents on cellular phones from inside the building to 
whisper they were OK. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of police officers from throughout the Denver area  
surrounded the school, which has 1,800 students. As TV images of 
the scene were broadcast nationwide, helicopter ambulances used a 
sports field as a landing pad, and officers in helmets and 
camouflage gear took cover behind squad cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Students who fled the building wept and held their hands above  
their heads while police frisked them. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, President Clinton said: ``Perhaps now America  
will wake up to the dimensions of this challenge, if it could 
happen in a place like Littleton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Littleton is a suburb of 35,000 southwest of Denver, where  
farmland is rapidly disappearing beneath suburban sprawl and soccer 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
	Many parents gathered at a nearby elementary school and answered  
questions from investigators, who were trying to identify some of 
the victims based only on what they were wearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauri Senti waited 3 1/2 hours before she found her 14-year-old  
daughter, Ashley Steele, safe. Senti stayed at Leawood Elementary 
until late Tuesday to comfort other grieving parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody was walking around asking if you'd heard about their  
children,'' she said. ``You can't really say anything. You're just 
there for support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1997, a series of school shootings around the country have  
led to demands for stricter laws, tighter security and closer 
monitoring of troubled students. Two people were killed in an 
attack in Pearl, Miss., three in West Paducah, Ky., five in 
Jonesboro, Ark., and two in Springfield, Ore.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Discusses Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton backed away from a  
controversial statement she made last year about the importance of 
Palestinian statehood, saying she is against unilateral moves in 
the Middle East peace process. 
</P>
<P>
	``We oppose any unilateral step that prejudges the outcome of  
the negotiations,'' she said Tuesday to applause from the 700 
guests at a United Jewish Appeal dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	``If peace is to be realized, then all people and the leaders of  
all people must agree before they take any unilateral steps that 
would undermine the peace process. If peace is to be lasting, it 
has to be negotiated and agreed on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, in a satellite hookup with a youth conference in  
Switzerland, Mrs. Clinton caused an international stir with her 
comment: ``I think it will be in the long-term interests of the 
Middle East for Palestine to be a state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also called the goal ``very important for the Palestinian  
people'' and for the ``broader goal of peace in the Middle East.'' 
U.S. policy holds that the Palestinians must negotiate their future 
with the Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
	New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who is the likely  
Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in New York and whom Mrs. 
Clinton would face if she decided to run for the seat, has said 
that her remarks about the Palestinian state were ``a very big 
mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton did not specifically refer to the Palestinians in  
her remarks Tuesday night. But she was clearly alluding to concerns 
that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat might unilaterally declare 
statehood on May 4, when a five-year interim period of autonomy for 
the West Bank and Gaza Strip ends. 
</P>
<P>
	The UJA dinner, honoring the philanthropist-businessmen brothers  
Edgar and Charles Bronfman, came at the end of Mrs. Clinton's 
jam-packed two-day visit to the New York City area. She attended 
about a dozen events, delivering speeches on everything from health 
care to education to the empowerment of women. 
</P>
<P>
	She was to return to Washington, D.C., today, then visit Niagra  
Falls on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	She told reporters Monday that she still has not yet made a  
decision about whether she will run for Senate in New York next 
year to fill the seat being vacated by Sen. Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan.

<HEADLINE> Cancer Rates Drop, Mostly for Men </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cancer rates are continuing to inch down,  
thanks largely to drops in smoking -- but men are benefiting most 
from the progress, says the nation's annual report on cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Although they still suffer more cancer than women do, the rate  
of new cancer cases is dropping eight times faster for men than for 
women, says the study unveiled Tuesday by the American Cancer 
Society and government scientists. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, cancer incidence has dropped 2.2 percent a year since  
1992, says the report, published in this week's Journal of the 
National Cancer Institute, which analyzed cancer trends through 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists warned Tuesday that tobacco use could reverse the  
progress: Lung cancer remains the nation's top cancer killer, and 
recent declines in lung cancer among men who quit smoking in the 
1970s and '80s helped fuel the overall declines in cancer incidence 
and mortality. But high teen smoking and new popularity for cigars 
have experts fearing a rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless we invest now in anti-tobacco efforts aimed at our  
youngest citizens, we will waste the progress we have achieved so 
far,'' said Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, cigarette smoking by high school students rose a  
disturbing 32 percent during the 1990s, the report said. And cigar 
smoking -- which a second study concluded is as cancer-causing as 
cigarettes -- has reversed a 20-year decline, rising by 50 percent 
in the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to turn that around or we'll have another lung cancer  
epidemic,'' said Phyllis Wingo of the American Cancer Society, lead 
author of Tuesday's study. 
</P>
<P>
	Wingo used death certificates and huge government health  
databases to determine the rates of new cancer cases and cancer 
deaths through 1996, the latest data available. 
</P>
<P>
	Cancer incidence increased slowly from the 1970s through 1992 --  
but since then has steadily dropped, about 2.2 percent a year 
through 1996, the report said. It's falling faster for men, 4.1 
percent a year, compared with less than half a percent drop each 
year for women. 
</P>
<P>
	Cancer death rates also are dropping more for men, 1 percent a  
year, compared with 0.4 percent a year for women. 
</P>
<P>
	Why the gender gap? It's partly due to lung cancer.  
</P>
<P>
	Scientists have known for several years that lung cancer  
incidence was slowly decreasing among men, by about 2.6 percent a 
year. At the same time, however, lung cancer was becoming a 
steadily bigger problem for women, who began to quit smoking later 
than men did. During the 1990s, lung cancer deaths rose 1.4 percent 
a year among women. 
</P>
<P>
	But the new report shows a glimmer of hope that women might be  
about to turn that tide: When scientists looked just at women ages 
40 to 59 -- the age group that first began kicking the habit -- they 
found a slight decrease in lung cancer. That's the same age group 
in which the male lung cancer decline first appeared. So a similar 
finding in women is a clue that maybe women's fate is about to 
improve, too, Wingo explained. 
</P>
<P>
	Lung cancer aside, the study found improvement in fighting most  
forms of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	But two forms of cancer are increasing: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma  
and melanoma. New cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are rising by a 
little over half a percent per year and deaths are rising by 1.8 
percent a year. No one knows why. 
</P>
<P>
	The incidence rate of melanoma, caused by too much time in the  
sun, increased 2.7 percent a year during the 1990s, although death 
rates have remained unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Other findings:  
</P>
<P>
	--Although the death rate from breast cancer is dropping 2  
percent a year, there has been little change in breast cancer 
incidence, which strikes about 180,000 women a year. 
</P>
<P>
	--Uterine cancer levels stayed steady.  
</P>
<P>
	--When the report analyzed lung cancer by state, Kentucky had the  
highest male death rate -- 103.4 lung cancer deaths per 100,000 men 
-- and also the most teen smokers and adult male smokers. The most 
adult women smoked in Nevada, and most died of lung cancer there: 
45.8 per 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah had the lowest rates of smoking, and lung cancer death  
rates of just 31.5 for men and 13.9 for women.

<HEADLINE> Littleton School Shootings Timeline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A reconstruction of Tuesday's school shooting in Littleton,  
Colo. All times MDT: 
</P>
<P>
	11 a.m. -- About 900 Columbine High School students head into the  
cafeteria for lunch, hit the books in the library or in classrooms. 

</P>
<P>
	11:30 a.m. -- Two young men wearing long black trench coats  
approach the school. They pull out weapons and open fire in the 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
	They proceed inside, to the school cafeteria, shooting as they  
walk, then upstairs to the library, still shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	As bullets ricochet throughout the building, scores of students  
hide in closets, bathrooms, under tables and chairs. Some students, 
barricaded behind a heavy door, whisper of their terror over 
cell-phone calls to relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens more flee the building, hiding in bushes or sprinting to  
a nearby park. 

</P>
<P>
	Noon -- Police SWAT teams find several explosive devices around  
the school. Ambulances take first wounded students to area 
hospitals, all of whom managed to run outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Anguished parents, awaiting word on their children, gather at  
nearby Leawood elementary school. 

</P>
<P>
	12:30 p.m. -- SWAT teams begin room-by-room sweep of the high  
school, checking every knapsack and desk. 

</P>
<P>
	2:30 p.m. -- SWAT teams begin freeing students in hiding. In  
small groups, the students and teachers run from the building to a 
holding area, where they are frisked, questioned, offered medical 
care and then bused to Leawood elementary to be reunited with 
parents. 

</P>
<P>
	4 p.m. -- Sheriff's spokesman estimates as many as 25 people are  
dead, a combination of students and teachers. Officers searching 
the library find the bodies of both suspects, who apparently died 
of self-inflicted gunshot wounds. 

</P>
<P>
	4:30 p.m. -- SWAT teams declare school under control, but  
continue sweeps throughout the night. 

</P>
<P>
	6:15 p.m. -- Authorities find an explosive device in a car in the  
school parking lot. Sheriff's spokesman says entire school is 
regarded as a massive crime scene; campus marked off with yards of 
yellow tape. All bodies still inside. 

</P>
<P>
	10:30 p.m. -- Bomb on a timer blows up; no one injured.  

</P>
<P>
	Wednesday morning -- Police revise death toll to 15, based on a  
count of bodies.

<HEADLINE> New Park Pollution Rules Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writer-    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- There was a time when a visitor to the Great  
Smoky Mountains National Park could see more than 60 miles into 
Tennessee. Last summer the air was so bad it was deemed unhealthy 
on 43 days and the visibility often was down to 12 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	In Acadia National Park in Maine, the air last summer at times  
was as smoggy as the air over Boston or New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the country, from the Grand Canyon to Shenandoah National  
Park, air pollution often keeps visitors from seeing the sights in 
once pristine parks. 
</P>
<P>
	Marking another Earth Day, the Clinton administration was  
announcing new regulations today directing that states reduce 
pollution to bring air in 37 national parks and 119 federal 
wilderness areas back to pre-industrial-era quality -- though it 
will take more half a century even under the most optimistic 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans deserve to see their national parks in all their  
natural splendor,'' said Vice President Al Gore, who will travel to 
Shenandoah National Park 60 miles west of Washington to formally 
announce the new requirements under the federal Clean Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
	While the rules will give states discretion on how to reduce  
pollution that drifts into the parks from miles-distant sources, 
they will have to show significant air quality improvements every 
10 years, with a final deadline of 2064. The first pollution 
reduction plans are due in 2003 to 2008, depending on the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Air quality improvements will be based largely on improved  
visibility and elimination of the brown, yellow haze that has 
become common during the summer in many of the parks, officials 
said. In parks today, from 45 percent to 81 percent of visibility 
is lost on days with heavy ozone pollution, according to the 
Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	First proposed nearly two years ago, the EPA regulations have  
been the focus of intense lobbying by environmentalists and 
industry, including electric utilities who are blamed for much of 
the park pollution in the eastern half of the country because of 
emissions from coal-burning power plants. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulations, according to White House officials, will for  
the first time have a long-term requirement of bringing air quality 
back to where it was before the industrial revolution. It will give 
states 60 years from when they go into effect to reach the goal. 
</P>
<P>
	In the interim, the EPA will require states -- even those that  
have no parks -- to identify pollution sources that are contributing 
to park haze in their region and require major sources such as 
coal-burning power plants to install the most sophisticated control 
technology available. In some cases companies will be allowed to 
trade emissions credits to keep down costs. 
</P>
<P>
	No cost estimate could be obtained, but a National Academy of  
Sciences study several years ago said technology is available to 
dramatically reduce haze and smog in the more than 17,000 square 
miles of parks and wilderness regions being targeted. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a dramatic improvement over the status quo,'' said  
John Stanton, vice president of the National Environmental Trust, 
an environmental advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
	Armond Cohen, director of the Clean Air Task Force, a  
Boston-based consortium of 80 environmental groups, said he would 
have liked to see a shorter timetable, but called the rule a ``good 
first step'' in targeting coal-burning power plants in the Ohio 
Valley and the South. 
</P>
<P>
	While regional haze affects many parks in the West as well,  
Cohen said pollution, especially sulfur and small particulates from 
power plants, account for 70 percent of the haze problem in parks 
in the eastern half of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Electric utilities and other industries had urged the White  
House to extend the timetable beyond 60 years, questioning whether 
pre-industrial conditions can be achieved in such a time frame. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Bailey, vice president of the Edison Electric Institute,  
said, ``I don't think anybody knows'' whether the goal can be 
achieved. ``It could be difficult. We don't know,'' he said in an 
interview.

<HEADLINE> Unabomber Lawyer Won't Seek Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- An attorney for Theodore Kaczynski  
said Wednesday he won't seek a new trial for the Unabomber, who 
believes he was unfairly coerced into pleading guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	University of Virginia law professor Richard J. Bonnie said he  
met with Kaczynski earlier this month and told him that filing the 
motion ``would not be the best avenue for achieving his goals and 
that I would not be filing the motion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonnie said he expects Kaczynski to file his own motion for a  
new trial by May 4, the deadline. Kaczynski is in a federal prison 
in Florence, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	In 16 attacks between 1978 and 1995, the Unabomber killed three  
people and injured 29 others. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaczynski pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Sacramento in  
January 1998 and was sentenced to life in prison without the 
possibility of parole.

<HEADLINE> Leno Prepares for Indy 500 Pace Ride </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Leno 1, Letterman 0.  
</P>
<P>
	``Tonight Show'' host Jay Leno, who collects antique and classic  
cars, has gone one-up on late-night TV rival David Letterman, a 
race car owner and an Indianapolis native. 
</P>
<P>
	Letterman, a partner of former Indy winner Bobby Rahal, has  
attended the Indianapolis 500, but it's Leno who will be behind the 
wheel of the Chevrolet Monte Carlo pace car at the start of the May 
30 race. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fascinating ... just to visualize as you go around the  
track all the history that's going around with you,'' Leno said 
Tuesday after some driving lessons from former winner Parnelli 
Jones. ``I've been here about five or six times. I'm a great 
automotive history buff, so it's fun to kind of drive around, just 
drive around Indianapolis, go down the streets where Duesenberg 
lived, where Marmons were built, that kind of stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's a safe bet he didn't tour Letterman's old neighborhood.  
</P>
<P>
	The Rahal team, in which Letterman is a minority owner, competes  
in the Championship Auto Racing Teams series. The Indianapolis 500 
is part of the rival Indy Racing League. Unlike Letterman, Leno 
said he has never wanted to own a race team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sort of like to fix them up and then save them for the next  
guy. I know Dave gets a big kick out of it but, no, I never got 
into that aspect of it,'' Leno said. 
</P>
<P>
	With Jones at his side, Leno turned a couple dozen laps around  
the 2 1/2-mile oval in the red pace car. 
</P>
<P>
	His formula for doing well?  
</P>
<P>
	``You go around 90 mph and try to stay in the center,'' Leno  
quipped. ``You don't want to be a complete idiot and be bouncing 
off the walls. ... Not to say it can't be done. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really get nervous,'' he added. ``It's not my car.''  
</P>
<P>
	Leno said he has driven in some celebrity races but never  
seriously considered auto racing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Racing is like sex,'' he said. ``All guys think they're pretty  
good at it ... and you're not. You realize all these guys are 
world-class athletes. These (Indy drivers) are the Michael Jordans 
and the Willie Mayses (of racing). ... So it's fun to come out here 
and pretend, but I don't think for a moment I could actually do 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who won the Indy 500 in 1963, said Leno handled the Monte  
Carlo well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he's going to have any problems whatsoever. He  
picks it up right away,'' Jones said. ``I was doing most of the 
talking, the fact that it really pays to look a long ways around 
the turn, and if you start getting up out of the groove into the 
gray area, you better get out of the throttle. Obviously, he's well 
aware of that, and I think he got a little smoother as he ran each 
lap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said the comedian is taking his job as pace car driver  
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he realizes it takes no talent at all to run down  
there and hit the wall. Obviously, if you do something like that, 
you're just going to embarrass yourself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only other television personality to pace the Indy 500 is  
actor James Garner, who led the field in 1975, 1977 and 1985. 
Singer Marty Robbins drove the pace car in 1976.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T May Take Stake in Japan Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Telecommunications giants AT&AMP;T Corp. and British  
Telecommunications PLC have agreed to take a combined 30 percent 
stake in Japan Telecom Co., a report said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, AT&AMP;T and BT will each hold a 15 percent stake in  
Japan Telecom, Japan's third-largest long-distance telephone 
carrier, and gain a seat on the company's board of directors, the 
Nihon Keizai financial daily said. 
</P>
<P>
	The total size of their combined investment could be as much as  
$1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan Telecom spokesman Mitsuhiro Kurano said Thursday that the  
company has not yet decided to form a tie-up with AT&AMP;T and BT. He 
declined to comment on the details of the newspaper report. 
</P>
<P>
	The three firms are reportedly planning a broad alliance in  
which AT&AMP;T and BT will integrate most of their Japanese operations 
with Japan Telecom's units. 
</P>
<P>
	The three companies will offer Internet and other data  
communication services to multinational corporations and will also 
cooperate in neighboring Asian telecommunications markets, the 
Nihon Keizai said. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T is the largest long distance and international carrier in  
the United States, while BT is Britain's biggest telecommunications 
company. Japan Telecom is an affiliate of East Japan Railway Co.

	``He had a great day,'' said Janvrin, a coach at Central  
Missouri. ``He's very talented, but we've kind of butted heads 
about the way to do things sometimes. He's really shown his 
maturity. He's ready to compete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alcorn State's Millicent Sylvan, competing at Drake for the  
first time, led the heptathlon with 3,168 points. Wichita State's 
Mellanee Welty was second with 3,155. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan, 29, is in his fourth year as a decathlete. He moved to  
Warrensburg, Mo., a year ago specifically to train under Janvrin, 
who has topped the 8,000-point barrier more often than any 
American. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before that I was training myself,'' Sullivan said. ``I was a  
triple jumper out of Indiana University and I gave that up because 
I couldn't find a coach. And then I found a coach in Kip and ever 
since then, my numbers have been skyrocketing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan's best decathlon score is 7,086, a figure he's well on  
the way to topping. But winning the competition will be tough 
because Janvrin is so strong on the second day and has a big edge 
in experience. 
</P>
<P>
	This is Janvrin's 65th decathlon, Sullivan's 10th.  
</P>
<P>
	``He could beat me in two or three events tomorrow,'' Janvrin  
said. ``He's a really good hurdler, solid in the discus, a pretty 
good vaulter and average in the javelin. He doesn't run a great 
1,500 (meters), so obviously I've got that ace in the hole. But 
he's got some good events.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan is confident he'll do well on Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'd really be scared as a person trying to be a decathlete if  
I had a weak day,'' Sullivan said. ``But my days are steady just 
like his, so bring it on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan won the 100 meters and high jump, while Janvrin finish  
first in the long jump and 400. Montana State's Stevie Keller, 
third overall with 3,732 points, won the shot put. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not disappointed,'' Janvrin said. ``I really would have  
liked to run a little better 100 and maybe throw a little farther 
in the shot. But for the amount of work I'm putting into some of 
those events, I'm getting some pretty positive return right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sylvan, a two-time Southwestern Athletic Conference champion in  
the heptathlon, had personal bests in the 100 hurdles, high jump 
and 200. She won the hurdles and tied for first in the high jump. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had fun today,'' Sylvan said. ``I ran well in the hurdles.  
Even though I hit a hurdle, I still ran as fast as I've ever run. I 
did real well in the high jump and I PRed in the 200, so that's 
really exciting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karen Fink of Doane won the shot put and Northern Iowa's Kendra  
Stannard won the 200. Welty and Illinois State's Hillary Hyland and 
Kathrine Nelson tied Sylvan for first in the high jump.

<P>
	The Colorado Avalanche remember last year, the Dallas Stars two  
years ago. Both were eliminated in the first round of the National 
Hockey League playoffs on those occasions and are determined not to 
make an early exit again. 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche face the San Jose Sharks and the Stars play the  
Edmonton Oilers, both on home ice, as the playoffs open tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we took Edmonton seriously,'' said Colorado  
goaltender Patrick Roy, referring to last season's first-round 
upset by the Oilers. ``There were other circumstances, and one of 
them was playing in the Olympics. We don't have that excuse now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, the Stars also were shocked in the first round by  
the Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We learned a lot from that thing that happened two years  
ago,'' Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``We know not to overlook 
anybody. We learned our lesson.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other first-round games tonight, it's Anaheim at Detroit and  
Buffalo at Ottawa. The playoffs continue Thursday with Pittsburgh 
at New Jersey, Philadelphia at Toronto, Boston at Carolina and St. 
Louis at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche won the season series over San Jose 3-1, and have  
been one of the league's best teams in the second half. They 
finished the season with a 9-2-1 record, while the Sharks won only 
one of their last five games (1-3-1). 
</P>
<P>
	None of that matters now, Roy said.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have no reason not to be ready for this series. We learned  
that from last year, and we know that San Jose has a very good 
hockey team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roy perhaps has more motivation to play well against the Sharks,  
having been the target of recent disparaging remarks by San Jose 
captain Owen Nolan. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's either unbeatable or things just go flying by,'' Nolan  
said of Roy. ``He's never medium. If you get him off his game, he 
lets in some weird goals. If you get him rattled early, he feels 
like he has to do more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roy has been uncharacteristically quiet.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to get involved in that,'' Roy said. ``What I  
want to do is focus on what I have to do and play as well as I 
can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars, meanwhile, are not trying to make too much of their  
league-best record. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're confident, but we know the other teams can beat us if we  
play like a bunch of arrogant dogs,'' Stars forward Brett Hull 
said. ``If anybody thinks we're going to walk over a lower seeded 
team, they are sadly mistaken.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finishing with the best record in the NHL guarantees nothing.  
Ask the Detroit Red Wings, who won a record 62 games in the 1995-96 
season, yet were knocked out of the playoffs. In the 30 years since 
expansion, less than half the teams that had the highest point 
total in the regular season managed to win the Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being the No. 1 seed is a burden you have to accept,''  
Hitchcock said. ``You know that going in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The best a team can hope for is that it is playing well going  
into the playoffs. The Red Wings have been 9-2-1 since acquiring 
several experienced players, including defenseman Chris Chelios, at 
the trading deadline in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``He plays every shift like it could be his last,'' said Anaheim  
coach Craig Hartsburg, who coached Chelios with the Chicago 
Blackhawks. ``He is a warrior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Dominik Hasek playing for Buffalo and Ron Tugnutt for  
Ottawa, goals figure to be scarce in the Sabres-Senators series. 
Hasek is generally considered to be the best goalie in the league 
and Tugnutt had the best goals-against average. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams played five times this season, resulting in four ties  
and a 3-2 overtime victory for Ottawa.

<HEADLINE> IOC Monthly Reform Report Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- International Olympic Committee board  
member Kevan Gosper has rejected calls for monthly updates on 
reform prompted by the Olympics bribery scandal and says the U.S. 
Congress should leave the IOC to make its own changes. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Sen. John McCain told IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch  
in a letter this week that ``significant skepticism'' remains in 
Congress and among the public that the Olympic committee will enact 
``comprehensive and meaningful reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain called for monthly updates to be provided to the Senate  
Commerce Committee, which examined the Salt Lake City Olympic 
bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gosper said today the IOC board would not consider it  
appropriate to provide any government with monthly reports on 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we have any responsibility to report to the  
Senate committee on an ongoing basis,'' Gosper told a Foreign 
Correspondents Association luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know any international corporations doing (that). I  
don't know any U.S. corporations doing it, and don't know why we 
should be asked to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ten IOC members have resigned or been expelled in the scandal,  
which involved a million-dollar scheme to buy votes in Salt Lake's 
successful quest for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper said the IOC's response, including the creation of an IOC  
ethics commission, of which he is a member, demonstrated that it is 
serious about reform. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Congress has made some useful recommendations on  
reform, but the IOC is an international organization which is 
accountable to the government of no one country, Gosper said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am surprised he (McCain) didn't give us more credit and I am  
surprised that some of his members suggested that putting in place 
the ethics commission ... is not seen as more than a public 
relations exercise,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain told Samaranch he was dismayed that the IOC had failed to  
embrace the recommendations of a special ethics panel headed by 
former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell. The senator said he 
also was concerned that the IOC was dragging its feet on 
restructuring and other internal changes, and that the whole 
process still answered to Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper said IOC members had strongly endorsed Samaranch to  
remain and take responsibility for the crisis and oversee reform. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the ship gets into trouble, you don't rush up to the  
captain's cabin and throw him overboard,'' Gosper said. ``In fact, 
you rush up to make sure he doesn't jump overboard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was understandable that the United States would seek to help  
solve the problem, but just because it is a powerful nation is not 
a reason for the IOC to adopt all the American reforms, Gosper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a simple oversight to say that because a high proportion  
of the corporations that sponsor and work as partners are from the 
United States, then all the money comes from the United States and 
the United States must have a key say in all events,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics committee, which has a majority of members from  
outside the IOC, will meet for the first time on May 3. A one-day 
meeting of the IOC board will follow the day after. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper said an ongoing investigation into Australian IOC member  
Phil Coles would likely be handed to the ethics commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, who was given a severe reprimand after the Salt Lake  
investigation, has since been accused of accepting some $6,300 
worth of jewelry from someone associated with Athens' failed bid 
for the 1996 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper said if the board had completed its investigation of  
Coles by the time of the first ethics commission meeting, it would 
hand over the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this stage we haven't come up with a decision, and my  
judgment is that probably the Phil Coles file will go to the ethics 
commission,'' said Gosper.

</P>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- A kid in a white shirt heaved something  
up onto the high school roof, and it exploded in billowing smoke. 
Sophomore Don Arnold thought it was just a lunchtime prank, a 
firecracker maybe. 
</P>
<P>
	Then students started falling.  
</P>
<P>
	``One boy was running and suddenly his ankle just puffed up in  
blood,'' said the 16-year-old Arnold. ``A girl was running and her 
head popped open'' when a bullet slammed into her skull. 
</P>
<P>
	They were the first to be shot in Tuesday's bloody attack at  
Columbine High School outside Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnold's girlfriend, Lindsay Hamilton, 15, was inside the school  
reviewing for a biology test when she heard shots and explosions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good day to die!'' she said someone yelled at one  
point. ``We want everyone to die!'' 
</P>
<P>
	She and 30 other biology students holed up in the science room  
with their teacher for four hours while unspeakable tragedy 
unfolded outside. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack ended only when two suspects who had stalked through  
hallways spraying bullets apparently killed themselves in the 
school library just down the hall. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time Hamilton was reunited with Arnold -- after a SWAT  
team escorted her class around puddles of blood -- 15 people were 
dead, including the shooters. 
</P>
<P>
	Many students were in the cafeteria when the assault on  
Columbine High began. The first lunch shift started at 11:10 a.m. 
and was in full swing when food server Karen Nielsen heard someone 
yell, ``Get down!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen said she heard shots coming from outside and rushed to a  
window. She saw three victims outside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was on automatic,'' she said. ``It was just, 'get to the  
wounded.''' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the boys felled outside the cafeteria door had been shot  
in the face, another was shot in the back. The third looked dead. 
Nielsen ran back inside and called 911. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's deputies responded swiftly, but at least two hours  
ticked by before officers surrounded the building and moved in. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had initial people there right away, but we couldn't get  
in,'' Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone said. ``We were way 
outgunned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Students described their attackers as heavily armed -- with  
semiautomatic weapons and an assault rifle, some said -- and one 
student said one of the shooters took off his ankle-length black 
coat to reveal what appeared to be hand grenades. 
</P>
<P>
	When the attackers strode into the cafeteria, ``Everyone was  
trying to crawl at first, but then someone got up and ran, and 
everybody was running,'' said freshman Chris Donnelly, 15. ``I saw 
someone bleeding on the floor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearby, Nielsen was hiding with several other employees in the  
restroom of the teachers' lounge. They cringed when the attackers 
banged on other doors, shouting, ``We know you're in there,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Terrible moments passed. The shooting receded. One person  
ventured out hesitantly -- and saw wounded students strewn across 
the cafeteria. He returned to hiding in the lounge. 
</P>
<P>
	When Nielsen escaped about 90 minutes after the first shots, the  
two wounded students she'd seen were gone; the dead body was still 
there. According to students, the attackers next targeted the 
library, shooting as they walked up the stairs and down the hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Many hours later, after law officers had swept the school,  
checking every abandoned bookbag, backpack and gym satchel for 
explosives, the sheriff assessed the carnage on the second floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The library was one of the last rooms we entered, and it was  
the most gruesome,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Surrounding the bodies of the attackers, both juniors at  
Columbine, were the bodies of 10 of their victims. 
</P>
<P>
	SWAT teams began freeing clusters of panicked students and  
teachers from their hiding places about 2:30 p.m. Live television 
feeds showed them sprinting from the school, most with hands held 
high overhead, to holding areas where they were frisked, questioned 
and offered medical care. 
</P>
<P>
	Many survivors were reunited with anxious loved ones at a nearby  
elementary school. But it took a few more hand-wringing moments. 
Parents watched their precious children from a distance, but could 
not immediately speak with them or embrace them, while authorities 
finished their questioning on the school stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Other parents suffered a night of sinking desperation, their  
eyes scanning lists of students accounted for, either unharmed or 
in hospitals -- but not finding the names they love. 
</P>
<P>
	With the risk of rigged explosives deemed too high to continue  
their investigation overnight, authorities had no choice but to 
shut down the crime scene -- with bodies scattered throughout the 
Colorado high school.

<HEADLINE> White House Favors Selling Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration thinks it is a good  
idea for the International Monetary Fund to sell some of its gold 
to help reduce the debt burden of poor countries, Deputy Treasury 
Secretary Larry Summers said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a sale, which Congress would have to approve, would be  
conducted carefully to minimize harm to gold holders, producers in 
Nevada and the gold market in general, Summers told a House Banking 
subcommittee on international monetary policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Several lawmakers have said they want to examine any  
administration proposal to sell IMF gold. Other wealthy G-7 nations 
also have called for tapping the gold to finance an IMF-World Bank 
debt relief initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said the initiative would  
be discussed at the spring meetings of the two organizations just 
getting under way. The G-7 nations also will tackle the subject at 
their summit in June in Cologne, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Camdessus said there was a ``proliferation of proposals'' from  
the IMF's major shareholders to increase debt relief for the 
world's poorest nations, most of them in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is broad consensus the time has come to take further  
steps to reduce debt,'' Camdessus said, but governments still have 
to decide how they will pay to do this. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers said the amount of gold the IMF is considering selling  
is dwarfed by the amount of gold that typically comes into the 
market each year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The London gold market alone has a daily turnover of the order  
of 850 to 1,200 tons,'' Summers said. ``Against this, the sale of 
150 to 300 tons, over the space of quite a number of years, would 
be small fry, indeed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We think that mobilizing a modest amount of the IMF's gold in  
this way is a sensible and prudent approach,'' Summers said, ``and 
is far preferable to an ever greater reliance on bilateral 
contributions from IMF members'' to the debt relief initiative.

<HEADLINE> Soybean, Grain Futures Drop / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly  
lower in early dealings today on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts attributed the drop to reports of drier weather in the  
Plains states. Rain and cooler temperatures had been delaying 
spring planting and threatening some winter crops. 
</P>
<P>
	But forecasters are calling for drier conditions next week.  
</P>
<P>
	Analysts also say reports of good progress in the South American  
soybean harvest is affecting prices. A bigger supply means lower 
cash prices at harvest time. 
</P>
<P>
	In early trading today, wheat for May delivery fell 1 1/4 cents to  
$2.57 1/4 a bushel; May corn dropped 1/4 cent to $2.23 3/4 a bushel; May 
oats fell 3/4 cents to $1.23 1/4 a bushel; and May soybeans were down 1 3/4 
cents to $4.93 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	In early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, livestock  
and pork belly futures also fell. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle dropped .13 cent to 63.57 cents a pound; May  
feeder cattle fell .07 cent to 71.55 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
dropped .60 cent to 55.37 cents a pound; and May pork bellies fell 
2.35 cents to 52.50 cents a pound.

highway helped firefighters block a huge wildfire from advancing 
farther through a sea of dry sawgrass. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're winding down on this one, we hope,'' said John Fish, a  
spokesman for the state Division of Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
	By Tuesday night the fire had burned across 160,000 acres. If  
firefighters keep it contained, the blaze should burn out after 
blackening an additional 10,000 acres, Fish said. 
</P>
<P>
	Early today, heavy smoke and low visibility prompted authorities  
to again close Interstate 75, the main east-west highway through 
the Everglades known as Alligator Alley. 
</P>
<P>
	John Cataldo, a spokesman for the Florida Highway Patrol, said  
the highway was closed as a temporary precaution. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire, in a section of the Everglades' roughly 2 million  
acres that is outside Everglades National Park, sent up columns of 
smoke visible from miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, flames licked just past the edge of the mostly  
undeveloped Miccosukee Indian Reservation, located in the 
Everglades about 60 miles west of Fort Lauderdale. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty Navajo firefighters from Arizona were reassigned from the  
fire's western edge to the north side to try to keep flames from 
spreading north of a canal that runs along Broward County's 
northern boundary, and they were joined by 20 other Navajos, Fish 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to make sure the fire doesn't escape the area we have  
it confined to,'' Fish said. ``We're considering it contained but 
still not under control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fire began in the eastern Everglades late last week and may  
have been ignited by heat from a vehicle's catalytic converter. The 
cause was still being investigated, Fish said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fanned by erratic wind, the blaze quickly became the largest of  
at least 2,568 fires that have burned more than 230,000 acres in 
Florida this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in the state, two fires were burning in the  
Apalachicola National Forest in Wakulla County, said Liz Compton, a 
spokeswoman for the state Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither threatened any homes or property, although one advanced  
to within 20 miles of Tallahassee, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	With rainfall far below normal during Florida's  
December-through-April dry season, officials fear a repeat of last 
summer, when nearly 500,000 acres burned and 100,000 people were 
forced from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Everglades, fire is part of a natural cycle that  
regularly burns away accumulated dry brush. Charred debris left 
behind by the flames will serve as a fertilizer, spurring new plant 
growth, said Tom Fontaine, an ecologist with the South Florida 
Water Management District. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ecosystem's going to be fine,'' he said. ``It will come  
back very much like it was before.''

<HEADLINE> Senators Discuss Internet Privacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Companies that do business on the Internet are  
asking Congress not to move too quickly to regulate electronic 
commerce, arguing self-regulation and public education may be the 
best way to solve Internet privacy concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Market forces supply more than enough incentives for business to  
either protect privacy, or lose customers who don't trust Internet 
security, Irving Wladawsky-Berger, IBM Corp.'s Internet division 
general manager, told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, the Internet is too young, too complicated and  
changing too quickly for lawmakers to know what laws would work 
best, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels like every month something new develops,'' he told  
the committee. ``A new statute is not the answer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Interest in doing something about Internet privacy is running  
high, however. Members of Congress have introduced more than 50 
bills to protect Internet surfers from such things as having 
personal information passed from company to company, said Sen. 
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry should do its best to regulate itself if it wants  
to head off restrictive legislation, Hatch said. ``The last thing 
you want is for us to come in with a heavy hand ... and that's 
where it's headed,'' he told a panel of industry players testifying 
before the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said he was reassured by the  
privacy policies described by the panel, but still concerned about 
less reputable companies that don't care about safeguarding 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``By definition a bad actor doesn't submit to self- or industry  
regulation,'' Schumer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., agreed, saying ``the jury is  
still out on self-regulation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	America Online worries about companies that may undermine  
efforts at self-regulation, ``but we worry more about legislation 
that is too quick,'' said Katherine Borsecnik, an America Online 
senior vice president. ``I worry that that will be viewed as 
shortsighted in retrospect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wladawsky-Berger said many privacy problems involve acts that  
already are illegal and that by extending current laws to cover the 
Internet would stop many of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said he was working on legislation  
that would extend the constitutional protections against 
unreasonable government searches and seizures to networked computer 
environments. 
</P>
<P>
	``In addition, several provisions in the bill will address the  
concern Americans have about the use of their personally 
identifiable records and information by businesses, satellite 
carriers, libraries and book sellers,'' Leahy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., said he and Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio,  
were working on legislation that would create a commission to study 
Internet privacy problems.

<HEADLINE>  Gandhi Can Form India Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- India's Congress Party will be able to  
muster enough support in two days to form a minority government, 
the party's leader said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sonia Gandhi claimed to have a slight majority of 272 seats in  
the 543-member legislature and promised to deliver letters of 
support by Friday. She said questions about whether she would be 
prime minister were ``premature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President K.R. Narayanan asked Mrs. Gandhi ``to explore the  
possibility'' of forming a government -- a preliminary step giving 
Congress the first opportunity to replace the Hindu nationalist 
government and its prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who lost a 
confidence motion in parliament by one vote Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Congress Party is willing to form a government of its own  
with outside support,'' Mrs. Gandhi told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	However, many of parliament's smaller, pivotal parties that Mrs.  
Gandhi said were backing Congress met late Wednesday. They are 
pushing for a coalition backed by Congress and oppose a stand-alone 
Congress administration as proposed by Mrs. Gandhi. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot do without the Congress, but the Congress will have  
to come off its high horse. The numbers are such,'' said Amar 
Singh, spokesman of the Rashtriya Loktantrik Morcha. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of Vajpayee, who is serving as a caretaker until a  
new government is formed, attacked Mrs. Gandhi's Italian heritage, 
accused her party of offering money and jobs to sway votes, and 
challenged her numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	``No party has so far given her unconditional support,'' a  
senior leader of Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi, 51, adopted Indian citizenship 16 years after her  
marriage to Rajiv Gandhi, who was prime minister until 1989. He was 
assassinated in 1991, and his mother, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, 
was assassinated in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the budget was to be adopted without debate Wednesday,  
lawmakers opened the session by standing at their seats and yelling 
accusations of Congress bribery. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi denied the accusations. ``This is a habit of the BJP  
to accuse others of the things they in fact do,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite four adjournments, no vote was taken on the budget.  
</P>
<P>
	If no one can form what would be India's fourth government since  
1996, the country will hold its third national election in three 
years.

<HEADLINE> Colo. School Had Discussed Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Just a week before the massacre at Columbine High,  
the staff took part in a crisis handling session prompted by last 
year's string of school shootings around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The staff members at the five-hour seminar discussed escape  
routes in a shooting attack, how to deal with wounded students and 
how to notify relatives in an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the shooting rampage at a Springfield, Ore., high  
school that left two students dead last May, Jefferson County 
school administrators had also asked that safety plans be drafted 
for each campus building. But the reports weren't due until the end 
of this school year. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, district spokesman Kay Pride defended the security  
measures taken before Tuesday's massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we took all the reasonable steps,'' she said. ``It was  
based on the best expert advice we could get, so I don't know how 
we could have done any better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She added: ``Human behavior is not always responsible to your  
best efforts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evie Hudak, a public policy director for the Colorado state PTA,  
said: ``There's no way you can predict some wacko walking in. What 
we would have to do to prevent it would really infringe on 
everybody's day-to-day life in a ridiculous way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No metal detectors are used on district campuses. Ms. Pride said  
the district had had no major security breaches until Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty students were permanently expelled for bringing weapons  
during the last school year to Jefferson County schools, Ms. Hudak 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	When the shooting began, one sheriff's deputy was at the school,  
as usual, Ms. Pride said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said deputies exchanged gunfire  
with the killers within minutes of the first shots. A makeshift 
SWAT team went in about 20 minutes later, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't have any idea how many assailants or where they  
were, and a dead officer is not going to help anyone,'' Davis said. 
``If we stormed the building, we'd have no idea who's the victim 
and who's the suspect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All Jefferson County schools were closed Wednesday as officials  
began another security evaluation of each building. Security will 
be tightened at every entrance when class resumes, district 
spokesman Rick Kaufman said.

<HEADLINE> Charles Ng's Father: I Beat Him </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- The father of Charles Ng choked back  
tears as he confessed to a jury that he beat his son to make him a 
better person but instead produced a serial killer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to bring him up right,'' Kenneth Ng said Tuesday in  
Chinese-accented English. ``Unfortunately, I use the wrong way. I 
think this is normal. But now I know how wrong I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He came from Hong Kong to help defense lawyers try to save his  
son from the death penalty. Jurors also could recommend life in 
prison without possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Ng, 38, a Hong Kong emigre, was convicted of  
participating in 11 killings in Northern California during 1984-85 
engineered by his survivalist friend, Leonard Lake, who committed 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	His mother was scheduled as the last defense witness today in  
the penalty phase of her son's trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers have presented evidence that Ng's harsh  
upbringing made him a dependent personality who sought approval 
from a dominating figure such as Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenneth Ng described how when Charles failed to do his  
schoolwork, ``Sometimes I tie his hands and I beat him really hard. 
... Now I look back and maybe this not the way to teach children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He choked back tears at times, and three jurors and an  
alternated dabbed their eyes with tissues. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Ng said his goal was to see that his children got the  
education he did not have. 
</P>
<P>
	``I must say I didn't give them much freedom,'' he said. ``We  
were brought up the hard way and I thought that was the right way 
to bring up my babies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Ng occasionally looked at his father but showed no  
emotions. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside court, Lola Stapley, mother of victim Scott Stapley,  
said she was moved by the father's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``My heart bleeds for him, absolutely bleeds for him,'' said  
Mrs. Stapley. ``But Charles has to take responsibility for his 
actions.''

<HEADLINE> MD-11 Wiring Inspections Ordered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- MD-11 aircraft must undergo emergency wiring  
inspections because mechanics found a loose wire in the cargo hold 
of one airplane. 
</P>
<P>
	An emergency airworthiness directive, issued by the Federal  
Aviation Administration late Friday but made public Tuesday, is the 
latest in a series of inspections and emergency repairs ordered in 
the aftermath of last September's crash of Swissair Flight 111. 
</P>
<P>
	That investigation is focusing on wiring in the cockpit and  
entertainment systems of the Swissair plane, also a Boeing MD-11, 
and investigators do not believe the latest discovery explains that 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-to-Geneva flight plunged into the ocean off Nova  
Scotia, 16 minutes after the pilots reported smoke in the cockpit. 
All 229 aboard were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, mechanics have paid close attention to all wiring on  
the planes. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the FAA said: ``While performing routine  
maintenance on an MD-11, mechanics found evidence of wire chafing 
in the cargo loader control unit and burnt insulation. They also 
discovered that a wiring harness support bracket and clamp that 
supports a wire bundle may not have been installed on the 
aircraft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Operators of the MD-11 were required to perform inspections,  
verify the installation of the bracket and clamp and repair any 
damaged wires within five days. Findings must be reported to the 
FAA within 10 days after completion of the inspections.

<HEADLINE>  Woman Hit by Wild Pitch Gets $2.5M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- A woman struck in the face by a  
wild warmup pitch during a Florida Marlins game was awarded $2.5 
million by a jury for injuries that left her with lingering 
headaches and concentration problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Postlethwaite was injured by an errant pitch by former  
Philadelphia reliever Mitch Williams, who was warming up in the 
bullpen during a Phillies-Marlins game Aug. 8, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Postlethwaite, 48, actually will receive $972,000 from Tuesday's  
verdict. Additional money will come from confidential settlements 
reached with the Marlins, former Marlins owner Wayne Huizenga and 
stadium designer HOK Sports. 
</P>
<P>
	The Robbie company will owe Postlethwaite $850,500 and the  
Phillies $121,500, for a total of $972,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, nicknamed ``Wild Thing'' because of his scattershot  
arm, was warming up in the eighth inning when he uncorked a pitch 
that sailed into the stands. It struck Postlethwaite between the 
eyes and sent her to the hospital with a broken nose. 
</P>
<P>
	The former PaineWebber stockbroker hasn't worked since the  
accident and still has headaches and problems with concentration, 
according to her lawyer.

	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris hurled  
insults at Jews, blacks and Hispanics at Columbine High School. But 
they REALLY hated the athletes, who had power and popularity -- 
everything they didn't. 
</P>
<P>
	``All jocks stand up!'' one of the attackers yelled during their  
murderous spree Tuesday. ``We're going to kill every one of you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They killed 13 people in the deadliest school massacre in recent  
years. Then Klebold and Harris turned their guns on themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	A horrible as their assault on classmates was, it did not come  
out of the blue: Klebold, Harris and others in a band of outcasts 
who called themselves the Trenchcoat Mafia had a long-running feud 
with Columbine athletes, including a recent confrontation in which 
the ``mafioso'' showed up carrying swords and brass knuckles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Trenchcoat Mafia was no secret society. Members posed for a  
yearbook photo last year. They had their own special spot in the 
cafeteria, near the stairs. They wore black trench coats -- no 
matter the season -- and berets with Nazi crosses. They openly 
admired Hitler. They spoke constantly of war and guns, and Harris 
had made a video at school in which he bragged about his new guns. 
</P>
<P>
	After Paducah and Edinboro, Jonesboro and Springfield, how could  
such provocative behavior not raise alarm? 
</P>
<P>
	Rather easily, it turns out.  
</P>
<P>
	If fellow students at Columbine were concerned -- and some now  
say they were -- they said little to adults, figuring they could 
handle these troublesome misfits themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	If teachers and police noticed, they passed it off as teen-age  
rebellion, unpopular kids looking for a sense of belonging. 
</P>
<P>
	And if parents like Steve Cohn worried about their children's  
safety, they rested easy knowing that Columbine High was the nicest 
of schools in the nicest of areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We moved here 11 years ago because of the schools,'' Cohn  
said. ``It's been a great neighborhood. Until now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohn's son, Aaron, 15, narrowly escaped execution Tuesday. Lying  
on his stomach in the library, Aaron cowered as one of the masked 
gunmen leveled a shotgun at his head. A few moments earlier, a girl 
had jumped on Cohn's back, covering the baseball slogan on his 
shirt. The gunman moved on and chose another victim. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	A few weeks ago, the big news at Columbine High was pranksters  
putting Superglue in all the outside door locks. 
</P>
<P>
	Most cliques here would be familiar on any U.S. high school  
campus: band kids, nerds, stoners, skateboarders and, at the top of 
the pecking order, athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Harder to label were the dozen members of the Trenchcoat Mafia.  
Some fellow students described them as resembling ``Gothics,'' 
sharing a penchant for black clothes and ghoulish makeup. Their 
long black dusters fit the Gothic style, but also that of Old West 
villains. Members of the group simply said the coats kept them 
warm. 
</P>
<P>
	Their interest in Hitler and World War II was well-known around  
school. They played war games and bragged about their guns. Harris 
and Klebold sometimes spoke German in the hallways and made 
references to ``4-20,'' Hitler's birthday, said Aaron Cohn, who 
lives five doors down from the tidy, two-story home on a quiet 
cul-de-sac where Harris' family moved in a couple years ago. The 
massacre took place on Hitler's birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohn said Harris, 18, was nonetheless a quiet kid who hadn't  
caused him any problems in the past. Other neighbors echoed that. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a nice guy,'' said Matt Good, 16, who lives two doors  
away. ``Shy person, didn't say much. I'd see him walk from the car 
to the house, and that's about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris' parents were nowhere in sight this week as reporters  
streamed past their home. Neighbors said they didn't know much 
about the family, except that the father was a retired military 
man. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris and Klebold were arrested last year for breaking into a  
car and completed their probation in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Klebold, 17, and other Trenchcoats had reputations for being  
smart and skilled at computers. Choir teacher Lee Andres remembers 
the 6-foot-4, blond Klebold as a smart kid. He ran the sound for 
one of last year's school musicals. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were extremely bright, but not good students,'' Andres  
told the Denver Rocky Mountain News. ``They disliked authority. 
They did not like to be told what to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By all accounts, they held a special hatred for athletes -- a  
contempt returned in good measure. John Duven said his teen-age 
son, a jock, almost got into a fight with them last year, but Duven 
talked him out of it. 
</P>
<P>
	The hostilities resurfaced this year.  
</P>
<P>
	``A couple of months ago, the jocks were supposed to fight  
them,'' said Good, a football player. They made a date to rumble: a 
Friday night at a baseball field. The jocks showed up, but the 
Trenchcoats were two hours late, and they went to the wrong spot, 
Good said. They also showed up carrying swords and brass knuckles -- 
not the jocks' idea of a clean fight. The rumble was never 
rescheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	``The jocks said forget it,'' Good said.  
</P>
<P>
	School officials said they'd had no discipline problems with  
Klebold or Harris, and they passed under the radar of the Jefferson 
County Sheriff's Department, said spokesman Steve Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	After the shooting, investigators questioned other members, but  
Davis said there was no indication other members took part in the 
actual shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Cohn finds it hard to believe that school authorities or  
police didn't notice the group. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wasn't it obvious, to someone?'' he asked. ``All the kids knew  
about it. You'd think a teacher would notice. You'd think the 
sheriff's department would know.''

        *No. 1 New Jersey (47-24-11) vs. No. 8 Pittsburgh (38-30-14)

<P>
	1998-99 Series Record: New Jersey 4-1-0.  
</P>
<P>
	Outlook: The Devils earned third consecutive Eastern Conference  
title, under first-year coach Robbie Ftorek. The pressure is on 
after last year's disappointing first-round loss to Ottawa, which 
followed a second-round exit the year before. The Devils scored 248 
goals, second in the league behind Toronto. New Jersey had an 
NHL-record 28 road victories, and goalie Martin Brodeur (39-21-10) 
tied Ken Dryden's NHL record with 25 road wins. Brodeur's 
goals-against average went up almost one-half goal to 2.29. A more 
open system than under former coach Jacques Lemaire has resulted in 
two scoring lines -- with the Patrik Elias-Jason Arnott-Petr Sykora 
line more consistent than Bobby Holik-Dave Andreychuk-Randy McKay. 
Sykora led team with 29 goals and 72 points. Holik (64 points) had 
three goals and two assists in the last four games. The Devils are 
healthy and won eight of 10 to close out the season. New Jersey 
outscored Pittsburgh 17-13 in the season series. The Penguins 
exited the playoffs in the first round the last two years and have 
stumbled heading in this year, finishing 2-8-2 to fall to the 
eighth spot. Jaromir Jagr won the scoring title for the second 
straight year with 44 goals and a league-leading 83 assists. Darius 
Kasparaitis is out for the season, while German Titov (hamstring) 
and Neil Wilkinson are day-to-day. Jagr overcame a groin injury in 
the final weeks and is the key to the team's success. Tom Barrasso 
(19-16-3, 2.55 GAA) had to overcome a broken wrist. New Jersey in 6 
games.

<P>
	1998-99 Series Record: Ottawa 1-0-4.  
</P>
<P>
	Outlook: Senators earned third straight playoff berth, falling  
two points behind New Jersey for the conference's top spot. Ottawa 
had first place heading into final week, but struggled down the 
stretch, finishing with a 2-2-5 mark. Alexei Yashin (44 goals, 94 
points) emerged as the offensive leader as Daniel Alfredsson (11 
goals, 22 points in 58 games) was bothered by injuries. The 
expected return of LW Shawn McEachern (31 goals) from a groin 
injury should help. Goalie Ron Tugnutt (22-10-8) had a 1.79 GAA -- 
just .02 from equaling the modern NHL record shared by Chicago's 
Tony Esposito and Toronto's Al Rollins. Tugnutt and Damian Rhodes 
(22-13-7, 2.44 GAA) share the goaltending duties. All five of the 
regular-season matchups went to overtime -- with the last three 
ending 1-1. Andreas Dackell provided the series' lone game winner 
on Dec. 30 at Buffalo. The Senators won the special teams matchups, 
converting 5 of 29 power-play opportunities while fighting off all 
27 short-handed situations. Dominik Hasek (30-18-14, nine 
shutouts), second to Tugnutt with a 1.87 GAA, is likely to win his 
third straight Vezina Trophy -- fifth in six years -- as the NHL's 
top goalie. The two-time defending MVP had a .955 save percentage 
(170 of 178) against the Senators. Hasek is the key in this series, 
as the Sabres will need him to counter Ottawa's considerable edge 
in shots. Buffalo will also need timely scoring from Miroslav Satan 
(40 goals, 66 points) and Michael Peca (27 goals -- eight 
game-winners) to prolong the series. Ottawa in 6.

</P>
<P>
	1998-99 Series Record: Tied 2-2-1.  
</P>
<P>
	Outlook: The Hurricanes' first postseason appearance since 1992,  
when the franchise was the Hartford Whalers. It's also their best 
season since 1989-90. Carolina finished with a four-game unbeaten 
streak (2-0-2). Despite the eighth-best record in the conference, 
Hurricanes get No. 3 seed for winning the Southeast Division. 
Defenseman Sean Hill (cheekbone) is out 2-4 weeks and could see 
action if Carolina advances. Captain Keith Primeau (back) and RW 
Ray Sheppard (shoulder) are day-to-day. Primeau led the team with 
30 goals and 62 points. Sami Kapanen had 59 points and Sheppard 58. 
Arturs Irbe (27-20-12, 2.22 GAA) had six shutouts. The Bruins, with 
the league's worst record two years ago, have rebuilt into one of 
the league's top young teams. Boston won seven of nine to close out 
the season and benefit from losing the season finale to 
Philadelphia, thereby avoiding a better Toronto team in the first 
round. Byron Dafoe (32-23-11, 1.99 GAA) led the league with 10 
shutouts, becoming the first Boston goalie in 60 years to reach 
that mark. Coach Pat Burns' constant shuffling of line combinations 
resulted in five players reaching the 20-goal plateau. Jason 
Allison led the team in scoring (23 goals, 76 points). Dmitiri 
Khristich (29 goals, 71 points) improved in his second year with 
the team. Defenseman Ray Bourque had 57 points and Sergei Samsonov 
(25 goals, 51 points) had a solid second season. Anson Carter and 
Steve Heinze had 40 points apiece. Boston in 6.

</P>
<P>
	Outlook: The Maple Leafs, the league's highest scoring team (268  
goals), had six 20-goal scorers. Toronto returns to postseason 
after two-year absence. Leading goal-scorer Sergei Berezin (37 
goals, 59 points) may miss the series after possible fractured 
cheekbone resulting from collision in the season finale. Mats 
Sundin (31 goals, 83 points) led the team in scoring again. Steve 
Thomas (28 goals, 73 points) had his best output since 1993-94. 
Derek King had 52 points, and Mike Johnson and Steve Sullivan added 
20 goals apiece. Yanic Perreault, acquired from Los Angeles in 
trade-deadline deal, exceeded expectations with seven goals and 15 
points in 12 games. Alyn McCauley (concussion) is out indefinitely 
and Igor Korolev (fractured finger) could be back in a couple of 
weeks. Curtis Joseph (35-24-7, 2.56 GAA) set a club record for 
victories. Flyers might have been better off with No. 6 seed amd a 
matchup with the less formidable Hurricanes. Eric Lindros (43 
goals, 93 points) is out indefinitely after surgery to remove a 
blood clot and fix complications from a collapsed lung. Mark Recchi 
(53 points) was cleared to play. Rod Brind'Amour (24 goals, 74 
points) takes over as the center on the first line, joined by 
Mikael Renberg (38 points) and John LeClair (43 goals, 90 points). 
After a midseason 24-game unbeaten string (16-0-8), the Flyers lost 
11 of the next 17. John Vanbiesbrouck (27-18-15, 2.18 GAA) could 
extend the series if he's at the top of his game. However, 
Philadelphia faces a quick exit without Lindros. Toronto in 5.

</P>
<P>
	1998-99 Series Record: Dallas 3-0-1.  
</P>
<P>
	Outlook: Third consecutive year teams meet in postseason. Stars  
won in five games in conference semifinals last year. Dallas 
captured Presidents' Trophy for second straight year, setting team 
records in home wins (29), overall wins and points (114). Stars 
were eighth in the league in scoring, but first in defense. Dallas 
is led by captain Mike Modano (34 goals, 81 points) and Brett Hull 
(32 goals). Modano returned from a hip injury and appears to be 
healthy. Joe Nieuwendyk (55 points), Jere Lehtinen (52 points) and 
defenseman Sergei Zubov (51 points) must contribute if Stars are to 
contend for the Stanley Cup. Derian Hatcher has five games 
remaining on suspension from hit that broke the jaw of Phoenix 
center Jeremy Roenick. Pat Verbeek (strained knee) could miss the 
first round. Goalies Ed Belfour (35-15-9, 1.99 GAA) and Roman Turek 
(16-3-3, 2.08 GAA) gave up only 168 goals in 82 games between them, 
giving Dallas the Jennings Trophy (fewest goals yielded) for the 
first time. Oilers finished season 5-0-1. Bill Guerin (30 goals, 64 
points) led the team in scoring, followed by Josef Beranek (49 
points). However, both are out with knee injuries and could be back 
in a week. Mike Grier set career highs with 20 goals and 44 points. 
Goalie Tommy Salo (25-28-9, 2.57 GAA) makes his first playoff 
appearance. Stars won't miss Hatcher in first round, especially if 
Beranek and Guerin don't play. Dallas in 4.

<P>
	1998-99 Series Record: Colorado 3-1-0.  
</P>
<P>
	Outlook: The Avalanche captured their fifth straight division  
title, finishing on a 9-2-1 clip and a 10-game home unbeaten streak 
(8-0-2). The Avalanche have three 90-point scorers -- Peter Forsberg 
(30 goals, 97 points), Joe Sakic (41 goals, 96 points) and 
trade-deadline acquisition Theo Fleury (40 goals, 93 points). Milan 
Hejduk (48 points) scored 18 points in his final 15 games to win 
the rookie scoring title by one point over New Jersey's Brendan 
Morrison. Claude Lemieux (51 points) is a perennial playoff 
standout. Forwards Adam Deadmarsh (blurred vision) and Valeri 
Kamensky (broken right forearm) are out indefinitely. Patrick Roy 
(44-28-10, 2.29 GAA) is the NHL's career leader in playoff wins 
with 99. Colorado had a 13-5 scoring edge in the season series. The 
Sharks closed out the season 1-3-1. Jeff Friesen (22 goals, 57 
points) led the team in scoring again, though Joe Murphy (25 goals) 
was the top goal scorer. Mike Vernon (16-22-10, 2.27 GAA) missed 
time with a groin injury, but will get the bulk of the time in 
goal. Steve Shields (15-11-8, 2.22 GAA) filled in capably in 
Vernon's absence, posting a 9-0-2 mark during a late-season 
stretch. Defenseman Gary Suter (torn tricep) is out, and Andrei 
Zyuzin -- who played in the last two games after returning from 
nearly a month-long unexplained absence -- will miss the first two 
games because of a suspension resulting from a slashing incident in 
the season finale. Colorado in 5.

<P>
	1998-99 Series Record: Detroit 3-1-0.  
</P>
<P>
	Outlook: The two-time defending Stanley Cup champion Red Wings  
struggled early in the season, but finished 9-2-1 after acquiring 
Chris Chelios, Ulf Samuelsson, Wendel Clark and Bill Ranford at the 
trade deadline. Scotty Bowman, the NHL's winningest playoff coach 
at 194-111, seeks to achieve his third straight Cup -- something no 
team has done since Al Arbour guided the Islanders to four straight 
from 1980-83. Red Wings were third in the league in offense with 
245 goals. Brendan Shanahan led the team with 31 goals; Steve 
Yzerman (29 goals, 74 points) was the leading scorer. Sergei 
Fedorov and Igor Larionov had 63 points apiece. Defenseman Uwe 
Krupp (back) is out indefinitely, while forward Joe Kocur (abdomen) 
is day-to-day. Chris Osgood (34-25-4, 2.42 GAA) is backed up by 
Ranford (6-18-4, 3.64 GAA), who went 3-0-1 with a 1.96 GAA in four 
starts after coming to Detroit. Anaheim closed out the season 1-5-1 
to fall into sixth place in the conference. The Mighty Ducks 
haven't had much success against the Red Wings, posting a 4-15-5 
overall record. Anaheim is 1-10-3 including playoffs at Joe Louis 
Arena. The Ducks have two of the NHL's most prolific scorers in 
Teemu Selanne (league-leading 47 goals and 107 points) and Paul 
Kariya (39 goals, 101 points). Kariya took 429 shots -- falling 
short of Phil Esposito's 550 in the 1970-71 season. Selanne also 
led the league with 25 power-play goals. Guy Hebert (31-29-9, 2.42 
GAA) had six shutouts. Detroit in 6.

</P>
<P>
	1998-99 Series Record: St. Louis 2-1-1.  
</P>
<P>
	Outlook: The Coyotes snapped a five-game losing streak in the  
season finale and reached the 90-point mark for only the second 
time in franchise history. Jeremy Roenick (broken jaw, broken 
thumb) is out for the playoffs, while defenseman Gerald Diduck 
(broken foot) could miss the first round. Defenseman Jyrki Lumme 
returned after missing 16 games with a shoulder injury, but then 
sat out the last two and is day-to-day. Left wing Keith Tkachuk (36 
goals, 68 points) has moved to center in place of Roenick (72 
points). Robert Reichel (69 points) and Rick Tocchet (56 points) 
had 26 goals apiece. Nikolai Khabibulin (32-23-7, 2.13 GAA) had 
eight shutouts. St. Louis closed out the season 6-1-2, passing 
Anaheim for the fifth spot. The Blues also won their last four road 
games. Geoff Courtnall is back in the Blues lineup after missing 
most of the season with post-concussion syndrome. Pavol Demitra led 
the Blues with 37 goals and 89 points, but had six goals disallowed 
-- four on video review and two on referee's decisions. Norris 
Trophy candidate Al MacInnis -- winner of the hardest-shot event at 
All-Star weekend -- led all defensemen with 20 goals and 42 assists. 
Grant Fuhr (16-11-8, 2.44 GAA) shares the goaltending duties with 
Jamie McLennan (13-14-4, 2.54 GAA). In the penultimate game for 
both teams, St. Louis scored five third-period goals to beat the 
Coyotes. St. Louis in 5.

<HEADLINE> Figures Show Taiwan Economy Rebound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Strong export orders and industrial  
production results for March seem to confirm government claims that 
Taiwan's economy stopped slowing after a tumultuous 1998 and is now 
set for further robust growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Export orders in March rose 3.6 percent compared with the same  
month last year to $10.6 billion, contributing to an overall 2.7 
percent rise in exports over the first quarter of 1999, the 
Economics Ministry said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	More good news seems likely, with exports in the April 1-17  
period up 4.9 percent on the year to $5.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade surplus, meanwhile, expanded to $483 million from $121  
million in the same period a year earlier, the Ministry of Finance 
reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports during the first part of March fell 2.2 percent to $4.9  
billion on year. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade figures point to a rebound in Taiwan's economy, which  
should allow the government to raise its forecast for 1999 economic 
growth next month, said Hsu Kuo-chung, the ministry's director of 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising growth seems certain as the third quarter is  
traditionally Taiwan's peak season for exports, Hsu said. 
</P>
<P>
	Total exports fell 9.4 percent last year, holding economic  
growth to just 4.8 percent, the lowest level since 1982. Export 
orders, which indicate export levels over the three months to come, 
dropped by 4 percent in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, industrial production rose 7.9 percent year-on-year  
in March, the ministry said, contributing to a 5.4 percent rise in 
the first three months of the year from the same period last year.

<HEADLINE> Bryan Adams Likes To Keep Young </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bryan Adams has always approached his career  
with a ``T-shirt and jeans sensibility,'' retaining a kinship with 
his audience. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think rock 'n' roll does keep you young,'' Adams said. ``I  
meet people from school all the time. The guy is bald, has a 
paunch, two kids and a wife. That could be me. He looks 50. We're 
38. I've managed to elude the paunch. I like to swim and ride a 
bicycle. When I come to New York, I have it sent here. That's how I 
travel in London, where I live, or I walk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adams has sold 55 million albums since he began recording nearly  
20 years ago. He has a big catalog of hits, including ``(Everything 
I Do) I Do It for You,'' ``All for Love'' with Sting and Rod 
Stewart, and ``Can't Stop This Thing We Started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Run to You'' and ``Summer of '69'' are from his ``teen idol''  
period. As he has matured, Adams has gone on to ``social 
conscious'' songs, using ``Tears Are Not Enough'' to raise $2.5 
million for the Northern Lights Society for African Relief. 
</P>
<P>
	His favorite recordings are the best sellers. ``They become  
favorites because they did so well,'' Adams said. ``I like the 
songs everyone else likes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not every song has been a hit. ``I Want To Be Your Underwear,''  
the single from his last album, ``was a stiff in sales,'' Adams 
said. ``It did nothing. I thought it had a sense of humor. It 
offended all sorts of people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's nothing remotely like it on his new 13-song CD, ``Bryan  
Adams: On a Day Like Today,'' released by A&AMP;M. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are various themes on this record -- freedom, trust,  
infidelity, immortality and love,'' the Canadian rocker said. 
``These themes occur in people's minds all the time. They have in 
mine. There are never any answers. You have to wander through the 
day and see what happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Writing about such topics is cathartic, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's also kind of an exorcism. You're able to get a lot of  
things out of your system you don't ordinarily say. Guys don't 
talk. Women love to talk. I know I've been able to get a lot of 
things out of my system just by writing them down. I think when you 
write things down, it's almost like therapy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One duet on the CD is a hurting song, ``When You're Gone,'' sung  
with Sporty Spice, who is billed as Melanie C. Another song, 
``Fearless,'' is about cheating. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked, ``How do you get through it and over it?'' Adams  
responded by repeating the question. ``I don't know. Not that I 
should. I'm just a musician.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adams has been praised and criticized as a writer of simple  
songs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It isn't an aim to write simple,'' he said. ``I wish I'd  
written 'Volare.' It's played every day in every Italian restaurant 
in the world. I'm basically caged by my abilities. I have no 
musical education. I fly by the seat of my pants. I've been taught 
by the people I've worked with. My whole career has been trial and 
error.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adams worked with Gretchen Peters, who writes country songs, for  
seven of the songs on the new CD. 
</P>
<P>
	``A song can start from a title or a groove. It doesn't matter  
where it comes from as long as you get there in the end,'' he said. 
``I've never tried to write complex songs. I don't know how to. I 
had complex chord structures in 'We're Going To Win.' It was 
uptempo and was difficult to sing and play. I never played it right 
once, live. The studio is more forgiving. You can make an error and 
fix it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But I'm getting to the point I'm not so precious about things  
as I used to be,'' he continued. ``After making 'Unplugged,' which 
took one and a half years, I thought, 'Why am I spending a year and 
a half in the studio? I'd rather be doing other things.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Adams has won many awards, the only two he displays are  
his Ivor Novello awards -- named for a Welsh actor-composer -- which 
he won for ``(Everything I Do) I Do It for You'' and ``Have You 
Ever Really Loved a Woman?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Does celebrity bring a certain visibility?  
</P>
<P>
	Not really.  
</P>
<P>
	When he walks around London and New York, ``I get spotted by  
doormen more than by anybody else. They say, `Hey, Bryan, what's 
happening?' or `Yo, Adams.'''

<HEADLINE>  NATO Seeks To Undermine Milosevic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After four weeks of gradually escalated  
airstrikes, NATO is moving from strictly military targets to ones 
aimed at undermining President Slobodan Milosevic's political 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	This was evident in NATO's attack Wednesday morning on a  
Belgrade building that housed the offices of Milosevic's ruling 
Socialist Party of Serbia, as well as transmitters for TV and radio 
stations owned by Milosevic's daughter, and other business and 
party offices of people close to Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	British Defense Secretary George Robertson called the Belgrade  
target a ``nerve center'' of Milosevic's power structure. ``We are 
now striking at the very heart of his bloodstained regime,'' 
Robertson said in London. 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-story building is just one example of NATO's intent to  
intensify pressure on Milosevic to accept the Western alliance's 
demands for an end to the violence in Kosovo and the safe return of 
ethnic Albanian refugees, alliance spokesman Jamie Shea said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shea said he thought the attack ``will have certainly been a  
powerful reminder to him of the fact that there is no sanctuary for 
any aspect of his power structure as long as he continues to defy 
the international community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is NATO's calculation that threatening Milosevic's  
instruments of power -- his political base, including control of 
Serb media -- is the best hope for breaching his threshold for pain 
and breaking his will to resist. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts disagree and fear this approach will backfire.  
</P>
<P>
	``If anything, it will only stiffen his resolve,'' Robert Gates,  
a former CIA director, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Daily bombing of military targets throughout Serbia since March  
24 so far has failed to end the repression of ethnic Albanians in 
the province or to produce signs that Milosevic will bend. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton presaged this latest move up NATO's list of  
strategic targets when he said last week that the air campaign was 
moving to the ``next level.'' He added, ``Ultimately, Mr. Milosevic 
will have to choose, either to cut his mounting losses or lose his 
ability to maintain his grip on Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Army Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,  
has been more explicit. 
</P>
<P>
	At a hearing Wednesday before the House Appropriations  
subcommittee on defense, he showed a color-coded chart depicting 
three phases of the air campaign, beginning with attacks on Serb 
air defenses that are meant to ``set conditions,'' or establish 
NATO's ability to conduct strikes when and where it desires. 
</P>
<P>
	The second phase, designed to isolate Serb military forces,  
targeted rail and road networks, fuel production and storage and 
facilities that enable Milosevic to command and communicate with 
his armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
	With those two goals partly accomplished, NATO's third phase is  
intended to ``decimate'' Milosevic's forces in Kosovo, Shelton 
said, and to break the back of his political support. 
</P>
<P>
	In his public remarks, Shelton said the targets in this third  
and final phase are classified secret. But other officials said the 
political party offices and broadcasting facilities hit Wednesday 
fall in this category. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied missiles Wednesday also hit a radio and TV transmission  
tower on Mount Fruska Gora outside Novi Sad, Serbia's 
second-largest city. NATO had struggled with an internal debate 
over whether to attack broadcasting facilities, which are not 
strictly a military target. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, the top NATO commander, apparently  
carried the day with his argument in favor of such strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Apache helicopters that began arriving in Albania on  
Wednesday are not intended for strategic targets, but they play an 
important role in tactical strikes on Milosevic's forces inside 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, the new focus on higher-value strategic targets and  
the addition of tank-killing Apache helicopters mark an 
intensification of military pressure NATO hopes to keep up for 
weeks or months. 
</P>
<P>
	As planned from the start of the air war, targets hit in the  
earliest stages remain under attack. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, NATO planes are far from finished attacking air  
defense sites such as surface-to-air missile batteries, radars and 
the communications facilities than enable the air defenses to 
operate together. Some of these have been hit, repaired by the 
Serbs and then attacked again. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, NATO is keeping up its assault on fuel, ammunition and  
other supply lines into Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> INS, Customs Chiefs Deny Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. customs and immigration agencies have  
tightened internal controls, their chiefs told a Senate panel 
Wednesday, but they denied any widespread corruption among federal 
agents who police the Southwest border. 
</P>
<P>
	The two agency chiefs were summoned before the Senate Caucus on  
International Narcotics Control to discuss a recent General 
Accounting Office conclusion that drug traffickers' bribes 
represent a ``serious and continuing threat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Customs Service and the Immigration and Naturalization  
Service intercepted more than 2 million pounds of marijuana, 
cocaine and other illegal drugs last year. Most of the 
multibillion-dollar drug inflow into the United States occurs at 
the Southwest border. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lure of huge profits generated by drug trafficking is  
undeniably strong, especially for people of modest means who can 
earn a year's pay in one afternoon simply by looking the other 
way,'' INS Commissioner Doris Meissner said, calling corruption an 
``ever-present threat'' for her agency. 
</P>
<P>
	GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, concluded in a report  
last month that Customs and INS could do more to deter and root out 
corruption among their rank-and-file. 
</P>
<P>
	While both agencies are diligent in conducting background  
investigations for new hires, GAO faulted them for falling behind 
in conducting the reinvestigations required for staffers who have 
been on the job for five years. GAO also said both agencies are 
missing opportunities to examine past episodes of corruption to 
learn ways of deterring future incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Customs Commissioner Raymond Kelly said his agency is in the  
midst of a major reorganization of its internal affairs division 
and has taken other steps to reduce corruption, including setting 
up a toll-free hotline for whistleblowers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every review of Customs to date ... has concluded that no  
systemic corruption exists at the agency,'' Kelly said. ``Still, as 
the GAO rightly pointed out, there are some things we can do 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Kelly said the rate of corruption within Customs is  
relatively low, he added, ``We have to be much more active in 
ferreting it out on our own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meissner defended INS' internal controls as effective and showed  
little enthusiasm for GAO's recommendation that her agency 
institute financial reporting requirements for its employees. 
Customs already requires financial disclosures. 
</P>
<P>
	But GAO Associate Director Richard Stana told the caucus that  
financial disclosures by Border Patrol agents and INS inspectors 
could turn up potential problems. Of the 28 INS and Customs 
employees convicted of drug-related crimes in a six-year period 
examined by GAO, six either were in debt or living beyond their 
means, Stana said. 
</P>
<P>
	In one instance, a mid-level Border Patrol agent owned a  
$200,000 home with a five-car garage, an Olympic-size pool housed 
in its own building, $45,000 in Treasury bills, 40 acres of land, 
six vehicles, two boats and 100 weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's vital that we develop tighter controls,'' said Sen.  
Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. ``I am really worried about the spread 
of corruption north of the border.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meissner said INS already tracks credit reports and talks to  
neighbors and friends about employees' financial means during 
background investigations. Feinstein warned that she will introduce 
legislation mandating financial disclosures every three years 
unless INS moves forward on its own. 
</P>
<P>
	``The money that comes out of the (drug) cartels is just too big  
for many people to withstand,'' Feinstein said.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Party Urges Ocalan Execution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Turkey's far-right party, a key winner in  
national elections, will push for the death penalty against Kurdish 
rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan if he is convicted, a spokesman said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nationalist Movement Party, or MHP, emerged as Turkey's  
second-largest party after Sunday's elections and is expected to be 
part of a future coalition government headed by Prime Minister 
Bulent Ecevit. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan was abducted by Turkish commandos in mid-February and  
faces trial on charges of treason, which carries the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the court sentences him to death, we will vote to see him  
hanged,'' said Ata Turkoglu, an MHP spokesman. ``We want this to 
happen as soon as possible after the verdict.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A state security court in Ankara will hold a hearing on April 30  
and is expected to merge almost half a dozen cases that are pending 
against Ocalan. A trial date will be set after that hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	It is widely expected in Turkey that Ocalan will be convicted,  
but a death sentence must be approved by parliament. Parliament has 
not approved a death sentence since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	The far-right's sharp gains in the elections and the MHP's  
uncompromising opposition toward Kurdish activists are expected to 
increase chances that Ocalan will be executed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is much easier for the death penalty to be approved now,''  
said one of Ocalan's lawyers, Ahmet Zeki Ockuoglu. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan himself expressed surprise when told by his lawyers of  
the MHP's stunning gains, said Mahmut Sakar, a lawyer with Ocalan's 
defense team. In the last elections, the party failed to cross the 
10 percent threshold necessary to win seats in parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanging the rebel leader is expected to strain relations with  
the European Union, where the death penalty has been abolished in 
all 15 member states. Italy on Tuesday urged Turkey not to execute 
Ocalan. 
</P>
<P>
	In another important case, an appeals court has upheld a second  
one-year prison sentence for a leading human rights activist, his 
group said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Akin Birdal, head of the Human Rights Association, had been  
convicted on charges of inciting racial hatred for a speech he made 
three years ago in which he called for a peaceful solution to 15 
years of fighting between Kurdish rebels and the Turkish army in 
Turkey's southeast. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the appeals court upheld another one-year sentence  
against Birdal for inciting racial hatred in a speech he made two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Birdal is scheduled to go to jail on May 3.  
</P>
<P>
	He has campaigned against torture and the army's forced  
evacuation of thousands of Kurdish villages in the southeast.

<HEADLINE> Families Mourn Shooting Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- John Robert Tomlin appeared to have life  
figured out at age 16. The sophomore was a focused but cheerful 
youth who managed to mix teen-age fun with a mature sense of 
purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	Then his high school erupted into a killing field.  
</P>
<P>
	Tomlin was one of 12 Columbine High School students who were  
killed Tuesday by a pair of outcast schoolmates heavily armed with 
guns, bombs and grievances. A popular teacher also was slain in the 
worst school massacre in U.S. history before the shooters committed 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said they planned to release the names of all the  
victims today. But Tomlin's and other deaths were confirmed 
Wednesday by family members. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomlin liked to go four-wheeling in his beat-up Chevy pickup  
down rollercoaster dirt roads in the nearby Rocky Mountains. But he 
also worked after-school at a local nursery and belonged to a 
church youth group. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, he went on a missionary trip to Mexico with family  
and built a house for poor people. Two years from now, Tomlin 
planned to enlist in the Army. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a great kid, really happy, going to school, getting  
good grades,'' said his father, John Tomlin. ``He knew what he 
wanted to do. He had everything planned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the victims were shot in the second-floor library as  
they hid or begged for their lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Isaiah Shoels was shot in the head because he was black and  
athletic, two things that the gunmen proclaimed they despised. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoels, 18, was described as a mere 5-foot-4, but a weightlifter  
who played football. He dreamed of becoming a music executive. 
</P>
<P>
	His executioners -- classmates Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold --  
stood in an acrid cloud of gun smoke and marveled at their grisly 
handiwork. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh my God. Look at this black kid's brain. Awesome, man!'' the  
killers said, according to witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said they didn't like niggers,'' sophomore Evan Todd, 15,  
told reporters after escaping the library. ``So they shot him in 
the face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although witnesses said the killers were gunning for minorities,  
District Attorney Dave Thomas said there was no evidence to support 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've only seen the photographs, but it appears to me that most  
of the victims were victims because of where they were at a 
particular time, not that they were sought out,'' Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	The only adult among the victims was William ``Dave'' Sanders,  
47, a computer teacher and coach of the girl's basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
	Students said Sanders, a grandfather of five, had been shot  
twice in the chest but managed to shepherd students down a hallway 
and away from danger. He stumbled into a science class, bleeding 
profusely and coughing blood. 
</P>
<P>
	For the next three hours, students covered him with their shirts  
and an emergency blanket they found in a first aid kit, and they 
kept talking to him in hopes he would rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Students said he grew cold and repeated, ``I'm not going to make  
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Paul Cercle, a minister from Rochester, Ind., said his  
granddaughter, Rachel Scott, 17, was killed, probably in the 
cafeteria as students stampeded towards the exits. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a purely random shot,'' Cercle said. ``It would have to  
be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rachel's stepbrother, Craig Scott, 16, was in the library and  
survived the massacre only because he played dead in a friend's 
pool of blood. He later helped lead blood-spattered and frightened 
classmates to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	A parent, Neal DePooter, confirmed that his son, Corey DePooter,  
17, was killed, but declined further comment. And KCNC-TV in Denver 
reported that Lauren Townsend, 18, was among the victims. She 
played on the volleyball team. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents of other victims huddled by their telephones Wednesday  
and held vigil at private shelters after gathering dental records 
and providing authorities with descriptions of their children's 
clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel there were more (people) responsible than the two  
parties in the school,'' said Shoels' father, Michael Shoels. ``The 
thing that happened could have been avoided. Someone had to know.''

<P>
	A reconstruction of Tuesday's school shooting in Littleton,  
Colo. All times MDT: 
</P>
<P>
	11 a.m. -- About 900 Columbine High School students head into the  
cafeteria for lunch, hit the books in the library or in classrooms. 

</P>
<P>
	11:30 a.m. -- Two young men wearing long black trench coats  
approach the school. They pull out weapons and open fire in the 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
	They proceed inside, to the school cafeteria, shooting as they  
walk, then upstairs to the library, still shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	As bullets ricochet throughout the building, scores of students  
hide in closets, bathrooms, under tables and chairs. Some students, 
barricaded behind a heavy door, whisper of their terror over 
cell-phone calls to relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens more flee the building, hiding in bushes or sprinting to

<HEADLINE> Actor Charles 'Buddy' Rogers Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. (AP) -- Actor and bandleader Charles  
``Buddy'' Rogers, star of the first film to win the best-picture 
Oscar who was married to screen legend Mary Pickford, died 
Wednesday at his home. He was 94. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers was a student at the University of Kansas when his father  
persuaded him to send in his photo to a Paramount Pictures talent 
hunt. He made his screen debut in 1926 with Paramount's 
``Fascinating Youth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A year later, as the silent-movie era waned, Rogers starred in  
``Wings,'' playing a small-town boy who becomes a World War I pilot 
only to accidentally shoot down his best friend. The film took 
Hollywood's top honor at the first Academy Awards ceremony in May 
1929. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers married Miss Pickford after her marriage to fellow  
superstar Douglas Fairbanks fell apart in the 1930s. He was married 
to her from 1936 until her death in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	While his wife's celebrity surpassed his own, Rogers had roles  
in films such as ``Young Eagles,'' ``This Way Please'' and 
``Mexican Spitfire's Baby,'' earning the nickname ``America's 
Boyfriend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Pickford ended her film career after only a handful of  
talking films, but Rogers remained active on screen through the 
'30s and early '40s. 
</P>
<P>
	After television arrived, he became a regular on the ``Cavalcade  
of Bands'' on the Dumont network in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers, who remarried in 1980, is survived by his wife, Beverly.

<HEADLINE> Reggie White Calls Media Demonic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Former Green Bay Packers star Reggie White,  
who earlier this month wrote an opinion piece for The Wall Street 
Journal, has condemned the media as a tool of the devil. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at a fund-raiser for a Christian pregnancy counseling  
organization, White said the media -- from newspapers to movies -- 
are used by the devil to shape the thoughts of young people. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stop believing what you read in the newspapers,'' White said  
Tuesday. ``Stop believing what you see on TV. Find out the truth 
before you make a judgment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his piece for the Journal, White spoke out against allowing  
reporters of the opposite sex into professional athletes' locker 
rooms. The issue was not raised Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	White, an ordained minister, has been criticized for his  
opinions since his speech last year to the Wisconsin Legislature in 
which he attacked homosexuality and used racial stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
	White, 37, retired from the National Football League this year  
after 14 seasons.

<HEADLINE> A Look at the 'Trenchcoat Mafia' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris hurled  
insults at Jews, blacks and Hispanics at Columbine High School. But 
they REALLY hated the athletes, who had power and popularity -- 
everything they didn't. 
</P>
<P>
	``All jocks stand up!'' one of the attackers yelled during their  
murderous spree Tuesday. ``We're going to kill every one of you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They killed 13 people in the deadliest school massacre in recent  
years. Then Klebold and Harris turned their guns on themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	A horrible as their assault on classmates was, it did not come  
out of the blue: Klebold, Harris and others in a band of outcasts 
who called themselves the Trenchcoat Mafia had a long-running feud 
with Columbine athletes, including a recent confrontation in which 
the ``mafioso'' showed up carrying swords and brass knuckles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Trenchcoat Mafia was no secret society. Members posed for a  
yearbook photo last year. They had their own special spot in the 
cafeteria, near the stairs. They wore black trench coats -- no 
matter the season -- and berets with Nazi crosses. They openly 
admired Hitler. They spoke constantly of war and guns, and Harris 
had made a video at school in which he bragged about his new guns. 
</P>
<P>
	After Paducah and Edinboro, Jonesboro and Springfield, how could  
such provocative behavior not raise alarm? 
</P>
<P>
	Rather easily, it turns out.  
</P>
<P>
	If fellow students at Columbine were concerned -- and some now  
say they were -- they said little to adults, figuring they could 
handle these troublesome misfits themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	If teachers and police noticed, they passed it off as teen-age  
rebellion, unpopular kids looking for a sense of belonging. 
</P>
<P>
	And if parents like Steve Cohn worried about their children's  
safety, they rested easy knowing that Columbine High was the nicest 
of schools in the nicest of areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We moved here 11 years ago because of the schools,'' Cohn  
said. ``It's been a great neighborhood. Until now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohn's son, Aaron, 15, narrowly escaped execution Tuesday. Lying  
on his stomach in the library, Aaron cowered as one of the masked 
gunmen leveled a shotgun at his head. A few moments earlier, a girl 
had jumped on Cohn's back, covering the baseball slogan on his 
shirt. The gunman moved on and chose another victim. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	A few weeks ago, the big news at Columbine High was pranksters  
putting Superglue in all the outside door locks. 
</P>
<P>
	Most cliques here would be familiar on any U.S. high school  
campus: band kids, nerds, stoners, skateboarders and, at the top of 
the pecking order, athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Harder to label were the dozen members of the Trenchcoat Mafia.  
Some fellow students described them as resembling ``Gothics,'' 
sharing a penchant for black clothes and ghoulish makeup. Their 
long black dusters fit the Gothic style, but also that of Old West 
villains. Members of the group simply said the coats kept them 
warm. 
</P>
<P>
	Their interest in Hitler and World War II was well-known around  
school. They played war games and bragged about their guns. Harris 
and Klebold sometimes spoke German in the hallways and made 
references to ``4-20,'' Hitler's birthday, said Aaron Cohn, who 
lives five doors down from the tidy, two-story home on a quiet 
cul-de-sac where Harris' family moved in a couple years ago. The 
massacre took place on Hitler's birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohn said Harris, 18, was nonetheless a quiet kid who hadn't  
caused him any problems in the past. Other neighbors echoed that. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a nice guy,'' said Matt Good, 16, who lives two doors  
away. ``Shy person, didn't say much. I'd see him walk from the car 
to the house, and that's about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris' parents were nowhere in sight this week as reporters  
streamed past their home. Neighbors said they didn't know much 
about the family, except that the father was a retired military 
man. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris and Klebold were arrested last year for breaking into a  
car and completed their probation in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Klebold, 17, and other Trenchcoats had reputations for being  
smart and skilled at computers. Choir teacher Lee Andres remembers 
the 6-foot-4, blond Klebold as a smart kid. He ran the sound for 
one of last year's school musicals. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were extremely bright, but not good students,'' Andres  
told the Denver Rocky Mountain News. ``They disliked authority. 
They did not like to be told what to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By all accounts, they held a special hatred for athletes -- a  
contempt returned in good measure. John Duven said his teen-age 
son, a jock, almost got into a fight with them last year, but Duven 
talked him out of it. 
</P>
<P>
	The hostilities resurfaced this year.  
</P>
<P>
	``A couple of months ago, the jocks were supposed to fight  
them,'' said Good, a football player. They made a date to rumble: a 
Friday night at a baseball field. The jocks showed up, but the 
Trenchcoats were two hours late, and they went to the wrong spot, 
Good said. They also showed up carrying swords and brass knuckles -- 
not the jocks' idea of a clean fight. The rumble was never 
rescheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	``The jocks said forget it,'' Good said.  
</P>
<P>
	School officials said they'd had no discipline problems with  
Klebold or Harris, and they passed under the radar of the Jefferson 
County Sheriff's Department, said spokesman Steve Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	After the shooting, investigators questioned other members, but  
Davis said there was no indication other members took part in the 
actual shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Cohn finds it hard to believe that school authorities or  
police didn't notice the group. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wasn't it obvious, to someone?'' he asked. ``All the kids knew  
about it. You'd think a teacher would notice. You'd think the 
sheriff's department would know.''

<HEADLINE> Hank Aaron Reigns as Career HR King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With the death last month of Joe DiMaggio, a  
recent poll chose Willie Mays as the greatest living ball player. 
Hank Aaron, who hit almost 400 more home runs than DiMaggio and 95 
more than Mays, has no problem with that. 
</P>
<P>
	``They voted DiMaggio the greatest,'' Aaron said. ``That's fine.  
Now it's Willie. That's fine, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's Aaron's style. He is at peace with himself, content that  
his performance, including the record 755 home runs and the record 
2,297 RBIs, speaks for itself. 
</P>
<P>
	He never had more than 47 home runs in a season, almost ordinary  
compared to Mark McGwire's 70 and Sammy Sosa's 66 last summer. But 
he reached 40 homers eight times and was in the 30s seven times. 
</P>
<P>
	He never drove in more than 132 runs in a season, far from Hack  
Wilson's record 190 and Lou Gehrig's 184. But he had 11 seasons of 
100 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did what I did,'' Aaron said. ``What I loved about what I  
did was the consistency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And consistency, he said, is what it will take to break the home  
run mark, celebrated more now than it ever was 25 years ago, when 
he broke Babe Ruth's mark of 714. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron has become a hot item.  
</P>
<P>
	There's a new award carrying his name that will go to baseball's  
best hitter and a slick new photo book published by Total Sports 
reflecting on his life and his achievement. President Clinton 
attended his 65th birthday party and invited him to visit the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it was the McGwire-Sosa home run chase that reminded fans  
about the exclamation point a home run provides. Aaron was the No. 
1 practitioner of baseball's slam dunk. 
</P>
<P>
	But he doesn't make a big deal over all those long balls he hit  
so long ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was able to do some things I'm proud of,'' he said. ``I was  
able to score a lot of runs. I never struck out 100 times in a 
season. One thing I did was hit 755 home runs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It stands alone as baseball's most glamorous record, eloquent  
testimony to a career of year-in, year-out excellence. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron believes the best chance of challenging the record belongs  
to Ken Griffey Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's 29 and he has 350,'' Aaron said. ``If he keeps doing what  
he's doing, he can break it. It will take a ballplayer an awful 
long time having good years to hit 755. I played a long time. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some ways, he's the same way I was, playing in a small  
city. Last year, not many people know he hit more than 50 homers. 
He's done that two or three years now. It's a question of whether 
he stays focused or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was not a particular challenge for Aaron.  
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't hard for me,'' he said. ``Each night I went home and  
looked at a table with three kids to feed. That kept me focused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the McGwire-Sosa chase to break Roger Maris' record of 61  
home runs, there was no festive side to Aaron's pursuit of the home 
run record. His run at Ruth was tinged with ugly racial overtones 
and, in the end, it was less celebrated than it was acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
	Number 715 was accompanied by relief rather than joy about the  
achievement. The scars of that time are buried in the deepest part 
of his psyche now, overshadowed by the good times he now enjoys. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, though, he remembers.  
</P>
<P>
	``McGwire, every time he hit a homer, he raised his son,'' he  
said, recalling the home plate greeting that became a ritual 
between father and son. ``I was unable to do that. If I had, how 
wonderful it would have been.''

<HEADLINE> Rockies, Nuggets Mourn Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Members of the Denver Nuggets walked through the  
hallway at McNichols Arena, their faces a reflection of disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
	A few miles away at Coors Field, baseball players gathered  
silently in the clubhouse, trying to comprehend the deadly events 
unfolding on the big-screen television before them. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a shock,'' Nuggets forward Eric Williams said after  
Denver's game against the Portland Trail Blazers was postponed 
after as many as 15 people were killed Tuesday at a suburban high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where can your kids be safe? On the streets?'' Williams said.  
``I feel for those families. You send your kids away to school this 
morning on a peaceful note and come home to something tragic like 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting at Columbine High School in suburban Littleton also  
prompted the Colorado Rockies to postpone their game against the 
Montreal Expos. The game will be rescheduled as part of an August 
doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't have played,'' Expos third baseman Shane Andrews  
said. ``I had a hard time just being on the field. Thinking about 
it makes me sick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rockies owner Jerry McMorris talked to baseball commissioner Bud  
Selig before deciding to postpone the game as horrifying details 
emerged about the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so sick,'' Nuggets general manager Dan Issel said. ``You  
just wonder what's happening in our world. I guess the scary thing 
is it could happen anywhere, it could happen anywhere at any time. 
We don't know how our world got to this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Issel promised that the Nuggets and Avalanche Community Fund  
``will do something financially for those victims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was little anyone could do immediately Tuesday but reflect  
upon a disturbing trend throughout America. Since 1997, 12 students 
have been killed in shootings at schools in Mississippi, Kentucky, 
Arkansas and Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can happen to anyone,'' said Colorado pitcher Brian  
Bohanon, who has five children. ``The way things are going 
nowadays, it's popping up all over the country. It's a tragedy. 
They're just kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You start thinking about life,'' Rockies first baseman Todd  
Helton said. ``Players in here are sort of in our own little world, 
and this sort of opens your eyes a little bit to how important life 
is and how important kids are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montreal manager Felipe Alou, who managed the Triple-A Denver  
Bears in 1981, has had plenty of sobering reminders. He was with 
the Expos when National League umpire John McSherry collapsed and 
died of a heart attack in the first inning of Montreal's 1996 
season opener in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how many people care if we are playing,'' Alou  
said. ``I remember that day in Cincinnati. The whole team died with 
one man dying. ... We can't play. We can't even play cards 
tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bohanon (2-0), Tuesday's scheduled starter for Colorado will  
pitch today. Montreal will skip Mike Thurman (0-1) in the rotation 
and stick with today's scheduled starter, Dustin Hermanson (2-0). 
</P>
<P>
	``There was never a discussion about the game, the team, the  
pitching,'' Rockies general manager Bob Gebhard said. ``This is a 
lot more important to everybody in this community than the starting 
rotation.''

<HEADLINE> School Shooting Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Gov. Jesse Ventura said Wednesday the  
Colorado school shooting demonstrates the need for loosening 
restrictions on concealed weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Had there been someone who was armed, in this particular  
situation, in my opinion, it may have stabilized,'' the former 
professional wrestler-turned politician said. ``I believe it 
supports conceal and carry because of the fact that what happens 
when a group of unarmed individuals are confronted with people with 
weapons like this, you have no defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura obtained a permit to carry a concealed weapon after he  
was inaugurated in January. 
</P>
<P>
	He supports loosening handgun permit rules for non-criminals who  
complete gun-safety training and skills testing. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The school shooting was front page news in most  
American newspapers, but not the Chicago Sun Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Editors believed the carnage that swept through a Colorado high  
school was too violent for page one. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerned about the possibility that such prominent display  
``could harm or frighten vulnerable children,'' the Sun-Times 
spread the story across pages two, three and four. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see a danger that publicity surrounding such attacks could  
be contributing to the phenomenon,'' the paper added in a 
three-paragraph, page-one note to readers explaining its decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Editor in Chief Nigel Wade said the decision provided at least a  
measure of protection for youngsters who could be shaken by the 
story. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not leaving anything out, but we're putting the story  
where adults will find it,'' Wade said. ``We're also giving parents 
a chance to decide whether their children will see it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time that the Sun-Times decided to play school  
violence inside rather than on the front page. The first came after 
a May 21, 1998, shooting in Springfield, Ore., in which two 
teen-agers were shot to death and more than 20 people hurt. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- National Rifle Association president Charlton  
Heston said there should be armed guards in the nation's schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there had been even one armed guard in the school, he could  
have saved a lot of lives and perhaps ended the whole thing 
instantly,'' the actor told ABC News Wednesday after the Colorado 
school shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, Colorado's Jefferson County did have an armed deputy  
at Columbine High School. The deputy exchanged fire with the gunmen 
and called for backup. 
</P>
<P>
	Heston also said the shooters, believed to be part of a group  
dubbed the Trenchcoat Mafia, should not have been allowed to wear 
black coats to school. 
</P>
<P>
	``Come on. That's outrageous in a school,'' Heston said. ``I'm  
afraid you have to blame the parents of those two boys.''

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The two gunmen in the Colorado school rampage  
were influenced by hate-preaching Web sites that have multiplied as 
the Internet continues to flourish, Simon Wiesenthal Center 
officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet providers that are allowing this stuff to go  
online may want to reconsider whether they want to take a check 
from these individuals, whether they're anarchists, terrorists, 
neo-Nazis or just confused children,'' said Rabbi Abraham Cooper, 
associate dean of the center. 
</P>
<P>
	The center's founder and dean, Rabbi Marvin Hier, called on  
President Clinton to institute a tolerance and sensitivity 
curriculum in every school in the country. ``We need more than 
better security and counseling,'' Hier told reporters at a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys, who were apparently Internet enthusiasts, could have  
easily accessed instructions on how to make bombs using links from 
Internet sites posted by hate groups, Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gunman Eric Harris appears to have had an America Online Web  
site filled with apocalyptic imagery and apparent bomb diagrams.

	DENVER (AP) -- Following the deadly high school shootings in  
Littleton, two state legislative leaders said they would withdraw 
their gun bills for the 1999 session. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pulling it,'' said House Majority Leader Doug Dean, a  
Republican, said of his bill to simplify the issuance of permits 
for concealed weapons. The measure had caused long debates in 
several committees and on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Gary McPherson, another Republican and the sponsor of a  
bill to let a state law override local ordinances on gun control, 
also said he is asking that the bill be set aside.

<HEADLINE> Expos' Alou Outpours Sympathy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Montreal manager Felipe Alou agreed with the  
decision to postpone his team's game against Colorado for the 
second straight day because of the shooting at a Denver-area high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't cancel games, but I happen to agree with calling the  
game off,'' Alou said Wednesday. ``We aren't in Chicago or Miami or 
Los Angeles. We are right next door to where this thing happened 
and where there are still bodies inside the school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have respect for the children that are dead and the children  
that are alive,'' Alou said. ``If I were in charge, I wouldn't have 
played the game either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alou recalled his playing days, when Martin Luther King and  
Robert Kennedy were assassinated. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't play three days when I was a player with the Braves  
in 1968 and we were in Chicago,'' Alou said. ``I know Senator 
Kennedy was a great American, but he was one man. What have they 
found, 13 or so dead? And right here in town. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senator Kennedy was assassinated in LA and an entire league  
didn't play for three days,'' Alou said. ``When Martin Luther King 
was assassinated, we didn't play for a number of days, and that was 
at the beginning of the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Montreal returns to Coors Field on Aug. 13-15, the Expos  
will play a pair of day-night doubleheaders, creating a five-game 
series. The exact dates of the doubleheaders haven't been set. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it will cause some inconvenience having to play two  
doubleheaders in August and we might be rusty. but it is more 
important that we put some time between us and this incident.'' 
Alou said. ``Putting this off is more important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alou, who managed at Denver in 1981 when it had a Triple-A team,  
at first scheduled a full workout Wednesday at Coots Field, then 
made it optional. A handful of players got their running in. 
</P>
<P>
	``I picked the minds of some players and they said they'd rather  
go home,'' Alou said. ``We go home, and now this will look far 
behind us. Being a few thousand miles away will help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies open a four-game series at San Francisco on  
Thursday. Team officials announced the players and coaches would 
wear a Columbine High School patch on their right sleeves for the 
remainder of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pitching more than anything will be affected by all these lost  
games,'' said Colorado manager Jim Leyland, whose club lost four 
games of the nine-game homestand, two each to snow and the 
shooting. ``Hopefully, we will get in a groove on this road trip, 
when we are playing on a consistent basis.''

<HEADLINE> NHL May Back Lemieux Ownership Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The NHL may be about to exert the greatest  
possible influence to bring Mario Lemieux into its ownership ranks: 
No Mario, no Pittsburgh Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL plans to file legal documents Friday supporting the  
Lemieux group and offering to work with him to get the Penguins out 
of bankruptcy, league and legal sources close to the proceedings 
told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The league wants the matter settled by June at the latest, they  
said, so the Penguins can sell tickets and the NHL can set a 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people could buy the Penguins, but one person can  
save them: Mario Lemieux,'' Penguins spokesman Tom McMillan said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The league is discouraging Florida investment banker Chip Gesner  
from submitting a bid, one that might further slow the process, the 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Bernard Markovitz has scheduled a  
hearing on Lemieux's takeover bid for April 30. Markovitz has no 
obligation to follow the NHL's advice and choose the Lemieux group, 
but the league does have some leverage. 
</P>
<P>
	If the NHL does not agree with the choice of owners, it could  
reject the judge's recommendation and revoke the franchise, 
essentially making it worthless. 
</P>
<P>
	William Daly, the NHL's vice president for legal affairs, said  
the revocation of the franchise is an unwanted but valid way for 
the league to settle the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the NHL constitution, the Penguins' players then could be  
distributed throughout the league or the franchise could be awarded 
to a new city. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL has not set a firm date to resolve the Penguins'  
situation, but the next step could be to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything that sets a deadline ... is positive to keeping the  
Penguins in Pittsburgh,'' McMillan said. ``We've been in bankruptcy 
since October, and time is of the essence. In the NHL, next season 
begins in June. We have to make decisions about payroll and the 
budget and about signing players. And we've got to sell tickets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since Lemieux retired after the 1996-97 season and the Penguins'  
financial situation worsened, the team's season-ticket base has 
dropped from 12,000 to 8,300. By contrast, expansion franchises 
must guarantee season-ticket sales of 12,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't have another disastrous season ticket-selling  
season,'' McMillan said. ``If Mario's group gets in there, there 
are a lot of things that could be done right away to sell 
tickets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest hangup to reorganizing the Penguins' finances is the  
lack of a new lease with Spectacor Management Group, which operates 
the Civic Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite playing in the NHL's oldest arena, the Penguins' pay the  
steepest annual rent, an estimated $6 million to $7 million that is 
blamed for much of the team's financial problems. The lease was 
renegotiated several times under co-owner Howard Baldwin to supply 
cash needed to keep the team going. 
</P>
<P>
	Privately, the Lemieux group is hopeful that the threat of the  
Penguins folding or being relocated will be enough to spur city and 
county officials into pressuring SMG to renegotiate. However, 
lawyers for Lemieux and co-owner Roger Marino said the lease talks 
have gone nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless, Lemieux remains optimistic he will become the first  
former player in the history of modern major pro sports in the 
United States to buy his former team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand that Wayne (Gretzky) might want to someday,''  
Lemieux said. ``Maybe we could go at it someday as owners the way 
we did as players.''

<HEADLINE> The Price of the American Dream </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Buying into the American Dream has a price,  
especially when the cost is measured in terms of who wins and who 
loses. 
</P>
<P>
	Sports metaphors abound in ``That Championship Season,'' Jason  
Miller's still potent drama about a 20th-anniversary reunion of 
high school basketball champions. 
</P>
<P>
	A recipient of the Pulitzer Prize and a Broadway success in  
1972, ``That Championship Season'' is an old-fashioned play, 
realistic and talky. Yet it is highly effective, particularly when 
cast with five actors who can handle its frequent dramatic 
explosions. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortunately, off-Broadway's Second Stage, now in its handsome  
new theater constructed inside an old bank on Eighth Avenue and 
43rd Street, has found a quintet of fine performers who fill the 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief among them is James Gammon, a veteran of Sam Shepard plays  
in which he usually portrays grizzled crazies. Here, he plays the 
Coach, a man who lives by rules that no longer apply, if they ever 
did. A rigid, didactic, even bigoted individual, the Coach believes 
in winning as the standard by which all should be judged. Capturing 
the Pennsylvania high school basketball championship in 1952 
defined his career -- and his life. 
</P>
<P>
	Gammon brings this uncompromising man to life. He growls around  
the living room of the Coach's old house in a coal-mining town in 
northeastern Pennsylvania. His boys, despite their winning ways two 
decades earlier, now are having doubts about their later 
accomplishments in life. 
</P>
<P>
	They are a microcosm of types, yet Miller manages to flesh them  
out, making them into credible people overwhelmed by mid-life 
crises. One (Ray Baker) is the mayor, sensitive but a bit of a 
boob. His reelection is threatened by an aggressive challenger who 
plans to expose the man's predilection for patronage. Another 
(Dennis Boutsikaris) is a successful businessman, the area's 
strip-mine king, whose contributions to the mayor have helped 
deflect attacks on his polluting of the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	A third (Dylan Baker) is a teacher, a frustrated, angry man who  
always has done the right thing. Whether looking after his wife and 
kids or rescuing his alcoholic brother after yet another fall from 
the wagon, he has put duty above self for too long a time. 
</P>
<P>
	The alcoholic brother (Michael O'Keefe) also played on the  
fabled basketball squad. Despite living in a boozy haze, he is the 
one member of the team who remembers things clearly -- and wonders 
why Martin, the fifth player, has never shown up for any of their 
reunions. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Keefe does something special with a character who could be  
just a stereotype. The actor makes the man all the more 
heartbreaking, conveying the fact that the guy knows he hasn't 
lived up to his considerable potential. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, it is their youthful success that binds these  
troubled guys together. Their shining silver trophy, sitting in the 
Coach's living room, reminds them of what they once were. The Coach 
laments the loss of leaders, men he admired such as Gen. George 
Patton, President Kennedy and Sen. Joseph McCarthy. Since then, 
there have been no heroes. 
</P>
<P>
	Director Scott Ellis handles the multitude of regrets and  
recriminations with considerable skill, never letting the evening 
become shrill or overly argumentative. 
</P>
<P>
	But then, despite its toughness, Miller's play is surprisingly  
reflective. More than a quarter-century after it was written, 
``That Championship Season'' remains a strong piece of theater, a 
rueful reminder that early glory doesn't automatically guarantee 
future success.

<HEADLINE> Marrow May Reduce Organ Rejection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chance of a transplanted organ being  
rejected can be reduced sharply if the patient also is given bone 
marrow from the same donor, doctors at a leading transplant center 
have found. 
</P>
<P>
	Immune cells from the donor seem to condition the recipient's  
system not to attack the new organ, Dr. Abdul Rao of the University 
of Pittsburgh reports in a paper delivered Wednesday at a biology 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the effect was most dramatic in recipients of new hearts  
and lungs. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, incidents of acute rejection of new hearts occurred  
in 38 percent of cases when marrow also was transplanted, compared 
with 82 percent of cases without marrow. 
</P>
<P>
	In lung transplants, where long-term chronic rejection is a  
problem, Rao said just 4.7 percent of patients who also received 
bone marrow showed signs of rejection, compared with 31 percent of 
those without marrow. 
</P>
<P>
	Even acute rejection episodes do not necessarily mean the new  
organ has to be removed, Rao explained. But they do damage the 
organ and require strong doses of drugs to suppress the recipients 
immune system. Those drugs can leave the patient vulnerable to 
other infections. 
</P>
<P>
	Rao and his colleagues at the Thomas E. Starzl Transplantation  
Institute studied 269 patients who received bone marrow along with 
transplants of various organs, including livers, pancreases, 
kidneys, intestines, hearts and lungs. The results were compared 
with 131 patients who received transplants without bone marrow. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea for using marrow stemmed from studies of people who had  
long-term success after receiving liver transplants, allowing 
doctors substantially to reduce the dosages of immune-suppressing 
drugs, he said. Those people tended to have at least some donor 
immune cells in their bodies, which arrived along with the liver, 
even years after the transplant, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The coexistence of donor and recipient immune cells, called  
chimerism, is thought to be essential to long-term transplant 
success, Rao said. 
</P>
<P>
	By reducing the likelihood of the body trying to reject the new  
organ, those cells allow doctors to limit the amount of 
immune-suppressing drugs given to transplant patients to low, 
maintenance levels, Rao said. That reduces the patient's chances of 
falling victim to an infection the immune system cannot fight off. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the patients in the study has been taken completely off  
the drugs, Rao said, though that may be a possibility in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	How does the marrow work?  
</P>
<P>
	During fetal development, the thymus gland, which controls the  
immune system, instructs the system not to attack itself. When 
donor marrow cells are introduced, Rao said, they seem to make 
their way to the thymus and turn off the system that could attack 
them and lead to rejection of the donated organs.

<HEADLINE>  Colo. School Checked for Booby Traps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Working around bodies still lying where  
they fell more than a day earlier, bomb squad officers checked 
lockers and backpacks for booby traps Wednesday as investigators 
tried to piece together one of the deadliest school massacres in 
U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurling bombs and blasting away with guns, two students in black  
trench coats killed 12 schoolmates and a teacher Tuesday at 
Columbine High School, most of them in the library. The gunmen, 
Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, then apparently killed 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials were trying to determine if others were involved, and  
they questioned other members of the boys' dark group of outcasts, 
the ``Trenchcoat Mafia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities on Wednesday removed the bodies of two victims who  
died outside the building. Also, more than 24 hours after the 
attack, parents finally received official word of their children's 
fate. Police hoped to remove the other bodies later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators left the corpses in place overnight so that they  
could check for explosives and record the details of the crime 
scene, which SWAT members described as something from ``Dante's 
Inferno.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many bodies were sprawled on the floor, slumped in desks or  
crouched beneath tables, boxes and cubicles where they apparently 
tried to hide. Police found a handgun under one of the killers, and 
a semiautomatic rifle and two sawed-off shotguns elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a different sort of chaos inside,'' SWAT Sgt. George  
Hinkle said. ``There were fire alarms going off, strobe lights, 
four inches of water in the cafeteria. We had been told there were 
bombs in backpacks and there were backpacks everywhere. It was the 
toughest tactical problem I've ever seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said 30 explosive devices had  
been found at Columbine, in the killers' vehicles and at their 
homes. Late Tuesday, more than 10 hours after the shootings, a time 
bomb blew up, but no one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of these devices are on timing devices, some are  
incendiary devices and some are pipe bombs,'' Sheriff John Stone 
told ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' ``Some are like hand grenades 
that have got shrapnel in them wrapped around butane containers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven of the victims were male and four were female. District  
Attorney Dave Thomas said there was no evidence that the killers 
targeted minorities, as some students claimed. Only one of the 13 
victims was black. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've only seen the photographs, but it appears to me that most  
of the victims were victims because of where they were at a 
particular time, not that they were sought out,'' Thomas said. 
``Most of the victims were in the library, and that's where these 
two persons ended up. ... I don't know what the motive was other 
than anger. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixteen people remained hospitalized, 11 in critical or serious  
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Klebold's parents have not spoken to reporters, and Harris'  
parents issued a statement saying only: ``We want to express our 
heartfelt sympathy to the families of all the victims and to all 
the community for this senseless tragedy. Please say prayers for 
everyone touched by these terrible events.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said Harris and Klebold targeted athletes and  
minorities, laughing at their victims and using a racial epithet to 
describe the black victim. ``All jocks stand up!'' one of the boys 
yelled during Tuesday's attack. ``We're going to kill every one of 
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some students lay still and quiet on the floor, listening as the  
gunmen finished off the wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Classmates said the boys were outcasts who wore black, played  
war games and sometimes wore Nazi symbols. According to classmates, 
the boys admired Adolf Hitler and apparently picked his birthday 
for the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine student Brooks Brown, 18, said Harris had once  
threatened to kill him, but later had resumed their friendship. 
Brown said he saw Harris carrying a duffel bag as he walked into 
the school on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was walking out for a cigarette and I told him, `Hey, man,'  
and he said, `Brooks, I like you. Now, get out of here. Go home.''' 
Brown said. ``And so I didn't think twice about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris and Klebold had a juvenile record, but not for anything  
violent -- they were caught breaking into a car. They completed a 
program that allowed them to clear their record, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	While investigators continued their work, memorial services were  
held across the city Wednesday, and dozens of counselors offered 
support to grieving students, parents, friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hundred students from around the Denver area gathered at  
a park near the school Wednesday, many with their parents. Bouquets 
were scattered around the grounds. Students placed flowers and 
other mementos on a car driven to school Tuesday by one of the 
students believed to be killed. 
</P>
<P>
	A poster on a wall in the park near the school contained  
messages of condolence and scorn. 
</P>
<P>
	``These flowers and prayers are for the innocent victims and  
their families, not for the two monsters that committed these 
selfish and violent acts,'' the poster said. ``Who were you two to 
decide what should happen to these people? We're here for you, 
Columbine High School. Love, Arvada West.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Red-eyed students, including one girl wearing a T-shirt listing  
the names of Columbine's '99 senior class, streamed into the Light 
of the World Church for a memorial service and a noon prayer vigil. 
</P>
<P>
	``How can you reassure someone who has just seen devastation?''  
said Rochelle Brunsdon of the Jefferson Center for Mental Health. 
``We're going to talk to people about the experience they've had, 
how they can go on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the church, visitors placed flowers and cards at the  
base of a weathered 12-foot cross leaning sideways against a tree. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, the district attorney, said that during the rampage, a  
representative of Klebold's father called authorities and said the 
father was willing to help negotiate, but the offer was rejected 
because officials felt there was little he could do. 
</P>
<P>
	The massacre forced the closing of all schools in the Jefferson  
County school district, which has 89,000 students and is Colorado's 
largest. Rick Kaufman, a district spokesman, said all schools 
except Columbine would open again Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials were examining ways to get Columbine students into  
other schools, because it was uncertain the school would open again 
before the end of the school year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hockey's Colorado Avalanche postponed two playoff games in  
Denver this week, and baseball's Colorado Rockies on Wednesday 
called off their game for the second night in a row. Rockies 
players and coaches will wear a Columbine High patch on their 
sleeves for the rest of the season.

<HEADLINE> Experts Consider School Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Could it happen here? That was a question many  
principals and superintendents asked last year after a spate of 
school shootings across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	So they increased security, bought metal detectors and  
surveillance cameras, created profiles of potentially violent 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	But as another school shooting tragedy unfolded in Littleton,  
Colo., on Tuesday, officials questioned whether any school could 
protect against such deadly events. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's one of the great mysteries -- how do you identify a  
student who is going to act out?'' said Barbara Wheeler, school 
board member in Downers Grove, Ill., and former president of the 
National School Boards Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Some schools, adopting an attitude that it's better to be safe  
than sorry, have responded to the slightest sign of troubled 
students: 
</P>
<P>
	-- A high school student in Starkville, Miss., was arrested in  
February and faces criminal charges for having a gun on school 
property. 
</P>
<P>
	-- An eighth-grader in Clarion County, Pa., who had a gun and  
repeated a threat to kill teachers was arrested at Union High 
School after a fellow student told his mother of threats. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A ninth-grade girl in Fairfax County, Va., was suspended when  
she wrote a note to a fellow student expressing anger about her 
teacher giving her a D, and the teacher took it as a physical 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
	William Modzeleski, the Education Department's safe schools  
chief, said schools have used federal and state money to identify 
and treat students who need mental health services. Schools have 
also gotten more federal money in the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
	Six months ago President Clinton held a White House conference  
on school violence with about 800 educators and law-enforcement 
officials. But Tuesday night, he acknowledged the nation had made 
little progress in solving the violence problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know there are a lot of kids out there who ... who build  
up these grievances in their own mind and who are not being 
reached,'' Clinton said. ``And it's not just Littleton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the federal Safe and Drug Free Schools program -- now funded  
at $600 million a year -- began five years ago, it focused on 
student drug abuse. But in recent years, the focus has shifted to 
school security. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials still say schools are safe. In 1996, theft  
accounted for 62 percent of crimes against students at school. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is the perception that schools are terribly  
crime-ridden. The perception is unfounded,'' Modzeleski said. 
</P>
<P>
	As the 1997-98 year showed, violence can even erupt at schools  
that seem safe to teachers and parents. 
</P>
<P>
	In March of last year, two boys in Jonesboro, Ark., opened fire  
on a crowd of students at their middle school, killing four 
classmates and a teacher. Students also were accused of fatal 
shootings in Springfield, Ore., West Paducah, Ky., and Pearl, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, a high school sophomore in Notus, Idaho, was  
accused of firing a shotgun in a school hallway. No one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Most school districts haven't faced legal action for not  
preventing crimes, but they have been held liable for violating 
students' rights when imposing penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet schools have not backed off developing policies because of  
the threat of lawsuits, Modzeleski said. They have been working 
with attorneys to develop fair policies. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not clear what policies were followed at Columbine High  
School in the middle-class suburb of Littleton, where gunmen -- 
believed to be fellow students -- opened fire Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Deborah Fallon, a spokeswoman for the Colorado Education  
Association, said the state's 176 districts set their own policies.

<HEADLINE> Clashes in Eastern Indonesia Kill 4 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Police and troops patrolled an eastern  
Indonesian island Wednesday after fighting between Christians and 
Muslims left four people dead and dozens of buildings gutted by 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Riots broke out Tuesday on Banda island in Maluku province,  
where religious unrest has killed more than 300 people this year. 
Thousands of houses and dozens of churches and mosques have been 
burned. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Tuesday's rioting started when residents attacked  
another group of villagers. 
</P>
<P>
	Police did not say whether Muslims or Christians triggered the  
violence. Authorities said two houses or worship were burned but 
did not specify whether they were Muslim or Christian. 
</P>
<P>
	A kindergarten was among the buildings that were set on fire.  
</P>
<P>
	Maluku province is 1,400 miles northeast of Jakarta, the  
Indonesian capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia has been plagued by civil unrest since the downfall in  
May of former authoritarian President Suharto. Motives for the 
fighting include economic hardship, political disputes and 
religious and ethnic tensions. 
</P>
<P>
	Suharto, like many other Indonesians, has only one name.  
</P>
<P>
	On Sumatra Island, 1,500 students attacked a housing complex  
belonging to a subsidiary of an American oil company and set 29 
cars on fire, a newspaper reported Wednesday. At least 11 people 
were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Security forces fired shots in the air to disperse protesters  
during the attack Tuesday on facilities of the subsidiary of Caltex 
Petroleum Corp. in Rumbai town. 
</P>
<P>
	Caltex spokesman Renville Almatsier said the students demanded  
that the company give 10 percent of its revenue to the region, The 
Jakarta Post reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``They told us to stop operating until we fulfill their demand.  
But we rejected such a condition,'' the newspaper quoted Renville 
as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's incident marked an escalation of efforts in Sumatra's  
Riau province to gain a larger share of revenues from the region's 
natural resources.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks that moved substantially or traded  
heavily Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock 
Market. 

</P>
<P>
                               *NYSE    	

</P>
<P>
 *Cadence Design Systems Inc. fell 8 5/16 to 12 1/2.    	
</P>
<P>
	The company, which sells software and services that aid the  
design of electronic products, reported operating earnings late 
Tuesday of 31 cents a share, meeting analysts' estimates. But the 
company said it expects slower revenue and earning growth for the 
remainder of 1999. Several Wall Street firms downgraded the stock. 

</P>
<P>
 *Borders Group Inc. fell 2 7/16 at 14 5/8.    	
</P>
<P>
	Chief executive Philip M. Pfeffer resigned from the nation's  
second-largest bookstore chain, and the company expects to take a 4 
cents-per-share charge against earnings because of his departure. 
Borders, which has failed to keep pace with brick-and-mortar rival 
Barnes &AMP; Noble and Internet giant Amazon.com, said its retail 
stores would post a profit of 4 to 5 cents per share for the 
quarter, but that Borders.com would lose 5 to 6 cents per share. 

</P>
<P>
 *Kaiser Aluminum fell 11/16 to 6 3/16.    	
</P>
<P>
	The aluminum processor reported a first-quarter loss of 48 cents  
a share, widely missing analysts' expected loss of 27 cents. The 
company said its results were hurt by low metal prices and lower 
shipments in all of its units. 

</P>
<P>
 *Lucent Technologies Inc. rose 4 7/8 to 59 1/8.  
</P>
<P>
 *Sprint rose 4 15/16 to 105 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent received a $780 million contract from Sprint for  
equipment and services to expand Sprint's wireless communications 
operations. On Tuesday, Sprint beat analysts' first-quarter 
earnings expectations and announced a 2-for-1 stock split. 

</P>
<P>
 *Kimberly-Clark Corp. rose 4 1/8 to 58 7/16.    	
</P>
<P>
	The paper products maker said Wednesday it earned 75 cents per  
share in the first quarter, up from 51 cents per share a year ago. 
Analysts cited strong increases in the company's profit margins, 
particularly in tissue and personal care products in North America, 
and significantly better European results. 

</P>
<P>
 *Boston Scientific rose 7 3/16 to 43 7/8.    	
</P>
<P>
	Late Tuesday, the medical device maker reported first-quarter  
net earnings of 25 cents per share, beating analysts' estimated 21 
cents, prompting several brokerage firms to upgrade the stock. 

</P>
<P>
                              *NASDAQ   	

</P>
<P>
 *Amgen Inc. fell 5 to 64.    	
</P>
<P>
	The drugmaker earned 46 cents a share in the first quarter,  
beating analysts' estimates of 44 cents. But the results were fed 
by a 30 percent growth in sales of the company's anemia drug 
Epogen. The company said they would rise only 20 percent going 
forward. 

</P>
<P>
 *Siebel Systems Inc. rose 1 7/16 at 36 15/16.    	
</P>
<P>
	The software maker's first-quarter results exceeded analysts'  
forecasts on a sharp increase in licenses and services. 
First-quarter profits were 20 cents a share, compared with 
estimates of 15 cents. Chief operating officer Pat House told Dow 
Jones the company expects the meet 1999 Wall Street estimates of 76 
cents a share. 

</P>
<P>
 *SkyTel Communications Inc. fell 1 3/4 to 15 3/16.    	
</P>
<P>
	The provider of wireless messaging systems company hired Warburg  
Dillon Read LLC to help it evaluate strategic alternatives. The 
company said it expects slower subscriber growth in the first 
quarter to dampen earnings growth for the rest of 1999. 

</P>
<P>
 *Lycos Inc. rose 27 5/8 to 101 1/2.    	
</P>
<P>
	The stock soared after a report from Media Metrix, a New York  
Internet research firm, indicated Lycos has the most-visited 
Internet portal. The report said Lycos' portal received 31.9 
million visitors in March, while Yahoo's portal received 31.2 
million visitors. Lycos has the third most popular Web site 
overall, with America Online and Microsoft sites holding on to the 
top rankings.

<HEADLINE> Editorial Roundup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Here are excerpts from editorials in newspapers in the United  
States and abroad: 

</P>
<P>
	April 21  
</P>
<P>
	New York Post, on Littleton shootings:  
</P>
<P>
	Once again, Americans have been reminded that evil often comes  
in the most innocent-looking guises. 
</P>
<P>
	We don't yet know what prompted yesterday's horrific attack at  
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. But if past incidents are 
any predictor, there will be an outcry against the supposed ``youth 
gun culture.'' Some will search for other, psychological factors to 
divert responsibility away from those who committed the actual 
crime. ... 
</P>
<P>
	But evil can't always be explained away. ...  
</P>
<P>
	It's comforting to believe that this kind of evil can be avoided  
with the proper care and foresight. But such logical simply flies 
in the face of reality. Evil exists -- and sometimes it can't be 
understood. 

</P>
<P>
	April 21  
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles Times, on Littleton shootings:  
</P>
<P>
	``We should be safe at school,'' the girl sobbed. School  
``should be a safe place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The violence that swept through a high school in Littleton,  
Colo., Tuesday was far worse in sheer numbers than any of the 
lethal rampages that have struck campuses throughout the nation 
since 1996. But many of the same frightening ingredients were 
present. Again, the killers carried out the mayhem with firearms. 
Again, they were described by their student peers with comments 
like ``social outcasts ... people to stay away from.'' Again, they 
were young males filled with alienation and seething, irrational 
rage. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Who knows what went on in the minds of the young killers? Did  
they think they were avenging some adolescent slight? In a culture 
where real and fantasy violence is broadcast 24 hours a day, did 
they fully realize the permanence of their actions? Why is it that 
other kids seem to recognize a volatility in troubled youths that 
adults seem to miss? To these questions, there are no answers yet. 
There's only the ongoing fatal mix of hormones, hurt feelings and 
high-powered firearms. 

</P>
<P>
	April 16  
</P>
<P>
	The Advertiser-Tribune, Tiffin, Ohio, on Kosovo bombing:  
</P>
<P>
	As military analysts have pointed out, ``collateral damage'' --  
involving mistakes in which civilians are killed -- is nothing new 
in wartime. It has occurred for centuries and will continue to 
happen as long as nations or armed factions use weapons to settle 
their differences. 
</P>
<P>
	That does not make the deaths of dozens of ethnic Albanians,  
apparently killed in a NATO bombing attack, any more acceptable or 
any less horrifying. 
</P>
<P>
	It does, however, have the possibly desirable effect of helping  
to wake Americans up to the fact that what is going on in 
Yugoslavia right now is not some news event staged for CNN. People 
are dying over there. There is every likelihood that thousands -- 
perhaps tens of thousands -- more will perish before the war ends. 
</P>
<P>
	We honestly do not know what is to be done to end the war in  
Yugoslavia, much less to protect the hundreds of thousands of 
ethnic Albanians targeted for ``ethnic cleansing.'' What we do know 
is that President Clinton has used buckets of blood to paint 
himself and NATO into a corner out of which it will not be easy to 
escape. 
</P>
<P>
	We can only hope that the growing realization among Americans  
that this is war, with all its horrors, can help to build some 
national consensus on how this country is to proceed. 

</P>
<P>
	April 13  
</P>
<P>
	Albany (Ore.) Democrat-Herald, on Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	The recent NATO missile attack on a Yugoslavian passenger train  
symbolizes the futility of the wrong-headed policy of punishing the 
people of Serbia for the sins of their leader. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO said it was trying to hit the bridge the train was  
crossing. It regretted the deaths and injuries inflicted on 
civilians. 
</P>
<P>
	Here is the problem: The forces of Milosevic are reported to be  
killing and injuring civilians in Kosovo to acheive a political 
aim, which is keeping the province in their country and dominated 
by the Serb minority. 
</P>
<P>
	And NATO is killing and injuring civilians, also in order to  
achieve a political goal, namely to get Milosevic to stop what he 
is doing. 
</P>
<P>
	What's the difference? The purpose of NATO may be proper and  
good, especially the idea of trying to stop the atrocities against 
Kosovo civilians as reported by refugees. But the people killed by 
western bombs are just as dead as the Kosovars massacred by Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	After weeks of heavy bombing, much of Yugoslavia's economic base  
must lie in ruins by now. And the raids continue. Who is in charge 
of this war, and do they know that their tactics are not doing the 
job? 

</P>
<P>
	April 16.  
</P>
<P>
	The Post and Courier, Charleston, S.C., on U.S. involvement in  
Rwanda: 
</P>
<P>
	No question, Bill Clinton has intervened in humanitarian crises  
during his six-plus years in office. Bosnia comes to mind as well 
as Kosovo. But Rwanda, where the world stood by as more than 
500,000 innocents were slaughtered in 1994? We don't think so. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not the way Clinton describes it. ... In an interview  
with CBS anchor Dan Rather, ... the president said that while ``the 
rest of the world was caught flat-footed and did not have the 
mechanism to deal with'' the outbreak of tribal genocide, ``we did 
some good and I think limited some killing there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Human Rights Watch has looked into Rwanda. It finds otherwise.  
In a 789-page report cited by The Washington Post, it says the 
United States, France, Belgium and the United Nations all received 
ample warning of the genocide plot. 
</P>
<P>
	According to this report ... the United States actually blocked  
preventative military action by the United Nations. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, evidently uncomfortable with the charge that he failed  
to even try to prevent the greatest human tragedy of the 1990s, 
attempts to rewrite history ... just in case some of us were not 
paying attention. It won't work. 

</P>
<P>
	April 14  
</P>
<P>
	Seattle Post-Intelligencer, on the Clinton contempt ruling:  
</P>
<P>
	Everybody knows that Bill Clinton lied under oath in his  
deposition in the Paula Corbin Jones lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	So the ruling from a federal judge in Arkansas was an honorable  
announcement that underscores the rule of law and declares that 
even the president is not above the law. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright also did the world a  
favor by dismissing the president's comic acrobatics around the 
meaning of ``sexual relations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wright wrote that the president's Jan. 17, 1998, deposition  
testimony ``regarding whether he had ever been alone with Ms. 
Lewinsky was intentionally false, and his statements regarding 
whether he had ever engaged in sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky 
likewise were intentionally false, notwithstanding tortured 
definitions and interpretations of the term `sexual relations.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge took a law course from Professor Bill Clinton in the  
University of Arkansas School of Law and is married to a judicial 
scholar Clinton appointed to an important court task in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	But she has been evenhanded in her rulings in these depressing  
proceedings. Wright threw out the Paula Jones case just more than a 
year ago, but held Clinton accountable for the insult to the legal 
system inherent in ``false, misleading and evasive answers that 
were designed to obstruct the judicial process.'' ... 
</P>
<P>
	We hope that historians who track this whole tawdry affair will  
record that in the hands of Judge Susan Webber Wright, the judicial 
system did its job. 

</P>
<P>
	April 19  
</P>
<P>
	The Miami Herald, on India's weapons:  
</P>
<P>
	Last spring, India demonstrated to the world and its neighbors a  
capacity to build and explode nuclear bombs. This month, it 
showcased its ability to deliver those warheads at distances of up 
to 1,250 miles. Within minutes. ... 
</P>
<P>
	In a world that already has far too many nuclear weapons,  
India's push for nuclear competence is disturbing. ... With the 
United States leading by example, weapons stockpiles would be 
reduced and nonnuclear countries discouraged from joining the ranks 
of the mutually assured destroyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Clinton administration, however, nuclear disarmament  
has been relegated to a back burner. U.S. ratification of the 
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ... is stuck in Congress; our 
overtures to China have frightened India; NATO's expansion gave 
Russia the jitters, so much so that it now hesitates to 
decommission 3,000 warheads aimed at U.S. cities as required under 
the strategic-arms-reduction treaty, acronymed START II. ... 
</P>
<P>
	India's venture into the nuclear arena is a wake-up call for the  
United States, finally, to lead by its own good example. 

</P>
<P>
	April 14  
</P>
<P>
	Exponent-Telegram, Clarksburg, W.Va., on marijuana:  
</P>
<P>
	Marijuana as a drug? Not a good idea, we say, because ``medical  
marijuana'' is merely a subterfuge for ``recreational'' pot 
smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	Those driving the big push for laws to allow marijuana for  
medicinal purposes -- do they really expect, or want, their campaign 
to stop there? Hardly. 
</P>
<P>
	Since doctors already have safe and effective medicines for all  
the symptoms that smoked marijuana is purported to relieve, it 
somewhat cuts off at the pass the argument for legalizing pot 
smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	They must have only been reading the portion of the Institute of  
Medicine report that interested them rather than all of it. They 
must have been looking at the confirmation that marijuana's 
compounds provide modest relief for some patients suffering from 
various agonizing diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	But what the medical marijuana pushers may have missed ... was  
the portion that confirms that marijuana is a dangerous drug. 
</P>
<P>
	We are quite aware that there are many diseases that cause  
excruciating pain and severe discomfort, including terminal 
illnesses. However, the active ingredient in smoked marijuana is 
available in pill form. Even faster ways of delivering relief may 
be available in the not-too-distant future. We would have no real 
problem with the drug, if taken in those forms. 
</P>
<P>
	But with so many other means of alleviating pain or discomfort,  
to legalize the smoking of marijuana for the ailing would 
inevitably be the next step before legalizing it for the 
recreational marijuana smokers, including teen-agers. ... 

</P>
<P>
	April 22  
</P>
<P>
	Le Monde, Paris, on NATO and Milosevic:  
</P>
<P>
	The debate concerning the strategy of NATO is more than  
justified ... but none of it should overshadow what was essential: 
to act against the President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. 
...
</P>
<P>
	The strategists of NATO have sufficiently underestimated  
Belgrade's power for one to give them a piece of advice. Mr. 
Milosevic will fold all the more quickly when he knows that the 
allies are preparing a ground intervention. This has become in one 
way or another inevitable. ... 

</P>
<P>
	April 21  
</P>
<P>
	The Daily Telegraph, London, on NATO and Milosevic:  
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the outcome of the original war, the war to stop ethnic  
cleansing, NATO has now committed itself so deeply that it is in 
reality fighting to save its own credibility. If the war is now 
lost, or brought to an end with a shoddy compromise that cedes 
Milosevic ``cleansed'' territory in a partitioned Kosovo, it will 
do great injury to the Western security system and leave a 
dangerous power vacuum in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	The war now has to be fought with all means necessary for a  
successful conclusion. This does not mean taking Belgrade, but it 
does mean the expulsion of the Serb forces from Kosovo, the return 
of the refugees to their homes, and the establishment of a NATO 
protectorate. 

</P>
<P>
	April 21  
</P>
<P>
	The Mirror, London, on Serbs and Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic's subjects do not talk about ethnic cleansing, rape  
camps, slave labor gangs, torched villages or human shields. 
</P>
<P>
	When the subjects arise, they dismiss them as NATO propaganda.  
</P>
<P>
	They prefer to talk about their own hardships, which are minor  
compared to the horrors that Milosevic has inflicted upon Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	We know they are being lied to by the Serb state media. Perhaps,  
though, they are lying to themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Either way, they have added truth to the long list of other  
casualties in this war. 

</P>
<P>
	April 20  
</P>
<P>
	Sueddeutsche Zeitung, Munich, on Hungary and NATO:  
</P>
<P>
	Five weeks in NATO and one month at the front. That is the  
situation of a country, of which astonishingly little has been 
said. Hungary is the only member of NATO that borders directly on 
Yugoslavia. In view of the NATO attack(s) on the neighboring 
country, Hungary's government is doing the splits between loyalty 
to the Alliance and its own security interests. While the Magyars 
are among the six nations in the Alliance who are not taking part 
in the NATO attack against Serbia, they have still demonstrated 
loyalty. Is that now over? 
</P>
<P>
	... Budapest wants to know why NATO aircraft bombed Subotica in  
northern Serbia -- a city that is just 11 kilometers (six miles) 
from Hungary's border and where a majority of Hungarians live. The 
fears of the Budapest leadership lay at hand. Some 400,000 
Hungarians live in Vojvodina in north Serbia. They could also -- as 
revenge against NATO -- become victims of Serbian fury. Hungary must 
then expect a refugee wave, which is now breaking over Macedonia 
and Albania. 
</P>
<P>
	The fears are justified, but a double game cannot be justified.  
German Chancellor (Gerhard) Schroeder claims that Russian oil is 
flowing through Hungarian pipelines to Serbia. If that's correct -- 
despite Budapest's denial -- NATO is making a laughing stock of 
itself with its bombs on Serbian refineries. Quicker than expected 
the new members of NATO have been shown more is required than nice 
words. Hungary's acceptance (in NATO) is completed, now comes the 
test. 

</P>
<P>
	April 21  
</P>
<P>
	Il Messaggero, Rome, on war in Kosovo:  
</P>
<P>
	Wars last well beyond peace, and leave their sign on a nation,  
on an entire part of the world, for a period of time that we cannot 
determine. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday it will be a month since the start of the -- never  
declared -- war on Serbia. Thirty days which have brought insecurity 
back to a continent ... forcing a generation who did not even know 
the meaning of the word, to talk about war like one talks about 
soccer. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone wonders: how much longer will it last? When will  
(Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic decide he has had enough? 
</P>
<P>
	It took Saddam Hussein 38 days. But nobody knows now. Secretly,  
we are thinking about ground troops, about the massacre of 
bayonets. In the meantime Serbs put landmines at their borders. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Studying the faces of the children and women that appear on the  
news, we can say that this earthquake of consciences will last well 
beyond the end of the conflict. 

</P>
<P>
	April 20  
</P>
<P>
	Neue Zuercher Zeitung, Zurich, Switzerland, on Turkish  
elections: 
</P>
<P>
	When Turkish voters chose their new parliament Sunday, they  
decided with surprising clarity on a new course. 
</P>
<P>
	As expected, outgoing Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit's Democratic  
Left Party emerged as the strongest party. 
</P>
<P>
	But the far-right Nationalist Movement Party, the real winner of  
these elections, could establish itself as the second strongest 
force. Just four years ago, the ultranationalists didn't gain the 
10 percent of the vote they needed to get into parliament. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The voters' clear verdict doesn't fulfill hopes for a more  
politically and economically stable period. The Istanbul stock 
exchange reacted Monday with heavy losses. 
</P>
<P>
	There are ominous signs for the coming months, following the  
flare-up of clashes between Kurdish rebels and the army in recent 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	If, as the ultranationalists have already loudly demanded,  
(Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah) Ocalan is executed after his trial, 
instability can be expected across the country. ... 

</P>
<P>
	April 15  
</P>
<P>
	Asahi Shimbun, Tokyo, on missile tests in Pakistan and India:  
</P>
<P>
	The race to develop warheads and missiles under a climate of  
rivalry and nationalism can undermine the peace and stability of 
the South Asia region in one fell swoop. We are deeply concerned 
about the nuclear weapons race being waged by India and Pakistan 
and we urge them to halt further development and testing of 
missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	In the face of economic crises, nations are squandering money  
and people on development of nuclear weapons and missiles. That is 
a paradox of the modern world. 
</P>
<P>
	India and Pakistan deserve denunciation. At the same time,  
however, we hasten to observe that the United States and four other 
nuclear powers also bear responsibility for this situation. By 
their negligence in working to abolish nuclear weapons, they have, 
in a way, contributed to South Asia's nuclear arms race. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, which has called on India and Pakistan to  
stop their nuclear development, has not yet ratified the 
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese government must maintain presistent pressure on the  
two countries to give up development of nuclear weapons and 
missiles. The suspension of economic assistance will have to be 
maintained until they change their attitude. 

</P>
<P>
	April 19  
</P>
<P>
	The Nation, Bangkok, Thailand, on the conviction of former  
Malaysian deputy premier Anwar Ibrahim: 
</P>
<P>
	For a trial so closely watched around the world, the verdict was  
no big surprise. On Wednesday, Malaysia's former prime 
minister-in-waiting, Anwar Ibrahim, was slapped with a six-year 
jail sentence. ... It would be very difficult, though not 
impossible, for Anwar to mount a political comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 1,000 protesters turned up outside the courtroom on the day  
Anwar was sentenced. Among them was Tian Chua, a key leader from 
the newly minted National Justice Party. Tian gallantly sat in 
front of a police truck which was spraying eye-burning water on the 
protesters. For his act of peaceful civil disobedience, Tian was 
bludgeoned on the head by a baton and repeatedly punched and 
kicked. Later, the police charged a bruised and bleeding Tian for, 
yes, attempting to ``commit suicide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, there is no end to the travesty of justice in Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> Colorado Teams Postpone Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- A grief-stricken city had no time for games.  
</P>
<P>
	For the second day, Denver's professional sports teams postponed  
scheduled games after 15 shooting deaths at a suburban high school. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado Avalanche on Wednesday postponed their first two  
NHL playoff games, and the Colorado Rockies called off a baseball 
game. The Rockies and the NBA's Nuggets postponed games on Tuesday, 
the day of the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing ownership sentiment that ``we have to act like all these  
kids are our kids,'' Avalanche general manager Pierre Lacroix said 
his team and the San Jose Sharks will not play the first two games 
of their best-of-7 series on Wednesday night and Thursday night as 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the series will open on Saturday in San Jose, which  
originally was to be Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Game 2 will be in San Jose on Monday, with the series shifting  
to Denver for games on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday of that week. 
Game 6, if necessary, would be the following Monday in San Jose, 
and Game 7 would be back in Denver -- tentatively set for Tuesday, 
May 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's our way to show respect to the community for this tragic  
situation,'' Lacroix said. ``Our prayers are with the families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lacroix began pondering scheduling alternatives on Tuesday  
night, just hours after the extent of the shooting, which left 15 
dead and two dozen injured, became known. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a conversation with (owner) Charlie Lyons, and his  
reaction was that we are close to this community and we have to act 
like all these kids are our kids,'' Lacroix said. ``With the 
support of the San Jose Sharks organization, we agreed to start the 
series in San Jose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Avalanche still would play host to four games of  
the seven-game series, the sometimes-pivotal first two games will 
be staged in San Jose instead of Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if that amounts to a disadvantage for his team, Lacroix  
said, ``We don't look at this in any way, shape or form as an 
advantage or a disadvantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharks general manager Dean Lombardi agreed with the decision to  
reschedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's any way we could have played (Wednesday  
night),'' he said. ``From what I understand, the bodies are still 
in there (the school). We talked about starting Thursday night, and 
we threw that out. I don't see how you could play here on Saturday 
either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNichols Arena is unavailable on Friday because of the Nuggets'  
game against Golden State. Tuesday's postponed game with Portland 
was rescheduled for May 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's enough time for both teams to adjust,''  
Lombardi said. ``Once we have all regrouped and started on 
Saturday, we'll go from there, so there is no competitive edge. 
There might be an effect if it goes to Game 7. The team going into 
the second round might have a disadvantage (because of fatigue).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Avalanche forward Claude Lemieux wondered aloud if playing the  
games as scheduled ``might have provided some distraction and 
helped more than just offering our prayers and thoughts. I don't 
know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux, who lives 20 minutes from the school, said ``the more  
they were showing on TV, the more faces I would recognize. I went 
to pick up my car (Tuesday), and the service manager said his 
daughter was at the school. Everybody was terrified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Odgers noted there are ``a lot of fathers in this (locker)  
room. You send your kid off to school, and it's supposed to be the 
best years of your life, especially in high school. Nobody should 
have to go through what those people are going through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to postpone also was applauded by Sharks goalie  
Mike Vernon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the right thing to do,'' he said. ``This hit too close  
to home for me. I can't imagine what the people in the Denver area 
and the families involved are going through. It's going to affect 
people for the rest of their lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Coors Field, the Rockies postponed Wednesday's game against  
Montreal, just as it had postponed Tuesday's. The teams will play 
two split doubleheaders when the Expos return to Denver on Aug. 
13-15, but the exact dates of the doubleheaders haven't been set. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are deeply saddened by the events in Littleton, and now is  
not the time to play baseball,'' Rockies vice chairman Charlie 
Monfort said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies were scheduled to open a four-game series in San  
Francisco today. Team officials announced the players and coaches 
will wear a Columbine High School patch on their right sleeves for 
the remainder of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Montreal manager Felipe Alou agreed with the postponements.  
</P>
<P>
	``We aren't in Chicago or Miami or Los Angeles,'' Alou said.  
``We are right next door to where this thing happened and where 
there are still bodies inside the school. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it will cause some inconvenience having to play two  
doubleheaders in August. But it is more important that we put some 
time between us and this incident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alou recalled his playing days with Atlanta in 1968 when games  
were interrupted by the assassinations of Martin Luther King and 
Robert Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't play three days,'' Alou said. ``I know Sen. Kennedy  
was a great American, but he was one man. What have they found, 13 
or so dead? And right here in town. When Martin Luther King was 
assassinated, we didn't play for a number of days and that was at 
the beginning of the season.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Drug Treatment Cuts Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Arizona's voter-approved program of sentencing  
nonviolent, first- and second-time drug offenders to treatment 
rather than prison reduces crime and saves tax money, according to 
a state Supreme Court study. 
</P>
<P>
	The program is part of a 1996 law, which also allows doctors to  
prescribe marijuana and some other outlawed drugs to severely or 
terminally ill patients. It was repealed by the legislature but 
reapproved last fall in a public referendum. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, ordered by the Legislature, found the drug offender  
program saved taxpayers more than $2.56 million, and that 78 
percent of the participants later tested drug-free. 
</P>
<P>
	``The outcome benefits of this intervention over time will  
reveal not only fiscal and crime reduction benefits, but an 
increase in quality of life conditions of this population such as 
improved family and social relationships, increased work 
productivity and wages, and decreased health system costs,'' the 
high court said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Blanchard, legal counsel with the Office of National Drug  
Control Policy, said of the study that drug treatment rather than 
prison ``is a no-brainer'' way to fight crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you really want to solve the crime problem, you have to  
deal with the treatment side,'' the former Arizona lawmaker said. 
</P>
<P>
	The court looked at 2,622 drug offenders placed on probation and  
in county-run drug treatment programs from July 1997 to June 1998. 
There are five treatment programs varying in intensity and duration 
depending on the severity of an offender's addiction and 
psychological problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also found that 77 percent of the participants made at  
least one of the required payments toward the cost of their 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``As it turns out, the (law) is doing more to reduce drug use  
and crime than any other state program -- and saving taxpayer 
dollars at the same time,'' said Judge Rudy Gerber of the Arizona 
Court of Appeals in Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Supreme Court study didn't fully gauge the success  
of treatment programs because it excluded recidivism rates. Court 
officials said they'll look at those rates after the end of the 
current fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This study was only for the first year of the program,'' said  
Barbara Broderick, the court's director of adult services. ``We 
eventually want to be able look at quality of life indicators -- 
such as if they're drug-free, have a job, are paying taxes and 
restitution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study was criticized by the Maricopa County Attorney's  
Office. The county includes Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	``This report does a disservice to the Supreme Court in that it  
gives the illusion all this money is being saved,'' said Deputy 
County Attorney Barnett Lotstein. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it's misleading for the court to include first-time  
offenders among those kept from prison because they would never be 
imprisoned. 
</P>
<P>
	Maricopa County has offered its own drug treatment diversion  
programs for first-time offenders for the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona is not the first state to conclude that such programs  
work. Nevada officials, for instance, say their diversion and 
treatments programs are working to keep offenders off drugs and 
from committing crimes while freeing up jail space for violent 
offenders.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Juggles War, NATO Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Leading a bombing campaign in Europe and a  
NATO summit in Washington, President Clinton is trying to refurbish 
his impeachment-stained legacy with images of his role as commander 
in chief and global statesman at a moment of world crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Since airstrikes began in Yugoslavia four weeks ago, the  
president has been pictured against a backdrop of fighter jets and 
long-range bombers. He has listened to war stories from pilots and 
talked with families of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, world leaders will pour into Washington for a NATO 50th  
anniversary summit presided over by Clinton. He will orchestrate 
three days of wartime talks and stand at center stage when 
presidents and prime ministers pose for their traditional class 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be a visible testament to the president's success so far  
in preserving the unity and resolve of allies who often bristle 
when Washington takes the lead. Now, however, they are standing 
with the president to bring Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic 
to heel. 
</P>
<P>
	It is a far cry from the scene just 10 weeks ago when Clinton's  
defenders in the Senate rescued him from being thrown from power in 
an impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``The country indulged itself in a spasm of scandal and  
impeachment for one long year because the world was relatively 
quiescent and the economy was pumping,'' said Thomas E. Mann, 
director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution. 
``Now, the real world has intruded and Clinton and our country have 
no choice other than for him to respond and to act and to lead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The war gives Americans a different picture of Clinton than as  
the troubled co-star of the Monica Lewinsky soap opera. 
</P>
<P>
	``They see the president dealing with presidential issues rather  
than an investigation of his private life,'' said pollster Andrew 
Kohut of the Pew Research Center. ``While he may have a few more 
critics, he is seen as a president rather than as a defendant. 
There are some downsides: the responsibilities for policy issues 
rest with the president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Already, there are signs of concern among Americans about costs,  
potential casualties and the eventual success or failure of the 
allies' campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's job approval rating, which stayed above 60 percent  
throughout the long impeachment ordeal, has slipped to 56 percent 
in recent days. The approval rating for his handling of foreign 
policy has dipped from 56 percent to 51 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``These don't represent sea changes in public opinion but they  
might represent the possibility of real change if people continue 
to worry more, or if people think things are going poorly,'' Kohut 
said. ``There is more worry, and people are pessimistic about it. 
There is a little bit of deteriorating in attitudes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added, ``There's not enough public support here for a lot of  
casualties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NATO summit is expected to underscore the allies'  
determination to force Milosevic's troops from Kosovo, allow the 
return of hundreds of thousands of refugees and permit the 
deployment of an international peacekeeping force. Clinton also is 
calling on his partners to approve preliminary plans for the 
reconstruction of the war-torn Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	On a broader scale, the allies will approve a revised  
``strategic concept'' for the alliance -- a so-called vision 
statement of new roles and challenges NATO will undertake in a new 
century absent the threat of a Soviet Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright points to Kosovo as a  
prime example of the type of new mission NATO should undertake, far 
beyond its traditional role of collective defense against an attack 
on any member nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Some fear that the alliance's new assignments and its inclusion  
of new members will stretch NATO too thin, producing a less secure 
Europe or a less effective NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	``My view of the summit,'' said Michael Mandelbaum of the  
Council on Foreign Relations, ``is this is a funeral disguised as a 
wedding. The best thing Clinton can do is hope to get through it. 
The new NATO is dead on arrival. All the celebrants will pretend 
not to notice that.''

<HEADLINE> Poor Corporate Performers Listed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO (AP) -- Tyson Foods Inc., and Circus Circus  
Enterprises top the annual ``corporate America's poorest 
performers'' list compiled by California's biggest investor, the 
$155 billion California Public Employees Retirement System. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson, a large Arkansas-based food processing company, issued a  
written statement that a corporate restructuring resolved the many 
concerns raised by CalPERS. 
</P>
<P>
	Circus Circus spokeswoman Sarah Ralston said the CalPERS  
complaints were based on ``shoddy research'' about the Las 
Vegas-based casino and hotel firm's corporate organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson stock purchased in 1992 increased 59 percent in value over  
five years, CalPERS said, compared to an average growth of 156 
percent in the food and beverage industry and a 147 percent average 
for all 1,600 U.S. stocks in which CalPERS invests. 
</P>
<P>
	Circus Circus stock purchased in 1992 decreased 37 percent in  
value over five years, compared to an average increase of 13 
percent in other ``leisure service'' industries. 
</P>
<P>
	CalPERS spokesman Brad Pacheco said the poorest-performers  
report, issued annually for the past 12 years, is one of a number 
of tools CalPERS uses to prod companies to address concerns raised 
by the pension fund's investment committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said CalPERS had stated its concerns in meetings with  
both firms, but that no corrective action had been taken. Seven 
other companies listed on CalPERS' poorest-performers list for 1998 
all took actions to correct some or all of CalPERS' complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are long-haul investors. .... We are not in and out. Our  
goal as long-term owners is to enhance long-term values,'' Pacheco 
said, explaining why CalPERS tries to change policies of 
corporations it believes are not performing well rather than simply 
selling its stock. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tyson's case, the CalPERS report described the firm's new  
management as ``very promising,'' but said that it still wants to 
see Tyson end its dual-class stock structure. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson said its dual-class stock structure ``has provided the  
flexibility and continuity our company has needed to become the 
industry leader... .'' 
</P>
<P>
	Circus Circus was criticized by CalPERS for not having enough  
independent directors on its board 
</P>
<P>
	Others on the worst-performers list taking corrective actions  
sought by CalPERS were National Semiconductor, Mallinckrodt, St. 
Jude Medical, Sierra Health, Pioneer Natural Resources, Pacific 
Century Financial Corp. and Cummins Engine. 
</P>
<P>
	CalPERS is a pension system for 330,000 retirees and 770,000  
active state and local government employees. It has $68 billion of 
its assets in U.S. stocks, with the remaining $87 billion in bonds, 
real estate and foreign securities.

<HEADLINE> Hurricanes Playoff Drought Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- The Carolina Hurricanes will wipe away  
their NHL playoff cobwebs Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's opener in a best-of-7 first-round series against the  
Boston Bruins will be the franchise's first postseason appearance 
since 1992, when it was the Hartford Whalers. 
</P>
<P>
	Until winning the Southeast Division this season, the six-year  
playoff drought was the longest in the league. In fact, the 
franchise has won only one playoff series in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not well respected in the league because of our  
history, and I think a lot of people don't know about us,'' said 
Carolina coach Paul Maurice, pointing out that the team wasn't even 
on national television until March. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's fine. Personally, that's the way I like it. I would be  
much happier if nobody wrote a good article about us for a long 
time, just say, `No, they can't possibly win the first round, and 
then ah, they can't possibly win a second.' Let's just keep going 
like that and we'll be fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston coach Pat Burns agreed that the pressure may be on the  
Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're the favorites this year and we have to live with that,''  
Burns said. ``We have to go out there and make sure that we are 
ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maurice said his club is confident it can compete against the  
tight-checking Bruins, who finished sixth in the Eastern 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't feel tension out there but I certainly didn't feel a  
lot of looseness,'' Maurice said after Wednesday's practice when 
asked if his club was nervous. ``It was businesslike. It has been 
like that in the meetings we've had, very focused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, with players like Keith Primeau, Ron Francis, Ray  
Sheppard, Gary Roberts and Glen Wesley, Carolina actually has the 
playoff experience edge over the Bruins, although with teams other 
than the Hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a lot of these older guys this is old hat,'' said Maurice,  
who at 31 will be making his playoff debut as the youngest coach in 
pro sports. ``It has been a lot like the first week of training 
camp. Everybody has been focused, everybody wants to get back on 
the ice and show the coaches that, `Hey, maybe I can do a little 
more this year.''' 
</P>
<P>
	This series is expected to be played close to the vest. The  
teams were 2-2-1 in the regular-season series and both have 
excellent goaltenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Byron Dafoe had a career year for Boston with a league-high 10  
shutouts. He's also coming into the postseason on a hot streak, 
finishing 6-0 with a 1.15 goals-against average. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played five good games against them all season, and I don't  
expect the playoffs to be any different,'' Dafoe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arturs Irbe had a career-high six shutouts for Carolina and tied  
for fourth in the league with a .923 save percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurice said he came up empty searching for film of teams who  
successfully penetrated Boston's sturdy defense, led by perennial 
all-star Ray Bourque. 
</P>
<P>
	``There weren't any,'' Maurice said. ``They are a great  
defensive team. But we've got enough grit up front where we should 
be able to work the corners on them. That's where this series will 
be won -- in the corners and along the boards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Or maybe with special teams. The Hurricanes are dead last in the  
NHL on the power play, while the Bruins are the best at killing 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am going to play physical like I did all year,'' said  
Roberts, who leads the NHL in hits. ``You just can't go out of your 
way to be physical, because if you do that, you take penalties and 
they made you look bad. They've got some very smart players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston center Joe Thornton, who played 81 of 82 games during the  
regular season, won't suit up in the opener because of a strained

with 16 goals and 25 assists.

	``It's not going to affect their hockey team a whole lot, and

<HEADLINE> Goodyear Earnings Fall 25 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber Co. earnings fell 25  
percent amid depressed demand from Asian and Latin American 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear reported that excluding one-time restructuring charges,  
it earned $141.5 million, or 90 cents a share, down from 
first-quarter 1998 profits of $176.8 million, or $1.11 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	The results matched the estimates of analysts surveyed by First  
Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales fell to $2.99 billion from $3.09 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear took $167.4 million in charges during the quarter to  
cut 4,200 jobs worldwide and save $150 million in expenses a year. 
When those charges are factored in, the company's earnings dropped 
to $25.5 million, or 16 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges cover the cost of previously announced staff cuts  
including a combined 1,600 jobs in Gadsden, Ala., and Freeport, 
Ill., almost 300 in Europe, 1,500 in Latin America and 800 in 
Goodyear's chemical, engineered products and Asia tire divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	First-quarter tire sales dropped in North and South America and  
Asia due to weak economies in those regions. But sales rose in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Samir G. Gibara, chairman and chief executive officer, said  
Goodyear's second-quarter profits would be hurt by the cost of 
cutting inventories and because of the weak economies in emerging 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, the benefits of our growth and rationalization  
(restructuring) initiatives, and the progressive economic recovery 
in emerging markets, should be reflected in the company's 
second-half results,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Y2K Problems Pose Big Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Likely computer failures overseas pose  
America's greatest threat from the Year 2000 glitch, the White 
House predicted today, adding that problems in this country are 
unlikely in key industries. 
</P>
<P>
	In its latest report on preparing for the Y2K technology  
problem, the Clinton administration warned that failures are all 
but certain in some foreign countries because of late efforts there 
to begin repairing important computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House said those problems will affect Americans living  
abroad, but also will cause ripples in the global economy -- due to 
international travel and trade -- sure to be felt in the United 
States, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``It now appears that a number of countries will experience Y2K  
failures in key infrastructures such as electric power, 
telecommunications and transportation,'' said the report from the 
President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion. 
</P>
<P>
	It was being presented formally later in the day.  
</P>
<P>
	An administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said U.S. industry experts advising the government lack confidence 
about overseas airports and air-traffic control systems, foreign 
telephone networks and routine imports of some types of foods. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a pretty consistent thread across the board,'' the  
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many computers originally programmed to recognize only the last  
two digits of a year will not work properly beginning Jan. 1, 2000, 
when some machines will assume it is 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	The report includes generally positive news about U.S. efforts  
in some of the most important areas, such as electricity, 
telephones, banking and transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	It predicted that national failures in those areas is unlikely,  
although it cautioned about ``minor disruptions which may impact 
consumers minimally'' from oil and natural gas companies. 
</P>
<P>
	But the report was harshly critical of hospitals and doctors  
offices for failing to verify their computer billing systems will 
tolerate the date change, saying that small health providers may be 
forced to shut down. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration said it anticipates no widespread or severe  
disruptions in the nation's food supply, in part because large 
grocery chains already carry several weeks' inventory in case of 
delivery problems or bad weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcasters probably won't experience problems, either.  
</P>
<P>
	``The public should continue to have access to television and  
radio broadcast services through the date rollover,'' the report 
said, warning only of ``isolated channel outages and limited 
problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly half the federal agencies failed to meet last month's  
deadline to have their most important computers fixed, although the 
administration said 93 percent of those systems are now ready for 
2000.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Up at Midday / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stock prices advanced Thursday following  
another record high close on Wall Street overnight. The U.S. dollar 
gained against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 73.49 points,  
or 0.45 percent, to finish the morning session at 16,568.51 points. 
On Wednesday, the average lost 202.09 points, or 1.21 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.33 yen at midday, up 1.35 yen from late in  
Tokyo on Wednesday and also above its late New York level of 119.73 
yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, Tokyo share prices edged higher as  
investors were encouraged by a jump in the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average of 132.87 points, or 1.3 percent, to a new record high of 
10,581.42. 
</P>
<P>
	But traders said the Nikkei's gains were limited by concerns  
about the economy after the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday 
lowered its forecast for growth of the nation's gross domestic 
product. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors also turned cautious ahead of a string Japanese  
national holidays beginning next week. Japanese financial markets 
will be closed April 29 and May 3-5. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 3.00 points, or 0.23 percent, to 1,314.76. The 
TOPIX closed down 17.14 points, or 1.29 percent on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar was locked in a narrow range as  
support for the greenback from U.S. funds, including investment 
banks, was offset by selling pressure from Japanese exporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as the dollar goes up, Japanese exporters come in,''  
said Takeo Suzuki, deputy foreign exchange manager at Nomura Trust 
and Banking. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar rose sharply overnight in New York following the  
IMF's report on the world economy, which predicted that Japan's 
economy would shrink more this year than previously expected. 
</P>
<P>
	In other major currencies, the euro was traded at 127.64, up  
from 126.30 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 211 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.530 percent from 1.515 percent Wednesday, driving 
its price down to 102.36 yen from 102.50 yen

<HEADLINE> `Trenchcoat Mafia' Were Outcasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- They called themselves the ``Trenchcoat  
Mafia,'' a dozen outcast students who hated blacks, Hispanics, Jews 
and athletes, and dressed up in long black dusters, like villains 
of the Old West. 
</P>
<P>
	They played World War II games, bragged about their guns, and  
razzed fellow students about kowtowing to the elite students at 
Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	But few students took them seriously until Tuesday, when police  
said two members of the rebellious group took out guns and started 
firing. 
</P>
<P>
	Classmates and Denver media identified the dead gunmen as Eric  
Harris and Dylan Klebold, both juniors at the school. Police 
refused to confirm the identities, but were seen at Harris' home, 
carrying out items including a computer. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``trenchcoats'' were seen as smart and computer-savvy,  
fellow students said. Harris lived in a tidy, two-story home on a 
quiet suburban cul-de-sac -- deserted today except for a steady 
stream of reporters driving through the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Sean Kelly, a 16-year-old junior, shared a computer lab with  
Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	``They just didn't seem to be all there. They liked things like  
Soldier of Fortune magazine,'' Kelly said. Harris made his own 
video production at school in which he bragged about some of his 
new guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said the two boys killed themselves following a  
``suicide mission'' in which they marched through the school, 
hurling pipe bombs and firing shotguns, leaving a trail of bodies. 
They said they learned of the group only after Tuesday's shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``School officials said they had no problems with the two  
suspects, there were no discipline problems,'' Jefferson County 
sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson County District Attorney Dave Thomas said today both  
shooters had a juvenile record, but nothing violent. ``They were 
involved in the same incident, which was theft and trespass to a 
car,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Trenchcoat Mafia members were questioned by police,  
including one who was led away in handcuffs Tuesday. But no arrests 
were made, Davis said, and there was no indication that any of the 
others took part in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly said members of the group made a number of ``generally  
derogatory remarks'' about Hispanics and blacks, and were 
considered outcasts by other students at the school. But officials 
said today that only one of the victims was black. 
</P>
<P>
	They had a long-running feud with some of the school's athletes,  
who enjoyed the popularity the Trenchcoats lacked. 
</P>
<P>
	``A couple of months ago, the jocks were supposed to fight  
them,'' said Matt Good, 16, a football player. But the Trenchcoats 
showed up two hours late, at the wrong spot, carrying swords and 
brass knuckles, and the fight was never rescheduled, Good said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1998 yearbook, a photo showed members of the group  
locking arms and smiling, was accompanied by the caption, ``Who 
says we're different? Insanity's healthy. ... Stay alive, stay 
different, stay crazy!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Morris, a leader of the group, is grinning broadly.  
</P>
<P>
	Klebold's sallow-faced picture appears on a separate page, with  
the statement: ``After going through many experiences in their 
lives, oftentimes students have regrets of past actions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Student Andrew Beard said members of the group often came to  
school in steel-toed combat boots, some of them wearing Nazi 
crosses. Tuesday was the anniversary of Adolf Hitler's birthday, 
and student Aaron Cohn said that was a significant day for 
Trenchcoat members, who would make references to 4-20. He said they 
often made anti-Semitic comments. 
</P>
<P>
	Beard said a dozen students joined the group last year, adopting  
the trademark dusters and sometimes wearing red or green berets, 
but the numbers dwindled to a half-dozen this year as the novelty 
wore off. He said he knew of no special significance for the 
dusters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dylan said he hated the jocks, and how they could walk over  
people and thought they were tough,'' Beard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Josh Nielsen, 17, a junior at the school, said he knew members  
of the group as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``They liked playing war games,'' he said. ``That's all they  
could talk about. They played war games and they liked to re-enact 
World War II battles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks Brown, who said he knew both gunmen, said he was walking  
out of school Tuesday morning when Harris warned him to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was walking out for a cigarette and I told him, `Hey, man'  
and he said, `Brooks, I like you. Now, get out of here. Go home.' 
And so I didn't think twice about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown told The Denver Post he and Harris had made up after a  
feud, but the boy was filled with hate. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did it because he hated people,'' Brown said. ``He loved  
the moment. He loved killing people, he liked that idea. He lived 
in that. That's how I knew it would end the way this did -- kill all 
the hostages and then themselves; I couldn't see anything else.''

<HEADLINE> Report Probes NYC Rapper's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Police suspect jailed music producer Marion  
``Suge'' Knight played a prominent role in the ambush slaying of 
rapper Notorious B.I.G., the Los Angeles Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities declined to give details on what evidence they have  
linking Knight to the killing, the newspaper reported, citing 
unnamed police sources. No charges have been filed against Knight 
in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Notorious B.I.G., whose real name was Christopher Wallace, was  
riding in his GMC Suburban when he was shot several times on March 
9, 1997. He was pronounced dead at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, detectives served search warrants on four locations  
linked to Knight. Police seized a Chevrolet Impala that matches 
witnesses' description of the car used in the drive-by killing, the 
Times said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police also searched the offices of Death Row Records, the  
company Knight founded and built into one of the hottest rap labels 
in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight was in jail at the time of Wallace's death and is  
currently serving a nine-year prison term for violating probation 
in connection with a 1992 attack on two aspiring rappers in a 
Hollywood recording studio. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight's lawyer, David Kenner, declined comment.  
</P>
<P>
	At the time of Wallace's death, rap industry observers had  
acknowledged tensions between Death Row and Wallace's producer, New 
York-based Bad Boys Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace's shooting apparently was payback for previous squabbles  
between the two labels, police sources told the Times. ``This was a 
professional hit,'' one source told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Six months before Wallace's death, rapper Tupac Shakur and  
Knight were in Las Vegas when someone fired on their car. Shakur, 
one of Knight's most successful artists, later died of his 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Police sources told the Times that Knight believes people at Bad  
Boy may have been behind that attack, though a link has never been 
proved. Shakur's shooting has remained unsolved.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Accountability Bill Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans hope to curb the government's  
enthusiasm for new regulations with legislation that would force it 
to calculate how much the rules cost businesses and consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	The government would be required to report each year on the cost  
of red tape under a bill a House Government Reform subcommittee 
approved Tuesday. Its sponsors, Reps. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., and 
David McIntosh, R-Ind., said the measure would increase the federal 
government's accountability and improve the quality of regulatory 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans have a right to know the cumulative costs and  
benefits of federal regulation on these sectors and factors,'' 
McIntosh said. ``Current estimates of the off-budget compliance 
costs imposed on Americans by federal regulatory programs are close 
to $700 billion annually. ... Broken down, that's approximately 
$6,900 for a typical family of four.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The panel approved the bill by voice vote Tuesday over the  
objections of some Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, said the Clinton administration  
has joined labor, environmental, consumer protection and public 
health groups in opposing the bill because it could tie up already 
overburdened government agencies with work that may end up being of 
little value. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill ``would be costly and may cause paralysis by analysis  
and seriously hamper the work of federal government agencies, which 
are mandated to protect the public from adverse consequences and 
certain business practices,'' Kucinich said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, the bill puts too much emphasis on analyzing the  
impact on businesses and others subject to regulation and too 
little on the impact on the people regulations are designed to 
protect, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the bill, the Office of Management and Budget would be  
required to compile accounting statements on the costs of federal 
regulations. Accompanying reports would analyze the impact of 
regulations on the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
	McIntosh, the subcommittee chairman, said the bill should not  
``impose any undue burden on OMB, since much of the needed 
information is already available.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The subcommittee approved a Kucinich amendment that would have  
OMB also look at impacts on public health, public safety, the 
environment, consumer protection, equal opportunity and other 
policy goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., has introduced similar legislation  
in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 1074.

<HEADLINE> Italia Initially Agrees To Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Reassured that Italy's main telephone company  
won't fall under the control of the German government, officials at 
Telecom Italia SpA formally accepted a proposal to merge with 
Deutsche Telekom AG. 
</P>
<P>
	No details of Wednesday's agreement, prompted by Telecom  
Italia's desire to thwart a hostile takeover bid from smaller 
Italian rival Olivetti SpA, were disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal between the two state-cobtrolled companies came  
together after the German government advised the Italian Treasury 
that it would refrain from using its voting rights to dominate the 
activities and corporate structure of the merged business. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed merger would create the world's second-largest  
telecommunications company and may represent the biggest corporate 
marriage in history. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom's board had agreed in principle to the merger on  
Tuesday, but was awaiting clarification on how the German 
government would reduce its controlling interest in what would be 
Europe's biggest telecommunications concern. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom officials in Bonn did not immediately respond  
to phone calls seeking comment on Telecom Italia's approval of the 
merger agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's Finance Ministry, the majority shareholder in Deutsche  
Telekom, had sent a letter to Telecom Italia earlier Wednesday to 
assauge concerns that a merger would amount to a takeover by the 
German government of Italy's flagship phone company. 
</P>
<P>
	``The (German) government's philosophy is not to interfere with  
management decisions'' of privatized companies, ministry spokesman 
Torsten Albig told reporters in Bonn. ``We believe this creates a 
basis for further negotiations between the two companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With combined revenues of about $63 billion, a merged company  
would ranks as the second largest telecommunications firm in the 
world after Japan's NTT, which posted sales last year of $69 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	A merged company could also have a market value of nearly $200  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, Deutsche Telekom has a market capitalization of about  
$117 billion while Telecom Italia is worth about $77 billion. A 
merger of the two could exceed the value of the pending deal 
between Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp., which was worth about $85 
billion based on the Exxon's recent stock price. 
</P>
<P>
	By linking up, the two former state-run monopolies would create  
a telecommunications behemoth that would dwarf its competitors in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	However, several major issues still must be resolved. The  
biggest hurdle appears to be agreement on how the two partners will 
share ownership of the combined company. 
</P>
<P>
	A Telecom Italia official, who spoke by phone from Rome on  
condition of anonymity, said the board decided Tuesday that the 
German government can keep its 72 percent stake in Deutsche 
Telekom, but would need to limit its voting rights after the 
merger. 
</P>
<P>
	The German government's stake is already scheduled to fall to 66  
percent once the Deutsche Telekom issues more stock in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts have speculated that Deutsche Telekom would account for  
between 56 percent and 60 percent of the merged company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian government owns just 3.4 percent of Telecom Italia,  
but its so-called golden share gives it veto power over major 
decisions like mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	One way of closing the ownership gap would be for the German  
government to reduce its voting rights, the Telecom Italia official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	That would enable the German government to avoid a quick sale of  
a sizeable percentage of its shares. The government is prohibited, 
in any case, from selling the bulk of its stake before the end of 
the year.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Rifle Association is trimming its  
Denver conference next week because of the shooting and bombing 
attack that killed 15 people at a suburban high school outside the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest lobbying group for gun owners said the  
meeting will take place in one day, May 1, instead of the planned 
three. Exhibits, festivities, seminars and luncheons surrounding 
the main event will be canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	The tragedy in Littleton ``calls upon us to take steps, along  
with dozens of other public planned events, to modify our schedule 
to show our profound sympathy and respect for the families and 
communities in the Denver area in their time of great loss,'' NRA 
President Charlton Heston and Wayne LaPierre, executive vice 
president, said in a letter to members Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	They said they will still hold the annual meeting for members,  
as required by regulations governing not-for-profit groups. A 
reception for Oklahoma Republican Rep. J.C. Watts also will go 
ahead, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rampage prompted Colorado state lawmakers to kill major gun  
bills, including one that would have helped gun owners obtain 
concealed weapons permits. The bill had already passed the state 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Topics on the NRA's agenda had included ``Methods of Conceal  
Carry,'' ``Dispelling the Myths: Women and Guns'' and ``Why Pay 
Taxes If You Don't Have To?'' Now, the organization will conduct 
its required business and hear from its leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our spirits must endure this terrible suffering together, and  
so must the freedoms that bring us together,'' Heston and LaPierre 
said, encouraging members to attend. ``We must stand in unshakable 
unity, even in this time of anguish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hockey's Colorado Avalanche postponed two playoff games in  
Denver this week, and baseball's Colorado Rockies on Wednesday 
called off their game for the second night in a row.

<HEADLINE> Figures Show Taiwan Economy Rebound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Strong export orders and industrial  
production results for March seem to confirm government claims that 
Taiwan's economy stopped slowing after a tumultuous 1998 and is now 
set for further robust growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Export orders in March rose 3.6 percent compared with the same  
month last year to $10.6 billion, contributing to an overall 2.7 
percent rise in exports over the first quarter of 1999, the 
Economics Ministry said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	More good news seems likely, with exports in the April 1-17  
period up 4.9 percent on the year to $5.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade surplus, meanwhile, expanded to $483 million from $121  
million in the same period a year earlier, the Ministry of Finance 
reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports during the first part of March fell 2.2 percent to $4.9  
billion on year. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade figures point to a rebound in Taiwan's economy, which  
should allow the government to raise its forecast for 1999 economic 
growth next month, said Hsu Kuo-chung, the ministry's director of 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising growth seems certain as the third quarter is  
traditionally Taiwan's peak season for exports, Hsu said. 
</P>
<P>
	Total exports fell 9.4 percent last year, holding economic  
growth to just 4.8 percent, the lowest level since 1982. Export 
orders, which indicate export levels over the three months to come, 
dropped by 4 percent in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, industrial production rose 7.9 percent year-on-year  
in March, the ministry said, contributing to a 5.4 percent rise in 
the first three months of the year from the same period last year.

<HEADLINE> IRS' Tax-Exempt Division Gets Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A veteran federal tax official was named  
Wednesday to head the Internal Revenue Service's new tax-exempt 
division, one of four new operating segments that will serve 
specific groups of taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	Evelyn Petschek, an assistant IRS commissioner since 1996 and a  
Treasury Department tax counsel before that, was selected to 
oversee an IRS division that administers laws affecting religious 
organizations, retirement plans, tax-exempt bonds, governments and 
Indian tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti said headquarters for the Tax  
Exempt Operating Division will be in Washington, D.C., and should 
be up and running by late this year or early 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The other three operating divisions will serve small businesses  
and the self-employed, wage and investment income, and larger 
businesses. The IRS previously has always been organized 
geographically, instead of in operating segments focusing on 
particular taxpayers.

<HEADLINE> Some Heroes Emerge From Tragedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Blood pouring from his chest, William  
``Dave'' Sanders spent the last moments of his life trying to save 
the students he loved. 
</P>
<P>
	The popular business teacher and girls' basketball coach was  
mortally shot as he shepherded panicked students to safety when two 
gunmen scattered bullets and bombs through Columbine High School on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was running back and forth in the cafeteria, telling  
everyone to duck. He saved a lot of people,'' said Sarah Holton, 
16. 
</P>
<P>
	Tearsa Coppfer, 15, a freshman said: ``He was trying to warn  
everybody and get people out, and he got hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders stumbled into a science classroom, coughing blood.  
Frantic students pulled off their T-shirts and pressed the wounds 
to stanch the bleeding. Someone grabbed a phone and called 911. 
They waited for more than three hours before help arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	``He kept saying, `I can't breathe' and `I'm not going to make  
it,''' said Marjorie Lindholm, 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Students gently pulled out Sanders' wallet and held it open so  
he could see the pictures of his wife and daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tell my girls I love them,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, who died at the school, was among dozens of heroes in  
the rampage that left 15 dead. They included students, teachers and 
rescuers who took risks to save others. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our staff at Columbine High School yesterday were heroes,''  
said Rick Kaufman, a Jefferson County School District spokesman. 
``We're hearing stories from students of their bravery. Without 
them, we may have lost a lot more lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the gunfire erupted, the husband-and-wife teaching team of  
Chris and Cheryl Mosier barricaded themselves with their students 
in separate rooms a few doors apart along the same hallway. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicknamed by students as ``Mr. and Mrs. Mo,'' she had about 20  
teen-agers; he had about 50. 
</P>
<P>
	``All these people in our class were hyperventilating and he  
told us to calm down, take deep breaths and breathe into sacks,'' 
said Nicole Appareti, 15, a freshman in Mosier's class. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim Mathewson, 15, said Mrs. Mosier ``was really calm.''  
</P>
<P>
	``For 3 1/2 hours, she kept us quiet and hopeful that we would be  
saved,'' Miss Mathewson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside, frustrated police and sheriff's deputies waited for the  
go-ahead to search for survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, SWAT team members drove an armored vehicle  
underneath a broken library window and pulled a young man to safety 
in a dramatic rescue that was broadcast repeatedly on nationwide 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	Among student heroes were Nick and Adam Foss, 18-year-old twin  
brothers who thought of others first when the gunshot and 
explosions began. 
</P>
<P>
	Nick Foss helped a small group of people into a bathroom while  
his brother helped others into a cramped office near the choir 
room. 
</P>
<P>
	Nick Foss, whose head was nicked by a bullet, and a few other  
students crawled into the ceiling and began moving along heating 
ducts, but Foss plunged through the ceiling, falling on a table 18 
feet below in a teacher's lounge. He got up and ran outside for 
help. 
</P>
<P>
	In the cramped office, Adam Foss had a similar idea. He and a  
few classmates helped others into a crawl space where they could 
breathe easier. ``We kept them as calm as possible,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Students and colleagues say Sanders was a cheerful professional,  
who loved to teach and always had a kind word. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was, I think, the consummate high school coach, the kind of  
person you could tell wanted to win but had the right 
perspective,'' said Arvada West girls' basketball coach Gary 
Anderson, who competed against Sanders' teams. ``He went the extra 
mile for his program.''

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Conflict Takes Toll on Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The economic fallout from the conflict in the  
Balkans extends well beyond burned-out villages in Kosovo and 
abandoned factories in Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	Fears that the strife may spread already have taken a toll on  
Europe's new single currency, the euro, which is limping along at a 
level well below the expectations of its 11 member nations. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, economists see investor confidence fading for  
projects in countries bordering Yugoslavia, and European 
governments face bigger bills to support and resettle a growing 
number of Kosovar refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the best indicators of business confidence in Europe is  
the value of the euro, which has steadily retreated since its 
introduction Jan. 4. Some economists say the turmoil in the Balkans 
is at least partly to blame. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro fell to a new low of $1.0590 during trading Monday and  
was at $1.0610 in New York trading this morning. It rose as high as 
$1.1877 on its first day of trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Neil Parker, an economist at The Royal Bank of Scotland, said  
Tuesday that an erosion in confidence due to the conflict has 
probably shaved 2 1/2 U.S. centsoff the euro's value. The bombing and 
burning is far too close to home, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's undermined confidence and stability in Europe as a  
whole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And while the economic costs have been somewhat limited,  
physical distance from the conflict is no guarantee of immunity 
from its effects. If the euro continues to slump against leading 
world currencies, exporters 1,000 miles away in Britain may soon 
feel a competitive pinch from less expensive goods that are priced 
in euros. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain has chosen not to join the common currency for now.  
</P>
<P>
	``If the value of the euro gets dragged down relative to  
sterling, then that's going to affect the U.K.,'' said Douglas 
Godden of the Confederation of British Industry, an employers' 
lobbying group. 
</P>
<P>
	Nations paying the highest price are those closest to the  
conflict. Hungary, Bulgaria and other countries that depend on 
waterways for much of their trade have suffered disruptions in 
growth since the Danube River was closed to commerce, said Glenn 
Davis, chief economist at Credit Lyonnais U.K. 
</P>
<P>
	The fighting has also discouraged Western investors.  
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people have been very badly burned in Asia, Latin  
America and Russia over the last few years, and you're going to 
look very stupid if you put money into a war situation,'' Davis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Germany, Europe's economic linchpin, the effects of the  
Kosovo crisis have been mild so far. 
</P>
<P>
	But Germany has already accepted 10,000 refugees from Kosovo,  
and payments for additional humanitarian efforts could eventually 
put pressure on a federal budget already stretched by the costs of 
integrating the former communist East Germany, said Thomas Mayer, a 
Frankfurt-based economist for the investment bank Goldman Sachs. 
</P>
<P>
	Other countries likely to become destinations for displaced  
Kosovars -- Italy, Austria and Switzerland -- could come under 
similar budgetary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and Britain, which have contributed the  
largest forces to the military campaign against Yugoslavia, have 
seen their leadership roles translate into a strengthening of their 
respective currencies. Parker of the Royal Bank of Scotland said 
this trend is a function of short-term euphoria more than financial 
logic. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders seeking a safe haven for funds have also bid up the  
value of the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
	If the conflict drags on into the summer, governments may have  
to consider cutting spending or, a less likely prospect, raising 
taxes, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	But not everyone is feeling economic pain.  
</P>
<P>
	Exporters based in Germany and elsewhere in the countries that  
share the euro are likely to benefit from a cheaper euro when they 
try to sell in overseas markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense-related industries may profit from NATO's need to  
replenish stocks of cruise missiles and other high-tech ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
	``It depends on how good the Serbs are at shooting down NATO  
planes,'' said Malcolm House, an economist at the Federation of the 
Electronics Industry, a London-based trade association. 
</P>
<P>
	And in the long run, companies that make constructions materials  
and consumer goods might be in a position to profit once Serbs and 
Kosovars begin rebuilding their lives.

<HEADLINE> Blues Blue-Liners Concern Coyotes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Nobody concerns the Phoenix Coyotes like St.  
Louis defensemen Al MacInnis and Chris Pronger, with good reason. 
The two seem to always be on the ice, and they cause headaches for 
opponents at both ends of the rink. 
</P>
<P>
	MacInnis took more shots (314) this season than all but three  
other players -- all forwards -- and scored goals on 20, including 11 
on the power play. He got enough assists on rebounds to lead NHL 
defensemen in scoring with 62 points. Pronger teamed with him to 
give the Blues a matchless pair at the blue line. 
</P>
<P>
	Pronger also shadows the other team's best scorer, and that  
means a rematch with Keith Tkachuk in the first game of the 
Blues-Coyotes first-round playoff series Thursday night in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Pronger had career highs in goals (13), assists (33) and points.  
He also spent more time on the ice than anyone in the league, 
averaging 30.61 minutes, and MacInnis was fourth at 29.12. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Blues beat Phoenix 6-4 on April 15 to win the season  
series 2-1-1, they scored four power-play goals. Pronger had one 
and an assist, and MacInnis had three assists. 
</P>
<P>
	``They both have hard shots, and it seems like they can put them  
on the net through traffic,'' Phoenix goaltender Nikolai Khabibulin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tkachuk, a career-long left wing being moved to center because  
of Jeremy Roenick's injuries, doesn't feel centering for Dallas 
Drake and Shane Doan will be much different. Perhaps that's because 
he knows the 6-foot-6, 220-pound Pronger will be there no matter 
where he lines up. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to get one of the two best defensemen in the  
league,'' Tkachuk said. ``MacInnis will probably get the Norris 
Trophy, and Pronger's tough to play against. He plays it hard, he 
plays it physical, and he's got such a long reach it's tough to 
beat him one-on-one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pronger's take on the matchup was equally complimentary: ``Any  
time you get to play against an elite player it's a lot of fun and 
it makes for a lot of competition and emotional play, and I think 
that's what fans pay to watch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the coaches don't expect things to remain cordial.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think the emotion will come out immediately,'' Blues coach  
Joel Quenneville said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it'll take too long,'' said Jim Schoenfeld of  
the Coyotes. ``They're both highly competitive and they're both 
nasty competitors; they have a mean streak and they have a lot of 
courage, and it will be battle worth watching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Coyotes finished fourth in the Western Conference and have  
home ice for this series. But they lost five in a row before a 
victory in their final game gave them 90 points for the second time 
in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues knocked Anaheim out of fifth by going the other  
direction -- posting a 6-1-2 record in April and winning their last 
four road games. 
</P>
<P>
	They also got forward Geoff Courtnall back for the last three  
games of the regular season after he missed 57 games with an 
injury, and the Coyotes played their last two without Roenick, who 
needed reconstructive surgery on his jaw after a hit by Derian 
Hatcher of Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Throw in the Winnipeg-Phoenix record of playoff futility -- the  
franchise has been eliminated in the first round its last seven 
times in the playoffs, and 11 of 13 times overall -- and it looks 
like a waltz for St. Louis. But the Blues, who swept Los Angeles in 
the first round last April, are cautious. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get in the playoffs, you never know what can  
happen,'' center Pierre Turgeon said. ``They're a good team. You 
look at Tkachuk and those guys, and they're a great hockey team. We 
can't be saying they're going to be easy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues won their only playoff meeting 3-1 in 1982, Winnipeg's  
first postseason. But the Coyotes can take hope in knowing the Jets 
got past the first round in 1984-85, when they had 96 points, and 
1986-87, when they had 88, their second-best total until this 
season.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Fails To Oust Top Prosecutor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- President Boris Yeltsin failed again Wednesday in  
his months-long bid to oust Russia's top prosecutor when 
parliament's upper house refused to approve his dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor General Yuri Skuratov's supporters portray him as a  
crusader for rooting out alleged bribe-taking in the Kremlin, while 
his opponents say he's the one who's corrupt. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin is eager to see Skuratov go, but he can't boot out the  
prosecutor just by signing an order, as the president has 
frequently done with Cabinet ministers and Kremlin aides. 
</P>
<P>
	The removal of Russia's prosecutor general must be approved by  
the upper house of parliament, the Federation Council. And after a 
rancorous, all-day session Wednesday, the house voted 79-61 to keep 
Skuratov in his job. 
</P>
<P>
	Skuratov left the house floor smiling. Asked whether he had  
plans to meet with Yeltsin, he said, ``It's up to the president. 
I'm not going to ask him for anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's vote was the second time the Federation Council --  
once considered quite loyal to Yeltsin -- refused to fire Skuratov. 
Lawmakers rejected his ouster last month after Skuratov told them 
he was under pressure because of his investigation into alleged 
Kremlin corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin responded by suspending Skuratov. But that decision was  
legally questionable, and Wednesday's vote leaves it unclear 
whether Skuratov can return to work. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin has argued the prosecutor should be dismissed on moral  
grounds, since the release of a videotape allegedly showing 
Skuratov having sex with two prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin, who has a little more than a year left in office, has  
been weakened in recent months by corruption scandals, an 
impeachment probe and repeated illness. 
</P>
<P>
	The president reacted ``calmly'' to parliament's refusal  
Wednesday to dismiss Skuratov, presidential spokesman Dmitry 
Yakushkin was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Federation Council speaker Yegor Stroyev said Yeltsin may again  
ask the house to consider Skuratov's dismissal, and suggested 
trying to work out a compromise with the president. 
</P>
<P>
	At the start of Wednesday's debate, Yeltsin's chief of staff,  
Alexander Voloshin, read a letter in which the president implored 
the Federation Council to fire Skuratov. 
</P>
<P>
	But Federation Council members quickly cut Voloshin off,  
demanding that he tell them what Skuratov had done to deserve 
losing his job. 
</P>
<P>
	Skuratov has sought to portray himself as a prosecutor who wants  
to root out corruption. His Kremlin probe has focused on alleged 
bribe-taking by top government officials responsible for awarding 
large construction contracts to the Swiss company Mabetex. 
</P>
<P>
	Kremlin officials and Mabetex have denied any wrongdoing, and no  
one has been charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say Skuratov has done little to prosecute corruption  
cases in his four years as Prosecutor General and is only doing so 
now to save his job. 
</P>
<P>
	Skuratov is also under a separate investigation himself.  
Authorities are checking to see if criminal suspects provided 
Skuratov with the women in the videotape in return for his dropping 
investigations against them.

<HEADLINE> Bengals' Smith Decides on Football </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Akili Smith is a top NFL draft pick and a  
millionaire in the making because he couldn't hit a curve ball. 
</P>
<P>
	For three years, Smith swung and missed on baseball fields  
across Florida and New York, prompting him to give up the sport for 
football. From that failure has come tremendous success. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cincinnati Bengals took him with the third overall pick in  
the NFL draft last weekend, making him as their quarterback of the 
future. As he looks back, Smith marvels at how it has turned out. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I could have hit a curve ball, I probably wouldn't be  
sitting here right now,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Until a few years ago, he figured his path to pro sports would  
go through a baseball diamond. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pittsburgh Pirates made him their seventh-round draft pick  
in 1993. He was a catcher at Lincoln High School in San Diego and 
thought his strong arm could move him along through the farm 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	His first season for Bradenton in the Gulf Coast Rookie League  
was a shock. He hit only .200, striking out 18 times in 95 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	Things got even worse the next year, when he went back to  
Bradenton and hit .174, striking out 18 times in 69 at-bats. 
Finally, after hitting .125 for the Erie Seawolves in the New 
York-Penn League, he realized he was like the thousands of other 
kids who show up dreaming of the majors and wind up not even coming 
close. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just couldn't hit the offspeed pitch,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	There was another problem: his throwing. The Pirates moved him  
to the outfield but didn't like the way he got rid of the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	He threw like a quarterback.  
</P>
<P>
	``In baseball, you've got to have a longer throwing motion,'' he  
said. ``I kind of threw with football mechanics. I was a little 
upset because I wanted to play catcher. I guess they didn't think I 
was capable of doing that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 62 games in the minors weren't a total loss. He learned a  
lot on those bus rides to get to them. Those lessons carried over 
when he went back to college and played quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``In baseball, you've got to be able to play day-in and  
day-out,'' he said. ``You take bus rides to God knows where for 
three or four hours. As soon as you get off the bus, you've got to 
take infield practice, batting practice and stuff like that. In 
football, you've got a week to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
	``That helped me mature a lot. I was 17 years old and away from  
home and I wasn't making the right decisions day-in and day-out 
because I wasn't mentally prepared. But now that I'm 23 and looking 
back on that, it's going to help me with what I have to deal with 
now in Cincinnati.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Cincinnati, he's got the task of trying to turn around a team  
that's gone 3-13 four times in the 1990s, has gone through 10 
quarterbacks in the decade and hasn't had a winning record since 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a team that desperately needs someone to lead. Smith, who  
loved being a catcher because he was the focal point, is ready to 
try. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're the catcher, you're totally in charge,'' he said.  
``It's the same way with the quarterback. Hopefully I can step in 
there and become an instant leader.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals like that about him.  
</P>
<P>
	``Akili is an outgoing, positive guy,'' general manager Mike  
Brown said. ``We like his confidence, we like his buoyant, upbeat 
personality. He's fun to be around. He's assertive. He's got real 
goals when it comes to football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And this time, he doesn't have to hit the curve ball.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Plans To Enter Local Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *BY DOUG JOHNSON   	
</P>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. says it plans to enter the local  
telephone market in New York by leasing phones lines from Bell 
Atlantic Corp., a move observers say should benefit consumers by 
ending the Bell company's near-monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
	If the move gains approval from federal and state regulators, it  
would make New York one of the few areas open to large-scale local 
phone competition. It could also allow Bell Atlantic to offer long 
distance service, further adding to competition in that market. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T plans to offer local and long distance service -- the first  
time it has done that on a large scale since the government broke 
up its own phone monopoly in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	A company spokesman said combining the services means AT&AMP;T could  
offer lower prices and unified billing -- now available only on a 
limited basis in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our customers have been telling us for years that they want  
their phone bill on a single bill, so the sooner we can do that the 
better,'' said Gary Morganstern. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic and the other regional phone companies are  
required by federal law to open their local markets to competition 
before they can get into the lucrative long distance business. So 
far, that hasn't happened. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of local phone competition hope it will lead to lower  
prices -- just like the 70 percent drop in long distance charges 
that occurred in the 1980s after competition was introduced. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll have telephone companies fighting turf battles that  
they have never had to fight before,'' James Smith, a 
telecommunications consultant and professor at the State University 
of New York in New Paltz. ``We could see long-distance calls drop 
to about a nickel a minute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morganstern said AT&AMP;T hopes to start offering local service  
through Bell Atlantic's lines by the end of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	It wouldn't be the first time the long-distance giant sought  
local-service customers in the state. In fact, AT&AMP;T dropped its 
efforts in 1996 to lease local lines because of the high cost. 
</P>
<P>
	But, Morganstern said, the time is right to try again now that  
Bell Atlantic is offering to lease lines at a deep discount as part 
of its plan to win regulatory permission to enter the long-distance 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are giving us discounts on their phone lines of 45 to 50  
percent, which makes it economically viable to try out the market 
again,'' Morganstern said. ``As long as they (Bell Atlantic's 
lines) work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morganstern said AT&AMP;T is waiting until later this year to lease  
the lines because of concerns with a number of flaws recently found 
in Bell Atlantic's operating systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The flaws could mean problems in the future with Bell Atlantic's  
ability to handle customers who want to switch companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``If these material failures aren't corrected, they will result  
in horrendously poor service levels,'' said Michael Morrissey, 
AT&AMP;T's vice president of law and government affairs for New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic officials say they want more than anyone else to  
correct any flaws. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic hired a consulting firm, KPMG Peat Marwick, to  
test its computer systems to determine if they could work easily 
with competitors' systems. Last week, Bell Atlantic filed a report 
with the state Public Service Commission saying it passed 90 
percent of the tests. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T says it's yet satisfied.  
</P>
<P>
	``Can you imagine flying in an airplane with only 90 percent of  
its parts in place?'' Morganstern asked. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Bell Atlantic said the company has proven that  
its network is open to competitors, and AT&AMP;T's desire to enter into 
the local phone market reinforces that. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of AT&AMP;T's strategy to offer local phone service nationwide  
involves use of cable television lines, not leasing phone lines 
from local Bells. 
</P>
<P>
	That was one reason AT&AMP;T bought cable operator  
Tele-Communications Inc. But TCI has few cable TV lines in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to enter the local phone market as soon as we can,''  
Morganstern said. ``We know that Bell Atlantic will eventually pass 
the tests, it's just a matter of waiting for that to happen.''

<HEADLINE> IOC Member to Congress: Butt Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- An influential IOC member thinks the  
U.S. Congress should mind its own business about reforming the 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain wrote this week to IOC president Juan Antonio  
Samaranch and said Congress questions whether the IOC will enact 
``comprehensive and meaningful reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Gosper of the International Olympic committee rejected  
calls by Congress for monthly updates on reform. He said the IOC 
should make its own changes without outside suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we have any responsibility to report to the  
Senate committee on an ongoing basis,'' Gosper told a Foreign 
Correspondents Association luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know any international corporations doing (that). I  
don't know any U.S. corporations doing it, and don't know why we 
should be asked to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's Senate Commerce Committee investigated the Olympic  
bribery scandal in which 10 IOC members have resigned or been 
expelled amid accusations of vote-buying for Salt Lake City's 
successful 2002 bid to hold the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper, a member of the IOC ethics commission, said his group  
has no obligation to deliver monthly updates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am surprised he (McCain) didn't give us more credit and I am  
surprised that some of his members suggested that putting in place 
the ethics commission ... is not seen as more than a public 
relations exercise,'' Gosper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC ignored the recommendations of an ethics panel headed by  
former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell. McCain thinks the 
IOC is not moving quickly enough on restructuring and contends the 
whole process of reform goes through Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper said Samaranch has the support of IOC members.  
</P>
<P>
	``When the ship gets into trouble, you don't rush up to the  
captain's cabin and throw him overboard,'' he said. ``In fact, you 
rush up to make sure he doesn't jump overboard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper said he sees no requirement for the IOC to adopt the  
reforms suggested by the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a simple oversight to say that because a high proportion  
of the corporations that sponsor and work as partners are from the 
United States, then all the money comes from the United States and 
the United States must have a key say in all events,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics committee, composed mostly of non-IOC members, meets  
for the first time May 3. The IOC board meets the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper also said the investigation into Australian IOC member  
Phil Coles probably will be handed to the ethics commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, reprimanded after the Salt Lake investigation, is accused  
of accepting $6,300 worth of jewelry in connection with Athens' 
failed bid for the 1996 Olympics.

<HEADLINE>  15 Dead in Colorado School Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Worried about bombs and booby traps,  
specially trained officers painstakingly checked thousands of 
lockers and castoff backpacks today in a suburban high school where 
15 people were killed. Close to 30 explosive devices were found. 
</P>
<P>
	Victims' bodies were left in the school overnight as agonized  
parents braced for the worst. Students streamed into Clement Park 
next to the school early today to leave flowers and share their 
feelings about the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helps to talk about it,'' said Brandon Reisbeck, a  
19-year-old senior who bolted from his choir class to safety after 
he heard gunshots Tuesday. Outside the Light of the World Church, 
visitors placed flowers and cards at the base of a weathered 
12-foot cross leaning sideways against a tree. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the worst of the school shooting rampages that have  
shocked the nation in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation was delayed by the thorough police sweep of  
the school, which was prompted by the discovery of bombs in the 
parking lot and on the bodies of the gunmen, said to be members of 
an outcast group with right-wing overtones called the Trenchcoat 
Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
	At midmorning today, sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said close  
to 30 explosive devices were found at the school, in the suspects' 
vehicles and possibly at their homes. Late Tuesday, more than 11 
hours after the shootings, a bomb on a timer blew up, but no one 
was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of these devices are on timing devices, some are  
incendiary devices and some are pipe bombs,'' Jefferson County 
Sheriff John Stone told ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' ``Some are 
like hand grenades that have got shrapnel in them wrapped around 
butane containers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After hours of confusion on the precise death toll, Davis put it  
at 15, including the two shooters. Four of the dead were women or 
girls, and at least one was believed to be a school staff member, 
he said. At one point, authorities had said up to 25 had died. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the victims were found underneath desks, in cubicles or  
in boxes, slain while apparently trying to hide, Davis said. 
Witnesses said that during the rampage, the two teen-agers in black 
trench coats laughed and hooted as they opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, students struggled to understand the tragedy.  
</P>
<P>
	Crystal Woodman, a junior who was in the library when the gunmen  
burst in, said this morning she can't get their voices out of her 
head. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were just, like, they thought it was funny,'' Woodman  
told ``Good Morning America.'' ``They were just, like `Who's next? 
Who's ready to die?' They were just, like, `We've waited to do this 
our whole lives.' And every time they'd shoot someone, they'd 
holler, like it was, like, exciting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the bodies were found in the library. The attackers  
marched in with guns and pipe bombs, demanding that ``all jocks 
stand up. We're going to kill every one of you,'' student Aaron 
Cohn said. 
</P>
<P>
	A gunman looked under a desk in the library and said  
``Peek-a-boo,'' then fired, Cohn said. Anyone who cried or moaned 
was shot again. One girl begged for her life, but a gunshot ended 
her cries. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohn said one killer put a pistol to his head but did not shoot  
him. Instead, he said, the shooter turned his attention to a black 
student, saying, ``I hate niggers.'' Cohn heard three shots but 
couldn't see what happened. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, frantic parents awaited word of their children,  
watching as busloads of tearful students were reunited with their 
families. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-three people were treated at hospitals, most of them with  
gunshot wounds. Sixteen teens remained hospitalized this morning, 
including five in critical condition and five others in serious 
condition. One teen suffered at least nine shrapnel and bullet 
wounds; she was in fair condition today. 
</P>
<P>
	Students and Denver media identified the gunmen as Eric Harris  
and Dylan Klebold. The two exchanged shots with police and were 
later found dead in the library with self-inflicted gunshot wounds 
and bombs around their bodies, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears to be a suicide mission,'' Stone said.  
</P>
<P>
	Both youths had two parents at home and came from families  
neighbors described as fine people. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were extremely bright, but not good students,'' said  
choir teacher Lee Andres. ``... They disliked authority. They did 
not like to be told what to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the motive was unclear, several students said Harris and  
Klebold were members of a group calling itself the ``Trenchcoat 
Mafia,'' outcasts who bragged about guns and bombs and hated blacks 
and Hispanics, as well as athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Police who searched Harris' home said they found bomb-making  
material. Students said the group was fascinated with World War II 
and the Nazis and noted that Tuesday was Adolf Hitler's birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair, wearing fatigues and ankle-length black coats, opened  
fire in the parking lot around 11:30 a.m. before entering the 
school cafeteria. Bullets ricocheted off lockers as students raced 
toward the exits. 
</P>
<P>
	Student Nick Foss saw one of the gunmen pull a sawed-off shotgun  
from under his coat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Finally I started figuring out these guys shot to kill for no  
reason,'' Foss said. The gunman ``didn't say anything. When he 
looked at me, the guy's eyes were just dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The killers fired as they walked into the cafeteria and  
continued shooting as they moved upstairs into the library. Cohn 
said he heard one girl begging for her life and then a bang. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were laughing after they shot. It was like they were  
having the time of their life,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of students hid in classrooms before escaping with the  
help of police in an armored car. Others were trapped for hours 
while SWAT teams searched for the gunmen and their bombs. Some had 
called their parents on cellular phones from inside the building to 
whisper they were OK. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of police officers from throughout the Denver area  
surrounded the school, which has 1,800 students. As TV images of 
the scene were broadcast nationwide, helicopter ambulances used a 
sports field as a landing pad, and officers in helmets and 
camouflage gear took cover behind squad cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Students who fled the building wept and held their hands above  
their heads while police frisked them. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, President Clinton said: ``Perhaps now America  
will wake up to the dimensions of this challenge, if it could 
happen in a place like Littleton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At an appearance today in Minneapolis, Attorney General Janet  
Reno said she may push to have more counselors in the nation's 
schools to avoid problems before they start. ``It is important for 
teachers, parents ... to have the resources they need to turn to,'' 
Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
	Littleton is a suburb of 35,000 southwest of Denver, where  
farmland is rapidly disappearing beneath suburban sprawl and soccer 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
	Many parents gathered at a nearby elementary school and answered  
questions from investigators, who were trying to identify some of 
the victims based only on what they were wearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauri Senti waited 3 1/2 hours before she found her 14-year-old  
daughter, Ashley Steele, safe. Senti stayed at Leawood Elementary 
until late Tuesday to comfort other grieving parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody was walking around asking if you'd heard about their  
children,'' she said. ``You can't really say anything. You're just 
there for support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1997, a series of school shootings around the country have  
led to demands for stricter laws, tighter security and closer 
monitoring of troubled students. Two people were killed in an 
attack in Pearl, Miss., three in West Paducah, Ky., five in 
Jonesboro, Ark., and two in Springfield, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 1, 1966, University of Texas student Charles Whitman  
climbed to the top of the campus clock tower and opened fire with a 
high-powered rifle. He killed 14 people and wounded more than 30 
before he was shot to death by lawmen. Authorities also discovered 
the bodies of Whitman's wife and mother in their homes.

<HEADLINE> Starr Promotes Three Staff Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Kenneth Starr promoted three of his  
prosecutors, signaling that the Washington branch of his five-year 
investigation of President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, won't be 
shutting down anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
	The appointment of deputies Jay Apperson, Edward J. Page and  
Michael Emmick follows the departure of prosecutors who left as the 
Monica Lewinsky investigation wound down. 
</P>
<P>
	Emmick was the lead prosecutor assigned to try to persuade the  
former White House intern to cooperate with Starr's office in her 
initial encounter with investigators on Jan. 16, 1998, in a hotel 
near Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Apperson is lead counsel in the prosecution of longtime Clinton  
friend Webster Hubbell for allegedly concealing his own and Hillary 
Rodham Clinton's roles in a fraudulent Arkansas land development. 
</P>
<P>
	Page went to Starr's office from the staff of another  
independent counsel, David Barrett, who is prosecuting former 
Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros. Before that, Page spent eight 
years with the U.S. attorney's office in Tampa, Fla., where he was 
chief of the major crimes section. 
</P>

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- In an April 14 story, The Associated Press  
erroneously reported that a lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties 
Union seeks to stop public schools, military bases and other 
publicly funded organizations from allowing Boy Scout troops to 
meet as long as the scouts insist on a religious oath. 
</P>
<P>
	The ACLU's lawsuit seeks to stop such organizations from  
sponsoring Boy Scout troops and spending tax dollars on them as 
long as the scouts require the oath.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- At first glance, he's living an unexceptional  
Chamber of Commerce existence: league bowling on the weekends, 
singing in a barbershop quartet and operating the best-known 
convenience store in metropolitan Springfield, USA. 
</P>
<P>
	But Apu Nahasapeemapetilon has a darker side: the chutney  
Squishees he once tried to force upon an unsuspecting populace. His 
role in the off-off-off-off-off-Broadway production of 
``Streetcar!'' (liberally adapted from Tennessee Williams). The 
flash-frozen senior citizen who once inhabited his dairy case. 
</P>
<P>
	You know Apu. He's a lot like you and me -- his successes pinned  
proudly to his polyester Kwik-E Mart frock, his failures stashed 
furtively under the counter behind the food-service cans of 
Reagan-era nacho cheese. 
</P>
<P>
	Except Apu exists only in a cosmos of pen and ink, of bright  
yellows and popping eyes. He's a member of an unusual animated 
flock, sprung from the mind of an even more unusual genius: the man 
whose brain produced ``The Simpsons'' -- and the new sci-fi cartoon 
``Futurama''; the man whose pointed humor has, for more than a 
decade, made lots of people laugh and lots of people uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have a particular ax to grind,'' he insists.  
</P>
<P>
	So instead, with smiles and jabs and idealism and sarcasm, Matt  
Groening grinds them all. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Utterances by Homer Simpson, fatty foods aficionado, errant  
nuclear-plant employee and incompetent if loving father: 
</P>
<P>
	--''I used to rock and roll all night and party every day. Then  
it was every other day. Now I'm lucky if I can find half an hour a 
week in which to get funky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--''Maybe, for once, someone will call me `sir' without adding,  
`You're making a scene.''' 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``Ooh! Barbecue!''  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	One day, somewhere in the middle of the baby boom, a young boy  
in a sandbox looked around at his playmates. Suddenly, he saw their 
futures: lawyers, investment bankers, grown-ups in grown-up suits. 
And Matt Groening realized being a kid wasn't such a bad gig. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew that other kids were going to get serious and go on and  
be professionals,'' says Groening (rhymes with ``raining''). ``I 
never wanted to go to an office and carry a briefcase. I said, 
`That's no fun. I want to play. I want to make up stories.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Four decades later, at 45, he still does.  
</P>
<P>
	He made up ``Life in Hell,'' a weekly comic strip that  
chronicles the travails of a rabbit named Binky and a nihilistic 
gay couple in fez hats named Akbar and Jeff. He created ``The 
Simpsons,'' the delightfully astute late 20th-century family sitcom 
and a winner of 12 Emmys. Now he has hatched ``Futurama,'' an 
equally offbeat cartoon that blends ``The Simpsons'' with ``The 
Jetsons,'' ``The Three Stooges'' and a hodgepodge of sci-fi 
imagery. 
</P>
<P>
	Groening's vision, rounded out by a team of animators and  
writers from across the political spectrum, evokes many 
descriptions: absurdist theater; crackling cultural commentary; a 
vast collage of American pop and high culture; the rapid-fire 
dialogue of Marx Brothers movies and the lunacy of Warner Bros. 
cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardly Saturday-morning ``Josie &AMP; the Pussycats'' or ``Smurfs''  
fare. View an episode of ``The Simpsons'' and watch the background. 
Little treats abound -- rewards, Groening says, for paying 
attention. Hidden in plain view are indictments of consumerism, 
jabs at bureaucracy and pokes at pretension. It is, quite simply, 
adult. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider these recent nuggets: an art museum named ``Louvre --  
American Style'' (``No shirt, no shoes, no Chardonnay''); an 
unrepentantly carnivorous steakhouse with a slab of beef called 
``Sir Loinalot'' and a Heimlich machine in case of emergency; a 
sign that says, ``Welcome to Atlanta -- Home of Ted Turner's mood 
swings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Groening and his writers (his official title is executive  
producer, but he retains great creative control) push to the edge 
of hilarity but never complete implausibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of television shows ... don't deal with the things  
people are ashamed to admit. We can do that,'' says Dan 
Castellaneta, who voices Homer Simpson and an array of other 
characters, including belching barfly Barney Gumble and 
flame-bearded, Scottish-brogued Groundskeeper Willie. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the first television show that has an underground comic  
sensibility,'' Castellaneta says in a decidedly un-Homeric voice. 
``Very rarely do people talk about major corporations and companies 
taking away people's rights. In `The Simpsons,' it just sneaks in 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the exclusionary in-jokes of ``Seinfeld,'' Groening's  
work is both accessible and deliciously obscure: Baby Maggie's 
attempt to break out of a day-care center would be hilarious even 
if it didn't feature the theme from ``The Great Escape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ridiculing mass media is a ``Simpsons'' staple. Local TV news is  
skewered with glee, as are violent cartoons: ``The Itchy and 
Scratchy Show,'' a cat-and-mouse cartoon within a cartoon, features 
graphic dismemberment and titles like ``Scar Trek: The Next 
Laceration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even Groening's own network isn't safe. One episode featured  
Homer and Bart watching ``Nonstop Fox,'' featuring ``When Buildings 
Collapse'' and ``World's Funniest Tornados.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what we all share is laughing at the Elmer Fudds of  
the world -- authorities who don't like to be laughed at,'' Groening 
says of his writers. 
</P>
<P>
	This notion -- that no cow is sacred -- renders the Simpsons  
affectionately benign. Sure, Apu is a broad parody of an Indian 
convenience-store owner, but Homer is an equally broad parody of a 
second-rate suburban white American father. In the end, everybody's 
good, everybody's bad and everybody's a bit ridiculous -- sort of 
like real life. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes you reflect and say, `Yeah -- that's me too. I've been  
there,''' says Cherie Kerr, a founding member of the Groundlings, 
the West Coast comedy troupe that has produced such favorite 
``Simpsons'' guest voices as Jon Lovitz and the late Phil Hartman. 
``But it's in an animated form, and that makes it less 
in-your-face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such humor is bound to raise hackles, though, and producers of  
``The Simpsons'' have become accustomed to strong reactions; last 
month's episode of Simpsons-spun Bible stories elicited more. 
</P>
<P>
	Early on, Bart annoyed people most; schoolteachers said his  
``underachiever and proud of it'' attitude fostered mediocrity and 
rebelliousness. Now, Homer's bathetic travails dominate the show 
and he has become a target. U.S. Rep. Joseph Pitts, a conservative 
Pennsylvania Republican, recently blamed Homer and his ilk for 
contributing to the decline of fatherhood in America. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are really missing the boat on this,'' says Robert  
Thompson, director of the Center for the Study of Popular 
Television at Syracuse University. ``If I had a choice between an 
8-year-old watching a literate, artistic, densely packed comedy 
like the Simpsons or one of these supposedly friendly, 
family-oriented `TGIF' programs like `Full House,' tell me which is 
worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Simpsons could serve for a kid today what Mad magazine did  
for me,'' Thompson says. ``It awakened a political consciousness, 
made me realize I could read something and have an opinion about it 
-- all the useful intellectual tools you get from reading satire.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

	Signs seen around Springfield:  
</P>

</P>

<P>
	Lisa and Maggie are his sisters, Homer and Marge his parents. He  
favors sarcasm and cutting repartee, but his mischief is 
good-natured. He distrusts authority. He seems forever young. 
</P>
<P>
	Not Bart. Matt.  
</P>
<P>
	Groening, who names characters after relatives (``Life in Hell''  
also features his sons, Will and Abe, depicted as rabbits), says he 
aimed to create a universe where people screw up but must rely upon 
each other to survive, where ``you can have a great life if you're 
second best -- or in Homer's case, in last place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The characters in `The Simpsons' love their lives, and Homer  
loves his life more than anyone,'' Groening says on a recent day 
from the Los Angeles offices of ``Futurama.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He follows his passions 100 percent. It gets him into a lot of  
trouble, but there's a part of us that wishes we had the guts to be 
like Homer and really savor that doughnut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Savoring, whether doughnuts or life, is what Groening's work is  
about. He still can't believe he's making a living at an activity 
that people warned would be his downfall. 
</P>
<P>
	During high school in the late 1960s and early '70s, the  
Portland, Ore., native watched as music and film and underground 
comics flourished. He absorbed popular culture like a sheet of 
Bounty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a perfect age to turn out the way I did,'' Groening says.  
</P>
<P>
	After college, he photocopied his own cartoon magazine, ``Life  
in Hell.'' It became his first success and today is syndicated 
nationally. He got his world view moving from job to job: 
record-store clerk, movie extra, chauffeur and dishwasher -- ``the 
standard stuff you do when you're trying to live by your wits and 
nobody's hiring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1987, Tracey Ullman enlisted Groening to do a few shorts  
about a dysfunctional family called the Simpsons for her variety 
show. Those first tries were rough, angular versions of the 
rounded-out family we know today. 
</P>
<P>
	The humor stuck, and the Simpsons' own show debuted in December  
1989 and became a regular series the following month. It succeeded 
in part because Groening, a media junkie, drew from myriad cultural 
sources -- high, middle and lowbrow -- for his humor. Everybody 
understood something. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything he likes, he's willing to twist into his version,''  
says longtime collaborator David X. Cohen, co-executive producer of 
``Futurama,'' which debuted last month with a similar sensibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``Futurama,'' as absurdist and caustic as ``The Simpsons,'' is  
more ambitious. Groening and Cohen wanted to create a distinctive 
future that could accommodate both comedy and science fiction. But 
how to design it? A happy, cornball Jetsons utopia or a dark, 
drippy, smelly ``Blade Runner'' landscape? 
</P>
<P>
	They compromised.  
</P>
<P>
	``We decided it should be a dark, drippy, cartoony, smelly  
Jetsons utopia,'' Cohen says. 
</P>
<P>
	Like much sci-fi, ``Futurama'' deals with other times and  
places, making sensitive issues seem more oblique than in the 
Simpsons. As Katey Sagal puts it, ``there is no politically correct 
in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sagal (``Married ... With Children'') voices Leela, the  
tough-but-sexy alien ship captain in ``Futurama.'' Despite her 
large and only eye, Leela is a 31st-century woman balancing career 
and love. Fry (Billy West, who voiced both Ren and Stimpy) is a 
pizza delivery boy cryogenically frozen for a millennium, coping 
with a not-so-brave new world. Together with a cast of 
neo-Springfieldian oddballs, they face life. 
</P>
<P>
	Theirs is a cosmos ruled by DOOP (the Democratic Order of  
Planets), where a wisecracking alcoholic robot lives among humans, 
the moon is a theme park and New Yorkers commute in pneumatic 
tubes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Futurama'' has its melancholy side, too: Fry walks through  
what was Manhattan's Rockefeller Center and sees the ancient ruins 
of his 20th-century world. His face falls. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's just this human quality to everybody, this  
vulnerability,'' Sagal says. 
</P>
<P>
	With all the famous voices ``The Simpsons'' has featured, from  
Paul McCartney to Rod Steiger to Michelle Pfeiffer, Groening 
anticipates and welcomes celebrity appearances on ``Futurama.'' One 
catch: This is an era where famous people's brains are kept alive 
in a disembodied head museum. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ``Futurama'' premiere, Leonard Nimoy's voice speaks from  
his pickled head; he tells of living ``a life of quiet dignity,'' 
then sucks up some fish food dropped into his tank. The year 3000 
version of ``New Year's Rockin' Eve'' appears on TV -- with Dick 
Clark's head as host. 
</P>
<P>
	And a couple of craniums down from Richard Nixon's sits a jar  
containing the face of a bearded, bewildered-looking man. The jar's 
plaque, visible for only a micromoment, says ``Matt Groening'' -- 
another little reward for those paying attention. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
	Prime time today is stuffed with cartoons, from the mordant  
``Family Guy'' to the suburb-skewering ``King of the Hill'' to the 
cubicle-bound nerdfest ``Dilbert.'' And ``The Simpsons'' has helped 
pave the way. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Groening has managed to blend humor and substance into  
something rare -- a world full of flawed characters easy to care 
about, each with a specific personality, from Apu to Homer, from 
Cletus the Slack-Jawed Yokel to Uter the Germanic exchange student. 
Dysfunctional, yes, but a community nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're inviting yourself into someone's home when you do a TV  
show,'' Groening says. ``For all of 'The Simpsons' darker strains 
of satire, ultimately it's a celebration of America and the 
American family in its exuberance and absurdity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not a bad gig for the kid who wanted to stay in the sandbox and  
make up stories. And now ``Futurama'': Groening's trip to tomorrow, 
pushing his mind toward fresh frontiers where the next-door 
neighbors may have two heads and six stomachs, but are just trying 
to put worms on the table and save enough to send the larvae off to 
college. 
</P>
<P>
	And in Matt Groening's world, where people reach for happiness  
but usually latch onto something a bit less, what more can anyone 
really ask?

<HEADLINE> Gov't Details Kid's Online Privacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is laying plans for enforcing a  
new law that bans companies from collecting personal information 
from children on the Internet without a parent's permission. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission's proposed rules, announced  
Tuesday, would require operators of commercial Web sites to make 
``reasonable efforts'' in most cases to obtain consent from parents 
before asking children under 13 for their names, addresses, 
telephone numbers or other identifying details. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules also would prohibit a company from enticing children  
with online games or prizes into disclosing ``more personal 
information than is reasonably necessary.'' They will be adopted 
after a 45-day public comment period and will take effect next 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	But the agency didn't suggest in its rules how companies should  
contact parents for permission -- such as by e-mail or fax -- saying 
only that it ``must be reasonably calculated, in light of available 
technology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky said the agency sought to give  
control to parents over information about their kids, while also 
offering flexibility to different businesses on the Internet and to 
new technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``The FTC, quite properly, left that open,'' said Ronald  
Plesser, an attorney who worked with the Direct Marketing 
Association and other groups. ``I think there will be a range of 
mechanisms. The beauty of technology is that today's problem is 
maybe an easy solution tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problems facing regulators involve the faceless nature of  
the Internet, where children often know more about the technology 
than their parents and can easily impersonate an adult with a few 
mouse clicks. 
</P>
<P>
	The government wants to protect children's privacy, but not  
through regulations so onerous they might discourage children from 
using the Internet or hinder the extraordinary potential for 
electronic commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	``Parental consent is the key provision,'' said Katharina Kopp,  
a policy expert at the Washington-based Center for Media Education, 
which lobbied for the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, 
passed by Congress last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without that, the whole legislation is really quite  
meaningless,'' Kopp said. ``We want the FTC to implement effective 
rules that don't create huge loopholes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The law doesn't require companies to obtain a parent's  
permission to collect a child's e-mail address to send him 
information on a one-time basis, such as a digital coupon for a 
video game. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the proposed rules don't suggest ways companies might  
contact parents, the FTC said separately in a news release that 
possibilities include use of a credit card by a parent, a toll-free 
telephone number, a form signed by a parent or e-mail with new 
digital signature technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``They seemed to anticipate this was going to be a hot potato,''  
said Jason Catlett of Junkbusters Corp., a New Jersey-based privacy 
group. ``Rather than put up something that would be shot down from 
all sides, they'll let the commentators fight it out and take what 
they see as a satisfactory compromise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rules also require companies to give parents the choice of  
whether to disclose information about their children to other 
businesses, and to review whatever details were collected from 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	The privacy law was prompted by an FTC study last year of 1,400  
Web sites, including one where children were asked to give their 
names, addresses, e-mail addresses and ages and say whether they 
ever received gifts of stocks, cash, savings bonds or certificates 
of deposit. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Vice President Al Gore hastily stripped from  
his Web site questions asking children for their names, e-mail 
addresses and zip codes after The Associated Press raised questions 
about them. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign officials maintained the questions would not have  
violated the new privacy law, which isn't yet in effect and covers 
only commercial Web sites, but they decided to remove them anyway.

<HEADLINE> Italy, Germany Telecom Deal OK'd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Telecom Italia SpA on Wednesday formally accepted  
a proposal to merge with Deutsche Telekom AG, agreeing to what 
could be the biggest corporate merger in history. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, which would create the world's second-largest  
telecommunications company, came after Telecom Italia's board of 
directors received assurances from the German government that it 
would not interfere with the new firm's business operations. 
</P>
<P>
	A Telecom Italia official, speaking from Rome on condition of  
anonymity, confirmed that the company's board met today and 
approved a linkup of the two former state-run monopolies. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom's board had agreed in principle to the merger on  
Tuesday, but was awaiting clarification on how the German 
government would reduce its controlling interest in what would be 
Europe's biggest telecommunications concern. 
</P>
<P>
	Details of the deal, such as the respective shares Deutsche  
Telekom and Telecom Italia would have in the merged company, were 
not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom officials in Bonn did not immediately respond  
to phone calls seeking comment on Telecom Italia's approval of the 
merger agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's Finance Ministry, the majority shareholder in Deutsche  
Telekom, had advised the Italian Treasury earlier today that it 
would refrain from dominating the activities and corporate 
structure of the merged business. 
</P>
<P>
	``The (German) government's philosophy is not to interfere with  
management decisions'' of privatized companies, ministry spokesman 
Torsten Albig told reporters in Bonn. ``We believe this creates a 
basis for further negotiations between the two companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The assurance was aimed at easing Italian concerns that the  
merger would amount to a takeover by the German government of 
Italy's flagship telephone company. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia, which has been negotiating with Deutsche Telekom  
to thwart a hostile takeover bid from smaller Italian rival 
Olivetti SpA, did not disclose any financial details of the deal it 
favored. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Telecom Italia official, who spoke by telephone from  
Rome on condition of anonymity, said the board decided Tuesday that 
the German government can keep its 72 percent stake in Deutsche 
Telekom, but would need to limit its voting rights after the 
merger. 
</P>
<P>
	With combined revenues of about $63 billion, a merged company  
would ranks as the second largest telecommunications firm in the 
world after Japan's NTT, which posted sales last year of $69 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	A merged company could also have a market value of nearly $200  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, Deutsche Telekom has a market capitalization of about  
$117 billion while Telecom Italia is worth about $77 billion. A 
merger of the two could exceed the value of the pending deal 
between Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp., which was worth about $85 
billion based on the Exxon's recent stock price. 
</P>
<P>
	By linking up, the two former state-run monopolies would create  
a telecommunications behemoth that would dwarf its competitors in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	However, several major issues still must be resolved. The  
biggest hurdle appears to be agreement on how the two partners will 
share ownership of the combined company. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, the German government's 72 percent stake is scheduled  
to fall to 66 percent once the German company issues more stock in 
midsummer. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia stipulated that the merger agreement would have  
to be ``substantially a merger of equals,'' and it did not specify 
what weight each company would have in a new holding company to be 
set up to combine the two firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts have speculated that Deutsche Telekom would account for  
between 56 percent and 60 percent of the holding company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian government owns just 3.4 percent of Telecom Italia,  
but its so-called golden share gives it veto power over major 
decisions like mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	One way of closing the ownership gap would be for the German  
government to reduce its voting rights, the Telecom Italia official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	That would enable the German government to avoid a quick sale of  
a sizeable percentage of its shares. The government is prohibited, 
in any case, from selling the bulk of its stake -- 48 percent of 
Deutsche Telekom shares -- before the end of the year.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists may have found another reason to  
lose weight: A study suggests obese women are six times more likely 
than thin women to have a silent inflammation inside their arteries 
that increases the risk of heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
	If the findings are verified, they would suggest scientists  
should study whether the aspirin some heart patients already take 
might also help overweight people reduce their risk of heart 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists recently discovered that otherwise seemingly healthy  
people may have a low-grade inflammation inside their arteries that 
can lurk for years and significantly increase the risk of a heart 
attack or stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	No one knows what causes this subtle inflammation. One theory is  
bacteria, and indeed, some research suggests that antibiotics may 
help fight heart disease. On the other hand, doctors already 
frequently prescribe aspirin to certain people at high risk of 
heart attack because it thins the blood -- and aspirin also 
decreases inflammation. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was not known whether being overweight -- already a big  
risk for heart disease because of high cholesterol and other 
problems -- played any role in inflammation. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday, Dutch scientist Marjolein Visser unveiled research  
suggesting it might. 
</P>
<P>
	Visser knew that fat cells themselves can produce a substance  
called interleukin-6 that causes inflammation when it seeps into 
the bloodstream. So she used a U.S. database of 16,000 Americans to 
study the question. 
</P>
<P>
	The only way to measure this ``micro-inflammation'' is using a  
blood test that detects C-reactive protein, or CRP. CRP levels 
skyrocket when people are sick, with colds, inflammatory diseases 
like rheumatoid arthritis, even heart disease. But lower levels, 
between 0.2 milligrams and 1 mg per deciliter of blood, are the 
ones that signal the simmering inflammation that has scientists 
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	Visser discovered that obese women are six times more likely to  
have this low-grade inflammation than normal-weight people. 
</P>
<P>
	Obese men were twice as likely to have it, a gender difference  
Visser couldn't explain, except to say that women in the study were 
much more overweight than men studied. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were surprised'' the risk was so high, Visser said Tuesday,  
before presenting her findings at a biology meeting here. If 
verified, ``it could have quite an impact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Visser, a weight specialist at Amsterdam's Vrije University,  
statistically controlled for other diseases that might have caused 
the study participants' CRP levels to rise. 
</P>
<P>
	She found equal risk when examining only healthy people under  
age 40. Even ``at a young age, when you're obese there's this 
inflammation, and we know it's bad for you,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study isn't proof that obesity inflames arteries, cautioned  
Dr. Richard J. Havlik of the National Institute on Aging, which 
funded the research. But the federal agency is intrigued enough 
that it is funding more research into the link -- and probing 
whether obesity-caused inflammation might have ramifications for 
other diseases, too. 
</P>
<P>
	First, Visser is preparing to see whether losing weight causes  
CRP levels to drop immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Her findings, however, raise the question of whether aspirin or  
any of the dozens of other anti-inflammatory drugs, like ibuprofen, 
could help obese people ward off heart disease, and she cautions 
that nobody has tested that yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best thing to do if you're obese is lose weight instead of  
hitting the aspirin bottle,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Tribes Seek Tougher Grave Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thousands of Indian remains and sacred  
artifacts haven't been returned to tribes because of delays by 
museums and loopholes in a federal grave-protection law, a Senate 
committee was told Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 14,000 human remains out of 200,000 identified nationally  
have been returned to tribes under the 1990 law, the committee 
said, and many of the remains that haven't been returned can't be 
identified by tribe. 
</P>
<P>
	But tribal leaders told the Senate Indian Affairs Committee the  
Native American Grave Protection and Repatriation Act is too 
narrowly written, and the National Park Service has too little 
money and staff to enforce it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not rest until we have brought each of our relatives  
home and buried them,'' said Tex Hall, chairman of North Dakota's 
Three Affiliated Tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	The law covered remains and artifacts held by federal agencies  
and federally funded institutions or excavated from federal land. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall worries that the law won't protect remains or artifacts at  
hundreds of sites where his tribal ancestors lived along the 
Missouri River in South Dakota. The sites are on land the federal 
government is turning over to South Dakota's state government under 
a law enacted last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In another case, a Maryland college sold at auction a  
hair-fringed buckskin shirt that purportedly belonged to the Sioux 
leader Crazy Horse. Washington College of Chestertown, Md., claimed 
it wasn't covered by the law. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer representing Crazy Horse's descendants told the  
committee the college sold the shirt without responding to his 
requests to determine whether it was authentic or if it was 
protected by the law. The auction house did not identify the buyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The shirt for all intents and purposes is gone, and we don't  
know where,'' said attorney Robert Gough, a member of South 
Dakota's Rosebud Sioux Tribe. 
</P>
<P>
	The descendants filed a federal lawsuit against the college  
earlier this month and also have asked the National Park Service to 
penalize the private school. 
</P>
<P>
	College officials issued a statement Tuesday that maintained  
they ``acted in full compliance'' with the law and are cooperating 
with federal officials investigating Gough's allegations. The shirt 
was cleared for auction by the U.S. attorney's office in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for organizations of museums and archaeologists told  
the committee the law is working as intended, but they agreed with 
the tribal leaders that it should be broadened beyond federal 
lands. 
</P>
<P>
	``Repatriations of human remains and cultural items, from both  
museum collections and new excavations, occur regularly,'' said 
Keith Kintigh, president of the Society for American Archaeology. 
``Most of these repatriations result from mutual agreements between 
tribes and museums and agencies.''

<HEADLINE> NATO Jets Hit Belgrade Buildings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- With NATO missiles striking Belgrade  
by night and day, the first batch of Apache attack helicopters 
touched down in Albania on Wednesday in a move toward an expanded 
military campaign against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Very strong detonations'' early Thursday rattled the area near  
the Batajnica military airfield just north of Belgrade, where dense 
smoke could be seen rising, according to the state news agency 
Tanjug. The private Beta news agency said about 20 missiles hit the 
airfield and that a ``pillar of flame'' could be seen. 
</P>
<P>
	Other strong explosions hit the Yugoslav capital hours later.  
And Serb media reported NATO jets also attacked the central Serb 
town of Valjevo, hitting a factory and damaging nearby civilian 
homes. There was no report of casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrival of the long-awaited U.S. anti-tank helicopters  
represents a significant boost in NATO's capability to destroy 
tanks and troops of Yugoslav forces blamed for atrocities against 
Kosovo Albanian civilians. It wasn't known when the helicopters 
would go into action. 
</P>
<P>
	In Brussels, NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said the alliance,  
bolstered by extra aircraft, is hitting double the number of 
targets it struck during the first two weeks of the campaign, now 
entering its fifth week. 
</P>
<P>
	Early Wednesday, NATO missiles slammed into a high-rise building  
which includes offices of President Slobodan Milosevic's ruling 
Socialist Party and eight broadcast stations, one of them owned by 
Milosevic's daughter. A senior Yugoslav official called the strikes 
part of a ``genocidal flying circus'' perpetrated by NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours later, NATO launched a daytime strike in the capital area,  
severely damaging a railway bridge over the Sava River a few miles 
west of Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanjug also said the missiles hit a compound near the Kosovo  
town of Djakovica containing Serb refugees from fighting this 
decade in Bosnia and Croatia, killing at least 10 people and 
injuring 16. There was no way to independently verify the report. 
</P>
<P>
	The strikes near Belgrade and the arrival of the Apache  
helicopters signaled NATO's resolve to escalate the conflict until 
Milosevic accepts a Western-dictated peace plan for Kosovo, a 
province of Yugoslavia's republic Serbia with an overwhelmingly 
Albanian population. 
</P>
<P>
	Apaches are among the most lethal tank-killers in the NATO  
arsenal, each armed with 16 Hellfire missiles, 70 mm rockets and a 
30 mm cannon that fires 625 rounds per minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Their use in combat would also mark the U.S. Army's entry into a  
conflict which has been waged by the Air Force and Navy. NATO says 
the Apaches could be sent into Kosovo by next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's of course risk to us,'' Army Capt. Mark Arden of  
Washington, D.C., said in the Albanian capital, Tirana. ``But the 
risks to the Serbs, I would say, are great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Apaches are expected to be used initially against Serb  
targets in southwestern Kosovo. Ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for 
an independent Kosovo have regrouped there after Serbs drove them 
from many of their traditional strongholds. 
</P>
<P>
	International monitors said 18 rebels were wounded and two  
killed in a second straight day of heavy fighting Wednesday in 
southwestern Kosovo near the Albanian border. 
</P>
<P>
	As the air campaign escalated, alliance spokesmen said NATO  
blasted more than 20 targets early Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the bridge outside Belgrade, two others over the  
commercially important Danube River also were wrecked around Novi 
Sad, Serbia's second-largest city. NATO says it is targeting the 
bridges to prevent the army from resupplying its forces in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav officials expressed outrage at the pre-dawn strike on  
the 23-story Socialist Party building in Belgrade, calling it a 
purely civilian target. 
</P>
<P>
	``This genocidal, flying circus of the NATO alliance has caused  
huge destruction,'' said Goran Matic, a federal government 
minister. ``But citizens of Yugoslavia will not give in -- NATO can 
destroy many more buildings and bridges, claim more human lives, 
but it cannot take away our freedom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	British Defense Secretary George Robertson said: ``We are now  
striking at the very heart of his (Milosevic's) bloodstained 
regime, and we'll do so again and again and again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's Shea said that ``any aspect of the power structure is  
considered as a legitimate target by NATO.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If I can take the image of the human body,'' he said, ``we  
will go for the brain as much as we will go for the fingertips.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 14-month Kosovo conflict has killed thousands of people and  
driven more than 600,000 ethnic Albanians from their homes. Just 
over a million people remain in Kosovo, and an estimated 850,000 
are internally displaced, according to Shea.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Promises Military Funerals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Any qualified veteran can be buried with  
military honors -- a flag ceremony and the playing of ``Taps'' -- 
under a Pentagon plan to address complaints that the military 
sometimes did not accommodate funeral requests. 
</P>
<P>
	The guarantee, which must be approved by Congress, would apply  
to veterans who served with honor, said Gail McGinn, deputy 
assistant secretary of defense for personnel support. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon plans a toll-free number for funeral directors to  
make arrangements for a military honor detail, and a World Wide Web 
site with details, McGinn said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that is going to drive up the demand'' for services  
to 45 percent of eligible families from 9 percent, she said at a 
Pentagon briefing on the new policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Sending the minimum detail of two military personnel to that  
many funerals would cost an estimated $75 million next year and 
$207 million by 2005, a Pentagon report issued Wednesday said. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, the individual services handled funeral requests ad  
hoc -- sending representatives when they could but also turning down 
about a quarter of the 37,000 annual valid requests for funeral 
honors, McGinn said. 
</P>
<P>
	The main problem in meeting the existing demand is that deaths  
of veterans have increased while the size of the military has 
decreased, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Deaths of veterans are projected to increase from 537,000 in  
1997 to 620,000 by 2008, as the vast ranks of World War II era 
veterans die, the Pentagon estimates. Active-duty forces are 35 
percent smaller than in 1989, and the reserves are 25 percent 
smaller. 
</P>
<P>
	There are approximately 26 million military veterans in the  
United States, 16 million of whom served during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Active-duty and reserve forces will continue to divide funeral  
duties, but the new policy gives reservists additional points 
toward their retirements for participating in the services. 
</P>
<P>
	If approved by Congress, the new policy would take effect Jan.  
1, 2000.

<HEADLINE> Colorado Teams Postpone Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Colorado Avalanche and the San Jose Sharks  
today postponed their first-round NHL playoff series after a deadly 
shooting at a suburban high school. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams were scheduled to open the Stanley Cup playoffs  
tonight and Thursday at McNichols Arena, but Game 1 will be played 
Saturday in San Jose. Other details about the schedule were not 
immediately announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado Rockies also called off a game for the second  
straight day because of the killings at Columbine High School in 
Littleton. 
</P>
<P>
	Rockies officials said today the team's players and coaches will  
wear a Columbine High School patch on their right sleeves for the 
rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are deeply saddened by the events in Littleton yesterday  
and now is not the time to play baseball,'' Colorado Rockies vice 
chairman Charlie Monfort said. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the second consecutive postponement in the three-game  
series between the Rockies and Montreal. The teams will play two 
split doubleheaders when the Expos return in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Both split doubleheaders will be played in what had been a  
three-games series Aug. 13-15, but the exact date of either was not 
set. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies open a four-game series in San Francisco on  
Thursday. Montreal has a day off Thursday and worked out at Coors 
Field today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't have played,'' Expos third baseman Shane Andrews  
said Tuesday. ``I had a hard time just being on the field. Thinking 
about it makes me sick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 15 people were killed at the suburban high school,  
and on Tuesday night the Denver Nuggets postponed their NBA game 
with Portland at McNichols Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where can your kids be safe? On the streets?'' Nuggets forward  
Eric Williams said. ``I feel for those families. You send your kids 
away to school this morning on a peaceful note and come home to 
something tragic like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Nuggets general manager Dan Issel: ``I guess the scary  
thing is it could happen anywhere, it could happen anywhere at any 
time. We don't know how our world got to this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Issel promised that the Nuggets and Avalanche Community Fund  
``will do something financially for those victims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1997, 12 students have been killed in shootings at schools  
in Mississippi, Kentucky, Arkansas and Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can happen to anyone,'' said Colorado pitcher Brian  
Bohanon, who has five children. ``The way things are going 
nowadays, it's popping up all over the country. It's a tragedy. 
They're just kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You start thinking about life,'' Rockies first baseman Todd  
Helton said. ``Players in here are sort of in our own little world, 
and this sort of opens your eyes a little bit to how important life 
is and how important kids are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montreal manager Felipe Alou, who managed the Triple-A Denver  
Bears in 1981, has had sobering reminders. He was with the Expos 
when umpire John McSherry collapsed and died of a heart attack in 
the first inning of Montreal's 1996 season opener in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how many people care if we are playing,'' Alou  
said Tuesday. ``I remember that day in Cincinnati. The whole team 
died with one man dying. ... We can't play. We can't even play 
cards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In April 1992, the Expos were told to wait in San Diego because  
of rioting in Los Angeles. Their three-game series with the Dodgers 
was postponed because Los Angeles was considered too dangerous.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T May Take Stake in Japan Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Telecommunications giants AT&AMP;T Corp. and British  
Telecommunications PLC have agreed to take a combined 30 percent 
stake in Japan Telecom Co., a report said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, AT&AMP;T and BT will each hold a 15 percent stake in  
Japan Telecom, Japan's third-largest long-distance telephone 
carrier, and gain a seat on the company's board of directors, the 
Nihon Keizai financial daily said. 
</P>
<P>
	The total size of their combined investment could be as much as  
$1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan Telecom spokesman Mitsuhiro Kurano said Thursday that the  
company has not yet decided to form a tie-up with AT&AMP;T and BT. He 
declined to comment on the details of the newspaper report. 
</P>
<P>
	The three firms are reportedly planning a broad alliance in  
which AT&AMP;T and BT will integrate most of their Japanese operations 
with Japan Telecom's units. 
</P>
<P>
	The three companies will offer Internet and other data  
communication services to multinational corporations and will also 
cooperate in neighboring Asian telecommunications markets, the 
Nihon Keizai said. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T is the largest long distance and international carrier in  
the United States, while BT is Britain's biggest telecommunications 
company. Japan Telecom is an affiliate of East Japan Railway Co.

<HEADLINE> Dow Jones Launches Web Portal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones &AMP; Co.,  
seeking to further capitalize on its strong brand name, plans to 
launch a new business news site on the Internet and sell full pages 
stories on careers and personal finance for newspapers to use on 
Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcements, made at the company's annual shareholders'  
meeting in New York Wednesday, mark Dow Jones' latest foray into 
the online world. It already runs a successful interactive version 
of The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Interactive, both of which 
would be unaffected by the launch of the new site, dowjones.com, 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Dowjones.com will draw news and information from The Wall Street  
Journal and Dow Jones Newswires, in addition to offering Web search 
features, stock quotes and other information. The company is hoping 
that business users will mark the site as a main ``portal'' for 
exploring other parts of the Internet, much as giants like Yahoo! 
do for general users. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow Jones also plans to produce complete news pages formatted in  
the pattern of The Wall Street Journal for use in Sunday editions 
of newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	The pages would contain original stories on personal finance and  
careers produced by a team of reporters at The Wall Street Journal. 
Participating newspapers would pay a fee for the service, which is 
expected to be launched in the fall, and share advertising revenues 
with Dow Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	During the meeting, Dow Jones chairman and chief executive  
officer Peter Kann also heard protests from reporters angry at a 
company proposal to slash its contributions to a popular pension 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Davis of the Journal's Washington's bureau warned Kann of  
the ``anger and unhappiness in the newsroom'' over the company's 
proposal to slash its contribution of 15 percent of an employee's 
salary to 5 percent, with up to an additional 3 percent in matching 
funds if employees contribute. 
</P>
<P>
	Another reporter, Steve Liesman, also protested the proposal.  
Both Davis and Leisman were on a team of Journal reporters that won 
a Pulitzer Prize last week for reporting on the Russian financial 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The pension plan is a major issue in discussions between the  
company and its main union, the Independent Association of 
Publishers' Employees. The two sides are currently negotiating a 
new contract to replace the current one, which expires next week 
but can be extended by either side through the end of June.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Rise; Dow Gains 132.87 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices rose sharply Wednesday, lifting the  
Dow Jones industrial average to a new closing high, as strong 
earnings reports sent investors back in search of Internet and 
pharmaceutical issues. 
</P>

	The Dow, which rallied strongly in the final 20 minutes of  
trading, rose 132.87 to 10,581.42. The blue chips achieved their 
first close above 10,500, having surpassed the previous high of 
10,493.89 set last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 29.95 to 1,336.12, and the Nasdaq  
composite index, with its high representation of technology issues, 
rose 79.44 to 2,489.08. 
</P>
<P>
	Even small-company stocks, which have not participated in the  
market's advances for some time, were higher, pushing the Russell 
2000 index up 11.23, or 2.7 percent, to 426.57. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're seeing a degree of strength today in many of the areas  
that were hit hard for the past week or more, and that strength is 
triggered by strength in earnings,'' said A. Marshall Acuff, market 
strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. 
</P>
<P>
	During last week's trading and on Monday, investors had dumped  
technology and drug stocks for the shares of companies whose 
fortunes move up and down with the economy. They did so on the 
promise that the so-called deep cyclicals, big manufacturing 
companies like Caterpillar and Deere, would benefit from an 
impending recovery in the world economy. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tuesday and Wednesday, the suddenly out-of-favor technology  
and drug companies came out with strong first-quarter earnings, 
Acuff said, supporting with real numbers the stunning advances in 
their stock prices since October. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market has shifted gears and decided to go with the  
earnings reports,'' Acuff said. 
</P>
<P>
	The shift back into technology was helped by Qualcomm, whose  
shares soared 54 7/16 to 195 1/16 after the San Diego-based maker 
of digital-wireless technology company reported operating income of 
82 cents a share, well above analysts' expected 59 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks bounced back, with America Online gaining 14  
1/16 to 142 3/4 on the Big Board and Amazon.com up 7 1/4 to 179 1/4 in 
Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug stocks were boosted by Bristol-Myers Squibb, whose shares  
rose 5 to 64 1/4 on a strong earnings report Wednesday. The 
pharmaceutical stocks were also helped by Johnson &AMP; Johnson and 
SmithKline Beecham, which beat Wall Street forecasts in earnings 
released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some high-profile computer stocks, however, struggled through  
the session. Microsoft shed 1 1/8 to 82 after the software maker 
reported first-quarter earnings late Tuesday of 35 cents a share, 
beating analysts' expected 32 cents. But Microsoft warned that Year 
2000 computer bug concerns could slow growth later in the year, and 
Prudential Securities downgraded the stock's rating to ``hold'' 
from ``accumulate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investors got confirmation of strong computer-company earnings  
after the close of trading, when IBM said its first-quarter results 
were $1.55 a share, solidly beating analysts' expected $1.41. IBM, 
a Dow component, closed up 2 1/8 at 171 7/8 and soared as high as 188 in 
after-hours trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq Computer shares closed up 1/4 at 24 1/4, recovering from an  
earlier decline. The company beat analysts' diminished earnings 
expectations by a penny a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer stocks rose after Coca-Cola beat expectations as well,  
boosting its stock 2 5/16 to 67 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Freedman, chief investment officer for the John Hancock  
Funds in Boston, said he thought the market could continue to rise 
as first-quarter earnings reports come out. Based on reports so far 
this week, he said, ``it looks like a very good first quarter 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advancers led decliners by 6 to 5 on the New York Stock  
Exchange. Consolidated volume was heavy at 1.09 billion shares but 
below Tuesday's pace of 1.16 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index reached a new closing high, rising  
12.87 to 633.71. The American Stock Exchange composite index also 
had a record high close, gaining 13.61 to 750.59. 
</P>
<P>
	In overseas trading, the Nikkei index in Tokyo fell 1.21 percent  
as investors were spooked by a pessimistic forecast by the 
International Monetary Fund about Japanese economic growth. In 
Europe, Germany's DAX index was up 1.24 percent. Britain's FT-SE 
100 was down .71 percent, and France's CAC-40 average was up 0.90 
percent.

<HEADLINE> NATO Jets Hit Belgrade Buildings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO missiles slammed into a  
Belgrade high-rise today that Western officials termed a ``nerve 
center'' of Slobodan Milosevic's ruling machine, setting floors 
ablaze in a bold attack on the offices of Yugoslavia's hard-line 
governing party. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, meanwhile, rushed more troops and equipment  
into Albania as border clashes raised fears of an expanding Balkan 
war. 
</P>
<P>
	About 24 Apache anti-tank helicopters intended to improve NATO's  
ability to strike Yugoslav ground forces in Kosovo left Italy today 
for Albania. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid concerns the conflict may spread, the president of  
Montenegro, Yugoslavia's smaller pro-Western republic, was reported 
today to have rejected demands by the Yugoslav army that he put his 
republic's police force under Belgrade control. 
</P>
<P>
	Along other tense borders, Croatia charged that Yugoslavia had  
moved up to 300 troops into a U.N.-controlled demilitarized zone 
between Croatia and Montenegro, and Yugoslav forces wounded an 
Albanian soldier in a firefight along that southern border. 
</P>
<P>
	In nearby Macedonia, President Kiro Gligorov warned that the  
influx of 130,000 Kosovo Albanian refugees and the presence of 
thousands of NATO troops was destabilizing his country, like 
Croatia a former Yugoslav republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Aid officials scrambled today to care for thousands of newly  
arrived refugees from Kosovo crammed into a remote village inside 
the Macedonian border. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO said its airpower blasted some 30 targets as its campaign  
entered its fifth week. Air raid sirens sounded this afternoon in 
Belgrade and the Montenegrin capital Podgorica, signaling renewed 
NATO air activity. 
</P>
<P>
	In Novi Sad, Yugoslavia's second-largest city, NATO struck an  
oil refinery and left the city's last remaining bridge over the 
Danube River impassable except for pedestrians. The strike 
effectively cut Belgrade's rail connection with Budapest and the 
rest of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO says it is targeting the bridges to prevent the army  
resupplying its forces in Kosovo from northern Vojvodina province. 
</P>
<P>
	At least three missiles struck a 23-story office building in New  
Belgrade, across the Sava River from the heart of the Yugoslav 
capital. The building housed offices of Milosevic's Socialist 
party, as well as three local television and radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
	The pre-dawn strike left a gaping hole on the first floor and  
plunged the upper floors into flames that firefighters were 
battling hours later. Belgrade Deputy Mayor Spasoje Krunic said 
there apparently were no casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are now striking at the very heart of his (Milosevic's)  
blood-stained regime, and we'll do so again and again and again,'' 
British Defense Secretary George Robertson declared. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling the action the work of ``criminals,'' Serbian Prime  
Minister Mirko Marjanovic declared, ``They cannot bend us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic's daughter Marija visited the site this morning. She  
owns Kosava radio and TV, and others who are close to authorities 
control privately owned radio and TV Pink and BK -- all knocked off 
the air. 
</P>
<P>
	The state news agency Tanjug said NATO struck a compound near  
the Kosovo town of Djakovica containing Serb refugees from the 
Bosnian and Croatian wars, killing at least 10 people and injuring 
16. There was no way to independently verify the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav media also reported pre-dawn attacks today in northern  
and central Serbia, including the town of Valjevo, where six 
missiles struck a factory, triggering a huge fire. One person was 
reported injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbian media reported attacks today near the central town of  
Kraljevo, on Novi Slankamen near Novi Sad, on Uzice in western 
Serbia and near Cacak in southwestern Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied missiles hit a radio and TV transmission tower on Mount  
Fruska Gora outside Novi Sad. 
</P>
<P>
	The NATO airstrikes, which began March 24, aim to halt  
Milosevic's campaign to drive ethnic Albanians from Kosovo, a 
province of Yugoslavia's main republic, Serbia, and have him sign 
off on a peace deal agreed to in February by ethnic Albanian 
negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
	Many in Kosovo, where 90 percent of the 2 million prewar  
population was ethnic Albanian, favor independence from Serbia, an 
option Milosevic has rejected. The 14-month conflict has killed at 
least 2,000 people and driven more than 600,000 ethnic Albanians 
from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports emerged Tuesday of increased fighting in southwestern  
Kosovo between Serb-led Yugoslav forces and the separatist Kosovo 
Liberation Army. Fifteen wounded KLA fighters were brought to a 
hospital in the Albanian border town of Bajram Curri, along with 
the bodies of two rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	In Montenegro, where Western officials have warned that  
Milosevic is plotting a military takeover, President Milo 
Djukanovic was quoted today as saying the Yugoslav army ordered his 
government Monday night to let it take control of the republic's 
police force. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is out of the question that the ministry of the interior  
could be subordinated to the Yugoslav army,'' Djukanovic said, 
according to the British newspaper the Financial Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic has already replaced the entire army command in  
Montenegro. Tension increased this week with reports that Yugoslav 
forces were occupying northern villages in Montenegro. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Croatian ambassador to the United Nations  
complained to the Security Council that up to 300 Yugoslav soldiers 
had moved Tuesday into the demilitarized zone between Croatia and 
Montenegro. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Croatia and Yugoslavia claim the zone, and the two fought a  
bitter war in 1991 as Croatia broke free of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Macedonia's president asked his nation's supreme  
defense council Tuesday to declare a state of emergency, saying the 
flood of Kosovo Albanians threatens to upset his nation's fragile 
ethnic balance. Roughly one-third of Macedonia's 2 million people 
are ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Two NATO soldiers were slightly injured in Macedonia on Tuesday  
when angry Serbs hurled stones at French vehicles in the village of 
Kuceviste, just west of the capital Skopje. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen said the United States planned  
to use the three-day NATO summit in Washington starting Friday to 
press allies for an oil embargo and other economic sanctions 
against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia said today it will boycott NATO's 50th anniversary summit  
to protest the alliance's airstrikes against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	But on the diplomatic front, Russia's envoy on the Kosovo crisis  
was expected to visit Belgrade on Thursday for talks. Former 
Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin hopes his old ties with Milosevic will 
help produce a solution to the conflict.

<HEADLINE> Cook Guilty of Killing Waitress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A short-order cook who killed a waitress  
after an argument over poached eggs has been convicted of 
first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Hashem Zayed faces 25 years to life in prison for shooting to  
death Helen Menicou, a woman he worked with at the Pinecrest 
Restaurant for close to 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The two had a stormy relationship that reached a head in July  
1997 when Zayed made a customer poached eggs, even though they were 
not on the menu. Menicou berated him in front of customers and 
employees, ordering him not to prepare the dish. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day Zayed shot the 47-year-old Menicou during  
breakfast-time at the diner when she mentioned the incident again. 
She ran behind the counter, but he followed her and shot her four 
more times. 
</P>
<P>
	His defense attorney said at trial that Zayed is a dimwitted man  
whose pride was crushed when he was ridiculed in front of regular 
customers.

<HEADLINE>  `Trenchcoat Mafia' Were Outcasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- They called themselves the ``Trenchcoat  
Mafia,'' a dozen outcast students who hated blacks, Hispanics, Jews 
and athletes, and dressed up in long black dusters, like villains 
of the Old West. 
</P>
<P>
	They played World War II games, bragged about their guns, and  
razzed fellow students about kowtowing to the elite students at 
Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	But few students took them seriously until Tuesday, when police  
said two members of the rebellious group took out guns and started 
firing. 
</P>
<P>
	Classmates and Denver media identified the dead gunmen as Eric  
Harris and Dylan Klebold, both juniors at the school. Police 
refused to confirm the identities, but were seen at Harris' home, 
carrying out items including a computer. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``trenchcoats'' were seen as smart and computer-savvy,  
fellow students said. Harris lived in a tidy, two-story home on a 
quiet suburban cul-de-sac -- deserted today except for a steady 
stream of reporters driving through the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Sean Kelly, a 16-year-old junior, shared a computer lab with  
Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	``They just didn't seem to be all there. They liked things like  
Soldier of Fortune magazine,'' Kelly said. Harris made his own 
video production at school in which he bragged about some of his 
new guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said the two boys killed themselves following a  
``suicide mission'' in which they marched through the school, 
hurling pipe bombs and firing shotguns, leaving a trail of bodies. 
They said they learned of the group only after Tuesday's shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``School officials said they had no problems with the two  
suspects, there were no discipline problems,'' Jefferson County 
sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson County District Attorney Dave Thomas said today both  
shooters had a juvenile record, but nothing violent. ``They were 
involved in the same incident, which was theft and trespass to a 
car,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Trenchcoat Mafia members were questioned by police,  
including one who was led away in handcuffs Tuesday. But no arrests 
were made, Davis said, and there was no indication that any of the 
others took part in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly said members of the group made a number of ``generally  
derogatory remarks'' about Hispanics and blacks, and were 
considered outcasts by other students at the school. But officials 
said today that only one of the victims was black. 
</P>
<P>
	They had a long-running feud with some of the school's athletes,  
who enjoyed the popularity the Trenchcoats lacked. 
</P>
<P>
	``A couple of months ago, the jocks were supposed to fight  
them,'' said Matt Good, 16, a football player. But the Trenchcoats 
showed up two hours late, at the wrong spot, carrying swords and 
brass knuckles, and the fight was never rescheduled, Good said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1998 yearbook, a photo showed members of the group  
locking arms and smiling, was accompanied by the caption, ``Who 
says we're different? Insanity's healthy. ... Stay alive, stay 
different, stay crazy!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Morris, a leader of the group, is grinning broadly.  
</P>
<P>
	Klebold's sallow-faced picture appears on a separate page, with  
the statement: ``After going through many experiences in their 
lives, oftentimes students have regrets of past actions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Student Andrew Beard said members of the group often came to  
school in steel-toed combat boots, some of them wearing Nazi 
crosses. Tuesday was the anniversary of Adolf Hitler's birthday, 
and student Aaron Cohn said that was a significant day for 
Trenchcoat members, who would make references to 4-20. He said they 
often made anti-Semitic comments. 
</P>
<P>
	Beard said a dozen students joined the group last year, adopting  
the trademark dusters and sometimes wearing red or green berets, 
but the numbers dwindled to a half-dozen this year as the novelty 
wore off. He said he knew of no special significance for the 
dusters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dylan said he hated the jocks, and how they could walk over  
people and thought they were tough,'' Beard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Josh Nielsen, 17, a junior at the school, said he knew members  
of the group as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``They liked playing war games,'' he said. ``That's all they  
could talk about. They played war games and they liked to re-enact 
World War II battles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks Brown, who said he knew both gunmen, said he was walking  
out of school Tuesday morning when Harris warned him to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was walking out for a cigarette and I told him, `Hey, man'  
and he said, `Brooks, I like you. Now, get out of here. Go home.' 
And so I didn't think twice about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown told The Denver Post he and Harris had made up after a  
feud, but the boy was filled with hate. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did it because he hated people,'' Brown said. ``He loved  
the moment. He loved killing people, he liked that idea. He lived 
in that. That's how I knew it would end the way this did -- kill all 
the hostages and then themselves; I couldn't see anything else.''

<HEADLINE> Y2K Expert Worried About Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House on Wednesday expressed its  
most serious concerns to date over anticipated Year 2000 computer 
failures overseas, particularly among Russian-designed nuclear 
plants in nine countries. 
</P>
<P>
	In its latest report on the technology glitch, President  
Clinton's top Y2K expert, John Koskinen, said one of his greatest 
international concerns was ensuring safe operation of 65 such 
nuclear plants, including one in eastern Russia, not far from 
Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	Koskinen, who heads Clinton's Year 2000 Conversion Council, said  
those nuclear plants are in countries ``obviously with major 
economic problems,'' and U.S. experts know few details about how 
the Russian equipment will react to the date rollover. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the extent you don't have information, you get more nervous  
about it,'' Koskinen said Wednesday. ``We are focused on it. It is 
an important problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An expert on those nuclear plants, Richard Wilson of Harvard  
University, said control systems to prevent serious accidents are 
mostly not computerized, although some electronic monitors could be 
affected by the technology glitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly something that we should try to get straight,''  
Wilson said. ``It doesn't cost much to have a half-dozen experts 
looking carefully at the problem. The probability is that they'll 
come up with nothing important, nothing crucial. There's a small 
probability they'll come up with something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just last week, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Bulgak  
announced that the Y2K problem will not threaten his country's 
nuclear missiles or its nuclear power stations. But he also said 
Russia will need Western help to pay for computer repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest report from the White House reflects unprecedented  
pessimism about overseas efforts by the administration, warning 
that failures in some foreign countries are now all but certain in 
electric power, telecommunications and transportation networks. 
</P>
<P>
	It said those problems will affect Americans living abroad and  
also will affect the global economy -- due to international travel 
and trade -- and are sure to be felt in the United States, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any failure anywhere will have a ripple effect on us,''  
Koskinen said. The government will issue specific warnings to 
travelers late this summer or early fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Many computers originally programmed to recognize only the last  
two digits of a year will not work properly beginning Jan. 1, 2000, 
when some machines will assume it is 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Koskinen on Wednesday estimated U.S. companies will spend a  
total of $70 billion to $80 billion to repair their computers but 
cautioned, ``That's just a ballpark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report Wednesday from the administration included generally  
positive news about U.S. efforts in some of the most important 
areas, such as electricity, telephones, banking and transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	It predicted that national failures in those areas are unlikely,  
although it cautioned about ``minor disruptions, which may impact 
consumers minimally'' from oil and natural gas companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``In no place at this juncture do we think you'll be without  
power for a week,'' Koskinen said. ``Outages, if there are any, 
will be in the nature of minutes and hours, not days and weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the report was harshly critical of hospitals and doctors'  
offices for failing to verify that their computer billing systems 
will tolerate the date change, saying small health providers may be 
forced to shut down. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration said it anticipates no widespread or severe  
disruptions in the nation's food supply, in part because large 
grocery chains already carry several weeks' inventory in case of 
delivery problems or bad weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcasters probably won't experience problems, either.  
</P>
<P>
	``The public should continue to have access to television and  
radio broadcast services through the date rollover,'' the report 
said, warning only of ``isolated channel outages and limited 
problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly half the federal agencies failed to meet last month's  
deadline for having their most important computers fixed, although 
the administration said 93 percent of those systems are now ready 
for 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Remembering 16 tiny coffins after a gunman opened  
fire in a Scottish school three years ago, Britain urged the United 
States on Wednesday to respond to its deadliest school massacre by 
putting handguns out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain imposed a near-total ban on handguns after Thomas  
Hamilton used four legally owned guns to kill 16 kindergarten 
children and their teacher before killing himself on March 13, 
1996, in Dunblane. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's school attack by two Littleton, Colo., teen-agers who  
laughed as they shot victims and then killed themselves, stunned 
much of the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that they will look carefully at what this country did  
in banning handguns after the Dunblane massacre, and I hope we 
never have to wake up to this sort of news again from America,'' 
Defense Secretary George Robertson told British Broadcasting Corp. 
radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Many reports from around the world criticized the easy  
availability of guns in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``How sick is the gun society of America?'' mused an article in  
the Yomiuri daily in Japan, where reports focused on how the two 
suspects appeared to target minorities and athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The shooting has brought to light once again the warped  
strains of 'an advanced society,''' said an article in the national 
Asahi newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with Asahi, Mieko Hattori, the mother of a  
16-year-old Japanese exchange student in the United States who was 
fatally shot in 1992 while looking for a Halloween party, said she 
hoped the latest shootings would lead to tighter gun control laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guns are still everywhere. Even a high school student can get  
them,'' she was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Vatican, Pope John Paul II urged Americans to seek ``the  
moral vision and the values which alone can ensure respect for the 
inviolable dignity of human life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some weren't optimistic that this would happen.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is no reason to believe that America will now wake up,  
as President Bill Clinton hopes,'' said the Oslo, Norway, newspaper 
Aftenposten, pointing out that previous school killings had 
prompted little action. 
</P>
<P>
	British gun laws, now among the tightest in the world, allow  
police to seek the full medical history of anyone applying for a 
gun license, including details of any mental health problems. Every 
applicant must provide the names of two people who have known them 
for at least two years and who support their application. 
</P>
<P>
	The few exceptions to the ban include antique weapons, starting  
pistols, and small shot pistols used against rats, mice and other 
pests.

<HEADLINE> Shooting Named After Colo. Flower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Columbine High School, scene of  
Tuesday's deadly school shooting, is named after the resilient 
mountain blossom that is Colorado's state flower. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a perennial that grows about 18 inches high in moist soil,  
and it withstands cold, windy conditions on mountain slopes. Its 
silky, bell-shaped blossoms come in shades of blue, white, yellow 
and pink, making it a popular native plant for alpine gardens. 
</P>
<P>
	The columbine was documented on July 10, 1820, by Edwin James  
prior to climbing Pikes Peak. Colorado students chose it as the 
state's flower in 1891. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1925, state lawmakers voted to protect the columbine. It is  
illegal to pick more than 25 columbine buds in one day, or to 
uproot the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	The state song is ``Where the Columbine Grows.''  
</P>
<P>
	More than 100 businesses, organizations and public buildings use  
the flower in their names.

<HEADLINE> Korean Air to Shuffle Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Under government pressure to improve a  
dismal safety record, the president of Korean Air is stepping aside 
from direct management of the airline, sources said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cho Yang-ho, 50, who has been running the airline as president  
since 1992, will leave that post to become chairman of Korean Air, 
a subsidiary of the Hanjin Group, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	He will succeed his father, Cho Joong-hoon, 79, who will leave  
the airline but is expected to retain the chairmanship of Hanjin, 
South Korea's sixth-largest conglomerate, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	A professional manager within the airline -- most likely one of  
its two vice presidents -- will be promoted to become president with 
day-to-day management control, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decision was reported last night to the government, which  
we believe is satisfied,'' one source said. Korean Air scheduled a 
news conference for Thursday afternoon to announce the changes. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unusual move two days ago, President Kim Dae-jung said a  
recent series of Korean Air accidents reflected badly on the nation 
and demanded changes in the airline's management. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim said the airline had put rapid expansion and profits ahead  
of safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's comments came five days after a Korean Air cargo  
jet crashed shortly after takeoff from Shanghai last week, killing 
its three crewmen and six people on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the latest in a series of accidents that have given  
Korean Air one of the worst safety records in commercial aviation. 
More than 700 people have died in Korean Air accidents in the past 
20 years, including 228 in the 1997 crash of a Boeing 747 on Guam. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Shanghai crash, Delta Air Lines dropped its  
code-sharing flight partnership with Korean Air, saying that it 
would not do business with any carrier it did not believe to be 
safe. Air Canada followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Korean Air, formerly Korean Airlines, was founded 30 years ago  
by the senior Cho with eight planes flying domestic routes. The 
airline has since grown into the world's 13th-largest carrier.

<HEADLINE> Report Probes Notorious B.I.G. Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Police suspect that jailed music producer  
Marion ``Suge'' Knight played a prominent role in the ambush 
slaying of rapper Notorious B.I.G., the Los Angeles Times reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities declined to give details on what evidence they have  
linking Knight to the killing, the newspaper reported, citing 
unidentified police sources. No charges have been filed against 
Knight in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, police confirmed that search warrants were served this  
week but described Knight as only a possible suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was in custody at the time so he didn't pull the trigger,''  
said Lt. Al Michelena of the department's robbery-homicide unit. 
``We are investigating the possibility of him being implicated in 
this. We would certainly consider him a possible suspect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michelena told The Associated Press he would have to remain  
vague. Affidavits filed to obtain the search warrants have been 
sealed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Notorious B.I.G., whose real name was Christopher Wallace, was  
in his GMC Suburban about to leave a party when he was shot several 
times on March 9, 1997. He was pronounced dead at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, detectives served search warrants on four locations  
linked to Knight. Police seized a Chevrolet Impala that matches 
witnesses' description of the car used in the drive-by killing, the 
Times said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police also searched the offices of Death Row Records, the  
company Knight founded and built into one of the hottest rap labels 
in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight is currently serving a nine-year prison term for  
violating probation in connection with a 1992 attack on two 
aspiring rappers in a Hollywood recording studio. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight's lawyer, David Kenner, declined to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	At the time of Wallace's death, rap industry observers had  
acknowledged tensions between Death Row and Wallace's producer, New 
York-based Bad Boys Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace's shooting apparently was payback for previous squabbles  
between the two labels, the Times quoted police sources as saying. 
``This was a professional hit,'' one source told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Six months before Wallace's death, rapper Tupac Shakur and  
Knight were in Las Vegas when someone fired on their car. Shakur, 
one of Knight's most successful artists, later died of his 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Police sources told the Times that Knight believes people at Bad  
Boy may have been behind that attack, though a link has never been 
proved. Shakur's shooting has remained unsolved.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Promises Military Funerals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon said Wednesday it will guarantee  
military funerals to all qualified veterans, and expects that close 
to half those eligible will want the honor. 
</P>
<P>
	The new policy, which must be approved by Congress, would mean a  
flag ceremony and the playing of ``Taps'' at the funeral of any 
veteran who served honorably. The request must come from the 
veteran's family. 
</P>
<P>
	The guarantee follows complaints from families and in Congress  
that the military sometimes did not accommodate valid funeral 
requests. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon plans a toll-free number for funeral directors to  
make arrangements for a military honor detail, and a World Wide Web 
site with details, said Gail McGinn, deputy assistant secretary of 
defense for personnel support. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that is going to drive up the demand,'' for  
services, to 45 percent of eligible families from 9 percent, she 
said at a Pentagon briefing on the new policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Sending the minimum detail of two military personnel to that  
many funerals would cost an estimated $75 million next year, and 
$207 million by 2005, a Pentagon report issued Wednesday said. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to now, the individual services handled funeral requests ad  
hoc -- sending representatives when they could but also turning down 
about a quarter of the 37,000 annual valid requests for funeral 
honors, McGinn said. 
</P>
<P>
	The main problem in complying with the existing flow of requests  
is that veteran deaths have increased while the size of the 
military has decreased, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Deaths of veterans are projected to increase from 537,000 in  
1997 to 620,000 by 2008, as the vast ranks of World War II era 
veterans die off, the Pentagon estimates. Active duty forces are 35 
percent smaller than in 1989, and the reserves are 25 percent 
smaller. 
</P>
<P>
	There are approximately 26 million military veterans in the  
United States, 16 million of whom served during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Active duty and reserve forces will continue to divide funeral  
duties, but the new policy gives reservists additional points 
toward their retirements for participating in the services. 
</P>
<P>
	If approved by Congress, the new policy would take effect Jan.  
1, 2000.

<HEADLINE>  Colo. School Checked for Booby Traps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Working around bodies still lying where  
they fell more than a day earlier, bomb squad officers checked 
lockers and backpacks for booby traps Wednesday as investigators 
tried to piece together one of the deadliest school massacres in 
U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen students and one teacher were killed at Columbine High  
School, most of them in the library. They included the two teen-age 
gunmen who laughed as they opened fire on their schoolmates 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunmen, Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, apparently  
shot themselves in the head. Officials were trying to determine if 
others were involved, and they questioned other members of the 
boys' dark group of outcasts, the ``Trenchcoat Mafia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities on Wednesday removed the bodies of two victims who  
died outside the building. Also, more than 24 hours after the 
attack, parents finally received official word of their children's 
fate. Police hoped to remove the other bodies later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators left the corpses in place overnight so that they  
could check for explosives and record the details of the crime 
scene, which SWAT members described as something from ``Dante's 
Inferno.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many bodies were sprawled on the floor, slumped in desks or  
crouched beneath tables, boxes and cubicles where they apparently 
tried to hide. Police found a handgun under one of the killers, and 
a semiautomatic rifle and two sawed-off shotguns elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a different sort of chaos inside,'' SWAT Sgt. George  
Hinkle said. ``There were fire alarms going off, strobe lights, 
four inches of water in the cafeteria. We had been told there were 
bombs in backpacks and there were backpacks everywhere. It was the 
toughest tactical problem I've ever seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said 30 explosive devices had  
been found at Columbine, in the killers' vehicles and at their 
homes. Late Tuesday, more than 10 hours after the shootings, a time 
bomb blew up, but no one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of these devices are on timing devices, some are  
incendiary devices and some are pipe bombs,'' Sheriff John Stone 
told ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' ``Some are like hand grenades 
that have got shrapnel in them wrapped around butane containers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven of the victims were male and four were female. District  
Attorney Dave Thomas said there was no evidence that the killers 
targeted minorities, as some students claimed. Only one of the 13 
victims was black. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've only seen the photographs, but it appears to me that most  
of the victims were victims because of where they were at a 
particular time, not that they were sought out,'' Davis said. 
``Most of the victims were in the library, and that's where these 
two persons ended up. ... I don't know what the motive was other 
than anger. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixteen people remained hospitalized, 11 in critical or serious  
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Klebold's parents have not spoken to reporters, and Harris'  
parents issued a statement saying only: ``We want to express our 
heartfelt sympathy to the families of all the victims and to all 
the community for this senseless tragedy. Please say prayers for 
everyone touched by these terrible events.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said Harris and Klebold targeted athletes and  
minorities, laughing at their victims and using a racial epithet to 
describe the black victim. ``All jocks stand up!'' one of the boys 
yelled during Tuesday's attack. ``We're going to kill every one of 
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some students lay still and quiet on the floor, listening as the  
gunmen finished off the wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Classmates said the boys were outcasts who wore black, played  
war games and sometimes wore Nazi symbols. According to classmates, 
the boys admired Adolf Hitler and apparently picked his birthday 
for the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine student Brooks Brown, 18, said Harris had once  
threatened to kill him, but later had resumed their friendship. 
Brown said he saw Harris carrying a duffel bag as he walked into 
the school on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was walking out for a cigarette and I told him, `Hey, man,'  
and he said, `Brooks, I like you. Now, get out of here. Go home.''' 
Brown said. ``And so I didn't think twice about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris and Klebold had been through the juvenile detention  
system for property crimes in 1998 but completed a program that 
allows them to clear their record, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	While investigators continued their work, memorial services were  
held across the city Wednesday, and dozens of counselors offered 
support to grieving students, parents, friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hundred students from around the Denver area gathered at  
a park near the school Wednesday, many with their parents. Bouquets 
were scattered around the grounds. Students placed flowers and 
other mementos on a car driven to school Tuesday by one of the 
students believed to be killed. 
</P>
<P>
	A poster on a wall in the park near the school contained  
messages of condolence and scorn. 
</P>
<P>
	``These flowers and prayers are for the innocent victims and  
their families, not for the two monsters that committed these 
selfish and violent acts,'' the poster said. ``Who were you two to 
decide what should happen to these people? We're here for you, 
Columbine High School. Love, Arvada West.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Red-eyed students, including one girl wearing a T-shirt listing  
the names of Columbine's '99 senior class, streamed into the Light 
of the World Church for a memorial service and a noon prayer vigil. 
</P>
<P>
	``How can you reassure someone who has just seen devastation?''  
said Rochelle Brunsdon of the Jefferson Center for Mental Health. 
``We're going to talk to people about the experience they've had, 
how they can go on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the church, visitors placed flowers and cards at the  
base of a weathered 12-foot cross leaning sideways against a tree. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, the district attorney, said that during the rampage, a  
representative of Klebold's father called authorities and said the 
father was willing to help negotiate, but the offer was rejected 
because officials felt there was little he could do. 
</P>
<P>
	The massacre forced the closing of all schools in the Jefferson  
County school district, which has 89,000 students and is Colorado's 
largest. Rick Kaufman, a district spokesman, said all schools 
except Columbine would open again Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials were examining ways to get Columbine students into  
other schools, because it was uncertain the school would open again 
before the end of the school year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hockey's Colorado Avalanche postponed two playoff games in  
Denver this week, and baseball's Colorado Rockies on Wednesday 
called off their game for the second night in a row. Rockies 
players and coaches will wear a Columbine High patch on their 
sleeves for the rest of the season.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Rocket Launch Delayed Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- A popped circuit breaker late  
Wednesday forced Boeing to nix its third attempt to launch its new 
Delta III rocket. 
</P>
<P>
	Launch managers said they would try again Thursday night.  
</P>
<P>
	A computer command sent from the launch control center caused  
the circuit breaker at the pad to trip, officials said. That, in 
turn, prevented nitrogen gas from flowing into the rocket; nitrogen 
is needed to keep the instruments inside from freezing. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing spokesman Walt Rice said it was not immediately known  
whether someone made a mistake or whether the equipment 
malfunctioned. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing tried twice to launch the rocket with an Orion  
communications satellite two weeks ago, but had to halt the 
countdown, once because of high wind and again because of technical 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Delta III made its debut last August, it exploded in  
midair. Boeing traced the accident to a faulty computer program 
that's since been corrected.

<HEADLINE> 15 Dead in Colo. School Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Worried about bombs and booby traps,  
specially trained officers painstakingly checked thousands of 
lockers and castoff backpacks today in a suburban high school where 
15 people were killed in the deadliest U.S. school rampage on 
record. Close to 30 explosive devices were found. 
</P>
<P>
	Victims' bodies were left in the school overnight as agonized  
parents braced for the worst. Students streamed into Clement Park 
next to the school early today to leave flowers and share their 
feelings about the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helps to talk about it,'' said Brandon Reisbeck, a  
19-year-old senior who bolted from his choir class to safety after 
he heard gunshots Tuesday. Outside the Light of the World Church, 
visitors placed flowers and cards at the base of a weathered 
12-foot cross leaning sideways against a tree. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation was delayed by the thorough police sweep of  
the school, which was prompted by the discovery of bombs in the 
parking lot and on the bodies of the gunmen, said to be members of 
an outcast group with right-wing overtones called the Trenchcoat 
Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
	At midmorning today, sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said close  
to 30 explosive devices were found at the school, in the suspects' 
vehicles and possibly at their homes. Late Tuesday, more than 11 
hours after the shootings, a bomb on a timer blew up, but no one 
was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of these devices are on timing devices, some are  
incendiary devices and some are pipe bombs,'' Jefferson County 
Sheriff John Stone told ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' ``Some are 
like hand grenades that have got shrapnel in them wrapped around 
butane containers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After hours of confusion on the precise death toll, Davis put it  
at 15, including the two shooters. Four of the dead were women or 
girls, and at least one was believed to be a school staff member, 
he said. At one point, authorities had said up to 25 had died. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the victims were found underneath desks, in cubicles or  
in boxes, slain while apparently trying to hide, Davis said. 
Witnesses said that during the rampage, the two teen-agers in black 
trench coats laughed and hooted as they opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, students struggled to understand the tragedy.  
</P>
<P>
	Crystal Woodman, a junior who was in the library when the gunmen  
burst in, said this morning she can't get their voices out of her 
head. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were just, like, they thought it was funny,'' Woodman  
told ``Good Morning America.'' ``They were just, like `Who's next? 
Who's ready to die?' They were just, like, `We've waited to do this 
our whole lives.' And every time they'd shoot someone, they'd 
holler, like it was, like, exciting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the bodies were found in the library. The attackers  
marched in with guns and pipe bombs, demanding that ``all jocks 
stand up. We're going to kill every one of you,'' student Aaron 
Cohn said. 
</P>
<P>
	A gunman looked under a desk in the library and said  
``Peek-a-boo,'' then fired, Cohn said. Anyone who cried or moaned 
was shot again. One girl begged for her life, but a gunshot ended 
her cries. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohn said one killer put a pistol to his head but did not shoot  
him. Instead, he said, the shooter turned his attention to a black 
student, saying, ``I hate niggers.'' Cohn heard three shots but 
couldn't see what happened. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, frantic parents awaited word of their children,  
watching as busloads of tearful students were reunited with their 
families. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-three people were treated at hospitals, most of them with  
gunshot wounds. Sixteen teens remained hospitalized this morning, 
including five in critical condition and five others in serious 
condition. One teen suffered at least nine shrapnel and bullet 
wounds; she was in fair condition today. 
</P>
<P>
	Students and Denver media identified the gunmen as Eric Harris  
and Dylan Klebold. The two exchanged shots with police and were 
later found dead in the library with self-inflicted gunshot wounds 
and bombs around their bodies, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears to be a suicide mission,'' Stone said.  
</P>
<P>
	Both youths had two parents at home and came from families  
neighbors described as fine people. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were extremely bright, but not good students,'' said  
choir teacher Lee Andres. ``... They disliked authority. They did 
not like to be told what to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the motive was unclear, several students said Harris and  
Klebold were members of a group calling itself the ``Trenchcoat 
Mafia,'' outcasts who bragged about guns and bombs and hated blacks 
and Hispanics, as well as athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Police who searched Harris' home said they found bomb-making  
material. Students said the group was fascinated with World War II 
and the Nazis and noted that Tuesday was Adolf Hitler's birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair, wearing fatigues and ankle-length black coats, opened  
fire in the parking lot around 11:30 a.m. before entering the 
school cafeteria. Bullets ricocheted off lockers as students raced 
toward the exits. 
</P>
<P>
	Student Nick Foss saw one of the gunmen pull a sawed-off shotgun  
from under his coat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Finally I started figuring out these guys shot to kill for no  
reason,'' Foss said. The gunman ``didn't say anything. When he 
looked at me, the guy's eyes were just dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The killers fired as they walked into the cafeteria and  
continued shooting as they moved upstairs into the library. Cohn 
said he heard one girl begging for her life and then a bang. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were laughing after they shot. It was like they were  
having the time of their life,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of students hid in classrooms before escaping with the  
help of police in an armored car. Others were trapped for hours 
while SWAT teams searched for the gunmen and their bombs. Some had 
called their parents on cellular phones from inside the building to 
whisper they were OK. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of police officers from throughout the Denver area  
surrounded the school, which has 1,800 students. As TV images of 
the scene were broadcast nationwide, helicopter ambulances used a 
sports field as a landing pad, and officers in helmets and 
camouflage gear took cover behind squad cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Students who fled the building wept and held their hands above  
their heads while police frisked them. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, President Clinton said: ``Perhaps now America  
will wake up to the dimensions of this challenge, if it could 
happen in a place like Littleton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At an appearance today in Minneapolis, Attorney General Janet  
Reno said she may push to have more counselors in the nation's 
schools to avoid problems before they start. ``It is important for 
teachers, parents ... to have the resources they need to turn to,'' 
Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she may push to have more counselors in the nation's  
schools to avoid problems before they start. 
</P>
<P>
	Littleton is a suburb of 35,000 southwest of Denver, where  
farmland is rapidly disappearing beneath suburban sprawl and soccer 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
	Many parents gathered at a nearby elementary school and answered  
questions from investigators, who were trying to identify some of 
the victims based only on what they were wearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauri Senti waited 3 1/2 hours before she found her 14-year-old  
daughter, Ashley Steele, safe. Senti stayed at Leawood Elementary 
until late Tuesday to comfort other grieving parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody was walking around asking if you'd heard about their  
children,'' she said. ``You can't really say anything. You're just 
there for support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1997, a series of school shootings around the country have  
led to demands for stricter laws, tighter security and closer 
monitoring of troubled students. Two people were killed in an 
attack in Pearl, Miss., three in West Paducah, Ky., five in 
Jonesboro, Ark., and two in Springfield, Ore.

<HEADLINE> Exxon Reports Lower Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Weaker crude oil prices helped drive Exxon  
Corp.'s first-quarter profits down 40 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest oil company said Wednesday that excluding  
one-time charges, it earned $1.40 billion, or 47 cents per share, 
compared with $1.89 billion, or 76 cents per share, last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest quarter, Exxon had a $120 million charge for the  
restructuring of Japanese operations, while the prior year's 
quarter included a $70 million charge relating to an accounting 
change. 
</P>
<P>
	Including the charges, Exxon earned $1.02 billion, or 42 cents  
per share, compared to $1.82 billion, or 73 cents per share, a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon's results beat Wall Street estimates by a penny a share,  
according to First Call Corp. But in trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange, Exxon shares were down almost 3 percent, falling $2.31 1/4 
to close at $78.43 3/4 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue fell to $26.9 billion from $30 billion in the year-ago  
period. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil prices were about 20 percent lower during the quarter  
than they were a year ago, eating into the profits of all oil 
companies. Demand for oil has dropped because of weak economic 
conditions in Asia, Latin America, Russia and other parts of the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon said its earnings also were adversely affected by lower  
natural gas prices, weaker refining and chemicals profits and 
depressed copper and coal prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices for crude have been recovering in recent weeks, raising  
the prospects of a better second quarter for Exxon and other oil 
companies.

<HEADLINE>  `Trenchcoat Mafia' Were Outcasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- They called themselves the ``Trenchcoat  
Mafia,'' a dozen outcast students who hated blacks, Hispanics, Jews 
and athletes, and dressed up in long black dusters, like villains 
of the Old West. 
</P>
<P>
	They played World War II games, bragged about their guns, and  
razzed fellow students about kowtowing to the elite students at 
Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	But few students took them seriously until Tuesday, when police  
said two members of the rebellious group took out guns and started 
firing. 
</P>
<P>
	Classmates and Denver media identified the dead gunmen as Eric  
Harris and Dylan Klebold, both juniors at the school. Police 
refused to confirm the identities, but were seen at Harris' home, 
carrying out items including a computer. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``trenchcoats'' were seen as smart and computer-savvy,  
fellow students said. Harris lived in a tidy, two-story home on a 
quiet suburban cul-de-sac -- deserted today except for a steady 
stream of reporters driving through the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Sean Kelly, a 16-year-old junior, shared a computer lab with  
Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	``They just didn't seem to be all there. They liked things like  
Soldier of Fortune magazine,'' Kelly said. Harris made his own 
video production at school in which he bragged about some of his 
new guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said the two boys killed themselves following a  
``suicide mission'' in which they marched through the school, 
hurling pipe bombs and firing shotguns, leaving a trail of bodies. 
They said they learned of the group only after Tuesday's shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``School officials said they had no problems with the two  
suspects, there were no discipline problems,'' Jefferson County 
sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson County District Attorney Dave Thomas said today both  
shooters had a juvenile record, but nothing violent. ``They were 
involved in the same incident, which was theft and trespass to a 
car,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Trenchcoat Mafia members were questioned by police,  
including one who was led away in handcuffs Tuesday. But no arrests 
were made, Davis said, and there was no indication that any of the 
others took part in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly said members of the group made a number of ``generally  
derogatory remarks'' about Hispanics and blacks, and were 
considered outcasts by other students at the school. But officials 
said today that only one of the victims was black. 
</P>
<P>
	They had a long-running feud with some of the school's athletes,  
who enjoyed the popularity the Trenchcoats lacked. 
</P>
<P>
	``A couple of months ago, the jocks were supposed to fight  
them,'' said Matt Good, 16, a football player. But the Trenchcoats 
showed up two hours late, at the wrong spot, carrying swords and 
brass knuckles, and the fight was never rescheduled, Good said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1998 yearbook, a photo showed members of the group  
locking arms and smiling, was accompanied by the caption, ``Who 
says we're different? Insanity's healthy. ... Stay alive, stay 
different, stay crazy!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Morris, a leader of the group, is grinning broadly.  
</P>
<P>
	Klebold's sallow-faced picture appears on a separate page, with  
the statement: ``After going through many experiences in their 
lives, oftentimes students have regrets of past actions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Student Andrew Beard said members of the group often came to  
school in steel-toed combat boots, some of them wearing Nazi 
crosses. Tuesday was the anniversary of Adolf Hitler's birthday, 
and student Aaron Cohn said that was a significant day for 
Trenchcoat members, who would make references to 4-20. He said they 
often made anti-Semitic comments. 
</P>
<P>
	Beard said a dozen students joined the group last year, adopting  
the trademark dusters and sometimes wearing red or green berets, 
but the numbers dwindled to a half-dozen this year as the novelty 
wore off. He said he knew of no special significance for the 
dusters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dylan said he hated the jocks, and how they could walk over  
people and thought they were tough,'' Beard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Josh Nielsen, 17, a junior at the school, said he knew members  
of the group as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``They liked playing war games,'' he said. ``That's all they  
could talk about. They played war games and they liked to re-enact 
World War II battles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks Brown, who said he knew both gunmen, said he was walking  
out of school Tuesday morning when Harris warned him to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was walking out for a cigarette and I told him, `Hey, man'  
and he said, `Brooks, I like you. Now, get out of here. Go home.' 
And so I didn't think twice about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown told The Denver Post he and Harris had made up after a  
feud, but the boy was filled with hate. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did it because he hated people,'' Brown said. ``He loved  
the moment. He loved killing people, he liked that idea. He lived 
in that. That's how I knew it would end the way this did -- kill all 
the hostages and then themselves; I couldn't see anything else.''

<HEADLINE> Mustang Museum Plans Scrapped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Backers of a proposed museum to celebrate  
the Ford Mustang say they've abandoned the idea and are instead 
looking for an existing museum that wants to accommodate a 
collection of the popular sports coupe. 
</P>
<P>
	Late last year, the Mustang Museum Inc. board had narrowed its  
search for a museum location to Atlanta and Orlando, Fla. But the 
board announced Wednesday that the projected costs for a 
stand-alone museum were too high. 
</P>
<P>
	Board president Bill Dillard said the numbers simply didn't  
work. ``The fund-raising effort would have consumed the time and 
energy of hundreds of Mustang enthusiasts. In the end, we decided 
we'd rather devote our passion to the cars, not to fund-raising.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the plans changed, the board has reopened its search for a  
location. 
</P>
<P>
	``With 429 Mustang clubs nationwide, and 70,000 Mustang Club  
members, we think we have a lot to offer an established automotive 
museum,'' Dillard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford Motor Co. has supported the museum idea. Last year the  
automaker announced it would donate $1.5 million to the nonprofit 
museum group to assist in the fund-raising program. The museum's 
estimated cost was $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mustang marked its 35th anniversary last weekend. More than  
7 million Mustangs have been sold since its debut in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, 25 towns and cities from Detroit to Mustang, Okla.,  
put in proposals for the museum.

<HEADLINE> African Dancer Wins Elkhorn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- African Dancer charged between the leaders  
with less than a sixteenth of a mile to go today en route to 
victory in Keeneland's $109,900 Elkhorn Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Pin Oak Stable's 7-year-old son of Nijinsky II ran 1 1/2 miles on  
the turf in 2:27 4/5. It was the seventh win in 13 career starts 
for African Dancer, who increased his career earnings to $431,470. 
</P>
<P>
	Magest finished second, three-quarters of a length behind the  
winner and a head in front of Chorwon. It was two lengths back to 
Foreign Land in the field of eight 4-year-olds and up. 
</P>
<P>
	African Dancer, the 11-10 favorite, paid $4.20, $3 and $2.60.  
Magest, a 44-1 outsider, returned $18.40 and $6. Chorwon, who took 
the lead briefly in the stretch under Pat Day, paid $3.20 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	African Dancer has won at least one race each year dating back  
to 1995.

<HEADLINE>  Colo. School Checked for Booby Traps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Working around bodies still lying where  
they fell more than a day earlier, bomb squad officers checked 
lockers and backpacks for booby traps Wednesday as investigators 
tried to piece together one of the deadliest school massacres in 
U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen students and one teacher were killed at Columbine High  
School, most of them in the library. They included the two teen-age 
gunmen who laughed as they opened fire on their schoolmates 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunmen, Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, apparently  
shot themselves in the head. Officials were trying to determine if 
others were involved, and they questioned other members of the 
boys' dark group of outcasts, the ``Trenchcoat Mafia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities on Wednesday removed the bodies of two victims who  
died outside the building. Also, more than 24 hours after the 
attack, parents finally received official word of their children's 
fate. Police hoped to remove the other bodies later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators left the corpses in place overnight so that they  
could check for explosives and record the details of the crime 
scene, which SWAT members described as something from ``Dante's 
Inferno.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many bodies were sprawled on the floor, slumped in desks or  
crouched beneath tables, boxes and cubicles where they apparently 
tried to hide. Police found a handgun under one of the killers, and 
a semiautomatic rifle and two sawed-off shotguns elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a different sort of chaos inside,'' SWAT Sgt. George  
Hinkle said. ``There were fire alarms going off, strobe lights, 
four inches of water in the cafeteria. We had been told there were 
bombs in backpacks and there were backpacks everywhere. It was the 
toughest tactical problem I've ever seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said 30 explosive devices had  
been found at Columbine, in the killers' vehicles and at their 
homes. Late Tuesday, more than 10 hours after the shootings, a time 
bomb blew up, but no one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of these devices are on timing devices, some are  
incendiary devices and some are pipe bombs,'' Sheriff John Stone 
told ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' ``Some are like hand grenades 
that have got shrapnel in them wrapped around butane containers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven of the victims were male and four were female. District  
Attorney Dave Thomas said there was no evidence that the killers 
targeted minorities, as some students claimed. Only one of the 13 
victims was black. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've only seen the photographs, but it appears to me that most  
of the victims were victims because of where they were at a 
particular time, not that they were sought out,'' Davis said. 
``Most of the victims were in the library, and that's where these 
two persons ended up. ... I don't know what the motive was other 
than anger. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixteen people remained hospitalized, 11 in critical or serious  
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Klebold's parents have not spoken to reporters, and Harris'  
parents issued a statement saying only: ``We want to express our 
heartfelt sympathy to the families of all the victims and to all 
the community for this senseless tragedy. Please say prayers for 
everyone touched by these terrible events.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said Harris and Klebold targeted athletes and  
minorities, laughing at their victims and using a racial epithet to 
describe the black victim. ``All jocks stand up!'' one of the boys 
yelled during Tuesday's attack. ``We're going to kill every one of 
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some students lay still and quiet on the floor, listening as the  
gunmen finished off the wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Classmates said the boys were outcasts who wore black, played  
war games and sometimes wore Nazi symbols. According to classmates, 
the boys admired Adolf Hitler and apparently picked his birthday 
for the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine student Brooks Brown, 18, said Harris had once  
threatened to kill him, but later had resumed their friendship. 
Brown said he saw Harris carrying a duffel bag as he walked into 
the school on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was walking out for a cigarette and I told him, `Hey, man,'  
and he said, `Brooks, I like you. Now, get out of here. Go home.''' 
Brown said. ``And so I didn't think twice about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris and Klebold had been through the juvenile detention  
system for property crimes in 1998 but completed a program that 
allows them to clear their record, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	While investigators continued their work, memorial services were  
held across the city Wednesday, and dozens of counselors offered 
support to grieving students, parents, friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hundred students from around the Denver area gathered at  
a park near the school Wednesday, many with their parents. Bouquets 
were scattered around the grounds. Students placed flowers and 
other mementos on a car driven to school Tuesday by one of the 
students believed to be killed. 
</P>
<P>
	A poster on a wall in the park near the school contained  
messages of condolence and scorn. 
</P>
<P>
	``These flowers and prayers are for the innocent victims and  
their families, not for the two monsters that committed these 
selfish and violent acts,'' the poster said. ``Who were you two to 
decide what should happen to these people? We're here for you, 
Columbine High School. Love, Arvada West.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Red-eyed students, including one girl wearing a T-shirt listing  
the names of Columbine's '99 senior class, streamed into the Light 
of the World Church for a memorial service and a noon prayer vigil. 
</P>
<P>
	``How can you reassure someone who has just seen devastation?''  
said Rochelle Brunsdon of the Jefferson Center for Mental Health. 
``We're going to talk to people about the experience they've had, 
how they can go on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the church, visitors placed flowers and cards at the  
base of a weathered 12-foot cross leaning sideways against a tree. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, the district attorney, said that during the rampage, a  
representative of Klebold's father called authorities and said the 
father was willing to help negotiate, but the offer was rejected 
because officials felt there was little he could do. 
</P>
<P>
	The massacre forced the closing of all schools in the Jefferson  
County school district, which has 89,000 students and is Colorado's 
largest. Rick Kaufman, a district spokesman, said all schools 
except Columbine would open again Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials were examining ways to get Columbine students into  
other schools, because it was uncertain the school would open again 
before the end of the school year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hockey's Colorado Avalanche postponed two playoff games in  
Denver this week, and baseball's Colorado Rockies on Wednesday 
called off their game for the second night in a row. Rockies 
players and coaches will wear a Columbine High patch on their 
sleeves for the rest of the season.

<HEADLINE> GOP Lawmakers Want More College Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans are offering a plan to  
increase federal grants to low-income college students. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1 billion plan, which would add $400 to the $3,125 maximum  
amount that a low-income student can get under the annual Pell 
Grant program, sets the stage for this year's financing battle over 
education. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., chairman of the House Education and  
Workforce Committee, said Tuesday the plan would not exceed the 
caps put on spending for this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans want to increase spending in other federal student  
aid programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration's plan for fiscal 2000 would add $125  
to the grant maximum. But increases proposed by President Clinton, 
of 50 percent or more, were mostly for teacher-training, aid to 
Hispanic-serving colleges and GEAR UP, a college preparation 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president once again has listened to the pollsters,'' said  
Goodling, who contends Clinton favors his newer proposed programs 
over ``tried and true'' programs like the Pell Grants. ``He is 
meeting his political needs, not the real needs of students and 
educators.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has accused the GOP of pitting higher  
education against programs for children. The GOP plan ``ignores the 
importance of preparing students for college,'' said Education 
Secretary Richard W. Riley. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Diskey, Republican spokesman for the Education Committee,  
said the Republicans' higher education plan doesn't ask for any 
cuts in other programs, including Clinton priorities such as new 
teachers to reduce class sizes, school construction and 
after-school classes. 
</P>
<P>
	Crafting the spending bill, which includes a wide range of  
programs and must fall within the budget, will not be easy, said 
David Kohn, spokesman for Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., who oversees 
the House Appropriations subcommittee on education, health and 
labor spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``In general terms, Mr. Porter would agree with Mr. Goodling  
that support for higher education is the major priority for that 
bill,'' Kohn said.

<HEADLINE> Hard Realities of a New Music World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Years of sweat, years of dreams for Tim Arlon  
and his friends were captured on a three-inch silver disc. 
</P>
<P>
	The British native moved to the United States three years ago  
with the hope of becoming a rock 'n' roll star. He put together a 
band, Edenstreet, and they wrote some songs and methodically built 
an audience by playing the bars in and around Louisville, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
	Edenstreet was heard by the right people and signed a recording  
contract with a major label. Arlon will never forget the date: May 
30, 1997. Edenstreet continued performing, polishing its act, and 
recorded a debut album. Late last year the CD was manufactured and 
sent in advance to the press and other taste-makers. 
</P>
<P>
	Then three days before Edenstreet's first single was to be  
released this winter, their company, A&AMP;M Records, ceased to exist. 
</P>
<P>
	It was swallowed up by the corporate merger that created the  
Universal Music Group. Most of A&AMP;M's staff was fired, and a few 
were lucky enough to latch on to the new parent. The deal left 
Edenstreet and probably hundreds of other musical acts in a career 
limbo. 
</P>
<P>
	Edenstreet had played the rock 'n' roll game by the rules, only  
to find the rules had changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are five guys sitting in Louisville whose dreams have  
just been taken away on a whim,'' Arlon said. ``And it was so close 
-- just three days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their story is all too typical. The Cowboy Junkies, 10,000  
Maniacs and Robbie Fulks have similar stories to tell. All three 
were with Geffen Records, which was absorbed in the same merger as 
A&AMP;M. 10,000 Maniacs subsequently released an album on a small, 
independent label. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Edenstreet's bad luck to get into the music business at a  
time of fundamental change. The five big companies that control the 
industry and account for nearly 90 percent of its yearly sales -- 
Sony, Warner, EMI, BMG and Universal -- are becoming leaner and 
meaner in response to Wall Street's hunger for profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Artist rosters are being pared and acts that need a few years of  
nurturing are often dropped in favor of those who can hit it big 
quick, like a teen idol pop singer or Celine Dion. 
</P>
<P>
	Rock artists are particularly vulnerable because the genre, once  
the industry's unquestioned leader, has been steadily slipping in 
influence through the 1990s as a new generation grows up more 
interested in rap and rhythm 'n' blues. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucinda Williams, whose blend of rock, country, folk and blues  
made ``Car Wheels on a Gravel Road'' one of last year's most 
critically praised albums, summed up the bleak situation last month 
in her keynote speech at the South by Southwest music conference in 
Austin, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think major labels are working anymore,'' she said.  
``It was a good idea, but it kind of crumbled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edenstreet was attracted to A&AMP;M because of its reputation as a  
congenial place that had helped artists like The Police and Sheryl 
Crow grow. The label was partly founded by a musician, Herb Alpert, 
in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	Arlon and his mates loved it. They worked closely with A&AMP;M  
executives when making the record and were honored when A&AMP;M's 
chairman, Al Cafaro, flew to Louisville to see them perform. He 
told them he believed Edenstreet would be A&AMP;M's next big rock act. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know everyone uses the term `family' about A&AMP;M, but it  
really did feel unbelievable,'' Arlon said. ``It was a great time 
for everyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The album was supposed to be released last October but A&AMP;M  
postponed it until February. The fall is when a flood of music is 
released in anticipation of the holiday shopping season, and the 
company didn't want Edenstreet to be lost in the crush. The band 
shrugged off the delay. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the bad news came, reaching Arlon while he was visiting his  
family in England during the Christmas holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Through their manager, Edenstreet tried to contact executives at  
Interscope, which had taken over A&AMP;M's remaining assets. It took 
many phone calls before Edenstreet received something of a 
nonanswer: Interscope was reviewing its options and would get back 
to them in six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Not wanting that uncertainty and questioning whether Interscope  
was right for them, Edenstreet asked for and received a release. 
Armed with the completed CD, the band is now a free agent. In other 
words, unemployed. The group is free to get the CD out in some 
other fashion, either by signing a new deal with another record 
company or releasing it on its own. The latter is very expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	An Interscope spokeswoman didn't respond to requests for  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Arlon is amazed that a company would just toss aside an  
investment; he believed A&AMP;M spent as much as a million dollars on 
Edenstreet. Yet it's not unusual. It happens often enough that 
Billboard editor-in-chief Timothy White just began writing a column 
solely about albums that were recorded and then never released to 
the public, in the hope that someone will notice the struggling 
musicians who made them. Edenstreet and other musicians being cut 
adrift will ultimately decide the new rules of operation for the 
music industry and how they get their music heard. Some careers 
will undoubtedly be ruined, dreams of stardom deferred. 
</P>
<P>
	Many artists will land on smaller, independent music labels, a  
sector that is expected to grow in response to the higher-level 
convulsions. Generally, signing with an indie label means there is 
less of a chance the music will reach a wide audience; indies cater 
well to smaller niches. 
</P>
<P>
	Distribution of music through the Internet is also an option.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we'll see fewer outlets for artists,'' said  
Hillary Rosen, CEO of the Recording Industry Association of 
America. ``I think there will be, if anything, more outlets because 
there will be more opportunities. This (consolidation) is happening 
at the same time as the Internet is beginning to explode.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edenstreet isn't sure where it will land. It hurts too much to  
walk around Louisville now and run into fans who want to know when 
their album will be ready. Band members used to be able to promise, 
``It's coming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now they don't know what to say.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shock,'' Arlon said. ``I find it quite unbelievable.  
There are so many horror stories in rock 'n' roll and the 
entertainment business. It is ruthless, absolutely ruthless.''

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Pull Back / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures retreated Wednesday on  
the Chicago Board of Trade amid an improved planting picture. 
</P>
<P>
	Futures prices pulled back modestly from sharp gains made a day  
earlier, when forecasts called for showers into next week across 
much of the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	While soaking rains would keep farmers out of the fields for  
several days, most should be able to catch up during a dry period 
in the latter half of the week, agronomists said. 
</P>
<P>
	With some spring plantings already ahead of schedule and  
continued prospects for a weak export picture, those observations 
led to mild selling pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery fell 1 1/4 cents to $2.67 3/4 a bushel; May  
corn was unchanged at $2.24 a bushel; May oats rose 2 1/4 cents to 
$1.26 1/4 a bushel; May soybeans fell 1 3/4 cents to $4.93 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle fell 0.20 cent to 63.50 cents a pound; May  
feeder cattle fell 0.02 cent to 71.60 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
fell 0.25 cent to 55.72 cents a pound; July pork bellies fell 0.75 
cent to 54.70 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Identifying Dead Children Difficult </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUTTO, Texas (AP) -- The bodies of two young children, dumped  
like an unwanted burden at the base of a washed-out drainage ditch, 
left investigators asking the most elementary questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Police in Central Texas made a public appeal Tuesday night for  
help in identifying the little boy and girl, whom they say were 
murdered. 
</P>
<P>
	The Williamson County Sheriff's Department released sketches of  
the children, detailing bright eyes and soft, round faces. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were some of the most beautiful children I have ever  
seen,'' said Williamson County Sheriff Ed Richards. 
</P>
<P>
	How the children died was as much a mystery as their names.  
</P>
<P>
	``There was some obvious trauma, and they had been dead for  
several hours,'' Richards said, adding that preliminary autopsy 
results were expected today. 
</P>
<P>
	The corpses were spotted late Monday afternoon by a couple  
walking along the eastern bank of Brushy Creek, a quiet corridor of 
near-still water just outside Hutto, a cotton-farming town of 1,300 
about 20 miles north of Austin. 
</P>
<P>
	Bounded by an eroded 30-foot wall of muddy moss and a canopy of  
shade trees, the children's temporary grave was in some six inches 
of water near a grouping of small boulders. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators offered slightly revised descriptions of the  
children, pegging the girl's age at 2-4 years and the boy's at 1-3 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The children both were Caucasian, had light brown hair and were  
roughly three feet tall, ``almost identical in size,'' Richards 
said. He declined to speculate whether the children were related, 
in spite of their similar appearances in the sketches.

<HEADLINE> Brit Jobless Rate Stays at 4.6 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP)-- Britain's unemployment rate remained at 4.6 percent  
in March for the eighth consecutive month, the government said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of jobless people claiming welfare benefits, adjusted  
for seasonal economic factors, increased by 2,000. However, the 
change was not enough to affect the overall unemployment rate, the 
Office for National Statistics said. 
</P>
<P>
	Unemployment based on International Labor Organization  
standards, which include people not eligible for benefits, rose by 
a seasonally-adjusted 32,000 people during the three months from 
December to February. 
</P>
<P>
	Measured by the ILO standard, Britain's unemployment rate rose  
to 6.3 percent from 6.2 percent in the previous three-month period. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of people holding jobs, meanwhile, rose by 80,000  
from December to February to a level of 27.3 million, the highest 
on record.

<HEADLINE> Coca-Cola Reports Profit Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Coca-Cola Co.'s profit fell 13 percent in the  
first quarter, matching Wall Street expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline reported Wednesday was the fifth straight quarter in  
which net income dropped from the previous year for the world's 
biggest soft drink company whose results have been hurt by economic 
downturns in important overseas markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke reported net income of $747 million, or 30 cents per share,  
in the three months ended March 31, down from $857 million, or 34 
cents a share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest results include a gain of one cent a share due to  
foreign exchange fluctuations. Without that gain, its operating 
income of 29 cents a share matched the average estimate of analysts 
surveyed by First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Coca-Cola shares  
climbed 3.5 percent, rising $2.31 1/4 to $67.56 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Net operating revenues for the quarter were down 1 percent, to  
$4.43 billion from $4.46 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also reported that worldwide unit case volume  
dropped 1 percent compared with a 14 percent increase in the first 
quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	North American case volume was up 1.5 percent despite increasing  
retail prices on soft drinks. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the volume declines for the quarter were a 23 percent drop  
in the division that includes Russia, 5 percent in the southern 
Africa division and 10 percent in Brazil. The overall decline was 4 
percent in Latin America, which had a 19 percent volume gain in the 
first quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though global economic conditions are dampening our  
volume and earnings growth during the first part of this year, our 
long-term growth potential remains unchanged,'' said M. Douglas 
Ivester, chairman and chief executive. ``Our system has never been 
better equipped to convert that potential into long-term value.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ivester, who recently returned from meetings in Latin America,  
said Coca-Cola remains committed to the region and will continue 
investing there ``to enhance our business system during the current 
economic crisis.''

<HEADLINE> BankBoston Pay Ratio Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- BankBoston bigwigs are getting an unwelcome  
serving of Ben &AMP; Jerry's-style economics as a dissident 
shareholders' group asks the company to limit the ratio between the 
salaries of top executives and the rest of the work force. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vermont ice cream company drew attention in the 1980s for  
its progressive policy restricting the pay of top executives to no 
more than seven times that of the lowest-paid permanent worker. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade Inc. abandoned the rule in 1995. But at  
BankBoston Corp.'s annual meeting today, a resolution was to be 
introduced proposing that the company adopt a similar policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``To have such a wide discrepancy in pay is discouraging ... and  
it exacerbates the larger problem in the U.S. of inequality between 
the rich and poor,'' said Jennifer Ladd, a BankBoston stockholder 
who planned to present the resolution. ``There are many people who 
make a corporation work, but they don't all get valued in the same 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution calls for BankBoston to establish a cap on CEO  
compensation by making it a multiple of the compensation of the 
lowest-paid worker at the company. It does not specify what that 
multiple should be. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just asking them to put in place some sense of limits,''  
said Betsy Leondar-Wright, spokeswoman for United for a Fair 
Economy, the Boston-based advocacy group leading a movement to 
bring the issue of income gap into the board rooms of some of the 
nation's biggest companies. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, UFE's Responsible Wealth project has recruited  
shareholders to file resolutions at nine U.S. companies to examine 
the wage gaps within their labor forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 1990 and 1997, CEO salaries rose 86 percent, while the  
wages of factory workers rose 22 percent, according to the 
nonprofit UFE. 
</P>
<P>
	Business Week magazine recently reported that top executives  
earn 419 times the average wage of a blue-collar worker. The ratio 
was 42-to-1 in 1980, Leondar-Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
	At BankBoston, CEO Charles ``Chad'' Gifford made $2.96 million  
in salary and bonuses last year -- down from $3.6 million in 1997 -- 
according to company records. 
</P>
<P>
	Figures for the lowest-paid employee salaries were not  
available, and BankBoston representatives did not immediately 
return phone calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	In the proxy, BankBoston urges shareholders to vote against the  
salary resolution, saying the cap on CEO salary would ``restrict 
the corporation's ability to attract and retain the experienced and 
dedicated leaders necessary for its business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to BankBoston, similar resolutions have been filed  
on the proxies for AlliedSignal, AT&AMP;T Corp., BankAmerica Corp., 
Citigroup Inc., Computer Associates, General Electric Co., Huffy 
Corp. and R.R. Donnelley &AMP; Sons Co. 
</P>
<P>
	At General Electric's shareholder meeting on Wednesday in  
Cleveland, the company recommended that the proposal be rejected 
and it was supported by only 5 percent of the shares voted. 
</P>
<P>
	According to GE's records, chairman Jack Welch received a base  
salary of $2.8 million in 1998 and a bonus of $7.2 million, nearly 
$1 million in other compensation and stock options on 500,000 
shares that could be worth $63 million in 10 years based on a 10 
percent annual growth rate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is my salary too high? Somebody else will have to decide that,  
but this is a competitive marketplace,'' said Welch, who pointed 
out that many GE employees besides himself have benefited from 
stock options. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers of the Responsible Wealth project don't expect the  
resolutions to pass. But they're hoping the proposals spark thought 
among shareholders and company heads about the wages of all 
workers, Leondar-Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even a landslide against the proposal could still change the  
climate in the company by showing them (some) shareholders are 
upset about how executive compensation is being handled,'' she 
said.

<HEADLINE> U S West Posts Slim Gain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- First-quarter profits edged higher at the  
regional telephone company U S West as heavy investment in wireless 
and Internet operations offset a modest improvement in revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West earned $397 million in the three months ended March 31,  
a shade better than the same period last year, when the company 
earned $393 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest quarterly profit amounted to 78 cents per share,  
right in line with Wall Street projections and even with the 
per-share breakdown of 78 cents a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	First-quarter revenues grew 5.7 percent to nearly $3.2 billion,  
fueled by strong subscriber growth in wireless and data services. 
</P>
<P>
	Combined, subscribers for PCS calling and Internet access  
services rose by 95,000 to 450,000 during the first quarter, a 26.8 
percent gain from the end of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, U S West jumped 2.4  
percent, rising $1.31 1/4 to close at $56 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, U S West said its results were pressured by  
increased investment in wireless and online services, 
faster-growing segments of the telecommunications industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also cited spending to increase the electronic sales  
capabilities and improve network infrastructure. The spending is 
expected to ease later in the year, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our first quarter spending was well above last year,'' said  
Sol Trujillo, president and chief executive, who also noted costs 
related to efforts at gaining regulatory clearance. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the year, we expect to achieve our full-year growth of  
around 10 percent,'' said Trujillo.

<HEADLINE> Man Arrested at Anti-Abortion Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Police on Wednesday made their first  
arrest during a week-long series of anti-abortion protests when a 
man allegedly knelt on a sidewalk and pretended to shoot an 
imaginary gun at pickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers who seized the man found two military-style rifles and  
ammunition in his car. Police said the gunman appeared to have no 
links to activists on either side of the abortion issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Scores of anti-abortion protesters are in the area for Operation  
Save America, which is calling on supporters to come here and 
demonstrate. 
</P>
<P>
	James Krentel, 34, of Rochester, was held on charges of  
harassment and possessing a loaded weapon in a vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	The episode passed largely unnoticed a half-block from Genesee  
Hospital, where some 200 anti-abortion protesters were reciting 
hymns and prayers and holding placards aloft. 
</P>
<P>
	Alongside them, a smaller number of abortion rights activists  
chanted their opposition in slogans and song. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospital security guards told police Krentel appeared to be  
pointing a weapon at one of them as he drove by in a gray 
Oldsmobile, the police chief said. By the time police intervened, 
he was on his knees ``facing toward the protesters and simulating 
what appeared to be him holding a rifle,'' police Chief Robert 
Duffy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours later, police spokesman Carlos Garcia said that at no time  
did the weapons leave the back seat and that no weapon was pointed. 
</P>
<P>
	After three days of peaceful protest in Buffalo, Operation Save  
America switched its focus 75 miles east to Rochester for one day.

<HEADLINE> Books and Authors: Anne Lamott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Author Anne Lamott went to a flea market looking  
for bargains, greasy ethnic food and company. Across the street, 
she found God. 
</P>
<P>
	There, in a homely, ramshackle building with a cross on top and  
spirited gospel music that wafted out and pulled her inside, she 
also found an old woman with crushed hats, hallelujahs and plastic 
Baggies stuffed with dimes to help Lamott get through hard times. 
</P>
<P>
	The writer discovered at St. Andrew Presbyterian church in  
impoverished Marin City, Calif., a congregation with a strong civil 
rights influence that echoed the activism of her parents in the 
1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of all, she found a spiritual home where worshipers not  
only let her in but said, ``You come back now,'' and made her feel 
welcome even in the darkest of times. Times like the Sunday in 1984 
when she went to church after a week when she had an abortion, 
smoked dope and got drunk, then sick, bleeding for hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was so hung over that I couldn't stand up for the songs,''  
Lamott recalls in her new, best-selling book, ``Traveling Mercies: 
Some Thoughts on Faith.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In this sometimes irreverent series of essays on her devout but  
quirky spiritual journey, Lamott recalls growing up in a home where 
her bohemian, intellectual parents raised her ``to believe in 
books, music and nature,'' not God. Believing in God meant that you 
were stupid, ignorant, uncouth. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamott acknowledges at the start of her book that her walk of  
faith has been anything but straight: ``My coming to faith did not 
start with a leap but rather a series of staggers from what seemed 
like one safe place to another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Traveling Mercies'' is funny, sad and inspirational.  
</P>
<P>
	Lamott writes in a conversational style about her battles with  
alcoholism, drugs and bulimia. With self-effacing humor, she also 
deals with less extraordinary problems, from cellulite to the day 
she lost her temper when her 7-year-old son Sam tuned into ``Alvin 
and the Chipmunks'' on TV while she was trying to teach him about 
Ash Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The book, Lamott's eighth, abounds with literary allusions and  
references to pop culture. Lamott, who calls herself a ``left-wing, 
born-again Christian,'' packs Jesus, John Travolta, Nietzsche and 
dancer Judith Jamison all into the same sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	She sprinkles her pages with occasional expletives more typical  
of a David Mamet play and with images fit for a comedy club 
monologue. 
</P>
<P>
	She acknowledges her book is sometimes irreverent but says, ``I  
feel that God is the creator of just all that is beautiful and 
life-giving, and certainly that includes humor and the ability to 
laugh at oneself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lamott's walk of faith began as a child. She attended Catholic  
services with a playmate and later found comfort in a Christian 
Scientist's home. In college, she dabbled in Judaism and was 
tutored in phonetic Hebrew. She writes that people always thought 
she looked Jewish, or biracial because of her wiry hair and 
heavy-lidded eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not until Lamott was 30 and pregnant that she happened on  
St. Andrew while at a flea market, the place she liked to be when 
``hung over or coming down off a cocaine binge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two years later, in 1986, she sobered up. A year after that, she  
was baptized. And when she became pregnant again, the congregation 
persuaded her to keep the baby. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was at the end of my rope, the people at St. Andrew  
tied a knot in it for me and helped me hold on,'' writes Lamott, 
45. 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting in a Chicago hotel lobby for an interview, Lamott talked  
freely about herself. Her dark blond hair was twisted into 
dreadlocks; she wore jeans and a long-sleeve green cashmere sweater 
a friend gave her. She leaned over and touched the silk scarf of 
lavenders and greens draped loosely around her neck. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, this is Pammy's scarf,'' she said, referring to a friend  
who died of cancer and who appears in more than one of her books. 
``I wore it a long time because it smelled like her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Almost everything I have on someone gave me,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	She also was wearing a Tibetan prayer ring with a secret  
compartment. ``It's a little portable God box for me, so that when 
something's really troubling me ... then I write a little note'' to 
God and tuck it inside, she said. The ring is a wearable version of 
the little boxes she keeps at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Home is a tiny, hillside house in Marin County, Calif., with a  
buckeye maple tree that youngsters climb and ``windows everywhere'' 
in the upstairs living room. ``You feel like you're in a tree 
house,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamott, who has never married, lives there with her 9-year-old  
son their dog Sadie, a cat and a goldfish. The pet iguana is 
missing, presumed dead, she said gleefully. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamott, whose other books include ``Crooked Little Heart'' and  
``Bird by Bird,'' isn't sure if she will write another. For now, 
she is happy writing a column for the Internet magazine, Salon. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing she is sure about is that she doesn't want to drink  
again. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything I have, everything that works in my life,  
everything that's beautiful in my life is a direct result of 
sobriety,'' she said.

	Stocks End Up; Dow Gains 132.87  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices posted strong gains today as  
investors, reacting to encouraging earnings reports, returned to 
the Internet and pharmaceutical issues that were beaten down 
earlier this week. The Dow Jones industrials, which rallied 
strongly in the final 20 minutes of trading, rose 132.87 to close 
at 10,581.42. Broader stock indicators were pushed higher by the 
renewed interest in technology companies. The Nasdaq composite rose 
78.65 to 2,488.29. ``You're seeing a degree of strength today in 
many of the areas that were hit hard for the past week or more, and 
that strength is triggered by strength in earnings,'' said A. 
Marshall Acuff, market strategist at Salomon Smith Barney.

	IBM Earnings Jump 42 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- IBM's first-quarter earnings jumped 42 percent  
to $1.47 billion as software and service revenues surged, easily 
surpassing Wall Street projections. In the three months ended March 
31, International Business Machines Corp. earned $1.55 a share, 
compared to earnings of $1.03 billion, or $1.06 a share, in the 
same period a year ago. Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had 
predicted earnings of $1.41 a share for the Armonk, N.Y.-based 
company. First-quarter revenue surged 15 percent to $20.3 billion. 
While IBM officials credited software and service revenue for 60 
percent of their gross profit, the computer giant's report showed 
revenue strength across the board, and throughout the world. IBM 
stock finished up 2 1/8 at 171 7/8.

	Rubin Supports Economic Reform  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and other major economies  
have put together a ``powerful program of reform'' to deal with the 
worst economic crisis in 50 years and help to prevent future 
Asian-style currency crises, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said 
today. He said the United States and its allies want to more 
actively involve the private sector in dealing with crises and help 
developing countries avoid some of the pitfalls that triggered the 
recent turmoil. Rubin said that in upcoming meetings of finance 
officials from the world's seven richest industrial countries and 
the International Monetary Fund, the United States will be pushing 
reforms to help countries handle the huge amounts of money that can 
flow around the world with the click of a few computer keys.

	EU Won't Appeal WTO Banana Decision  
</P>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Union will not appeal a  
World Trade Organization's ruling that its banana import policies 
are illegal, officials announced today. The EU also is considering 
a ban on all U.S. beef starting June 15 because traces of growth 
hormones have been found in some imports. EU and U.S. officials 
will meet this week to discuss how the EU can bring its banana 
import policies into compliance with WTO rules and avoid fines 
Washington has been allowed to impose. A WTO panel ruled April 9 
the EU banana import system discriminated against imports of Latin 
American bananas in favor of imports from former European colonies 
in Africa and the Caribbean. The panel authorized the United States 
to impose sanctions of up to $191 million a year against the EU.

be the biggest corporate merger in history. The deal, which would 
create the world's second-largest telecommunications company, came 
after Telecom Italia's board of directors received assurances from 
the German government that it would not interfere with the new 
firm's business operations. A Telecom Italia official, speaking 
from Rome on condition of anonymity, confirmed that the company's 
board met today and approved a linkup of the two former state-run 
monopolies. Telecom's board was awaiting clarification on how the 
German government would reduce its controlling interest in what 
would be Europe's biggest telecommunications concern.

	Northrop Reports $104 Million Gain

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Northrop Grumman Corp. earned $104 million  
during the first quarter as increased sales by its Logicon 
information technology subsidiary offset declines in airplane

	Compaq Details Weak 1Q

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Compaq Computer revealed the financial details  
of a weak first-quarter that led to the removal of its CEO, but 
still left Wall Street wondering why the company stumbled so badly 
and how it would get back on track. Just days after the weekend 
ouster of chief executive Eckhard Pfeiffer, the world's biggest 
maker of personal computers posted a first-quarter profit of $281 
million, or 16 cents a share, meeting newly diminished forecasts. 
That's less than half of what had been predicted as recently as two 
weeks ago. The results reported today actually represented a sharp 
improvement from the first quarter of 1998, when Compaq earned $16 
million, or 1 cent a share. Compaq was up 1/4 24 1/4.

	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Weaker crude oil prices helped drive Exxon  
Corp.'s first-quarter profits down 40 percent. The nation's largest 
oil company said today that excluding one-time charges, it earned 
$1.40 billion, or 47 cents per share, compared with $1.89 billion, 
or 76 cents per share, last year. Including charges for 
restructuring Japanese operations, Exxon earned $1.02 billion, or 
42 cents per share, compared to $1.82 billion, or 73 cents per 
share, a year earlier. Exxon's results beat Wall Street estimates 
by a penny a share, according to First Call Corp. Exxon stock 
finished down 2 5/16 at 78 7/16.

	American, US Airways Earnings Fall  
</P>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- AMR Corp., the parent company of  
American Airlines, saw its earnings fall by 45 percent in the first 
quarter, hurt by a pilots' sickout that paralyzed the carrier in 
February. The company earned $158 million profit, or 96 cents a 
share, in the period ended March 31, compared with $290 million, or 
$1.62 a share, during the same period last year. The results still 
beat Wall Street's expectations. Revenues in the quarter were $4.48 
billion, down from $4.63 billion a year ago. The airline's results 
were hurt by a pilots' sickout in February that led to the 
cancellation of more than 6,700 flights. The 10-day job action 
stranded hundreds of thousands of passengers.

	U.S.-U.K. Aviation Talks To Resume  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Informal talks aimed at restarting formal  
negotiations over a new aviation agreement between the United 
States and the United Kingdom will begin next month. Negotiations 
over an ``open skies'' deal between the allies collapsed last fall 
after three days. Under the current agreement, only two U.S. 
carriers -- American Airlines and United Airlines -- can fly into 
London's Heathrow Airport. Under an open skies deal, an unlimited 
number of carriers could serve any U.S. or British airport. U.S. 
officials believe that added access to Heathrow would drive down 
airfares.

practices overseas. Shareholders can go to an Internet site called 
the Shareholder Activism Center, which describes itself as a 
financial information site for ``socially responsible'' investors. 
The project, announced today, was developed by the Interfaith 
Center on Corporate Responsibility, a New York-based group made up 
of some 200 religious institutional investors. Backers say the 
project grew out of a successful campaign last spring in which more 
than 2,000 people and groups sent letters to the Securities and 
Exchange Commission, pushing to give shareholders a bigger voice in 
how companies are run.

<HEADLINE> 5 Picked To Register Web Addresses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The organization that will manage much of the  
Internet selected five companies Wednesday, including America 
Online, to help consumers register Web addresses. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and  
Numbers represents an important 60-day experiment aimed at opening 
the worldwide computer network to capitalist competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers who want to register addresses now must pay at least  
$35 each year to Virginia-based Network Solutions Inc., which has 
enjoyed a lucrative exclusive agreement with the government since 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Under plans announced Wednesday, people can instead pay AOL or  
four other companies or continue doing business with Network 
Solutions, which also will continue to administer a master list of 
more than 4 million Web addresses ending in ``com,'' ``net'' or 
``org.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AOL Senior Vice President George Vradenburg called it ``an  
important step in the Internet's evolution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Seidman, who distributes an e-mail newsletter about AOL  
to 50,000 subscribers, predicted that the world's largest Internet 
provider will encourage its more than 17 million members to 
register vanity Web addresses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty easy to see that they'll try to get to the space  
of personal vanity Web site hosting,'' Seidman said. ``They have a 
huge infrastructure from a promotional point of view to support 
that. The opportunity for them is going to be huge. There, they'll 
have an advantage over anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for Network Solutions administering the master list  
of addresses, the five companies agreed to pay it a one-time fee of 
$100,000, plus $9 per year for each address they register. 
</P>
<P>
	That helped propel Network Solutions stock 53 percent higher  
Wednesday; it rose $32 to close at $92. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL hasn't decided what price it will ultimately charge  
consumers, spokesman Jim Whitney said, adding that ``questions of 
marketing, pricing, are all for down the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Network Solutions said it will continue charging $70 for the  
first two years, then $35 annually afterward. Another plan offered 
by the company costs $119 but includes other services. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. government announced last year it plans to largely end  
its management of the Internet and turn over control of most 
functions to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and 
Numbers, a California-based nonprofit group. 
</P>
<P>
	The government would still be responsible for assigning Internet  
addresses with the ``gov'' and ``mil'' suffixes for federal 
agencies and military institutions, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	The other four companies selected were the Internet Council of  
Registrars, France Telecom, Melbourne IT and Register.Com.

	Bodies Finally Removed From School  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The last of the bodies have been removed  
from a suburban Denver high school after Tuesday's shooting rampage 
that left 15 people dead -- including the two teen-age gunmen. 
Investigators left the bodies in place overnight at Columbine High 
School so that they could check for explosives and record the 
details of the crime scene. Sixteen people remained hospitalized, 
11 in critical or serious condition. Meanwhile, authorities were 
trying to determine if Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold acted alone or 
if others were involved. They questioned other members of the boys' 
dark group of outcasts, the ``Trenchcoat Mafia.''

	NATO May Reassess Yugoslavia Campaign  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A White House official said NATO may soon seek  
to update its assessment -- made last October -- that the campaign in 
Yugoslavia should be limited to air power. Another official said 
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana has given the go-ahead to U.S. 
Army Gen. Wesley Clark, supreme commander of NATO forces in Europe, 
for the new assessment. Meanwhile, Slovakia and the Czech Republic 
gave permission Wednesday to use their roads, railways and airports 
to ferry troops and equipment for the campaign against Yugoslavia. 
That would allow NATO to move troops from Germany to Hungary, the 
only NATO member bordering Yugoslavia.

	U.S. Apaches Arrive in Albania  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- With NATO missiles striking Belgrade  
night and day, the first Apache attack helicopters touched down in 
Albania today. The arrival of the U.S. anti-tank helicopters 
represents a significant boost in NATO's capability to destroy 
Yugoslav tanks and troops blamed for atrocities against Kosovo 
Albanian civilians. NATO says the Apaches could be sent into Kosovo 
by next week.

	NATO Prepares for Celebration  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Leaders from 42 countries will begin arriving  
in Washington Thursday for meetings marking NATO's 50th 
anniversary. NATO is now 50 years old and -- unlike the Soviet Union 
it was formed to contain -- still counting. With NATO, the United 
States and fellow members resolved that an attack on one member 
``shall be considered an attack on all.'' It's a principle that, 
with NATO's recent expansion, now connects the likes of Budapest 
and Baltimore in a binding commitment to the territory of 19 member 
states.

	CIA: China Stole US Weapons Secrets  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Through aggressive spying, China obtained  
classified information on a variety of U.S. nuclear weapons, U.S. 
intelligence officials told Congress today. Administration 
officials disclosed for the first time that China gathered 
classified information not just on the W-88 warhead and the neutron 
bomb but on ``several'' modern U.S. warheads, making it possible 
for Beijing to modernize its arsenal in the next few years. 
President Clinton ordered a review to assess potential 
vulnerability to espionage beyond the U.S. nuclear weapons 
laboratories.

	Yeltsin Fails To Oust Top Prosecutor  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- President Boris Yeltsin failed again Wednesday in  
his months-long bid to oust Russia's top prosecutor when 
parliament's upper house refused to approve his dismissal. 
Prosecutor General Yuri Skuratov's supporters portray him as a 
crusader for rooting out alleged bribe-taking in the Kremlin, while 
his opponents say he's the one who's corrupt. The removal of 
Russia's prosecutor general must be approved by the upper house of 
parliament.

U.S. businesses have spent $1 trillion over three decades to clean

their way to a 5-3 playoff victory over Anaheim Wednesday night, 
with Steve Yzerman getting a hat trick. Wendel Clark, acquired at 
the trade deadline, added a goal and an assist and Doug Brown also 
scored. Paul Kariya had a goal and two assists for the Ducks and 
Marty McInnis and Teemu Selanne scored. The Red Wings are 
attempting to become the first team to win three straight Stanley 
Cups since the New York Islanders won four in a row from 1980-83.

<HEADLINE> Knight Investigated in B.I.G. Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Imprisoned Death Row Records founder Marion  
``Suge'' Knight is under investigation in the slaying of rap star 
The Notorious B.I.G., who was gunned down outside a music industry 
party two years ago, police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Search warrants were served Tuesday at the record label's  
headquarters and other locations, and a vehicle owned by the 
company was seized. There were no arrests and no charges have been 
filed. 
</P>
<P>
	Police would not say what pointed the investigation to Knight,  
who is in prison for violating his probation in a 1992 attack on 
two rappers in a Hollywood studio. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was in custody at the time so he didn't pull the trigger,''  
said Lt. Al Michelena of the Police Department's robbery-homicide 
unit. ``We are investigating the possibility of him being 
implicated in this. We would certainly consider him a possible 
suspect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate comment from Knight's lawyer, David  
Kenner. A telephone message requesting comment was left at the 
attorney's office Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Michelena would not discuss a possible motive. He said  
affidavits that led a judge to sign the search warrants state 
probable cause but those documents were sealed. 
</P>
<P>
	Death Row became a major rap label, featuring Tupac Shakur,  
Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre. But the company is now struggling. 
</P>
<P>
	Shakur was fatally shot while driving with Knight in Las Vegas,  
and Snoop Doggy Dogg and co-founder Dr. Dre have left Death Row. 
</P>
<P>
	The Notorious B.I.G., whose real name was Christopher Wallace,  
was shot while sitting in a GMC Suburban after leaving a March 9, 
1997, party at the Petersen Auto Museum. The killer was in another 
car and got away. 
</P>
<P>
	The car seized Tuesday is a dark, metallic purple Chevrolet  
Impala. Michelena said it matches the description of the car used 
by the killer. 
</P>
<P>
	The car is owned by the company but hasn't been registered for  
``the last couple of years'' and is believed to have not been in 
use, Michelena said. 
</P>
<P>
	Adversarial relations between Death Row and Wallace's producer,  
New York-based Bad Boy Entertainment, were no secret. 
</P>
<P>
	Shakur publicly accused Wallace and others at Bad Boy of being  
involved in a 1994 robbery in which Shakur was shot several times 
and lost $40,000 in jewelry.

<HEADLINE> Hank Aaron Reigns as Career HR King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With the death last month of Joe DiMaggio, a  
recent poll chose Willie Mays as the greatest living ball player. 
Hank Aaron, who hit almost 400 more home runs than DiMaggio and 95 
more than Mays, has no problem with that. 
</P>
<P>
	``They voted DiMaggio the greatest,'' Aaron said. ``That's fine.  
Now it's Willie. That's fine, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's Aaron's style. He is at peace with himself, content that  
his performance, including the record 755 home runs and the record 
2,297 RBIs, speaks for itself. 
</P>
<P>
	He never had more than 47 home runs in a season, almost ordinary  
compared to Mark McGwire's 70 and Sammy Sosa's 66 last summer. But 
he reached 40 homers eight times and was in the 30s seven times. 
</P>
<P>
	He never drove in more than 132 runs in a season, far from Hack  
Wilson's record 190 and Lou Gehrig's 184. But he had 11 seasons of 
100 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did what I did,'' Aaron said. ``What I loved about what I  
did was the consistency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And consistency, he said, is what it will take to break the home  
run mark, celebrated more now than it ever was 25 years ago, when 
he broke Babe Ruth's mark of 714. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron has become a hot item.  
</P>
<P>
	There's a new award carrying his name that will go to baseball's  
best hitter and a slick new photo book published by Total Sports 
reflecting on his life and his achievement. President Clinton 
attended his 65th birthday party and invited him to visit the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it was the McGwire-Sosa home run chase that reminded fans  
about the exclamation point a home run provides. Aaron was the No. 
1 practitioner of baseball's slam dunk. 
</P>
<P>
	But he doesn't make a big deal over all those long balls he hit  
so long ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was able to do some things I'm proud of,'' he said. ``I was  
able to score a lot of runs. I never struck out 100 times in a 
season. One thing I did was hit 755 home runs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It stands alone as baseball's most glamorous record, eloquent  
testimony to a career of year-in, year-out excellence. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron believes the best chance of challenging the record belongs  
to Ken Griffey Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's 29 and he has 350,'' Aaron said. ``If he keeps doing what  
he's doing, he can break it. It will take a ballplayer an awful 
long time having good years to hit 755. I played a long time. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some ways, he's the same way I was, playing in a small  
city. Last year, not many people know he hit more than 50 homers. 
He's done that two or three years now. It's a question of whether 
he stays focused or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was not a particular challenge for Aaron.  
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't hard for me,'' he said. ``Each night I went home and  
looked at a table with three kids to feed. That kept me focused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the McGwire-Sosa chase to break Roger Maris' record of 61  
home runs, there was no festive side to Aaron's pursuit of the home 
run record. His run at Ruth was tinged with ugly racial overtones 
and, in the end, it was less celebrated than it was acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
	Number 715 was accompanied by relief rather than joy about the  
achievement. The scars of that time are buried in the deepest part 
of his psyche now, overshadowed by the good times he now enjoys. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, though, he remembers.  
</P>
<P>
	``McGwire, every time he hit a homer, he raised his son,'' he  
said, recalling the home plate greeting that became a ritual 
between father and son. ``I was unable to do that. If I had, how 
wonderful it would have been.''

<HEADLINE> School Gunman Loved German Insignia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Columbine High School gunman Eric Harris  
wore German insignia, spoke German in the hallways to his friend 
Dylan Klebold, and was passionate about ``death match'' computer 
games and his guns. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was into combat more than anyone else I've ever seen,''  
said Andrew Beard, a fellow student. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Harris and Klebold died in a suicide attack on  
fellow students in which they fired guns and tossed explosives. 
They were found dead of self-inflicted gunshot wounds in the school 
library. 
</P>
<P>
	Beard said Harris would come to class in steel-toed combat boots  
and a German cross. Harris was also said to be a big fan of 
Rammstein, a German industrial, or techno, rock band. 
</P>
<P>
	Beard said when students were asked to write out their wills as  
part of a class assignment, Harris told him that he planned to go 
into the military. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1993 to 1996, Harris lived at the Air Force base in  
Plattsburgh, N.Y., where his father, Wayne Harris, was a pilot, 
according to the Plattsburgh Press-Republican. Neighbors in 
Littleton said he is retired. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mouth just dropped,'' Eric Harris' former classmate Kyle  
Ross told the newspaper. ``He was a typical kid. He didn't seem 
anything like what is portrayed on TV.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Family members said Wednesday they were devastated by the  
shootings. In a statement, they said: ``We want to express our 
heartfelt sympathy to the families of all the victims and to all 
the community for this senseless tragedy. Please say prayers (for) 
everyone touched by these terrible events. The Harris family is 
devastated by the deaths of the Columbine High students and is 
mourning the death of their youngest son, Eric.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nick Baumgart, 17, another friend, said Harris was very smart  
and respectful of teachers. He said Harris recently became 
interested in fireworks. ``He worked at a fireworks stand, and he 
made sure he got paid in fireworks,'' Baumgart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jessie Boyer Jr., a former friend, said he was surprised when  
Harris criticized ``jocks'' because Harris was very sportsminded. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was an upbeat guy, but something changed. He associated  
himself with Nazis, and listened to a techno-Nazi band,'' Boyer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boyer also said he got upset when he heard Harris use racial  
epithets, but he said a black friend took no offense. ``He thought 
nothing of it,'' Boyer said. ``He thought they were joking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris and Klebold would speak German to each other in the  
hallway and talked a lot about World War II, Hitler and the Nazis, 
said Harris' neighbor Matt Good, 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Their strange dress, their fondness for Hitler -- schoolmate  
Aaron Cohn assumed it was because they felt left out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody was paying attention to them. They wanted attention,''  
Cohn said.

<HEADLINE> Starr Promotes Three Staff Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a sign that his Washington office won't  
shut down soon, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr promoted three 
members of his staff on Wednesday, including the key prosecutor in 
a controversial 11-hour confrontation with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr named three new deputies, elevating prosecutors Jay  
Apperson, Edward J. Page and Michael Emmick. 
</P>
<P>
	All three of the previous deputies in Starr's Washington  
operation left as the Lewinsky investigation wound down. 
</P>
<P>
	Emmick was the lead prosecutor assigned to try to persuade the  
former intern to cooperate with Starr's office in her initial 
encounter with investigators on Jan. 16, 1998, in a hotel outside 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Emmick's conduct has come under criticism because he discussed a  
possible immunity deal with Ms. Lewinsky without her attorney 
present. U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson concluded that 
Starr's office ``may have acted improperly'' in the matter. The 
Justice Department has advised Starr's office that it intends to 
investigate his handling of the Lewinsky case. 
</P>
<P>
	Before joining Starr in 1997, Emmick was chief of the  
30-attorney public corruption and government fraud section of the 
U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Apperson is lead counsel in the prosecution of longtime Clinton  
friend Webster Hubbell for allegedly concealing his own and Hillary 
Rodham Clinton's roles in a fraudulent Arkansas land development. 
With the Justice Department for 13 years, Apperson pioneered the 
use of civil procedures for recovering drug money paid to criminal 
defense lawyers, Starr said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	Apperson also was on the investigative team of a House  
subcommittee chaired by Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., that looked 
into the alleged use of the Clinton White House's computer for 
political purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Page went to Starr's office from the staff of another  
independent counsel, David Barrett, who is prosecuting former 
Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros. Before 
that, Page spent eight years with the U.S. attorney's office in 
Tampa, Fla., where he was chief of the major crimes section. 
</P>
<P>
	The three departing deputies in Starr's office, Robert Bittman,  
Solomon Wisenberg and Jackie Bennett, all participated in the grand 
jury questioning of President Clinton Aug. 17 when he admitted -- 
after eight months of denials -- that he had inappropriate intimate 
contact with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr has raised the possibility he might turn over parts of his  
criminal investigation to the Justice Department when the 
independent counsel law expires June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Pending before Starr's office are two trials involving Hubbell,  
as well as a May 3 trial of a Virginia woman, Julie Hiatt Steele, 
who was charged with obstructing Starr's investigation of Kathleen 
Willey's claim that Clinton made an unwelcome advance on her in the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators also have to complete their probes of the FBI  
files controversy and the White House travel office firings. 
Starr's office also could decide to retry Susan McDougal on charges 
of criminal contempt for her refusals to give grand jury testimony 
in the Whitewater probe. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr declines to say how long he plans to stay on the job.

<HEADLINE> Trainer Charlie Whittingham Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- At 73, Charlie Whittingham became the oldest  
trainer to saddle a Kentucky Derby winner. That record stood just 
three years, when Whittingham returned to the winner's circle at 
Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	A Hall of Fame trainer, Whittingham died Tuesday of leukemia. He  
was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Until this week, the three-time Eclipse Award winner showed up  
at the track at 4 a.m. every day and worked with the horses, 
continuing his routine of more than six decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess he'd been around horses all his life and through trial  
and error you learn how to deal with them and get through to them 
and think like they do and get the most out of them,'' said Bill 
Shoemaker, racing's all-time leading jockey who also became a 
trainer. 
</P>
<P>
	A crusty ex-Marine with a quick wit and sharp tongue,  
Whittingham's career spanned 62 years. He prepared more than 2,500 
winners, with two of the greatest being Kentucky Derby winners 
Ferdinand (1986) and Sunday Silence (1989). Ferdinand made him the 
oldest trainer to win the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	He was oldest again at 76 when Patrick Valenzuela rode Sunday  
Silence, who also won the 1989 Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	After two of his colts were Kentucky Derby disappointments in  
the 1950s, Whittingham decided to stay away from the race until he 
had a chance to win. That absence lasted 26 years. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to Churchill Downs with Ferdinand, ridden by  
Shoemaker, jockey for Whittingham on more than 200 stakes 
victories. Riding Ferdinand at 54, he became the Kentucky Derby's 
oldest winning rider. 
</P>
<P>
	``He liked the way I handled the horses and got the run out of  
them, didn't abuse them or override them. And I liked the way he 
trained 'em,'' Shoemaker said Tuesday. ``We had a good chemistry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shoemaker recalled that Whittingham brought him to see Ferdinand  
as a 2-year-old, before the horse had been raced. 
</P>
<P>
	``He took me around to his stall and there was a big chestnut,  
beautiful colt in the stall and he said, `We're going to have some 
fun with this horse. I think that we'll probably win the Derby with 
him.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Whittingham was taken from his home in suburban Sierra Madre by  
ambulance to Saint Luke Medical Center in Pasadena at 6:30 a.m. 
Tuesday. He died about 8:30 a.m., said his widow, Peggy.

	``We had a birthday party for him last week. And he was able to  
go to the races on Sunday, when he had two horses running,'' Mrs. 
Whittingham said. ``The doctor told me that sometimes when you get 
an infection like leukemia, the system just can't fight it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the owners whose horses Whittingham trained is Burt  
Bacharach, the composer-singer of numerous hit songs. 
</P>
<P>
	One day Bacharach didn't like the way one of his horses ran, and  
he asked Whittingham if the animal needed to be wormed. 
</P>
<P>
	Whittingham's reply, Jay Hovdey wrote in the 1993 book,  
``Whittingham: The Story of Thoroughbred Racing Legend,'' was 
itself legendary: 
</P>
<P>
	``Burt, I haven't heard too many hit songs coming out of your  
piano lately. Maybe you need to get that piano wormed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whittingham's son and fellow trainer, Michael, took over most of  
the direction of the Whittingham barn in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	Born April 13, 1913, in San Diego, Whittingham was inducted into  
racing's Hall of Fame in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	Other champions he sent to the post included: Porterhouse,  
champion 2-year-old, 1953; sprinter Ack Ack, Horse of the Year, 
1971; filly Turkish Trousers, champion 3-year-old, 1971; Cougar, 
turf champion, 1972; Perrault, turf champion, 1982; Estrapade, 
female turf champion, 1986; Miss Alleged, female turf champion, 
1991, and Flawlessly, female turf champion, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Whittingham won thoroughbred racing Eclipse Awards as top  
trainer in 1971, 1982 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	He held the national earnings title seven times, from 1970-73,  
1975 and 1981-82. His top earnings year was 1989 -- $11.4 million. 
More than 20 of the horses he trained topped $1 million in career 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	He was also the leading career trainer at Santa Anita and  
Hollywood Park. On Feb. 9, 1987, he became one of only five 
trainers to win four races in a day at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
	His training career began in the 1930s but was interrupted by  
World War II. He saw action with the Marine Corps at Guadalcanal, 
where he contracted malaria, 
</P>
<P>
	In 1946, Whittingham went to work as an assistant to trainer  
Horatio Luro in New York. Two years later, he split with Luro and 
went on his own.

<HEADLINE> SW Missouri Hires Hinson As Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) -- Barry Hinson, coach at Oral Roberts for  
two years, was hired as basketball coach at Southwest Missouri on 
Wednesday, a job he said he accepted with pride, even knowing it 
was turned down by someone else. 
</P>
<P>
	Hinson, who won a reputation as an aggressive coach and a sharp  
dresser during two seasons at Oral Roberts, displayed both traits 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Striding quickly to the center of the Hammons Student Center  
alumni lounge after a brief introduction, the new coach said he 
breathed a sigh of relief when he saw the podium was a short one. 
It would be just right, he added, for a short basketball coach, 
someone who at 5-feet-8 had feared he would have to stand on a 
phone book to introduce himself as Steve Alford's successor. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Hinson, dressed in a stylish, blue, pinstriped suit,  
launched into a fast-paced, 45-minute explanation of himself, 
bouncing up and down and waving his arms at times as he 
acknowledged that he is ``a little bit hyper.'' He said to expect 
the same kind of team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a very aggressive person. As you can tell,'' he added to  
much laughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Of his team's defensive style: ``We're going to dive for loose  
balls, draw charging fouls.'' In short, play the same way he does 
in pickup games with friends. 
</P>
<P>
	As for offense, he said simply: ``I like to shoot the 3.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Kevin Ault is going to love me,'' he said of the team's senior  
guard, who has a chance to break the school's record for 3-pointers 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hinson's Oral Roberts teams led the Mid-Continent Conference in  
scoring the past two seasons, putting up 77.9 points a game this 
year. They also led the conference in field goal percentage (48.4 
percent) and 3-point percentage (38.2 percent). 
</P>
<P>
	He was 36-23 in two seasons, his team finishing second in the  
conference in 1998 and tying Valparaiso for first this year. He was 
an assistant at Oral Roberts the four previous seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Alford, 78-58 in four seasons at Southwest Missouri, resigned  
last month to become coach at Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The Southwest Missouri job was offered to and accepted by  
Appalachian State's Buzz Peterson, but he backed out the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to talk about guys who came in here and turned  
this job down,'' Hinson snapped. When he interviewed for the 
position on Sunday, he said, ``I slammed my fist on the table and 
said, `I want this job.''' 
</P>
<P>
	He signed a four-year contract paying him $100,000 a season and  
guaranteeing at least $50,000 more for radio and TV work. He'll 
also receive a country club membership, use of a car, use of the 
school's Hammons Student Center for summer basketball camps, and 
various cash incentives for taking the team to a conference 
championship or to the NCAA tournament.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises Against the Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen Wednesday as  
fearful traders took heed of the International Monetary Fund's 
forecast that Japan's economy would fall further than earlier 
predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro fell to yet another record low, its continued downward  
trajectory triggered by the IMF's low expectations for growth in 
Europe and the continued conflict in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0611, down  
from $1.0624 late Tuesday. During trading, the euro fell to 
$1.0575, its lowest level since it began trading in January on 
behalf of 11 European nations. The dollar was worth 119.73 Japanese 
yen, up from 118.78 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF, which issued its forecast Tuesday, said Japan's economy  
will shrink 1.4 percent, double its decline in 1998, and a worse 
forecast than it made in December, when the IMF said Japan's gross 
domestic product would drop 0.5 percent in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``Japan's economy remains weak, and resumption of self  
sustaining growth is not yet clearly in sight,'' the IMF said. That 
contrasted with a prediction of 3.3 percent growth in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the forecasts came out, ``it was as if all the yen bulls  
had disappeared, with the market particularly focusing again on the 
weak economic fundamentals,'' said Kathleen Stephansen, a senior 
economist at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Securities Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	There also was an underlying fear that the government would  
intervene if the yen rose too much. Japanese officials have been 
saying as much. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the euro has fallen practically since its first trade  
at the beginning of January. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very much a situation where there are a lot of factors  
weighing against the euro,'' Stephansen said, including the 
fighting in Kosovo and U.S. growth projected higher than European 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 1.5073 Swiss francs, up from 1.5063,  
and 1.4868 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4906. The British pound 
was quoted at $1.6064, down from $1.6098. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro no  
longer are traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed 
rate. Based on Tuesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8433 
German marks, up from 1.8409; 6.1805 French francs, up from 6.1728; 
and 1,824.82 Italian lire, up from 1,821.49.

<HEADLINE> The Price of the American Dream </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Buying into the American Dream has a price,  
especially when the cost is measured in terms of who wins and who 
loses. 
</P>
<P>
	Sports metaphors abound in ``That Championship Season,'' Jason  
Miller's still potent drama about a 20th-anniversary reunion of 
high school basketball champions. 
</P>
<P>
	A recipient of the Pulitzer Prize and a Broadway success in  
1972, ``That Championship Season'' is an old-fashioned play, 
realistic and talky. Yet it is highly effective, particularly when 
cast with five actors who can handle its frequent dramatic 
explosions. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortunately, off-Broadway's Second Stage, now in its handsome  
new theater constructed inside an old bank on Eighth Avenue and 
43rd Street, has found a quintet of fine performers who fill the 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief among them is James Gammon, a veteran of Sam Shepard plays  
in which he usually portrays grizzled crazies. Here, he plays the 
Coach, a man who lives by rules that no longer apply, if they ever 
did. A rigid, didactic, even bigoted individual, the Coach believes 
in winning as the standard by which all should be judged. Capturing 
the Pennsylvania high school basketball championship in 1952 
defined his career -- and his life. 
</P>
<P>
	Gammon brings this uncompromising man to life. He growls around  
the living room of the Coach's old house in a coal-mining town in 
northeastern Pennsylvania. His boys, despite their winning ways two 
decades earlier, now are having doubts about their later 
accomplishments in life. 
</P>
<P>
	They are a microcosm of types, yet Miller manages to flesh them  
out, making them into credible people overwhelmed by mid-life 
crises. One (Ray Baker) is the mayor, sensitive but a bit of a 
boob. His reelection is threatened by an aggressive challenger who 
plans to expose the man's predilection for patronage. Another 
(Dennis Boutsikaris) is a successful businessman, the area's 
strip-mine king, whose contributions to the mayor have helped 
deflect attacks on his polluting of the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	A third (Dylan Baker) is a teacher, a frustrated, angry man who  
always has done the right thing. Whether looking after his wife and 
kids or rescuing his alcoholic brother after yet another fall from 
the wagon, he has put duty above self for too long a time. 
</P>
<P>
	The alcoholic brother (Michael O'Keefe) also played on the  
fabled basketball squad. Despite living in a boozy haze, he is the 
one member of the team who remembers things clearly -- and wonders 
why Martin, the fifth player, has never shown up for any of their 
reunions. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Keefe does something special with a character who could be  
just a stereotype. The actor makes the man all the more 
heartbreaking, conveying the fact that the guy knows he hasn't 
lived up to his considerable potential. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, it is their youthful success that binds these  
troubled guys together. Their shining silver trophy, sitting in the 
Coach's living room, reminds them of what they once were. The Coach 
laments the loss of leaders, men he admired such as Gen. George 
Patton, President Kennedy and Sen. Joseph McCarthy. Since then, 
there have been no heroes. 
</P>
<P>
	Director Scott Ellis handles the multitude of regrets and  
recriminations with considerable skill, never letting the evening 
become shrill or overly argumentative. 
</P>
<P>
	But then, despite its toughness, Miller's play is surprisingly  
reflective. More than a quarter-century after it was written, 
``That Championship Season'' remains a strong piece of theater, a 
rueful reminder that early glory doesn't automatically guarantee 
future success.

<HEADLINE> Hootie Plans Include Third Album </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hootie and the Blowfish is bouncing back from  
backlash and sophomore slump with a third album, ``Musical 
Chairs,'' and a lot of touring. 
</P>
<P>
	Hootie's 1994 debut album, ``Cracked Rear View,'' sold 15  
million. But its second, ``Fairweather Johnson,'' released two 
years later, sold only 3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The backlash that Hootie endured after ``Cracked Rear View''  
came as no surprise. ``It is like everything in life,'' said 
guitarist Mark Bryan. ``With that much success, there is going to 
be a downside. You can't have 15 million sales without having some 
detractors as well. We weren't going to quit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some comments were hurtful.  
</P>
<P>
	``People are entitled to their opinions. There's certainly music  
I don't like. I don't expect everybody to like ours,'' Bryan said. 
``Some people said we'd sold out. That was upsetting. That hurt. We 
didn't do anything different to become successful or afterwards. We 
were always ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Only Lonely'' is the second single from ``Musical Chairs.''  
The song is also a single release from the movie soundtrack CD, 
``Message in a Bottle.'' Lead singer Darius Rucker wrote the lyrics 
based on the story for the film, ``You've Got Mail.'' But director 
Nora Ephron didn't want the song. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlantic Records pushed for the song in ``Message in a Bottle.''  
</P>
<P>
	The new CD also includes ``Desert Mountain Showdown,'' which  
Bryan wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's some of the most fun music I've ever written,'' he said.  
``You can tell I've been listening to bluegrass. Darius turned me 
on to Doc Watson. Music is my true love in life. I discover things 
like bluegrass. There's so much out there, different styles, new 
instruments to learn, songs I haven't written yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's got Darius playing mandolin. He had never played it. I  
said, 'The chords are not that hard, if you can play guitar. You 
learn where to put your fingers.' He was fine. He had a smile on 
his face when he played it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hootie toured for three weeks in New Zealand, Australia and  
Japan prior to its current U.S. tour. After the tour ends July 3, 
there will likely be a tour in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. tour includes some big festivals.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a blast,'' Bryan said.  
</P>
<P>
	Bryan and bassist Dean Felber grew up in Maryland. The band,  
which also includes drummer Jim ``Soni'' Sonefeld, got together at 
the University of South Carolina in 1985. The name is a compound of 
nicknames from two of Rucker's friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were a cover band the first three years, playing parties  
and clubs and having a good time. When we graduated, we decided to 
see what would happen,'' Bryan said. ``If we sold records, great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If anyone had predicted their first album would sell 200,000  
copies (never mind 15 million), ``We wouldn't have been able to 
believe it,'' Bryan said. ``'Wow, that's a lot of records,' we'd 
have said. The next thing you know, it sold one million, then two 
million, before you knew it, 15 million. It was quite a run. It was 
out in 1994 and really took off in 1995.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The band worked hard to make a name for itself.  
</P>
<P>
	``Before we put the record out, we toured constantly trying to  
create awareness about the band,'' he said. ``Then we kept touring 
two years, just steadily.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weary from touring, Hootie took a break. Band members decided to  
get back together when the urge arose. ``We wanted that feeling of 
itching to do this again,'' Bryan said. ``Once we had that, we went 
and did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That time came in October 1997. They traveled to Jackson Hole,  
Wyo., where they played golf during the day, came up with songs at 
night, and made fun of each other like old friends do. In December, 
they worked on 20 song ideas. After Christmas, they finished the 
songs for ``Musical Chairs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They decided to ``make sure we are happy doing what we do best:  
making music we want to make and enjoying it,'' Bryan said. ``It 
would be nice to sell 15 million again. But we're in a good 
position. We're going to be able to tour the world for a long time 
to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Hootie isn't getting much radio play.  
</P>
<P>
	``Radio played us too much three years ago. We hated how much we  
were overexposed. The ball gets rolling, you can't stop it,'' he 
said. ``Now they're not willing to play us. It's a problem, not 
letting the public get into your song and having it become a hit. 
We're still trying.''

<HEADLINE>  Everglades Blaze Being Contained </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IN THE FLORIDA EVERGLADES (AP) -- Levees, canals and a four-lane  
highway helped firefighters block flames from advancing farther 
through a sea of dry sawgrass. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're winding down on this one, we hope,'' said John Fish, a  
spokesman for the state Division of Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
	By Tuesday night the fire had consumed 160,000 acres. If  
firefighters keep it contained, the blaze should burn out after 
blackening an additional 10,000 acres, Fish said. 
</P>
<P>
	Early today, heavy smoke and low visibility prompted authorities  
to again close Interstate 75, the main east-west highway through 
the Everglades known as Alligator Alley. 
</P>
<P>
	John Cataldo, a spokesman for the Florida Highway Patrol, said  
the highway was closed as a temporary precaution. He added that the 
fire was still contained. 
</P>
<P>
	The flames, burning in a section of the Everglades' roughly 2  
million acres that is outside Everglades National Park, sent up 
columns of smoke visible from miles away Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Flames licked just past the edge of the mostly undeveloped  
Miccosukee Indian Reservation, located in the Everglades about 60 
miles west of Fort Lauderdale. A crew of about 20 Navajo 
firefighters from Window Rock, Ariz., helped quell flare-ups along 
the fire's western edge. 
</P>
<P>
	A new blaze just east of the fire's containment area burned  
seven acres before it was brought under control, and forestry 
officials blamed arson after a dark green Ford Explorer was spotted 
in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	The primary fire began in the eastern Everglades late last week  
and may have been ignited by heat from a vehicle's catalytic 
converter. The cause was still being investigated, Fish said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aided by swirling winds, the blaze quickly became the largest of  
at least 2,542 fires that have burned more than 230,000 acres in 
Florida this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in the state, two fires were burning in the  
Apalachicola National Forest in Wakulla County, said Liz Compton, a 
spokeswoman for the state Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither was threatening any homes or property, although one of  
the blazes advanced to within 20 miles of Tallahassee, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	With rainfall far below normal during Florida's  
December-through-April dry season, officials fear a repeat of last 
summer, when fires scorched nearly 500,000 acres and forced 100,000 
people from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Everglades, wildfires are part of a natural cycle that  
regularly burns away accumulated dry brush. Charred debris left 
behind by the flames will serve as a fertilizer, spurring new plant 
growth, said Tom Fontaine, an ecologist with the South Florida 
Water Management District. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ecosystem's going to be fine,'' he said. ``It will come  
back very much like it was before.''

<HEADLINE> Harper's Bazaar Fashion Editor Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Fashion editor Liz Tilberis, who used her public  
platform at Harper's Bazaar to raise awareness of ovarian cancer, 
died of the disease Wednesday at 51. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Tilberis, who was editor in chief of Harper's Bazaar and,  
before that, editor in chief of British Vogue, was diagnosed with 
cancer in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	She helped raise money for a cure as president of the Ovarian  
Cancer Research Fund and described her battle with the disease last 
year in a memoir, ``No Time to Die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously Liz was a formidable competitor,'' said Anna  
Wintour, editor of Vogue. ``She was a strong, determined person who 
adored fashion and relished the whole world of fashion. I think 
that determination was shown in the way she tried to fight and 
overcome her illness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Shirehampton, England, Ms. Tilberis came on board as  
editor in chief at Harper's Bazaar in 1992, the year the Hearst 
Magazines publication marked its 125th anniversary. She introduced 
more art features and high-quality fashion journalism. She brought 
on board internationally renowned fashion photographers Patrick 
DeMarchelier and Peter Lindbergh. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathleen P. Black, president of Hearst Magazines, said Ms.  
Tilberis ``will be remembered as one of the magazine industry's 
greatest 20th century talents. And for those of us who were lucky 
enough to work with her, her passion and love for life were 
inspirational.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In her memoir, Ms. Tilberis said her recovery from a low point  
during cancer treatment was partly due to the healing influence of 
her close friend Princess Diana. 
</P>
<P>
	``After a particularly drastic bout of chemotherapy, my blood  
cell count simply refused to rise and doctors would not discharge 
me from the isolation unit,'' Ms. Tilberis wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``One morning Diana had called for a chat and when the count was  
taken later that afternoon, it has risen dramatically. I believe 
the princess was single-handedly responsible for getting me home to 
family -- no one will ever convince me otherwise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Tilberis began her career as fashion editor in 1974 at  
British Vogue, where she placed Diana on the cover in 1990. And as 
editor in chief at Harper's, Tilberis featured Diana twice on the 
cover, in 1995 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	At British Vogue, Ms. Tilberis rose quickly, becoming executive  
fashion editor, editor in chief and finally director of Conde Nast 
Publications in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include her husband, Andrew Tilberis, and two sons.

<HEADLINE> Exec: IOC Won't Report Monthly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- IOC board member Kevan Gosper rejected  
a U.S. senator's call for monthly updates on reform prompted by the 
Olympics bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain told IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch in a  
letter this week that Congress and the public still had 
``significant skepticism'' that the International Olympic Committee 
would enact ``comprehensive and meaningful reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain asked that monthly updates be provided to the Senate  
Commerce Committee, which examined the Salt Lake City Olympic 
bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gosper said the IOC board would consider it inappropriate to  
provide any government with monthly reports on reform. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we have any responsibility to report to the  
Senate committee on an ongoing basis,'' Gosper told a Foreign 
Correspondents Association luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know any international corporations doing (it). I  
don't know any U.S. corporations doing it, and don't know why we 
should be asked to do it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten IOC members have resigned or have been expelled in the  
scandal, which involved a million-dollar scheme to buy votes in 
Salt Lake's successful quest for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper said the IOC's response, including the creation of an IOC  
ethics commission, of which he is a member, demonstrated that it is 
serious about reform. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain told Samaranch he was dismayed that the IOC had failed to  
embrace the recommendations of a special ethics panel headed by 
former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell. The senator also 
said he was concerned that the IOC was dragging its feet on 
restructuring and other internal changes, and that Samaranch was 
ultimately in charge of making those reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper said IOC members had strongly endorsed Samaranch to  
remain and take responsibility for the crisis and oversee reform. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the ship gets into trouble, you don't rush up to the  
captain's cabin and throw him overboard,'' Gosper said. ``In fact, 
you rush up to make sure he doesn't jump overboard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said: ``It is a simple oversight to say that because a  
high proportion of the corporations that sponsor and work as 
partners are from the United States, then all the money comes from 
the United States and the United States must have a key say in all 
events,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics committee, which has a majority of members from  
outside the IOC, will meet for the first time on May 3. A one-day 
meeting of the IOC board will follow the day after. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper said an ongoing investigation into Australian IOC member  
Phil Coles would likely be handed to the ethics commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, who was reprimanded after the Salt Lake investigation,  
has since been accused of accepting some $6,300 worth of jewelry 
from someone associated with Athens' failed bid for the 1996 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper said if the board had completed its investigation of  
Coles by the time of the first ethics commission meeting, it would 
turn over the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this stage we haven't come up with a decision, and my  
judgment is that probably the Phil Coles file will go to the ethics 
commission,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Everglades Blaze Being Contained </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IN THE FLORIDA EVERGLADES (AP) -- Levees, canals and a four-lane  
highway helped firefighters block flames from advancing farther 
through a sea of dry sawgrass. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're winding down on this one, we hope,'' said John Fish, a  
spokesman for the state Division of Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
	By Tuesday night the fire had consumed 160,000 acres. If  
firefighters keep it contained, the blaze should burn out after 
blackening an additional 10,000 acres, Fish said. 
</P>
<P>
	Early today, heavy smoke and low visibility prompted authorities  
to again close Interstate 75, the main east-west highway through 
the Everglades known as Alligator Alley. 
</P>
<P>
	John Cataldo, a spokesman for the Florida Highway Patrol, said  
the highway was closed as a temporary precaution. He added that the 
fire was still contained. 
</P>
<P>
	The flames, burning in a section of the Everglades' roughly 2  
million acres that is outside Everglades National Park, sent up 
columns of smoke visible from miles away Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Flames licked just past the edge of the mostly undeveloped  
Miccosukee Indian Reservation, located in the Everglades about 60 
miles west of Fort Lauderdale. A crew of about 20 Navajo 
firefighters from Window Rock, Ariz., helped quell flare-ups along 
the fire's western edge. 
</P>
<P>
	A new blaze just east of the fire's containment area burned  
seven acres before it was brought under control, and forestry 
officials blamed arson after a dark green Ford Explorer was spotted 
in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	The primary fire began in the eastern Everglades late last week  
and may have been ignited by heat from a vehicle's catalytic 
converter. The cause was still being investigated, Fish said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aided by swirling winds, the blaze quickly became the largest of  
at least 2,542 fires that have burned more than 230,000 acres in 
Florida this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in the state, two fires were burning in the  
Apalachicola National Forest in Wakulla County, said Liz Compton, a 
spokeswoman for the state Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither was threatening any homes or property, although one of  
the blazes advanced to within 20 miles of Tallahassee, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	With rainfall far below normal during Florida's  
December-through-April dry season, officials fear a repeat of last 
summer, when fires scorched nearly 500,000 acres and forced 100,000 
people from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Everglades, wildfires are part of a natural cycle that  
regularly burns away accumulated dry brush. Charred debris left 
behind by the flames will serve as a fertilizer, spurring new plant 
growth, said Tom Fontaine, an ecologist with the South Florida 
Water Management District. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ecosystem's going to be fine,'' he said. ``It will come  
back very much like it was before.''

<HEADLINE> How To Explain the School Shooting? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	When Ronda Floyd's daughters asked her about Tuesday's massacre  
at a Colorado high school, she told them that some children grow up 
without a loving home environment. Then she told them that ``some 
kids are just mean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a half-dozen such attacks in 18 months, parents still  
aren't sure what the answer is. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are lots of answers you could give, so you just give  
them general ones,'' said the Indianapolis secretary, whose 
daughters are 15 and 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar discussions have been going on at dinner tables and in  
carpools around the country since the shootings at Columbine High 
School in Littleton, Colo. Again, parents are faced with the same 
unanswerable questions about murder, hopelessness and whether there 
is such a thing as a safe place. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's one of the problems, is that there is never an answer  
given for why. You can't find an answer and I think that would help 
the kids a lot and me a lot -- to say, this is why this occurred,'' 
said Tricia Johnson, who talked about the shooting with her five 
children over breakfast Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Johnson, who lives in rural Davidsonville, Md., outside  
Annapolis, said she and her friends agree that the best way to 
handle the topic with young children is to wait for them to bring 
it up, and then answer straightforwardly. That's what she tried to 
do when her 8-year-old daughter asked what was going on on the 
news. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told her that I didn't know why, I didn't know what was  
wrong with these people that did it ... but that your school is 
safe and you're safe and our town is safe,'' she said. ``I tried to 
make it sound like an aberration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's a lot 8-year-old Casey Clark doesn't understand about  
Tuesday's massacre. Why were those guys wearing coats in the 
spring? Is that person on the ground dead? And Mom, why are you 
crying? 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `But Mom, we're not even related to them,'' said  
Julie Clark, 42, a Des Moines nurse who has two sons. ``And I said 
`Casey, they're children, they're just kids. They had their whole 
world ahead of them.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Torn between whether to ``keep my kids in a cocoon or make them  
street smart,'' Ms. Clark decided it was important to talk through 
what was on the news about the deadly rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `What would you do if someone came in your class with  
a gun?' He said, `I don't know Mom, I never thought about it. What 
would you do?' I said, `I'd be on the floor -- boom. Because more 
than likely, they'll go after the people they see first,''' Ms. 
Clark said, her voice breaking at the memory of the conversation. 
``It's very odd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Child development experts were pessimistic Wednesday, saying  
they believe most parents still don't listen closely to their 
children or prompt productive conversations about violence and teen 
problems, despite the recent string of school shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Children are often talking about things like video games or  
something that happened at school that doesn't appear to be that 
interesting, and parents get distracted and don't listen closely, 
said Mary Margaret Kerr, a professor of psychiatry and education at 
the University of Pittsburgh who consults with school districts on 
violence and trauma. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to say it's in those moments when parents need to  
really intensively listen -- it may just be the lead-in to what the 
child has on their mind or in their heart,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Miller, a work and family expert at Pace University in New  
York, agreed adults are probably not talking openly enough with 
their children, particularly about issues of tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
	``It bothers me that over and over again everyone says they're  
going to have these damn discussions and no one does anything about 
it,'' he said. ``Open them up and say, `How are you feeling about 
this?'''

<HEADLINE> Five Boys Charged With Raping Woman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Five boys, ages 12 to 16, have been  
charged with raping a mentally retarded 21-year-old neighbor while 
the youngsters' relatives were away at church. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman, described by police as having psychological problems  
and the mind of a 10- to 15-year-old, told police she went to visit 
her neighbor Luellen Turner on Friday night and was raped by four 
boys as a friend watched. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Turner is the grandmother and great-grandmother of the four  
boys. She said they are innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why she said it I don't know. Those boys didn't do anything,''  
Ms. Turner said Wednesday, 
</P>
<P>
	All five boys were held at a detention center on charges of  
sexual assault.

<HEADLINE> Rockies, Nuggets Mourn School Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Colorado Avalanche and the San Jose Sharks  
today postponed their first-round NHL playoff series after a deadly 
shooting at a suburban high school. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams were scheduled to open the Stanley Cup playoffs  
tonight and Thursday at McNichols Arena, but Games 1 and 2 will be 
played Saturday and Monday in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
	The series is scheduled to return to Denver for Games 3 and 4 on  
April 28 and April 30. If necessary, the series would stay in 
Colorado for Game 5 on May 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing more important than respect to our  
community,'' Avalanche general manager Pierre Lacroix said. ``It's 
the least we could do for the community to show them the respect 
that they deserve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado Rockies also called off a game for the second  
straight day because of the killings at Columbine High School in 
Littleton. 
</P>
<P>
	Rockies officials said today the team's players and coaches will  
wear a Columbine High School patch on their right sleeves for the 
rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are deeply saddened by the events in Littleton yesterday  
and now is not the time to play baseball,'' Rockies vice chairman 
Charlie Monfort said. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the second consecutive postponement in the three-game  
series between the Rockies and Montreal. The teams will play two 
split doubleheaders when the Expos return in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Both split doubleheaders will be played in what had been a  
three-games series Aug. 13-15, but the exact date of either was not 
set. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies open a four-game series in San Francisco on  
Thursday. Montreal has a day off Thursday and worked out at Coors 
Field today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't have played,'' Expos third baseman Shane Andrews  
said Tuesday. ``I had a hard time just being on the field. Thinking 
about it makes me sick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 15 people were killed at the suburban high school,  
and on Tuesday night the Denver Nuggets postponed their NBA game 
with Portland at McNichols Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where can your kids be safe? On the streets?'' Nuggets forward  
Eric Williams said. ``I feel for those families. You send your kids 
away to school this morning on a peaceful note and come home to 
something tragic like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Nuggets general manager Dan Issel: ``I guess the scary  
thing is it could happen anywhere, it could happen anywhere at any 
time. We don't know how our world got to this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Issel promised that the Nuggets and Avalanche Community Fund  
``will do something financially for those victims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1997, 12 students have been killed in shootings at schools  
in Mississippi, Kentucky, Arkansas and Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can happen to anyone,'' said Colorado pitcher Brian  
Bohanon, who has five children. ``The way things are going 
nowadays, it's popping up all over the country. It's a tragedy. 
They're just kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You start thinking about life,'' Rockies first baseman Todd  
Helton said. ``Players in here are sort of in our own little world, 
and this sort of opens your eyes a little bit to how important life 
is and how important kids are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montreal manager Felipe Alou, who managed the Triple-A Denver  
Bears in 1981, has had sobering reminders. He was with the Expos 
when umpire John McSherry collapsed and died of a heart attack in 
the first inning of Montreal's 1996 season opener in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how many people care if we are playing,'' Alou  
said Tuesday. ``I remember that day in Cincinnati. The whole team 
died with one man dying. ... We can't play. We can't even play 
cards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In April 1992, the Expos were told to wait in San Diego because  
of rioting in Los Angeles. Their three-game series with the Dodgers 
was postponed because Los Angeles was considered too dangerous.

<HEADLINE> Diaries of Famous Atheist Auctioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- The diaries and personal papers of missing  
and perhaps murdered atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair sold at auction 
for $12,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the diaries will provide a real insight into the real  
Madalyn Murray O'Hair,'' said the buyer, Jimmy Nassour, a 
43-year-old Austin lawyer. ``You have someone who probably did 
incredible things for the First Amendment, yet was deemed the most 
hated woman in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Proceeds from Tuesday's auction will go toward claims against  
the O'Hair estate. 
</P>
<P>
	Nassour said the recently reported suspicions that Mrs. O'Hair  
was murdered along with her son and granddaughter for $500,000 in 
gold coins increased the price he was willing to pay. The three 
vanished in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just become more and more interesting with the recent  
developments,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The diaries date from 1953 -- six years before Mrs. O'Hair filed  
her lawsuit that helped lead to a 1963 U.S. Supreme Court ban on 
organized prayer in public schools -- to just weeks before she 
disappeared.

<HEADLINE> Congress Split on Kosovo Financing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Republicans are divided over how  
much money to provide for the conflict with Yugoslavia and an 
accompanying military buildup, but agree it will exceed the $6.05 
billion President Clinton wants and that it will come from Social 
Security surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to move closer to a price tag, lawmakers invited Defense  
Secretary William Cohen and Gen. Hugh Shelton, chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, to testify today to the House Appropriations 
defense subcommittee. In the past, Republicans have said they 
believed Pentagon requests for extra money have been watered down 
by Clinton administration budget officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress was considering the Yugoslav campaign's expense even as  
the city prepared to host NATO leaders for a long-planned 
celebration of the alliance's 50th birthday that has evolved into a 
war council. In a three-day summit beginning Friday, leaders of 40 
nations plan a show of unity over the fighting and may discuss 
clamping on oil embargo on Yugoslavia in hopes of hastening a 
surrender by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore said the United States ``will not stand  
by as Milosevic inflames and exploits the deepest hatred in the 
human heart, kills thousands and displaces millions just to keep 
his place of power. 
</P>
<P>
	In remarks prepared for a ceremony at Ellis Island in New York,  
the U.S. gateway for millions of immigrants, Gore said: 
``Ultimately, the American ideals highlighted by Ellis Island hold 
the key to peace, tolerance and diversity throughout the world. We 
are determined to see a free and peaceful Kosovo, and one day see 
democracy throughout the Balkans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As they prepared to draft legislation financing the U.S. share  
of the fighting over Kosovo and aid to refugees, House GOP leaders 
said they would include money for the Pentagon to buy weapons and 
ammunition and to try to remedy a personnel shortage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see a national security crisis,'' said House Majority Leader  
Dick Armey, R-Texas. ``I see it as our first moral obligation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armey refused to use a figure, but said Monday that a $10  
billion measure would be ``insufficient.'' He blamed Clinton for 
the problem, saying Republicans must ``fill the void that's been 
left by this administration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some House conservatives have said the bill should cost $15  
billion to $18 billion. And Tuesday, Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., 
chairman of the House Armed Services military procurement 
subcommittee, said he believed the bill should run ``well beyond 
$20 billion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said a $15  
billion measure would lack ``any realistic chance'' of being 
approved, and said he preferred something under $10 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a limit to how much you can sensibly spend in a period  
of time,'' Lott told reporters. ``You run the risk if you make it 
too big it collapses in a puddle, and that creates problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the cost, Lott and Armey said they think the money will  
come from this year's projected $110 billion federal surplus, all 
of which is from the Social Security trust fund. That is a 
sensitive admission for Republicans because they have vowed to use 
Social Security surpluses only to overhaul the program or reduce 
the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president has asked for that money, and the American  
people need to understand that it's coming out of Social 
Security,'' Lott told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Armey said if voters see the war's costs trimming the national  
debt reduction that is achieved this year, ``I think they 
understand the need, the priorities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armey said he wants defense needs also to be addressed in bills  
for fiscal 2000, which starts Oct. 1. To pay for it, he said there 
would be a debate over whether money should be shifted from 
domestic to defense spending, and ``whether the tax reduction might 
be less than it might otherwise need to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The comments underlined the GOP dilemma of apportioning money  
among three of its top budgetary priorities: cutting taxes, 
protecting Social Security surpluses and helping the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	In other Kosovo-related developments Tuesday:  
</P>
<P>
	--Seven senators led by presidential contender Sen. John McCain,  
R-Ariz., called for giving Clinton authority to use ``all necessary 
force'' in the Yugoslav conflict, which could open the way to 
ground forces. But Lott said such a vote would be ``not wise.'' 
Passage might give Clinton more leeway to prosecute the fighting 
than Republicans intended, and defeat might send Yugoslavia a 
message that American leaders were divided over the effort, Lott 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Cohen said 11 additional Apache helicopter crews were being  
dispatched from the 18th Airborne Corps at Fort Bragg, N.C. That 
would bring the total Apache-related force assembling in Albania to 
about 3,300 soldiers, or several hundred more than envisioned just 
days ago. 
</P>
<P>
	--Air Force Maj. Gen. Bruce Carlson said the shoot-down of a U.S.  
stealth fighter would only minimally help other countries acquire 
its radar-evading abilities because its technology is 20 years old.

<HEADLINE> Feds Approve Capstar Radio Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department agreed to allow Capstar  
Broadcasting Corp. complete its purchase of Triathlon Broadcasting 
Co. for $190 million after Capstar agreed to sell five Wichita, 
Kan., radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the divestiture, Capstar, based in Austin, Texas, would  
have controlled more than 45 percent of the Wichita radio 
advertising market, which the government contended would have led 
to higher prices for radio ads there. 
</P>
<P>
	On March 5, the department's antitrust division approved the  
same Capstar-Triathlon deal on condition that the same five Wichita 
stations were sold to Connoisseur Communications Partners, but 
Capstar and Connoisseur later dropped that deal. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, Capstar agreed to sell KEYN-FM, KWSJ-FM, KNSS-AM,  
KFH-AM and KQAM-AM to a buyer that must be approved by the Justice 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Capstar owns 309 stations in 76 markets. Triathlon, based in San  
Diego, owns 31 stations in six markets.

<HEADLINE> Industry Pushes Replenished Fish Tag </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's a marriage aimed at putting fish on the  
table of the world's rich and poor for generations to come. 
</P>
<P>
	With research showing that global fish stocks are vanishing,  
business and industry are joining forces with environmental groups 
to back a new seal of approval -- for fish caught from waters where 
they will be replenished. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in the business of saving fish so we can eat them,''  
said British lawmaker John Gummer, chairman of the Marine 
Stewardship Council, an international nonprofit organization which 
unveiled the seal and announced the first independent global 
standard to certify fisheries on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, about  
60 percent of the world's 200 most valuable fish species are either 
depleted, overfished or only slowly recovering. 
</P>
<P>
	Some species, such as the Atlantic halibut and the bluefin tuna,  
have been fished to the brink of extinction. The spawning of 
bluefin tuna in the western Atlantic has fallen by nearly 90 
percent since 1975, the council said. 
</P>
<P>
	A large quality bluefin can fetch as much as $30,000 dockside,  
it added. At the Tsukigi fish market in Japan, the bluefin can go 
for the $60,000 and cost $200 a plate at the sushi bar. 
</P>
<P>
	The aim of the council's campaign, which already has backing  
from more than 200 corporate, government and voluntary 
organizations around the world, is to get ``market power behind the 
battle to save our fishing stocks,'' Gummer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The council hopes the seal -- a line drawing of a fish whose back  
and tail fin are shaped like an approving check mark -- will bolster 
consumer demand for fish that are being replenished, Gummer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The turquoise-and-white logo will begin to appear later this  
year in Europe and North America on fish products, restaurant 
menus, and advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
	Gummer announced the first American companies to sign on --  
Boston-based Legal Sea Foods, a seafood processor and restaurant 
company, and Shaw's Supermarkets which has 127 stores in the six 
New England States. Whole Foods Market Inc., based in Austin, 
Texas, which has 92 stores around the country selling gourmet and 
organic food, also signed. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the fish supply is no longer sustainable, then Legal Sea  
Foods as a business is no longer sustainable,'' said Roger 
Berkowitz, the company's president and chief executive officer. 
``We can't suddenly switch gears and sell poultry or meat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The London-based council was the brainchild of Unilever, one of  
the world's largest buyers of frozen fish, and the World Wide Fund 
for Nature, who wanted to bring together public and private-sector 
efforts to reverse the crisis from overfishing and pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the council was established in 1997, he said, it has  
consulted fishermen and experts around the world to come up with a 
global standard for fisheries that will augment existing local, 
national and international laws, standards and agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	To receive council certification, fisheries must be  
well-managed, maintain and replenish healthy fish stocks, and 
preserve the surrounding ecosystem. 
</P>
<P>
	The council will accredit specialist organizations or commercial  
companies to independently certify that fisheries meet their 
standards -- and ensure that they continue to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be certifying quality fish caught in a way which  
doesn't endanger future fishing,'' Gummer said.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Gunman May Have Had Web Page </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The FBI intends to serve search warrants on  
America Online to gather information on Web sites and member 
profiles relating to the shooting at Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the suspected gunmen, Eric Harris, is believed to have  
had a Web site filled with apocalyptic imagery, apparent bomb 
diagrams and song lyrics such as ``WHAT I DON'T LIKE I WASTE.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denver Division spokesman for the bureau, Gary Gomez, said the  
FBI would present the warrants as early as today. 
</P>
<P>
	Using the America Online screen name ``rebdomine'' -- possibly a  
word play on the school mascot, the Rebel -- Harris apparently 
titled his Web page ``REB's words of wisdom, if you don't like it, 
ill kill you'' and packed it with drawings of devils, guns and 
pyres of skulls. 
</P>
<P>
	The site featured verses like: ``WHAT I DON'T SAY I DON'T DO.''  
``WHAT I DON'T DO I DON'T LIKE.'' ``WHAT I DON'T LIKE I WASTE.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those lyrics and others quoted on the Web page are from various  
songs by the German industrial rock band KMFDM. On its Web site, 
the band expressed sympathy for the victims of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are sick and appalled, as is the rest of the nation, by  
what took place in Colorado yesterday,'' said Sascha K., founder of 
KMFDM. 
</P>
<P>
	At the bottom of the AOL page, Harris listed his favorite chat  
room: ``ich bin ein auslander,'' pidgin German for ``I am an 
outsider.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AOL spokeswoman Kim McCreery said she couldn't comment on  
whether this was, in fact, Harris' account. Any content considered 
relevant to the school shooting was taken down and preserved for 
the FBI, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our policy in a criminal investigation is to comply with a  
subpoena or search warrant as quickly as we can get the information 
together,'' McCreery said. ``We'll cooperate with authorities and 
do what we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris also apparently had a member profile on AOL, a  
self-written description of an account holder's interests. Profiles 
thought to belong to the other gunman, Dylan Klebold, also were 
apparently taken down. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point we have no clear evidence that the people who  
were directly involved posted any kind of warnings,'' McCreery said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris' alleged page was copied and posted at another Web site  
before it was taken down. 
</P>
<P>
	While there is no way to absolutely prove these are Web pages  
created by Harris, there are indications they are real. 
</P>
<P>
	The page included a Microsoft Word document with instructions on  
making pipebombs. Microsoft Word automatically inserts the author's 
name in the code of the document, which often can be read when the 
document is converted to plain text. 
</P>
<P>
	The name listed was Wayne N. Harris, who is the father of Eric  
Harris, according to the Denver Post. 
</P>
<P>
	The copied page could also traced back to a site called ``The  
Floating Pancreas,'' another site filled with death imagery. The 
Floating Pancreas listed a profile of a member going by the name 
``NiggerRip'' and listing his e-mail as rebdomine@aol.com and 
included a Web page pointing back to rebdomine's original AOL 
address. 
</P>
<P>
	The profile was created in February 1998.  
</P>
<P>
	Another AOL spokeswoman, Tricia Primrose, noted that hoaxes are  
common after big news events. It is relatively easy to perpetrate 
an Internet hoax because of free e-mail services and trial accounts 
on providers like AOL.

<HEADLINE> American, US Airways Earnings Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMR Corp., the parent company of American Airlines, saw its  
earnings fall by 45 percent in the first quarter, hurt by a pilots' 
sickout that paralyzed the carrier in February. 
</P>
<P>
	US Airways Group Inc.'s earnings fell by 63 percent in the first  
quarter, battered by bad weather and a switch to a new computer 
system that led to flight cancellations and delays. 
</P>
<P>
	Trans World Airlines narrowed its loss in the quarter, boosted  
by an increase in passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet all three reports Wednesday beat Wall Street's expectations  
and their shares rose. 

</P>
<P>
                             *AMR Corp.    	
</P>
<P>
	The parent company of American Airlines earned $158 million  
profit, or 96 cents a share, in the period ended March 31, compared 
with $290 million, or $1.62 a share, during the same period last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues in the quarter were $4.48 billion, down from $4.63  
billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fort Worth, Texas-based airline's results were hurt by a  
pilots' sickout in February that led to the cancellation of more 
than 6,700 flights. The 10-day job action stranded hundreds of 
thousands of passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are obviously disappointed that the illegal job action  
undertaken by the Allied Pilots Association leadership so 
dramatically impacted our first-quarter financial results,'' said 
Donald Carty, chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Pretax revenue losses from the job action totaled about $225  
million, American spokesman Tim Kincaid said Wednesday. A federal 
judge last week ordered the APA and its two top union officers to 
pay AMR $45 million in damages. The union has said it plans to 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the dispute with pilots, the airline posted a profit.  
First-quarter earnings were strengthened by AMR's sale of three 
nonairline subsidiaries, AMR Services, AMR Combs and TeleService 
Resources. 
</P>
<P>
	The sales resulted in an after-tax gain of $64 million. AMR also  
sold a portion of its Equant holdings, which resulted in an 
after-tax and minority-interest gain of $37 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding those gains, AMR earned $56 million, or 34 cents a  
share, in the first quarter. Analysts had pegged the results at 33 
cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR also announced it plans to acquire more than 115 new  
aircraft during the next three years and has accelerated plans to 
retire its DC-10 fleet and 16 Boeing 727s. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR shares climbed $2, or by 2.9 percent, to close at $69.81 1/4 on  
the New York Stock Exchange. 

</P>
<P>
                        *US Airways Group Inc.    	
</P>
<P>
	The Arlington, Va.-based airline earned $36 million, or 49 cents  
a share, in the first quarter, compared with $98 million, or 96 
cents a share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the quarter were $2.1 billion, about 0.4 percent  
higher than a year ago, while expenses were $2 billion, up by 6 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite its 63 percent drop in earnings, US Airways beat Wall  
Street's expectations of 45 cents a share. US Airways' stock was up 
$2.68 3/4, or by 5.1 percent, to $55.56 1/4 a share on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the problems during the quarter were bad weather and a  
switch to a new computer system led to flight cancellations and 
delays. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said operations were much closer to normal by the  
end of March, as the weather improved and the impact of the 
transition to the new computer system lessened. The number of 
cancellations declined and on-time performance began returning to 
more normal levels. 

</P>
<P>
                        *Trans World Airlines    	
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis-based airline reported a loss of $21.5 million, or  
42 cents a share, for the quarter ended March 31, compared with a 
loss of $54 million, or $1.06 a share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues in the quarter were $764 million, down slightly from  
$765 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	TWA said the first quarter was its best ever for both passenger  
boardings and load factor, or the percentage of seats filled. The 
carrier said it was the No. 1 on-time airline in February with an 
83.2 percent on-time rate, which improved to 84.5 percent in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating expenses for the quarter decreased to $802.2 million  
from $834.1 million for the same period a year ago. But there was 
an increase in aircraft rentals associated with the company's fleet 
renewal program. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, TWA is receiving 37 previously ordered new Boeing  
aircraft that will replace older 727 and DC-9 aircraft. By the end 
of the year, the company will have replaced 42 percent of the fleet 
since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	TWA also has signed an agreement to lease three Boeing 767-300ER  
aircraft from GE Capital Aircraft Services, to be delivered this 
year and in 2000. As part of the transactions, TWA has sold and 
will lease back from GE Capital five 767 aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	TWA shares rose 12 1/2 cents, or by 2.3 percent, to close at $5.62 1/2  
on the American Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> CIA: China Stole US Weapons Secrets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Through aggressive spying, China obtained  
classified information on a variety of U.S. nuclear weapons, making 
it possible for Beijing to modernize its arsenal in the next few 
years, U.S. intelligence officials told Congress on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a long-awaited damage assessment, administration officials  
disclosed for the first time that China gathered classified 
information not just on the W-88 warhead and the neutron bomb but 
on ``several'' modern U.S. warheads -- particularly ``re-entry 
vehicles,'' the nuclear weapons mounted on multiple-warhead 
rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	``China obtained by espionage classified U.S. nuclear weapons  
information that probably accelerated its program to develop future 
nuclear weapons,'' according to a declassified version of the 
assessment. 
</P>
<P>
	But the intelligence team said China also gained some valuable  
weapons information in open venues such as public conferences and 
scientific exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, who was briefed on the findings Wednesday,  
ordered a review to assess potential vulnerability to espionage 
beyond the U.S. nuclear weapons laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	``Measures to protect sensitive nuclear weapons information must  
be constantly scrutinized,'' Clinton said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese espionage at U.S. weapons labs developed into a  
political storm for Clinton as Republicans accused his 
administration of being lax in responding to the FBI's initial 
concerns in 1995. The issue followed on the heels of allegations 
that the administration promoted commercial satellite exports that 
allowed Beijing to improve its ballistic missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Shelby said the  
briefing Wednesday made it clear that Chinese spying continued into 
the Clinton administration, something that the president in the 
past has denied knowledge of. 
</P>
<P>
	``It confirms my worst fears,'' Shelby, R-Ala., said of the  
damage assessment. ``We made it easy for the Chinese because of 
weak security at our national labs.... We took too long to find out 
what was going on and we still don't know how deep and wide the 
problem is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash., ranking Democrat on the House  
Intelligence Committee, said that while the report ``demonstrates a 
terrible intelligence failure'' by the United States, the long-term 
security implications are less clear. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Chinese still have not yet been able to demonstrate that  
they've taken advantage of it. And only time will tell,'' Dicks 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the assessment team's conclusions was that China has not  
yet deployed any weapons based on stolen U.S. technology but may be 
developing them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese nuclear arsenal, estimated at 18 to 20  
single-warhead ICBMs and perhaps 400 single-warhead short- and 
medium-range nuclear missiles, never has rivaled those of the 
United States and Russia. Nor does Beijing appear to have any plans 
to do so, the assessment said. The United States has about 10,000 
nuclear warheads. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, China is trying to improve the credibility of its  
nuclear threat by improving its retaliatory capability, according 
to the intelligence assessment. Doing so involves developing 
lighter, more mobile and therefore more survivable warheads, such 
as the W-88, a miniaturized warhead mounted on the eight-warhead 
Trident II submarine-launched missile. China has a no-first-use 
nuclear policy, making survivability of its arsenal a key priority. 
</P>
<P>
	China also is seeking to improve the forces it has arrayed  
against potential regional enemies, according to the assessment 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	China emphatically has denied the espionage charges, saying its  
own scientists achieved improvements in nuclear weapons design. 
</P>
<P>
	The multi-agency assessment team led Robert Walpole, the CIA  
official in charge of strategic and nuclear issues, was overseen by 
an outside panel of experts headed by retired Adm. David Jeremiah. 
</P>
<P>
	China is seeking to close ``significant deficiencies'' in its  
nuclear weapons capability, the assessment found, and ``the Chinese 
almost certainly are using aggressive collection efforts to address 
deficiencies.'' China is likely to adopt the U.S. weapons 
information into its own programs over the next few years, 
according to the assessment. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of the loss of secrets, ``future Chinese weapons  
will look more like ours,'' said a senior intelligence official 
familiar with the assessment, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1988 Chinese document, obtained by U.S. intelligence, as well  
as close analysis of Chinese weapons tests, touched off a 1995 
investigation of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. 
A Taiwanese-American formerly employed at Los Alamos is under 
investigation in connection with the W-88 case. 
</P>
<P>
	The declassified assessment did not name the several other U.S.  
nuclear warheads about which China obtained ``at least basic design 
information.'' To identify them, said the senior official, would 
provide clues as to how U.S. intelligence learned about the Chinese 
espionage successes and would let Beijing assess the accuracy of 
its stolen information. 
</P>
<P>
	In assessing damage to U.S. national security, the intelligence  
team concluded that by obtaining more U.S. nuclear technology, 
``the Chinese might be less concerned about sharing their older 
technology'' with other countries, posing a proliferation risk. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jeremiah panel said loss of classified technology may be  
more damaging to the United States now than during the Cold War, 
when substantial weapons research kept the United States ahead of 
competitors.

<HEADLINE> Jackson Wins Sports Emmy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Keith Jackson left the broadcasting industry  
with both arms full, receiving the lifetime achievement and 
outstanding play-by-play awards Wednesday night during the 20th 
Sports Emmy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	``It absolutely means a lot,'' Jackson said. ``It means they  
respected me for what I did. I'll take the trophies home, polish 
them once a year and then put them away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CBS led all networks with nine awards, including seven relating  
to its 1998 Olympic coverage, in the tightest network tally ever. 
However, the network barely edged out its competition -- even in an 
Olympic year. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox and HBO got eight Emmys apiece and NBC grabbed five.  
</P>
<P>
	Cris Collinsworth of Fox and HBO won for outstanding studio  
analyst and Fox's James Brown received an award for studio host. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really didn't expect this,'' the emotional Brown said. ``I  
didn't want to come here because I was up against such great 
competition. I'm just thrilled to be recognized for what small role 
I play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fox's John Madden won for outstanding event analyst, and the  
network also won for outstanding live special for its coverage of 
Mark McGwire's record-breaking 62nd homer last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're presented with a situation of a lifetime and you just  
try not to blow it,'' said Fox's Joe Buck, who made the historic 
call of the game. ``It's the best moment I've ever had by light 
years. Thankfully, it worked out for everyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	HBO's ``Real Sports'' with Bryant Gumbel grabbed three awards  
and the cable network had a strong showing by finishing ahead of 
networks NBC and ABC and cable sports leader ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
	Another surprise came when NBC's golf coverage was honored for  
outstanding live sports series. It beat out ABC's college football, 
ESPN and Fox's baseball coverage and the NBA on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you go back in history, I don't think that golf has ever  
won anything here,'' NBC executive producer Tom Roy said. ``This 
was a huge upset for us, but we deserved it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ESPN received just four awards on the night, including three  
from its ESPN2 coverage. ABC claimed just one award -- from Jackson. 
CNBC and the Outdoor Life Network also had one award. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson joined previous recipients Jim Simpson, Jim McKay,  
Lindsey Nelson, Curt Gowdy, Pat Summerall, Howard Cosell and Vin 
Scully as a lifetime achievement winner. 
</P>
<P>
	The recipients were chosen by a panel of their peers from more  
than 600 entries in 27 categories and areas.

<HEADLINE> Drop in One Solvent Helping Ozone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The level of ozone-depleting chemicals in the atmosphere is  
falling, mostly because of reductions in one solvent, meaning 
further cuts can occur only if emissions of other chemicals are 
lowered, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have made progress, but we're not out of the woods yet,''  
said Stephen A. Montzka of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers monitored levels of the chemicals at remote  
locations worldwide between 1992 and 1997. Levels were found to 
have declined about 3 percent. The findings were published in 
Thursday's issue of the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Production of a solvent called methyl chloroform was phased out  
between 1993 and 1996. Levels of the chemical have dropped almost 
in half since then because of production cuts and the substance's 
five-year lifespan in the atmosphere, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	That decrease accounted for so much of the drop in  
ozone-depleting chemicals that if methyl chloroform were ignored, 
the overall level would have been increasing in 1997, the 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other chemicals such as CFC-12, a refrigerant, and CFC-11, used  
to make foam, are still present at more than twice the peak levels 
of methyl chloroform. Although CFCs are regulated, CFC-12 levels 
actually rose, while CFC-11 declined slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, atmospheric levels of one firefighting chemical,  
H-1211, continued to increase despite the availability of 
alternatives. H-1211 is particularly troubling because it contains 
bromine, a potent ozone destroyer. 
</P>
<P>
	The ozone layer protects the Earth from excessive ultraviolet  
light, which has been linked to skin cancer. Ozone depletion has 
been the most severe over the Antarctic, where an ``ozone hole'' 
appears periodically. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1989, 165 nations signed the Montreal Protocol, an agreement  
to reduce levels of ozone-damaging chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	The quick gains in reducing methyl chloroform, are not expected  
to be repeated with the CFCs. The two chemicals are still allowed 
to be made in developing countries on a limited basis until 2010. 
And once released, they spend a long time in the atmosphere-- 100 
years for CFC-12 and 45 years for CFC-11. In addition, CFC-11 and 
CFC-12 continue to be released from junked air conditioners, foam 
and other products. 
</P>
<P>
	Ozone depletion can be halted in the next decade, Paul J.  
Fraser, of CSIRO Atmospheric Research in Victoria, Australia, and 
Michael J. Prather of the University of California at Irvine wrote 
in an accompanying commentary. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it will require a new level of global stewardship that  
still poses a substantial challenge to all parties to the Montreal 
Protocol,'' they said.

<HEADLINE> Bauer Enters GOP Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWPORT, Ky. (AP) -- Conservative activist Gary Bauer declared  
his presidential candidacy Wednesday, telling students in his 
hometown the school killings in Colorado prove ``something is wrong 
in America'' that only a moral reawakening can fix. 
</P>
<P>
	``This country can be better than it is today, and I intend to  
make it better,'' he told a crowd of 1,000 at Newport High School, 
his alma mater. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer, 52, a long-shot Republican candidate who served in the  
Reagan White House, had planned to introduce his pro-family, 
anti-abortion agenda to the country in a speech setting himself 
apart from the rest of the GOP field. Instead, he devoted most of 
his remarks to the slayings at Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	The rampage leaves Americans wondering ``whether we're going to  
continue to sink into the despair, violence and death that all too 
often fills our television sets,'' said the father of three 
children who left this blue-collar Ohio River town 35 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer said the problem is simple: Too many children resort to  
hatred, not God, in a nation that glorifies violence in its mass 
media, allows ``militant secularism'' in its courtrooms and 
legalizes abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will never sacrifice one American child -- born or unborn,''  
he vowed. 
</P>
<P>
	An opponent of gun control, Bauer said new laws would only  
``focus on things and instruments instead of what happens in the 
hearts of our kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood promotes violence, he said. The justice system forbids  
prayer in schools. And Washington ``gives us platitudes,'' not 
moral leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Draped in flags, the high school gym vibrated to rowdy applause  
and country music. Dozens of students wore Bauer T-shirts handed 
out by the campaign, but few seemed to know much about the 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	His remarks about the Colorado killings touched a nerve, though.  
``God, I hope it doesn't happen here,'' said freshman Anthony 
Barlow, 15. 
</P>
<P>
	After stopping for a bowl of chili, his hometown's specialty,  
Bauer was flying to Iowa to deliver his original speech. Focusing 
on taxes, trade, foreign policy and values, Bauer hopes to prove to 
increasingly pragmatic social conservatives that he could win the 
general election. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to see a candidate that not only communicates their  
issues but also a candidate who can win,'' said Christian Coalition 
executive director Randy Tate. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Gary is given half a chance to get his message across to  
the nation, he will be a formidable candidate,'' said longtime ally 
James Dobson, an influential conservative broadcaster who stopped 
short of endorsing Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Vice President Dan Quayle, political commentator Pat  
Buchanan, radio broadcaster Alan Keyes, New Hampshire Sen. Bob 
Smith, businessman Steve Forbes and Bauer are competing for the 
same base. 
</P>
<P>
	While this is Bauer's first campaign, Quayle won the vice  
presidency in 1988 and Buchanan won the 1996 New Hampshire primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer's strength is his knack for communicating the values of  
grass-roots conservatives. At 5 feet 6 inches, Bauer is a small man 
who promises to look out for the little guy. 
</P>
<P>
	He pledged to replace the tax code with a 16 percent flat tax  
that aides said would include credits of $1,500 per person. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes supports a 17 percent flat tax, with individual  
exemptions, but senior adviser Jeff Bell said Bauer's plan is 
designed to offer more middle- and lower-class relief than the 
Forbes plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer also has denounced trade with China. He said relations  
should be conditioned on that country making progress on human 
rights and democratic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	``It cannot be business as usual when we are aiming consumer  
products at a foreign power and they are aiming nuclear missiles at 
us,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	When Bauer was growing up, this suburb of Cincinnati was rife  
with gambling and prostitution. The son of a janitor, Bauer was a 
young volunteer on a reform campaign that cleaned up the town in 
the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	Excited about his campaign and the future of America, Bauer was  
nonetheless subdued by the Colorado killings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite the Dow Jones Industrial Average over 10,000, a  
growing economy and despite all of the things to our credit, you 
and I know there is something wrong in America,'' Bauer said.

<HEADLINE> Bauer Enters GOP Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWPORT, Ky. (AP) -- Conservative activist Gary Bauer declared  
his candidacy for presidency today by telling students at his 
former high school that the killings in a Colorado school fit a 
pattern of ``despair, violence and death'' that he hopes to reverse 
for America. 
</P>
<P>
	``This country can be better than it is today, I intend to make  
it better,'' Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer decided late Tuesday to shelve huge chunks of his prepared  
text to focus on the shootings in Littleton, Colo., where 15 people 
were killed earlier in the day. He planned to deliver the original 
address with its policy and political points later today in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The text made clear that Bauer is betting that his hardscrabble  
background, tax cuts and morality-bound foreign policies will set 
him apart from the crowded presidential field. ``Virtue is in free 
fall,'' he said in the text, and cannot be reclaimed for America 
without a family-friendly national agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reverence and respect are disappearing, and the question  
before us is: Will the family, as well?'' the Republican said. ``We 
clobber it with taxes; we marginalize it with judicial decrees; we 
undermine it with hostile policies and redefine it with trendy 
ideas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The son of a janitor, Bauer, 52, returned to the blue-collar  
river town across the Ohio from Cincinnati to underscore empathy 
for Americans of all classes and races. ``God's light shines for 
all,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hundred students and local residents nearly filled the  
Newport High School gymnasium, which reverberated with loud cheers 
and country music. Without fireworks and sports stars, Bauer's 
announcement lacked the flash and energy that accompanied former 
Vice President Dan Quayle's opening a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But his emotional, off-the-cuff remarks drew thunderous applause  
several times. 
</P>
<P>
	``You and I know that despite ... a Dow Jones Industrial Average  
over 10,000, a growing economy and despite all of the things to our 
credit, you and I know there is something wrong in America,'' Bauer 
told the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer, who is adamantly opposed to gun control, offered no  
specific legislation or federal actions to counter the rash of 
school shootings, but said the problem has to be addressed at its 
core: declining moral values. He said Hollywood producers should be 
ashamed of what ``you've done to American culture'' and blasted 
what he called a ``militant secularism in America's judicial 
system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got drive-by shootings, babies in trash cans,  
out-of-wedlock births, the American family under fire and the 
American Civil Liberties Union is worried that some children in 
America may be reminded where their civil liberties come from'' if 
the Ten Commandments are displayed in schools, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Little-known outside Washington, the former Reagan White House  
adviser made his name in the nation's capital by running 
conservative political organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	He has a wide fund-raising base and deep roots in the social  
conservative community, but is still considered a long-odds 
candidate for the 2000 GOP nomination. He raised an impressive $1.4 
million in the first quarter of 1999, though the campaign has 
already spent much of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Gary is given half a chance to get his message across to  
the nation, he will be a formidable candidate,'' said longtime ally 
James Dobson, an influential conservative broadcaster who stopped 
short of endorsing Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer must outpace several other candidates competing for the  
same votes and convince increasingly pragmatic social conservatives 
that he could win a general election. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to see a candidate that not only communicates their  
issues, but also a candidate who can win,'' Christian Coalition 
executive director Randy Tate said. As never before, ``they are 
looking at electability this year,'' Tate said. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Vice President Dan Quayle, political commentator Pat  
Buchanan, radio broadcaster Alan Keyes, New Hampshire Sen. Bob 
Smith, millionaire businessman Steve Forbes and Bauer are competing 
for the same base. 
</P>
<P>
	While this is Bauer's first campaign, Quayle won the vice  
presidency in 1988 and Buchanan won the 1996 New Hampshire primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer's strength is his knack for communicating the values of  
grassroots conservatives, particularly on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I stand, without apology, for the right of the voiceless and  
defenseless to take their first breath, and be welcomed into the 
world,'' he said. He pledged to introduce legislation making unborn 
children protected by the 14th Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Quayle, who declared his candidacy a week ago, Bauer made  
values a centerpiece of his announcement speech. ``We can build a 
powerful economy ... yet virtue is in free fall. If nights are 
filled with drive-by shootings and mornings bring new stories of 
babies tossed in the garbage like Styrofoam cups, can America be 
truly richer or poorer?'' Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	He promised to eliminate a tax code that ``poisons the river of  
good will and betrays the American dream.'' He would replace it 
with a 16 percent flat tax that aides said would include tax 
credits of $1,500 per person. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes supports a 17 percent flat tax, with individual  
exemptions. Senior adviser Jeff Bell said Bauer's plan is designed 
to offer more middle- and lower-class relief than the Forbes plan. 
</P>
<P>
	In another departure from establishment Republicans, Bauer  
denounced trade with China. He said relations should be conditioned 
on the country making progress on human rights and democratic 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	``It cannot be business as usual when we are aiming consumer  
products at a foreign power and they are aiming nuclear missiles at 
us,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Majority of Playgrounds Found Unsafe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Poorly executed designs and inadequate supervision  
make the majority of the nation's playgrounds unsafe for children 
to play in, a safety group said. 
</P>
<P>
	The majority of the 1,353 playgrounds visited had inadequate  
surfaces to protect children from falls, the most common playground 
injury, according to the National Program for Playground Safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iowa-based safety group planned to release its findings  
Thursday at the Boston conference of the American Association of 
Leisure and Recreation. 
</P>
<P>
	Guidelines from the Consumer Product Safety Commission call for  
playground surfaces to be coated with wood chips, sand or other 
soft materials, but the study found that in 62 percent of 
playgrounds the materials were not applied in the right areas, and 
were not deep enough in 56 percent of cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guidelines have been in existence since 1981 and many  
playgrounds are still substandard,'' said Mick Mack, the NPPS' 
project coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also found no adults present in 23 percent of the  
playgrounds visited. Also worrisome was a lack of separate areas 
for different age groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The NPPS said reported childhood injuries rose from 93,000 in  
1977 to 200,000 in 1994, but Mack said with equipment generally 
improving, the reason was unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think there are more children playing on playgrounds,''  
Mack said.

<HEADLINE> Celebrity Deathmatch Praised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``Celebrity Deathmatch'' is funny. Violently  
funny. Gruesomely funny. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's not all. It's a breath of fresh air in a world  
suffocating on celebrity. Take a whiff of this: famous people 
fabulously clobbering each other! 
</P>
<P>
	Granted, the mayhem and matchups are all (sigh) make-believe. It  
isn't really Ice Cube who squares off against Ice-T. Or Hillary 
Rodham Clinton punishing Monica Lewinsky. Or Britain's Prince 
Charles vs. the Artist Formerly Known as Prince. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's the next best thing. On ``Deathmatch,'' the celebrities  
are represented by puppet caricatures. Then these clay-and-plastic 
effigies come out swinging on this ultimate-fighting spoof. 
</P>
<P>
	``Celebrity Deathmatch,'' which airs on MTV at 10 p.m. EDT  
Thursday, is produced in a tranquil high-rise in Manhattan's 
theater district. In each of a dozen offices-turned-studios, action 
sequences with the Barbie-size replicas are meticulously animated, 
frame by frame. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseeing this entire pugilistic enterprise is Eric Fogel, who  
created the series. 
</P>
<P>
	``No harm intended,'' said the 29-year-old Fogel who, in T-shirt  
and cords, seemed sufficiently credible professing his ``innocent 
love of cartoon violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was talking about the time-honored toon convention that  
permits Wile E. Coyote to sustain a grievous injury in his pursuit 
of the Road Runner, then fully recover by the next scene. That's 
what inspires Fogel to put Larry King in the ring with Geraldo 
Rivera, who, stretching back Larry's suspender and letting it go, 
lops off Larry's left arm at the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	``No harm intended,'' as Fogel would say. And one-armed Larry  
King fights on. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, from the announcers' booth in the Deathmatch Arena,  
tuxedoed Johnny Gomez and Nick Diamond dispatch their zesty 
analysis. 
</P>
<P>
	Hear Nick introducing the event that pits Madonna against  
Michael Jackson: ``Two pop stars ... one ring ... equals Deathmatch 
carnage the whole family can enjoy!'' 
</P>
<P>
	But when the Gloved One encounters Madonna's flying fists, he  
clearly doesn't have a prayer. ``His innocence may shame our 
corrupt adult world,'' Johnny muses, ``but it's no match for 
kah-rah-taaay!'' 
</P>
<P>
	On another card, watermelon-smashing comic Gallagher swiftly  
finishes off the rock-star Gallagher brothers, Liam and Noel -- by 
smashing both their heads with a sledgehammer. 
</P>
<P>
	And when the female stars of ``Friends'' duke it out, Jennifer  
Aniston beans Courteney Cox with an espresso machine. Then 
Courteney stuffs her knee down Lisa Kudrow's throat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll allow it!'' barks the anything-goes referee, Mills Lane.  
</P>
<P>
	No one gets out of that match alive.  
</P>
<P>
	Along with the appeal of its comic bloodlust, Fogel conceded  
that his show ``does celebrate the absurdity of the glamorous life 
these people live, and of all of us viewing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trouble is, most flesh-and-blood celebrities spend too much time  
savoring that glamour and the public's fixation on fame -- and not 
enough time defending their title. No wonder there's a glut of 
celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Celebrity Deathmatch'' presents the much-needed solution. Let  
real-life celebs, pumped on the steroids of vanity and privilege, 
put their fame on the line in the Deathmatch ring. There, the 
weaker celebrity will fall to the fiercest. What an entertaining 
way for them to thin their ranks! 
</P>
<P>
	(No harm intended by this plan.)  
</P>
<P>
	``My only hope is, they can appreciate the joke and the humor,''  
said Fogel, speaking of the celebrities he parodies. ``And most of 
them do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their approval isn't needed, he said, and they are never  
notified in advance. Their voices are supplied by impersonators. 
Therefore, anyone famous is fair game. 
</P>
<P>
	But where can Fogel go after Jim Carrey vs. Mariah Carey (with  
Drew Carey thrown in)? Or, thanks to the handy ``Deathmatch'' time 
machine, Moses vs. the Pharaoh, with Mills Lane cast as God the 
Almighty Ref? 
</P>
<P>
	Or Kate Moss, Claudia Schiffer and Tyra Banks fashionably  
maiming one another for the Deathmatch Spring Collection? 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing we're starting to explore is physically challenged  
celebrities,'' said Fogel, careful not to slight any sector of 
celebritydom. ``Maybe a wheelchair demolition derby: Chris Reeve 
and Stephen Hawking. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as the violence stays cartoonish and unrealistic ...  
,'' he said, ``I think we're safe to try almost anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But whatever they try, you can count on their celebrities to  
wage a good, clean brawl. Make sure to inhale.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-U.K. Aviation Talks To Resume </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Informal talks aimed at restarting formal  
negotiations over a new aviation agreement between the United 
States and the United Kingdom will begin next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater and British Deputy Prime  
Minister John Prescott reached the agreement during a meeting in 
Washington on Tuesday. It was announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	In a joint statement, Slater and Prescott said they hope ``that  
such talks would lead to formal discussions in June.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations over an ``open skies'' deal between the two allies  
collapsed last fall after only three days of meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the current aviation treaty, known as Bermuda II, only two  
U.S. carriers -- American Airlines and United Airlines -- are allowed 
to fly into London's Heathrow Airport. The airport is especially 
popular with business travelers because it offers the most 
connections to international points. 
</P>
<P>
	Under an open skies deal, an unlimited number of carriers could  
serve any U.S. or British airport. U.S. officials believe that 
added access to Heathrow would drive down airfares and give 
customers more flight selections.

<HEADLINE> SuperSonics' Baker Out with Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Vin Baker's season might be over because of a  
knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle SuperSonics announced before their game with  
Minnesota on Wednesday night that their four-time All-Star forward 
will miss 2-4 weeks because of a deep bone contusion in his right 
knee. 
</P>
<P>
	That means if the Sonics miss the playoffs for the first time  
since the 1989-90 season, Baker won't play in any more games this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker's injury was determined by a magnetic resonance imaging  
test Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sonics, who took a 19-22 record into their game against the  
Timberwolves, end their regular season May 5 at Los Angeles against 
the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker was placed on the injured list March 23 because of a  
partial ligament tear of his right thumb, missing 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
	In 30 games this season, he averaged 13.8 points. He scored a  
season-high 31 points March 1 at Sacramento.

<HEADLINE>  SW Missouri Hires Hinson As Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) -- Barry Hinson, coach at Oral Roberts for  
two years, was hired as basketball coach at Southwest Missouri on 
Wednesday, a job he said he accepted with pride, even knowing it 
was turned down by someone else. 
</P>
<P>
	Hinson, who won a reputation as an aggressive coach and a sharp  
dresser during two seasons at Oral Roberts, displayed both traits 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Striding quickly to the center of the Hammons Student Center  
alumni lounge after a brief introduction, the new coach said he 
breathed a sigh of relief when he saw the podium was a short one. 
It would be just right, he added, for a short basketball coach, 
someone who at 5-feet-8 had feared he would have to stand on a 
phone book to introduce himself as Steve Alford's successor. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Hinson, dressed in a stylish, blue, pinstriped suit,  
launched into a fast-paced, 45-minute explanation of himself, 
bouncing up and down and waving his arms at times as he 
acknowledged that he is ``a little bit hyper.'' He said to expect 
the same kind of team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a very aggressive person. As you can tell,'' he added to  
much laughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Of his team's defensive style: ``We're going to dive for loose  
balls, draw charging fouls.'' In short, play the same way he does 
in pickup games with friends. 
</P>
<P>
	As for offense, he said simply: ``I like to shoot the 3.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Kevin Ault is going to love me,'' he said of the team's senior  
guard, who has a chance to break the school's record for 3-pointers 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hinson's Oral Roberts teams led the Mid-Continent Conference in  
scoring the past two seasons, putting up 77.9 points a game this 
year. They also led the conference in field goal percentage (48.4 
percent) and 3-point percentage (38.2 percent). 
</P>
<P>
	He was 36-23 in two seasons, his team finishing second in the  
conference in 1998 and tying Valparaiso for first this year. He was 
an assistant at Oral Roberts the four previous seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Alford, 78-58 in four seasons at Southwest Missouri, resigned  
last month to become coach at Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The Southwest Missouri job was offered to and accepted by  
Appalachian State's Buzz Peterson, but he backed out the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to talk about guys who came in here and turned  
this job down,'' Hinson snapped. When he interviewed for the 
position on Sunday, he said, ``I slammed my fist on the table and 
said, `I want this job.''' 
</P>
<P>
	He signed a four-year contract paying him $100,000 a season and  
guaranteeing at least $50,000 more for radio and TV work. He'll 
also receive a country club membership, use of a car, use of the 
school's Hammons Student Center for summer basketball camps, and 
various cash incentives for taking the team to a conference 
championship or to the NCAA tournament.

percent) and 3-point percentage (38.2 percent). 
</P>
<P>
	He was 36-23 in two seasons, his team finishing second in the  
conference in 1998 and tying Valparaiso for first this year. He was 
an assistant at Oral Roberts the four previous seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Alford, 78-58 in four seasons at Southwest Missouri, resigned  
last month to become coach at Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The Southwest Missouri job was offered to and accepted by  
Appalachian State's Buzz Peterson, but he backed out the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to talk about guys who came in here and turned  
this job down,'' Hinson snapped. When he interviewed for the 
position on Sunday, he said, ``I slammed my fist on the table and 
said, `I want this job.''' 
</P>
<P>
	He signed a four-year contract paying him $100,000 a season and  
guaranteeing at least $50,000 more for radio and TV work. He'll 
also receive a country club membership, use of a car, use of the 
school's Hammons Student Center for summer basketball camps, and 
various cash incentives for taking the team to a conference 
championship or to the NCAA tournament.

<HEADLINE> `60 Minutes' Does Well in Ratings / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Nielsen Media Research ratings brought smiles  
for some, frowns for others at CBS News this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``60 Minutes'' tied with ``Frasier'' as the most-watched  
prime-time show last week, Nielsen said Tuesday. It was the second 
time this season the venerable newsmagazine has topped the ratings, 
the first time that has happened in five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the network's decision to send ``CBS Evening News''  
anchor Dan Rather to report from Belgrade last week failed to pay 
off in the ratings. ABC anchor Peter Jennings and NBC anchor Tom 
Brokaw stayed in New York while Rather traveled. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS continued its evening news ratings slump, finishing well  
behind ABC's ``World News Tonight'' and the ``NBC Nightly News.'' 
CBS saw a 2 percent increase in its news viewership over the 
previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jennings-led ABC broadcast finished with a 7.6 rating and 17  
share, NBC had a 7.3 rating and 16 share and CBS was at 6.4 and 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Reruns dominated the prime-time landscape last week and,  
typically, many TV viewers went elsewhere. CBS won the week with an 
8.3 rating and 14 share, NBC had a 7.7 rating and 13 share, ABC was 
at 6.8 and 12 and Fox was at 6.0 and 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Two specials pleased executives at ABC and UPN. ``David Blaine:  
Magic Man,'' the one-hour ABC show about the magician, finished 
tied for 15th in the week's ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scared Straight! 20 Years Later,'' UPN's update of a memorable  
20-year-old documentary about prison inmates trying to convince 
delinquent youth to stay away from crime, was the network's 
highest-rated Thursday night telecast ever. 
</P>
<P>
	It enabled UPN, with its 2.2 rating and 4 share for the week, to  
pull closer than usual to the WB, which had a 2.7 rating and 5 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of April 12-18, the top 10 shows, their networks  
and ratings were: ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 12.7; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 
12.7; ``Friends,'' NBC, 12.0; ``CBS Sunday Movie: Having Our Say,'' 
CBS, 11.8; ``ER,'' NBC, 11.6; ``Just Shoot Me'' special, NBC, 11.4; 
``Will &AMP; Grace,'' NBC, 11.3; ``Touched By an Angel,'' CBS, 11.2; 
``Law and Order,'' NBC, 10.4; ``Dateline NBC-Monday,'' NBC, 10.0; 
``The Practice,'' ABC, 10.0.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Public Housing Gets High Grades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Maligned through the years as crime-ridden and  
dirty, the nation's public housing stock received high grades after 
the first round of unprecedented physical inspections, Housing and 
Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspection results, showing that 87 percent of the 750  
housing authorities checked received good or excellent grades, 
indicate public housing is an untold success story, Cuomo said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stereotype on public housing is that its a failure,''  
Cuomo said. ``We've allowed that impression to be set and continue 
for decades, but that is not what public housing is about. The vast 
majority of the 3,400 public housing authorities across this nation 
are successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a ceremony honoring the highly rated housing authorities,  
Cuomo said the evaluations of physical and financial conditions at 
the 750 housing authorities found 23 percent operating at excellent 
levels, 64 at good levels and 13 percent in need of improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	HUD trained and dispatched inspectors to examine building  
exteriors, common areas, building systems and randomly selected 
apartment units in each development. The inspectors also checked 
that safety certificates for boilers, elevators, fire alarms and 
sprinkler systems were current. 
</P>
<P>
	HUD provides funding to 3,400 housing authorities nationwide. A  
HUD spokesman said the remaining inspections should be completed by 
October.

<HEADLINE> Olympics Working To Save Sponsors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The U.S. Olympic Committee is getting some  
help to recruit scandal-shy corporate sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We recognized that we had a very tall task and a long way to  
go'' in raising money, Mitt Romney, president of the Salt Lake 
Organizing Committee, said Wednesday in announcing the hiring of a 
sports marketing company. ``If our coffers were full ... we 
wouldn't need to bring in another team member.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hiring of International Management Group, which handled  
sponsorship sales for the 1992 Winter Games in Albertville, France; 
the 1994 Winter Games in Lillehammer, Norway; and the 1992 Summer 
Games in Barcelona, comes at a time when USOC and SLOC have been at 
odds over funding. 
</P>
<P>
	USOC and SLOC have a joint marketing venture, called Olympic  
Properties of the United States -- OPUS -- which is $300 million 
short of its goal of raising $859 million in contributions and 
in-kind services. 
</P>
<P>
	USOC officials blame the Salt Lake City bribery scandal for the  
marketing woes, while some officials connected with the Salt Lake 
City organizing effort have said that the marketing was going 
slowly even before the scandal hit late last year. Romney has 
called the OPUS goal ``very optimistic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just one sponsor -- longtime Olympic backer Seiko -- has signed  
with the USOC since it was revealed that Salt Lake City bid 
officials gave scholarships, lavish gifts, land deals, free trips 
and other perks to International Olympic Committee members and 
their families as the city tried to land the games. It was 
announced this week that Johnson &AMP; Johnson has backed out of an 
estimated $30 million sponsorship deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were way ahead of the curve ... and then I think the  
marketplace and the Olympic family have been distracted by the 
scandal,'' USOC marketing head John Krimsky Jr. said. ``We have to 
hit the ground running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Prazmark, IMG senior vice president of business  
development, who will spearhead the Olympic sales pitch, said, 
``OPUS is not out of time. They just lost their cushion of time and 
they just have to be flawless the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
	He said companies are asking themselves if the Olympic name has  
been tarnished by the scandal, whereas before, ``that question was 
never raised.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prazmark said the companies he has dealt with remain eager to  
help make the Olympics a success. 
</P>
<P>
	The marketing deal extends through 2004 and applies to the U.S.  
Olympic teams for the Sydney, Salt Lake City and Athens games. 
Krimsky said 80 percent of the money generated will go to stage the 
2002 Winter Games in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	IMG will be paid a commission for sponsors it brings to the  
USOC, but the officials refused to disclose the percentage the 
company would earn. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's far, far, far, far below industry standards,'' Prazmark  
said. ``It still has to be a business decision, but there's a lot 
of wanting to help out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said IMG agreed to waive its commission for Utah-based  
sponsors. Also, the USOC has agreed to compensate SLOC for 
commission payments until the $859 million target for sponsorship 
revenues is reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Prazmark said as many as 50 of the company's 2,000 staff members  
worldwide could work on the Olympic sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives us arms and legs we simply don't have today,''  
Krimsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a long way to go,'' Romney said. ``But (the SLOC and  
USOC) agree it makes sense not to just keep playing with the same 
number of players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romney, who was hired to take over the Salt Lake City Olympics  
planning in the wake of the scandal, has been preparing budget cuts 
in case the fund-raising efforts fall short. 
</P>
<P>
	One of his potential cuts involved operating expenses for the  
Winter Sports Park, which has ski jumps, the bobsled-luge track and 
the Oquirrh Skating Oval -- the speedskating venue.

<HEADLINE> USDA Defends Crop Insurance System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Agriculture Department investigators say they  
have found widespread evidence of errors and abuse in the federally 
subsidized crop insurance program in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have instance after instance in all parts of the country  
... where we find problems,'' James Ebbitt, the Agriculture 
Department's assistant inspector general in charge of audits, told 
the Senate Agriculture Committee on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A report issued last month by the inspector general said the  
insurance system was prone to abuse because taxpayers bear most of 
the risk for losses, not the private companies that sell and 
service the policies. 
</P>
<P>
	The report alleged that insurance claims are frequently  
rubber-stamped by adjusters to keep producers from dropping out of 
the program. The companies keep a share of the premiums that 
farmers pay. The report also cited cases in which sales agents 
worked for the farmers to whom they sold insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with USDA's Risk Management Agency say they have  
corrected most of the problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We run a clean program,'' said agency Administrator Ken  
Ackerman. ``It is cleaner or as clean as any (insurance) program 
run in the private sector.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ackerman conceded that the report painted ``a very damning  
picture,'' but he said it ``presents only part of the picture,'' 
and he criticized it for several factual errors. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the department increased the financial risk to the  
private companies that handle the policies and reduced the fees 
they receive, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The program costs the government $1.4 billion a year, but  
Congress is considering doubling that by 2001 to make the coverage 
cheaper for producers and to expand the insurance to more crops and 
even livestock. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past four years, the government has paid $5.4 billion  
to farmers, while the companies have received $2.8 billion in 
administrative fees and profits on the business. Sen. Kent Conrad, 
D-N.D., expressed alarm at the size of the companies' earnings. 
``It seems way out of line to me,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the insurance companies say crop losses have been unusually  
low in recent years, and their profits could evaporate in one year 
with a widespread drought. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, when insurance premiums exceed losses, insurance  
companies will not show a loss. That is simply a sign of a good 
year, not evidence of a bad system,'' said Ron Brichler, chairman 
of National Crop Insurance Services, an industry group. 
</P>
<P>
	But Conrad said after the hearing that the report raised  
troubling questions that would make it more difficult to get 
Congress to increase funding for the insurance system. 
</P>
<P>
	``This adds to the challenge,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Rubber Fish May Help Salmon Survive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Heard of crash test dummies? Now there's a  
crash test salmon. 
</P>
<P>
	Engineers on Wednesday unveiled Flubber, a six-inch rubbery  
replica of a young salmon packed with wires and sensors. 
</P>
<P>
	The fake fish will spurt through the churning, 10-foot-long  
blades of the McNary hydropower dam on the Washington-Oregon border 
next month to measure how salmon are jostled, scraped and even 
killed on their treacherous journey downstream. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea is to document with data what fish experience,'' said  
George Hecker, president of Alden Research Laboratory Inc. in 
Holden, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	The synthetic salmon was developed at the Department of Energy's  
Richland, Wash., lab as part of a five-year, $8 million government 
effort to make hydropower dams more fish friendly. 
</P>
<P>
	Government scientists and some corporate partners, including  
Alden and Voith Hydro Power Generation of York, Pa., want to use 
the Flubber data and studies of real salmon to make better 
turbines. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the faux fish seems up to the job. It has been tested  
with a sledgehammer, a lighted candle and intense water pressure, 
said Bennie Rinehart, an engineer with Lockheed Martin Idaho 
Technologies Co., which helped finance the project. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything is working real good,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Industry experts say 90 percent of the fish that pass through a  
dam turbine survives. But with many salmon forced to go through and 
around eight large dams on the Snake and Columbia Rivers, the 
overall survival rate can be as low as 60 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	By changing the turbines' shape, the survival rate at a dam  
could rise to 98 percent, said Diane Lear, a Voith Hydro 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Pacific Northwest, 16 salmon species are considered  
threatened or endangered, and Congress has authorized more than 
$100 million a year on attempts to bring them back. 
Environmentalists consider most of these attempts expensive 
failures and are pushing for the partial removal of four Snake 
River dams. 
</P>
<P>
	But even a harsh critic of government salmon efforts, Justin  
Hayes of American Rivers, said it may have something useful in 
Flubber.

<HEADLINE> Colgate Posts Profit Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Colgate-Palmolive Co. posted a 6.6 percent  
earnings increase for the first quarter, narrowly beating Wall 
Street expectations and sending its stock price surging Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer products company known for Colgate toothpaste,  
Palmolive dish soap, Ajax cleanser and Mennen deodorant cited new 
products and sales growth in the United States for its improved 
results. 
</P>
<P>
	Colgate earned $208.9 million, or 65 cents a share, in the three  
months ended March 31, compared with $196.0 million, or 60 cents a 
share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were a penny per share ahead of the 64 cents  
expected by analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Colgate shares soared  
7.9 percent, rising $7.37 1/2 to $100.37 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose to $2.18 billion from $2.16 billion a year earlier.  
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose 11 percent in North America led by new products  
including Colgate Total Fresh Stripe toothpaste and premium Oral 
Care tooth brushes. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales fell 8 percent in Latin America, hurt by difficult  
economic conditions in Brazil and Ecuador. 
</P>
<P>
	In Europe, sales were level with strong results a year ago and  
would have risen 4 percent if economically-troubled Russia and its 
neighbors were excluded. Sales were slightly higher in Asia and 
Africa, 
</P>
<P>
	Hills Pet Food sales rose 6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Left Field to Left Out for Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Barry Bonds, his left arm in a cast  
extending nearly to his armpit, says the hardest part of dealing 
with his first serious injury will be watching his team on TV. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-time NL MVP, who had missed just 20 games in his first  
six seasons with San Francisco, is on the disabled list for the 
second time in 12 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only air is invincible,'' he said Wednesday during a visit to  
the Giants' clubhouse, one day after surgery to repair a triceps 
tendon and a bone spur in his elbow. ``Last time I checked, we're 
not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors told the Giants they'll be without Bonds for a minimum  
of 10 weeks. Bonds, who in the past has healed quickly from other 
injuries, cannot accept such a timetable. 
</P>
<P>
	He says the cast will come off Friday, and he'll immediately  
begin rehab. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight-time All-Star left fielder does not expect to go on  
the Giants' roadtrip to Montreal, New York and Pittsburgh beginning 
next Tuesday, so he can focus on rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'd rather I stay here because I can get more done rather  
than sitting in a hotel and then going to the ballpark,'' he said. 
``What am I going to do in Montreal and Pittsburgh?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Facing two months without baseball will be the toughest thing  
for the slugger, who was batting .366 with four homers and 12 RBIs 
and an .805 slugging percentage this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's painful to watch games on TV. It's just painful to me,''  
Bonds said. ``I'll be here (in the clubhouse) with them off and on. 
I'm not supposed to be here today, but I can't sit at home. That's 
not something I can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds said doctors told him the surgery had to be done now, or  
he could have risked ending a career during which he has become the 
only major leaguer with 400 homers and 400 stolen bases. He has 415 
homers and 447 steals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew it was have the surgery or maybe never play baseball  
again,'' he said. ``The doctors said, `What do you want to do? Play 
for several more years, or just roll the dice and maybe tear the 
whole entire biceps?' You never know if you can come back from 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds first felt pain in the elbow during a series at home  
against Houston last week. The pain kept getting more intense, and 
he told Giants manager Dusty Baker about it before Friday's game at 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	He tried playing and sleeping with a rubberized sleeve on the  
elbow, but the sensation worsened. If he spent too long in the 
outfield during an inning, he needed someone to rub his arm before 
batting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew something was wrong. I just didn't know what it was,''  
he said. ``I couldn't straighten my arm out. I felt like something 
was blocking me from extending my arm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds took a quick look around the clubhouse as teammates  
dressed for Wednesday's game against the Florida Marlins. Bonds was 
wearing a T-shirt and sweatpants. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to wear sweats, and I don't like to do that,'' he said.  
``I have to get back to work. Because this is what I do for a 
living.''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Profits Jump 43 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Strong performances across all of Microsoft  
Corp.'s product lines helped boost its quarterly profits by 43 
percent, the world's dominant maker of personal computer software 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite turmoil in the industry, the outlook for personal  
computers appears healthy, Greg Maffei, Microsoft's chief financial 
officer, said Tuesday after the financial figures were announced. 
He said Microsoft expects to continue to do well during the current 
quarter, as it brings out a new version of its industry-standard 
Office suite of business software. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said it earned $1.92 billion, or 35 cents a share, in  
its fiscal third quarter, which ended March 31. That was up from a 
profit of $1.34 billion, or 25 cents a share, in the year-ago 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose to $4.33 billion from $3.77 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	The profit beat the predictions of analysts surveyed by First  
Call Corp., who had expected 32 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft shares, which rose $2.12 1/2 a share Tuesday in  
anticipation of a strong report after the close of trading, was 
giving ground today. It dropped 2.5 percent, or by $2.06 1/4, to 
$81.06 1/4 a share at midmorning on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Not included in the third-quarter results is $400 million in  
revenue from early sales of Microsoft's new Office 2000 package of 
business software. Microsoft said it would defer that revenue into 
the current quarter. The product starts retail sales on June 10. 
</P>
<P>
	``Financially and operationally it was a very nice quarter, if  
somewhat complicated from an accounting standpoint,'' Maffei said 
on a conference call with reporters and analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd say it's more of the same in terms of where the growth is  
coming from,'' said Scott McAdams, president of brokerage McAdams 
Wright Ragen in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, which has no debt and pays no stock dividend, also  
reported a whopping $21.76 billion in cash and short-term 
investments, an increase of 56 percent from the $13.93 billion it 
had on hand last June 30. Long-term investments grew from $4.7 
billion to $7.47 billion in the past nine months. 
</P>
<P>
	The company doesn't have any new plans for its cash stockpile,  
said Carla Lewis, director of investor relations. Microsoft 
typically taps its reserves for research and development, business 
deals and to fund employee stock options. 
</P>
<P>
	Maffei partly tied the company's latest profit to strong demand  
for its server software, and said sales in Asia were rebounding. 
Licenses for SQL Server, its database software for large 
corporations, rose 50 percent from the year-ago quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Software sales to computer manufacturers were up 29 percent from  
last year, and sales of operating system software accounted for a 
bit more than $2 billion of the revenue for the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	While some manufacturers have suffered because of stronger  
demand for lower-cost computers, the higher number of machines sold 
benefited Microsoft, Maffei said. 
</P>
<P>
	``While there were jitters during the quarter and after, the PC  
market seems to be fundamentally healthy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said, however, that some customers were deferring  
purchases of new software in order to get ready for the so-called 
Y2K bug, in which computers incorrectly interpret the year 2000 as 
the year 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's Windows operating system runs the basic functions of

<HEADLINE> Shooting Comes Amid Colo. Gun Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The shooting rampage at a suburban Denver high  
school prompted state lawmaker to delay action on a bill that would 
help gun owners obtain concealed weapons permits. 
</P>
<P>
	Local government leaders have criticized the measure, which  
already has passed the state Senate. A House panel had planned to 
take up the measure today, but legislative leaders decided to 
postpone action in light of Tuesday's shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would require sheriffs to grant concealed weapons  
permits if applicants pass a number of conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Doug Dean, R-Colorado Springs, sponsor of the bill, said  
the Littleton tragedy might have been offset if a faculty member, 
or administrator, had been armed. 
</P>
<P>
	But George said he had received calls expressing the opposite.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm getting e-mails from people saying: `See what happens when  
you have guns? And you legislators are talking about allowing more 
guns in society, and here's the harm that comes.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Senate version of the bill, people couldn't carry  
their handguns on school grounds or into schools, government 
buildings or bars.

<HEADLINE> Indians' Logo Banned From Library </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Cuyahoga County library workers who are devoted  
Cleveland Indians fans will have to leave Chief Wahoo behind when 
coming to work. 
</P>
<P>
	Staff members are allowed to wear informal attire to support the  
Indians when the team has a home game. But the grinning, red-faced 
logo has been banned. 
</P>
<P>
	John A. Lonsak, executive director of the library system, sent a  
memo out recently to 700 employees explaining that Chief Wahoo is 
not the image the library should project. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a diversity issue,'' Lonsak said Tuesday. ``It's not a  
censorship or political issue at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He decided to ban the caricature in an effort ``to be sensitive  
to people of all ethnic backgrounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Richer Jr., 32, of Garfield Heights, who works as a  
clerk at the Beachwood branch of the county library, said Tuesday 
he misses wearing the logo to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``The library prides itself on not censoring,'' he said. ``It's  
completely unfair. Last year I could wear Wahoo all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Around Cleveland, Chief Wahoo is seen just about everywhere  
during the baseball season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have heard rumblings of discontent,'' Lonsak said.  
``Supervisors have told me some in the staff aren't happy with the 
fact they can't wear Wahoo images.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The logo has long been criticized as insensitive and demeaning,  
particularly by American Indians and church groups. The most recent 
protest was before the April 12 home opener outside of Jacobs 
Field, when an image of Chief Wahoo was burned. 
</P>
<P>
	Indians spokesman Bob DiBiasio said Tuesday he had no comment on  
the library ban. 
</P>
<P>
	``We understand that it's a sensitive issue,'' DiBiasio said.  
``There are a tremendous number of baseball fans who enjoy our name 
and logo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuyahoga County library system of 29 branches exists in  
suburbs. The Cleveland Public Library, which has 28 branches within 
Cleveland, has not banned Wahoo, spokesman Alan Seifullah said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vernon Bellecourt, president of the National Coalition on Racism  
in Sports and Media and a frequent Wahoo protester, on Tuesday said 
the library's policy is ``very helpful to our campaign. Obviously 
our message is beginning to get through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He described the logo as ``demeaning, degrading, dehumanizing,  
racist and a trivialization of a living people's identity.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Gov. Jesse Ventura said Wednesday the  
Colorado school shooting demonstrates the need for loosening 
restrictions on concealed weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Had there been someone who was armed, in this particular  
situation, in my opinion, it may have stabilized,'' the former 
professional wrestler-turned politician said. ``I believe it 
supports conceal and carry because of the fact that what happens 
when a group of unarmed individuals are confronted with people with 
weapons like this, you have no defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura obtained a permit to carry a concealed weapon after he  
was inaugurated in January. 
</P>
<P>
	He supports loosening handgun permit rules for non-criminals who  
complete gun-safety training and skills testing. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The school shooting was front page news in most  
American newspapers, but not the Chicago Sun Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Editors believed the carnage that swept through a Colorado high  
school was too violent for page one. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerned about the possibility that such prominent display  
``could harm or frighten vulnerable children,'' the Sun-Times 
spread the story across pages two, three and four. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see a danger that publicity surrounding such attacks could  
be contributing to the phenomenon,'' the paper added in a 
three-paragraph, page-one note to readers explaining its decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Editor in Chief Nigel Wade said the decision provided at least a  
measure of protection for youngsters who could be shaken by the 
story. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not leaving anything out, but we're putting the story  
where adults will find it,'' Wade said. ``We're also giving parents 
a chance to decide whether their children will see it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time that the Sun-Times decided to play school  
violence inside rather than on the front page. The first came after 
a May 21, 1998, shooting in Springfield, Ore., in which two 
teen-agers were shot to death and more than 20 people hurt.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- National Rifle Association president Charlton  
Heston said there should be armed guards in the nation's schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there had been even one armed guard in the school, he could  
have saved a lot of lives and perhaps ended the whole thing 
instantly,'' the actor told ABC news Wednesday after the Colorado 
school shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said the shooters, believed to be part of a group dubbed  
the Trenchcoat Mafia, should not have been allowed to wear black 
coats to school. 
</P>
<P>
	``C'mon. That's outrageous in a school,'' Heston said. ``I'm  
afraid you have to blame the parents of those two boys.''

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The two gunmen in the Colorado school rampage  
were influenced by hate-preaching Web sites that have multiplied as 
the Internet continues to flourish, Simon Wiesenthal Center 
officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet providers that are allowing this stuff to go  
online may want to reconsider whether they want to take a check 
from these individuals, whether they're anarchists, terrorists, 
neo-Nazis or just confused children,'' said Rabbi Abraham Cooper, 
associate dean of the center. 
</P>
<P>
	The center's founder and dean, Rabbi Marvin Hier, called on  
President Clinton to institute a tolerance and sensitivity 
curriculum in every school in the country. ``We need more than 
better security and counseling,'' Hier told reporters at a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys, who were apparently Internet enthusiasts, could have  
easily accessed instructions on how to make bombs using links from 
Internet sites posted by hate groups, Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gunman Eric Harris appears to have had an America Online Web  
site filled with apocalyptic imagery and apparent bomb diagrams.

	``I'm pulling it,'' said House Majority Leader Doug Dean, a

for concealed weapons. The measure had caused long debates in 
several committees and on the Senate floor. 
</P>

	Rep. Gary McPherson, another Republican and the sponsor of a  
bill to let a state law override local ordinances on gun control, 
also said he is asking that the bill be set aside.

<HEADLINE> Everglades Fire Contained </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A fire that has been scorching the Everglades for a  
week, charring an area of sawgrass 24 miles long and 15 miles wide, 
may be burning itself out at last, firefighters said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to make sure the fire doesn't escape the area we have  
it confined to,'' said John Fish, a state Division of Forestry 
spokesman. ``We're considering it contained but still not under 
control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If firefighters keep the South Florida blaze contained, it  
should burn itself out, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	No homes have been damaged in the fire, which is burning in a  
section of the Everglades' roughly 2 million acres that is outside 
Everglades National Park. Columns of smoke have been visible for 
miles as the fire scorched through nearly 170,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	Dry weather has turned the Everglades vegetation into kindling,  
and no significant rainfall is forecast through the end of the 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	The weather had state officials fearing a repeat of last  
summer's wildfires, which blackened nearly 500,000 acres and forced 
100,000 people from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Interstate 75, South Florida's main east-west highway known as  
Alligator Alley, was ordered closed again Wednesday as thick smoke 
hung overhead, hindering visibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Levees, canals and a four-lane highway helped firefighters hold  
the flames inside a section of the Everglades more than 20 miles 
west of Fort Lauderdale. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty Navajo firefighters from Arizona joined about 25 other  
firefighters at the fire's northern edge to try to keep flames from 
spreading north of a canal that runs along Broward County's 
northern boundary, Fish said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bureau of Indian Affairs firefighters, accompanied by  
water-tanker trucks, were trying to put out smoldering embers, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The blaze started in the eastern Everglades late last week and  
may have been ignited by heat from a vehicle's catalytic converter. 
The cause was still being investigated, Fish said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aided by swirling winds, the fire quickly became the largest of  
at least 2,568 wildfires that have burned more than 230,000 acres 
in Florida this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Florida Agriculture Commissioner Bob Crawford ordered  
his agency to stop granting permits required in most cases for 
outdoor burning. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just too dangerous,'' said Terence McElroy, an  
agriculture department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	State emergency management officials counted wildfires burning  
it at least 12 of Florida's 67 counties Wednesday. They also 
counted 140 homes and buildings damaged or destroyed in wildfires 
this year -- most of them in St. Lucie County last week -- and 18 
firefighters injured so far. 
</P>
<P>
	In northern Florida's Apalachicola National Forest, two blazes  
burned more than 2,000 acres, but firefighters had both contained 
Wednesday, said Gene Madden, a spokesman for the state Division of 
Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters in the Osceola National Forest in Baker County used  
tractors and helicopters against a 2,000-acre fire.

<HEADLINE> Court Takes Up Disabled Care Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supreme Court justices worried aloud Wednesday  
that mentally disabled people might be ``abandoned on the streets'' 
if an anti-bias law is judged to give them a broad right to live in 
homelike settings rather than state hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	``What bothers me is writing something which, as it works out in  
the real world, leaves many who need to be in institutions out, 
abandoned on the streets,'' Justice Stephen G. Breyer said as the 
court considered a Georgia case that could yield the decade's most 
important ruling on treatment for the mentally disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	Questions and comments from Justices John Paul Stevens and  
Sandra Day O'Connor suggested similar concerns, and Justice David 
H. Souter appeared most hostile to Georgia's side of the case, but 
the hour-long argument session gave no clear indication how the 
nine-member court will rule. 
</P>
<P>
	The court is to decide by late June whether the Americans with  
Disabilities Act and a related regulation require community 
placement of the mentally disabled whenever appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruling on a lawsuit by two Georgia women, lower courts said such  
placement is required unless living up to the 1990 federal law 
would fundamentally change a state's services to the mentally 
disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, about 70,000 mentally disabled people are in state  
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1991 federal regulation requires services provided by state  
and local governments to be delivered ``in the most integrated 
setting appropriate to the needs'' of disabled persons, and 
O'Connor suggested defining that phrase is at the heart of the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is that what it boils down to?'' she asked. Georgia Senior  
Assistant Attorney General Patricia Downing responded, ``Yes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It cannot be assumed that because one option is appropriate  
another is not,'' Downing said in contending that states are free 
to choose between treatment in community settings and hospitals. 
She said hospital treatment may be preferred for policy, medical or 
financial reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	But Michael Gottesman, a Georgetown University law professor  
representing the two women, called their ``isolation and 
segregation from the societal mainstream of American life'' a 
violation of the federal ban on discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Elaine Wilson and Lois Curtis sued Georgia to get out of a state  
mental hospital. They had been approved for community-based care 
but faced long waiting lists. Now in group homes, both women were 
in the audience that packed the courtroom Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Souter suggested that treating people able to live outside a  
mental hospital the same as those who cannot is a form of 
discrimination. When he asked Downing whether his suggestion was 
unreasonable, she answered, ``Respectfully, I believe it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly sympathetic to the state was Justice Antonin Scalia.  
``Is Georgia required to have community placements?'' he asked 
Downing, and appeared satisfied when she responded, ``No, this law 
doesn't require it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At times, the justices hurled successive hypothetical questions  
more rapidly than they could be answered, leading Chief Justice 
William H. Rehnquist to read for his colleagues just what the court 
had agreed to decide. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyer Irving Gornstein, representing the  
Clinton administration, joined Gottesman in pressing for a more 
expansive view of the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Numerous advocacy groups for the mentally disabled, the American  
Psychiatric Association, American Civil Liberties Union and 58 
former state officials with leadership roles in mental health 
treatment are lined up as friends of the court opposing Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Conference of State Legislatures and seven  
individual states are among those siding with Georgia: Colorado, 
Hawaii, Montana, Nevada, Tennessee, Texas and Wyoming.

<HEADLINE> Court Asked To Review Hopwood Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- The University of Texas has asked a federal  
appeals court to reconsider a decision that led to the elimination 
of affirmative action policies at the state's public colleges and 
universities. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials asked the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on  
Tuesday to reconsider its so-called Hopwood ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case addresses one of the most important issues of our  
time ... and it deserves the fullest possible hearing and a most 
careful decision by the federal courts,'' said Larry Faulkner, 
president of the university. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hopwood ruling came in a lawsuit against the University of  
Texas law school's former affirmative-action admissions policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling, which found that the policy discriminated against  
whites, was allowed to stand in 1996 by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Attorney General Dan Morales then issued a legal opinion  
directing Texas colleges to adopt race-neutral policies for 
admissions, financial aid and scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislators asked new Attorney General John Cornyn for a second  
opinion. His office helped university officials write the appeal 
submitted Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	According to University of Texas System Regent Patrick Oxford,  
the Hopwood ruling left Texas at a competitive disadvantage with 
other public universities in recruiting students. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal argues that limited consideration of race in  
admissions is necessary to overcome the effects of past 
discrimination. It also says the school has a compelling interest 
in a racially and ethnically diverse student body. 
</P>
<P>
	A state Comptroller's Office study released in January showed a  
drop in the number of minorities applying for, being admitted to 
and enrolling in some of the state's most selective public schools.

<HEADLINE> Final Aaron Home Run Ball Auctioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The final home-run baseball hit by Hank Aaron  
has earned $650,000, most of it for a former Milwaukee County 
Stadium groundskeeper who recovered the ball in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	Guernsey's, a New York auction house that arranged the sale,  
declined Tuesday to identify the buyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew J. Knuth, who runs an investment company in Westport,  
Conn., refused comment concerning reports he was the purchaser, the 
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Arndt, 52, now a furniture salesman in Albuquerque,  
N.M., worked at the stadium July 20, 1976, when Aaron hit his final 
career homer, his 755th. 
</P>
<P>
	Arndt says he offered to give the ball to Aaron but the  
Milwaukee Brewers never arranged a meeting, firing him instead for 
not surrendering the ball to the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron autographed the ball at a collector's show a few years  
ago, unaware of what it was. He has tried twice to buy the ball 
from Arndt, who says he decided last fall to auction it after the 
Brewers declined to buy it. 
</P>
<P>
	Arndt gets $461,700 from the Guernsey's sale. In keeping with a  
promise to Aaron, $155,800 goes to Chasing the Dream Foundation, an 
Atlanta group that helps underprivileged children. Guernsey's keeps 
the balance as a commission. 
</P>
<P>
	A ceremony marking the anniversary of the home run is planned  
July 20 in Milwaukee County Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewers spokesman Laurel Prieb said Aaron plans to attend.  
</P>
<P>
	Arndt's agent, Tim Sullivan of Stevens Point, said the ball may  
be displayed at the ballpark, but Prieb said the team has not 
discussed it.

<HEADLINE> Groups Seek To Clean Up Miss. River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A $1.1 billion infusion of federal money to  
reverse the buildup of sediment and pollution in the upper 
Mississippi River may be a smart investment, according to a new 
plan for the river's future. 
</P>
<P>
	Keeping the river's navigation channels free of silt alone costs  
$100 million a year, according to the review released Wednesday by 
a coalition of environmentalists and others concerned about the 
Mighty Mississippi's future. 
</P>
<P>
	And farmers lose more than $320 million a year from having to  
apply extra nitrogen fertilizer due to runoff, adding to the cost 
of habitat preservation and municipal water treatment, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	So the group is asking Congress for $1.1 billion in federal  
funds over the next 10 years -- which would represent a 40 percent 
increase over current annual spending -- to help cure the 
Mississippi's ills and make such expensive fixes unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you put it in the context of how much we're spending to  
fix problems -- or not to fix problems -- it really isn't a lot of 
money,'' said Barry Drazkowski, co-director of the Winona, 
Minn.-based Resource Studies Center, which assembled the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wis., co-chairman of Congress' Upper  
Mississippi River Task Force, said the plan needs solid promises of 
funding from the states in the watershed before it will find much 
support in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't get cooperation and commitment at the state and  
local level, it's not going to go very far,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan grew out of a collaboration between environmental  
groups and barge interests to find a compromise in addressing the 
river's needs. 
</P>
<P>
	At stake is the future transportation of the 90 million tons of  
cargo on the Mississippi, as well as the region's $1.2 billion 
recreation industry, drinking water quality and important habitats 
for over 400 species. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the river's chief problems are:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Sediment buildups in backwater areas that suffocate underwater  
plants, deprive fish of food and shelter, and clog navigation 
channels, which then require costly dredging. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Fertilizer and other pollutants that flow from farmland and  
new residential developments and contaminate the water. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan calls for expanding federal programs that give farmers  
technical advice about making crop production more environmentally 
friendly and pay them to change their farming practices. 
Participation would remain voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal also says federal agencies should have more  
flexibility to target areas most in need of help, even a single 
stream or farm. That means greater cooperation between the 75 
local, state, federal and private programs now working to improve 
the river. 
</P>
<P>
	Those many programs are doing little now to improve conditions  
on the river because there is so little cooperation and so many 
misdirected efforts, said Scott Faber with American Rivers, one of 
the groups leading the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some places we're spending too much money ... and in some  
places we're spending no money,'' Faber said. ``It sounds crazy, 
but we've never stepped back and asked ourselves how we can best 
spend our resources in the upper Mississippi region.''

<HEADLINE> 5 Picked To Register Web Addresses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The organization that will manage much of the  
Internet selected five companies Wednesday, including America 
Online, to help consumers register Web addresses. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and  
Numbers represents an important 60-day experiment aimed at opening 
the worldwide computer network to capitalist competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers who want to register addresses now must pay at least  
$35 each year to Virginia-based Network Solutions Inc., which has 
enjoyed a lucrative exclusive agreement with the government since 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Under plans announced Wednesday, people can instead pay AOL or  
four other companies or continue doing business with Network 
Solutions, which also will continue to administer a master list of 
more than 4 million Web addresses ending in ``com,'' ``net'' or 
``org.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AOL Senior Vice President George Vradenburg called it ``an  
important step in the Internet's evolution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Seidman, who distributes an e-mail newsletter about AOL  
to 50,000 subscribers, predicted that the world's largest Internet 
provider will encourage its more than 17 million members to 
register vanity Web addresses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty easy to see that they'll try to get to the space  
of personal vanity Web site hosting,'' Seidman said. ``They have a 
huge infrastructure from a promotional point of view to support 
that. The opportunity for them is going to be huge. There, they'll 
have an advantage over anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for Network Solutions administering the master list  
of addresses, the five companies agreed to pay it a one-time fee of 
$100,000, plus $9 per year for each address they register. 
</P>
<P>
	That helped propel Network Solutions stock 53 percent higher  
Wednesday; it rose $32 to close at $92. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL hasn't decided what price it will ultimately charge  
consumers, spokesman Jim Whitney said, adding that ``questions of 
marketing, pricing, are all for down the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Network Solutions said it will continue charging $70 for the  
first two years, then $35 annually afterward. Another plan offered 
by the company costs $119 but includes other services. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. government announced last year it plans to largely end  
its management of the Internet and turn over control of most 
functions to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and 
Numbers, a California-based nonprofit group. 
</P>
<P>
	The government would still be responsible for assigning Internet  
addresses with the ``gov'' and ``mil'' suffixes for federal 
agencies and military institutions, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	The other four companies selected were the Internet Council of  
Registrars, France Telecom, Melbourne IT and Register.Com.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- John Broome, a DC Comics writer whose 25-year  
career included work on the superheroes Green Lantern and Flash, 
died of a heart attack March 14 while traveling through Thailand. 
He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Broome, who wrote under his own name and the pseudonyms John  
Osgood and Edgar Ray Merritt, was responsible for the colorful 
writing in The Justice Society of America. The comic depicted the 
first team of superheroes. 
</P>
<P>

written from the chimp's viewpoint. Broome also wrote the comic 
Atomic Knights. 
</P>
<P>
	Green Lantern, first created in the 1940s, was revised by Broome  
in the '50s and '60s. He also wrote most of the stories of Flash 
during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
	After retiring in 1970, Broome moved to Paris and later to  
Tokyo, where he taught English.

	Hollett played for the Ottawa Senators, Toronto Maple Leafs,  
Boston Bruins and Detroit Red Wings between 1933 and 1946. He set

broke it by just one goal 24 years later. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollett, nicknamed Flash for his speed, scored the winning goal  
in the Stanley Cup final on April 16, 1939, to give the Bruins a 
3-1 win over Toronto. He retired in 1946.

</P>
<P>
	HEREFORD, Texas (AP) -- Orvil Gene ``Speedy'' Nieman, publisher  
of the Hereford Brand for 26 years, died Monday after a long 
illness. He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
	Nieman had retired July 1 as publisher and president of The  
Brand and North Plains Printing, Inc., and assumed the honorary 
title of publisher emeritus. He wrote his weekly column, ``Hereford 
Bull,'' until March, when ill health prevented him from coming to 
the office every day. 
</P>
<P>
	He had served as a director and president of the Texas Press  
Association, president of the Panhandle Press Association and 
president of the West Texas Press Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Nieman was editor of the Lamesa Daily Reporter in 1951 before  
going back to Texas Tech to complete his journalism degree. While 
at Tech, he worked as a sports writer at the Lubbock 
Avalanche-Journal and as a sports reporter and editor at Lamesa. 
</P>
<P>
	Nieman graduated in 1954 and went to work as a sports writer at  
the San Angelo Standard-Times. He later was editor of newspaper 
operations for the Lamesa Daily Reporter, Brownfield News and Lamb 
County Leader News. He worked on the news staff at the Midland 
Reporter-Telegram in 1964 before he became publisher, editor and 
co-owner of the Slaton Slatonite in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	He and his wife, Lavon, published the Slatonite until 1971, when  
they sold their interest and entered a partnership with Roberts 
Publishing Co. of Andrews to purchase The Hereford Brand and its 
printing plant. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1972, Nieman became publisher, editor and partner in the  
Brand and the newly re-organized North Plains Printing. Nieman 
converted the Brand from a semi-weekly to a five-day daily 
newspaper in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, two sons and two grandchildren.

	HOUSTON (AP) -- John G. Ryan, a director and former president and  
chief operating officer of Global Marine Inc., died Sunday of skin 
cancer at the age of 46. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan was elected president and chief operating officer of Global  
Marine in May 1997. The Houston-based company is one of the largest 
offshore drilling contractors and the world's largest provider of 
offshore drilling management services. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan joined the company in 1982 as assistant general counsel and

                      *Hernando Santos Castillo    	
</P>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Hernando Santos Castillo, chairman of  
the El Tiempo newspaper and a political powerbroker who was perhaps 
the most influential Colombian journalist of his generation, died 
Tuesday from complications of a cerebral hemorrhage suffered April 
7. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
	Santos was close to every Colombian president since 1958. He  
helped some get elected with endorsements in the country's leading 
newspaper and counseled them all. 
</P>
<P>
	Santos' father, Enrique Santos Montejo, was a celebrated  
columnist and his granduncle, Eduardo Santos, was a former 
president who founded El Tiempo in 1911. 
</P>
<P>
	Santos became El Tiempo's news editor in the 1960s, sharing the  
position with his older brother Enrique, and took over as chairman 
two decades later. Enrique Santos remains managing editor of the 
newspaper, where five of Hernando's seven children work alongside 
two of Enrique's. 
</P>
<P>
	Up until his death, Hernando Santos was a full-time journalist  
who worked nearly every day. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past two decades, El Tiempo has hedged against hard  
times by expanding into cable television, book publishing and 
telecommunications. But Hernando Santos' main role was always as 
editorial director of the newspaper, which generally reflected the 
orientation of his grandfather's Liberal Party.

                           *Senor Wences    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Senor Wences, the master ventriloquist who  
delighted ``Ed Sullivan Show'' audiences by bantering in a comic 
Spanish accent with his puppet-in-a-box Pedro (``S'OK?'' 
``S'awright!'') and his falsetto-voiced hand puppet Johnny, died 
Tuesday at 103. 
</P>
<P>
	Wences, whose real name was Wenceslao Moreno, bickered and  
bantered with his puppets while he drank, smoked and juggled. 
</P>
<P>
	One of his puppets was gravelly-voiced Pedro, who consisted only  
of a head in a box. 
</P>
<P>
	Another puppet was Johnny, whose comeback line was: ``Deefeecult  
for you, easy for me.'' Wences created Johnny by scrunching up his 
fist, drawing a mouth where thumb and index finger met, and draping 
a blond wig over the top. 
</P>
<P>
	Wences would talk to his puppets with his face right in theirs,  
as if daring the audience to watch his lips, which, of course, 
never moved. 
</P>
<P>
	In between his many Sullivan show appearances, Wences  
entertained four presidents, toured with Dean Martin &AMP; Jerry Lewis, 
did a Broadway show with Danny Kaye and played every casino in 
Vegas. He continued touring into his early 90s.

                        *Charlie Whittingham    	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Charlie Whittingham, one of the greatest  
trainers in thoroughbred racing and twice a winner of the Kentucky 
Derby, died Tuesday of leukemia. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Whittingham, a trainer for 62 years, prepared more than 2,500  
winners. The two biggest were Ferdinand (1986) and Sunday Silence 
(1989). Ferdinand made him, at 73, the oldest trainer to win the 
Derby. He was oldest again at 76 when Sunday Silence won the 1989 
Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	Whittingham was inducted into racing's Hall of Fame in 1974. He  
was the leading trainer in career victories at both Santa Anita and 
Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
	He won thoroughbred racing Eclipse Awards as top trainer in  
1971, 1982 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	He held the national earnings title seven times, from 1970-73,  
1975, and 1981-82. His top earnings year was 1989 -- $11.4 million. 
More than 20 of the horses he trained had career earnings over $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	He was also the leading career trainer at Santa Anita and  
Hollywood Park.

<HEADLINE> Only Tiniest Newborns at High Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The outlook for tiny newborns isn't as bleak as previously  
thought. 
</P>
<P>
	Among full-term babies, only the smallest 3 percent face a  
significantly increased risk of death or life-threatening illnesses 
in their first few weeks, a study published in Thursday's New 
England Journal of Medicine found. Obstetricians have long believed 
that the smallest 10 percent were in danger. 
</P>
<P>
	For premature babies, the study didn't find a clear cutoff  
point. But the risk of respiratory distress, life-threatening 
bloodstream infections, seizures and death increased the smaller 
and the more premature they were. 
</P>
<P>
	Babies at the 3 percent mark weighed 5 pounds, 13 ounces,  
compared with 7 pounds, 7 ounces, for the ``typical'' baby. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message for mothers is that it's really only the smallest,  
smallest of the babies that seem to be at greatest risk,'' said Dr. 
Steven L. Bloom, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at 
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Bloom and colleague Dr. Donald D. McIntire studied 82,361  
full-term babies and 12,317 preemies born at Dallas' Parkland 
Hospital from 1988 through mid-1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The smallest 3 percent of full-term babies were three times more  
likely to die and at least two times more likely to have major 
illnesses than average babies. Still, only three of every 1,000 of 
those tiniest babies died. 
</P>
<P>
	Among premature babies, problems were far more common among the  
``youngest'' babies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just how small you are,'' McIntire said. ``It's also  
how soon you are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Jonelle C. Rowe of the National Institute of Child Health  
and Human Development said the study will help obstetricians 
managing risky pregnancies.

<HEADLINE> United, Bayern Munich in Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Two runners-up will play in the European Champions Cup final.  
</P>
<P>
	Manchester United, second to Arsenal in last season's English  
Premier League, and Bayern Munich, second to Kaiserslautern in the 
German Bundesliga, advanced to final with victories tonight and 
will play May 26 at Barcelona, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	After falling behind on a pair of goals by Filippo Inzaghi in  
the first 11 minutes, Manchester United won 3-2 at Juventus of 
Turin 3-2 to capture the home-and-home, total-goals series 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy Keane (21st minute), Dwight Yorke (34th) and Andy Cole  
(84th) scored for Manchester United, in the final for the first 
time since 1968. Juventus had been in three straight finals, 
winning in 1996 and losing the following two years. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be the first time since 1991 that an Italian team  
failed to make the final. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very proud moment for me,'' United coach Alex Ferguson  
said. ``The players kept their composure and they deserve to be in 
the final.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bayern, which won the cup three straight times from 1974-76 and  
lost in the final in 1982 and 1987, beat visiting Dynamo Kiev 1-0 
and advanced on 4-3 aggregate. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Basler scored in the 36th minute following a spectacular  
solo run. Bayern had trailed 3-1 in the first leg before coming 
back to tie. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basler has had to take a lot of criticism in recent months.  
Today he was our driving force,'' Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld 
said.

<HEADLINE>  World Horrified by School Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Remembering 16 tiny coffins after a gunman opened  
fire in a Scottish school three years ago, Britain urged the United 
States on Wednesday to respond to its deadliest school massacre by 
putting handguns out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain imposed a near-total ban on handguns after Thomas  
Hamilton used four legally owned guns to kill 16 kindergarten 
children and their teacher before killing himself on March 13, 
1996, in Dunblane. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's school attack by two Littleton, Colo., teen-agers who  
laughed as they shot victims and then killed themselves, stunned 
much of the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that they will look carefully at what this country did  
in banning handguns after the Dunblane massacre, and I hope we 
never have to wake up to this sort of news again from America,'' 
Defense Secretary George Robertson told British Broadcasting Corp. 
radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Many reports from around the world criticized the easy  
availability of guns in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``How sick is the gun society of America?'' mused an article in  
the Yomiuri daily in Japan, where reports focused on how the two 
suspects appeared to target minorities and athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The shooting has brought to light once again the warped  
strains of 'an advanced society,''' said an article in the national 
Asahi newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with Asahi, Mieko Hattori, the mother of a  
16-year-old Japanese exchange student in the United States who was 
fatally shot in 1992 while looking for a Halloween party, said she 
hoped the latest shootings would lead to tighter gun control laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guns are still everywhere. Even a high school student can get  
them,'' she was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Vatican, Pope John Paul II urged Americans to seek ``the  
moral vision and the values which alone can ensure respect for the 
inviolable dignity of human life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some weren't optimistic that this would happen.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is no reason to believe that America will now wake up,  
as President Bill Clinton hopes,'' said the Oslo, Norway, newspaper 
Aftenposten, pointing out that previous school killings had 
prompted little action. 
</P>
<P>
	British gun laws, now among the tightest in the world, allow  
police to seek the full medical history of anyone applying for a 
gun license, including details of any mental health problems. Every 
applicant must provide the names of two people who have known them 
for at least two years and who support their application. 
</P>
<P>
	The few exceptions to the ban include antique weapons, starting  
pistols, and small shot pistols used against rats, mice and other 
pests.

<HEADLINE>  Colo. School Checked for Booby Traps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Working around bodies still lying where  
they fell more than a day earlier, bomb squad officers checked 
lockers and backpacks for booby traps Wednesday as investigators 
tried to piece together one of the deadliest school massacres in 
U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurling bombs and blasting away with guns, two students in black  
trench coats killed 12 schoolmates and a teacher Tuesday at 
Columbine High School, most of them in the library. The gunmen, 
Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, then apparently killed 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials were trying to determine if others were involved, and  
they questioned the killers' parents and other members of the boys' 
dark group of outcasts, the ``Trenchcoat Mafia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parents waited for more than 24 hours after the attack until  
they finally received official word of their children's fate. Not 
until Wednesday afternoon were the first bodies removed from the 
scene. By 7 p.m., the other corpses all had been taken to the 
coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators had left the bodies in place for so long so they  
could check for explosives and record the details of the crime 
scene, which SWAT members described as something from ``Dante's 
Inferno.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many bodies were sprawled on the floor, slumped in desks or  
crouched beneath tables, boxes and cubicles where they apparently 
tried to hide. Police found a handgun under one of the killers, and 
a semiautomatic rifle and two sawed-off shotguns elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a different sort of chaos inside,'' SWAT Sgt. George  
Hinkle said. ``There were fire alarms going off, strobe lights, 
four inches of water in the cafeteria. We had been told there were 
bombs in backpacks and there were backpacks everywhere. It was the 
toughest tactical problem I've ever seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said 30 explosive devices had  
been found at Columbine, in the killers' vehicles and at their 
homes. Late Tuesday, more than 10 hours after the shootings, a time 
bomb blew up, but no one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of these devices are on timing devices, some are  
incendiary devices and some are pipe bombs,'' Sheriff John Stone 
told ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' ``Some are like hand grenades 
that have got shrapnel in them wrapped around butane containers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nine of the victims were male and four were female. District  
Attorney Dave Thomas said there was no evidence that the killers 
targeted minorities, as some students claimed. Only one of the 13 
victims was black. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've only seen the photographs, but it appears to me that most  
of the victims were victims because of where they were at a 
particular time, not that they were sought out,'' Thomas said. 
``Most of the victims were in the library, and that's where these 
two persons ended up. ... I don't know what the motive was other 
than anger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sixteen people remained hospitalized, 11 in critical or serious  
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunmen's families would not speak to reporters, but both  
issued statements Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our thoughts, prayers and heartfelt apologies go out to the  
victims, their families, friends, and the entire community,'' the 
Klebold family said. ``Like the rest of the country, we are 
struggling to understand why this happened, and ask that you please 
respect our privacy during this painful grieving period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris' parents said: ``We want to express our heartfelt  
sympathy to the families of all the victims and to all the 
community for this senseless tragedy. Please say prayers (for) 
everyone touched by these terrible events.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said Harris and Klebold targeted athletes and  
minorities, laughing at their victims and using a racial epithet to 
describe the black victim. ``All jocks stand up!'' one of the boys 
yelled during Tuesday's attack. ``We're going to kill every one of 
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some students lay still and quiet on the floor, listening as the  
gunmen finished off the wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Classmates said the boys were outcasts who wore black, spoke  
German to each other, played war games and sometimes wore Nazi 
symbols. According to classmates, the boys admired Adolf Hitler and 
apparently picked his birthday for the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine student Brooks Brown, 18, said Harris had once  
threatened to kill him, but later had resumed their friendship. 
Brown said he saw Harris carrying a duffel bag as he walked into 
the school on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was walking out for a cigarette and I told him, `Hey, man,'  
and he said, `Brooks, I like you. Now, get out of here. Go home.''' 
Brown said. ``And so I didn't think twice about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris and Klebold had a juvenile record, but not for anything  
violent -- they were caught breaking into a car. They completed a 
program that allowed them to clear their record, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	While investigators continued their work, memorial services were  
held across the city Wednesday, and dozens of counselors offered 
support to grieving students, parents, friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hundred students from around the Denver area gathered at  
a park near the school Wednesday, many with their parents. Bouquets 
were scattered around the grounds. Students placed flowers and 
other mementos on a car driven to school Tuesday by one of the 
students believed to be killed. 
</P>
<P>
	A poster on a wall in the park near the school contained  
messages of condolence and scorn. 
</P>
<P>
	``These flowers and prayers are for the innocent victims and  
their families, not for the two monsters that committed these 
selfish and violent acts,'' the poster said. ``Who were you two to 
decide what should happen to these people? We're here for you, 
Columbine High School. Love, Arvada West.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Red-eyed students, including one girl wearing a T-shirt listing  
the names of Columbine's '99 senior class, streamed into the Light 
of the World Church for a memorial service and a noon prayer vigil. 
</P>
<P>
	``How can you reassure someone who has just seen devastation?''  
said Rochelle Brunsdon of the Jefferson Center for Mental Health. 
``We're going to talk to people about the experience they've had, 
how they can go on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the church, visitors placed flowers and cards at the  
base of a weathered 12-foot cross leaning sideways against a tree. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, the district attorney, said that during the rampage, a  
representative of Klebold's father called authorities and said the 
father was willing to help negotiate, but the offer was rejected 
because officials felt there was little he could do. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear how the father might have known his son was  
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	The massacre forced the closing of all schools in the Jefferson  
County school district, which has 89,000 students and is Colorado's 
largest. Rick Kaufman, a district spokesman, said all schools 
except Columbine would open again Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials were examining ways to get Columbine students into  
other schools, because it was uncertain the school would open again 
before the end of the school year. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to the massacre, the National Rifle Association  
scaled back its annual meeting in Denver next week from three days 
to one as a show of sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
	Hockey's Colorado Avalanche postponed two playoff games in  
Denver this week, and baseball's Colorado Rockies on Wednesday 
called off their game for the second night in a row. Rockies 
players and coaches will wear a Columbine High patch on their 
sleeves for the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Bill Owens declared a state disaster and set aside $1  
million to help pay for costs associated with the massacre.

<HEADLINE> Guilty Verdict in Internet Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	APPLETON, Wis. (AP) -- A man accused of causing the harassment of  
a woman by posting her name, address and telephone number in a 
suggestive manner on the Internet has been found guilty of two 
misdemeanors in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Keith A. Schroeder, 34, of Menasha, was found guilty by an  
Outagamie County Circuit Court jury of unlawful use of a computer 
communications system and disorderly conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Dennis C. Luebke placed Schroeder on 18 months' probation  
on each count to run concurrently. He also ordered the defendant to 
complete 200 hours of community service and to have no contact with 
the victim. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges carried a maximum of 90 days in jail and a fine of  
$1,000 for each count. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have exposed this woman to significant embarrassment,  
ridicule, and exposed her to a vast potential for harassment and 
abuse,'' Luebke said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder was convicted in Winnebago County last year on 18  
counts of possession of child pornography. A two-year prison term 
in that case was stayed, and he was placed on probation and ordered 
to serve a jail term. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder, who claims the pornographic material was part of his  
research for a book on how parents can keep their children safe on 
the Internet, is appealing that conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman in the latest case in which Schroeder was convicted  
Tuesday said that, after she had a falling out with him, she began 
receiving phone calls at her workplace from men around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she later found a posting on America Online about her  
that stated, under hobbies: ``One night stand with any guy--as long 
as it is only once! Occupation: Fun stuff--call me at work.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Boxer Ayala Released From Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Tony Ayala choked back tears, clutched his  
wife's hand and walked through the prison gates. On the other side, 
his next opponent was waiting. 
</P>
<P>
	Where will this road to freedom lead?  
</P>
<P>
	Ayala, the once-promising fighter who derailed his life and many  
others in a night of drugs, booze and madness, was released from a 
New Jersey prison Tuesday after serving 16 years for rape. Images 
of his flamboyance and devastating speed were locked behind bars 
with him, along with thoughts of a terrible crime he can never 
forget. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Ayala already is dreaming of a comeback, the months and  
years ahead will determine what kind of man the fighter once known 
as ``The Little Bull'' has become. 
</P>
<P>
	``My whole focus was finding out what it was that caused me to  
behave in the manner that I did and fix myself,'' said Ayala, who 
was released for good behavior less than halfway through his 
35-year sentence. ``The fact that I committed this crime is 
something I will have to live with the rest of my life. It's not 
ever going to be forgotten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ayala, now 36, hasn't fought since he was a 19-year-old junior  
middleweight with a 22-0 record with 19 knockouts. His chance to be 
the Oscar De La Hoya of his day was ruined by drugs and alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early morning hours of New Year's Day 1983, Ayala  
returned to his Paterson, N.J., home after a night out with his 
wife, Lisa Paez. She went to bed. He said he was going to watch 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, stoked by heroin and booze, he went to the home of a  
female neighbor and raped her. At the time, he was on probation for 
beating a woman in the restroom of a San Antonio drive-in theater 
in 1980, and for breaking into a San Antonio home in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Passaic County, N.J., prosecutors opposed Ayala's bid for parole  
last year, and it was rejected. He was released after accumulating 
credits for good time partly because of his work as a jailhouse 
counselor. Prosecutor Ronald S. Fava did not return a telephone 
call seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Though out of prison, Ayala will forever be haunted by the awful  
pain inflicted on an innocent woman. 
</P>
<P>
	``He worked on himself as if he was a fighter in the ring,''  
said his friend and counselor, Brian Raditz. ``He was relentless. 
He fought through all the hurt, the insecurity, the vulnerability. 
And he got his answers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are still many questions. Even as he walked out of prison,  
Ayala was overcome by feelings that none of it was real. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kept expecting an officer to come to me and say they made a  
mistake,'' said Ayala, spending his first hours of freedom with his 
wife at Raditz's home in the Philadelphia suburb of Huntingdon 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	``He took a deep breath, let it out and said, `Let's go,''' Paez  
said. ``We walked through the doors hand-in-hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a new beginning. It was a very hard walk. But I've always  
been in love with Tony, and I was always trying to replace him with 
someone else. It just wasn't happening. I wasn't running from him, 
because I loved him. I was running from a situation that was just 
unbearable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paez struggled with her husband's crime and absence, leaving him  
several years ago. But she was there to lead him out of Bayside 
State Prison in Leesburg, N.J. The couple are planning to remarry 
and perhaps have children. 
</P>
<P>
	Ayala says he weighs 175 pounds -- 21 pounds over the junior  
middleweight limit -- and can do 300 pullups, 300 pushups, 300 dips, 
2,000 crunches and run eight miles. His father, also Tony, will 
train him again if he makes it back into the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Physically, he looks phenomenal,'' Raditz said. ``He's  
probably in better shape now than he was when he was fighting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Financially, Ayala needs to work. As with many troubled  
fighters, boxing probably will give him a few easy paydays. If he 
is going to make it, Ayala will have to avoid the problems former 
heavyweight champion Mike Tyson has had since he got out of prison 
for rape. 
</P>
<P>
	``Boxing is a way I could give to my family what I always wanted  
to give to them, but unfortunately was too stupid when I was young 
to give them,'' Ayala said. ``I want to finish some unfinished 
business with boxing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Ayala tended to the unfinished business of his life.  
Laughter, chatter and a dog's barking could be heard in the 
background as he talked on the phone. 
</P>
<P>
	The sounds of a speedbag could be next.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's already succeeded,'' Raditz said. ``He's dealt with his  
horrible, horrible conflicts. He's very remorseful about how he 
behaved. He is a winner already, whether he goes back to fighting 
or, honestly, whatever he sets his mind to.''

<HEADLINE>  Colo. School Checked for Booby Traps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Working around bodies still lying where  
they fell more than a day earlier, bomb squad officers checked 
lockers and backpacks for booby traps Wednesday as investigators 
tried to piece together one of the deadliest school massacres in 
U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurling bombs and blasting away with guns, two students in black  
trench coats killed 12 schoolmates and a teacher Tuesday at 
Columbine High School, most of them in the library. The gunmen, 
Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, then apparently killed 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials were trying to determine if others were involved, and  
they questioned the killers' parents and other members of the boys' 
dark group of outcasts, the ``Trenchcoat Mafia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parents waited for more than 24 hours after the attack until  
they finally received official word of their children's fate. Not 
until Wednesday afternoon were the first bodies removed from the 
scene. By 7 p.m., the other corpses all had been taken to the 
coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators had left the bodies in place for so long so they  
could check for explosives and record the details of the crime 
scene, which SWAT members described as something from ``Dante's 
Inferno.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many bodies were sprawled on the floor, slumped in desks or  
crouched beneath tables, boxes and cubicles where they apparently 
tried to hide. Police found a handgun under one of the killers, and 
a semiautomatic rifle and two sawed-off shotguns elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a different sort of chaos inside,'' SWAT Sgt. George  
Hinkle said. ``There were fire alarms going off, strobe lights, 
four inches of water in the cafeteria. We had been told there were 
bombs in backpacks and there were backpacks everywhere. It was the 
toughest tactical problem I've ever seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said 30 explosive devices had  
been found at Columbine, in the killers' vehicles and at their 
homes. Late Tuesday, more than 10 hours after the shootings, a time 
bomb blew up, but no one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of these devices are on timing devices, some are  
incendiary devices and some are pipe bombs,'' Sheriff John Stone 
told ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' ``Some are like hand grenades 
that have got shrapnel in them wrapped around butane containers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nine of the victims were male and four were female. District  
Attorney Dave Thomas said there was no evidence that the killers 
targeted minorities, as some students claimed. Only one of the 13 
victims was black. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've only seen the photographs, but it appears to me that most  
of the victims were victims because of where they were at a 
particular time, not that they were sought out,'' Thomas said. 
``Most of the victims were in the library, and that's where these

condition.

issued statements Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>

victims, their families, friends, and the entire community,'' the 
Klebold family said. ``Like the rest of the country, we are 
struggling to understand why this happened, and ask that you please

threatened to kill him, but later had resumed their friendship. 
Brown said he saw Harris carrying a duffel bag as he walked into 
the school on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was walking out for a cigarette and I told him, `Hey, man,'  
and he said, `Brooks, I like you. Now, get out of here. Go home.'''

<HEADLINE>  15 Dead in Colo. School Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Worried about bombs and booby traps,  
specially trained officers painstakingly checked thousands of 
lockers and castoff backpacks today in a suburban high school where 
15 people were killed in the deadliest U.S. school rampage on 
record. Close to 30 explosive devices were found. 
</P>
<P>
	Victims' bodies were left in the school overnight as agonized  
parents braced for the worst. Students streamed into Clement Park 
next to the school early today to leave flowers and share their 
feelings about the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helps to talk about it,'' said Brandon Reisbeck, a  
19-year-old senior who bolted from his choir class to safety after 
he heard gunshots Tuesday. Outside the Light of the World Church, 
visitors placed flowers and cards at the base of a weathered 
12-foot cross leaning sideways against a tree. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation was delayed by the thorough police sweep of  
the school, which was prompted by the discovery of bombs in the 
parking lot and on the bodies of the gunmen, said to be members of 
an outcast group with right-wing overtones called the Trenchcoat 
Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
	At midmorning today, sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said close  
to 30 explosive devices were found at the school, in the suspects' 
vehicles and possibly at their homes. Late Tuesday, more than 11 
hours after the shootings, a bomb on a timer blew up, but no one 
was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of these devices are on timing devices, some are  
incendiary devices and some are pipe bombs,'' Jefferson County 
Sheriff John Stone told ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' ``Some are 
like hand grenades that have got shrapnel in them wrapped around 
butane containers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After hours of confusion on the precise death toll, Davis put it  
at 15, including the two shooters. Four of the dead were women or 
girls, and at least one was believed to be a school staff member, 
he said. At one point, authorities had said up to 25 had died. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the victims were found underneath desks, in cubicles or  
in boxes, slain while apparently trying to hide, Davis said. 
Witnesses said that during the rampage, the two teen-agers in black 
trench coats laughed and hooted as they opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, students struggled to understand the tragedy.  
</P>
<P>
	Crystal Woodman, a junior who was in the library when the gunmen  
burst in, said this morning she can't get their voices out of her 
head. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were just, like, they thought it was funny,'' Woodman  
told ``Good Morning America.'' ``They were just, like `Who's next? 
Who's ready to die?' They were just, like, `We've waited to do this 
our whole lives.' And every time they'd shoot someone, they'd 
holler, like it was, like, exciting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the bodies were found in the library. The attackers  
marched in with guns and pipe bombs, demanding that ``all jocks 
stand up. We're going to kill every one of you,'' student Aaron 
Cohn said. 
</P>
<P>
	A gunman looked under a desk in the library and said  
``Peek-a-boo,'' then fired, Cohn said. Anyone who cried or moaned 
was shot again. One girl begged for her life, but a gunshot ended 
her cries. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohn said one killer put a pistol to his head but did not shoot  
him. Instead, he said, the shooter turned his attention to a black 
student, saying, ``I hate niggers.'' Cohn heard three shots but 
couldn't see what happened. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, frantic parents awaited word of their children,  
watching as busloads of tearful students were reunited with their 
families. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-three people were treated at hospitals, most of them with  
gunshot wounds. Sixteen teens remained hospitalized this morning, 
including five in critical condition and five others in serious 
condition. One teen suffered at least nine shrapnel and bullet 
wounds; she was in fair condition today. 
</P>
<P>
	Students and Denver media identified the gunmen as Eric Harris  
and Dylan Klebold. The two exchanged shots with police and were 
later found dead in the library with self-inflicted gunshot wounds 
and bombs around their bodies, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears to be a suicide mission,'' Stone said.  
</P>
<P>
	Both youths had two parents at home and came from families  
neighbors described as fine people. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were extremely bright, but not good students,'' said  
choir teacher Lee Andres. ``... They disliked authority. They did 
not like to be told what to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the motive was unclear, several students said Harris and

Mafia,'' outcasts who bragged about guns and bombs and hated blacks 
and Hispanics, as well as athletes.

	The pair, wearing fatigues and ankle-length black coats, opened  
fire in the parking lot around 11:30 a.m. before entering the

<P>
	Student Nick Foss saw one of the gunmen pull a sawed-off shotgun  
from under his coat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Finally I started figuring out these guys shot to kill for no  
reason,'' Foss said. The gunman ``didn't say anything. When he 
looked at me, the guy's eyes were just dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The killers fired as they walked into the cafeteria and  
continued shooting as they moved upstairs into the library. Cohn 
said he heard one girl begging for her life and then a bang.

whisper they were OK. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of police officers from throughout the Denver area  
surrounded the school, which has 1,800 students. As TV images of 
the scene were broadcast nationwide, helicopter ambulances used a 
sports field as a landing pad, and officers in helmets and 
camouflage gear took cover behind squad cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Students who fled the building wept and held their hands above  
their heads while police frisked them. 
</P>
<P>

will wake up to the dimensions of this challenge, if it could 
happen in a place like Littleton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At an appearance today in Minneapolis, Attorney General Janet  
Reno said she may push to have more counselors in the nation's 
schools to avoid problems before they start. ``It is important for 
teachers, parents ... to have the resources they need to turn to,'' 
Reno said.

farmland is rapidly disappearing beneath suburban sprawl and soccer 
fields.

questions from investigators, who were trying to identify some of 
the victims based only on what they were wearing.

	Since 1997, a series of school shootings around the country have  
led to demands for stricter laws, tighter security and closer 
monitoring of troubled students. Two people were killed in an 
attack in Pearl, Miss., three in West Paducah, Ky., five in 
Jonesboro, Ark., and two in Springfield, Ore.

<HEADLINE>  15 Dead in Colo. School Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Worried about bombs and booby traps,  
specially trained officers painstakingly checked thousands of 
lockers and castoff backpacks today in a suburban high school where 
15 people were killed in the deadliest U.S. school rampage on 
record. Close to 30 explosive devices were found. 
</P>
<P>
	Victims' bodies were left in the school overnight as agonized  
parents braced for the worst. Students streamed into Clement Park 
next to the school early today to leave flowers and share their 
feelings about the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helps to talk about it,'' said Brandon Reisbeck, a  
19-year-old senior who bolted from his choir class to safety after 
he heard gunshots Tuesday. Outside the Light of the World Church, 
visitors placed flowers and cards at the base of a weathered 
12-foot cross leaning sideways against a tree. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation was delayed by the thorough police sweep of  
the school, which was prompted by the discovery of bombs in the 
parking lot and on the bodies of the gunmen, said to be members of 
an outcast group with right-wing overtones called the Trenchcoat 
Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
	At midmorning today, sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said close  
to 30 explosive devices were found at the school, in the suspects' 
vehicles and possibly at their homes. Late Tuesday, more than 11 
hours after the shootings, a bomb on a timer blew up, but no one 
was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of these devices are on timing devices, some are  
incendiary devices and some are pipe bombs,'' Jefferson County 
Sheriff John Stone told ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' ``Some are 
like hand grenades that have got shrapnel in them wrapped around 
butane containers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After hours of confusion on the precise death toll, Davis put it  
at 15, including the two shooters. Four of the dead were women or 
girls, and at least one was believed to be a school staff member, 
he said. At one point, authorities had said up to 25 had died. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the victims were found underneath desks, in cubicles or  
in boxes, slain while apparently trying to hide, Davis said. 
Witnesses said that during the rampage, the two teen-agers in black 
trench coats laughed and hooted as they opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, students struggled to understand the tragedy.  
</P>
<P>
	Crystal Woodman, a junior who was in the library when the gunmen  
burst in, said this morning she can't get their voices out of her 
head. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were just, like, they thought it was funny,'' Woodman  
told ``Good Morning America.'' ``They were just, like `Who's next? 
Who's ready to die?' They were just, like, `We've waited to do this 
our whole lives.' And every time they'd shoot someone, they'd 
holler, like it was, like, exciting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the bodies were found in the library. The attackers  
marched in with guns and pipe bombs, demanding that ``all jocks 
stand up. We're going to kill every one of you,'' student Aaron 
Cohn said. 
</P>
<P>
	A gunman looked under a desk in the library and said  
``Peek-a-boo,'' then fired, Cohn said. Anyone who cried or moaned 
was shot again. One girl begged for her life, but a gunshot ended 
her cries. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohn said one killer put a pistol to his head but did not shoot  
him. Instead, he said, the shooter turned his attention to a black 
student, saying, ``I hate niggers.'' Cohn heard three shots but 
couldn't see what happened. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, frantic parents awaited word of their children,  
watching as busloads of tearful students were reunited with their 
families. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-three people were treated at hospitals, most of them with  
gunshot wounds. Sixteen teens remained hospitalized this morning, 
including five in critical condition and five others in serious 
condition. One teen suffered at least nine shrapnel and bullet 
wounds; she was in fair condition today. 
</P>
<P>
	Students and Denver media identified the gunmen as Eric Harris  
and Dylan Klebold. The two exchanged shots with police and were 
later found dead in the library with self-inflicted gunshot wounds 
and bombs around their bodies, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears to be a suicide mission,'' Stone said.  
</P>
<P>
	Both youths had two parents at home and came from families  
neighbors described as fine people. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were extremely bright, but not good students,'' said  
choir teacher Lee Andres. ``... They disliked authority. They did 
not like to be told what to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the motive was unclear, several students said Harris and  
Klebold were members of a group calling itself the ``Trenchcoat 
Mafia,'' outcasts who bragged about guns and bombs and hated blacks 
and Hispanics, as well as athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Police who searched Harris' home said they found bomb-making

<HEADLINE> Broadcasters Mull Digital Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Going digital offers broadcasters unprecedented  
opportunities: better pictures, extra channels and new services 
such as customized news or stock quotes delivered to TVs or 
personal computers. The trick is to figure out what viewers want 
and what will be profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcasters, who are just beginning to offer higher-quality  
digital television, are struggling to make these decisions. And 
that's the way federal regulators want it. They don't want to be 
picking digital TV winners and losers. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Bill Kennard  
has an idea about what might drive digital TV, and it's more than 
giving viewers pretty pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to be a lot about data. I think data is  
going to be the killer application for digital TV,'' Kennard told 
broadcasters attending their annual convention here. ``Just as the 
jet engine revolutionized air travel, I think that when the 
broadcast airwaves go digital, it's going to revolutionize 
television in this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The technology enables broadcasters, for example, to let people  
watching a favorite show click an icon on digital TV sets or PCs 
(that can receive digital television) and obtain information on the 
actors, writers and past episodes. 
</P>
<P>
	And, it offers new opportunities to make money. For instance, a  
viewer watching a music video could click on an on-screen icon and 
buy the CD. Stations would get a piece of the money from these 
sales, experts say. Or stations could share the revenues from ads 
that accompany online services. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Yang, co-founder of the Internet company Yahoo! Inc.,  
believes broadcasters and Internet companies can and should work 
together to create new information products that people can get 
from their computers or TV sets. 
</P>
<P>
	Some wonder whether in the future people watching an episode of  
NBC's ``Friends,'' for example, would be able to click on an 
on-screen icon and buy a dress like the one Monica is wearing in 
that episode. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Rogers, president of NBC Cable &AMP; Business Development, said  
that's something stations would probably try one day. 
</P>
<P>
	Yang said people might be turned off by ``crass commercialism''  
in their entertainment programming, but said it could work if done 
in a creative way that doesn't ruin the show. 
</P>
<P>
	``Broadcasters ... are well positioned to take advantage of the  
digital revolution as it continues to unfold,'' said former 
longtime CBS executive Howard Stringer, now chairman of Sony Corp. 
of America. ``Digital television will afford unprecedented 
opportunities to create new content, customize it and re-express it 
in new formats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC, working with Intel Corp., plans by the fall to give viewers  
who watch some digital versions of its Saturday morning teen shows 
the ability to participate in online chats and take interactive 
quizzes. But they'll need a digital TV set and a special set-top 
box or a PC that can receive digital television. 
</P>
<P>
	National Association of Broadcasters President Edward Fritts  
said stations are still feeling their way. ``The stations that will 
do best are those that are creative, that have ingenuity and are 
willing to push the edges of the envelope,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Digital technology lets broadcasters squeeze more video and data  
into existing channel space, giving them numerous options. They 
could use it to provide high definition TV, which offers sharper 
pictures then standard digital. They could offer additional TV 
channels for sports or movies, or stock quotes and other data 
transmitted to home computers. Or a combination. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC requires digital broadcasters to continue offering at  
least one free broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
	About 57 stations now offer digital broadcasts, mostly digital  
versions of the same programs they air in analog. More stations are 
to begin digital broadcasts May 1. By 2006, all stations must 
switch to the technology.

<HEADLINE> New Reds Owners Have Steered Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Cincinnati Reds' next controlling partner  
has already played a role in shaping the club. 
</P>
<P>
	Financier Carl Lindner called general manager Jim Bowden last  
year when he was considered for jobs in Los Angeles and Baltimore. 
Lindner made it clear he didn't want Bowden to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he felt I was one of the best general managers in the  
game and felt I should stay in Cincinnati,'' Bowden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindner got his wish. Bowden wound up getting a four-year  
contract extension last October that will keep him with the Reds 
through 2003, and will remain in place when Lindner takes over the 
team from Marge Schott. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott agreed Tuesday to sell 5 1/2 of her 6 1/2 shares -- including  
the general partner shares -- to Lindner and two other limited 
partners for $67 million. The deal is expected to get baseball's 
approval, perhaps as early as June. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously I'm pleased,'' Bowden said. ``Mr. Lindner was very  
influential in me staying here in Cincinnati. He got involved in 
the late stages last year and he was a major reason why I stayed 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lindner, who prefers to get things done behind the scenes, did  
not issue any statements or attend the Reds' game Tuesday night 
after the sale agreement was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	When he takes over the team, he's expected to keep John Allen in  
charge. Allen has been running the Reds since June 12, 1996, when 
Schott agreed to step aside as part of her latest punishment from 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen has consulted with Lindner and the other limited partners  
while he runs the team and negotiates a lease for a new ballpark 
expected to open in 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me personally, it's been a long road for the last two or  
three years,'' Allen said. ``It's been exciting and it's been 
challenging. I know Carl Lindner and I've worked closely with him 
for the past three or four years. It's very important for the fans 
to be aware of their interest in baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the most part, Lindner and the other limited partners have  
been in the public eye only when they've fought Schott. That 
started to change last year. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Reds reached a preliminary agreement with Hamilton  
County officials for a new ballpark, Lindner uncharacteristically 
showed up at the news conference and presented Schott with a 
memento. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindner, who often attends Reds games, quietly persuaded Schott  
to sell her shares rather than fighting the limited partners in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	George Strike and William Reik, the other limited partners who  
will buy Schott's shares along with Lindner, have been a little 
more visible. Both of them showed up to watch a workout at Cinergy 
Field the day before the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reik is probably the biggest fan,'' Allen said. ``He loves the  
game and is a student of the game. I've probably spent more time 
talking about players and what goes on on the field with him more 
than any of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lindner, who will replace Schott as the controlling partner,  
can't make any changes until baseball approves the deal. Knowing 
that he will keep Allen and Bowden in place eased any concerns 
about an upheaval when Schott leaves. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice that it's all taken care of,'' manager Jack McKeon  
said. ``Now it'll let us get on to business. We have our own 
problems to worry about, such as getting hitters out.''

<HEADLINE> Rioting in Jamaica Leaves Six Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) -- Jamaicans blocked major roads with  
burning barricades of tires and furniture on Wednesday, defying 
police who fired warning shots and tear gas. At least six people 
have been reported killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Violent protests have swept the Caribbean island since the  
government announced $100 million in new taxes on Friday. The 
unrest prompted several airlines and cruise ships to cancel trips 
to Jamaica on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The taxes include a 30 percent increase in gasoline prices. The  
last two governments to significantly raise gas prices fell, and 
there were deadly gas price riots in 1979 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kingston overnight, demonstrators set four shops ablaze and  
looters smashed other businesses, defying a new curfew that the 
government had imposed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The gas tax will be a joke compared to the money we are going  
to lose in tourism,'' resort owner Gordon Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters and opposition parties were unmoved by Prime Minister  
P.J. Patterson's appeals for calm and promises to appoint a team to 
help soften the blow. 
</P>
<P>
	The government argues the taxes are needed to help restore the  
lost money of some 2 million depositors in failed banks, 500,000 
policyholders in collapsed insurance companies and 55,000 
pensioners. 
</P>
<P>
	But National Democratic Movement president Bruce Golding said  
Patterson ``has obviously not heard the cries of the people'' and 
that his announcement ``is not going to quell the anger expressed 
out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Underscoring his claim, protesters were blocking most entrances  
to the capital by midday Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	At the main western entry to Kingston, protesters hurled rocks  
at cars that tried to get through burning barricades that blocked 
the four-lane highway. 
</P>
<P>
	``Go home!'' they yelled, hurling bottles onto the road to  
puncture car tires. 
</P>
<P>
	Police at the scene fired submachine guns and shotguns into the  
air, briefly frightening away protesters. 
</P>
<P>
	The first fatality of the protests was identified as Brenda  
Duncan, a 28-year-old pregnant woman who police said was shot 
Tuesday by a private security guard fending off looters. 
</P>
<P>
	A soldier was also killed during a clash with protesters,  
apparently shot by police. 
</P>
<P>
	Four other people died of gunshot wounds at Kingston Public  
Hospital, according hospital official Carlene Nugent. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the hospital had admitted 23 people in that time, most  
with gunshot wounds and some in critical condition Wednesday, 
including a police officer who was shot in the face Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Police on Wednesday said a 71-year-old woman died after  
collapsing during protests Monday in the northwest resort of 
Montego Bay.

<HEADLINE> IMF Head Supports U.S. Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund, meeting next  
week, likely will approve a key part of a U.S. plan to deal with 
the global currency crisis, the head of the IMF said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said the IMF is likely to reach agreement with Russia on  
economic reforms that will clear the way for badly needed loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Clinton administration, anxious to maintain  
momentum in trying to overhaul the global financial system and make 
it better withstand future crises, offered proposals to get the 
private sector more involved in rescue efforts for countries in 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus voiced support for a  
proposal President Clinton first put forward last fall at the 
height of the crisis. The administration wants the IMF to make 
available new pre-approved lines of credit for countries pursuing 
sound policies to help them fend off financial turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	While there had been speculation Mexico might be the first  
nation to receive such a credit line, Camdessus said it was too 
early to say when the resource might be used. But he said he 
believed questions about the proposal were close to being resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Camdessus said pre-emptive use of IMF resources could end up  
saving the agency money in the long run by averting the need for 
huge bailout programs once a country's currency and economy are 
devastated by a loss of investor confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``A less costly way to address these risks is to strengthen the  
strong to give them the assurances that they will find the needed 
support to resist contagion,'' Camdessus said, predicting the 
agency would be able to soon work out details on how countries 
would qualify for the new credit line. 
</P>
<P>
	Camdessus called Russia ``the most difficult problem we must  
tackle,'' referring to that country's serious economic problems 
since it threw the global economy into a tailspin last August by 
defaulting on billions of dollars in foreign debt. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said IMF officials have reported more hopeful signs in  
recent days in negotiations with Russia over restarting IMF loans 
and he predicted an agreement could be reached ``in the next few 
days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a separate appearance, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said  
the United States would use next week's meetings of finance 
officials of the world's seven richest countries and the annual 
spring meetings of the 182-nation IMF to make sure that President 
Clinton's reform agenda continues to move forward. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rubin said the likely outcome will be incremental progress  
not any dramatic breakthroughs. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no simple answers or magic wands,'' Rubin told an  
audience at Johns Hopkins University's foreign policy school. 
``Reform is not going to involve a single dramatic announcement, 
but a collection of actions over time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said ways must be found to make sure private investors  
bear more of the burden of rescue efforts when countries get into 
trouble. He said developing countries should also be discouraged 
from relying too heavily on short-term loans that often promote 
capital flight when investors suddenly lose confidence in a 
particular country. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said he would also advance at next week's discussion ideas  
on providing debt relief for the world's poorest countries. The 
administration has indicated it supports a plan to sell off a 
portion of the IMF's huge gold reserves to finance such an effort. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration is hoping international backing for its  
efforts to deal with the global financial crisis will deflect 
domestic criticism that it is not doing enough to deal with a 
soaring U.S. trade deficit, the result of lost export opportunities 
for American manufacturers and farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republican presidential candidate Pat Buchanan, in an  
appearance in Los Angeles, attacked the administration's failed 
trade policies, calling the $26 billion deficit in merchandise 
trade in February ``a malignant tumor in the intestines of the U.S. 
economy.''

<HEADLINE> 2 Killed in Brazil Soccer Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Soccer fans in Brazil shot four youths  
wearing rival team colors while they waited at a bus stop, killing 
two and seriously injuring the other two, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two supporters of the Sao Paulo soccer team, aged 17 and 26,  
died after the Wednesday shooting by two youths wearing Corinthians 
soccer team shirts, said police spokesman Anacleto Franco. 
</P>
<P>
	Two more fans, aged 17 and 22, were being treated for serious  
gunshot wounds, Franco added. The two gunmen escaped. 
</P>
<P>
	TV Globo reported that the Corinthians fans got out of a van and  
started shooting at the four when they refused to take off their 
team shirts. 
</P>
<P>
	The shootings happened in the Sao Paulo suburb of Diadema soon  
after separate matches involving the clubs kicked off, said Franco. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fighting involving soccer fans happens frequently, but for  
fans to use guns is uncommon,'' Franco said. He said it was not 
clear if the fans were traveling to the matches. 
</P>
<P>
	Sao Paulo faced another local team, Portugesa, while Corinthians  
played Bolivia's Wilstermann in the Libertadores Cup.

<HEADLINE> Drop in One Solvent Helping Ozone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The level of ozone-depleting chemicals in the atmosphere is  
falling, mostly because of reductions in one solvent, meaning 
further cuts can occur only if emissions of other chemicals are 
lowered, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have made progress, but we're not out of the woods yet,''  
said Stephen A. Montzka of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers monitored levels of the chemicals at remote  
locations worldwide between 1992 and 1997. Levels were found to 
have declined about 3 percent. The findings were published in 
Thursday's issue of the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Production of a solvent called methyl chloroform was phased out  
between 1993 and 1996. Levels of the chemical have dropped almost 
in half since then because of production cuts and the substance's 
five-year lifespan in the atmosphere, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	That decrease accounted for so much of the drop in  
ozone-depleting chemicals that if methyl chloroform were ignored, 
the overall level would have been increasing in 1997, the 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other chemicals such as CFC-12, a refrigerant, and CFC-11, used  
to make foam, are still present at more than twice the peak levels 
of methyl chloroform. Although CFCs are regulated, CFC-12 levels 
actually rose, while CFC-11 declined slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, atmospheric levels of one firefighting chemical,  
H-1211, continued to increase despite the availability of 
alternatives. H-1211 is particularly troubling because it contains 
bromine, a potent ozone destroyer. 
</P>
<P>
	The ozone layer protects the Earth from excessive ultraviolet  
light, which has been linked to skin cancer. Ozone depletion has 
been the most severe over the Antarctic, where an ``ozone hole'' 
appears periodically. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1989, 165 nations signed the Montreal Protocol, an agreement  
to reduce levels of ozone-damaging chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	The quick gains in reducing methyl chloroform, are not expected  
to be repeated with the CFCs. The two chemicals are still allowed 
to be made in developing countries on a limited basis until 2010. 
And once released, they spend a long time in the atmosphere-- 100 
years for CFC-12 and 45 years for CFC-11. In addition, CFC-11 and 
CFC-12 continue to be released from junked air conditioners, foam 
and other products. 
</P>
<P>
	Ozone depletion can be halted in the next decade, Paul J.  
Fraser, of CSIRO Atmospheric Research in Victoria, Australia, and 
Michael J. Prather of the University of California at Irvine wrote 
in an accompanying commentary. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it will require a new level of global stewardship that  
still poses a substantial challenge to all parties to the Montreal 
Protocol,'' they said.

<HEADLINE> Bombs Fall, Milosevic Still Stands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Ambassador Richard Holbrooke walked out  
of his final negotiation with Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic, the Serb leader turned to the American envoy and asked, 
``Will I ever see you again?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's up to you, Mr. President,'' Holbrooke replied.  
</P>
<P>
	The next night, NATO began dropping precision-guided bombs on  
Yugoslavia, a campaign designed to get Milosevic ``to change his 
mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the four-week mark, the Yugoslav leader continues to defy  
Clinton administration expectations. Emboldened by NATO's decision 
not to use ground trips, Milosevic has stepped up the killing of 
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo even as the bombardment has intensified. 
</P>
<P>
	The attacks have even encouraged Serbs to rally around their  
leader, strengthening his hold on power. 
</P>
<P>
	Military and foreign policy experts say the administration  
miscalculated Milosevic's determination to withstand punishing 
airstrikes to retain control of the rebel Kosovo province. In so 
doing, NATO left the province's ethnic Albanians unprotected from 
the massacres that ensued. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until you begin to assemble any ground force, Milosevic  
doesn't need to worry. He knows by now what the air campaign can 
do,'' said Anthony Cordesman, a military analyst with the Center 
for Strategic and International Studies. 
</P>
<P>
	At a Senate hearing last week, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,  
pressed Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
about the decision to rule out ground troops. 
</P>
<P>
	``How does it make sense, Gen. Shelton, to remove an option, to  
tell your enemy before you go into a conflict that you will not 
exercise whatever options are necessary?'' McCain asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no argument,'' Shelton replied.  
</P>
<P>
	Morton Abramowitz, an undersecretary of state during the Bush  
administration, said the Clinton administration may have based its 
calculation on the last time NATO used air power in the Balkans. In 
1995, air attacks and Croatian ground action forced Milosevic and 
Bosnian-Serbs to the negotiating table. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, though, there were no ground troops, and Milosevic  
made clear he cared more about Kosovo than Bosnia. ``Obviously, the 
strategy did not work in terms of getting him to back down,'' 
Abramowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The flaw in the strategy is they didn't protect the  
Kosovars,'' Abramowitz added. ``They left them terribly exposed and 
you can see the results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were some warnings before the bombing began.  
</P>
<P>
	CIA Director George Tenet told lawmakers in February that Kosovo  
was a ``tinderbox'' and that Yugoslavia would seek to ``crush the 
Kosovo Liberation Army once and for all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tenet privately advised that airstrikes alone probably would not  
sway Milosevic, senior administration officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem with sending troops, Shelton told lawmakers last  
week, was that the 19 NATO countries weren't prepared to back a 
ground invasion of Yugoslavia. ``It was a NATO decision to only 
have an air option,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and other U.S. officials now say they always  
understood the risk that Milosevic might hunker down. But in the 
first days of the attacks, U.S. officials suggested Milosevic might 
capitulate quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	The night before the airstrikes began, Secretary of State  
Madeleine Albright predicted the campaign ``is not something that 
is going to go on for an overly long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now Albright says, ``The air campaign will go on as long as is  
necessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There have been other adjustments in public statements by the  
United States and NATO: 
</P>
<P>
	--On March 19, Clinton said, ``Action and resolve can stop  
armies, and save lives.'' This week, Air Force Maj. Gen. Charles 
Wald told reporters, ``I don't think anybody said air (power) can 
do everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--The airstrikes were designed to force Milosevic to resume  
negotiations. This week, Albright said, ``It is harder and harder 
to imagine that the United States could negotiate with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One by one, the original administration goals have either been  
thwarted or grown more remote: stopping a humanitarian disaster; 
bringing Milosevic to the negotiating table; returning Kosovars to 
their homes; increasing internal political pressure on Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration now argues that it simply had to act.  
</P>
<P>
	``There was only one possibility that we and our NATO allies  
were not willing to entertain,'' Clinton told newspaper editors 
last week, ``that the international community would look the other 
way in the face of this brutality.''

<HEADLINE>  US Apache Helicopters Reach Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TIRANA, Albania (AP) -- Six low-flying but potent U.S. Apache  
helicopter gunships arrived in Albania on Wednesday, increasing the 
firepower available to NATO commanders in the Yugoslav conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Deployment of the Apaches, however, heightens the risk of  
American casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of what makes the black helicopter gunships so feared is  
their ability to fly just a few feet off the ground, swooping over 
Kosovo's hilly terrain and into valleys. But that also makes them 
easier targets for Serb anti-aircraft guns. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Army Capt. Mark Arden, in Albania preparing for the full  
unit's arrival from Italy, said: ``We're taking all precautions 
possible to minimize those risks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, he added, ``the risks to the Serbs, I would say, are  
great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least 24 of the anti-tank helicopters are expected to be  
deployed eventually. They will intensify NATO's campaign against 
the Yugoslav army and special police units accused of driving 
hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians out of neighboring Kosovo 
province in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Arden said many of the Apache pilots are Persian Gulf War  
veterans, and he described their unit as ``the tip of the spear of 
the entire U.S. military.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO decided to send in the helicopters early in its four-week  
air campaign against Yugoslavia. But logistical problems, and more 
recently bad weather in Albania, delayed their deployment. 
</P>
<P>
	There also were complications in assembling ground troops and  
support units for the Apaches, including a battalion of 
multiple-launch rocket systems to provide protection against Serb 
air defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes about 14 people on the ground to get one of the  
Apaches in the air,'' said Lt. Col. Vance Sales, commander of the 
229th Attack Helicopter Regiment at Fort Bragg, N.C. ``It is much 
more involved than a couple of pilots hopping in and taking off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO says the Apaches could be sent into Kosovo by next week.  
</P>
<P>
	Apaches are large and regarded as one of the most effective  
anti-tank weapons. Flown with a crew of two, they are armed with as 
many as 16 Hellfire missiles designed to knock out tanks and other 
armor. In addition, they have 70 mm rockets and a 30 mm cannon that 
can fire 625 rounds per minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Their introduction creates a new element in the conflict because  
the Apaches are slower and bigger targets than the high-flying, 
faster aircraft that NATO has used since its airstrikes began March 
24. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has lost one plane during the air campaign: an F-117A  
stealth fighter that crashed March 27. The pilot was rescued. Three 
U.S. soldiers also were captured near the Macedonian-Yugoslav 
border and remain in Serb custody.

<HEADLINE> Sunbeam Spreads Blame for Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DELRAY BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Sunbeam Corp., the embattled appliance  
maker that last year admitted to overstating its profits, lost $311 
million in the first three months of the year, hit hard by 
declining sales, shareholder lawsuits and payments to fired 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delray Beach, Fla.-based company said it would delay  
indefinitely its annual shareholders meeting while it answers 
questions about its financial reports from the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding special charges, Sunbeam lost $300 million, or $2.98  
per share, in its fourth quarter ended March 31. Including one-time 
expenses such as settling lawsuits, the company lost $311 million, 
or $3.11 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	The one-time charges included costs related to excessive  
inventory, defending shareholder and related lawsuits, the 
revamping of the company's historic financial records and severance 
pay to former Chairman Al Dunlap and other executives. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest results compare with a profit of $9.5 million profit,  
or 11 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding sales from newly acquired companies, revenues dropped  
15 percent in the fourth quarter to $223 million from $292 million 
a year ago. With the new companies, sales increased to $515 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	For its full fiscal year, Sunbeam lost $898 million, which  
compares with a $38 million profit in the prior 12-month period. 
Excluding the sales of newly purchased companies, 1998 sales 
dropped 23 percent to $828 million from $1.1 billion in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunlap was ousted in June after failing to boost Sunbeam's  
flagging shares even after big job cuts. Internal auditors later 
said the company overstated its loss for 1996, overstated profits 
for 1997 and understated the loss for the first quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts have said Sunbeam's new team is taking the right steps  
to rehabilitate the company, which is not expected to turn a profit 
until next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Sunbeam fell 6 cents to $5.50 on the New York Stock  
Exchange.

<HEADLINE> After Shooting Many Wonder Why </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The tragedy unfolded in images that have become eerily familiar,  
panicked groups running for cover, sobbing teens telling how they 
dodged the bullets, distraught parents clutching at each other for 
comfort. 
</P>
<P>
	Underneath, a question as chilling as the scenes of televised  
misery: Why are America's schools turning into killing fields? 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody who has children, anybody who doesn't have children  
should be frightened about what this bodes in a society where we 
have so many things and so much, and yet we can create monsters 
that can go in and shoot 25 peers,'' said Dr. Gery LeGagnoux, a 
UCLA teacher and psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
	In Oct. 1997, when a 16-year-old boy in Pearl, Miss., was  
accused of killing his mother and shooting nine students, two 
fatally, at his high school, the killings were a stunning anomaly. 
</P>
<P>
	By Tuesday, when two trench-coated young men swept through their  
suburban Denver high school killing up to 25 people before turning 
their guns on themselves, the phenomenon of students killing 
students seemed far less abnormal. 
</P>
<P>
	Springfield, Ore., Jonesboro, Ark., West Paducah, Ky. -- five  
school shootings in just the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts don't have one answer for what is behind the shootings;  
they have a lot of them. Lack of supervision, accessible guns, 
permissive or absent parents, school officials who fail to act on 
warning signs, a culture redolent with violence -- all are cited as 
contributing factors. 
</P>
<P>
	``These kids have never learned how to solve problems. They have  
an instant answer, and that's a gun,'' says Bill Reisman, a 
criminologist who has advised officials from several school 
districts that were the sites of earlier shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Increasingly, the shootings are suicide missions, as was the  
apparent case Tuesday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of them believe that death is now the solution and in  
order to get the maximum amount of attention they do these bizarre, 
heinous crime,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Violent movies and music can add ``fuel to a fire,'' but Reisman  
argues ``we can't blame things. People are responsible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Underpinning those problems is a society in which family and  
community ties are unraveling. 
</P>
<P>
	``It used to be when I was a kid, if I did something wrong down  
the street, before I got home that neighbor would have called my 
parents,'' Reisman said. ``These days they're afraid they're going 
to get sued.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Blauvelt, president of the National Alliance for Safe  
Schools, a consulting firm, said it's nearly impossible to find 
immediate answers to a tragedy like the Denver shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think one of the things we are suffering from is trying to  
rationalize what was really an irrational act,'' Blauvelt said. 
``This is a huge tragedy with a tremendous amount of ramifications 
in the United States, and the whole world for that matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Blauvelt said there are steps that can be taken, such as  
keeping a closer eye on class misbehavior -- and listening to 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest shootings, students said the gunmen apparently  
belonged to a clique of outcasts who wore long black trench coats, 
boasted of owning guns and disliked blacks, Hispanics and athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``My guess is that there was conversation between and among kids  
about what was going to happen. And no one listened to it,'' 
Blauvelt said.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reisman had the same advice for school officials: pay attention.  
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to have a lot more,'' Reisman said. ``I was  
involved in Pearl. Every time, this has escalated, the kids have 
learned from the previous one.''

<HEADLINE> US Navy Ready for Any Blockade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. Navy could, in a matter of hours,  
block petroleum from reaching Yugoslav ports, the commander of the 
Atlantic fleet told lawmakers Wednesday. The Clinton administration 
said it would press for NATO agreement on a naval blockade or oil 
embargo to stop fuel flowing to Serb forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the allies find  
themselves in a ``paradoxical situation'': NATO is bombing oil 
refineries and supplies throughout Yugoslavia, but is not using the 
many allied ships in the Adriatric Sea to block shipments of 
petroleum products. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is not any disagreement on the need to take more  
effective action, but (NATO leaders) have not yet come to a 
decision as to how to do that,'' Albright said in testimony to the 
House International Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	She said a possible naval blockade and international oil embargo  
would be discussed at NATO's 50th anniversary summit, which begins 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Adm. J.P. Reason, commander-in-chief of the U.S. Atlantic fleet,  
said there are enough allied naval forces in the Adriatic to impose 
a blockade ``in short order,'' perhaps in hours. 
</P>
<P>
	In the event of a naval blockade, the Serb military likely would  
use more land routes to transport oil and fuel, he said at a 
hearing Wednesday of the Senate Armed Services subcommittee on 
military readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes more than a naval blockade if you want to stop the  
flow of petroleum products,'' Reason said. ``You will find people 
carrying it in 5-gallon drums if they find that's what must be 
done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Navy official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
a naval blockade would severely restrict petroleum supplies to 
Yugoslavia because the Serbs now are getting most of fuel and oil 
shipments through ports. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO airstrikes, which began March 24, have destroyed 100  
percent of Yugoslavia's oil refining capability, the Pentagon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied attacks have destroyed oil and fuel depots as well as  
rail lines, bridges and roads used to resupply Serb forces fighting 
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, a Serbian province. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the Serb military remains able to fight and operate  
tanks and armored cars, helped by hidden supplies, military 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	In a blockade, Reason said:  
</P>
<P>
	-- The Navy simply could block sea lanes to Yugoslavia and  
possibly to neighboring countries. 
</P>
<P>
	-- U.S. military officers might board ships, including those from  
Russia. Special U.S. units would need a few days of training before 
handling these duties. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The U.S. military could mine harbors around Yugoslavia.  
</P>
<P>
	-- NATO airstrikes could begin to target Yugoslav ports.  
</P>
<P>
	Both Reason and Adm. Archie Clemins, commander-in-chief of the  
Pacific fleet, said they were concerned U.S. military resources 
have been ``stretched thin'' by NATO's airstrikes and the continued 
involvement with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the United States does not have an aircraft carrier  
in the Pacific and might not until the fall. The USS Kitty Hawk had 
been assigned to the Pacific but was ordered to the Gulf on April 3 
so the USS Theodore Roosevelt to join NATO's campaign. The 
Roosevelt arrived April 5 in the Adriatic. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon is considering sending a second carrier to help  
meet a NATO request for 300 more U.S. warplanes. The USS Enterprise 
and its 75 aircraft, which reached the Mediterranean on Tuesday 
after a six-month Gulf deployment, could go to the Aegean Sea 
instead of returning home, U.S. defense officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reason told lawmakers he also is worried about not replacing  
Tomahawk cruise missiles used against Yugoslavia. The Navy had 
about 1,000 of the $1 million weapons before the conflict began. He 
did not say how many have been used. 
</P>
<P>
	``All fleet units are still today fit to fight ... but I would  
be more comfortable with a few more arrows in my quiver,'' Reason 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	If another military crisis arose now, Reason said the Navy would  
feel the pinch. ``If we have some other flare-up in the world, then 
we're a little short,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Congress Approves Education Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress approved its first substantive  
legislation of the year Wednesday, a measure that would give states 
more freedom in how they spend federal education dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The House approved the ``Ed-Flex'' bill 368-57, and the Senate  
98-1, with many lawmakers saying the shootings at a Denver area 
high school Tuesday further justified the need to work for better 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said he would sign it ``without delay.''  
</P>
<P>
	``I am particularly pleased that the conference report  
strengthens accountability measures and preserves our effort to 
reduce class size in the early grades,'' Clinton said in a 
statement released by the White House. ``The bipartisan work on 
this legislation shows we can and must work together to improve our 
nation's schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, eager to show their commitment to education and  
other post-impeachment legislative priorities, hailed the bill's 
passage. To enhance the measure's chances, GOP leaders had to give 
up a major provision that exposed it to a presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would enable states and school districts to be released  
from some rules that ordinarily must be met to obtain federal 
funding. In exchange, they would have to set up their own programs 
under which they would be accountable for better educational 
results. 
</P>
<P>
	It would expand to all 50 states and the District of Columbia a  
demonstration program set up in 1994 that was limited to 12 states. 
</P>
<P>
	This Congress has passed a Republican budget outline for the  
coming fiscal year, but this would be the first major piece of 
legislation to go to Clinton for his signature. 
</P>
<P>
	While taking only a small step toward the Republican goal of  
returning more education money and responsibility to states and 
local school districts, GOP leaders praised the House action. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the last two years we had the most effective education  
effort in the history of the Congress of the United States,'' said 
Rep. William Goodling, R-Pa., chairman of the House Education and 
Workforce Committee. He cited this bill and legislation on 
vocational training, Head Start, charter schools and child 
nutrition, among others. 
</P>
<P>
	To avoid a presidential veto, a House-Senate conference  
abandoned a provision promoted by Senate Majority Leader Trent 
Lott, R-Miss., that Democrats said would undermine Clinton's drive 
to hire 100,000 new teachers to reduce class sizes. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott's measure would have let schools take some of the $1.2  
billion allocated for this year to hire some of the 100,000 
teachers and spend it instead on special education needs. In place 
of that, the bill says small districts with class sizes of 18 or 
fewer students may join with other districts to use the money for 
teacher training. 
</P>
<P>
	To participate in the Ed-Flex program under the bill, states  
would have to apply to the Education secretary for a waiver from 
the normal rules, explaining what educational goals would be 
achieved and how progress toward those goals would be evaluated. 
The waiver could be revoked after three years if the secretary 
concludes the state is not meeting its objectives. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe it will provide schools and their students with the  
tools to improve academic achievement,'' said Rep. Michael Castle, 
R-Del., who co-sponsored the bill with Rep. Tim Roemer, D-Ind. ``It 
allows local schools and districts to think outside the box.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some Democrats said they opposed the trend of reducing the  
federal role in improving performance in public schools, 
particularly in poorer school districts. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., the only senator to vote against  
the bill, said Congress was abandoning ``a value which says that we 
as a nation have certain core commitments and beliefs and one of 
them is that we are going to be sure that there is protection and 
some commitment to poor children in America.'' Sen. Tom Harkin, 
D-Iowa, did not vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Education Committee's ranking Democrat, Rep. William  
Clay of Missouri, said it opened ``unprecedented loopholes for 
states and school districts to avoid their obligations to serve 
poor school children first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., pointed to the school shooting  
outside Denver as indicative of the ``tremendous social problems'' 
that schools face and the need to give them the flexibility to deal 
with them. ``We in Washington shouldn't tell them how to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 800.

<HEADLINE> Congress Reacts to School Shootings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers reacted Wednesday to the Colorado  
shootings by dusting off stalled proposals for improved school 
security and urging passage of tougher gun control laws. Some 
members of Congress are seeking a ``national dialogue'' on school 
violence and asking for more prayer in schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should not wait for another incident to happen before we  
take some action,'' said Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	He is sponsoring a bill that would set aside $10 million so  
schools could benefit from security measures developed at the 
Energy Department's Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico. 
Examples include electronic identification cards for students, 
instant drug detection equipment and mechanisms to prevent false 
fire alarms. 
</P>
<P>
	Bingaman said an Albuquerque, N.M., high school participating in  
a pilot project with the lab has seen dramatic declines in violent, 
property and other crimes since 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen people were killed Tuesday in the shootings at a high  
school in the Denver suburb of Littleton. 
</P>
<P>
	The killings prompted gun control advocates to renew calls for  
stricter gun laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``A teen-ager can only do so much damage with his fists,'' said  
Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., the National Rifle Association's chief  
advocate in Congress, said the problems that create ``young 
demons'' like the Colorado shooters ``go far deeper'' than access 
to guns. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Congress and the president only can do so much. ``The  
solution's going to have to come from our schools,'' Barr said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Czwartacki, spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent  
Lott, R-Miss., noted Congress had set aside $60 million last year 
for a program to station police officers in schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jim Jeffords, R-Vt., chairman of the Health, Education,  
Labor and Pensions Committee, plans to go ahead with school safety 
hearings that already had been scheduled for May. 
</P>
<P>
	One colleague, GOP Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri, said Congress  
must re-examine federal laws that interfere with a school's ability 
to prevent such incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Another lawmaker, Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., urged  
consideration of her proposal encouraging states to detain 
juveniles for at least 24 hours for bringing guns to school. 
</P>
<P>
	But she, too, said a solution to the deadly combination of  
schools, students and guns lies not with Congress. Parents must be 
more involved with their children, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to talk to our children after they get home from  
school every night, at the dinner table, on weekends to find out 
what they're thinking, what they're feeling,'' Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others called for a national discussion of school violence.  
</P>
<P>
	``We need to sit down together, and soon, to begin a meaningful  
conversation about the practical and concrete steps to be taken to 
prevent these tragedies,'' said Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of 
Oregon, where a 16-year-old is accused of killing his parents and 
fatally shooting two classmates at a high school in Springfield 
last May. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Rep. Tim Roemer, D-Ind.: ``Let us have and engage in a  
national dialogue to stop this hatred and violence in our 
schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From Rep. James Traficant Jr., D-Ohio, came a call for more  
prayer in school. ``People who pray together are not likely ... to 
kill one another,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, the shootings at Columbine High School led two  
Colorado state lawmakers to withdraw gun proposals from the current 
legislative calendar. 
</P>
<P>
	One measure, by Republican state Rep. Gary McPherson, would let  
state law override local ordinances on gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	McPherson said he acted ``out of deference to the victims and  
their families. Now is not the time to have this debate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado House's majority leader, GOP state Rep. Doug Dean,  
was sponsoring a bill to simplify the issuance of permits for 
concealed weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Dean reported receiving calls at his Colorado Springs home, some  
of them with ``veiled threats,'' after the Littleton shootings.

<HEADLINE> Review Estate Plan if You Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Americans are a people on the move, and retirees  
are no exception. 
</P>
<P>
	Four in ten people reported they expect to move to another  
region of the country when they retire, according to a 1998 
Business Week/Louis Harris poll. 
</P>
<P>
	But amidst packing, waving goodbye to old friends and meeting  
new ones, and making the adjustments of living in a new state, it's 
easy to overlook an important financial step: reviewing and 
possibly altering your estate plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to see an attorney in the state you move to as  
soon as possible,'' says E.G. McBroom, an estate planning expert at 
the College for Financial Planning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Generally property rights and the legal interpretation of  
documents are matters of state law. Even if you have documents with 
identical language in two different states, the language might be 
interpreted differently by the courts in each state. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your estate planning documents and estate plan may be fine in  
the state where you currently live but may be deficient under the 
laws of the state you move to, especially if there is some kind of 
challenge. Or the laws of the state you move to may provide an 
opportunity to create an estate plan that is more favorable than 
your current plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	These issues can involve something as basic as a will, according  
to McBroom. For example, most states are what are called common-law 
states. They generally have statutes that protect the rights of 
spouses and dependent children. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, although you might write a will that gives  
everything to your brother and nothing to your spouse, common-law 
states generally require that at least a portion of the estate go 
to your spouse upon your death. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, McBroom emphasizes, many of the community  
property states (California is an exception) don't require that a 
portion of the property owned by the deceased go to a spouse or 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	A review of how your assets are titled and how that titling  
might be affected under the laws of another state is another 
important area, McBroom stresses. 
</P>
<P>
	The state where you live now may dictate that co-owned property,  
if that co-ownership is not clearly spelled out, will be treated as 
joint ownership with right of survival. The property automatically 
goes to the co-owner and avoids probate. 
</P>
<P>
	But the state where you move to may say that if the ownership is  
not spelled out, then it will be treated as tenancy in common. 
McBroom says that, under this form of ownership, the property would 
be distributed according to the provisions of the will or, if you 
don't have a will, according to the dictates of the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, a state may or may not recognize tenancy by the entirety,  
a form of co-ownership available only to married couples that 
severely restricts the individual rights of each spouse during 
lifetime and at death. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't just think of your personal property or your home in this  
regard. Also review how you have registered (titled) any 
investments securities such as individual stocks and bonds, or 
mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, McBroom recommends reviewing documents such as a  
durable power of attorney, living will and health care proxy. Here 
again, you want to see if moving to a new state potentially 
diminishes the effectiveness of documents you have drafted in 
another state, or if there are new opportunities you might take 
advantage of. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, a problem with durable powers of attorney, which is  
a document that legally authorizes someone to act on the behalf of 
someone else, is that sometimes it isn't recognized by third 
parties such as banks or title companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Some states have passed laws requiring the acceptance of the  
documents by third parties. Moving to a state that has such a law 
will mean a stronger power of attorney for you; moving into a state 
that doesn't require such a statute may create problems for you. 
</P>
<P>
	``The safest way to make sure you have something that won't  
cause problems is to make sure you're in compliance with the 
statutes in your new state,'' McBroom says. 
</P>
<P>
	Moving also can create problems if you own property in one state  
and move to another state while continuing to own the old property. 
Then you have the cost and hassle of probate in more than one 
state, unless you've implemented a strategy to have the property 
bypass probate, McBroom says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having an attorney review your documents, inform you of  
relevant changes, and make any necessary revisions can save a lot 
of headaches,'' he says.

<HEADLINE> Mantle Home Run Ball May Be Fake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- It might be the ball that Mickey Mantle hit out  
of the park for his 500th home run. Mantle's widow, however, says 
the ball is a fake. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a lot of money riding on the outcome.  
</P>
<P>
	The baseball in question was about to be auctioned last January  
at Guernsey's auction house in New York. Just minutes before, Mark 
McGwire's record-setting 70th home run ball from last season sold 
for $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Appraisers in the room believed the momentum that started with  
the sale of McGwire's ball could help push the price of the Mantle 
ball as high as $250,000, the Texas Journal of the Wall Street 
Journal reported in Wednesday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the telephone at Guernsey's rang.  
</P>
<P>
	It was Merlyn Mantle, the Yankee great's widow, who told the  
auctioneer that the ball on the block was a phony; that she had the 
real 500th homer souvenir in her Dallas home. 
</P>
<P>
	Guernsey's officials pulled the ball off the auction. Ever  
since, its owner, Dale Cicero, a firefighter from Bend, Ore., has 
been crusading to convince collectors he's got the genuine article. 
And he is hinting at suing Mrs. Mantle for interfering with the 
auction. 
</P>
<P>
	Cicero and Mrs. Mantle agree that the slugger turned over the  
500th homer ball to close friend and onetime business partner 
Harold Youngman of Baxter Springs, Kan., shortly after the fan who 
caught the ball returned it to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Mantle said her husband later took the ball back and gave  
it to her. But Cicero said Youngman, who died in 1990, gave the 
ball to a baseball museum, which displayed it with other Mantle 
memorabilia. He said he bought it three years ago -- for $24,200 -- 
from the collector who bought it from the museum in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Mantle said she plans to put her ball in a museum she's  
helping build near Grove, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really resent having to prove I've got the ball. I was  
married to Mick for 43 years,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But some sports memorabilia authenticators and friends of Mantle  
and Youngman think Cicero has the real ball, the Journal reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Heffner, president of Leland's Auctions, a sports  
memorabilia auction house in New York, has studied photographs of 
the balls and traced the ownership of Cicero's ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's only one conclusion to draw, and that is that he has  
the ball,'' Heffner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Mantle's ball doesn't have the American League's official  
stamp or a date. Mrs. Mantle admitted as much but said she'll let 
authentication experts examine the ball -- something Cicero has been 
pushing for. 
</P>
<P>
	Memorabilia experts also said the bold Mantle signature across  
the center of her ball is written in a style he didn't use until 
the 1980s. Mrs. Mantle said Mickey re-signed the ball in the 1980s, 
tracing over the faded, original signature. 
</P>
<P>
	Cicero's official American League ball is dated May 14, 1967,  
and bears a signature that experts said matches other items Mantle 
signed in the 1960s, the Journal reported. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a bit more to the mystery.  
</P>
<P>
	Both Cicero's ball and Mrs. Mantle's ball carry notations, ``My  
500th Home Run.'' In a photograph published in USA Today in 1987, 
Mantle was pictured with a ball signed, ``My 500th H.R.'' Cicero 
and Mrs. Mantle agree it's a totally different ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Mantle and her children are dumbfounded and can't explain  
why Mantle would have signed a third ball that way. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts think the controversy has forever diminished the value  
of Cicero's ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Jimmy Spence, a baseball authenticator in Orwigsburg, Pa., who  
reviewed photos of both balls, believes Cicero's is authentic. 
</P>
<P>
	``That ball now has a black mark on it,'' Spence said. ``He  
could put that ball in another auction and it wouldn't get half as 
much.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The sheriff's initial estimate of as  
many as 25 dead in the Columbine High massacre was off the mark 
apparently because the six SWAT teams that swept the building 
counted some victims more than once. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff John Stone said Tuesday afternoon that there could be as  
many as 25 dead. By early Wednesday, his deputies said the death 
toll was 15, including the two gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	The discrepancy occurred because the SWAT teams that picked  
their way past bombs and bodies in an effort to secure building 
covered overlapping areas, said sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis.

	``There were so many different SWAT teams in there, we were  
constantly getting different counts,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	As they gave periodic updates through the night, Davis and Stone  
emphasized the death toll was unconfirmed. They said their priority 
was making sure the school was safe.

<HEADLINE> Judge Nixes Race-Based Enrollment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal judge has ordered an end to 16  
years of race-based enrollment in San Francisco public schools, 
approving a settlement of a lawsuit by Chinese-Americans who were 
denied admission to the city's preferred campuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite protests by blacks and Hispanics, U.S. District Judge  
William Orrick said racial admissions violate Chinese Americans' 
constitutional rights to equal treatment in choosing their schools. 
He approved the settlement on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit was filed in 1994 on behalf of one student who was  
denied admission to a magnet high school despite a high score on 
its entrance exam -- higher than some non-Chinese students who were 
admitted -- and by two who were turned away from neighborhood 
elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement repeals a limit of 45 percent of any racial or  
ethnic group at a single school and 40 percent at desirable 
``magnet'' schools. Those limits were part of a 1983 consent 
decree, approved by Orrick, that settled a discrimination lawsuit 
filed in 1978 by the National Association for the Advancement of 
Colored People. 
</P>
<P>
	The district has until October to prepare a new enrollment plan  
for the fall of 2000 to maintain diversity in schools without 
assigning any student primarily because of race. 
</P>
<P>
	``Resegregation is inevitable,'' declared Robert Franklin, who  
said he lives in San Francisco so that his two children -- a 
7-year-old black girl and a 2-year-old white boy -- can attend its 
schools. ``I want to keep them in an integrated, racially diverse 
public school.''

<HEADLINE> EU Won't Appeal WTO Banana Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Union will not appeal a  
World Trade Organization's ruling that its banana import policies 
are illegal, officials announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU also is considering a ban on all U.S. beef starting June  
15 because traces of growth hormones have been found in some 
imports. 
</P>
<P>
	EU and U.S. officials will meet this week to discuss how the EU  
can bring its banana import policies into compliance with WTO rules 
and avoid fines Washington has been allowed to impose. 
</P>
<P>
	``There won't be an appeal, either on the substance or on the  
systemic or procedural questions,'' EU spokesman Nigel Gardner 
said. On Monday, the EU promised to change its banana import 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
	A WTO panel ruled April 9 the EU banana import system  
discriminated against imports of Latin American bananas in favor of 
imports from former European colonies in Africa and the Caribbean. 
The panel authorized the United States to impose sanctions of up to 
$191 million a year against the EU. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington has imposed 100 percent tariffs on EU products,  
including French handbags, German coffee-makers, bed linens and 
cardboard packing materials. 
</P>
<P>
	Next week, EU veterinary officials will consider a proposal to  
ban U.S. beef. If they agree with the proposal, it will return to 
the European Commission for final approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1988, the European Union has only imported U.S. beef  
certified as hormone-free, a measure the WTO has ruled illegal. The 
U.S. beef industry claims the requirement costs producers and 
exporters $250 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	EU imports of hormone-free U.S. beef from certified  
slaughterhouses total 7,700 tons and are worth $20 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The certified slaughterhouses are on a list that must  
occasionally be renewed. The European Commission agreed to renew 
the list until June 15 but could ban all beef imports after that, 
said EU spokesman Gerard Kiely. 
</P>
<P>
	He said meat inspections between May and November found hormone  
residue in U.S. beef shipped to Western Europe as hormone-free. The 
inspections found residue in 12 percent of 500 samples, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO ruled in 1997 that the EU import ban was illegal because  
it was based on risks posed by growth hormones rather than by their 
residues. The EU has until May 13 to comply with the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU maintains hormone-treated beef causes cancer in  
consumers. It is trying to comply with the WTO ruling by changing 
the scientific basis for its ban.

<HEADLINE> Two ``MJs'' Highlight Penn Relays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The two ``MJs'' are back for the Penn  
Relays. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Johnson and Marion Jones will return to Philadelphia  
tomorrow for one of track and field's oldest and most prestigious 
meets. And once again, they'll have their sights set on setting 
records in what has become the meet's signature event, the 
800-meter relays. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, a three-time Olympic gold medalist, will team Saturday  
with Jon Drummond, Maurice Greene and Tim Harden in a quartet that 
could threaten the world record of 1 minute, 18:68 seconds. Greene 
and Harden finished first and second in the world indoor 60 meters 
this year in Tokyo, separated by .01 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Franklin Field, site of the relays, has seen the 800 record fall  
before. A team featuring Carl Lewis broke the American record in 
1992 and a women's team anchored last year by Jones became the 
first American team to dip under 1:30. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't come to the Penn Relays not ready to run,'' said  
coach Bev Kearney of Texas, one of the favorites in the collegiate 
women's field. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, the world's top-ranked sprinter and long jumper last  
year, will also team with Gail Devers, Inger Miller and Susanthika 
Jayasinghe on a 400-meter relay team. In the last outdoor world 
championship in 1997, Jones won the 100 while Jayasinghe, 
representing Sri Lanka, won the silver in the 200. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Olympic medalists scheduled to compete in the three-day  
meet include Allen Johnson, Deon Hemmings, Chryste Gaines, Quincy 
Watts and Bruny Surin. 
</P>
<P>
	In men's collegiate events, the distance specialists from  
Arkansas are strong contenders again to dominate the 1,600-meter 
distance medley and the 4-mile relay. 
</P>
<P>
	The Razorbacks have won the distance medley six times this  
decade, but were thwarted by Michigan last year. Arkansas hopes to 
reclaim the title this year with a likely lineup of Sharif Karie, 
James Karanu, and Matt Kerr and Kwame Lassiter, who previously made 
their marks in the relays while in high school. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina coach Curtis Frye hopes his crew can slow  
Arkansas, along with other favorites Texas Christian and Texas, but 
is also wary of other schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people with the horses are the West Coast teams -- USC and  
UCLA, plus those (TCU and Texas),'' Frye said. ``We're awfully 
young. It will take a couple of years to get into the chase with 
them. I try to tell the kids the Penn Relays mean a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TCU is the favorite in the shorter relays but faces stiffer  
competition in the 400 relay it won last year in 38.91. That's 
because seven teams in this year's field, including TCU, have 
already gone below 39.50 this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	On the women's side, streaking Texas is the favorite in the  
shorter relays. At this year's Texas Relays, the Longhorns broke 
its collegiate record in 1:30:93, winning the race by 4 1/2 seconds 
with a team of Aminah Haddad, Suziann Reid, Lakeisha Backus and 
Nanceen Perry. 
</P>
<P>
	Kearney says her squad will face stiff competition from LSU.  
</P>
<P>
	``LSU always has Texas as a motivation and vice versa,'' the  
Texas women's coach said. ``But when it comes right down to it and 
the gun goes off, if you don't do your job, it doesn't matter. We 
may not be at each other's forefront in our thinking, but we're 
definitely on each other's minds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LSU coach Pat Henry says he wishes he could set a goal of  
winning four relays this year, something Texas thinks it has a 
chance of achieving. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's so many factors in Philadelphia that dictate what  
happens. You've got to be ready to make some changes as the meet 
goes,'' Henry said. ``We just want to run hard, compete well and 
leave healthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin, Villanova and Georgetown are contenders in the  
distance medley and 6,000 relay. In the latter race, the Wildcats 
can field a team that includes two NCAA champions (Carrie Tollefson 
and Carmen Douma) and one NCAA runner-up (Krissy Jost).

<HEADLINE> Moonshine Distillers Get Legit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRANVILLE, W. Va. (AP) -- Legal moonshine?  
</P>
<P>
	Well yes, two West Virginia entrepreneurs have received a  
license to distill the stuff of Southern legend, joining a handful 
of others around the country who are hoping to make clear corn 
whiskey a mainstream drink. 
</P>
<P>
	Bo McDaniel, owner of a local auto body shop, and Payton  
Fireman, an attorney in nearby Morgantown, are partners in the West 
Virginia Distilling Co. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday they became the state's only licensed distillers  
and its first legal makers of the drink they call Mountain 
Moonshine. 
</P>
<P>
	They aren't the first in the nation to do it, but there are only  
a handful. The Southern Beverage Journal, for example, lists only 
three clear corn whiskeys, marketed under the labels Georgia Moon, 
Mellow Corn and Seagrams GC. 
</P>
<P>
	McDaniel and Fireman are counting on the novelty of the product,  
and some marketing help from the state-run liquor wholesaling 
agency, to get their company started. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody knows that mountain moonshine exists,'' said  
Fireman. ``Very few people have ever had the opportunity to taste 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Fireman and McDaniel haven't distilled a drop. Their  
start-up company will work in a converted bay of McDaniel's body 
shop with a formula to distill clear, 80-proof corn whiskey from 
fermented mash. 
</P>
<P>
	The partners hope to produce as many as 1,000 cases by the end  
of the year. The first batches should be on the market by July, 
with a 750 ml bottle selling for about $12. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll have to perfect it on our own,'' said McDaniel, 56.  
``It's like baking a cake, I guess -- although I've never baked a 
cake, either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The entrepreneurs aren't likely to get any help from their  
backwoods counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're pretty secretive,'' McDaniel said. Besides, ``I don't  
know if they know what they made or they made it by accident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDaniel and Fireman already have an important ally. State  
Alcohol Beverage Control Commissioner Donald Stemple has promised 
to help get the company started. 
</P>
<P>
	West Virginia is one of 19 states that act as liquor  
wholesalers. Stemple said he will pitch Mountain Moonshine to his 
fellow liquor commissioners in Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Maine, 
New Hampshire and Vermont, for starters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this will sell very well,'' Stemple said.  
</P>
<P>
	Tom Pirko, president of Bevmark Inc., a New York-based  
management-consulting firm to the food and beverage industry, said 
the partners may be onto something -- ``if they're clever and they 
play with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Spirits is marketing, marketing, marketing. You need some way  
to differentiate yourself,'' Pirko said. ``They need to get tapes 
with the 'Deliverance' music playing in the store.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fireman, 41, sees the venture as akin to the independent beer  
brewers that were highly popular earlier in the decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is room for micro-distilleries just as there was in the  
beer business for micro-breweries,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pirko, however, said the concept will work only if the product  
is special. 
</P>
<P>
	The micro-brewery business, for example, has shrunk  
substantially in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It came and it went in large part because consumers were  
confused, products were coming and going, product consistency 
wasn't good,'' Pirko said. 
</P>
<P>
	Health-conscious folks aren't likely to seek out his product,  
but Fireman believes Mountain Moonshine will appeal to moderate 
drinkers who are conscious of what they consume. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a purer, cleaner ethyl alcohol than scotch, for  
example,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Like bourbon, clear corn whiskey is made from ground-up corn  
that is mixed with water to form a mash. Old-fashioned moonshine 
makers add sugar to speed up fermentation and raise the alcohol 
content. 
</P>
<P>
	Fireman and McDaniel will add yeast, but not sugar. As the corn  
breaks down in the water, the starch converts to a sugar that, 
along with the yeast, causes fermentation. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, the liquid, called ``beer water,'' is pumped off the  
mash into a steel tank, where 30 gallons will eventually cook down 
to three gallons of whiskey. Bourbon makers age their product at 
least two years in oak barrels. Moonshine makers don't wait. 
</P>
<P>
	If West Virginia Distilling is successful, Pirko predicted major  
competition will spring up fast. 
</P>
<P>
	``Suddenly there's going to be a moonshine section in the back  
of the package store. ...The beverage business in the king of the 
knockoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stemple, the liquor commissioner, doesn't worry much about  
competitors. With taxes running $13.50 per gallon of 100-proof 
liquor, he said, ``It's a lot more profitable to do it illegally.''

<HEADLINE> School Shooting Leaves Many Puzzled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	It is telling, Joanne McDaniel says, that the boys who drenched  
Columbine High School with blood could not recall a time before 
televisions had remote controls. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's teen-agers, she says, are accustomed to a life of  
instant results -- press a button, something happens. But a very few 
take that to murderous extremes: Pull a trigger, and your problems 
go away. 
</P>
<P>
	``When things don't go right for them, it's a high-speed rage,''  
says Ms. McDaniel, research director of the Center for the 
Prevention of School Violence at North Carolina State University. 
</P>
<P>
	Does this explain why America has been forced to watch, in ever  
growing horror, as kids have sprayed bullets in Oregon and 
Arkansas, Kentucky and Colorado? 
</P>
<P>
	Yes. No. Maybe.  
</P>
<P>
	The mayhem at Littleton shows that ``something is wrong with  
America,'' said conservative activist Gary Bauer, declaring his 
presidential candidacy on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But what exactly is wrong?  
</P>
<P>
	Too many kids have access to too many guns, educators and  
experts say. But beyond that, there is little agreement among 
educators and experts on why we have seen these schoolhouse 
massacres. 
</P>
<P>
	Franklin Zimring, a professor at Boalt School of Law at the  
University of California at Berkeley, says many of these young 
gunmen have been copycats -- inspired by and imitating the others. 
</P>
<P>
	He does not think these shootings represent any major fissure in  
the American soul. ``It is not at all clear that that kind of 
breast-beating is a very good prelude to public policy,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Kett, a professor of history at the University of  
Virginia, has questioned whether today's students are more violent 
than those of the 19th century. Educator Horace Mann, he points 
out, once decried attacks by older students on teachers in rural 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1840, a student killed a professor at the University of  
Virginia with a muzzleloader. If he had had access to a gun that 
could shoot more than once, he might have had more victims. 
</P>
<P>
	But like their elders, today's violent youths do have more  
dangerous weapons. ``If adults were doing this, it would be 
workplace violence,'' Ms. McDaniel says. 
</P>
<P>
	And she says today's violent youths are exposed to many images  
of violence -- on television, on the Internet, in music and 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Sissela Bok, author of ``Mayhem: Violence as Public  
Entertainment,'' says violence is marketed in ways that young 
people find exciting. The youngest cannot handle this, she says. 
Nor can the most disturbed. 
</P>
<P>
	But she says media violence ``is not the major factor'' in  
violent acts by kids. Dysfunctional families, psychiatric problems, 
substance abuse all play roles, she says. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one asks whether heart disease is caused by fatty foods,  
cholesterol, lack of exercise,'' Ms. Bok says. ``We know that it is 
all these things together. What we can do is address as many of 
these things as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sally Downham Miller has been an educator for 25 years -- the  
last nine of them as principal of the high school in Ridgewood, 
N.J. She has seen a change in children in that time: ``They are 
leading more isolated lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a mobile society, she says, kids are deprived of extended  
families, and so they have lost their sounding boards -- older 
relatives who would offer a kind ear. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, many kids come from families in which both  
parents work. They go home to empty houses, and to the violence on 
television and in other media. When they need advice, she says, 
they often turn to each other, and their friends do not necessarily 
have the wisdom they need. 
</P>
<P>
	She, like others interviewed, does not think that kids as a  
whole are more prone to violence than other generations of 
teen-agers. Ms. McDaniel says an old rule of thumb is still valid: 
7 percent of the kids cause 90 percent of the problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Nor does Ms. McDaniel ascribe any particular meaning to the fact  
that the school killings over the past two years have occurred in 
suburban or rural schools. Urban schools may just have better 
security, she says. 
</P>
<P>
	John ``Bud'' DeLaurentis is principal at Upper Moreland High  
School in suburban Philadelphia -- the same school from which he 
graduated more than 40 years ago. He thinks students ``keep getting 
better, more well-behaved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he sees changes. Years ago, disputes were settled ``with  
a fist or a fight outside. Today, it's a weapon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was visiting the middle school Wednesday when he heard about  
a student who told a classmate, ``I want to get some guns and do 
the same thing'' that the two teen-agers did in Littleton. 
</P>
<P>
	With that he received a three-day suspension. The boy complained  
that he was just joking. 
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' says DeLaurentis. ``You don't kid about these things  
anymore.''

<HEADLINE> USDA Defends Crop Insurance System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Agriculture Department on Wednesday  
defended the federally subsidized crop insurance program against 
accusations by the agency's internal watchdog that the program is 
riddled with errors and fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	``We run a clean program,'' Ken Ackerman, administrator of  
USDA's Risk Management Agency, told the Senate Agriculture 
Committee. ``It is cleaner or as clean as any (insurance) program 
run in the private sector.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A report last month by USDA's inspector general said the  
insurance system was prone to abuse because taxpayers bear most of 
the risk for losses, not the private companies selling and 
servicing the policies. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said insurance claims frequently are rubber-stamped  
by adjustors to keep producers from dropping out of the program. 
The companies keep a share of the premiums that farmers pay. The 
report also cited cases in which sales agents worked for the 
farmers to whom they sold insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have instance after instance in all parts of the country  
... where we find problems,'' said James Ebbitt, the assistant 
inspector general in charge of audits. 
</P>
<P>
	Ackerman conceded that the report painted ``a very damning  
picture.'' But he said it ``presents only part of the picture'' and 
he criticized the report as containing several factual errors. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the department increased the financial risk to the  
private companies that handle the policies and reduced the fees 
they receive, Ackerman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The program costs the government $1.4 billion a year. Congress  
is considering doubling that by 2001 to make the coverage cheaper 
for producers and to expand the insurance to more crops and even 
livestock. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past four years, the government has paid $5.4 billion  
to farmers, while the companies have received $2.8 billion in 
administrative fees and profits on the business. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., expressed alarm at the size of the  
companies' earnings. ``It seems way out of line to me,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the insurance companies say crop losses have been unusually  
low in recent years, and that their profits could evaporate in one 
year with a widespread drought. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, when insurance premiums exceed losses, insurance  
companies will not show a loss. That is simply a sign of a good 
year, not evidence of a bad system,'' said Ron Brichler, chairman 
of National Crop Insurance Services, an industry group.

<HEADLINE> N.J. Report Admits Racial Profiling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Complaints that state troopers target  
blacks and Hispanics along the heavily traveled New Jersey Turnpike 
are ``real, not imagined,'' according to a report issued by the 
state's attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, released Tuesday, concludes that even though the  
state police have no policy condoning the practice known as racial 
profiling, it does exist -- and was fostered in part by ambiguous 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question racial profiling exists at some level,''  
Gov. Christie Whitman said. ``These findings are distressing and 
disturbing. Minorities deserve the assurance they will be treated 
no differently than any other motorist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report, commissioned by state Attorney General Peter  
Verniero, stresses ``the great majority of state troopers are 
honest, dedicated professionals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the force's command structure needs to institute policy  
changes to end a culture that encourages using race as a reason to 
stop motorists, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
	While six out of 10 motorists stopped are white, minorities are  
far more likely to be subjected to searches and aggressive 
treatment by troopers, the report said. Statistics show that 77.2 
percent of motorist searches were of blacks or Hispanics, and only 
21.4 percent were of white motorists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Minority motorists have been treated differently than  
non-minority motorists during the course of traffic stops on the 
New Jersey Turnpike,'' the report says. ``We conclude the problem 
of disparate treatment is real -- not imagined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report came one day after two troopers were indicted on  
charges they falsified reports to make it appear that some of the 
black motorists they pulled over were white. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Justice Department also has been investigating racial  
profiling allegations against New Jersey's state police. Similar 
accusations have been made in Florida, Maryland, Connecticut and 
elsewhere along the Interstate 95 corridor. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings in the report confirm what many civil rights  
activists said they have known for years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not believe that any reasonable person in New Jersey is  
surprised at all today to hear this acknowledgment,'' said The Rev. 
Reginald Jackson, executive director of the Black Ministers Council 
of New Jersey. ``Now, however, comes the hard and difficult part, 
and that is the process of ending racial profiling.''

<HEADLINE> Arafat May Delay Statehood Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) -- The Palestinians may delay their  
decision on whether to declare independence until after Israel's 
May 17 election, Yasser Arafat's senior adviser said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a move would deprive Israel's hard-line prime minister,  
Benjamin Netanyahu, of ammunition in his re-election campaign. 
Netanyahu has branded Arafat as an unreliable peace partner who has 
repeatedly violated the agreements with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu has threatened to annex parts of the West Bank in  
response to a unilateral declaration of statehood on May 4, the end 
of the five-year interim period of Palestinian autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinian Central Council, a 124-member PLO body stacked  
with Arafat loyalists, is to convene Tuesday to begin discussions 
on whether to declare statehood May 4 or agree to an extension of 
the autonomy period as the United States and the European Union 
have requested. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat's senior adviser, Nabil Abourdeineh, told The Associated  
Press on Wednesday that the session would be ``open-ended and it 
might take days or even weeks'' for the council to reach a 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	By prolonging the council session, Arafat could get around the  
problem of disappointing his constituents, many of whom expect him 
to take dramatic action May 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat initially said he would declare statehood that day, but  
has since softened his position. In recent weeks, he has toured the 
world to consult with foreign leaders on the statehood issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat told his Cabinet recently that he encountered  
overwhelming opposition abroad to any unilateral move. 
</P>
<P>
	Those close to Arafat say they believe he will not take any  
action on May 4 so as not to boost Netanyahu's chances of getting 
re-elected.

<HEADLINE> General Dynamics Earnings Up 20 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FALLS CHURCH, Va. (AP) -- General Dynamics reported its  
first-quarter earnings rose 20 percent, boosted in part by 
increased federal spending on Navy ships. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense contractor said Wednesay it earned $100 million, or  
78 cents per share, up from $82 million, or 65 cents per share, a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The results beat Wall Street analysts' expectations of 72 cents  
per share, according to First Call Corp., a financial research 
network. General Dynamics stock soared nearly 7 percent, rising 
$4.50 to close at $71 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the quarter were $1.38 billion, up from $1.15  
billion in the first quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	General Dynamics said its results included a one-time gain from  
a research and experimentation tax credit refund that settled the 
company's tax claims for 1981-1989. With the credit included, 
General Dynamics' earnings were $265 million, or $2.07 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's Marine Systems group, which includes its  
shipbuilding divisions, had a 46 percent revenue jump during the 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	General Dynamics said it expects revenue growth to continue. The  
government's fiscal year 2000 defense budget includes $6.6 billion 
for U.S. Navy shipbuilding. ``We will participate in nearly every 
shipbuilding program in the Navy's plan,'' chairman and CEO 
Nicholas D. Chabraja said. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues were down in the company's combat systems division,  
which produces tanks and land-based defense equipment, reflecting 
the end of the SINCGARS production program for the U.S. Army. 
However, the company said it expects orders for more tanks later 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's information systems and technology division had a  
7 percent revenue increase. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falls Church, Va.-based defense contractor makes nuclear  
submarines and the Aegis class of warships for the Navy, and the M1 
Abrams battle tank for the Army.

<HEADLINE> China Pulls Out of Cannes Film Fest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Complaining that foreigners read too much  
politics into Chinese films, director Zhang Yimou has pulled his 
two latest movies out of next month's Cannes Film Festival, China's 
state-run media reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhang, director of the Oscar-nominated ``Raise the Red  
Lantern,'' withdrew ``Not One Less'' and ``My Parents'' from the 
festival on Sunday, the state-run Economic Daily reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision seemed to win him praise in China, where he has  
been criticized for pandering to Western audiences and showing only 
the negative aspects of Chinese life. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Cannes jury president David Cronenberg, Zhang  
complained of a tendency to divide Chinese movies into only two 
categories: anti-government or pro-Beijing propaganda. And only the 
anti-government ones are highly regarded abroad, the director said, 
according to excerpts of the letter published by the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhang was responding to Cronenberg's public comment that the two  
films had artistic merit but were propaganda, the newspaper and the 
government's Xinhua News Agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	He argued that both movies were about love, and that he  
suspected political or cultural prejudice behind the criticism, 
Xinhua said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not One Less,'' just released in Beijing, uses ordinary  
villagers instead of actors to tell the story of a substitute 
teacher in a poor school. ``My Parents'' is a love story from the 
1950s.

<HEADLINE> Shooting Comes Amid Colo. Gun Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The shooting rampage at a suburban Denver high  
school prompted state lawmakers to delay action on a bill that 
would help gun owners obtain concealed weapons permits. 
</P>
<P>
	Local government leaders have criticized the measure, which  
already has passed the state Senate. A House panel had planned to 
take up the measure today, but legislative leaders decided to 
postpone action in light of Tuesday's shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would require sheriffs to grant concealed weapons  
permits if applicants pass a number of conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Doug Dean, R-Colorado Springs, sponsor of the bill, said  
the Littleton tragedy might have been offset if a faculty member, 
or administrator, had been armed. 
</P>
<P>
	But Russell George, R-Rifle, said he had received calls  
expressing the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm getting e-mails from people saying: `See what happens when  
you have guns? And you legislators are talking about allowing more 
guns in society, and here's the harm that comes,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Senate version of the bill, people couldn't carry  
their handguns on school grounds or into schools, government 
buildings or bars.

<HEADLINE> Court Asked To Block CBS Broadcast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal court in North Carolina has been asked  
to play the role of television programmer following a request to 
stop tonight's broadcast of a ``60 Minutes II'' investigation into 
a chain of psychiatric hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Charter Behavioral Health Systems, which runs 91 hospitals in 32  
states, accuses CBS of violating patient confidentiality by sending 
a worker with a hidden camera into a Charter facility in Charlotte, 
N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The social worker, who wore a tiny camera on his eyeglasses,  
allegedly documented cases of falsified records and patient 
mistreatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing this afternoon in Federal District Court in  
Charlotte was scheduled to begin less than eight hours before the 
report's airtime. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes a sad statement if you can't be treated in a hospital  
and not know that the confidentiality of whatever illness you're 
dealing with is not going to be videotaped,'' Charter spokeswoman 
Karen Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jenkins said confidentiality was breached not just by the  
camera, but by the hiring of a clinical worker, Terrance Johnson, 
who reported his findings to CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	The faces were blurred and voices altered for any patients  
caught by the hidden camera, CBS News President Andrew Heyward 
said. ``We're completely concealing the identity,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Heyward said CBS rejects Charter's contentions that the network  
violated a law regarding recording someone without their consent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very proud of this broadcast,'' Heyward said. ``I feel  
it performs an important public service and it is in the public 
interest for the broadcast to be seen. It is not in the public 
interest for this broadcast to be suppressed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute over use of hidden cameras by a television news  
organization comes two years after a North Carolina jury slammed 
ABC for using the technique in an investigation of the Food Lion 
supermarkets. The jury ordered ABC to pay Food Lion $5.5 million, 
an award later reduced to $315,000 and still under appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Networks say the Food Lion case did not scare them away from  
using hidden cameras, but they are using strict standards to govern 
their use. The ABC, CBS and NBC policies on hidden cameras are 
similar. Management must specifically approve their use, usually in 
writing and after review by lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dateline NBC'' used hidden cameras for a story Monday about  
bad meat, and ``60 Minutes'' used them Sunday to interview someone 
who had come into contact with Olympic Park bombing suspect Eric 
Robert Rudolph. 
</P>
<P>
	The networks couldn't say whether their use of hidden cameras  
had increased or decreased since the Food Lion case, but NBC 
executive David McCormick said he suspects it has dropped.

<HEADLINE> Twins Exec Pays Nude Beach Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Minnesota Twins assistant general manager Joe  
McIlvaine paid a fine for sunbathing nude on a public beach in 
Florida and will keep his job with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is embarrassed about the scenario, as I am,'' general  
manager Terry Ryan said Tuesday. ``He made a mistake. I acknowledge 
it, I'm embarrassed about it and so is the whole organization. 
That's that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan said McIlvaine, former general manager of the New York  
Mets, paid a fine in Jensen Beach, Fla., to settle the misdemeanor 
indecent exposure charge. 
</P>
<P>
	McIlvaine was arrested last week after Martin County sheriff's  
deputies answered several calls complaining about a man lying on 
his stomach on the beach without any clothes on. 
</P>
<P>
	McIlvaine's lawyer, Michael Rubin, said McIlvaine thought he was  
on a private beach and not violating any rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan said he is satisfied that McIlvaine, 51, has been punished  
enough by the embarrassment. He considers the matter closed.

<HEADLINE> World Horrified by School Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Remembering 16 tiny coffins after a gunman opened  
fire in a Scottish school three years ago, Britain urged the United 
States on Wednesday to respond to its deadliest school massacre by 
putting handguns out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain imposed a near-total ban on handguns after Thomas  
Hamilton used four legally owned guns to kill 16 kindergarten 
children and their teacher before killing himself on March 13, 
1996, in Dunblane. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's school attack by two Littleton, Colo., teen-agers who  
laughed as they shot victims and then killed themselves, stunned 
much of the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that they will look carefully at what this country did  
in banning handguns after the Dunblane massacre, and I hope we 
never have to wake up to this sort of news again from America,'' 
Defense Secretary George Robertson told British Broadcasting Corp. 
radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Many reports from around the world criticized the easy  
availability of guns in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``How sick is the gun society of America?'' mused an article in  
the Yomiuri daily in Japan, where reports focused on how the two 
suspects appeared to target minorities and athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The shooting has brought to light once again the warped  
strains of 'an advanced society,''' said an article in the national 
Asahi newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with Asahi, Mieko Hattori, the mother of a  
16-year-old Japanese exchange student in the United States who was 
fatally shot in 1992 while looking for a Halloween party, said she 
hoped the latest shootings would lead to tighter gun control laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guns are still everywhere. Even a high school student can get  
them,'' she was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Vatican, Pope John Paul II urged Americans to seek ``the  
moral vision and the values which alone can ensure respect for the 
inviolable dignity of human life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some weren't optimistic that this would happen.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is no reason to believe that America will now wake up,  
as President Bill Clinton hopes,'' said the Oslo, Norway, newspaper 
Aftenposten, pointing out that previous school killings had 
prompted little action. 
</P>
<P>
	British gun laws, now among the tightest in the world, allow  
police to seek the full medical history of anyone applying for a 
gun license, including details of any mental health problems. Every 
applicant must provide the names of two people who have known them 
for at least two years and who support their application. 
</P>
<P>
	The few exceptions to the ban include antique weapons, starting  
pistols, and small shot pistols used against rats, mice and other 
pests.

<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The deadly school shooting in suburban Denver  
prompted calls today for tighter weapons controls in the United 
States, with Britain's defense secretary urging a ban on handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	In nearly all of Asia, the shooting topped news broadcasts and  
was splashed on the front pages of newspapers. Pope John Paul II 
said he was ``deeply shocked,'' while those who three years ago 
experienced the tragedy of a lone gunman shooting 16 kindergarten 
children and a teacher in the Scottish town of Dunblane sounded a 
warning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I woke up this morning with a sense of horror that this kind  
of gun tragedy can take place inside one of the most civilized 
countries in the world,'' British Defense Secretary George 
Robertson, who lives near Dunblane, told BBC radio. ``I hope that 
they will look carefully at what this country did in banning 
handguns after the Dunblane massacre and I hope we never have to 
wake up to this sort of news again from America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly all world reaction focused on the availability of weapons  
in the United States and the perceived lack of social constraints 
that allowed teen-agers to turn on classmates. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telegram to the archbishop of Denver, the pope said he  
hoped American society would react to the killings ``by committing 
itself to promoting and transmitting the moral vision and the 
values which alone can ensure respect for the inviolable dignity of 
human life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Yugoslavia, targeted again today by U.S. warplanes and other  
NATO jets, the official Tanjug news agency said the attack at the 
high school ``proves that America is the country of violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shootings in Colorado topped the news in Hong Kong, Japan,  
New Delhi, Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea. As in Europe, where 
gun controls are strict, many reports focused on gun ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia's federal education minister, David Kemp, said tighter  
gun laws in his country meant schoolyard massacres were less 
likely. ``The ready availability of guns in the United States has 
contributed to a culture where even very young people who don't 
have any obvious reason for possession of firearms have got access 
to them,'' Kemp said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister John Howard of Australia said ``it sickens all of  
us when something like that happens. '' 
</P>
<P>
	And in Japan, the Colorado killings called to mind a shooting  
attributed to loose American gun laws. Mieko Hattori, the mother of 
a 16-year-old exchange student shot dead in Louisiana in 1992 while 
looking for a Halloween party, hoped the killings would finally 
serve as a wake-up call for tighter gun control laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guns are still everywhere, even a high school student can get  
them,'' the Asahi newspaper quoted her as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Itaru Arizono, a Japanese education expert, said: ``the No. 1  
problem is that guns are so easy to get in the United States, even 
by youngsters.'' He warned that ``if we don't watch out, the same 
tragedy could happen in Japan.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. &AMP; NATO: Past, Present, Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It took a world war followed by a cold war to  
get the United States to give up some of its insular ways and look 
outward. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation underwent a remarkable transformation after World War  
II. Suddenly, faraway crises were America's problem, too. And no 
more so than in Europe, mother continent to a vast American 
majority, as she gained protection from her headstrong, grownup 
offspring in the form of NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	``Talk about adapting,'' exclaimed President Truman, who coaxed  
this transformation. ``Talk about adjusting. Talk about responding 
as a people to the challenge of changed times and circumstances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This weekend, Washington welcomes 42 foreign leaders for  
meetings marking NATO's 50th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
	At the start of the alliance, even as the United States was  
pledging itself to Europe's defense, the country was on the cusp of 
becoming less European. When NATO started, four in five immigrants 
came from Europe; that's down to one in five today. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the postwar world, America's imperative was clear. No  
more would the United States hew to a foreign policy line first 
characterized by the founders. George Washington's caution -- 
``Europe has a set of primary interests which to us have none or a 
very remote relation'' -- was for the past. Thomas Jefferson's 
injunction against ``entangling alliances'' would not hold the 
nation back. 
</P>
<P>
	Collective security, so long mistrusted in a nation that didn't  
enter World War II until the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, became 
``the foundation stone of all our actions now,'' as Truman put it. 
</P>
<P>
	And so came the U.S.-financed rebuilding of postwar Europe under  
the Marshall Plan. 
</P>
<P>
	So, too, the formation of the United Nations in 1945, driven  
largely by the United States, which had shunned the League of 
Nations after World War I. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Truman Doctrine, proposing ``to support free peoples who  
are resisting subjugation by armed minorities or by outside 
pressures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And NATO, now 50 years old and -- unlike the Soviet Union it was  
formed to contain -- still counting. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Korea, Vietnam, Kuwait, Kosovo and more -- bold and  
sometimes all too bloody engagements, some making Americans wish 
the world could go away once more. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have learned that we cannot live alone,'' President  
Roosevelt said in 1945. ``We have learned to be citizens of the 
world, members of the human community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What a change from the aftermath of World War I, when Americans  
retrenched, the America First isolationist movement grew and 
President Wilson's prewar vision of a world safe for democracy sank 
in a toxic stew of European totalitarianism. 
</P>
<P>
	With NATO, the United States and fellow members resolved that an  
attack on one member ``shall be considered an attack on all.'' It's 
a principle that, with NATO's recent expansion, now connects the 
likes of Budapest and Baltimore in a binding commitment to the 
territory of 19 member states. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans finally recognized ``the security and well-being of  
Europe were really part of the security and well-being of the 
United States,'' says retired Gen. Andrew J. Goodpaster, a former 
NATO supreme commander who served President Eisenhower as staff 
secretary and defense liaison. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Soviet Union gone, U.S. interests diversifying and  
ancestral ties to Europe slowly receding with the flood of 
immigrants from other places, some say the United States again 
needs to respond to changed circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are living on the remnants of our Cold War constitution,''  
says David. P. Calleo, for 30 years the director of European 
studies at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International 
Studies. ``How long can we expect this venerable Atlanticist fervor 
to sustain the heavy U.S. involvement required to manage Europe's 
security? 
</P>
<P>
	``Meanwhile, America's role in Asia is growing inexorably,'' he  
writes in a collection of NATO perspectives by the Center for 
Political and Strategic Studies. ``The U.S. may well find more and 
more of its military and diplomatic resources drawn toward Asia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Latin America, the principal source of immigrants today, and  
Asia, the second largest source, are making the United States 
somewhat less Eurocentric as the years go by. Because of the 
Hispanic influence, more people in the United States speak Spanish 
-- over 17 million -- than all other languages combined, except 
English. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet over 80 percent of Americans still claim non-Spanish  
European ancestry. And even critics of ``NATO forever'' recognize 
the importance to the United States of a Europe safe from major 
conflict and open to trade and investment. The European Union has a 
larger economy than that of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	William Perry, defense secretary in President Clinton's first  
term, says Americans won't continue to support an alliance ``that 
appears to focus on nonexistent threats of aggression in Europe.'' 
He wants NATO to be able to project power outside its territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Russia ensures the United States won't take its eyes off  
Europe. The danger to member states ``is by no means as acute,'' 
Goodpaster says, ``but it's latent and we don't want it to 
re-emerge.''

<HEADLINE> Goals at Premium for Sens, Sabres / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANATA, Ontario (AP) -- Judging from the regular season, goals  
are going to be at a premium when the Buffalo Sabres and Ottawa 
Senators meet tonight in Game 1 of their Eastern Conference 
quarterfinal. 
</P>
<P>
	All five games between the teams went into overtime this season,  
with the Senators winning 3-2 on Dec. 30 in Buffalo and the other 
four going unresolved. The 3-2 win was also the only time one team 
managed to score three goals. Only 15 goals were scored in total by 
both teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a battle,'' said Senators defenceman Wade  
Redden. ``But that's the price we have to pay to advance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the league's top two leaders in goals-against average in  
Ron Tugnutt and Dominik Hasek, the emphasis will be on defence and 
special teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've played a lot against Dominik Hasek,'' said Senators  
winger Shawn McEachern. ``We aren't expecting any high-scoring 
games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two clubs are meeting in the playoffs for the second time in  
three years, with Buffalo eliminating Ottawa from its first-ever 
modern-day playoff appearance two seasons ago courtesy of Derek 
Plante's Game 7 overtime goal against Tugnutt. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always been a great intensity against them,'' said  
Senators winger Daniel Alfredsson. ``We can't just focus on their 
goaltending. They have a good team in front of him as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alfredsson says there is a way to beat the Dominator.  
</P>
<P>
	``You have to make it tough for him to see the puck,'' said  
Alfredsson. ``We know we have to shoot a lot and be there for the 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing is you can't think he'll be there to stop  
everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek played all five games between the two teams during the  
regular season, surrendering eight goals, three in the final three 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's their best player,'' Alfredsson said. ``But he's not  
their only player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tugnutt, who led the NHL with a GAA of 1.79 this season, doesn't  
think his club should be too focused on Hasek. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to be concerned with the way, the style of hockey that  
they play,'' he said, adding that both teams play a tight, 
defensive style of hockey. ``It's not just Dominik Hasek we have to 
beat, although he is a major part of that team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senators were 3-2-5 in their final 10 regular season games,  
a slump that didn't concern coach Jacques Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're well prepared,'' Martin said. ``We're a team  
looking forward to starting the playoffs, we're anxious.''

<HEADLINE> Many Tell Shooting Story on TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The siege over, teen survivors of the Colorado  
school shooting turned television into a public grief counseling 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the students who had been in Columbine High School were  
willing, even eager, to share their stories on TV. Their interviews 
dominated Wednesday's near-constant cable news coverage of the 
massacre's aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're the most compelling part of the story,'' said John  
Moody, Fox News Channel vice president of news. ``Every time I see 
a new person, I want to hear their stories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the potential to cross the line between information and  
exploitation, news executives said they were trying to be sensitive 
and not bother people who wanted to keep their trauma private. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the shooting even ended on Tuesday, one student used a  
cell phone to call Denver's KUSA-TV from the school to describe 
what was going on. The conversation was aired live by the station 
and picked up by CNN and MSNBC. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerned that the student could alert the gunmen to his  
whereabouts, MSNBC cut away from the conversation and KUSA-TV urged 
other students not to call. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt it was a bit uncomfortable,'' said Erik Sorenson,  
MSNBC's vice president and general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, most interview subjects had come back to the  
school, and many approached reporters, Sorenson said. One student 
got up after just a few hours of sleep and drove down to where 
reporters were camped out to share his story. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had some kids on last night who could have co-anchored our  
coverage, they were so media-savvy,'' Sorenson said. 
</P>
<P>
	One girl, Katie Crona, likened the sound of screams to ``people  
going downhill on a roller-coaster.'' Columbine freshman Sarah 
Lammers told how her father knew she was safe when he saw her on 
TV, running from the school. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine junior Steve Nason explained on MSNBC how he and some  
of his classmates crowded into an office to escape the gunmen, 
barricading the door with file cabinets and desks. 
</P>
<P>
	The day after, Nason spoke of the media attention.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a trip,'' he said. ``It's unbelievable. None of us had  
any idea how national this was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A psychologist said that talking about the experience often  
helps people involved in tragedies avoid suffering from 
post-traumatic stress syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	``Though it's not the primary point of what the media is doing,  
it's probably helping these kids,'' said Cynthia Last, director of 
the Anxiety Treatment Center at Nova Southeastern University in 
Fort Lauderdale, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	She said, however, that reporters should stay away from students  
who didn't want to speak and should keep their questions general. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's fair to interview a person in his or her teens  
who appears to be stable,'' Fox's Moody said. ``I wouldn't go over 
there and grab someone who is choking on tears or appears to be 
catching their breath.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's breaking coverage gave a big boost to the news  
networks. Fox News Channel, for example, had its highest 24-hour 
rating since its launch in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Many networks scrambled their plans to react to the tragedy. An  
MTV documentary about warning signs of teen-age violence was moved 
up from next week to Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nickelodeon took time out from filming a kids-oriented special  
about Kosovo to update a ``Kids and Guns'' special. It was 
scheduled to air Thursday.

<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Not even Oprah Winfrey has enough star  
power to evade the city's notoriously strict meter maids. 
</P>
<P>
	Two limousines had just picked up Ms. Winfrey and her entourage  
from a downtown hotel last Friday when the talk show hostess dashed 
back into the hotel for a minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Parking officers promptly began issuing tickets, ignoring the  
limo drivers' desperate pleas that Ms. Winfrey was on her way to 
deliver the keynote address at Mayor Willie Brown's women's summit. 
</P>
<P>
	The drivers were cited with two $43 tickets for parking in a  
commuter curb lane. 
</P>
<P>
	At the women's summit, Brown was overheard joking: ``The meter  
maid will be looking for a job tomorrow. Maybe in Chicago.''

<HEADLINE> Past Not Problem for N.J. Devils / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The Eastern Conference's best team  
in the regular season the past three years, its biggest playoff 
failure the last two. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the baggage the New Jersey Devils will carry into their  
first-round, best-of-7 playoff series with the Pittsburgh Penguins, 
starting tomorrow night. 
</P>
<P>
	With Robbie Ftorek having replaced Jacques Lemaire as coach, a  
younger team on the ice and a more offensive-oriented system in 
place, the Devils insist the past means nothing this year. They 
aren't haunted by either last year's opening-round loss to Ottawa 
or the second-round ouster by the Rangers two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an opportunity to prove how good this team is,''  
center Bobby Holik said. ``The situation was different last year. 
Whatever it was, we can't turn time back. We have to focus on this 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two positives the Devils can take into the series are the  
way they finished the season and their success against Penguins 
superstar Jaromir Jagr and his buddies. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey won four of five games against Pittsburgh, including  
the last four. The Devils also finished strongly, posting a 15-4-3 
record since Feb. 27, a run that carried them from fifth overall in 
the conference to the regular-season title. 
</P>
<P>
	During that same time, Pittsburgh was 6-11-7 in falling from  
sixth overall to the No. 8 seed. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, the Devils finished the regular season 3-5-2 under  
Lemaire and were ousted by the Senators in six games. Lemaire, who 
led the Devils to the Stanley Cup championship in 1995, resigned 
after the embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year we went stumbling into the playoffs and didn't have  
a lot of confidence,'' Devils left wing Dave Andreychuk said. 
``This year we have played well in the stretch drive and that is 
the difference. Hopefully, we can continue that way. It's tough to 
turn it on and off, as we all know from last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the line of Jason Arnott centering for Patrik Elias and  
Petr Sykora has carried the Devils down the stretch, the key to the 
team has been getting production from all four lines and the 
defensemen joining the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``They really play a lot of guys,'' Penguins coach Kevin  
Constantine said. ``They spread their lines around. They get 
offense from a lot of different areas. As opposed to having one guy 
who is a dominant player, they've got 12 good forwards, and they 
are all big and strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The one player the Devils have to worry about is Jagr, the NHL's  
leading scorer with 44 goals and 83 assists. He had a hand in 
almost 53 percent of the Penguins' offense this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have a lot of offense and they will get a lot goals if  
we're not careful,'' Andreychuk said. ``Jagr is a big part of their 
team but not the only part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other key scorers are Martin Straka (35 goals), Alexei  
Kovalev (23), Robert Lang (21) and Kip Miller (19). 
</P>
<P>
	Petr Sykora, who only played in two playoff games last season,  
led the Devils with 29 goals this season. Holik and Arnott added 27 
goals apiece and Brian Rolston had 24. Martin Brodeur led the NHL 
with 39 wins, although his goals against average jumped from 1.89 
to 2.29. 
</P>
<P>
	Penguins goaltender Tom Barrasso had a 2.55 GAA in just 43 games  
(19-16-3). 
</P>
<P>
	``We're making a commitment to this year,'' Devils veteran  
defenseman Ken Daneyko said. ``We don't want to look past anybody, 
and the Pittsburgh Penguins we certainly won't look past. They are 
a skilled hockey team with a lot of guys with individual, 
one-on-one skills. We have our work cut out in the first round.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Game 2 also will also be played at the Continental Airlines  
Arena on Saturday afternoon. The series shifts to Pittsburgh for a 
matinee on Sunday and Game 4 on tap Tuesday night.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Comforts Colorado Community </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton struggled from 1,500 miles  
away Wednesday to ease the horror and sorrow of Columbine High 
School. Cabinet officials mobilized what help they could offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The president weighed making a visit to the Littleton, Colo.,  
community like those he made to Oklahoma City after the 1995 
bombing and in June to Oregon's Thurston High, the last school 
shooting to burst into national headlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of us are struggling to understand exactly what happened  
and why. There is a deep desire to comfort the grieving and counsel 
the children,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	By moving a work session with British Prime Minister Tony Blair,  
Clinton made room in his Thursday schedule to visit northern 
Virginia's T.C. Williams High School and hear students' concerns 
about school violence. Aides were looking at the president's 
schedule next week for a possible visit with the students, parents 
and teachers of suburban Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, as a gesture of respect  
for the community's grief, canceled appearances at political 
fund-raising events Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials were looking for an appropriate way for  
the president personally to comfort Littleton, press secretary Joe 
Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president wants to do what's best for the local  
community,'' Lockhart said. ``We are especially sensitive to not 
causing any disruption or distraction to the ongoing efforts 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Clinton said the relative calm in the day after the  
gunfire inside Columbine was a good time for parents everywhere to 
reassure children of their safety -- and ``to take this moment once 
again to hammer home to all the children of America that violence 
is wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also beseeched parents to ``ask what else they can do to  
shield our children from violent images and experiences that warp 
young perceptions and obscure the consequences of violence -- to 
show our children by the power of our own example how to resolve 
conflicts peacefully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president said nothing about guns or gun control.  
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said later that Clinton's support for tightly  
restricting youth access to guns is well known -- but not much was 
immediately known about the weapons used at Columbine. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a dozen federal agents from the Bureau of Alcohol,  
Tobacco and Firearms focused on tracing the arsenal -- two sawed-off 
shotguns, one handgun and one carbine, the White House said -- to 
determine who licensed them, and how and where the teen-age 
suspects got hold of such firepower. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must cut off teen-agers' easy access to guns and drugs and  
work to change a popular culture that glorifies violence and 
mayhem,'' Gore said in a speech at New York's Ellis Island. ``The 
world's eyes are upon us and our children's eyes are upon us too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from the departments of Education, Treasury, Justice  
and Health and Human Services and from the Federal Emergency 
Management Administration held a morning-after conference call on 
what aid they could give Jefferson County, where Columbine High is 
located. Education Secretary Richard Riley consulted the local 
school superintendent by phone. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno was to fly to Denver and meet  
privately Thursday with law enforcement officials and 
victim-services providers, said Justice Department spokesman Myron 
Marlin. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we must do now is learn from this tragedy and use the  
lessons to help prevent future tragedies,'' Reno said at a 
Minneapolis appearance Wednesday. ``Although it comes as little 
comfort at a time like this, we must remember that schools are 
still among the safest places for America's children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department officials said federally trained crisis  
counselors already based in Denver would most likely be deployed to 
help Columbine students and their families. 
</P>
<P>
	The team was put in place by Justice to assist victim families  
who traveled to Denver to observe the trials of Timothy McVeigh and 
Terry Nichols for bombing the Oklahoma City federal building in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the position of the federal government, we would  
acknowledge that there are limits to what we can do,'' Lockhart 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``But there certainly should be no limits to what we try to do.  
... We stand ready to move in as quickly as the local community 
deems appropriate.''

<HEADLINE> How To Explain the School Shooting? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	At 8 years old, there's a lot Casey Clark doesn't understand  
about the massacre at Columbine High School. Why were those guys 
wearing coats in the spring? Is that person on the ground dead? And 
Mom, why are you crying? 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `But Mom, we're not even related to them,'' said  
Julie Clark, 42, a Des Moines nurse who has two sons. ``And I said 
`Casey, they're children, they're just kids. They had their whole 
world ahead of them.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Torn between whether to ``keep my kids in a cocoon or make them  
street smart,'' Mrs. Clark decided it was important to talk through 
what was on the news Tuesday night about the deadly shooting 
rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clark said Casey asked what she would do if someone came in  
a class with a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `I'd be on the floor -- boom. Because more than likely,  
they'll go after the people they see first,''' she said, her voice 
breaking at the memory of the conversation. ``It's very odd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Odd it may be, but similar discussions have been held at dinner  
tables and in carpools around the country since the shootings 
Tuesday afternoon in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	For the seventh time in 18 months, parents are faced with the  
same series of unanswerable questions about murder, hopelessness 
and whether there is such a thing as a safe place. Some say they're 
running out of answers. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's one of the problems, is that there is never an answer  
given for why. You can't find an answer and I think that would help 
the kids a lot and me a lot -- to say, this is why this occurred,'' 
said Tricia Johnson, who talked about the shootings with her five 
children over breakfast Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Johnson, who lives in rural Davidsonville, Md., outside  
Annapolis, said she and her friends agree that the best way to 
handle the topic with young children is to wait for them to bring 
it up, and then answer straightforwardly. That's what she tried to 
do when her 8-year-old daughter asked what was going on. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told her that I didn't know why, I didn't know what was  
wrong with these people that did it ... but that your school is 
safe and you're safe and our town is safe,'' she said. ``I tried to 
make it sound like an aberration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Child development experts were pessimistic Wednesday, saying  
most parents still don't listen closely to their children or prompt 
productive conversations about violence and teen angst, despite the 
recent spate of school shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Children are often talking about things like video games or  
something that happened at school that doesn't appear to be that 
interesting, and parents get distracted and don't listen closely, 
said Mary Margaret Kerr, an associate professor of psychiatry at 
the University of Pittsburgh who consults school districts on 
violence and trauma. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to say it's in those moments when parents need to  
really intensively listen -- it may just be the lead-in to what the 
child has on their mind or in their heart,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Miller, a work and family expert at Pace University in New  
York, agreed with Kerr that adults are likely still not talking 
openly enough with their children, particularly about issues of 
tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
	``It bothers me that over and over again everyone says they're  
going to have these damn discussions and no one does anything about 
it,'' he said. ``Open them up and say, 'How are you feeling about 
this?'''

<HEADLINE> Judge Refuses To Stop CBS Broadcast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- A federal judge refused to block CBS's  
hour-long telecast Wednesday night of a hidden-camera report on 
alleged dangerous conditions and falsified records at a psychiatric 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Charter Behavioral Health Systems, which runs 91 hospitals in 32  
states, accused CBS of violating patient confidentiality by sending 
a worker into a Charter facility in Charlotte with a tiny camera on 
his eyeglasses. 
</P>
<P>
	The health group's request for a temporary restraining order was  
denied just hours before the segment was to air on CBS' ``60 
Minutes II.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Using the hidden camera, clinical worker Terrance Johnson  
allegedly documented cases of falsified records and patient 
mistreatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The hidden camera footage that was broadcast showed his  
conversations with staff workers who changed the vital signs of one 
patient on a chart without checking the patient. The workers also 
complained of having little training. Another portion showed 
workers restraining a screaming girl who had not been informed she 
was being committed. 
</P>
<P>
	In arguing its case, CBS News officials said patient  
confidentiality was not compromised by the ``60 Minutes II'' report 
because the faces of those filmed were blurred and their voices 
altered. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite that, attorneys for the health system said several  
patients were worried they might be identified in the report. 
</P>
<P>
	``Simply blackening out their faces and disguising their voices  
won't prevent a patient's family and friends from recognizing that 
person,'' said Karen Popp, an attorney for Charter. ``Their 
identities will be exposed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Wester, another Charter attorney, said CBS committed a  
crime by using the hidden camera. He said the program also violated 
patients' privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no doubt that when an individual enters a psychiatric  
hospital, the events that occur are his or her private matters,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS attorney Lee Levine said the report needed to be broadcast  
because it raised important questions about the quality of care at 
psychiatric hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Graham Mullen expressed concerned that laws  
might have been broken in assembling the hidden-camera report, but 
said he had no choice but to deny the motion. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears to this court that the Supreme Court has elevated  
press powers to the point where prior restraint is all but 
impossible to obtain, even when the press sets out to commit a 
crime,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, the press is not free to commit a crime ... but  
even if they did, it does not give me the opportunity to shut it 
down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charter attorneys said they weren't sure if they would appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	The dispute with CBS comes two years after a North Carolina jury  
ordered ABC to pay $5.5 million for using the technique in an 
investigation of the Food Lion supermarkets. The award later was 
reduced to $315,000 and is still under appeal.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Comforts Colorado Community </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton struggled from 1,500 miles  
away Wednesday to ease the horror and sorrow of Columbine High 
School. Cabinet officials mobilized what help they could offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The president weighed making a visit to the Littleton, Colo.,  
community like those he made to Oklahoma City after the 1995 
bombing and in June to Oregon's Thurston High, the last school 
shooting to burst into national headlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of us are struggling to understand exactly what happened  
and why. There is a deep desire to comfort the grieving and counsel 
the children,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	By moving a work session with British Prime Minister Tony Blair,  
Clinton made room in his Thursday schedule to visit northern 
Virginia's T.C. Williams High School and hear students' concerns 
about school violence. Aides were looking at the president's 
schedule next week for a possible visit with the students, parents 
and teachers of suburban Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, as a gesture of respect  
for the community's grief, canceled appearances at political 
fund-raising events Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials were looking for an appropriate way for  
the president personally to comfort Littleton, press secretary Joe 
Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president wants to do what's best for the local  
community,'' Lockhart said. ``We are especially sensitive to not 
causing any disruption or distraction to the ongoing efforts 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Clinton said the relative calm in the day after the  
gunfire inside Columbine was a good time for parents everywhere to 
reassure children of their safety -- and ``to take this moment once 
again to hammer home to all the children of America that violence 
is wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also beseeched parents to ``ask what else they can do to  
shield our children from violent images and experiences that warp 
young perceptions and obscure the consequences of violence -- to 
show our children by the power of our own example how to resolve 
conflicts peacefully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president said nothing about guns or gun control.  
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said later that Clinton's support for tightly  
restricting youth access to guns is well known -- but not much was 
immediately known about the weapons used at Columbine. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a dozen federal agents from the Bureau of Alcohol,  
Tobacco and Firearms focused on tracing the arsenal -- two sawed-off 
shotguns, one handgun and one carbine, the White House said -- to 
determine who licensed them, and how and where the teen-age 
suspects got hold of such firepower. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must cut off teen-agers' easy access to guns and drugs and  
work to change a popular culture that glorifies violence and 
mayhem,'' Gore said in a speech at New York's Ellis Island. ``The 
world's eyes are upon us and our children's eyes are upon us too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from the departments of Education, Treasury, Justice  
and Health and Human Services and from the Federal Emergency 
Management Administration held a morning-after conference call on 
what aid they could give Jefferson County, where Columbine High is 
located. Education Secretary Richard Riley consulted the local 
school superintendent by phone. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno was to fly to Denver and meet  
privately Thursday with law enforcement officials and 
victim-services providers, said Justice Department spokesman Myron 
Marlin. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we must do now is learn from this tragedy and use the  
lessons to help prevent future tragedies,'' Reno said at a 
Minneapolis appearance Wednesday. ``Although it comes as little 
comfort at a time like this, we must remember that schools are 
still among the safest places for America's children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department officials said federally trained crisis  
counselors already based in Denver would most likely be deployed to 
help Columbine students and their families. 
</P>
<P>
	The team was put in place by Justice to assist victim families  
who traveled to Denver to observe the trials of Timothy McVeigh and 
Terry Nichols for bombing the Oklahoma City federal building in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the position of the federal government, we would  
acknowledge that there are limits to what we can do,'' Lockhart 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``But there certainly should be no limits to what we try to do.  
... We stand ready to move in as quickly as the local community 
deems appropriate.''

<HEADLINE> Corporate Mergers Could Speed Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A change in an obscure accounting rule is likely  
to result in a new surge in corporate mergers over the next 19 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	In a decision aimed at helping investors understand the impact  
of corporate takeovers, the Financial Accounting Standards Board 
voted Wednesday to eliminate ``pooling of interests,'' an 
accounting tool used in such recent mergers as the combination of 
Chrysler and Daimler-Benz and the union of Citicorp with Travelers 
Group. 
</P>
<P>
	The action is expected to accelerate corporate takeovers as  
companies race to find partners before the accounting change takes 
effect Jan. 1, 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would expect there will be a flurry of deals,'' said John  
Bishop, a partner at PriceWaterhouseCoopers. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine of the 10 largest acquisitions last year were classified as  
pooling of interests, according to Securities Data Co. Only AT&AMP;T's 
deal with Tele-Communications was tallied under ``purchase 
accounting'' rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite its popularity, pooling accounting has earned some vocal  
critics, among them Texaco, General Motors and International 
Business Machines. 
</P>
<P>
	When two companies merge under the pooling method, they simply  
add their balance sheets together, line by line. 
</P>
<P>
	While it sounds easy, opponents of the rule argue the method  
hurts investors for several reasons: Companies tend to be generous 
in paying for their targets and don't disclose the premiums they 
pay for the assets being acquired. What's more, the companies can't 
sell off assets or buy back stock for two years after the 
acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	``With pooling, an investor has a hard time telling what  
actually happened in the transaction, because you're not seeing 
what the company actually paid,'' said Deborah Harrington, a 
spokeswoman for the Financial Accounting Standards Board. By 
contrast, ``In a purchase (transaction), the investor has a whole 
lot more information about the deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's decision, a major step in a process that will be  
completed next year, will require all mergers to be accounted for 
as a straightforward purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	In purchase accounting, the buying company must treat the  
acquired company as an investment, and any premium paid over the 
value of the assets is carried on the buyer's balance sheet as 
``goodwill,'' and must be written off against earnings over several 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling would be a blow to companies like Yahoo! and America  
Online, which are buying companies with their high-flying stocks, 
and are loathe to do anything that will hurt their earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new rules, for example, Yahoo!'s $6.2 billion stock  
acquisition of Broadcast.com might look a lot less attractive. 
Yahoo!, an Internet search engine, is paying a hefty premium for 
Broadcast.com, a provider of TV and audio on the Web, which has yet 
to turn a profit. If Yahoo! had to write off the premium against 
its earnings, it too might be in the red. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to both Yahoo! and AOL were not immediately returned.  
</P>
<P>
	The Financial Accounting Standards Board will publish the  
proposed rule at the end of July, and while it will take public 
comment, the organization isn't expected to waver. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's decision was unanimous,'' Harrington said.

<HEADLINE> Romania Signs $500M IMF Loan Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- Romania's government and the  
International Monetary Fund reached a preliminary agreement 
Wednesday for a $500 million loan to ease the country's steep 
economic decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Romania desperately needs the money because it has $2.8 billion  
in foreign debt to repay this year. 
</P>
<P>
	With the loan, the government hopes to reduce imports and cut  
inflation, Prime Minister Radu Vasile said. 
</P>
<P>
	The national currency, the leu, has depreciated about 27 percent  
this year. The average national monthly salary is $81. 
</P>
<P>
	Trade unions are threatening a general strike next Monday to  
protest falling living standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The board of the IMF will consider the agreement in June, said  
Emanuel Zervoudakis, the bank's chief negotiator for Romania. If 
approved, the loan will be released in quarterly installments over 
11 months.

<HEADLINE> Court Sides With Customs on Pants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today limited a specialized  
federal court's power to second-guess Customs Service 
determinations on import fees, in a dispute over pants given a 
wrinkle-free treatment in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	In a victory for the Clinton administration, the justices said  
the U.S. Court of International Trade overstepped its authority 
when ruling that the pants could be reimported to this country 
duty-free. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade court must defer to Customs Service regulations so  
long as they are a reasonable interpretation of law, the justices 
ruled unanimously. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole point of regulations such as these ... is to ensure  
that the statute is applied in a consistent and proper manner,'' 
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the court. ``Deference to an 
agency's expertise in construing a statutory command is not 
inconsistent with reaching a correct decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haggar Apparel Co. sells pants that are assembled in Mexico from  
U.S.-made fabric and ``oven-baked'' to make them wrinkle-free 
before being shipped back to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Under federal tariff laws, an importer does not have to pay a  
fee for items assembled abroad from U.S.-made parts. But if 
improvements more significant than cleaning or painting are made, 
the fee exemption generally does not apply. 
</P>
<P>
	Customs Service officials, interpreting Treasury Department  
rules written to enforce the tariff laws, said Haggar's 
wrinkle-free processing made the pants ineligible for the 
import-fee exemption. 
</P>
<P>
	Haggar, based in Dallas, paid the duties under protest in 1988  
and 1989, and sued the government in the Court of International 
Trade, which ordered the government to refund the money. The trade 
court ruled that the wrinkle-free treatment did not warrant denial 
of the exemption, and that ruling was upheld by a federal appeals 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyers then sought the Supreme Court's help,  
contending the lower courts failed to give the Customs Service's 
determination the deference it was due. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the nation's highest court set aside the lower court  
rulings and said those courts must defer to reasonable Customs 
Service regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the main part of the ruling was unanimous, the justices  
disagreed on how to resolve the Haggar case. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven justices ordered the case returned to a lower court to  
determine whether the disputed regulation was a reasonable 
interpretation of the law and therefore warranted deference by the 
international trade court. Joining Kennedy were Chief Justice 
William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin 
Scalia, David H. Souter, Clarence Thomas and Stephen G. Breyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Justices John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented  
from that part of the ruling. They said the court should have 
upheld the regulation as reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is U.S. vs. Haggar Apparel Co., 97-2044.

<HEADLINE> Judge Orders Texas Girl Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- A 14-year-old girl in state custody since  
1996 for the beating death of a toddler was released Wednesday, a 
week after her conviction was overturned by an appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
	State District Judge John Dietz ruled Wednesday that Lacresha  
Murray be placed in her grandparents' custody under strict 
supervision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy to be home with my family,'' said Lacresha, still  
wearing her orange jumpsuit from the Giddings State School when she 
walked into her grandparents' living room. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacresha has been in state custody since she was charged with  
capital murder at age 11 -- the youngest person in Texas to face 
such a charge. After two trials, she eventually was convicted of 
injury to a child and sentenced to 25 years for the beating death 
of toddler Jayla Belton. 
</P>
<P>
	Jayla died May 24, 1996, of massive internal injuries after  
spending the day in the home Lacresha shared with her grandparents 
and five brothers and sisters. The family often baby-sat for Jayla 
and other children. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the 3rd District Court of Appeals remanded Lacresha's  
case to juvenile court, throwing out the conviction after finding 
the statement she gave police was obtained illegally and should not 
have been used at her trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant prosecutor Rosemary Lehmberg, first assistant district  
attorney, said prosecutors would almost certainly seek 
reconsideration of the reversal before the appellate court or ask 
the Supreme Court to look at it. 
</P>
<P>
	If needed, the case almost certainly will be retried, she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Dietz's ruling came despite a plea for caution from Jayla's  
mother, Judy Shaw, who urged the judge to ``protect the safety of 
our community,'' and testimony from a caseworker at the Texas Youth 
Commission facility who said Lacresha had become more disruptive 
while in custody. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't find Lacresha is a flight risk,'' said Dietz, who has  
presided over both of her trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacresha cannot be around children under 10 without supervision,  
she cannot leave Travis County without the court's permission and 
she must attend school in an alternative setting.

<HEADLINE>  NATO Seeks To Undermine Milosevic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After four weeks of gradually escalated  
airstrikes, NATO is moving from strictly military targets to ones 
aimed at undermining President Slobodan Milosevic's political 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	This was evident in NATO's attack Wednesday morning on a  
Belgrade building that housed the offices of Milosevic's ruling 
Socialist Party of Serbia, as well as transmitters for TV and radio 
stations owned by Milosevic's daughter, and other business and 
party offices of people close to Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	British Defense Secretary George Robertson called the Belgrade  
target a ``nerve center'' of Milosevic's power structure. ``We are 
now striking at the very heart of his bloodstained regime,'' 
Robertson said in London. 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-story building is just one example of NATO's intent to  
intensify pressure on Milosevic to accept the Western alliance's 
demands for an end to the violence in Kosovo and the safe return of 
ethnic Albanian refugees, alliance spokesman Jamie Shea said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shea said he thought the attack ``will have certainly been a  
powerful reminder to him of the fact that there is no sanctuary for 
any aspect of his power structure as long as he continues to defy 
the international community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is NATO's calculation that threatening Milosevic's  
instruments of power -- his political base, including control of 
Serb media -- is the best hope for breaching his threshold for pain 
and breaking his will to resist. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts disagree and fear this approach will backfire.  
</P>
<P>
	``If anything, it will only stiffen his resolve,'' Robert Gates,  
a former CIA director, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Daily bombing of military targets throughout Serbia since March  
24 so far has failed to end the repression of ethnic Albanians in 
the province or to produce signs that Milosevic will bend. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton presaged this latest move up NATO's list of  
strategic targets when he said last week that the air campaign was 
moving to the ``next level.'' He added, ``Ultimately, Mr. Milosevic 
will have to choose, either to cut his mounting losses or lose his 
ability to maintain his grip on Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Army Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,  
has been more explicit. 
</P>
<P>
	At a hearing Wednesday before the House Appropriations  
subcommittee on defense, he showed a color-coded chart depicting 
three phases of the air campaign, beginning with attacks on Serb 
air defenses that are meant to ``set conditions,'' or establish 
NATO's ability to conduct strikes when and where it desires. 
</P>
<P>
	The second phase, designed to isolate Serb military forces,  
targeted rail and road networks, fuel production and storage and 
facilities that enable Milosevic to command and communicate with 
his armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
	With those two goals partly accomplished, NATO's third phase is  
intended to ``decimate'' Milosevic's forces in Kosovo, Shelton 
said, and to break the back of his political support. 
</P>
<P>
	In his public remarks, Shelton said the targets in this third  
and final phase are classified secret. But other officials said the 
political party offices and broadcasting facilities hit Wednesday 
fall in this category. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied missiles Wednesday also hit a radio and TV transmission  
tower on Mount Fruska Gora outside Novi Sad, Serbia's 
second-largest city. NATO had struggled with an internal debate 
over whether to attack broadcasting facilities, which are not 
strictly a military target. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, the top NATO commander, apparently  
carried the day with his argument in favor of such strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Apache helicopters that began arriving in Albania on  
Wednesday are not intended for strategic targets, but they play an 
important role in tactical strikes on Milosevic's forces inside 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, the new focus on higher-value strategic targets and  
the addition of tank-killing Apache helicopters mark an 
intensification of military pressure NATO hopes to keep up for 
weeks or months. 
</P>
<P>
	As planned from the start of the air war, targets hit in the  
earliest stages remain under attack. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, NATO planes are far from finished attacking air  
defense sites such as surface-to-air missile batteries, radars and 
the communications facilities than enable the air defenses to 
operate together. Some of these have been hit, repaired by the 
Serbs and then attacked again. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, NATO is keeping up its assault on fuel, ammunition and  
other supply lines into Kosovo.

strategic targets when he said last week that the air campaign was 
moving to the ``next level.'' He added, ``Ultimately, Mr. Milosevic 
will have to choose, either to cut his mounting losses or lose his 
ability to maintain his grip on Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Army Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,  
has been more explicit. 
</P>
<P>
	At a hearing Wednesday before the House Appropriations  
subcommittee on defense, he showed a color-coded chart depicting 
three phases of the air campaign, beginning with attacks on Serb 
air defenses that are meant to ``set conditions,'' or establish 
NATO's ability to conduct strikes when and where it desires. 
</P>
<P>
	The second phase, designed to isolate Serb military forces,  
targeted rail and road networks, fuel production and storage and 
facilities that enable Milosevic to command and communicate with 
his armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
	With those two goals partly accomplished, NATO's third phase is  
intended to ``decimate'' Milosevic's forces in Kosovo, Shelton 
said, and to break the back of his political support. 
</P>
<P>
	In his public remarks, Shelton said the targets in this third  
and final phase are classified secret. But other officials said the 
political party offices and broadcasting facilities hit Wednesday 
fall in this category. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied missiles Wednesday also hit a radio and TV transmission  
tower on Mount Fruska Gora outside Novi Sad, Serbia's 
second-largest city. NATO had struggled with an internal debate 
over whether to attack broadcasting facilities, which are not 
strictly a military target. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, the top NATO commander, apparently  
carried the day with his argument in favor of such strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Apache helicopters that began arriving in Albania on  
Wednesday are not intended for strategic targets, but they play an 
important role in tactical strikes on Milosevic's forces inside 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, the new focus on higher-value strategic targets and  
the addition of tank-killing Apache helicopters mark an 
intensification of military pressure NATO hopes to keep up for 
weeks or months. 
</P>
<P>
	As planned from the start of the air war, targets hit in the  
earliest stages remain under attack. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, NATO planes are far from finished attacking air  
defense sites such as surface-to-air missile batteries, radars and 
the communications facilities than enable the air defenses to 
operate together. Some of these have been hit, repaired by the 
Serbs and then attacked again. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, NATO is keeping up its assault on fuel, ammunition and  
other supply lines into Kosovo.

	SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Colombia (AP) -- Leftist guerrillas  
Wednesday demanded the ouster of a Roman Catholic priest from a 
rebel-controlled region where government and rebel negotiators held 
a second day of peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, accused  
Rev. Miguel Angel Serna of being an army collaborator who has 
incited parishioners against the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	Serna is one of several clergymen to speak out against a  
government decision to withdraw police and soldiers from five 
southern towns as a concession to facilitate peace talks with the 
FARC. 
</P>
<P>
	Rev. Hector Lopez, the Catholic bishop whose diocese includes  
most of the zone, says the FARC has forcibly recruited children, 
stolen cattle, charged businesses ``war taxes'' and made adults 
particpate in military training in the 16,200 square-mile area. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement read Wednesday by a rebel spokesman, the FARC  
said Rev. Serna had ``used the pulpit'' to persuade his 
parishioners to appeal for a return of the troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Serna, 39, said he had no intentions of abandoning his parish.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Just days after one former Mexican  
president's son announced he would run for president in 2000, the 
son of another ex-president has said he, too, would accept a 
candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Miguel Aleman -- governor of the Gulf coast state of Veracruz and  
son of a former president of the same name -- said Tuesday he would 
accept the candidacy if nominated'' by the ruling party. 
</P>
<P>
	It followed a Saturday announcement by Mexico City Mayor  
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, son of former president Lazaro Cardenas, that 
he would seek the presidential nomination of the center-left 
Democratic Revolution Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico's political elite has long been known as the  
``Revolutionary Family'' because many members are sons or relatives 
of presidents who served after Mexico's 1910 Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	All presidents since 1929 have belonged to the ruling  
Institutional Revolutionary Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Former President Miguel Aleman's 1946-1952 administration was  
marked by widespread corruption. Lazaro Cardenas' 1934-1940 term is 
remembered for its ambitious social programs and the 1938 
nationalization of the oil industry.

	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- A high-speed train system will  
connect Argentina's capital with one of the country's premier 
coastal resorts under a project announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Buenos Aires Gov. Eduardo Duhalde said the $600-million project  
to link Buenos Aires with Mar del Plata, 250 miles south of the 
capital, should be completed within five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The new train will travel 100 mph and reduce the travel time by  
two hours to the popular summer vacation spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Duhalde said the German firm Adtranz, Siemens and Ferrostaal  
will design the new railway.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A Mexican salt company's plan to build a new  
plant in a protected lagoon area in Baja California could endanger 
whale calves born in those waters, a traditional breeding area for 
gray whales, environmentalists said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenpeace representative Juan Carlos Cantu told a congressional  
committee the proposed $100 million plant would bring increased 
ship traffic, and that boat propellers could kill whale calves. He 
showed a video of one whale being killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico's congress is investigating the ESSA salt company, a  
joint venture between Japan's Mitsubishi Corp. and the Mexican 
government, which has been accused of killing dozens of whales and 
hundreds of sea turtles with brine discharges. 
</P>
<P>
	The company makes salt by evaporating seawater in salt flats  
near the ocean. Brine -- extremely salty water -- is a byproduct. 
</P>
<P>
	ESSA, which has denied any wrongdoing, is planning to build a  
new salt evaporation plant in the San Ignacio lagoon that is part 
of the El Vizcaino Biosphere Reserve, which was declared a U.N. 
World Heritage Site in 1994.

	Rebels of the National Liberation Army, or ELN, commandeered the  
twin-engine turboprop April 12 and forced it to land on a remote 
jungle airstrip. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to address an impassioned appeal to the kidnappers so  
that they stop this unjust act against these people, whose rights 
have been gravely violated, and free them,'' John Paul said in 
Spanish during his weekly general audience in St. Peter's Square.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Some students tried to hold classes Wednesday  
despite the second day of a student strike at Latin America's 
largest public university. 
</P>
<P>
	Student groups have vowed to strike until college officials  
revoke last month's hike, which raised annual fees from 2 cents to 
about $145. The increases ended the state-run school's virtually 
free status. 
</P>
<P>
	The main buildings at the 268,000-student National Autonomous  
University were closed down Tuesday by student protesters, and the 
holdout Law School was forcibly shuttered later in the day, over 
the objections of faculty and some students. 
</P>
<P>
	But classes continued at about a half dozen of the university's  
dozens of academic units, including the Schools of Medicine, 
Veterinary Medicine, Engineering and Accounting. 
</P>
<P>
	Students long have fought against any increase in fees, which  
had been frozen since 1948, arguing that the Mexican constitution 
guarantees the right to free education in state-run schools.

<HEADLINE> Online Gardening Gets Mixed Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	POUND RIDGE, N.Y. (AP) -- In gardening, as in many fields, the  
computer dramatically speeds up your search for information. As 
computers get cheaper and more people buy them, Web sites are 
proliferating. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike, say, an automobile, where computers actually run  
things, the electronic garden consists of just words and pictures 
on your screen. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't expect any miracles in the garden itself, not yet anyway.  
Tilling, sowing, transplanting, watering, weeding, harvesting, 
these chores you still do by hand or with the help of relatively 
primitive tools. Which, for some, is one of the joys of gardening. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Web sites are patently commercial and are trying to sell  
you flowers, plants or implements. But some are genuine search 
tools. 
</P>
<P>
	I went on the Internet for the first time this year to order  
garden seeds, curious to see how much faster, if at all, I would 
get them. In the back of my head, I nurture a dream that online 
ordering will help someday to reduce the flood of catalogs that 
swamp my mailbox and the recycling bin. 
</P>
<P>
	For the trial, I chose two nationally prominent seedhouses with  
whom I had long been dealing by mail or phone. In tune with the 
times, each now has an attractive Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	The first firm shipped out my seeds in just a few days, as fast  
as I could possibly want. It made no mistakes except for 
misspelling my address as ``Francher Road'' instead of ``Fancher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This misspelling appears on much of my mail, so I had to note  
sadly that the miracle of cyberspace didn't prevent the gremlins on 
the other end from inserting that unwanted ``r.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for the second order, when three weeks went by without my  
receiving anything, I took to the phone. This was an order for 
tomato seeds and time was getting short for me to start them 
indoors. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman in customer service who answered the phone said ``Oh''  
when I told her I had ordered online. But she asked for my 
confirmation number and when I gave it to her, she said, ``Such 
numbers don't exist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	I told her I was reading it off the confirmation message I  
received on the day I ordered. She then transferred me to what she 
called the electronics department, which promptly sent me back to 
customer service. 
</P>
<P>
	This time I was to ask for a designated person who would know  
all about online orders. This woman said such confirmation numbers 
did exist, but she couldn't find mine. Then she told me she would 
do some research and get back to me. Finally, I got voice mail 
saying the order had been found and would be shipped right away and 
apologizing for the delay. 
</P>
<P>
	Humans being error-prone, such foulups no doubt also occur with  
mail and phone orders. But evidently this company needs more time 
to get its act together for Web business. 
</P>
<P>
	Some attractive ads appear online, such as one from www.  
garden.com which calls itself ``the largest garden center on the 
Web.'' For instance, it offers you a pick from among five of the 
unfussiest orchids ``for a living bouquet that stays in bloom for 
months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Or, on the same site, you can go to the ``amaryllis grab bag''  
and pick three bulbs ``for just $9.99.'' 
</P>
<P>
	You get such offers in catalogs, too, of course. And it's up to  
you whether you ultimately prefer mailing, phoning, faxing or 
online ordering. 
</P>
<P>
	Where the computer really shines is in research, employing  
techniques that do in seconds what once would have taken hours, 
days or weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, a novice wanting help in creating a garden can get  
it quickly and abundantly by accessing the Web site of the 
nonprofit National Gardening Association at www. garden. org. 
</P>
<P>
	A home page shows on the screen with links to many aspects of  
gardening. Click on the button labeled ``plant finder.'' The 
program will then help you with all the fundamental requirements 
for raising a plant in the climate of your area, which you identify 
by your ZIP code. 
</P>
<P>
	If you just want to cast your net in the great sea of  
cyberspace, try one of the search engines like 
www.altavista.digital.com or www.yahoo.com. Who knows what'll show 
up? 
</P>
<P>
	Say you want to know about growing mistletoe. Ten options  
appeared on the screen when I submitted the query to altavista. 
</P>
<P>
	One led me to a ``dwarf mistletoe management guidebook.''  
</P>
<P>
	Another said, ``I saw mommy kissing Santa Claus.''  
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> AOL Contacts FBI Over H.S. Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- America Online has contacted the FBI and  
preserved content posted by its members in case any of it is tied 
to the Colorado school massacre, AOL said today. 
</P>
<P>
	However, there was no evidence that anyone had posted warnings  
before the rampage, an AOL spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Within hours after news of the carnage broke, messages  
proliferated in AOL ``member profiles'' by people purporting to be 
in the ``Trenchcoat Mafia'' in Littleton, Colo. One read: 
``Preparin' for the big april 20!! You'll all be sorry that day!'' 
At least one AOL member Web site bore a similar warning. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point we have no clear evidence that the people who  
were directly involved posted any kind of warnings,'' AOL 
spokeswoman Kim McCreery said this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	She added: ``We reached out to the FBI last night and we  
preserved any information we thought would be relevant to the 
investigation. We have not received a subpoena yet but (AOL 
officials) are reviewing that content.'' 
</P>
<P>
	FBI spokesman Bill Carter said today he was not aware of AOL's  
offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``In any of these types of cases, you'd want to know if this was  
a conspiracy,'' Carter said. ``But this is a local case being 
investigated by the sheriff's department. We've offered any 
assistance we can provide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another AOL spokeswoman, Tricia Primrose, noted that hoaxes are  
common in AOL member profiles after big news events. Early Tuesday 
evening, a search of the member profiles for ``Trench Coat Mafia'' 
turned up 22 hits; two hours later that increased to 29. 
</P>
<P>
	The profiles don't have timestamps that would show publicly when  
they were posted or updated, although computer administrators 
typically can review system logs to find that information. 
</P>
<P>
	Anyone with Internet access can perpetrate hoaxes with ease, and  
often with anonymity, as free e-mail services and trial accounts on 
services like AOL have become common. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet gossip Matt Drudge updated his Web site less than three  
hours after the shooting with the blaring headline: ``EXCLUSIVE: 
'TRENCHCOAT MAFIA' PLACED WARNING OF COMING SCHOOL MASSACRE ON 
AOL!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked Tuesday night what he did to confirm that the member  
profile had in fact been posted before the shootings, Drudge said 
at first: ``Nothing. I just pulled it off AOL with my own eyes. ... 
I think it's completely valid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later Drudge said he had called AOL's customer-support phone  
number but the person he was referred to wouldn't give him the 
identity of the AOL member who posted the purported warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Drudge said of AOL's action: ``It's now become a little  
more serious that the No. 1 online company has brought (the member 
profiles) to the attention of the FBI.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Technology commentator David Schenk said the Internet doesn't  
inherently encourage people to pull pranks, but it does act as a 
powerful microphone. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are probably 10- and 12-year-olds who understand that  
the more sick they are, the more outrageous they are, the more 
likely their voice will be heard,'' Schenk said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all the new AOL profiles claimed sympathy with the shooters,  
though. One posted by someone calling him or herself 
``ArcticVirus'' said: ``Death to the Trench Coat Mafia.''

<HEADLINE> Polygamy Goes on Trial in Utah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOGAN, Utah (AP) -- John Daniel Kingston is accused of beating  
his 16-year-old daughter when she fled an arranged marriage to his 
brother. But is child abuse the issue, or is bigamy? 
</P>
<P>
	Kingston's prosecutors say it's a simple case of abuse. Other  
observers say it's more: Kingston is a prominent member of one of 
Utah's best-known polygamous clans, and it will be impossible to 
ignore his lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection started today with 75 prospective panelists  
filling out questionnaires. Panelists who made it through an 
initial screening by 1st District Judge Ben Hadfield and attorneys 
for both sides were told to return in the afternoon for individual 
interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge cautioned members of the pool not to discuss the case  
with anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you that the prosecutor doesn't see it as a  
polygamy case, but the public does see it as a polygamy case,'' 
said Carmen Thompson, executive director of Tapestry of Polygamy, a 
group of former polygamous wives. 
</P>
<P>
	``They think all of us are guilty of child marriages. That's so  
far from the truth,'' said Owen Allred, leader of the 5,000-member 
polygamous group called the Corporation of the Presiding Elder of 
the Apostolic United Brethren. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl, now living in foster care, contends her 43-year-old  
father drove her to a family-owned farm near the Idaho border last 
May and whipped her for disobeying David Ortell Kingston, who had 
made her his 15th wife. 
</P>
<P>
	The wealthy South Salt Lake-based clan led by patriarch Merlin  
Kingston goes by the name of the ``Latter-day Church of Christ'' 
and has about 1,000 members. The brothers are the sons of the 
clan's late leader, who died in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Though polygamy is banned by the state constitution and  
denounced by the predominant Mormon church, the attorney general's 
office estimates there are 25,000 practitioners in Utah alone. 
</P>
<P>
	No large-scale bigamy cases have been prosecuted since the  
1950s, when agents raided Short Creek, a town established by 
polygamous families on the Utah-Arizona border. The incident 
backfired and the state backed off when the public became enraged 
by images of families being torn apart. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-polygamy groups say prosecutors should strike once more,  
adding bigamy to the existing cases against John Kingston and his 
brother, who is to be tried on an incest charge in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you see crimes stemming directly from the polygamy issue,  
the polygamy should be prosecuted,'' Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have thrown up their hands, saying it is difficult  
to prosecute bigamy, the only charge associated with plural 
marriage. Marriages are often performed in secret ceremonies, 
evidence can be skimpy or nonexistent, and prosecutors don't want 
to gamble time and resources while more pressing crimes demand 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the jury will understand this case has very little to  
do with polygamy and everything to do with child abuse,'' said 
Scott Wyatt, attorney for Cache County, where the trial is being 
held. 
</P>
<P>
	Others say that approach treats the symptoms, not the problem.  
</P>
<P>
	``To me, the underlying problem is the polygamous relationship  
that exists and they ought to be prosecuting that relationship, not 
just the child abuse,'' said Dexter Anderson, a Millard County 
prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson filed a bigamy charge last month against a man  
allegedly married to five women for several years. He said it is 
the sixth such case he has opened since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think (polygamy cases) should be any more difficult  
than any other kind of case,'' he said. ``To me, it's a law just 
like any other law and it's our sworn duty to prosecute 
violations.''

<HEADLINE> Settlement Reached in Bias Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A settlement was reached in a race discrimination  
lawsuit filed after a 9-year-old black boy who shared a white boy's 
snorkel at a suburban swimming pool was tested for the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union announced the  
settlement Wednesday but did not disclose the amount, which will go 
to the black child and his mother. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal lawsuit accused officials at Outreach Community  
Ministries, a Wheaton-based daycare provider, of pressuring the 
black boy's mother into having him tested for HIV and strep throat. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to charges of discrimination, the lawsuit alleged  
that Outreach Ministry and clinic officials broke state law by 
releasing the negative test results to the white boy's mother. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement released Wednesday, Outreach Ministries called  
the allegations inaccurate but said they settled the lawsuit ``out 
of concern for people involved.''

<HEADLINE> Only Tiniest Newborns at High Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The outlook for tiny newborns isn't as bleak as previously  
thought. 
</P>
<P>
	Among full-term babies, only the smallest 3 percent face a  
significantly increased risk of death or life-threatening illnesses 
in their first few weeks, a study published in Thursday's New 
England Journal of Medicine found. Obstetricians have long believed 
that the smallest 10 percent were in danger. 
</P>
<P>
	For premature babies, the study didn't find a clear cutoff  
point. But the risk of respiratory distress, life-threatening 
bloodstream infections, seizures and death increased the smaller 
and the more premature they were. 
</P>
<P>
	Babies at the 3 percent mark weighed 5 pounds, 13 ounces,  
compared with 7 pounds, 7 ounces, for the ``typical'' baby. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message for mothers is that it's really only the smallest,  
smallest of the babies that seem to be at greatest risk,'' said Dr. 
Steven L. Bloom, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at 
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Bloom and colleague Dr. Donald D. McIntire studied 82,361  
full-term babies and 12,317 preemies born at Dallas' Parkland 
Hospital from 1988 through mid-1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The smallest 3 percent of full-term babies were three times more  
likely to die and at least two times more likely to have major 
illnesses than average babies. Still, only three of every 1,000 of 
those tiniest babies died. 
</P>
<P>
	Among premature babies, problems were far more common among the  
``youngest'' babies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just how small you are,'' McIntire said. ``It's also  
how soon you are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Jonelle C. Rowe of the National Institute of Child Health  
and Human Development said the study will help obstetricians 
managing risky pregnancies.

<HEADLINE> HIV Mother Must Use Bottle To Feed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- An HIV-infected woman who wants to  
breast-feed her baby agreed to use a bottle and has been allowed to 
keep the boy, though he remains under state control. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathleen Tyson and her husband, David, have agreed to bottle  
feed their son and will not defy the judge's decision, Mrs. Tyson's 
attorney said after Tuesday's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both Kathleen and David have a lot of integrity,'' Hilary  
Billings said. ``They gave their word a long time ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Tysons lost legal custody of their 4-month-old son, Felix,  
when he was days old because of their decision to nurse. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of their case to win him back focused on their unorthodox  
beliefs, part of the national ``Rethinking AIDS'' movement, that 
HIV doesn't cause AIDS and that the deadly virus can't be spread by 
breast milk. 
</P>
<P>
	A string of medical experts testified for the state, however,  
that milk from an HIV-infected mother carries the highest risk of 
transmitting the virus -- even higher than sexual intercourse. 
</P>
<P>
	``The parents may choose to run that risk with the child, but  
the court may second-guess that decision,'' Juvenile Court Judge 
Maurice Merten said after the three-day hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple's case focused on clinical theories about how HIV  
doesn't really cause AIDS, and how the risk of an HIV-infected 
mother's breast milk is minimal. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a child was sitting on the hood of a car driving at 100  
mph, everyone would try to stop that car,'' Bernadette Healy, an 
attorney for the state, told the judge in her closing arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Robert Nagler, the state lawyer representing Felix: ``The  
mother has demonstrated ... that's she's not about to make the 
simple sacrifice of not breast feeding. The threat to Felix is 
immense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tyson, who was diagnosed with HIV during prenatal  
screening, began nursing Felix in the hospital and a doctor called 
in authorities. So far, Felix has tested negative for HIV. 
</P>
<P>
	Testifying as the final witness, Mrs. Tyson told the judge her  
decision to breast feed was ``all about what I want for my child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I love my son more than anything in the world and that I want  
the best for him,'' she said. ``There is a morass of information 
out there and I have tried to make the best judgment that I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the decision, the Tysons quickly left court without  
talking to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're disappointed,'' said Billings. ``I just don't think that  
the judge was willing to buck the tremendous tide of medical 
opinion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the state has legal custody of Felix, he is allowed to  
live with his parents and 10-year-old sister. A caseworker from 
Oregon's Office for Services to Children and Families visits about 
once a week to ensure he is being bottle-fed.

<HEADLINE> Compaq Meets Diminished Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Compaq Computer Corp. reported a $281 million  
first-quarter profit today that met its own recently diminished 
forecast, hurt by stiff price competition and slow sales of its 
most profitable business computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were released four days after the world's largest  
maker of personal computers forced out its chief executive to try 
to restore Compaq's credibility on Wall Street. A week earlier, the 
company had warned it would earn less than half the profit analysts 
had been expected for the quarter just ended. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite our overall corporate strength, our first-quarter  
results are disappointing and unacceptable,'' said Compaq chairman 
Ben Rosen, who has temporarily replaced ousted CEO Eckhard 
Pfeiffer, in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will aggressively pursue the actions necessary to realize  
our enormous potential, achieve our traditional levels of 
profitable growth, and build long-term shareholder value.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq's first-quarter results sharply exceeded its year-ago  
performance, but they were below what Wall Street had been 
expecting as recently as the beginning of April. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq warned April 9 that it would earn 15 cents a share on the  
$9.4 billion in revenue. The warning sent Compaq's shares 
plummeting 22 percent the following trading day. 
</P>
<P>
	The warning reflected the company's deep difficulty in competing  
against direct-seller Dell Computer Corp., boosting Internet sales 
and integrating its acquisition of Digital Equipment Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	In today's report, Compaq said it earned 16 cents a share, in  
the quarter ended March 31. That was up from a profit of $16 
million, or 1 cent a share, in the comparable period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues grew 66 percent to $9.42 billion from $5.69 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Compaq has had difficulty boosting sales of Alpha business  
computers made by Digital Equipment, the giant manufacturer it 
bought last year for $9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq's profit margins were battered by an on-going price war  
in personal computers sold to homes and businesses. And Compaq has 
stumbled in trying to emulate the more efficient sales model of 
arch rival Dell, which saves money by selling computers directly to 
customers, eliminating the markup charged by retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq gave few hints in its financial statement about its  
future performance. It did say it expects to boost profits from its 
services business, which helps businesses set up and run their 
computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The services business' sales met the company's internal sales  
forecasts.

<HEADLINE> Top Amateur Garcia Making Pro Debut  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- Sergio Garcia walked into his first news  
conference as a professional wearing a snappy suit with cameras 
clicking. The only thing missing Wednesday was a full-page 
newspaper advertisement that said, ``Hello, World.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Equipped with the most celebrated amateur career since Tiger  
Woods, the 19-year-old Spaniard who was the low amateur in the 
Masters makes his pro debut Thursday in the Peugeot Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a new page for me as a golfer, it's a new book.  
One that has no headings or records, the pages are still blank,'' 
Garcia said at the Golf Club of Prat. ``My move to professional 
golf will start from zero.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is the second European teen-ager in as many years to turn  
pro, only Garcia is expected to fare much better than Justin Rose. 
After his tie for fourth in the British Open last year, Rose 
immediately turned pro and hasn't made a cut in 18 tries. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia will be able to play seven European tour events this year  
to make enough money to avoid going to qualifying school. 
</P>
<P>
	He also is expected to use sponsor exemptions to play the Nelson  
Classic, the St. Jude Classic and the Sprint International on the 
PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never know what is going to happen,'' he said. ``But if I  
should win, it would be fantastic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That may sound like a big ambition. But then, the 19-year-old  
prodigy known as ``El Nino'' has always faced high expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	At 12, Garcia became the club champion at Mediterranean Golf  
Club, where is father is the pro. Two years later, he made the cut 
in his European PGA debut at the Mediterranean Open and became the 
youngest European Amateur Champion at 15. 
</P>
<P>
	He played his first British Open in 1996 and missed the cut at  
Royal Lytham and St. Annes. After the tournament, champion Tom 
Lehman handed Garcia the claret jug and told him, ``Someday you 
will win this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia won his first professional event at 17, the Catalonia  
Open on the Spanish PGA Tour. After winning the British Amateur 
last year, he came to American and finished third in a Nike Tour 
event in Greensboro, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The Peugeot Open is a perfect place for Garcia to make his pro  
debut. He set the European record last year in this tournament for 
having the lowest score by an amateur, an 11-under 277. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I have the game to win here, but I'm going to take it  
calmly and just enjoy the play,'' Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Peugeot Open also marks the first tournament for Jose Maria  
Olazabal since he won the Masters two weeks ago. Olazabal thought 
Garcia made the right decision to turn pro. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Sergio is a special player, and he's a long hitter  
with a great short game. I think he'll do well,'' Olazabal said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best thing for him will be that people leave him alone,  
let him play as many tournaments as he can and get as much as 
experience as he can without people putting a lot of expectations 
on him,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods turned pro in 1996 after winning his third straight U.S.  
Amateur and signed endorsements with Nike and Titleist worth about 
$60 million over five years. He repeated the words in the newspaper 
ad -- ``Hello, world'' -- at his news conference, then proceeded to 
win two tournaments in and won two tournaments in his eight starts 
that year. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager and family adviser Jose Marquina said Garcia has  
agreements with Acushnet to play the Titleist driver, Titleist ball 
and Cobra irons, and with Adidas to wear its shoes and apparel. 
</P>
<P>
	Where Garcia goes from there starts on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> NFL Picks Los Angeles Coliseum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- When Michael Ovitz proposed bringing pro  
football back to the Coliseum several years ago, he got a cold 
shoulder from the NFL and was told to look for another site. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, after moving his act down the freeway to suburban Carson,  
the Hollywood deal-maker is back where he started. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz and his backers, who recently dropped their proposal to  
build a stadium in Carson, are engaged in a duel for the league's 
32nd franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	As expected, NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue announced Tuesday  
that the league intends to put a team in the Coliseum, with the 
stadium remodel and franchise price expected to reach $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Left hanging was the question of who would remodel the  
76-year-old stadium and own the franchise, a decision the NFL 
expects to make within 45 days or so. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Coliseum Partners, headed by developer Ed Roski, will  
provide the competition for Ovitz's group, with a possibility that 
other potential owners will emerge. 
</P>
<P>
	Roski has pushed the Coliseum for the past three years, but the  
NFL team owners didn't want to be locked into exclusive 
negotiations with one group, so they also kept Ovitz in the 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Four and one-half years ago, I came to the league when the  
teams left here and made a presentation for this (Coliseum) area 
for a combination stadium and new sports arena where the basketball 
and hockey teams would play,'' Ovitz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was suggested to me by several owners of the National  
Football League that they would never come back to the Coliseum and 
suggested we focus on somewhere else. They seemed to have changed 
their point of view on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The league owners voted 29-2 last month to award the expansion  
team to the Los Angeles area, the nation's second-biggest TV 
market, on a conditional basis. They set a Sept. 15 deadline for 
reaching agreement with whatever site and group they chose for the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Houston is waiting if a deal can't be reached in Los  
Angeles, comments by NFL officials and civic leaders Tuesday at the 
Coliseum appeared to solidify prospects LA actually will get the 
team, expected to begin play in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Roski seemed pleased after meeting with NFL officials and the 11  
team owners on hand for Tuesday's press conference at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've picked LA, they've picked the Coliseum, they're not  
going to have an auction, and they've given us some guidelines,'' 
Roski said. 
</P>
<P>
	He had thought the new franchise was going to go to the highest  
bidder, but Tagliabue instead said there would be a fixed price 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of all the things said today, I think that was one of the best  
things we could hear,'' Roski said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue said the aim was ``to make the new Coliseum a  
reality,'' and added, ``If we succeed in doing that, we will be 
talking about a project that will involve, in round numbers, $1 
billion of investment, in terms of the stadium, the Exposition Park 
area (site of the stadium) and the ownership of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are looking for business plans, including stadium designs  
and site development plans, within the next 30-45 days, which puts 
us before our league meetings on May 25-26,'' the commissioner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been speculation Roski and Ovitz would combine their  
efforts to get a team. 
</P>
<P>
	While Roski said Ovitz would be welcome to join the New Coliseum  
Partners, Ovitz said, ``I don't know anything about putting the 
groups together. I know what we've been charged with individually. 
We both had separate meetings (with NFL officials) this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``You clearly heard what the commissioner said, which is that he  
wants to focus on a business plan and a public-private partnership. 
They made the decision that they want to try to develop the 
Coliseum, and as far as I'm concerned, that's fantastic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue seemed to think the chance of other groups joining the  
franchise competition was remote, noting that Roski and Ovitz have 
a significant head start. 
</P>
<P>
	``(But) if other people with similar qualifications were to  
knock on my door or the mayor's or Mark's door, I think they ought 
to at least be heard,'' the commissioner said, referring to Mayor 
Richard Riordan and councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the price tag will be steep to bring a team back to the  
Coliseum, abandoned first by the Rams and then by the Raiders, 
taxpayers apparently won't be stuck with a big bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all understand the reality of taxes in California since  
someone named Jarvis came on the national scene,'' Tagliabue said, 
referring to Howard Jarvis, who began a successful grassroots 
movement to cut taxes in California years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``But by the same token,'' the commissioner continued, ``this  
has to be a public-private partnership in order to succeed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The historic Coliseum would be completely gutted inside and  
rebuilt under Roski's initial proposal, which might be modified 
now. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz recent proposal featured a shopping mall and stadium  
complex to be constructed on a former landfill in Carson, 12 miles 
south of the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL owners, however, apparently favored the Coliseum because  
of its proximity to downtown, which is undergoing a bit of a 
renaissance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coliseum was the centerpiece of the 1932 and 1984 Olympics,  
and also the site of the NFL's first Super Bowl. The Rams played 
there before moving first to Anaheim, then to St. Louis, and then 
the Raiders played there until returning to Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles area has been without a pro football team since  
the Rams and Raiders both left following the 1994 season. UCLA also 
was a Coliseum tenant before moving to the Rose Bowl, and the USC 
Trojans, whose campus is nearby, remain the stadium's lone tenant.

	Police Search Colo. School for Traps  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Worried about bombs and booby traps,  
specially trained officers painstakingly checked thousands of 
lockers and castoff backpacks today at Columbine High School, where 
15 people were killed in yesterday's rampage. Close to 30 explosive 
devices were found, including bombs in the parking lot and on the 
bodies of the gunmen. A sheriff's spokesman also said explosives 
were found in the suspects' vehicles and possibly at their homes. 
Meanwhile, students streamed into Clement Park next to the school 
early today to leave flowers and share their feelings about the 
shootings. And outside the Light of the World Church, visitors 
placed flowers and cards at the base of a cross.

	Shooting Comes Amid Colo. Gun Debate  
</P>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The shooting rampage at a suburban high school  
prompted state lawmakers today to kill major gun bills, including 
one that would have helped gun owners obtain concealed weapons 
permits. Local government leaders had criticized the concealed gun 
bill, already passed by the state Senate. A House panel had planned 
to take up the measure today, but action was postponed in the wake 
of the Littleton shootings and the sponsor later withdrew it.

	U.S. Will Accept Kosovo Refugees  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration today decided to  
allow Kosovo refugees to come to the United States for shelter 
rather than sending them to the U.S. military base in Guatanamo, 
Cuba. A White House official said details of the plan were not yet 
final, but that rather than attempt to house as many as 20,000 
refugees at any one site, relocation experts would place them with 
family members already living in America and with volunteers.

<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO missiles slammed into a  
high-rise building termed a ``nerve center'' of Slobodan 
Milosevic's ruling machine in a bold attack on the offices of 
Yugoslavia's hard-line governing party. With border clashes raising 
fears of an expanding Balkan war, the first of about 24 Apache 
anti-tank helicopters intended to improve NATO's ability to strike 
Yugoslav ground forces began arriving in Albania today. 
International monitors said two Kosovo Liberation Army fighters 
were killed and 18 wounded in a second straight day of heavy 
fighting with Serb forces near the Albanian border.

	Court Takes Up Disabled Care Suit  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supreme Court justices worried aloud today  
that mentally disabled people might be ``abandoned on the streets'' 
if an anti-bias law is judged to give them a broad right to live in 
homelike settings rather than state hospitals. The court was 
considering a Georgia case in which two women sued the state to get 
out of a mental hospital. The court is to decide by late June 
whether the Americans with Disabilities Act and a related 
regulation require community placement of the mentally disabled 
whenever appropriate.

	LONDON (AP) -- Telecom Italia SpA today formally accepted a

the world's second-largest telecommunications company. The merged

records for blacks and Hispanics. Nationally, 66.7 percent of 
American families owned the houses or apartments where they lived, 
the Census Bureau said. For non-Hispanic blacks, the January-March 
rate was a record 46.9 percent; for Hispanics, it was 46.2 percent. 
The rate for non-Hispanic whites was 72.8 percent.

	Colo. School Checked for Booby Traps  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- With 15 bodies still inside the school  
more than a day after the attack, bomb squad officers checked 
lockers and discarded backpacks for booby traps today as 
investigators tried to piece together the deadliest school massacre 
in U.S. history. Students identified the gunmen as Eric Harris and 
Dylan Klebold, members of a group that hated blacks, Some of the 
victims were found underneath desks, in cubicles or in boxes, slain 
while apparently trying to hide. Sixteen teens remain hospitalized, 
including five in critical condition and five others in serious 
condition.

	World Horrified by School Shooting  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Remembering 16 tiny coffins after a gunman opened  
fire in a Scottish school three years ago, Britain urged the United 
States today to respond to its deadliest school massacre by putting 
handguns out of reach. Britain imposed a near-total ban on handguns 
after Thomas Hamilton used four legally owned guns to kill 16 
kindergarten children and their teacher before killing himself in 
1996, in Dunblane. Many commentaries from around the world 
criticized the easy availability of guns in the United States. 
``How sick is the gun society of America?'' mused an article in the 
Yomiuri daily in Japan.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said  
today that a Serbian widening of the Balkans conflict into 
pro-Western Montenegro would have serious consequences. There are 
increasing reports that Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's 
forces are trying to evict from Montenegro many ethnic Albanians 
who had been forced to flee from Kosovo. Kosovo is a province of 
Serbia; Serbia and Montenegro comprise Yugoslav. Albright faced 
questions from members of the House International Relations 
Committee today about how the battle against Serb forces is being 
conducted but how much it will cost the United States.

	HOUSTON (AP) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic promised in  
an interview with a Houston TV station that the three American 
soldiers captured this month will be treated respectfully. 
``Nothing will happen to them,'' Milosevic said, according to 
KHOU-TV, which plans to broadcast excerpts of the interview 
tonight. So far, no outsiders have been allowed to see the three 
men. But Milosevic said Red Cross representatives can visit them, 
``not every day, but from time to time. I don't see that as a 
problem.''

dollars. The House approved the ``Ed-Flex'' bill 368-57, and the 
Senate then took it up. President Clinton was expected to sign it. 
Republicans, eager to show their commitment to education and other

<HEADLINE> Man Charged With 10 Church Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- An Indiana man charged with 10 church arsons  
could face the death penalty for a Georgia blaze that killed a 
volunteer firefighter. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal grand juries in Atlanta and Indianapolis on Tuesday  
indicted 36-year-old Jay Scott Ballinger, whom Indiana police say 
dabbled in satanic rituals. Ballinger is accused of seven church 
arsons in Indiana and three in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	It's unclear which state will try Ballinger first. But Georgia  
Fire Commissioner John Oxendine said Tuesday his state should get 
priority because of the fatal fire. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the most serious church fire of any in the United  
States because it was a murder, nothing more than a plain murder of 
a volunteer firefighter,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballinger, of Yorktown, Ind., was arrested in February in  
connection with an Ohio church fire that police say left him 
severely burned. He is being held without bond in a federal medical 
facility in Minnesota, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Deane, U.S. attorney for the northern district of  
Georgia, said federal prosecutors will decide whether to seek the 
death penalty. Otherwise, Ballinger would face a maximum prison 
sentence of 50 years in Georgia and 210 years in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballinger was charged with the most church fires of any  
individual in the three years that the National Church Arson Task 
Force has investigated 752 church fires and bombings nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The task force has charged 331 suspects in 249 attacks.  
</P>
<P>
	Racial motives were suspected as many of the initial fires were  
set at black churches. Acting Assistant Attorney General Bill Lann 
Lee in Washington observed that Ballinger ``is a white man charged 
with setting fire to predominantly white churches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ballinger has told federal agents that he burned 30 to 50  
churches in 11 states between 1994 and 1998, according to an 
affidavit by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The 
February affidavit said satanic materials were found in Ballinger's 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, parents complained Ballinger was recruiting teen-agers  
into a cult. Police confiscated from his home about 50 contracts 
signed in blood by teen-agers who agreed to give their souls to the 
devil and do ``all types of evil'' in exchange for wealth, power 
and sex.

<HEADLINE> Gymnastics Team To Beat Is Georgia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Most observers consider defending national  
champ Georgia the team to beat at the NCAA gymnastics 
championships. Bulldogs coach Suzanne Yoculan isn't among them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure we're the favorite here,'' Yoculan said. The meet  
begins tomorrow at the University of Utah's Huntsman Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a number of amazing teams here, and we haven't been  
at top strength this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A startling rash of injuries has even the normally brash coach  
worrying about her team's ability to repeat. Georgia is the 
nation's top-ranked team, but Sam Muhleman and Tayla Vexler, two 
important regular-season contributors, were hurt during the 
postseason and became the latest team members to go on the shelf. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Gym Dogs were rarely threatened during the regular  
meet season, running their winning streak to 57 matches. With its 
traditional depth eroded, Georgia must rely on mental toughness, 
which Yoculan said her team has in excess. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team is the strongest team mentally of any team I've  
coached,'' she said. ``These girls have continued to raise the 
bar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia posted a national-best 197.375 regional score two  
weekends ago in winning the Region 2 championship. To get to 
Friday's Super Six competition, Georgia must finish in the top 
three of Thursday's evening preliminary session. 
</P>
<P>
	Competing with the Bulldogs in that session will be  
highly-regarded Michigan, host Utah, Penn State, Nebraska and 
Florida, last year's runner-up. UCLA, the 1997 national champion, 
will compete in the afternoon session with Alabama, Stanford, West 
Virginia, Arizona State and LSU. 
</P>
<P>
	The top three teams in each session advance to Friday's finals,  
which determines the national champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's individual competition will determine the individual  
champs in vault, bars, beam and floor. The individual all-around 
champion is determined Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA is the team Yoculan expects to give Georgia its strongest  
competition. The Bruins are deep and experienced, and they breezed 
into the championships with the second-highest regional score in 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've never really been a favorite in this competition, so  
it's kind of a nice feeling,'' UCLA coach Valorie Kondos said. 
``For the first time since 1989, I have a team that doesn't have to 
have someone else miss for us to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Bruins have an injury problem of their own after their  
top all-arounder, Heidi Moneymaker, sprained both of her ankles 
during practice on Friday. Moneymaker has been undergoing intensive 
therapy, but isn't sure whether she will be able to compete. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Heidi, I like our chances. Without Heidi, we're not the  
same team we were in the regular season,'' Kondos said. 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA is peaking at just the right time. In its last two meets,  
the Pac-10 Championships and the NCAA Regionals, the Bruins have 
scored above 197 both times. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia, UCLA, Alabama and Utah are the only schools ever to win  
NCAA gymnastics titles, and all four have legitimate shots this 
year.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Accountability Bill Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans hope to curb the government's  
enthusiasm for new regulations with legislation that would force it 
to calculate how much the rules cost businesses and consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	The government would be required to report each year on the cost  
of red tape under a bill a House Government Reform subcommittee 
approved Tuesday. Its sponsors, Reps. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., and 
David McIntosh, R-Ind., said the measure would increase the federal 
government's accountability and improve the quality of regulatory 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans have a right to know the cumulative costs and  
benefits of federal regulation on these sectors and factors,'' 
McIntosh said. ``Current estimates of the off-budget compliance 
costs imposed on Americans by federal regulatory programs are close 
to $700 billion annually. ... Broken down, that's approximately 
$6,900 for a typical family of four.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The panel approved the bill by voice vote Tuesday over the  
objections of some Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, said the Clinton administration  
has joined labor, environmental, consumer protection and public 
health groups in opposing the bill because it could tie up already 
overburdened government agencies with work that may end up being of 
little value. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill ``would be costly and may cause paralysis by analysis  
and seriously hamper the work of federal government agencies, which 
are mandated to protect the public from adverse consequences and 
certain business practices,'' Kucinich said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, the bill puts too much emphasis on analyzing the  
impact on businesses and others subject to regulation and too 
little on the impact on the people regulations are designed to 
protect, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the bill, the Office of Management and Budget would be  
required to compile accounting statements on the costs of federal 
regulations. Accompanying reports would analyze the impact of 
regulations on the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
	McIntosh, the subcommittee chairman, said the bill should not  
``impose any undue burden on OMB, since much of the needed 
information is already available.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The subcommittee approved a Kucinich amendment that would have  
OMB also look at impacts on public health, public safety, the 
environment, consumer protection, equal opportunity and other 
policy goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., has introduced similar legislation  
in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 1074.

<HEADLINE> Compaq Meets Deflated Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Compaq Computer revealed the financial details  
of a weak first-quarter that led to the removal of its CEO, but 
still left Wall Street wondering why the company stumbled so badly 
and how it would get back on track. 
</P>
<P>
	Just days after the weekend ouster of chief executive Eckhard  
Pfeiffer, the world's biggest maker of personal computers posted a 
first-quarter profit of $281 million, or 16 cents a share, meeting 
newly diminished forecasts. That's less than half of what had been 
predicted as recently as two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The results reported early Wednesday actually represented a  
sharp improvement from the first quarter of 1998, when Compaq 
earned $16 million, or 1 cent a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, first-quarter revenues grew 66 percent from a year ago  
to $9.42 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	But with most observers still confused about why it took so long  
for the company to recognize that it would miss its own forecasts 
by such a wide margin, most were hoping for a better explanation of 
what went wrong and what was being done about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq, however, had little to say on either matter during a  
conference call Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decision to make a change in leadership was not  
precipitated by any single event,'' said Compaq's chairman, Ben 
Rosen, who is replacing Pfeiffer while the Houston-based company 
looks for a permanent successor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a combination of issues that were reflected in a  
performance that was below what the board thought was appropriate 
for the company, and the unanimous vote was that a change in 
leadership would change the fortunes of the company,'' he said, 
refusing to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosen, noting that ``we've been in office for only 48 hours,''  
was similarly vague as to the search for a new CEO or the direction 
of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want a person who can manage a technology company that is  
growing and complex,'' Rosen said. ``We think we can be a more 
efficient company. We think we can make decisions faster and get 
products to market sooner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Wednesday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Compaq's  
shares rose 25 cents to $24.25, more than 50 percent below where 
the stock peaked earlier this year. 

</P>
<P>
	Compaq, hurt by stiff price competition and slow sales of its  
most profitable business computers, disclosed on April 9 that its 
first-quarter profit was only about half as much as expected. The 
following trading day, its stock plunged 22 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The warning reflected the company's deep difficulty in competing  
against direct-seller Dell Computer Corp. and boosting sales over 
the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq also has had difficulty boosting sales of Alpha business  
computers made by Digital Equipment, the giant manufacturer it 
bought last year for $9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Profit margins, meanwhile, have been battered by an ongoing  
price war in personal computers sold to homes and businesses. 
Compaq has struggled to emulate the more efficient sales model of 
Dell, which saves money by selling computers directly to customers, 
eliminating the markup charged by retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq gave few hints in its financial statement about its  
future performance other than to say it expects to boost profits 
from its services business, which helps businesses set up and run 
their computer systems.

<HEADLINE>  Manchester United, Bayern in Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Manchester United and Bayern Munich will meet in  
the Champions Cup final in Barcelona after victories Wednesday over 
Juventus and Dynamo Kiev. 
</P>
<P>
	United conceded two goals by Filippo Inzaghi in the first 11  
minutes against Juventus in Turin and the Italian titlist looked 
set for its fourth Champions Cup final in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	But Alex Ferguson's team, held to a 1-1 tie at home in the first  
game of the series, got goals from Roy Keane, Dwight Yorke and Andy 
Cole for a 3-2 victory. It was Juventus' first loss at home in 
European competition in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	The result means there's no Italian team in the final for the  
first time since 1991 while United made it for the first time since 
1968. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very proud moment for me,'' said Ferguson, the United  
coach who has been with the club since 1986 and guided the team to 
a Cup Winners Cup triumph in 1991 and four league titles. 
</P>
<P>
	``My players were absolutely fantastic, they were magnificent.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bayern, a three-time winner but not since 1976, made the May 26  
final for the sixth time with a 1-0 victory over Kiev in Munich's 
Olympic stadium thanks to a spectacular solo goal by Mario Basler. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayern, which tied Kiev 3-3 in the first game, got the only goal  
of the second after 35 minutes. Basler danced round two Kiev 
players as he drove in from the left side and blasted a shot inside 
the far post. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayern, whose famous 1970s teams won the Cup three times in  
1974-1976, moved into the final for the first time since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayern remains on course to win a historic triple -- the  
Champions Cup, the Bundesliga title and the German Cup in the same 
season. United is after a similar triple in England, leading the 
Premier League standings and having gained the final of the FA Cup 
against Newcastle.

<HEADLINE> Nice Weather at Greensboro PGA Stop  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Players have already noticed a dramatic  
change from past years in this week's Greater Greensboro Chrysler 
Classic -- nice weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, unseasonably chilly temperatures and soggy conditions  
forced officials to enact the lift, clean and place rule for the 
first two rounds. In 1997, most of the tournament was played 
through rain that ranged from drizzle to torrential downpour. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember being here once when it was snowing,'' defending  
champion Trevor Dodds said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this week, players have been treated to sunny skies and  
temperatures approaching the 80s. 
</P>
<P>
	The balmy conditions are expected through the weekend and that  
means tougher scoring on the 7,062-yard layout at Forest Oaks 
Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
	``The golf course is in immaculate shape but it's more difficult  
than before in some aspects,'' Dodds said. ``You have to watch what 
you do off the tee because the rough is awfully punishing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The greens are firm, the fairways are rolling and the rough is  
plenty high,'' former British Open champion Tom Lehman said. ``If 
you shoot a low score, you've shot a heck of a round. Usually, when 
conditions get firm, scores go up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tiger Woods, David Duval, Fred Couples and Charlotte native  
Davis Love III are among the big names skipping the tournament 
which falls just two weeks after The Masters. Only eight of the 
tour's top 25 money winners are entered but that doesn't bother 
those who are here, including Jeff Maggert, the tour's No. 3 
earner. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just because Tiger Woods and David Duval aren't here, there's  
the perception that's a negative for the event. It's not a 
negative,'' Maggert said. ``The people in Greensboro love to come 
out here. They have great fans and great crowds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dodds defeated Scott Verplank on the first playoff hole last  
year, marking the second straight time and sixth time in 11 years 
in which the tournament needed extra holes to determine a champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Dodds hasn't won since and has struggled this season, missing  
six cuts in 11 starts. In his last three tournaments, he was 36th 
in the BellSouth Classic, missed the cut in the Masters and was 
70th in last week's MCI Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the poor results, Dodds says he's starting to improve  
his play. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been an up-and-down year, no question, but my game is on  
the way back,'' said Dodds, who returned to the PGA Tour last year 
after a bout with testicular cancer. ``Sometimes, when you take 
some steps back, you can feel when it's getting better. I've played 
some decent rounds and some poor rounds but I feel OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dodds said coming back to the site of his lone victory could  
help him shed his slump. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got some of the same feelings I had last year,'' Dodds  
said. ``It feels like coming home again.''

<HEADLINE> IMF: Global Economy Will Rebound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund says the worst  
may be over in the 20-month global financial crisis, but President 
Clinton is warning that this is no time for complacency. He is 
calling for international cooperation to overhaul the world's 
financial architecture. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton urged more efforts to reduce the vulnerability of  
nations to sudden decisions by investors to withdraw their money 
and he said the international lending agencies need to do a better 
job of protecting the poor when a crisis does strike. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a world of 24-hour markets, we will never be able to banish  
such crises altogether,'' Clinton told a gathering of economic 
officials at the White House on Tuesday. ``But acting on the 
lessons we have learned from this experience, we can find a way to 
harness the benefits of an open global economy while taming the 
global cycles of boom and bust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president discussed the broad principles that should govern  
efforts to overhaul the global financial architecture and said 
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin would unveil more detailed 
proposals in a speech today. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's efforts were being made in advance of the  
spring meetings of the 182-nation International Monetary Fund and 
its sister lending institution, the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States hoped to receive approval for its new ideas at  
a meeting Monday of finance officials of the world's seven richest 
industrial countries -- the United States, Japan, Germany, France, 
Britain, Italy and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus has said some of the  
ideas under discussion are ways to relieve crushing debt burdens 
being carried by the world's poorest countries. One idea is to sell 
some of the IMF's huge gold reserves and devote some of that money 
to debt forgiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton in his comments Tuesday repeated a proposal he made last  
month to get individual nations and international lenders to 
forgive $70 billion in debt. 
</P>
<P>
	While the U.S. economy has escaped significant harm from the  
global crisis that has pushed one-third of the world into 
recession, Clinton is coming under increased criticism because of 
America's rising trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	The government reported Tuesday that for the second consecutive  
month the U.S. trade deficit set a new record, climbing to $19.4 
billion in February as exports declined for a fourth consecutive 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	American manufacturing has lost 380,000 jobs over the past year  
and U.S. farmers are suffering through their worst times in a 
decade as the spreading global recessions cut sharply into U.S. 
export sales. 
</P>
<P>
	In its latest economic outlook, the IMF said the global economy  
should stabilize this year and enjoy a solid recovery in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	For 1999, the IMF's ``World Economic Outlook'' projected growth  
of 2.3 percent with a rebound to 3.4 percent next year as hard-hit 
economies begin to recover. 
</P>
<P>
	But for that recovery to be realized, the IMF said the United  
States will have to engineer a soft landing to slower but 
sustainable growth, Europe will have to rebound from a period of 
lackluster growth and Japan will have to find a way to end its 
worst recession in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	While the IMF reduced its forecast for growth in Latin America  
this year because of spreading recessions after the devaluation of 
Brazil's currency in January, that weakness was offset by an upward 
revision in the U.S. growth forecast, to 3.3 percent this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional and labor union critics of Clinton's free trade  
policies said the dramatic widening of the trade deficit in January 
and February pointed to a critical need for new policies to make 
sure U.S. jobs don't go overseas to low-wage nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We oppose an agenda that is headed down a low road to  
nowhere,'' AFL-CIO President John Sweeney said in a speech Tuesday 
in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists said the worse-than-expected February trade figures  
were likely to shave up to 2 full percentage points from the 
overall economic growth rate in the first three months of this 
year, but that would still leave the U.S. economy expanding at a 
healthy annual rate of around 4 percent.

<HEADLINE> U. Tenn. Sues Artist Over Trademark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The University of Tennessee has sued  
sports artist Alan Zuniga for more than $1 million for trademark 
infringement. Zuniga says he will defend his right to paint 
unfettered. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is a limited-edition print the Birmingham, Ala.,  
painter began selling in November commemorating Tennessee's 
football victory over Florida last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The print, called ``Victory -- At Last,'' is a montage of scenes  
from Tennessee's 20-17 overtime win. Running back Jamal Lewis, 
defensive tackle Darwin Walker and winning kicker Jeff Hall all are 
pictured. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if it represents a stepped-up enforcement or  
not,'' university lawyer Alice Woody said Tuesday of the lawsuit 
the university filed against Zuniga in federal court here Nov. 30. 
``It is a continuation of the efforts that we have made in the past 
to enforce the university's trademark rights and to receive 
royalties for the use of our name.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zuniga vowed in an interview Tuesday to fight the lawsuit. He  
said the issue is about defending his ``freedom as an artist to 
document sports history,'' not exploiting university logos. 
</P>
<P>
	``I try to put a lot of quality into it. I try to tell the story  
of the game,'' he said. ``I can see the need for licensing when it 
comes to a hat or a T-shirt. What I do is entirely different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 17-page lawsuit accuses Zuniga of trademark infringement,  
potential damage to UT's relationship with other Vols' vendors and 
endangering the NCAA eligibility of its athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	It's only the second time the university has gone to court to  
protect its trademarks on sports-related paraphernalia. Usually the 
threat of litigation is enough, university lawyers say. 
</P>
<P>
	Last April, the university sued Joseph K. McMillin for selling  
unauthorized Vols' T-shirts and other merchandise at his Cumberland 
Avenue store in the heart of the Knoxville campus. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he wouldn't stop until we got a court order, so we  
filed a lawsuit against him,'' said Beauchamp Brogan, the 
university's general counsel. ``He came in real fast and negotiated 
a settlement and got rid of his illegal contraband.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zuniga reached a similar settlement last year with UT after  
being warned about another football print called ``The Tennessee 
Rifles.'' The university ended up helping sell that picture through 
its Tennessee Traditions campus store. 
</P>
<P>
	But Zuniga said, ``I never gave up my rights as an artist when I  
agreed to do that deal. They convinced me that to let them try to 
sell it might be a marketing advantage to me. ... It didn't work 
out the way I hoped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The university contends it has trademarked virtually everything  
associated with its sports teams -- ``Vols,'' ``Volunteers'' and 
orange ``T's'' on everything from window stickers to glass mugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Royalties on sports-related merchandise, which is usually 7.5  
percent of gross sales, will reach more than $2 million this year 
for the university, said Sara Phillips, university licensing 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	But Zuniga contends the issue is broader for artists like  
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Under licensing, he said, ``They tell you not only what you have  
to pay in licensing fees, they tell you what you can paint, the 
subject matter. It is basically -- you do it their way or you don't 
do it at all.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Proposes Surplus Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress is moving ahead with legislation  
Republicans are billing as a first step toward rescuing Social 
Security, but the Clinton administration has threatened a veto. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate began debate Tuesday on strict new rules Republicans  
say are needed to stop lawmakers from spending government surpluses 
that come from Social Security payroll taxes, as opposed to income 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	If the money isn't used to prepare the retirement program for an  
onslaught of aging baby boomers, it would have to be used to reduce 
the national debt under the GOP plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal here is to lock this money up,'' said Senate Majority  
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. ``We want to make it as difficult as 
possible to breach that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Objections from the administration and Senate Democrats are  
expected to hold up any vote on the measure until at least 
Thursday, however. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's advisers at the White House Office of Management and  
Budget said in a statement Tuesday that the GOP measure would too 
tightly restrict the government's cash flow, especially in the 
event of ``any unanticipated slowdown in the economy.'' Treasury 
Secretary Robert Rubin first raised that concern last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said the  
Republican measure ``doesn't commit a nickel'' of expected income 
tax surpluses for Medicare, the health insurance program for the 
elderly. Republicans instead want to cut taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, the administration's statement said the GOP  
legislation ``fails to ensure that the surplus is used to protect 
the payment of benefits to Social Security beneficiaries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wants to try to give Social Security a tangible claim on  
the economic growth that would be expected to result from a lower 
national debt: IOUs that would give the program a claim on 
income-tax dollars after baby boomers retire. He also has called 
for government investment of some of Social Security's cash 
reserves in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans say Clinton's IOUs would be just paper promises that  
would have to be made good by taxpayers or borrowing in the future, 
and that the stock market investments would bring private financial 
markets under undue government influence. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders have yet to endorse any specific alternative for  
using the surpluses to benefit Social Security, but in both the 
House and Senate they are encouraging the development of plans by 
other influential Republican lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, is  
close to unveiling one such plan that would use the Social Security 
tax surpluses to finance personal accounts for workers to invest in 
the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	Those familiar with Archer's plan say the investment earnings  
would be substituted, on an individual basis, for traditional 
Social Security benefits, likely at something close to a 
dollar-for-dollar exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Republican Sens. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire and Rick  
Santorum of Pennsylvania, who Lott has picked to head a GOP task 
force, are collaborating with moderate Democrats on a plan 
combining similar personal accounts with upfront trimming of Social 
Security benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	But if Democrats and Republicans can't resolve their  
considerable differences and enact Social Security changes, the 
Republican bill being debated in the Senate this week would wall 
off Social Security surpluses for the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would require that the surpluses be used to pay off  
the government's debt to private bondholders. To ensure that 
happens, it would periodically lower the statutory limit on that 
public debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaching the declining debt limit would require agreement by 60  
senators -- more than a majority. The main exception would be for 
money used to enact Social Security reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Other exceptions would include national defense emergencies --  
such as the current conflict in Yugoslavia -- and a recession that 
held economic growth to less than 1 percent for at least six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republican leaders say they will bring similar legislation  
to the floor soon. A nonbinding version passed Congress as part of 
the GOP budget resolution last week, but actually putting the new 
spending restrictions into effect would require a change in law and 
Clinton's signature.

<HEADLINE> A Look at the 'Trenchcoat Mafia' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris hurled  
insults at Jews, blacks and Hispanics at Columbine High School. But 
they REALLY hated the athletes, who had power and popularity -- 
everything they didn't. 
</P>
<P>
	``All jocks stand up!'' one of the attackers yelled during their  
murderous spree Tuesday. ``We're going to kill every one of you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They killed 13 people in the deadliest school massacre in recent  
years. Then Klebold and Harris turned their guns on themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	As horrible as their assault on classmates was, it did not come  
out of the blue: Klebold, Harris and others in a band of outcasts 
who called themselves the Trenchcoat Mafia had a long-running feud 
with Columbine athletes, including a recent confrontation in which 
the ``mafiosi'' showed up carrying swords and brass knuckles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Trenchcoat Mafia was no secret society. Members posed for a  
yearbook photo last year. They had their own special spot in the 
cafeteria, near the stairs. They wore black trench coats -- no 
matter the season -- and berets with German crosses. They openly 
admired Hitler. They spoke constantly of war and guns, and Harris 
had made a video at school in which he bragged about his new guns. 
</P>
<P>
	After Paducah and Edinboro, Jonesboro and Springfield, how could  
such provocative behavior not raise alarm? 
</P>
<P>
	Rather easily, it turns out.  
</P>
<P>
	If fellow students at Columbine were concerned -- and some now  
say they were -- they said little to adults, figuring they could 
handle these troublesome misfits themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	If teachers and police noticed, they passed it off as teen-age  
rebellion, unpopular kids looking for a sense of belonging. 
</P>
<P>
	And if parents like Steve Cohn worried about their children's  
safety, they rested easy knowing that Columbine High was the nicest 
of schools in the nicest of areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We moved here 11 years ago because of the schools,'' Cohn  
said. ``It's been a great neighborhood. Until now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohn's son, Aaron, 15, narrowly escaped execution Tuesday. Lying  
on his stomach in the library, Aaron cowered as one of the masked 
gunmen leveled a shotgun at his head. A few moments earlier, a girl 
had jumped on Cohn's back, covering the baseball slogan on his 
shirt. The gunman moved on and chose another victim. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	A few weeks ago, the big news at Columbine High was pranksters  
putting Superglue in all the outside door locks. 
</P>
<P>
	Most cliques here would be familiar on any U.S. high school  
campus: band kids, nerds, stoners, skateboarders and, at the top of 
the pecking order, athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Harder to label were the dozen members of the Trenchcoat Mafia.  
Some fellow students described them as resembling ``Gothics,'' 
sharing a penchant for black clothes and ghoulish makeup. Their 
long black dusters fit the Gothic style, but also that of Old West 
villains. Members of the group simply said the coats kept them 
warm. 
</P>
<P>
	Their interest in Hitler and World War II was well-known around  
school. They played war games and bragged about their guns. Harris 
and Klebold sometimes spoke German in the hallways and made 
references to ``4-20,'' Hitler's birthday, said Aaron Cohn, who 
lives five doors down from the tidy, two-story home on a quiet 
cul-de-sac where Harris' family moved in a couple years ago. The 
massacre took place on Hitler's birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohn said Harris, 18, was nonetheless a quiet kid who hadn't  
caused him any problems in the past. Other neighbors echoed that. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a nice guy,'' said Matt Good, 16, who lives two doors  
away. ``Shy person, didn't say much. I'd see him walk from the car 
to the house, and that's about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harris' parents were nowhere in sight this week as reporters  
streamed past their home. Neighbors said they didn't know much 
about the family, except that the father was a retired military 
man. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris and Klebold were arrested last year for breaking into a  
car and completed their probation in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Klebold, 17, and other Trenchcoats had reputations for being  
smart and skilled at computers. Choir teacher Lee Andres remembers 
the 6-foot-4, blond Klebold as a smart kid. He ran the sound for 
one of last year's school musicals. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were extremely bright, but not good students,'' Andres  
told the Denver Rocky Mountain News. ``They disliked authority. 
They did not like to be told what to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By all accounts, they held a special hatred for athletes -- a  
contempt returned in good measure. John Duven said his teen-age 
son, a jock, almost got into a fight with them last year, but Duven 
talked him out of it. 
</P>
<P>
	The hostilities resurfaced this year.  
</P>
<P>
	``A couple of months ago, the jocks were supposed to fight  
them,'' said Good, a football player. They made a date to rumble: a 
Friday night at a baseball field. The jocks showed up, but the 
Trenchcoats were two hours late, and they went to the wrong spot, 
Good said. They also showed up carrying swords and brass knuckles -- 
not the jocks' idea of a clean fight. The rumble was never 
rescheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	``The jocks said forget it,'' Good said.  
</P>
<P>
	School officials said they'd had no discipline problems with  
Klebold or Harris, and they passed under the radar of the Jefferson 
County Sheriff's Department, said spokesman Steve Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	After the shooting, investigators questioned other members, but  
Davis said there was no indication other members took part in the 
actual shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Cohn finds it hard to believe that school authorities or  
police didn't notice the group. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wasn't it obvious, to someone?'' he asked. ``All the kids knew  
about it. You'd think a teacher would notice. You'd think the 
sheriff's department would know.''

</P>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- A kid in a white shirt heaved something  
up onto the high school roof, and it exploded in billowing smoke. 
Sophomore Don Arnold thought it was just a lunchtime prank, a 
firecracker maybe. 
</P>
<P>
	Then students started falling.  
</P>
<P>
	``One boy was running and suddenly his ankle just puffed up in  
blood,'' said the 16-year-old Arnold. ``A girl was running and her 
head popped open'' when a bullet slammed into her skull. 
</P>
<P>
	They were the first to be shot in Tuesday's bloody attack at  
Columbine High School outside Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnold's girlfriend, Lindsay Hamilton, 15, was inside the school  
reviewing for a biology test when she heard shots and explosions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good day to die!'' she said someone yelled at one  
point. ``We want everyone to die!'' 
</P>
<P>
	She and 30 other biology students holed up in the science room  
with their teacher for four hours while unspeakable tragedy 
unfolded outside. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack ended only when two suspects who had stalked through  
hallways spraying bullets apparently killed themselves in the 
school library just down the hall. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time Hamilton was reunited with Arnold -- after a SWAT  
team escorted her class around puddles of blood -- 15 people were 
dead, including the shooters. 
</P>
<P>
	Many students were in the cafeteria when the assault on  
Columbine High began. The first lunch shift started at 11:10 a.m. 
and was in full swing when food server Karen Nielsen heard someone 
yell, ``Get down!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen said she heard shots coming from outside and rushed to a  
window. She saw three victims outside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was on automatic,'' she said. ``It was just, 'get to the  
wounded.''' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the boys felled outside the cafeteria door had been shot  
in the face, another was shot in the back. The third looked dead. 
Nielsen ran back inside and called 911. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's deputies responded swiftly, but at least two hours  
ticked by before officers surrounded the building and moved in. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had initial people there right away, but we couldn't get  
in,'' Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone said. ``We were way 
outgunned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Students described their attackers as heavily armed -- with  
semiautomatic weapons and an assault rifle, some said -- and one 
student said one of the shooters took off his ankle-length black 
coat to reveal what appeared to be hand grenades. 
</P>
<P>
	When the attackers strode into the cafeteria, ``Everyone was  
trying to crawl at first, but then someone got up and ran, and 
everybody was running,'' said freshman Chris Donnelly, 15. ``I saw 
someone bleeding on the floor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearby, Nielsen was hiding with several other employees in the  
restroom of the teachers' lounge. They cringed when the attackers 
banged on other doors, shouting, ``We know you're in there,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Terrible moments passed. The shooting receded. One person  
ventured out hesitantly -- and saw wounded students strewn across 
the cafeteria. He returned to hiding in the lounge. 
</P>
<P>
	When Nielsen escaped about 90 minutes after the first shots, the  
two wounded students she'd seen were gone; the dead body was still 
there. According to students, the attackers next targeted the 
library, shooting as they walked up the stairs and down the hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Many hours later, after law officers had swept the school,  
checking every abandoned bookbag, backpack and gym satchel for 
explosives, the sheriff assessed the carnage on the second floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The library was one of the last rooms we entered, and it was  
the most gruesome,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Surrounding the bodies of the attackers, both juniors at  
Columbine, were the bodies of 10 of their victims. 
</P>
<P>
	SWAT teams began freeing clusters of panicked students and  
teachers from their hiding places about 2:30 p.m. Live television 
feeds showed them sprinting from the school, most with hands held 
high overhead, to holding areas where they were frisked, questioned 
and offered medical care. 
</P>
<P>
	Many survivors were reunited with anxious loved ones at a nearby  
elementary school. But it took a few more hand-wringing moments. 
Parents watched their precious children from a distance, but could 
not immediately speak with them or embrace them, while authorities 
finished their questioning on the school stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Other parents suffered a night of sinking desperation, their  
eyes scanning lists of students accounted for, either unharmed or 
in hospitals -- but not finding the names they love. 
</P>
<P>
	With the risk of rigged explosives deemed too high to continue  
their investigation overnight, authorities had no choice but to 
shut down the crime scene -- with bodies scattered throughout the 
Colorado high school.

<HEADLINE> Battle Arraigned on Assault Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Tony Battie of the Celtics pleaded innocent today  
at his arraignment on charges he dragged a police officer behind 
his car after the officer told him to move the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Battie was arrested around 2:20 a.m. Saturday in front of the  
Cosmopolitan Club near the FleetCenter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel he's done nothing wrong and the matter will be  
resolved through the appropriate judicial process,'' said Robert 
Keefe, Battie's lawyer, following the player's arraignment in 
Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Battie was asked several times by an officer to move  
his car, but refused. 
</P>
<P>
	Battie also was said by police to have refused the officer's  
request for proper identification and tried to drive off when the 
officer attempted to arrest him. 
</P>
<P>
	The officer's arm was caught in the driver's window and Battie  
stopped the car only after the officer drew his pistol, a police 
spokewoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Battie was accused of assault and battery with a dangerous  
weapon (the car), and refusing to identify himself to an officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Celtics spokesman Bob Prior said he saw no reason why Battie  
would not play tonight.

<HEADLINE> USOC Gets Help Securing Sponsorship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The U.S. Olympic Committee hired a private  
company on Wednesday to help corral corporate sponsors made wary by 
the bribery scandal surrounding the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We recognized that we had a very tall task and a long way to  
go'' in raising money in the wake of the scandal, Mitt Romney, 
president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If our coffers were full ... we wouldn't need to bring in  
another team member,'' he acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
	International Management Group is a sports marketing company  
that handled sponsorship sales for the 1992 Winter Games in 
Albertville, France, the 1994 Winter Games in Lillehammer, Norway, 
and the 1992 Summer Games in Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
	IMG has also represented numerous Olympic sponsors and sports  
personalities. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty much a been-there, done-that,'' said Robert  
Prazmark, IMG senior vice president of business development, who 
will spearhead the Olympic sales pitch. ``We've got a pretty deep 
Rolodex and we can get into pretty much any chairman's office or 
board room, and that's where this has to be sold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just one sponsor -- longtime Olympic backer Seiko -- has signed  
with the USOC since it was revealed that Salt Lake bid officials 
gave scholarships, lavish gifts, land deals, free trips and other 
perks to International Olympic Committee members and their families 
as the city tried to land the games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were way ahead of the curve ... and then I think the  
marketplace and the Olympic family have been distracted by the 
scandal,'' said John Krimsky Jr., president and CEO of OPUS, the 
USOC's marketing arm. ``We have to hit the ground running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said sponsors have committed to $530 million in  
contributions and in-kind services toward a goal of $859 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``OPUS is not out of time. They just lost their cushion of time  
and they just have to be flawless the rest of the way,'' Prazmark 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, companies are asking if the Olympic name has been tarnished  
by the scandal, whereas before, ``that question was never raised,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Prazmark said, the companies he has dealt with  
remain eager to help make the Olympics a success. 
</P>
<P>
	The marketing deal extends through 2004 and applies to the U.S.  
Olympic teams for the Sydney, Salt Lake and Athens games, although 
Krimsky said 80 percent of the money generated will go to stage the 
bribery-tainted Salt Lake Games. 
</P>
<P>
	IMG will be paid a commission for sponsors it brings to the  
USOC, but the officials refused to disclose the percentage the 
company would earn. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's far, far, far, far below industry standards,'' Prazmark  
said. ``It still has to be a business decision, but there's a lot 
of wanting to help out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said IMG had agreed to waive its commission for  
Utah-based sponsors. Also, the USOC has agreed to compensate the 
SLOC for commission payments until the $859 million target for 
sponsorship revenues is reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Prazmark said as many as 50 of the company's 2,000 staff members  
worldwide could work on the Olympic sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives us arms and legs we simply don't have today and it  
really gives us an opportunity to work with the premier sports'' 
marketing company in the business, Krimsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said OPUS will keep control over contract negotiations. IMG's  
chief duty will be to cultivate business contacts and bring them to 
the table for negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Parents Search for Their Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Parents thrilled to the arrival of each  
busload of students, praying their child would be among the 
survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	But the buses gradually stopped arriving, and the sounds of  
joyful reunions gradually gave way to parents asking desperately 
for news of their missing children. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a dream. We're trying to wake up. I wish I could  
wake up,'' said Michael Shoales, who waited Tuesday at Leawood 
Elementary School for information about his son. ``Things aren't 
looking good at all. If he could call, he would call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shoales and other parents gathered Tuesday at Leawood, which  
became a reunion point and a clearinghouse of information after the 
deadly shooting attack at Columbine High School a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
	After the buses stopped arriving, clergy members began meeting  
with families, and authorities simply told some to go home and wait 
until morning. Many refused. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're mixing with them and visiting and talking, giving them  
as much support as we can. There's a high level of anxiety inside 
the gymnasium tonight,'' said the Rev. Vic Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
	All the students brought to Leawood were taken to the side of  
the building and then paraded across a stage as their parents sat 
in the gym. Parents were unable to approach or touch their children 
until they were questioned by police. 
</P>
<P>
	Lists of all students known to be safe were plastered over  
posters announcing PTA events. Students, parents, counselors and 
school employees milled through the crowded halls. 
</P>
<P>
	Students leaving the gym were hugged; friends and family members  
cried out names and laughed. Others held onto each other, crying, 
when a new wave of children didn't include the ones they were 
looking for. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Bill Owens and counselors came to the school to try to  
comfort parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously the parents who found their children are happy. The  
other ones ... '' Owens said, his voice trailing off. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the high school, mourners left flowers and cards.  
</P>
<P>
	At the base of a small tree near the yellow police tape, two  
teens from Cherry Creek High School left bouquets and two dozen 
tulips. 
</P>
<P>
	Written inside a large card, propped at the base of the tree,  
were the words: ``These flowers are given to those whose lives were 
given today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sarah Bay, teary-eyed, sat in church, praying for a friend who  
was still missing hours after the shooting spree. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope that Rachel was not in there,'' Bay, 17, said of  
her classmate at Columbine. 
</P>
<P>
	But late Tuesday, no one was sure where Rachel was. Her family  
didn't know. Bay, who fled when the shooting began, said her friend 
wasn't listed at any of the hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	But as she huddled with others at a vigil at the Light of the  
World Catholic Church, Bay held out hope that the last survivor 
carried out of Columbine was her friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know it's selfish, but I just hope it was her,'' Bay said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Lipton Event May Get New Owner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Ericsson Open, known as the Lipton  
Championships during its 15-year rise into one of tennis' top 
tournaments outside the Grand Slam events, could get a new owner in 
addition to its new sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	International Management Group confirmed Wednesday it is  
negotiating to purchase ownership of the event from founder Butch 
Buchholz, but gave no further details. 
</P>
<P>
	``Negotiations certainly are going on,'' IMG spokeswoman Linda  
Dozoretz said. ``We'll have to leave it to Butch Buchholz to 
officially make any announcement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to the tournament, speaking on the condition of  
anonymity, also confirmed the talks. Buchholz was not immediately 
available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchholz and other officials of the Key Biscayne event are in  
Monte Carlo, site of this week's tournament, to accept an ATP Tour 
award honoring The Lipton as the men's tour's 1998 Tournament of 
the Year. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchholz, a member of the ATP's tournament council, also is  
attending meetings to revamp the tour's marketing strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Buchholz's guidance, the tournament has grown from  
year-to-year uncertainty into the only event outside the Grand 
Slams which features both men's and women's competition. The Lipton 
played its first three years at different sites until settling in 
Key Biscayne. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, The Lipton offered $4.775 million in prize money and  
drew record crowds approaching 250,000. The event is in the sixth 
year of a 30-year lease with Miami-Dade County at its Crandon Park 
site, which features a $20 million stadium that seats 14,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Lipton did not renew its affiliation, Buchholz recently  
struck a five-year deal with Ericsson Mobile Phones to take over as 
title sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	If a sale goes through, The Ericsson would be the fourth tennis  
tournament owned by IMG, as well as its largest. 
</P>
<P>
	IMG owns two women's events -- the Bank of the West Classic in  
Stanford, Calif., and the Acura Classic in Los Angeles. It also 
owns the men's tour stop in Philadelphia, currently on hiatus from 
the ATP Tour calendar. 
</P>
<P>
	IMG also is a part-owner of the Evert Cup, a women's event in  
Indian Wells, Calif.

<HEADLINE> Cell Phones Play Role in Tragedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- In the middle of the deadly rampage at Columbine  
High School, Kammi Vest hid in a closet and called her mother on a 
cellular telephone to tell her she was safe. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was whispering; she was calling to let her parents know  
she was OK. That was about all she could say,'' Kristie Vest said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	For Mrs. Vest, the phone was a godsend; other parents had to  
wait for hours to learn whether their children were among those 
injured or killed at the suburban Denver school. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting -- and the lifeline the phones provided to some  
students and parents -- have prompted some school officials to 
examine the bans they have against the devices. 
</P>
<P>
	Kammi Vest, 18, called her mother while hiding in a choir room  
with as many as 60 other students. They had blockaded the door with 
filing cabinets and hid under choir robes. 
</P>
<P>
	With two cellular phones, the students first called police and  
then phoned their parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a relief that they were OK for the moment,'' said  
Mrs. Vest. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Carlson, spokeswoman for Adams County School District 12  
in north Denver, said the fact that students were able to call 
authorities for help ``may well motivate a conversation in our 
district.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many districts like Adams County forbid cellular phones as  
disruptive, despite the wishes of some parents who say phones and 
beepers can be effective safety tools. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban began as a safety measure because it was believed that  
students might use their phones or beepers for drug dealing, said 
Carlson. 
</P>
<P>
	But the increased popularity of the devices has forced the St.  
Vrain Valley School District in Boulder County to consider 
eliminating its ban on phones and beepers. 
</P>
<P>
	``(The devices have) become far more acceptable in our society  
and far more acceptable as a communications tool between parents 
and kids,'' said Jack Hay, assistant superintendent for St. Vrain 
Valley schools. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the district originally imposed a ban in 1994 because  
officials believed students were using the devices to engage in 
illegal behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Hay said a new proposal would allow students to carry pagers or  
cellular phones but maintain restrictions on how they are used. 
</P>
<P>
	Other districts are also grappling with the issue.  
</P>
<P>
	``How do we have an environment that's focussed on learning and  
let kids be in touch with their families?'' asked Boulder Valley 
Schools spokeswoman Barbara Taylor. ``We don't have enough staff to 
take messages.''

<HEADLINE> Moody's: Japan's Banking Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The steady parade of credit-rating downgrades  
for Japanese banks is over -- at least for now -- and most banks 
should keep their current ratings, Moody's Investors Service said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government rescue of the Japanese banking system has  
finally begun in earnest, it appears coherent and well-conceived, 
and a full-blown banking crisis will be avoided,'' said Christopher 
Mahoney, managing director for sovereigns and banks at Moody's in a 
report on the Japanese banking system. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahoney said, however, that despite the recent infusion of funds  
by the Japanese government, radical restructuring of the industry 
likely is still necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, a government panel approved a $62.5 billion bailout  
package for 15 of Japan's largest banks to help payoff bad loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's banks are saddled with soured loans estimated to total  
at least $583 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The bad-loan cleanup, using taxpayer money, is the cornerstone  
of a government plan to pull the country out of its worst recession 
since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on downgrades over the past several years, the average  
bank financial strength rating issued by Moody's is D, with the 
larger banks averaging an E+ or E. The average in the other G-7 
countries -- Canada, Germany, France, Italy, the United Kingdom and 
the United States -- is C, with A being the higher rating. 
</P>
<P>
	Upgrades of Japanese banks' credit ratings are unlikely in the  
intermediate term because their ratings are ultimately tied to 
earnings, McCarthy added. ``The outlook for earnings is poor with 
heavy credit costs absorbing most of their earnings, delaying the 
accumulation of capital.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fundamentally, ``banks profits won't rebound until the Japanese  
economy starts growing again and interest rates rise,'' says 
Moody's banking analyst and senior vice president Ryan O'Connell.

<HEADLINE> Reno: U.S. Must Learn From Shootings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno said Wednesday  
that the nation should learn from the school massacre in Colorado 
and use it to prevent such tragedies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let us take that tragedy and do everything we can to prevent  
it in the future,'' Reno said. ``We have a great opportunity right 
now. We can say we do not have to accept this. We can have a 
lasting and permanent impact on violence across America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen people, including the two gunmen, were killed in  
Tuesday's shooting rampage at Columbine High School in Littleton, 
Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at a national symposium on reducing crime, Reno said  
she may push for more counselors in the nation's schools to solve 
problems before they spin out of control. 
</P>
<P>
	The only way to curb violence in schools is to give children the  
support they need and to train authorities to spot youngsters with 
potential problems, Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to be supportive and realize that it's terribly  
difficult to grow up in this country today,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack Tuesday was the latest in a series of school  
shootings around the country since 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department worked with the Education Department and  
experts last year to compile an ``early warning'' guide to help 
head off attacks. Reno said the guide will be redistributed.

<HEADLINE> Computer Show Glimpses at Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The baby has grown up. The spring Comdex show --  
once viewed as the lesser sibling of the massive fall showcase of 
new computer and electronic products -- has come into its own. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the week, the show offered participants a glimpse of  
competing operating systems that will take computers into the next 
century. On Wednesday, the Comdex show took a look at the future of 
an even broader topic: the ``Webification'' of America. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Internet and intranets breaking down the walls that  
isolate computers and their users, show exhibitors and industry 
executives urged companies to move more quickly to embrace the 
benefits and judge the risks of the online world. 
</P>
<P>
	``Make no mistake about it -- the rules of the last millennium  
will not apply to those who attempt to survive in the new 
millennium,'' said Rick Roscitt, president of AT&AMP;T Solutions and 
one of the show's keynote speakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Roscitt said companies that succeed must be able to think beyond  
the brick-and-mortar walls of the past to a world where consumers 
will use the Internet to seek services far beyond buying books, 
clothing or music. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, customers are doing things at a distance, 24 hours a day,  
on a plane or from home or a hotel, accessing services in real 
time,'' he said. ``The Internet has exploded their expectations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One critical component of meeting those expectations is ensuring  
that business can be conducted safely, reliably and easily as 
possible. Several exhibitors suggested that devices that scan body 
parts -- biometrics -- will become more and more important to the 
business community. 
</P>
<P>
	Saflink's SaftyLatch was made for the user who wants to avoid  
memorizing dozens of passwords or wants to walk away from a 
computer without worrying about prying eyes reading files. 
</P>
<P>
	The $60 application, compatible with Windows technology, allows  
the user's voice to be compared with a previously recorded speech 
sample before certain files can be accessed. 
</P>
<P>
	``My voice is my password,'' company product manager Andrew  
Halls says in getting the program to open a file that previously 
had resisted all attempts at access. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly exciting and futuristic, but it's also very  
practical,'' Halls said. ``Folks are starting to want protection, 
but not want to deal with yet another password. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tampa, Fla., company also touted products that recognize  
users through fingerprints and facial characteristics 
identification. 
</P>
<P>
	And for those cyberjunkies who might tire of even telling a  
computer who you are, IriScan of Marlton, N.J., makes a device that 
does just what the company's name implies: It scans the iris of a 
user's eye and creates a digital file for continual comparisons.

	Kelly Gates, the company's director of marketing, said the  
device is more accurate at identifying a person than DNA testing 
and takes far less time. 
</P>
<P>
	During demonstrations at the show, the camera and application

	The system, selling for about $4,000, has undergone testing at a  
bank in the United Kingdom since April and currently is being 
evaluated by prisons, businesses and large banks in the United 
States for use at automated teller machines, Ms. Gates said. For 
individual computers, the company later this year will offer a 
similar version for less than $1,000.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Close Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Stock prices fell sharply Wednesday in Tokyo  
following a gloomy assessment of the Japanese economy by the 
International Monetary Fund. The U.S. dollar was higher against the 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 202.09 points,  
or 1.21 percent, to close the day at 16,495.02 -- a two-week low. On 
Tuesday, the index gained 22.90 points, or 0.14 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 118.58 yen, up 0.54 yen from late Tuesday in  
Tokyo but slightly below its late New York level of 118.78 yen 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices fell after the IMF cast doubt  
on a swift economic recovery in Japan in its World Economic Report 
released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF revised downward its forecast for Japan's gross domestic  
product to minus 1.4 percent from a December prediction of a 0.5 
percent decline. 
</P>
<P>
	``It underlines the fact that things are not improving as much  
as people expected,'' said Robert Sasaki, head of the quantitative 
strategy group at Jardine Fleming Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was also pushed lower by futures-led hedge selling  
and profit-taking in international blue chips, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
exchange's first section was down 17.14 points, or 1.29 percent, to 
1,311.76. The TOPIX lost 3.79 points, or 0.28 percent, the previous 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was  
estimated at 492.4 million shares, down from 636.52 million shares 
Tuesday. Retreats overwhelmed advances 894 to 303, while 126 issues 
were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The brokerage sector was the biggest loser Wednesday, falling  
4.4 percent on a sharp decline in trading volume and profit-taking 
after recent strong gains. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average  
finished at 10,448.55 points, up 8.02. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar maintained much of its overnight  
strength in New York as the IMF's report deflated confidence in the 
Japanese economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent warnings by Japanese finance officials against the yen's  
excessive strength also sparked speculation that the nation's 
central bank might intervene to curb the yen's increase, 
discouraging yen-buying, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other major currencies, the euro was traded at 125.97 yen, up  
from 125.57 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 211 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.490 percent from Tuesday's close of 1.500 percent, 
driving its price up to 102.73 yen from 102.64 yen.

<HEADLINE> Knicks Boot Team President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PURCHASE, N.Y. (AP) -- New York Knicks president and general  
manager Ernie Grunfeld took the fall today for his team's poor 
season when he was reassigned within the organization and stripped 
of his power. 
</P>
<P>
	Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts will be the  
team's de facto general manager for the final eight games of the 
regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks (21-21) are in danger of missing the playoffs for the  
first time in over a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement of Grunfeld's reassignment came after the  
Knicks held a 2 1/2 hour practice. The team was quickly spirited away 
to a team meeting at which Checketts told them of the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough because Ernie doesn't play. He doesn't go out there  
in the shirts and sneakers to perform. It's a tough business,'' 
guard Chris Childs said. ``I feel bad for him, his family and 
everybody. It's tough to pinpoint him as the guy who is the reason 
why we're not winning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shakeup came after Checketts put Grunfeld and coach Jeff Van  
Gundy on notice that ownership was not satisfied with the team's 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks have been inconsistent all season, often breaking  
down in the fourth quarter and unable to blend well with several 
new players. 
</P>
<P>
	Those acquisitions were made by Grunfeld, who had been the  
team's general manager and president since 1996. He's been in the 
team's front office since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Grunfeld traded the team's most popular player, Charles Oakley,  
to Toronto for Marcus Camby. He also traded John Starks, Chris 
Mills and Terry Cummings to Golden State for Latrell Sprewell. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell and Camby have not fit in with the Knicks, and both are  
unhappy in their roles coming off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if there would be any changes to the starting lineup  
Friday night against Charlotte, Van Gundy said: ``I don't know. 
We'll see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks are on a four-game losing streak, their longest of  
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Grunfeld's new title will be special assistant to Checketts,  
Madison Square Garden spokesman Barry Watkins said.

<HEADLINE> Bryan Adams Likes To Keep Young </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bryan Adams has always approached his career  
with a ``T-shirt and jeans sensibility,'' retaining a kinship with 
his audience. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think rock 'n' roll does keep you young,'' Adams said. ``I  
meet people from school all the time. The guy is bald, has a 
paunch, two kids and a wife. That could be me. He looks 50. We're 
38. I've managed to elude the paunch. I like to swim and ride a 
bicycle. When I come to New York, I have it sent here. That's how I 
travel in London, where I live, or I walk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adams has sold 55 million albums since he began recording nearly  
20 years ago. He has a big catalog of hits, including ``(Everything 
I Do) I Do It for You,'' ``All for Love'' with Sting and Rod 
Stewart, and ``Can't Stop This Thing We Started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Run to You'' and ``Summer of '69'' are from his ``teen idol''  
period. As he has matured, Adams has gone on to ``social 
conscious'' songs, using ``Tears Are Not Enough'' to raise $2.5 
million for the Northern Lights Society for African Relief. 
</P>
<P>
	His favorite recordings are the best sellers. ``They become  
favorites because they did so well,'' Adams said. ``I like the 
songs everyone else likes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not every song has been a hit. ``I Want To Be Your Underwear,''  
the single from his last album, ``was a stiff in sales,'' Adams 
said. ``It did nothing. I thought it had a sense of humor. It 
offended all sorts of people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's nothing remotely like it on his new 13-song CD, ``Bryan  
Adams: On a Day Like Today,'' released by A&AMP;M. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are various themes on this record -- freedom, trust,  
infidelity, immortality and love,'' the Canadian rocker said. 
``These themes occur in people's minds all the time. They have in 
mine. There are never any answers. You have to wander through the 
day and see what happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Writing about such topics is cathartic, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's also kind of an exorcism. You're able to get a lot of  
things out of your system you don't ordinarily say. Guys don't 
talk. Women love to talk. I know I've been able to get a lot of 
things out of my system just by writing them down. I think when you 
write things down, it's almost like therapy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One duet on the CD is a hurting song, ``When You're Gone,'' sung  
with Sporty Spice, who is billed as Melanie C. Another song, 
``Fearless,'' is about cheating. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked, ``How do you get through it and over it?'' Adams  
responded by repeating the question. ``I don't know. Not that I 
should. I'm just a musician.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adams has been praised and criticized as a writer of simple  
songs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It isn't an aim to write simple,'' he said. ``I wish I'd  
written 'Volare.' It's played every day in every Italian restaurant 
in the world. I'm basically caged by my abilities. I have no 
musical education. I fly by the seat of my pants. I've been taught 
by the people I've worked with. My whole career has been trial and 
error.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adams worked with Gretchen Peters, who writes country songs, for  
seven of the songs on the new CD. 
</P>
<P>
	``A song can start from a title or a groove. It doesn't matter  
where it comes from as long as you get there in the end,'' he said. 
``I've never tried to write complex songs. I don't know how to. I 
had complex chord structures in 'We're Going To Win.' It was 
uptempo and was difficult to sing and play. I never played it right 
once, live. The studio is more forgiving. You can make an error and 
fix it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But I'm getting to the point I'm not so precious about things  
as I used to be,'' he continued. ``After making 'Unplugged,' which 
took one and a half years, I thought, 'Why am I spending a year and 
a half in the studio? I'd rather be doing other things.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Adams has won many awards, the only two he displays are  
his Ivor Novello awards -- named for a Welsh actor-composer -- which 
he won for ``(Everything I Do) I Do It for You'' and ``Have You 
Ever Really Loved a Woman?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Does celebrity bring a certain visibility?  
</P>
<P>
	Not really.  
</P>
<P>
	When he walks around London and New York, ``I get spotted by  
doormen more than by anybody else. They say, `Hey, Bryan, what's 
happening?' or `Yo, Adams.'''

<HEADLINE> Borders CEO Resigns, Stock Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Borders Group Inc.'s chief executive resigned  
from the nation's No. 2 bookstore chain on Wednesday, departing as 
the company struggles to keep pace with rivals Barnes &AMP; Noble and 
Amazon.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Borders also announced a shakeup in its top ranks, naming new  
presidents to head its mall-based Waldenbooks chain and its online 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ann Arbor, Mich.-based company's stock fell $2.50, or nearly  
15 percent, to $14.56 1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange on the news. 
The stock was also under pressure amid concerns that the bookstore 
chain's first-quarter profits may fall shy of Wall Street analysts' 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	After just five months on the job, Philip M. Pfeffer resigned as  
CEO and as a director at the company. Robert DiRomualdo, Borders 
current chairman and former CEO, will take the titles of president 
and CEO for now. 
</P>
<P>
	The company declined to comment on why Pfeffer, who was  
president and chief operating officer of Random House until 1996, 
was leaving. DiRomualdo said the company would begin a national 
search for a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	While Borders earned $92 million last year on sales of $2.3  
billion, it has struggled to keep up with brick-and-mortar rival 
Barnes &AMP; Noble and Internet giant Amazon.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfeffer told The Ann Arbor News in January that Borders' annual  
earnings were less than they should have been because stores 
weren't performing as well as they should. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not believe that we delivered to our customers a  
compelling indication that they should shop in Borders stores,'' 
Pfeffer said. ``We were not as focused as we should be in selling 
in our stores and marketing our programs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Dave Ricci of William Blair &AMP; Co. said the company also  
had trouble meeting sales targets. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Borders said its retail stores would post a profit  
of 4 to 5 cents per share for the quarter, while Borders.com would 
lose 5 to 6 cents per share. The company also said Pfeffer's 
departure would cost 4 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said that they had anticipated slightly stronger growth  
at the retail stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Other management changes announced Wednesday include the  
appointment of Kathy Winkelhaus to president of Borders Group 
Stores, a new position. Ronald Staffieri has been named to replace 
Ms. Winkelhaus as president of Waldenbooks. 
</P>
<P>
	Cedric Vanzura has been named President of Borders Online. He  
previously served as senior vice president of electronic commerce 
and fulfillment services. 
</P>
<P>
	A company spokesman said those moves were unrelated to Pfeffer's  
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	Borders was founded in 1971 in Ann Arbor as a used book store.  
It now owns 250 Borders superstores and 900 Waldenbooks stores.

<HEADLINE> Games Stop When Tragedy Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The postponement of baseball and hockey in Denver for two days  
because of the high school shootings in Littleton, Colo., is the 
latest example of sports responding to tragedy by calling off 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the best example came in November 1963, when President  
John F. Kennedy was assassinated. Three NBA games were postponed on 
Friday, Nov. 22, the day the president was shot. The league resumed 
play on Saturday with two games. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the day before the president's funeral, the fledgling  
American Football League scrapped its schedule of five games and 
the NHL postponed a game at Boston. The established NFL, however, 
went ahead and played in a decision that was widely criticized. 
Years later, commissioner Pete Rozelle called it the worst move he 
made in running the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other hockey games were called off in Toronto because of the  
deaths of prominent figures. On Feb. 6, 1952, the NHL game between 
the New York Rangers and Maple Leafs was postponed because of the 
death of England's King George VI. On Oct. 13, 1971, after Stafford 
Smythe, president of the Maple Leafs, died, Toronto's game against 
Boston was rescheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL was forced to abandon the 1919 Stanley Cup championship  
series between the Montreal Canadiens and Seattle Metropolitans 
because of a flu epidemic that killed 30 million people worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The final series was tied at 2-2 when it was called off after  
five Montreal players and team manager George Kennedy became ill. 
One of the players, Joe Hall, died four days later. It remains the 
only time in organized hockey history that the season ended without 
the Cup being awarded. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA has lost more games than any other league because of  
outside events. 
</P>
<P>
	On Nov. 9, 1965, a blackout that left much of the Northeast  
without power, forced the New York Knicks to call off their game 
against the Boston Celtics. The Northridge earthquake in Los 
Angeles damaged the Sports Arena and caused the Jan. 17, 1994, game 
between the Clippers and New York Knicks to be postponed for 10 
days and moved to Anaheim. The Clippers' Jan. 21 home game against 
the Lakers was switched to the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
	Race riots in the streets of Miami postponed the Heat's home  
game against Phoenix on Jan. 17, 1989. Three years later, on April 
30, 1992, similar riots in Los Angeles disrupted the league's 
playoff schedule. The first-round game between the Clippers and 
Utah Jazz, scheduled for that night, was postponed three days and 
moved to Anaheim, and the Portland-LA Lakers game, set for May 1, 
was delayed two days and moved to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Those same riots caused the Los Angeles Dodgers to postpone four  
home games, three against Montreal and one against Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years ago, following the bombing of the federal building in  
Oklahoma City, the city's minor league baseball team called off its 
game and then offered free admissions for the next two days. When a 
memorial service was held for the victims of the bombing four days 
later, the Tulsa team postponed its game. 
</P>
<P>
	The April 2, 1996, Opening Day game between the Montreal Expos  
and the Cincinnati Reds was postponed when umpire John McSherry 
collapsed and died of a heart attack at home plate in the first 
inning in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	The California League's Rancho Cucamonga franchise stopped a  
game on April 6, 1996, when relief pitcher Matt LaChappa suffered a 
heart attack and collapsed while warming up in the bullpen. The 
team also called off its game the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 25, 1992, Hurricane Andrew swept across South Florida.  
Two weeks later as the area began rebuilding from the storm's 
devastation, the Miami Dolphins postponed their home opener against 
New England, rescheduling it for October.

<HEADLINE> Man Charged With 10 Church Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- An Indiana man charged with 10 church arsons  
could face the death penalty for a Georgia blaze that killed a 
volunteer firefighter. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal grand juries in Atlanta and Indianapolis on Tuesday  
indicted 36-year-old Jay Scott Ballinger, whom Indiana police say 
dabbled in satanic rituals. Ballinger is accused of seven church 
arsons in Indiana and three in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials in Washington said they were unsure where they  
would try Ballinger first. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia Fire Commissioner John Oxendine said Tuesday his state  
should get priority because of the fatal fire. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the most serious church fire of any in the United  
States because it was a murder, nothing more than a plain murder of 
a volunteer firefighter,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballinger, of Yorktown, Ind., was arrested in February in  
connection with an Ohio church fire that police say left him 
severely burned. He is being held without bond in a federal medical 
facility in Minnesota, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Deane, U.S. attorney for the northern district of  
Georgia, said federal prosecutors will decide whether to seek the 
death penalty. Otherwise, Ballinger would face a maximum prison 
sentence of 50 years in Georgia and 210 years in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballinger was charged with the most church fires of any  
individual in the three years that the National Church Arson Task 
Force has investigated 752 church fires and bombings nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The task force has charged 331 suspects in 249 attacks.  
</P>
<P>
	Racial motives were suspected as many of the initial fires were  
set at black churches. Acting Assistant Attorney General Bill Lann 
Lee in Washington observed that Ballinger ``is a white man charged 
with setting fire to predominantly white churches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ballinger has told federal agents that he burned 30 to 50  
churches in 11 states between 1994 and 1998, according to an 
affidavit by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The 
February affidavit said satanic materials were found in Ballinger's 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, parents complained Ballinger was recruiting teen-agers  
into a cult. Police confiscated from his home about 50 contracts 
signed in blood by teen-agers who agreed to give their souls to the 
devil and do ``all types of evil'' in exchange for wealth, power 
and sex.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Welcomes East Timor Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary-General Kofi Annan welcomed an  
agreement Wednesday to end the violence in East Timor, saying its 
full implementation is of ``paramount importance'' to efforts to 
bring a permanent peace to the disputed territory. 
</P>
<P>
	The signing of the broadly worded peace deal came hours before  
the resumption of a critical round of talks at the United Nations 
that officials hope will lead to agreement this week on an autonomy 
proposal for East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	Violence has escalated in the former Portuguese colony since  
January, when Indonesia made a surprise announcement that it would 
grant East Timor independence if its 800,000 people rejected an 
autonomy offer. Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it 
within weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. officials charged with organizing a vote on the autonomy  
proposal have repeatedly expressed concern about the surge in 
violence, warning it could threaten the balloting. 
</P>
<P>
	But last week, the U.N. special representative for East Timor,  
Jamsheed Marker, said he intended to proceed with a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of rival groups in East Timor, along with military and  
government officials, hastily signed a peace pledge Wednesday in an 
effort to curb the unrest. 
</P>
<P>
	The initiative came from local police and military commanders --  
who are widely distrusted by separatist activists -- and did not 
address the issue of disarming pro-Indonesian militiamen and 
separatist rebels. It was not clear whether the armed groups would 
heed the call. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the secretary-general and the Portuguese welcomed  
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Annan ``is confident that the implementation of such an  
agreement, both in spirit and on the ground, will be of paramount 
importance to the negotiations under his auspices and the overall 
peace process,'' said U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it's a positive step,'' Portugal's U.N. Ambassador  
Fernando Neves said. ``It makes more clear that the Indonesian 
armed forces are responsible for maintaining security in the 
territory, and we hope they'll stick by that agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neves spoke to reporters before holding talks with Marker on the  
60-point autonomy plan. The U.N. envoy met Wednesday with 
Indonesian envoy Nugroho Wisnumurti, and Neves was scheduled to 
join them later for three-way talks. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday and Friday, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas  
and his Portuguese counterpart, Jaime Gama, will meet with Annan 
about wrapping up the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks are the first since Annan announced in March that the  
two sides would hold a ballot so East Timor can decide whether it 
wants autonomy or independence from Indonesia.

<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- A kid in a white shirt heaved something  
up onto the high school roof, and it exploded in billowing smoke. 
Sophomore Don Arnold thought it was just a lunchtime prank, a 
firecracker maybe. 
</P>
<P>
	Then students started falling.  
</P>
<P>
	``One boy was running and suddenly his ankle just puffed up in  
blood,'' said the 16-year-old Arnold. ``A girl was running and her 
head popped open'' when a bullet slammed into her skull. 
</P>
<P>
	They were the first to be shot in Tuesday's bloody attack at  
Columbine High School outside Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnold's girlfriend, Lindsay Hamilton, 15, was inside the school  
reviewing for a biology test when she heard shots and explosions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good day to die!'' she said someone yelled at one  
point. ``We want everyone to die!'' 
</P>
<P>
	She and 30 other biology students holed up in the science room  
with their teacher for four hours while unspeakable tragedy 
unfolded outside. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack ended only when two suspects who had stalked through  
hallways spraying bullets apparently killed themselves in the 
school library just down the hall. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time Hamilton was reunited with Arnold -- after a SWAT  
team escorted her class around puddles of blood -- 15 people were 
dead, including the shooters. 
</P>
<P>
	Many students were in the cafeteria when the assault on  
Columbine High began. The first lunch shift started at 11:10 a.m. 
and was in full swing when food server Karen Nielsen heard someone 
yell, ``Get down!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen said she heard shots coming from outside and rushed to a  
window. She saw three victims outside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was on automatic,'' she said. ``It was just, 'get to the  
wounded.''' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the boys felled outside the cafeteria door had been shot  
in the face, another was shot in the back. The third looked dead. 
Nielsen ran back inside and called 911. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's deputies responded swiftly, but at least two hours  
ticked by before officers surrounded the building and moved in. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had initial people there right away, but we couldn't get  
in,'' Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone said. ``We were way 
outgunned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Students described their attackers as heavily armed -- with  
semiautomatic weapons and an assault rifle, some said -- and one 
student said one of the shooters took off his ankle-length black 
coat to reveal what appeared to be hand grenades. 
</P>
<P>
	When the attackers strode into the cafeteria, ``Everyone was  
trying to crawl at first, but then someone got up and ran, and 
everybody was running,'' said freshman Chris Donnelly, 15. ``I saw 
someone bleeding on the floor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearby, Nielsen was hiding with several other employees in the  
restroom of the teachers' lounge. They cringed when the attackers 
banged on other doors, shouting, ``We know you're in there,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Terrible moments passed. The shooting receded. One person  
ventured out hesitantly -- and saw wounded students strewn across 
the cafeteria. He returned to hiding in the lounge. 
</P>
<P>
	When Nielsen escaped about 90 minutes after the first shots, the  
two wounded students she'd seen were gone; the dead body was still 
there. According to students, the attackers next targeted the 
library, shooting as they walked up the stairs and down the hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Many hours later, after law officers had swept the school,  
checking every abandoned bookbag, backpack and gym satchel for 
explosives, the sheriff assessed the carnage on the second floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The library was one of the last rooms we entered, and it was  
the most gruesome,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Surrounding the bodies of the attackers, both juniors at  
Columbine, were the bodies of 10 of their victims. 
</P>
<P>
	SWAT teams began freeing clusters of panicked students and  
teachers from their hiding places about 2:30 p.m. Live television 
feeds showed them sprinting from the school, most with hands held 
high overhead, to holding areas where they were frisked, questioned 
and offered medical care. 
</P>
<P>
	Many survivors were reunited with anxious loved ones at a nearby  
elementary school. But it took a few more hand-wringing moments. 
Parents watched their precious children from a distance, but could 
not immediately speak with them or embrace them, while authorities 
finished their questioning on the school stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Other parents suffered a night of sinking desperation, their  
eyes scanning lists of students accounted for, either unharmed or 
in hospitals -- but not finding the names they love. 
</P>
<P>
	With the risk of rigged explosives deemed too high to continue  
their investigation overnight, authorities had no choice but to 
shut down the crime scene -- with bodies scattered throughout the 
Colorado high school.

<HEADLINE> Men's Gymnastics Could Be Dogfight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Nebraska has the homecourt advantage for  
the NCAA men's gymnastics championships, but the Cornhuskers may 
not have the depth to bring home the title. 
</P>
<P>
	With three gymnasts out with injuries, the Huskers will try for  
their ninth title with just six competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The team race is wide open,'' Penn State coach Randy Jepson  
said. ``Nebraska is held back by a lack of depth. The team that 
wins will need to put together two great meets, back-to-back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska's Jason Hardabura says his team isn't about to give in,  
though. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what you expect from this meet,'' he said  
Wednesday's news conference, ``but I guarantee you're going to see 
a dog fight out there. It will be a battle with six teams giving 
100 percent. When Friday comes, and there's three teams left, it's 
going to be another war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska, the West Regional winner, will be going against  
top-ranked Michigan, Ohio State, Penn State, Brigham Young and 
Stanford in the six-team competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Team preliminaries will be Thursday and the top three will  
advance to Friday's finals. The all-around championship also will 
be decided Thursday, and Nebraska has two of the top five ranked 
all-arounders in Hardabura (No. 1) and junior Derek Leiter (No. 4). 
Individual event finals are Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is as good of an NCAA field that I've seen,'' Nebraska  
coach Francis Allen said. ``I watched Ohio State and Michigan 
practice, and I was very impressed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan is making its first NCAA championship appearance since  
1974. 
</P>
<P>
	Brigham Young enters the meet under a cloud. BYU coach Mako  
Satamoto recently was told the school is dropping the sport after 
next season. The announcement shocked coaches and gymnasts. 
</P>
<P>
	``(The administration) never really gave us an answer why,''  
BYU's Guard Young said. ``We had no idea that we were being 
considered to be dropped.''

<HEADLINE> Congress Approves Education Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress approved its first substantive  
legislation of the year Wednesday, a measure that would give states 
more freedom in how they spend federal education dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The House approved the ``Ed-Flex'' bill 368-57, and the Senate  
98-1, with many lawmakers saying the shootings at a Denver area 
high school Tuesday further justified the need to work for better 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said he would sign it ``without delay.''  
</P>
<P>
	``I am particularly pleased that the conference report  
strengthens accountability measures and preserves our effort to 
reduce class size in the early grades,'' Clinton said in a 
statement released by the White House. ``The bipartisan work on 
this legislation shows we can and must work together to improve our 
nation's schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, eager to show their commitment to education and  
other post-impeachment legislative priorities, hailed the bill's 
passage. To enhance the measure's chances, GOP leaders had to give 
up a major provision that exposed it to a presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would enable states and school districts to be released  
from some rules that ordinarily must be met to obtain federal 
funding. In exchange, they would have to set up their own programs 
under which they would be accountable for better educational 
results. 
</P>
<P>
	It would expand to all 50 states and the District of Columbia a  
demonstration program set up in 1994 that was limited to 12 states. 
</P>
<P>
	This Congress has passed a Republican budget outline for the  
coming fiscal year, but this would be the first major piece of 
legislation to go to Clinton for his signature. 
</P>
<P>
	While taking only a small step toward the Republican goal of  
returning more education money and responsibility to states and 
local school districts, GOP leaders praised the House action. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the last two years we had the most effective education  
effort in the history of the Congress of the United States,'' said 
Rep. William Goodling, R-Pa., chairman of the House Education and 
Workforce Committee. He cited this bill and legislation on 
vocational training, Head Start, charter schools and child 
nutrition, among others. 
</P>
<P>
	To avoid a presidential veto, a House-Senate conference  
abandoned a provision promoted by Senate Majority Leader Trent 
Lott, R-Miss., that Democrats said would undermine Clinton's drive 
to hire 100,000 new teachers to reduce class sizes. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott's measure would have let schools take some of the $1.2  
billion allocated for this year to hire some of the 100,000 
teachers and spend it instead on special education needs. In place 
of that, the bill says small districts with class sizes of 18 or 
fewer students may join with other districts to use the money for 
teacher training. 
</P>
<P>
	To participate in the Ed-Flex program under the bill, states  
would have to apply to the Education secretary for a waiver from 
the normal rules, explaining what educational goals would be 
achieved and how progress toward those goals would be evaluated. 
The waiver could be revoked after three years if the secretary 
concludes the state is not meeting its objectives. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe it will provide schools and their students with the  
tools to improve academic achievement,'' said Rep. Michael Castle, 
R-Del., who co-sponsored the bill with Rep. Tim Roemer, D-Ind. ``It 
allows local schools and districts to think outside the box.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some Democrats said they opposed the trend of reducing the  
federal role in improving performance in public schools, 
particularly in poorer school districts. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., the only senator to vote against  
the bill, said Congress was abandoning ``a value which says that we 
as a nation have certain core commitments and beliefs and one of 
them is that we are going to be sure that there is protection and 
some commitment to poor children in America.'' Sen. Tom Harkin, 
D-Iowa, did not vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Education Committee's ranking Democrat, Rep. William  
Clay of Missouri, said it opened ``unprecedented loopholes for 
states and school districts to avoid their obligations to serve 
poor school children first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., pointed to the school shooting  
outside Denver as indicative of the ``tremendous social problems'' 
that schools face and the need to give them the flexibility to deal 
with them. ``We in Washington shouldn't tell them how to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 800.

<HEADLINE> Ducks' Hebert Injured in 2nd Period </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Anaheim goaltender Guy Hebert was injured midway  
through the second period of Wednesday night's playoff game when 
Detroit forward Brendan Shanahan was sent flying and his skate hit 
Hebert in the mask. 
</P>
<P>
	Hebert was down about three minutes, but got up on his own and  
skated off. 
</P>
<P>
	He was replaced by Tom Askey, who was an emergency callup from  
Cincinnati of the IHL on Wednesday because backup goalie Dominic 
Roussel had the flu. 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan was driving toward the net when he was checked by Ducks  
defenseman Ruslan Salei and sent flying. His skate appeared to hit 
Hebert on the top left side of his mask. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's fine. He was a little dazed but it's nothing serious,''  
Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg said after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Hartsburg said Hebert and Roussel will be ready for Friday's  
game. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury occurred at 9:33 with the Red Wings winning 3-2.  
</P>
<P>
	Askey was 21-22-3 this season with a 2.72 goals-against average.  
He has played in seven NHL games with a 0-1-2 record and a 2.64 
goals-against average.

<HEADLINE> Most Asian Markets Slip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets fell Wednesday, with  
the Tokyo market tumbling on a pessimistic forecast about Japan's 
economic outlook, although prices rose moderately in Hong Kong and 
Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 202.09  
points, or 1.21 percent, to close at 16,495.02, a two-week low. On 
Tuesday, the Nikkei had gained 22.90 points, or 0.14 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo shares fell after the International Monetary Fund  
predicted that Japan's economy would shrink by 1.4 percent this 
year, compared with its previous prediction of an 0.5 percent 
contraction. 
</P>
<P>
	``It underlines the fact that things are not improving as much  
as people expected,'' said Robert Sasaki, head of the quantitative 
strategy group at Jardine Fleming Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the U.S. dollar rose against the yen as the  
IMF report deflated confidence in the Japanese economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 118.98 yen, up 0.94 yen from late Tuesday in  
Tokyo and above its late New York level of 118.78 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, share prices, which have risen steadily in recent  
weeks, rallied again as more overseas money rushed to the market.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Comforts Colorado Community </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton struggled from 1,500 miles  
away Wednesday to ease the horror and sorrow of Columbine High 
School. Cabinet officials mobilized what help they could offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The president weighed making a visit to the Littleton, Colo.,  
community like those he made to Oklahoma City after the 1995 
bombing and in June to Oregon's Thurston High, the last school 
shooting episode to burst into national headlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of us are struggling to understand exactly what happened  
and why. There is a deep desire to comfort the grieving and counsel 
the children,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	By moving back a Thursday work session with visiting British  
Prime Minister Tony Blair, Clinton made room in his schedule but no 
immediate decision on visiting the students, parents and teachers 
of suburban Denver. Aides were looking at next week's schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, as a gesture of respect  
for the community's grief, canceled appearances at political 
fund-raising events Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials were looking for an appropriate way for  
the president personally to comfort Littleton, press secretary Joe 
Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president wants to do what's best for the local  
community,'' Lockhart said. ``We are especially sensitive to not 
causing any disruption or distraction to the ongoing efforts 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Clinton said the relative calm in the day after the  
gunfire inside Columbine was a good time for parents everywhere to 
reassure children of their safety -- and ``to take this moment once 
again to hammer home to all the children of America that violence 
is wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also beseeched parents to ``ask what else they can do to  
shield our children from violent images and experiences that warp 
young perceptions and obscure the consequences of violence -- to 
show our children by the power of our own example how to resolve 
conflicts peacefully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president said nothing about guns or gun control.  
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said later that Clinton's support for tightly  
restricting youth access to guns is well known -- but not much 
information immediately was known about the weapons used at 
Columbine. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a dozen federal agents from the Bureau of Alcohol,  
Tobacco and Firearms focused on tracing the arsenal -- two sawed-off 
shotguns, one handgun and one carbine, the White House said -- to 
determine who licensed them, and how and where the teen-age 
suspects got hold of such firepower. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must cut off teen-agers' easy access to guns and drugs and  
work to change a popular culture that glorifies violence and 
mayhem,'' Gore said in a speech at New York's Ellis Island. ``The 
world's eyes are upon us and our children's eyes are upon us too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from the departments of Education, Treasury, Justice  
and Health and Human Services and from the Federal Emergency 
Management Administration held a morning-after conference call on 
what aid they could give Jefferson County, where Columbine High is 
located. Education Secretary Richard Riley consulted the local 
school superintendent by phone. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno was to fly to Denver and meet  
privately Thursday with law enforcement officials and 
victim-services providers, said Justice Department spokesman Myron 
Marlin. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we must do now is learn from this tragedy and use the  
lessons to help prevent future tragedies,'' Reno said at a 
Minneapolis appearance Wednesday. ``Although it comes as little 
comfort at a time like this, we must remember that schools are 
still among the safest places for America's children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department officials said federally trained crisis  
counselors already based in Denver would most likely be deployed to 
help Columbine students and their families. 
</P>
<P>
	The team was put in place by Justice to assist victim families  
who traveled to Denver to observe the trials of Timothy McVeigh and 
Terry Nichols for bombing the Oklahoma City federal building in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the position of the federal government, we would  
acknowledge that there are limits to what we can do,'' Lockhart 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``But there certainly should be no limits to what we try to do.  
... We stand ready to move in as quickly as the local community 
deems appropriate.''

<HEADLINE> Congress Reacts to School Shootings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers reacted Wednesday to the Colorado  
shootings by dusting off stalled proposals for improved school 
security and urging passage of tougher gun control laws. Some 
members of Congress are seeking a ``national dialogue'' on school 
violence and asking for more prayer in schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should not wait for another incident to happen before we  
take some action,'' said Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	He is sponsoring a bill that would set aside $10 million so  
schools could benefit from security measures developed at the 
Energy Department's Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico. 
Examples include electronic identification cards for students, 
instant drug detection equipment and mechanisms to prevent false 
fire alarms. 
</P>
<P>
	Bingaman said an Albuquerque, N.M., high school participating in  
a pilot project with the lab has seen dramatic declines in violent, 
property and other crimes since 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen people were killed Tuesday in the shootings at a high  
school in the Denver suburb of Littleton. 
</P>
<P>
	The killings prompted gun control advocates to renew calls for  
stricter gun laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``A teen-ager can only do so much damage with his fists,'' said  
Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., the National Rifle Association's chief  
advocate in Congress, said the problems that create ``young 
demons'' like the Colorado shooters ``go far deeper'' than access 
to guns. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Congress and the president only can do so much. ``The  
solution's going to have to come from our schools,'' Barr said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Czwartacki, spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent  
Lott, R-Miss., noted Congress had set aside $60 million last year 
for a program to station police officers in schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jim Jeffords, R-Vt., chairman of the Health, Education,  
Labor and Pensions Committee, plans to go ahead with school safety 
hearings that already had been scheduled for May. 
</P>
<P>
	One colleague, GOP Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri, said Congress  
must re-examine federal laws that interfere with a school's ability 
to prevent such incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Another lawmaker, Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., urged  
consideration of her proposal encouraging states to detain 
juveniles for at least 24 hours for bringing guns to school. 
</P>
<P>
	But she, too, said a solution to the deadly combination of  
schools, students and guns lies not with Congress. Parents must be 
more involved with their children, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to talk to our children after they get home from  
school every night, at the dinner table, on weekends to find out 
what they're thinking, what they're feeling,'' Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others called for a national discussion of school violence.  
</P>
<P>
	``We need to sit down together, and soon, to begin a meaningful  
conversation about the practical and concrete steps to be taken to 
prevent these tragedies,'' said Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of 
Oregon, where a 16-year-old is accused of killing his parents and 
fatally shooting two classmates at a high school in Springfield 
last May. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Rep. Tim Roemer, D-Ind.: ``Let us have and engage in a  
national dialogue to stop this hatred and violence in our 
schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From Rep. James Traficant Jr., D-Ohio, came a call for more  
prayer in school. ``People who pray together are not likely ... to 
kill one another,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, the shootings at Columbine High School led two  
Colorado state lawmakers to withdraw gun proposals from the current 
legislative calendar. 
</P>
<P>
	One measure, by Republican state Rep. Gary McPherson, would let  
state law override local ordinances on gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	McPherson said he acted ``out of deference to the victims and  
their families. Now is not the time to have this debate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado House's majority leader, GOP state Rep. Doug Dean,  
was sponsoring a bill to simplify the issuance of permits for 
concealed weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Dean reported receiving calls at his Colorado Springs home, some  
of them with ``veiled threats,'' after the Littleton shootings.

<HEADLINE> IBM Earnings Jump 42 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Riding a surge in PC sales and increased  
revenues in its services business, IBM posted first-quarter 
earnings of $1.47 billion, a 42 percent increase from the year-ago 
period that easily surpassed analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	In the three months ended March 31, International Business  
Machines Corp. earned $1.55 a share, compared to earnings of $1.04 
billion, or $1.06 a share, in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had predicted earnings of  
$1.41 a share for the Armonk, N.Y.-based company. 
</P>
<P>
	First-quarter revenue rose 15 percent to $20.3 billion from  
$17.6 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM's shares soared $18.12 1/2 to $189 in trading on secondary  
markets following the report, which was released after the close of 
Wednesday's session on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock had 
risen $2.12 1/2 to $171.87 1/2 in regular NYSE trading. 
</P>
<P>
	An 18-point jump by IBM, one of the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones  
industrial average, could translate into a gain of more than 79 
points by Dow at the start of Thursday's NYSE trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst reaction was very positive, especially given the  
troubles at rival Compaq Computer Corp., which ousted its chief 
executive on Sunday after warning a week earlier that its 
first-quarter profit was only half as large as expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question this was a big surprise,'' said George  
Elling, an analyst with Lehman Brothers. ``It's certainly excellent 
results in a quarter where Wall Street was wary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We were expecting a strong quarter, but they beat our bullish  
expectations,'' said John Jones, an analyst with Salomon Smith 
Barney. 
</P>
<P>
	Both cautioned that the increases seen in virtually all sectors  
needed to be considered in light of a poor first-quarter a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	While IBM officials credited software and service revenue for 60  
percent of their gross profit, the computer giant's report showed 
revenue strength across the board, and throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardware sales rose 17 percent to $8.6 billion, with PC sales  
rising 50 percent to $3.6 billion. Server performance was mixed, 
though IBM noted strong sales for its System/390 server. 
</P>
<P>
	Software sales for both IBM and non-IBM platforms rose 10  
percent to $2.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues from business services, through which IBM installs and  
runs corporate computers, rose 19 percent to $7.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief financial officer Douglas Maine said during a conference  
call with analysts that IBM had received nine service contracts 
worth nearly $10 billion in the quarter -- including deals with AT&AMP;T 
Corp., CompUSA, Ford Motor Co. and Mitsubishi Trust -- and now has 
contracts totaling $55 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman and chief executive Louis Gerstner said in a statement  
that the results -- which set first-quarter records for earnings per 
share, revenue and net income -- were a ``direct reflection of the 
power of the strategies we have put in place over the last few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Services is clearly the largest and fastest-growing portion of  
the information technology industry, and we continue to extend our 
leadership position in each quarter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IBM also said it will continue to explore direct sales over the  
Internet to businesses and consumers. Maine said that IBM expects 
to sell $10 billion to $15 billion in hardware, services and 
software directly over the Internet in 1999, compared to $3.3 
billion in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM experienced revenue growth throughout the world, rising 13  
percent in the Americas, 20 percents in the Europe/Middle 
East/Africa region, and a 20 percent rise in the Asia-Pacific 
region. Maine said, however, that the company still remains 
concerned about the ongoing economic struggles in the region -- 
especially in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Maine also said that IBM was not seeing any signs of a global  
slowdown in information technology sales, and that IBM had not 
experienced any fallout from the Year 2000 bug. ``We really saw no 
significant evidence in changes of customer buying pattern,'' he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the 12th straight quarter that IBM has exceeded Wall  
Street's consensus, said Chuck Hill, director of research at First 
Call.

<HEADLINE> IOC Member to Congress: Butt Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- An influential IOC member thinks the  
U.S. Congress should mind its own business about reforming the 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain wrote this week to IOC president Juan Antonio  
Samaranch and said Congress questions whether the IOC will enact 
``comprehensive and meaningful reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Gosper of the International Olympic committee rejected  
calls by Congress for monthly updates on reform. He said the IOC 
should make its own changes without outside suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we have any responsibility to report to the  
Senate committee on an ongoing basis,'' Gosper told a Foreign 
Correspondents Association luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know any international corporations doing (that). I  
don't know any U.S. corporations doing it, and don't know why we 
should be asked to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's Senate Commerce Committee investigated the Olympic  
bribery scandal in which 10 IOC members have resigned or been 
expelled amid accusations of vote-buying for Salt Lake City's 
successful 2002 bid to hold the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper, a member of the IOC ethics commission, said his group  
has no obligation to deliver monthly updates. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am surprised he (McCain) didn't give us more credit and I am  
surprised that some of his members suggested that putting in place 
the ethics commission ... is not seen as more than a public 
relations exercise,'' Gosper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC ignored the recommendations of an ethics panel headed by  
former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell. McCain thinks the 
IOC is not moving quickly enough on restructuring and contends the 
whole process of reform goes through Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper said Samaranch has the support of IOC members.  
</P>
<P>
	``When the ship gets into trouble, you don't rush up to the  
captain's cabin and throw him overboard,'' he said. ``In fact, you 
rush up to make sure he doesn't jump overboard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper said he sees no requirement for the IOC to adopt the  
reforms suggested by the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a simple oversight to say that because a high proportion  
of the corporations that sponsor and work as partners are from the 
United States, then all the money comes from the United States and 
the United States must have a key say in all events,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethics committee, composed mostly of non-IOC members, meets  
for the first time May 3. The IOC board meets the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper also said the investigation into Australian IOC member  
Phil Coles probably will be handed to the ethics commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, reprimanded after the Salt Lake investigation, is accused  
of accepting $6,300 worth of jewelry in connection with Athens' 
failed bid for the 1996 Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Compaq Meets Diminished Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Compaq Computer Corp. reported a $281 million  
first-quarter profit today that met its own recently diminished 
forecast, hurt by stiff price competition and slow sales of its 
most profitable business computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were released four days after the world's largest  
maker of personal computers forced out its chief executive to try 
to restore Compaq's credibility on Wall Street. A week earlier, the 
company had warned it would earn less than half the profit analysts 
had been expected for the quarter just ended. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite our overall corporate strength, our first-quarter  
results are disappointing and unacceptable,'' Compaq chairman Ben 
Rosen, who has temporarily replaced ousted CEO Eckhard Pfeiffer, 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will aggressively pursue the actions necessary to realize  
our enormous potential, achieve our traditional levels of 
profitable growth, and build long-term shareholder value.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq's first-quarter results sharply exceeded its year-ago  
performance, but they were below what Wall Street had been 
expecting as recently as the beginning of April. 
</P>
<P>
	In late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Compaq's  
shares were down 25 cents at $23.75, more than 50 percent below 
where the stock peaked earlier this year. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Compaq Meets Diminished Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Compaq Computer Corp. reported a $281 million  
first-quarter profit today that met its own recently diminished 
forecast, hurt by stiff price competition and slow sales of its 
most profitable business computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were released four days after the world's largest  
maker of personal computers forced out its chief executive to try 
to restore Compaq's credibility on Wall Street. A week earlier, the 
company had warned it would earn less than half the profit analysts 
had been expected for the quarter just ended. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite our overall corporate strength, our first-quarter  
results are disappointing and unacceptable,'' said Compaq chairman 
Ben Rosen, who has temporarily replaced ousted CEO Eckhard 
Pfeiffer, in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will aggressively pursue the actions necessary to realize  
our enormous potential, achieve our traditional levels of 
profitable growth, and build long-term shareholder value.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq's first-quarter results sharply exceeded its year-ago  
performance, but they were below what Wall Street had been 
expecting as recently as the beginning of April. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq warned April 9 that it would earn 15 cents a share on the  
$9.4 billion in revenue. The warning sent Compaq's shares

<HEADLINE> Fla. Pushes Orange Juice on Youth / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKELAND, Fla. (AP) -- Hoping to build a base of lifelong orange  
juice drinkers, the Florida Department of Citrus is testing a 
marketing campaign aimed at children and teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
	During the first three months of this year, the department spent  
$450,000 on television ads and a series of promotions in schools 
focusing on children between the ages of 6 and 18 in Grand Rapids, 
Mich., and Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, the Department of Citrus has sponsored a program that  
gets school cafeterias to serve orange juice. But the new campaign 
marks the first time the department is appealing directly to 
children and teen-agers to drink more orange juice. 
</P>
<P>
	``This age group is large and is very important,'' Linda  
Hawbaker, the department's school marketing director, told members 
of the Florida Citrus Commission at a meeting Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Marketing officials dusted off a 1996 television commercial  
popular with children and young adults and also held promotions at 
schools that promised a visit from an Apollo astronaut for the 
school whose students drank the most orange juice. 
</P>
<P>
	Citrus officials in the near future also hope to have an  
Internet Web site attractive to children and teens and a 
partnership with a sports event geared toward the age group. 
</P>
<P>
	With kids drinking an average of about eight gallons each year,  
children and teens already drink more orange juice than the average 
consumption of Americans, about 5.5 gallons each year. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- U.S. Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., wants the  
Senate to investigate why General Mills and Kellogg are raising 
cereal prices when farm prices are declining. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a short circuit in the economic wiring here,'' Dorgan  
said. ``Farmers suffer big losses growing the grain, while cereal 
manufacturers reap big profits turning the same grain into 
breakfast cereal. The family farmer is being cheated out of a fair 
return.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General Mills is raising cereal prices 2.5 percent, an increase  
some analysts say will cause retail prices to rise by 10 cents a 
box. Kellogg raised prices 2.7 percent in December. 
</P>
<P>
	General Mills defended its move. ``The current average retail  
price for a box of our cereal is about the same as it was in 1993, 
while average consumer prices for food at home since then have 
increased about 3 percent annually,'' said Austin Sullivan, General 
Mills spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody ever suggested that grain prices were behind our  
action,'' he added. ``Grain is just one of many cost factors 
affecting cereal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dorgan asked the Senate Agriculture Committee to investigate the  
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the chairman, Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., and  
Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa, the ranking minority member, 
Dorgan said producers are struggling to survive in the wake of a 
general price collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	The big cereal manufacturers, meanwhile, are returning profits  
of around 30 percent, even before the latest price increases, 
Dorgan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Farmers deserve an answer to the issue of widening margins,  
especially as they are likely to be blamed for the retail cereal 
price increases,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Corporate Mergers Could Speed Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A change in an obscure accounting rule is likely  
to result in a new surge in corporate mergers over the next 19 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	In a decision aimed at helping investors understand the impact  
of corporate takeovers, the Financial Accounting Standards Board 
voted Wednesday to eliminate ``pooling of interests,'' an 
accounting tool used in such recent mergers as the combination of 
Chrysler and Daimler-Benz and the union of Citicorp with Travelers 
Group. 
</P>
<P>
	The action is expected to accelerate corporate takeovers as  
companies race to find partners before the accounting change takes 
effect Jan. 1, 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would expect there will be a flurry of deals,'' said John  
Bishop, a partner at PriceWaterhouseCoopers. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine of the 10 largest acquisitions last year were classified as  
pooling of interests, according to Securities Data Co. Only AT&AMP;T's 
deal with Tele-Communications was tallied under ``purchase 
accounting'' rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite its popularity, pooling accounting has earned some vocal  
critics, among them Texaco, General Motors and International 
Business Machines. 
</P>
<P>
	When two companies merge under the pooling method, they simply  
add their balance sheets together, line by line. 
</P>
<P>
	While it sounds easy, opponents of the rule argue the method  
hurts investors for several reasons: Companies tend to be generous 
in paying for their targets and don't disclose the premiums they 
pay for the assets being acquired. What's more, the companies can't 
sell off assets or buy back stock for two years after the 
acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	``With pooling, an investor has a hard time telling what  
actually happened in the transaction, because you're not seeing 
what the company actually paid,'' said Deborah Harrington, a 
spokeswoman for the Financial Accounting Standards Board. By 
contrast, ``In a purchase (transaction), the investor has a whole 
lot more information about the deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's decision, a major step in a process that will be  
completed next year, will require all mergers to be accounted for 
as a straightforward purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	In purchase accounting, the buying company must treat the  
acquired company as an investment, and any premium paid over the 
value of the assets is carried on the buyer's balance sheet as 
``goodwill,'' and must be written off against earnings over several 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling would be a blow to companies like Yahoo! and America  
Online, which are buying companies with their high-flying stocks, 
and are loathe to do anything that will hurt their earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new rules, for example, Yahoo!'s $6.2 billion stock  
acquisition of Broadcast.com might look a lot less attractive. 
Yahoo!, an Internet search engine, is paying a hefty premium for 
Broadcast.com, a provider of TV and audio on the Web, which has yet 
to turn a profit. If Yahoo! had to write off the premium against 
its earnings, it too might be in the red. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to both Yahoo! and AOL were not immediately returned.  
</P>
<P>
	The Financial Accounting Standards Board will publish the  
proposed rule at the end of July, and while it will take public 
comment, the organization isn't expected to waver. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's decision was unanimous,'' Harrington said.

<HEADLINE> Goodyear Earnings Fall 25 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber Co. earnings fell 25  
percent amid depressed demand from Asian and Latin American 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear reported that excluding one-time restructuring charges,  
it earned $141.5 million, or 90 cents a share, down from 
first-quarter 1998 profits of $176.8 million, or $1.11 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	The results matched the estimates of analysts surveyed by First  
Call Corp. but Goodyear stock slipped 50 cents to close at $56.37 1/2 
a share on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales fell to $2.99 billion from $3.09 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear took $167.4 million in charges during the quarter to  
cut 4,200 jobs worldwide and save $150 million in expenses a year. 
When those charges are factored in, the company's earnings dropped 
to $25.5 million, or 16 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges cover the cost of previously announced staff cuts  
including a combined 1,600 jobs in Gadsden, Ala., and Freeport, 
Ill., almost 300 in Europe, 1,500 in Latin America and 800 in 
Goodyear's chemical, engineered products and Asia tire divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	First-quarter tire sales dropped in North and South America and  
Asia due to weak economies in those regions. But sales rose in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Samir G. Gibara, chairman and chief executive officer, said  
Goodyear's second-quarter profits would be hurt by the cost of 
cutting inventories and because of the weak economies in emerging 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, the benefits of our growth and rationalization  
(restructuring) initiatives, and the progressive economic recovery 
in emerging markets, should be reflected in the company's 
second-half results,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Most Asian Markets Slip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets fell Wednesday, with  
the Tokyo market tumbling on a pessimistic forecast about Japan's 
economic outlook, although prices rose moderately in Hong Kong and 
Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 202.09  
points, or 1.21 percent, to close at 16,495.02, a two-week low. On 
Tuesday, the Nikkei had gained 22.90 points, or 0.14 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo shares fell after the International Monetary Fund  
predicted that Japan's economy would shrink by 1.4 percent this 
year, compared with its previous prediction of an 0.5 percent 
contraction. 
</P>
<P>
	``It underlines the fact that things are not improving as much  
as people expected,'' said Robert Sasaki, head of the quantitative 
strategy group at Jardine Fleming Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the U.S. dollar rose against the yen as the  
IMF report deflated confidence in the Japanese economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 118.98 yen, up 0.94 yen from late Tuesday in  
Tokyo and above its late New York level of 118.78 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, share prices, which have risen steadily in recent  
weeks, rallied again as more overseas money rushed to the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 1.1 percent, or 133.98  
points, to 12,543.76. The Hang Seng had plunged 2.8 percent Tuesday 
after a powerful three-day rally. 
</P>
<P>
	In Singapore, prices extended their recent rally, with smaller  
stocks leading the gain. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark Straits Times Index closed at 1,842.33 points, up  
32.85 points, or 1.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Many smaller Asian bourses fell back as investors sold back  
their shares, after a flood of foreign funds in recent weeks pushed 
share prices to levels unseen in more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	In Seoul, South Korea, the Kospi index fell 3.5 percent, or  
27.17 points, to 743.26. The index had risen 11 percent in the past 
seven trading days on foreign buying and on lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In Taipei, Taiwan, the key Weighted Price Index fell back from  
the nearly nine-month high reached on Tuesday, losing 2 percent, or 
153.38 points, to close at 7,474.16. The decline was the largest 
since Feb. 3, when the index fell almost 4.0 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In Manila, the Philippines, the 13-day rally which pushed the  
key PSE index up 17 percent also snapped. The index plunged 1.9 
percent, or 45.68 points, to 2,312.97. 
</P>
<P>
	In Jakarta, Indonesia, the JSX Composite index fell for a second  
day, losing 1.1 percent, or 5.345 points, to 480.625 points. 
</P>
<P>
	ELSEWHERE:   	
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai shares fell as investors sold bank stocks after  
several announced poor first-quarter results. The SET index slipped 
8.18 points, or 2 percent, to 397.93. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Shares fell as traders shrugged off news that  
Moody's Investors Service raised its ratings outlook for Malaysia. 
The Composite Index fell 0.8 percent, or 4.83 points, to 616.70. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian shares fell in busy trading, triggered by  
lower commodity prices and drop in the Tokyo stock market. The All 
Ordinaries index closed at 3,068.3 points, down 21.8 points, or 0.7 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand shares rose, led by diversified  
investment concern Brierley Investments Ltd., which jumped 12 
percent on anticipation of a new business plan. The benchmark

	Colo. School Checked for Booby Traps  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Bomb squad officers checked lockers and  
backpacks today for booby traps as investigators tried to piece 
together clues to one of the deadliest school massacres in U.S. 
history. They had to work around bodies still lying where they fell 
in Columbine High School more than a day earlier. Fourteen students 
and one teacher were killed, including the two teen-age gunmen who 
laughed as they opened fire on their schoolmates. Officials were 
trying to determine if others were involved in Eric Harris' and 
Dylan Klebold's shooting spree, and they questioned other members 
of the boys' group of outcasts, the ``Trenchcoat Mafia.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Congress Reacts to School Shootings  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers reacted to the Colorado shootings by  
dusting off stalled proposals for improved school security and 
urging passage of tougher gun control laws. Some members of 
Congress are seeking a ``national dialogue'' on school violence and 
asking for more prayer in schools. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M, is 
sponsoring a bill that would set aside $10 million so schools could 
benefit from security measures developed at the Energy Department's 
Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico. Examples include 
electronic identification cards for students, instant drug 
detection equipment and mechanisms to prevent false fire alarms.

	Apache Helicopters Arrive in Albania  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- With NATO missiles striking Belgrade  
by night and day, the first batch of Apache attack helicopters 
touched down in Albania on Wednesday as the Western allies 
intensified their air campaign against Yugoslavia. Apaches are 
among the most lethal tank-killers in the NATO arsenal. NATO says 
they Apaches could be sent into Kosovo by next week. Earlier today, 
NATO missiles slammed into a high-rise building which includes 
offices of President Slobodan Milosevic's ruling Socialist Party 
and eight broadcast stations. 

</P>

	U.S. Will Accept Kosovo Refugees  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States will temporarily admit as  
many as 20,000 refugees from Kosovo, the Clinton administration 
said today, even as Defense Secretary William Cohen suggested plans 
to widen the NATO campaign with a ground offensive could be put 
into place if necessary. ``It could happen very quickly,'' Cohen 
said. However, Cohen reiterated that neither President Clinton nor 
NATO allies are yet considering such a move. The decision to 
temporarily resettle refugees in the United States, announced by 
Vice President Gore in a speech at Ellis Island, replaces an 
earlier plan to possibly send them to the U.S. military base at 
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

dangerous conditions and falsified records at a psychiatric 
hospital. Charter Behavioral Health Systems, which runs 91 
hospitals in 32 states, accused CBS of violating patient 
confidentiality by sending a worker into a Charter facility in 
Charlotte with a tiny camera on his eyeglasses. The health group's

<HEADLINE> Columbia/HCA Reports Earnings Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., still  
trying to remake itself in response to a federal billing fraud 
investigation, on Wednesday posted a stronger-than-expected 12 
percent rise in first-quarter profit. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding one-time events, the nation's largest hospital chain  
earned $271 million, or 42 cents per share, up from $241 million, 
or 37 cents a share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Results exceeded Wall Street forecasts by 11 cents, according to  
First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Unusual events in the quarter included a $249 million pretax  
gain on sales of hospitals, and other reorganization and 
investigation-related costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia's stock rose $2.87 1/2, or by almost 12 percent, to close  
at $27.25 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nashvillle-based company said admissions to hospitals owned  
for at least a year, a key financial indicator, jumped 3.5 percent 
in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's real strength,'' said Nancy Weaver, an analyst with  
Stephens Inc. in Little Rock, Ark. She said admissions growth is 
the highest since the company became subject of a federal billing 
fraud investigation in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials attributed the admissions increase partly to  
several widespread flu epidemics in the United States this winter. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sheryl Skolnick, an analyst with BancBoston/Robertson  
Stephens, questioned whether the revenue numbers were real. ``I'm 
concerned that maybe they're being a little overenthusiastic about 
what collections are,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said Columbia has done well at controlling personnel  
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is doing ``better than it was, but it ain't out of  
the woods yet,'' Skolnick said. 
</P>
<P>
	Victor Campbell, Columbia/HCA senior vice president, said the  
first quarter marks the first time since the investigation began 
that the company has turned its focus back to operations, rather 
than restructuring. ``We are not sitting here today saying 
everything is like we would like it. It definitely is not. We still 
have a long way to go, but we've made tremendous progress,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia has been negotiating a settlement for several months  
with federal authorities. The company refused to estimate when such 
a deal would be made. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government and 11 states have been looking into  
whether Columbia committed fraud by overcharging Medicare and 
Medicaid. Four Columbia middle managers were indicted in Florida 
and face trial next month. 
</P>
<P>
	After the investigation began in 1997, Columbia ousted its top  
executives, stopped an aggressive hospital acquisition program and 
began a major downsizing. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia sold seven hospitals during the first quarter, leaving  
it with 297 hospitals nationwide. The company plans to sell another 
15 over the next few months. Prior to the investigation, Columbia 
owned 345 hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 7, Columbia plans to spin off 56 hospitals into two  
companies owned by Columbia stockholders. In the spinoff, Columbia 
shareholders will get one share of LifePoint Hospitals Inc. stock 
and one share of Triad Hospitals Inc. for every 19 shares of 
Columbia stock held April 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Lifepoint will have 23 hospitals in Alabama, Florida, Georgia,  
Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Tennessee, Utah and Wyoming. Triad 
will include 33 hospitals and 19 surgery centers in Alabama, 
Arizona, Arkansas, California, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, New 
Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	After the spinoffs Columbia will remain the country's largest  
for-profit hospital company with $14.3 billion in revenue.

<HEADLINE> Bristol-Myers Squibb Tops Estimate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP)-- Bristol-Myers Squibb today posted a  
stronger-than-expected 15 percent rise in first quarter profits, 
citing robust sales for its cancer and diabetes drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol, the world's fourth largest drugmaker, earned $1.1  
billion or 53 cents per share in the first quarter, up from $927 
million or 46 cents a share in the same period a year ago. Results 
beat analysts' estimates by 1 cent a share, according to First Call 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose 9 percent to $4.9 billion from $4.4 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street welcomed the report by bidding the company's stock  
up 8.4 percent. It closed up $5 at $64.25 a share on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Global pharmaceutical sales rose 15 percent to $3.4 billion in  
the quarter, including 21 percent sales growth in the United 
States. International sales rose just 5 percent as a result of the 
economic downturn in Brazil and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Pravachol, Bristol's top-selling drug, had a 9 percent increase  
in sales to $486 million. Pravachol is the world's third 
largest-selling cholesterol-lowering medication, and has about 16 
percent of the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Taxol, a breast and lung cancer drug, posted a 31 percent jump  
in sales to $329 million. Glucophage, the leading oral drug for 
non-insulin dependent diabetes, had a 55 percent increase in sales 
to $282 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol's beauty care sales rose by 7 percent to $572 million,  
benefiting from the introduction of Herbal Essences shampoo 
overseas last year. Sales of Herbal Essences, the second-biggest 
selling shampoo in the U.S. market, rose 28 percent to $164 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol's nutritional sales growth remained flat at about $449  
million. Nutritional sales include Enfamil infant formula and the 
nutritional supplement drink Boost. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it plans to seek U.S. approval later this year  
for its new hypertension drug. Bristol has two drugs, an antibiotic 
and a colorectal cancer medication, awaiting U.S. approval.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Gunman May Have Had Web Page </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Columbine High School gunman Eric Harris appears  
to have had a Web site filled with apocalyptic imagery, bomb 
diagrams and song lyrics such as ``WHAT I DON'T LIKE I WASTE.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Using the America Online screen name ``rebdomine,'' Harris  
apparently titled his Web page ``REB's words of wisdom, if you 
don't like it, ill kill you'' and packed it with drawings of 
devils, guns and pyres of skulls. 
</P>
<P>
	The AOL Web site featured lyrics such as this: ``WHAT I DON'T  
SAY I DON'T DO. WHAT I DON'T DO I DON'T LIKE. WHAT I DON'T LIKE I 
WASTE.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those lyrics and others quoted on the Web page are from various  
songs by the German industrial rock band KMFDM, which released am 
album, ``Adios,'' on Tuesday. Several songs were previewed Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	On its Web site, the band expressed sympathy for the victims of  
the shooting and said the band is against war, oppression, fascism 
and violence. It also said no members of the band condone any Nazi 
beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are sick and appalled, as is the rest of the nation, by  
what took place in Colorado yesterday,'' said Sascha K., founder of 
KMFDM. 
</P>
<P>
	At the bottom of the AOL page, Harris listed his favorite chat  
room: ``ich bin ein auslander,'' pidgen German for ``I am an 
outsider.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AOL spokeswoman Kim McCreery said she couldn't comment on  
whether this was, in fact, Harris' account but said any content 
considered relevant to the school shooting had been taken down and 
preserved for the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris also apparently had a member profile on AOL, a  
self-written description of an account holder's interests. Profiles 
thought to belong to the other gunman, Dylan Klebold, also were 
apparently taken down. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point we have no clear evidence that the people who  
were directly involved posted any kind of warnings,'' McCreery said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Gomez, an FBI spokesman in Denver, said the bureau was  
preparing search warrants to present for any information on Web 
sites and member profiles on AOL relating to the shooting. Gomez 
said the warrants would probably be served on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris' alleged page was copied and posted at another Web site  
before it was taken down. 
</P>
<P>
	While there is no way to absolutely prove these are Web pages  
created by Harris, there are indications they are real. 
</P>
<P>
	The page included a Microsoft Word document with instructions on  
making pipe bombs. Microsoft Word automatically inserts the 
author's name in the code of the document, which often can be read 
when the document is converted to plain text. 
</P>
<P>
	The name listed was Wayne N. Harris, who Eric Harris' father.  
</P>
<P>
	The copied page could also traced back to a site called ``The  
Floating Pancreas,'' another site filled with death imagery. The 
Floating Pancreas listed a profile of a member using the name 
``NiggerRip'' and an e-mail address of rebdomine@aol.com and 
included a Web page pointing back to rebdomine's original AOL 
address. 
</P>
<P>
	The profile was created in February 1998.  
</P>
<P>
	Another AOL spokeswoman, Tricia Primrose, noted that hoaxes are  
common after big news events. It is relatively easy to perpetrate 
an Internet hoax because of free e-mail services and trial accounts 
on providers like AOL.

<HEADLINE> Fake Shooting 'Warnings' Hit AOL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Within hours after news broke of the Colorado  
school shootings, people turning to cyberspace for information 
spotted what seemed like ominous warnings: 
</P>
<P>
	``Preparin' for the big april 20!! You'll all be sorry that  
day!'' said one note posted on America Online by someone purporting 
to be a member of the ``Trench Coat Mafia'' in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	But that message and others like it in AOL ``member profiles''  
apparently were fake, proliferating after the news that students 
apparently belonging to the so-called ``Trenchcoat Mafia'' had 
rampaged through a Colorado high school on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no knowledge at this point that the people involved in  
the shootings actually posted any advance warning on AOL,'' AOL 
spokeswoman Tricia Primrose said. ``It's something we'll continue 
to monitor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Primrose also said such hoaxes are not uncommon after a big news  
event. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly suspicious was a message posted to a Usenet newsgroup,  
a kind of Internet bulletin board, claiming that ``gay bikers'' had 
taken revenge against heterosexuals in Colorado and should be 
applauded. 
</P>
<P>
	Anyone with Internet access can perpetrate such hoaxes with  
ease, and often with anonymity, as free e-mail services and trial 
accounts on services like AOL have become common. 
</P>
<P>
	Helping spread them are Internet gossipmongers like Matt Drudge,  
who updated his Web site less than three hours after the shooting 
with the blaring headline: ``EXCLUSIVE: 'TRENCHCOAT MAFIA' PLACED 
WARNING OF COMING SCHOOL MASSACRE ON AOL!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked Tuesday night what he did to confirm that the member  
profile had in fact been posted before the shootings, Drudge said 
at first: ``Nothing. I just pulled it off AOL with my own eyes. ... 
I think it's completely valid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later Drudge said he had called AOL's customer-support phone  
number but the person he was referred to wouldn't give him the 
identity of the AOL member who posted the purported warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology commentator David Schenk said the Internet doesn't  
inherently encourage people to pull such pranks, but it does act as 
a powerful microphone. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are probably 10- and 12-year-olds who understand that  
the more sick they are, the more outrageous they are, the more 
likely their voice will be heard,'' Schenk said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all the new AOL profiles claimed sympathy with the shooters,  
though. One posted by someone calling him or herself 
``ArcticVirus'' said: ``Death to the Trench Coat Mafia.''

<HEADLINE> Drugs Are Controlling Hypertension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The widespread use of blood pressure drugs over the past  
half-century appears to have sharply reduced dangerous hypertension 
and potentially deadly enlargement of the heart's main pumping 
chamber, a study found. 
</P>
<P>
	Since hypertension drugs became available in the 1950s, high  
blood pressure and enlargement of the left ventricle have been cut 
in half among men in the ongoing Framingham Heart Study, the 
longest medical research project ever in this country. Among women, 
both conditions were reduced about 70 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The degree of the effect is really spectacular,'' said Dr.  
Michael C. Ruddy, chief of the hypertension section at Robert Wood 
Johnson Medical School in New Brunswick, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-decade study of 10,333 patients doesn't prove outright  
that medication caused those declines. But other research has shown 
a similar pattern of hypertension drugs lowering blood pressure and 
preventing, and even reversing, enlargement of the left ventricle, 
which pumps oxygen-rich blood into the body. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've done an astronomically good job controlling the very  
high extremes of blood pressure,'' all but eradicating them in this 
country, said Dr. Daniel Levy, director of the Framingham study. He 
said medicine also appears to be preventing left ventricle 
enlargement and reducing its severity in those who have it. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he said there's been limited progress cutting blood  
pressure among the much larger group of people with mild to 
moderate hypertension. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings were published in Thursday's issue of the New  
England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Claude Lenfant, director of the National Heart, Lung and  
Blood Institute, said the study ``clearly illustrates the positive 
impact of effective hypertension control,'' but also warned against 
complacency. The national downward trend in blood pressure slowed 
in the 1990s and rates began edging higher, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Roughly 50 million Americans have elevated blood pressure, which  
is considered to be any reading above 140 during a heartbeat and 90 
between beats. Only one-fourth of those people are controlling 
their condition adequately with drugs or diet and lifestyle 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
	Untreated hypertension can damage the kidneys and trigger  
stroke, heart attack and gradual heart failure. Heart disease and 
stroke are the nation's No. 1 and No. 3 causes of death, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Enlargement of the left ventricle worsens other heart problems  
and makes sudden death from cardiac causes six times more likely. 
</P>
<P>
	The heart institute, part of the National Institutes of Health,  
funds the Framingham study, which has tested volunteers living in 
the Boston suburb every two years since 1948. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest study involved participants ages 45 to 74 and covers  
data collected from 1950 through 1989, when there was a tenfold 
increase in the use of hypertension drugs among the men and a 
fivefold increase among the women. 
</P>
<P>
	The prevalence of blood pressure of at least 160/100 declined  
during that period from 18.5 percent to 9.2 percent among men and 
from 28 percent to 7.7 percent among women. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over that time, mortality from stroke declined by 60 percent  
in this country which overwhelmingly is related to blood pressure 
control,'' Levy noted. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it is unclear why the women showed much greater  
improvement. However, Levy and Ruddy said a probable factor is that 
the men's average weight rose nearly 10 pounds over the four 
decades, while the women's average dipped slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	Levy said it is unclear how the results apply to minorities,  
especially blacks, who have more, and worse, hypertension. The 
Framingham subjects, like their community, are overwhelmingly 
white. A group of mostly minorities added in the 1990s should 
resolve that question. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruddy predicted future research will show even greater strides  
in cutting blood pressure because many new hypertension drugs work 
better than the early ones.

<HEADLINE> Court Takes Up Disabled Care Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supreme Court justices voiced concern today  
that some mentally disabled people might be ``abandoned on the 
streets'' if a federal anti-bias law is deemed to give them a broad 
right to live in homelike settings rather than state hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	As the court heard arguments in a Georgia case expected to yield  
the decade's most important ruling on treatment for mentally 
disabled people, Justices Stephen G. Breyer and John Paul Stevens 
worried aloud about harming people the law seeks to protect. 
</P>
<P>
	The court must decide by late June whether the Americans with  
Disabilities Act requires community placement of the mentally 
disabled whenever appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	``What bothers me,'' said Breyer, ``is writing something which,  
as it works out in the real world, leaves many who need to be in 
institutions out, abandoned on the streets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But questions and comments from the bench during the hourlong  
argument session gave no clear indication as to what decision the 
court will reach. 
</P>
<P>
	``It cannot be assumed that because one option is appropriate  
another is not,'' Georgia Assistant Attorney General Patricia 
Downing said in contending that states are free to choose between 
community settings and large hospitals if each type of 
accommodation is deemed appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	But Michael Gottesman, a Georgetown University law professor  
representing two mentally disabled women who challenged Georgia's 
treatment of them, argued that their ``isolation and segregation 
from the societal mainstream of American life'' violated the 
federal law's ban on discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	``The state's obligation, if it is to provide these services, is  
to provide integrated settings,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court ruled that Georgia officials may have  
violated the law and discriminated against the two women ``by 
confining them in a segregated institution rather than in an 
integrated, community-based program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``least restrictive'' appropriate placement is required, the  
appeals court said, unless living up to the ADA would fundamentally 
change a state's services for the mentally disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	Downing called the appeals court's ruling an ``expansive, new  
interpretation of the ADA'' that varies from the law's own wording. 
On the bench, only Justice Antonin Scalia appeared to be clearly 
sympathetic to her view. 
</P>
<P>
	Gottesman and Justice Department lawyer Irving Gornstein joined  
in reading the federal law more expansively, but they, too, were 
peppered with questions from the justices. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that Georgia and other states might have a limited number  
of community settings available, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg asked 
Gottesman, ``People who come to court go to the head of the line?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Faenza of the National Mental Health Association said  
earlier that the court's ruling will determine whether the 68,000 
Americans currently in state mental institutions will continue 
being segregated from society. ``The ADA is fundamentally civil 
rights legislation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides disagree whether wide-scale use of community-based  
treatment would cost states more or less than they now spend in 
treating the mentally disabled. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue in the court fight is part of the 1990 law dealing with  
services offered by state and local governments and a 1991 
regulation requiring such services ``in the most integrated setting 
appropriate to the needs'' of disabled persons. 
</P>
<P>
	Elaine Wilson and Lois Curtis sued Georgia to get out of the  
Georgia Regional Hospital in Atlanta, one of seven mental hospitals 
the state runs. Ms. Wilson is mildly retarded and was found to have 
a borderline personality disorder. Ms. Curtis also is mildly 
retarded and was diagnosed as having schizophrenia. 
</P>
<P>
	Both women had been approved for community-based living but were  
confronted by long waiting lists. Both are now in group homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like I was in a box that I would never get out of,''  
Ms. Wilson said in a recent interview. ``I feel like a real person 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Olmstead vs. L.C., 98-536.

<HEADLINE> Woman Hit by Wild Pitch Gets $2.5M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- A woman struck in the face by a  
wild warmup pitch during a Florida Marlins game was awarded $2.5 
million by a jury for injuries that left her with lingering 
headaches and concentration problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Postlethwaite was injured by an errant pitch by former  
Philadelphia reliever Mitch Williams, who was warming up in the 
bullpen during a Phillies-Marlins game Aug. 8, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Postlethwaite, 48, actually will receive $972,000 from Tuesday's  
verdict. Additional money will come from confidential settlements 
reached with the Marlins, former Marlins owner Wayne Huizenga and 
stadium designer HOK Sports. 
</P>
<P>
	The Robbie company will owe Postlethwaite $850,500 and the  
Phillies $121,500, for a total of $972,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, nicknamed ``Wild Thing'' because of his scattershot  
arm, was warming up in the eighth inning when he uncorked a pitch 
that sailed into the stands. It struck Postlethwaite between the 
eyes and sent her to the hospital with a broken nose. 
</P>
<P>
	The former PaineWebber stockbroker hasn't worked since the  
accident and still has headaches and problems with concentration, 
according to her lawyer.

<HEADLINE> Hard Realities of a New Music World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Years of sweat, years of dreams for Tim Arlon  
and his friends were captured on a three-inch silver disc. 
</P>
<P>
	The British native moved to the United States three years ago  
with the hope of becoming a rock 'n' roll star. He put together a 
band, Edenstreet, and they wrote some songs and methodically built 
an audience by playing the bars in and around Louisville, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
	Edenstreet was heard by the right people and signed a recording  
contract with a major label. Arlon will never forget the date: May 
30, 1997. Edenstreet continued performing, polishing its act, and 
recorded a debut album. Late last year the CD was manufactured and 
sent in advance to the press and other taste-makers. 
</P>
<P>
	Then three days before Edenstreet's first single was to be  
released this winter, their company, A&AMP;M Records, ceased to exist. 
</P>
<P>
	It was swallowed up by the corporate merger that created the  
Universal Music Group. Most of A&AMP;M's staff was fired, and a few 
were lucky enough to latch on to the new parent. The deal left 
Edenstreet and probably hundreds of other musical acts in a career 
limbo. 
</P>
<P>
	Edenstreet had played the rock 'n' roll game by the rules, only  
to find the rules had changed. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are five guys sitting in Louisville whose dreams have  
just been taken away on a whim,'' Arlon said. ``And it was so close 
-- just three days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their story is all too typical. The Cowboy Junkies, 10,000  
Maniacs and Robbie Fulks have similar stories to tell. All three 
were with Geffen Records, which was absorbed in the same merger as 
A&AMP;M. 10,000 Maniacs subsequently released an album on a small, 
independent label. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Edenstreet's bad luck to get into the music business at a  
time of fundamental change. The five big companies that control the 
industry and account for nearly 90 percent of its yearly sales -- 
Sony, Warner, EMI, BMG and Universal -- are becoming leaner and 
meaner in response to Wall Street's hunger for profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Artist rosters are being pared and acts that need a few years of  
nurturing are often dropped in favor of those who can hit it big 
quick, like a teen idol pop singer or Celine Dion. 
</P>
<P>
	Rock artists are particularly vulnerable because the genre, once  
the industry's unquestioned leader, has been steadily slipping in 
influence through the 1990s as a new generation grows up more 
interested in rap and rhythm 'n' blues. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucinda Williams, whose blend of rock, country, folk and blues  
made ``Car Wheels on a Gravel Road'' one of last year's most 
critically praised albums, summed up the bleak situation last month 
in her keynote speech at the South by Southwest music conference in 
Austin, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think major labels are working anymore,'' she said.  
``It was a good idea, but it kind of crumbled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edenstreet was attracted to A&AMP;M because of its reputation as a  
congenial place that had helped artists like The Police and Sheryl 
Crow grow. The label was partly founded by a musician, Herb Alpert, 
in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	Arlon and his mates loved it. They worked closely with A&AMP;M  
executives when making the record and were honored when A&AMP;M's 
chairman, Al Cafaro, flew to Louisville to see them perform. He 
told them he believed Edenstreet would be A&AMP;M's next big rock act. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know everyone uses the term `family' about A&AMP;M, but it  
really did feel unbelievable,'' Arlon said. ``It was a great time 
for everyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The album was supposed to be released last October but A&AMP;M  
postponed it until February. The fall is when a flood of music is 
released in anticipation of the holiday shopping season, and the 
company didn't want Edenstreet to be lost in the crush. The band 
shrugged off the delay. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the bad news came, reaching Arlon while he was visiting his  
family in England during the Christmas holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Through their manager, Edenstreet tried to contact executives at  
Interscope, which had taken over A&AMP;M's remaining assets. It took 
many phone calls before Edenstreet received something of a 
nonanswer: Interscope was reviewing its options and would get back 
to them in six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Not wanting that uncertainty and questioning whether Interscope  
was right for them, Edenstreet asked for and received a release. 
Armed with the completed CD, the band is now a free agent. In other 
words, unemployed. The group is free to get the CD out in some 
other fashion, either by signing a new deal with another record 
company or releasing it on its own. The latter is very expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	An Interscope spokeswoman didn't respond to requests for  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Arlon is amazed that a company would just toss aside an  
investment; he believed A&AMP;M spent as much as a million dollars on 
Edenstreet. Yet it's not unusual. It happens often enough that 
Billboard editor-in-chief Timothy White just began writing a column 
solely about albums that were recorded and then never released to 
the public, in the hope that someone will notice the struggling 
musicians who made them. Edenstreet and other musicians being cut 
adrift will ultimately decide the new rules of operation for the 
music industry and how they get their music heard. Some careers 
will undoubtedly be ruined, dreams of stardom deferred. 
</P>
<P>
	Many artists will land on smaller, independent music labels, a  
sector that is expected to grow in response to the higher-level 
convulsions. Generally, signing with an indie label means there is 
less of a chance the music will reach a wide audience; indies cater 
well to smaller niches. 
</P>
<P>
	Distribution of music through the Internet is also an option.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we'll see fewer outlets for artists,'' said  
Hillary Rosen, CEO of the Recording Industry Association of 
America. ``I think there will be, if anything, more outlets because 
there will be more opportunities. This (consolidation) is happening 
at the same time as the Internet is beginning to explode.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edenstreet isn't sure where it will land. It hurts too much to  
walk around Louisville now and run into fans who want to know when 
their album will be ready. Band members used to be able to promise, 
``It's coming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now they don't know what to say.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shock,'' Arlon said. ``I find it quite unbelievable.  
There are so many horror stories in rock 'n' roll and the 
entertainment business. It is ruthless, absolutely ruthless.''

<HEADLINE> Marrow May Help Organ Transplants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- People receiving organ transplants are much  
less likely to reject them if they also receive some bone marrow 
from the organ donor, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	The presence of immune system cells from the donor seems to  
condition to recipient's system not to attack the new organ, Dr. 
Abdul Rao of the University of Pittsburgh reports in a paper being 
delivered today at a biology conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The effect was most dramatic in recipients of new hearts and  
lungs, Rao said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	In lung transplants, where long-term chronic rejection is a  
problem, Rao said just 4.7 percent of patients who also received 
bone marrow showed signs of rejection, compared to 31 percent of 
those without marrow. 
</P>
<P>
	Incidents of acute rejection of new hearts occurred in 38  
percent of cases when marrow was also transplanted, compared to 82 
percent of cases without marrow. 
</P>
<P>
	Even acute rejection episodes don't necessarily mean the new  
organ has to be removed, Rao said. But they do damage the organ and 
require strong doses of drugs to suppress the recipients immune 
system. Those drugs can also leave the patient vulnerable to other 
infections. 
</P>
<P>
	Rao and his colleagues at the Thomas E. Starzl Transplantation  
Institute studied 269 patients who received bone marrow along with 
transplants of various organs, including livers, pancreases, 
kidneys, intestines, hearts and lungs. The results were compared to 
131 patients who received transplants without bone marrow. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the idea for using marrow stemmed from studies of people  
who had long-term success after receiving liver transplants, 
allowing doctors to reduce their immune suppressing drugs to very 
low levels. Those people tended to have at least some donor immune 
cells in their bodies, which arrived along with the liver, even 
years after the transplant, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The coexistence of donor and recipient immune cells, called  
chimerism, is thought to be essential to long-term transplant 
success, Rao said. 
</P>
<P>
	By reducing the likelihood of the body trying to reject the new  
organ those cells allow doctors to reduce the amount of 
immune-suppressing drugs given to transplant patients to low, 
maintenance levels, said Rao. That reduces the chance of the 
patient becoming victim to some infection that his immune system 
can't fight off. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the patients in the study has been taken completely off  
the drugs, Rao said, though that may be a possibility in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	How does the marrow work?  
</P>
<P>
	During fetal development the human body's thymus gland, which  
controls the immune system, desensitizes reactive systems to its 
own body cells, so the human immune system doesn't attack itself. 
When donor marrow cells are introduced, Rao said, they appear to 
find their way to the thymus and deactivate reactive systems that 
would attack them -- and their related organs.

	ROSEBURG, Ore. (AP) -- A teen-age drifter was convicted Wednesday

ace who survived three wars but died defending his wife at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Jesse Fanus showed no emotion when he heard the verdict that  
could bring him the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Fanus was accused of kicking in the door of Carl's riverfront  
home in June, waving a sawed-off shotgun and demanding cash and the 
keys to the car. 
</P>
<P>
	When the 82-year-old retired general came out of a bedroom, the  
19-year-old Fanus fired, killing a man who won 18 air victories and 
who received the Navy Cross for his valor in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors are to return on Friday to begin considering evidence in  
the penalty phase of the trial. It could recommend Fanus die by 
injection or spend the rest of his life behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to aggravated murder, Fanus was convicted of 12  
other counts including attempted aggravated murder, robbery and 
assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Carl's widow, Edna, herself grazed in the head during the  
attack, sat behind Fanus during closing arguments and noticed how 
his coiffed hair and tie made him look much different than she 
remembered. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looks like a little altar boy, doesn't he,'' she said  
later. ``I hope he gets his just dues. 
</P>
<P>
	Fanus never denied the fatal shot, but clamed he contended he  
only intended to rob, not kill.

<HEADLINE> Utah Polygamist Pleads No Contest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOGAN, Utah (AP) -- A man accused of beating his daughter after  
she ran away from an arranged marriage to his brother pleaded no 
contest Wednesday in a trial that had many calling for a crackdown 
on Utah polygamy. 
</P>
<P>
	The plea came during jury selection in the trial of John Daniel  
Kingston, father of the 17-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like it would be in her best interest not to put her  
through more than what she has already gone through,'' Kingston, 
44, told the judge as his daughter watched in tears. 
</P>
<P>
	The case had generated enormous interest in a state with an  
estimated 25,000 polygamists. 
</P>
<P>
	Although plural marriage was abandoned by the predominant Mormon  
church in 1890, numerous sects with Mormon roots continue the 
practice in defiance of a state bigamy law that prosecutors say is 
nearly impossible to enforce. 
</P>
<P>
	The daughter, now living in foster care, says her father drove  
her to a family farm near the Idaho line in May and whipped her for 
disobeying David Ortell Kingston, 32, who had made her his 15th 
wife. He is facing incest charges at a June trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plea agreement for John Kingston, prosecutor Jon  
Bunderson agreed to reduce the charge from second-degree to 
third-degree child abuse, which carries a penalty of up to five 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Sentencing is scheduled for June 29.  
</P>
<P>
	Though lawyers for both sides say the trial was not about  
polygamy, the Kingston clan is one of the most prominent polygamous 
groups in Utah, and the issues have become inseparable. 
</P>
<P>
	No large-scale bigamy cases have been prosecuted since the  
1950s, when agents raided the town of Short Creek on the 
Utah-Arizona line. The incident backfired when the public, enraged 
by images of families being torn apart, protested and the state 
backed off. 
</P>
<P>
	But anti-polygamy groups say prosecutors should attack once  
more. 
</P>
<P>
	The clan led by patriarch Merlin Kingston goes by the name of  
the ``Latter-day Church of Christ'' and has about 1,000 members. 
The brothers are the sons of the clan's leader, who died in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Though not the largest polygamous group, the Kingstons are the  
most affluent, with assets estimated around $150 million. 
</P>
<P>
	When the issue exploded with charges filed against the Kingston  
last year, Gov. Mike Leavitt -- the great-grandson of polygamists -- 
said he thought the practice might be protected by the First 
Amendment. He soon backed away from that idea. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say it is difficult to prosecute bigamy, the only  
charge associated with plural marriage.

<HEADLINE>  Celtics' Battie Pleads Innocent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Tony Battie of the Boston Celtics pleaded innocent  
Wednesday to charges he dragged a police officer behind his car 
after being told to move the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Battie, 23, who is free on a personal recognizance bond, was  
arrested around 2:20 a.m. Saturday in front of the Cosmopolitan 
Club near the FleetCenter, according to Boston police spokeswoman 
Sgt. Detective Margot Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Battie was asked several times by an officer to move  
his car, but refused. 
</P>
<P>
	Battie also allegedly refused the officer's request for proper  
identification and tried to drive off when the officer attempted to 
arrest him, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The officer's arm was caught in the driver's window, Hill said,  
and Battie only stopped the car after the officer drew his pistol. 
</P>
<P>
	Battie faces charges that include assault and battery on a  
police officer and disorderly conduct, said Jim Borghesani, 
spokesman for the Suffolk County district attorney's office. 
Battie's next court date is May 12. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel he's done nothing wrong and the matter will be  
resolved through the appropriate judicial process,'' said Robert 
Keefe, Battie's lawyer, following the player's arraignment in 
Boston Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The Celtics said Battie was expected to play Wednesday night  
against Philadelphia.

<HEADLINE> Juice Co. Hit with E. Coli Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- For nearly a year, Odwalla Inc. executives  
thought the specter of a 1996 E. coli outbreak was behind them. 
</P>
<P>
	Most lawsuits were settled, a federal grand jury investigation  
was resolved and the company's operations began turning a profit 
once again in mid-1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the nation's largest fresh juice producer is being sued by  
the family of a boy and his father who contracted severe bacterial 
infections after allegedly drinking unpasteurized Odwalla apple 
juice in August 1996 -- more than two months before the outbreak. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers filed the case Wednesday in King County Superior Court  
on behalf of Richard Lane and Tracey Yonick, parents of Nicholas 
Lane, now 7, and said at least eight others also were sickened. 
</P>
<P>
	At company headquarters in Half Moon Bay, Calif., spokeswoman  
Barr Hogen said anyone who becomes ill from Odwalla products is 
offered full reimbursement for medical expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``To our knowledge, this is the first time we have heard about  
the Lanes or Yonick,'' Hogen said. ``Almost three years later ... 
it's very surprising to us that we would hear from reporters 
first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also said the company was never contacted by health  
officials about the possibility of earlier cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce T. Clark, a lawyer for the Lanes, said he did not approach  
the company first because, in previous claims, ``Odwalla's 
attorneys had a certain attitude ... frankly, our experience was 
that we might as well proceed to a lawsuit because we weren't going 
to get very far without one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear why the Lanes waited so long to file the suit,  
though they hired Clark about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages, gave the following  
account: 
</P>
<P>
	The boy, 5 at the time, drank Odwalla apple juice from a  
Starbucks coffee outlet in the Magnolia neighborhood of Seattle on 
Aug. 3 and 10, 1996, and was hospitalized twice for kidney-damaging 
hemolytic uremic syndrome from an infection of E. coli O157:H7. 
</P>
<P>
	Lane, then 41, became infected while caring for the boy, losing  
weight while beset by diarrhea, nausea and abdominal pain. 
</P>
<P>
	In November 1996, Seattle-King County Health Department  
investigators found the Lanes and eight other individuals had been 
infected with E. coli showing the same genetic pattern, indicating 
a common source. 
</P>
<P>
	Six of them remembered drinking unpasturized Odwalla apple juice  
in August. Four of the six also recalled drinking other apple 
juice, but in all likelihood the other juice was pasteurized, Clark 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Health Department concluded that the genetic pattern of that  
strain was different from the one involved in October and November, 
when at least 66 people fell ill and a 16-month-old Colorado girl 
died, but it couldn't determine if Odwalla was the source of the E. 
coli cases in August, according a letter Clark had. 
</P>
<P>
	This past January, however, a professor of epidemiology  
consulted by Clark wrote in a letter that ``the odds are 
overwhelming that'' the Lanes' illness was linked to Odwalla. 
</P>
<P>
	Odwalla is the nation's largest fresh juice producer with sales  
in 19 states coast to coast. Since late 1996 the company has 
flash-pasteurized all juices and smoothies except for 
fresh-squeezed citrus products. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the outbreak that year, many Odwalla juice products  
were recalled. Last May, Odwalla agreed to pay a reported $12 
million to $15 million to settle lawsuits by the families of five 
of the most severely ill children -- apparently the largest 
settlement of a lawsuit involving poisoning from fresh food. 
</P>
<P>
	A grand jury probe was resolved when Odwalla agreed to pay $1.25  
million to the federal government and $250,000 to three nonprofit 
organizations involved with food safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Four lawsuits remain unresolved, Odwalla said.

<HEADLINE> Starr Promotes Three Staff Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a sign that his Washington office won't  
shut down soon, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr promoted three 
members of his staff on Wednesday, including the key prosecutor in 
a controversial 11-hour confrontation with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr named three new deputies, elevating prosecutors Jay  
Apperson, Edward J. Page and Michael Emmick. 
</P>
<P>
	All three of the previous deputies in Starr's Washington  
operation left as the Lewinsky investigation wound down. 
</P>
<P>
	Emmick was the lead prosecutor assigned to try to persuade the  
former intern to cooperate with Starr's office in her initial 
encounter with investigators on Jan. 16, 1998, in a hotel outside 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Emmick's conduct has come under criticism because he discussed a  
possible immunity deal with Ms. Lewinsky without her attorney 
present. U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson concluded that 
Starr's office ``may have acted improperly'' in the matter. The 
Justice Department has advised Starr's office that it intends to 
investigate his handling of the Lewinsky case. 
</P>
<P>
	Before joining Starr in 1997, Emmick was chief of the  
30-attorney public corruption and government fraud section of the 
U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Apperson is lead counsel in the prosecution of longtime Clinton  
friend Webster Hubbell for allegedly concealing his own and Hillary 
Rodham Clinton's roles in a fraudulent Arkansas land development. 
With the Justice Department for 13 years, Apperson pioneered the 
use of civil procedures for recovering drug money paid to criminal 
defense lawyers, Starr said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	Page went to Starr's office from the staff of another  
independent counsel, David Barrett, who is prosecuting former 
Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros. Before 
that, Page spent eight years with the U.S. attorney's office in 
Tampa, Fla., where he was chief of the major crimes section. 
</P>
<P>
	The three departing deputies in Starr's office, Robert Bittman,  
Solomon Wisenberg and Jackie Bennett, all participated in the grand 
jury questioning of President Clinton Aug. 17 when he admitted -- 
after eight months of denials -- that he had inappropriate intimate 
contact with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr has raised the possibility he might turn over parts of his  
criminal investigation to the Justice Department when the 
independent counsel law expires June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Pending before Starr's office are two trials involving Hubbell,  
as well as a May 3 trial of a Virginia woman, Julie Hiatt Steele, 
who was charged with obstructing Starr's investigation of Kathleen 
Willey's claim that Clinton made an unwelcome advance on her in the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators also have to complete their probes of the FBI  
files controversy and the White House travel office firings. 
Starr's office also could decide to retry Susan McDougal on charges 
of criminal contempt for her refusals to give grand jury testimony 
in the Whitewater probe. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr declines to say how long he plans to stay on the job.

<HEADLINE> Cells May Help Parkinson's Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- A controversial surgery which implants fetal  
cells into an adult's brain have helped many Parkinson's patients 
improve brain function and move better, researchers said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers studied 38 American and two Canadian patients  
who underwent such surgery, the latest effort in the use of cells 
from aborted fetuses to stimulate brain activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The patients were randomly chosen to either receive a fetal cell  
implant or a placebo surgery, said Dr. Curt Freed of the University 
of Colorado, who led the study and presented the results at a 
meeting in Toronto of the American Academy of Neurology. 
</P>
<P>
	Parkinson's, characterized by stiffness and tremors, destroys  
the brain cells that produce dopamine, a chemical that influences 
many parts of the brain. The fetal cells are used to replace them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We simply put in new cells where others have died,'' said  
Freed, adding it was the first surgical study of its kind. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the year following the operation, more than half the  
patients who received fetal cells had a significant increase in 
levels of dopamine. But how long the improvements will continue is 
still under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	More than one million Americans suffer from Parkinson's, a  
degenerative brain disease most often found in people over 50. But 
younger people can also develop it. Actor Michael J. Fox announced 
earlier this year that he has Parkinson's. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the benefits of the operation, including better motor  
control, were in patients under 60, said Dr. Stanley Fahn, Freed's 
partner from New York's Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. Researchers 
believe it's because the aging brain is less resilient. 
</P>
<P>
	Many patients were also able to reduce or stop taking  
medication. 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto-area residents Judy Hazlett and Lynda McKenzie, who took  
part in the trials, said they struggled before volunteering for the 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I debated a long time before I decided to have the fetal  
tissue,'' said Hazlett, who was 29 when she was diagnosed with 
Parkinson's 20 years ago. ``But you have to realize it's recycled 
tissue; the woman has already decided to abort the child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hazlett said the surgery has resulted in ``little but amazing  
changes.'' She can now sleep through the night, carry a spoon 
without dropping it, and hold her head up. She is also taking less 
medication. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been 10 years since surgeons first experimented with fetal  
cells implanted in human brains. Since then, more than 100 
surgeries have been performed worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. trials, which lasted nearly five years, were funded by  
$4.5 million from the National Institutes of Health. They were the 
first to receive federal research grants in 1993, when President 
Clinton lifted a Reagan Administration ban on fetal-tissue funding.

<HEADLINE>  Gandhi Can Form India Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- India's Congress Party will be able to  
muster enough support in two days to form a minority government, 
the party's leader said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sonia Gandhi claimed to have a slight majority of 272 seats in  
the 543-member legislature and promised to deliver letters of 
support by Friday. She said questions about whether she would be 
prime minister were ``premature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President K.R. Narayanan asked Mrs. Gandhi ``to explore the  
possibility'' of forming a government -- a preliminary step giving 
Congress the first opportunity to replace the Hindu nationalist 
government and its prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who lost a 
confidence motion in parliament by one vote Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Congress Party is willing to form a government of its own  
with outside support,'' Mrs. Gandhi told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	However, many of parliament's smaller, pivotal parties that Mrs.  
Gandhi said were backing Congress met late Wednesday. They are 
pushing for a coalition backed by Congress and oppose a stand-alone 
Congress administration as proposed by Mrs. Gandhi. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot do without the Congress, but the Congress will have  
to come off its high horse. The numbers are such,'' said Amar 
Singh, spokesman of the Rashtriya Loktantrik Morcha. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of Vajpayee, who is serving as a caretaker until a  
new government is formed, attacked Mrs. Gandhi's Italian heritage, 
accused her party of offering money and jobs to sway votes, and 
challenged her numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	``No party has so far given her unconditional support,'' a  
senior leader of Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi, 51, adopted Indian citizenship 16 years after her  
marriage to Rajiv Gandhi, who was prime minister until 1989. He was 
assassinated in 1991, and his mother, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, 
was assassinated in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the budget was to be adopted without debate Wednesday,  
lawmakers opened the session by standing at their seats and yelling 
accusations of Congress bribery. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi denied the accusations. ``This is a habit of the BJP  
to accuse others of the things they in fact do,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite four adjournments, no vote was taken on the budget.  
</P>
<P>
	If no one can form what would be India's fourth government since  
1996, the country will hold its third national election in three 
years.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Principal for Day in Chicago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Michael Jordan was holding a different kind of  
court when he dropped in at Marshall Metro High School to be 
principal for a day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was told that I would be getting a visitor, but I thought it  
would be someone like Al Gore or Clinton,'' said Carol Rolowicz, 
who teaches consumer education and American history. 
</P>
<P>
	``But Michael Jordan? This is the biggest thing that's ever  
happened to this school, including when Oprah came 10 years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to get businessmen and companies to support  
education, the Chicago Public School system came up with the 
``Principal for a Day'' program. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1,150 students were awestruck during an early assembly  
Tuesday when they discovered that the 6-foot-6-inch man seated in 
front of them was ol' No. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can feel the love in this room,'' Jordan later told  
Rolowicz's class.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks that are moving substantially or trading  
heavily today on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock 
Market. 

</P>
<P>
                               *NYSE    	

</P>
<P>
 *Cadence Design Systems Inc. fell 8 3/16 to 12 5/8.    	
</P>
<P>
	The company, which sells software and services that aid the  
design of electronic products, reported operating earnings late 
Tuesday of 31 cents a share, meeting analysts' estimates. But the 
company said it expects slower revenue and earning growth for the 
remainder of 1999. Several Wall Street firms downgraded the stock. 

</P>
<P>
 *Borders Group Inc. fell 2 3/8 to 14 11/16.    	
</P>
<P>
	Chief executive Philip M. Pfeffer resigned from the nation's  
second-largest bookstore chain, and the company expects to take a 4 
cent-per-share charge against earnings because of his departure. 
Borders, which has failed to keep pace with brick-and-mortar rival 
Barnes &AMP; Noble and Internet giant Amazon.com, said its retail 
stores would post a profit of 4 to 5 cents per share for the 
quarter, but that Borders.com would lose 5 to 6 cents per share. 

</P>
<P>
 *Kaiser Aluminum rose 5/8 to 6 3/8.    	
</P>
<P>
	The aluminum processor reported a first-quarter loss of 48 cents  
a share, widely missing analysts' expected loss of 27 cents. The 
company said its results were hurt by low metal prices and lower 
shipments in all of its units. 

</P>
<P>
 *Lucent Technologies Inc. rose 4 to 58 1/4.  
</P>
<P>
 *Sprint rose 4 15/16 to 105 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent received a $780 million contract from Sprint for  
equipment and services to expand Sprint's wireless communications 
operations. On Tuesday, Sprint beat analysts' first-quarter 
earnings expectations and announced a 2-for-1 stock split. 

</P>
<P>
 *Kimberly-Clark Corp. rose 4 1/8 to 58 7/16.    	
</P>
<P>
	The paper products maker said Wednesday it earned 75 cents per  
share in the first quarter, up from 51 cents per share a year ago. 
Analysts cited strong increases in the company's profit margins, 
particularly in tissue and personal care products in North America, 
and significantly better European results. 

</P>
<P>
 *Boston Scientific rose 7 3/8 to 43 7/8.    	
</P>
<P>
	Late Tuesday, the medical device maker reported first-quarter  
net earnings of 25 cents per share, beating analysts' estimated 21 
cents, prompting several brokerage firms to upgrade the stock. 

</P>
<P>
                              *NASDAQ   	

</P>
<P>
 *Amgen Inc. fell 5 to 64.    	
</P>
<P>
	The drugmaker earned 46 cents a share in the first quarter,  
beating analysts' estimates of 44 cents. But the results were fed 
by a 30 percent growth in sales of the company's anemia drug 
Epogen. The company said they would rise only 20 percent going 
forward. 

</P>
<P>
 *Siebel Systems Inc. rose 1 7/16 at 36 15/16.    	
</P>
<P>
	The software maker's first-quarter results exceeded analysts'  
forecasts on a sharp increase in licenses and services. 
First-quarter profits were 20 cents a share, compared with 
estimates of 15 cents. Chief operating officer Pat House told Dow 
Jones the company expects the meet 1999 Wall Street estimates of 76 
cents a share. 

</P>
<P>
 *SkyTel Communications Inc. fell 1 3/4 to 15 3/16.    	
</P>
<P>
	The provider of wireless messaging systems company hired Warburg  
Dillon Read LLC to help it evaluate strategic alternatives. The 
company said it expects slower subscriber growth in the first 
quarter to dampen earnings growth for the rest of 1999. 

</P>
<P>
 *Lycos Inc. rose 27 5/8 to 101 1/2.    	
</P>
<P>
	The stock soared after a report from Media Metrix, a New York  
Internet research firm, indicated Lycos has the most-visited 
Internet portal. The report said Lycos' portal received 31.9 
million visitors in March, while Yahoo's portal received 31.2 
million visitors. Lycos has the third most popular Web site 
overall, with America Online and Microsoft sites holding on to the 
top rankings.

<HEADLINE> Left Field to Left Out for Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Barry Bonds, his left arm in a cast  
extending nearly to his armpit, says the hardest part of dealing 
with his first serious injury will be watching his team on TV. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-time NL MVP, who had missed just 20 games in his first  
six seasons with San Francisco, is on the disabled list for the 
second time in 12 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only air is invincible,'' he said Wednesday during a visit to  
the Giants' clubhouse, one day after surgery to repair a triceps 
tendon and a bone spur in his elbow. ``Last time I checked, we're 
not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors told the Giants they'll be without Bonds for a minimum  
of 10 weeks. Bonds, who in the past has healed quickly from other 
injuries, cannot accept such a timetable. 
</P>
<P>
	He says the cast will come off Friday, and he'll immediately  
begin rehab. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight-time All-Star left fielder does not expect to go on  
the Giants' road trip to Montreal, New York and Pittsburgh 
beginning next Tuesday, so he can focus on rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'd rather I stay here because I can get more done rather  
than sitting in a hotel and then going to the ballpark,'' he said. 
``What am I going to do in Montreal and Pittsburgh?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Facing two months without baseball will be the toughest thing  
for the slugger, who was batting .366 with four homers and 12 RBIs 
and an .805 slugging percentage this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's painful to watch games on TV. It's just painful to me,''  
Bonds said. ``I'll be here (in the clubhouse) with them off and on. 
I'm not supposed to be here today, but I can't sit at home. That's 
not something I can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds said doctors told him the surgery had to be done now, or  
he could have risked ending a career during which he has become the 
only major leaguer with 400 homers and 400 stolen bases. He has 415 
homers and 447 steals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew it was have the surgery or maybe never play baseball  
again,'' he said. ``The doctors said, `What do you want to do? Play 
for several more years, or just roll the dice and maybe tear the 
whole entire triceps?' You never know if you can come back from 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds first felt pain in the elbow during a series at home  
against Houston last week. The pain kept getting more intense, and 
he told Giants manager Dusty Baker about it before Friday's game at 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	He tried playing and sleeping with a rubberized sleeve on the  
elbow, but the sensation worsened. If he spent too long in the 
outfield during an inning, he needed someone to rub his arm before 
batting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew something was wrong. I just didn't know what it was,''  
he said. ``I couldn't straighten my arm out. I felt like something 
was blocking me from extending my arm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds took a quick look around the clubhouse as teammates  
dressed for Wednesday's game against the Florida Marlins. Bonds was 
wearing a T-shirt and sweatpants. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to wear sweats, and I don't like to do that,'' he said.  
``I have to get back to work. Because this is what I do for a 
living.''

<HEADLINE> Cendant Corp. Earnings Dip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cendant Corp., the franchiser of names like  
Ramada hotels and Avis car rentals, experienced a large boost in 
net earnings in the first quarter thanks to the sale of a software 
subsidiary. Without the sale, earnings fell slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	Cendant, which has been bruised by an accounting scandal and a  
failed merger with American Bankers Insurance Group Inc., posted 
net earnings of $362 million in the three months ended March 31, or 
43 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	The net figure included a one-time gain of $192.7 million, or 22  
cents per share, from the sale of Cendant Software. Without the 
gain, earnings would have been $169.3 million, compared with $172.9 
million in the same period a year ago. Analysts had expected 
earnings of 19 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose 16.5 percent to $1.30 billion from $1.12 billion.  
The company attributed the rise in revenues largely to the 
acquisition of National Parking Corporation of Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	Results were announced after the financial markets closed  
Wednesday. Shares of Cendant rose 68 3/4 cents to $18.56 1/4 in trading 
on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Shooting Comes Amid Colo. Gun Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The shooting rampage at a suburban high school  
prompted state lawmakers today to kill major gun bills, including 
one that would have helped gun owners obtain concealed weapons 
permits. 
</P>
<P>
	Local government leaders had criticized the concealed gun bill,  
already passed by the state Senate. A House panel had planned to 
take up the measure today, but after Tuesday's shootings 
legislative leaders decided to postpone action. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the sponsor of the concealed weapons bill went a step  
farther. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pulling it,'' said Republican House Majority Leader Doug  
Dean. 
</P>
<P>
	That means his measure will die when the Legislature adjourns on  
May 5. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would have required sheriffs to grant concealed weapons  
permits if applicants passed a number of conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Dean said Tuesday that the tragedy in suburban Littleton might  
have been offset if a faculty member, or administrator, had been 
armed. 
</P>
<P>
	But state Rep. Russell George said he had received calls  
expressing the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm getting e-mails from people saying: `See what happens when  
you have guns? And you legislators are talking about allowing more 
guns in society, and here's the harm that comes,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Senate version of the bill, people wouldn't have been  
allowed to carry their handguns on school grounds or into schools, 
government buildings or bars. 
</P>
<P>
	State Rep. Gary McPherson, sponsor of a separate bill to let a  
state law override local ordinances on gun control, also withdrew 
his bill today.

<HEADLINE> Workman Has Been a Godsend to Bucks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- George Karl admits it was pure chance, not  
genius, that landed Haywoode Workman, who could be the missing 
piece of the Milwaukee Bucks' playoff puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
	Workman signed a 10-day contract last month while the Bucks were  
spiraling through a four-game losing streak following the trade of 
point guard Terrell Brandon for Sam Cassell, who's missed most of 
the season with a bum ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first game in 29 months, Workman, who had three knee  
surgeries during his layoff, nearly had a triple-double, tallying 
nine points, eight rebounds and eight assists in a blowout of 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten days later, he scored 19 points in a victory at Minnesota,  
and the Bucks' ship was steadied, their hopes of ending a 
seven-year playoff drought rekindled. 
</P>
<P>
	Workman's presence has allowed Vinny Del Negro, a shooting guard  
by trade, to go back to coming off the bench, where he's been much 
more effective. 
</P>
<P>
	``Haywoode's one of the unsung players on this team,'' guard Ray  
Allen said. ``He can pass, shoot, he's a great teammate to have on 
the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A brilliant move, right?  
</P>
<P>
	``You don't make personnel decisions that fit like this one  
fit,'' said Karl, the Bucks' first-year coach who authorized the 
trades of Brandon and Tyrone Hill despite a 12-5 start. ``I can't 
say we knew that was going to happen. That was just luck. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a chemistry standpoint, from a team standpoint, the fit  
is unbelievable,'' Karl added. ``He brings leadership and 
toughness, things that we needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karl hopes to have Cassell back in time for the playoffs, and  
he'd be delighted to find playing time for both of his new point 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
	``My feeling is Sam will play this year,'' Karl said. ``But  
that's just a feel, a sense, maybe a qualified dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Or a prayer.  
</P>
<P>
	``Sam has to get over his caution. He's very cautious right now.  
That's OK. Before he gets on the court, he's going to have to knock 
some bodies around in practice,'' Karl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassell re-injured his ankle in his first game with the Bucks on  
March 21, and he's reluctant to push it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I was able to play and I was, it was just a freak  
thing that happened,'' said Cassell, who began doing non-contact 
drills again last week. ``It's not well enough for me to play, but 
I'm shooting for the last week of the season. Right now I feel good 
mentally, but physically it's not there. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my career. I don't want this to linger into next  
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As soon as Cassell is healthy, he'll supplant Workman as the  
starter, Karl said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sam's going to be our starting point guard someday, and the  
sooner we get him in there, the sooner we're moving in the right 
direction,'' Karl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Workman knows this is a temp job and doesn't care.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's no pressure on me,'' he said. ``I'm just a fill-in,  
and when Sam comes back, he'll take the spot. I don't mind that. I 
just wanted to play some.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After all, there were those who said he'd never play again.  
</P>
<P>
	Workman, 33, tore his anterior cruciate ligament in his left  
knee on Nov. 9, 1996, while playing for the Indiana Pacers. After 
three operations, he wanted to make his comeback with the Pacers, 
whom he helped lead to the Eastern Conference finals in 1994, but a 
groin pull in the shortened training camp led to his release. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never gave up hope,'' Workman said. ``I wanted to give  
myself an honest chance after the injury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And now he's helping revive the Bucks along with his career.  
</P>
<P>
	``George has basically made it real easy,'' Workman said. ``He  
calls the plays, I run them. This team's trying to turn history 
around here. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm here to help.''

<HEADLINE> Wood Make Wrigley Appearance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Oh, could the Chicago Cubs have used Kerry Wood  
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood made his first appearance at Wrigley Field since undergoing  
reconstructive surgery April 8 on his pitching elbow. He got the 
stitches out of his right arm, but is still wearing a brace. He'll 
travel with the team while he rehabilitates, and hopes to be ready 
for opening day 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know what lies ahead of me as far as conditioning and  
getting back into shape,'' said Wood, who was in the Cubs locker 
room in street clothes after Chicago's 10-3 loss to Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I want to pitch again, I've got to be prepared to do that  
stuff,'' said Wood, who said he weighs about 231 pounds, six above 
his playing weight. ``I'm prepared to pitch and I want to pitch, so 
I'm going to go out, get more work done and get back into shape to 
do what has to be done to come in here next season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was another game against the Astros on a cold, windy spring  
day at Wrigley that rocketed Wood to prominence. On May 6, 1998, in 
just his fifth start, he tied a major league record by striking out 
20. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-hander went on to finish 13-6 despite missing the  
final month of the season with a sore elbow, and won NL Rookie of 
the Year honors. 
</P>
<P>
	He tore the ulnar collateral ligament in his first start of  
spring training. During ``Tommy John surgery,'' a ligament was 
transplanted into his elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be stronger than it was before I injured it,''  
Wood said. ``So I'm excited about going out there with a healthy 
arm and seeing what I can do next.''

	Leno, whose ``Tonight Show'' is a consistent ratings winner over  
Letterman's ``Late Show,'' will be behind the wheel of the

<HEADLINE> Congress Reacts to School Shootings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Solving the deadly combination of teen-agers,  
schools and guns rests with students, parents and educators, not 
Congress, lawmakers say. 
</P>
<P>
	The House's top Democrat, Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, said  
Wednesday ``the answer lies somewhere in the hopelessness and the 
hateful hearts of the children who have lost their way and in the 
path that brought them to this despondent act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some lawmakers quickly dug up stalled proposals to make schools  
safer but, in doing so, acknowledged that federal officials only 
can do so much to prevent school violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen people were killed Tuesday at a Littleton, Colo., high  
school by a pair of students described as outcasts among their 
classmates. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is, I'm sure, no simple solution, but we must pledge  
ourselves to doing what we can,'' said Sen. Wayne Allard, R-Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben Nighthorse Campbell, the state's other Republican senator,  
reminisced about the time when youngsters settled a score with fist 
fights or drag races after school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know when these youngsters got so accustomed to  
killing each other,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., talked up her proposal to encourage  
states to detain juveniles for at least 24 hours for bringing guns 
to schools. 
</P>
<P>
	But she said parents must be more involved with their children.  
</P>
<P>
	``We need to talk to our children after they get home from  
school every night, at the dinner table, on weekends to find out 
what they're thinking, what they're feeling,'' Dunn said. ``The 
solution is found with our children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., wants to help schools buy new  
security systems developed by Sandia National Laboratories, 
including electronic IDs for students, instant drug detection 
devices and mechanisms to prevent false fire alarms. 
</P>
<P>
	An Albuquerque, N.M., high school that is using some of the new  
technology has had dramatic declines in violent, property and other 
crimes since 1997, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun control advocates renewed calls for stricter gun laws. ``A  
teen-ager can only do so much damage with his fists,'' said Sen. 
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents rejected the pleadings.  
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., a National Rifle Association member, said  
the problems that create ``young demons'' like the Colorado 
shooters ``go far deeper'' than access to guns and that the answers 
lie outside of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``The solution's going to have to come from our schools,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said she has asked  
Attorney General Janet Reno to waive matching-fund requirements for 
communities that are seeking federal grants to hire and assign law 
enforcement officers to their schools.

<HEADLINE> Globe's Bud Collins Wins APSE Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Bud Collins, a Boston Globe correspondent and NBC  
television commentator, has won the Red Smith Award presented by 
The Associated Press Sports Editors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's probably the biggest honor I've had,'' Collins said. ``I  
think to be voted for something by your peers is always an honor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collins has written for the Globe since 1963 and is best known  
for his tennis coverage. But he has written about everything from 
baseball to boxing. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1974, he led the way for writers showcasing their talents as  
broadcasters when he left the Globe as a full-time employee to do 
television work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bud is Mr. Tennis,'' said Don Skwar, the Globe's assistant  
managing editor for sports. ``He's known not just in the country 
but all over the world as the preeminent writer and voice of the 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a commentator, he also is known for the clever nicknames he  
gives tennis stars. For example, Steffi Graf is known to Collins 
fans as ``Fraulein Forehand'' while Venus and Serena Williams are 
the ``Sisters Sledgehammer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, who describes himself as a ``scribbler and a babbler,''  
was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve sports journalists were nominated for the Red Smith  
Award, which will be presented at the APSE's national convention in 
Phoenix on June 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1981, the award has been given to writers who have made  
``major contributions to sports journalism.'' It is named for the 
former New York Times columnist.

<HEADLINE> `60 Minutes' Does Well in Ratings / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Nielsen Media Research ratings brought smiles  
for some, frowns for others at CBS News this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``60 Minutes'' tied with ``Frasier'' as the most-watched  
prime-time show last week, Nielsen said Tuesday. It was the second 
time this season the venerable newsmagazine has topped the ratings, 
the first time that has happened in five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the network's decision to send ``CBS Evening News''  
anchor Dan Rather to report from Belgrade last week failed to pay 
off in the ratings. ABC anchor Peter Jennings and NBC anchor Tom 
Brokaw stayed in New York while Rather traveled. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS continued its evening news ratings slump, finishing well  
behind ABC's ``World News Tonight'' and the ``NBC Nightly News.'' 
CBS saw a 2 percent increase in its news viewership over the 
previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jennings-led ABC broadcast finished with a 7.6 rating and 17  
share, NBC had a 7.3 rating and 16 share and CBS was at 6.4 and 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Reruns dominated the prime-time landscape last week and,  
typically, many TV viewers went elsewhere. CBS won the week with an 
8.3 rating and 14 share, NBC had a 7.7 rating and 13 share, ABC was 
at 6.8 and 12 and Fox was at 6.0 and 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Two specials pleased executives at ABC and UPN. ``David Blaine:  
Magic Man,'' the one-hour ABC show about the magician, finished 
tied for 15th in the week's ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scared Straight! 20 Years Later,'' UPN's update of a memorable  
20-year-old documentary about prison inmates trying to convince 
delinquent youth to stay away from crime, was the network's 
highest-rated Thursday night telecast ever. 
</P>
<P>
	It enabled UPN, with its 2.2 rating and 4 share for the week, to  
pull closer than usual to the WB, which had a 2.7 rating and 5 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of April 12-18, the top 10 shows, their networks  
and ratings were: ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 12.7; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 
12.7; ``Friends,'' NBC, 12.0; ``CBS Sunday Movie: Having Our Say,'' 
CBS, 11.8; ``ER,'' NBC, 11.6; ``Just Shoot Me'' special, NBC, 11.4; 
``Will &AMP; Grace,'' NBC, 11.3; ``Touched By an Angel,'' CBS, 11.2; 
``Law and Order,'' NBC, 10.4; ``Dateline NBC-Monday,'' NBC, 10.0; 
``The Practice,'' ABC, 10.0.

<HEADLINE> NFL Picks Los Angeles Coliseum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- When Michael Ovitz proposed bringing pro  
football back to the Coliseum several years ago, he got a cold 
shoulder from the NFL and was told to look for another site. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, after moving his act down the freeway to suburban Carson,  
the Hollywood deal-maker is back where he started. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz and his backers, who recently dropped their proposal to  
build a stadium in Carson, are engaged in a duel for the league's 
32nd franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	As expected, NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue announced Tuesday  
that the league intends to put a team in the Coliseum, with the 
stadium remodel and franchise price expected to reach $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Left hanging was the question of who would remodel the  
76-year-old stadium and own the franchise, a decision the NFL 
expects to make within 45 days or so. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Coliseum Partners, headed by developer Ed Roski, will  
provide the competition for Ovitz's group, with a possibility that 
other potential owners will emerge. 
</P>
<P>
	Roski has pushed the Coliseum for the past three years, but the  
NFL team owners didn't want to be locked into exclusive 
negotiations with one group, so they also kept Ovitz in the 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Four and one-half years ago, I came to the league when the  
teams left here and made a presentation for this (Coliseum) area 
for a combination stadium and new sports arena where the basketball 
and hockey teams would play,'' Ovitz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was suggested to me by several owners of the National  
Football League that they would never come back to the Coliseum and 
suggested we focus on somewhere else. They seemed to have changed 
their point of view on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The league owners voted 29-2 last month to award the expansion  
team to the Los Angeles area, the nation's second-biggest TV 
market, on a conditional basis. They set a Sept. 15 deadline for 
reaching agreement with whatever site and group they chose for the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Houston is waiting if a deal can't be reached in Los  
Angeles, comments by NFL officials and civic leaders Tuesday at the 
Coliseum appeared to solidify prospects LA actually will get the 
team, expected to begin play in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Roski seemed pleased after meeting with NFL officials and the 11  
team owners on hand for Tuesday's press conference at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've picked LA, they've picked the Coliseum, they're not  
going to have an auction, and they've given us some guidelines,'' 
Roski said. 
</P>
<P>
	He had thought the new franchise was going to go to the highest  
bidder, but Tagliabue instead said there would be a fixed price 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of all the things said today, I think that was one of the best  
things we could hear,'' Roski said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue said the aim was ``to make the new Coliseum a  
reality,'' and added, ``If we succeed in doing that, we will be 
talking about a project that will involve, in round numbers, $1 
billion of investment, in terms of the stadium, the Exposition Park 
area (site of the stadium) and the ownership of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are looking for business plans, including stadium designs  
and site development plans, within the next 30-45 days, which puts 
us before our league meetings on May 25-26,'' the commissioner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been speculation Roski and Ovitz would combine their  
efforts to get a team. 
</P>
<P>
	While Roski said Ovitz would be welcome to join the New Coliseum  
Partners, Ovitz said, ``I don't know anything about putting the 
groups together. I know what we've been charged with individually. 
We both had separate meetings (with NFL officials) this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``You clearly heard what the commissioner said, which is that he  
wants to focus on a business plan and a public-private partnership. 
They made the decision that they want to try to develop the 
Coliseum, and as far as I'm concerned, that's fantastic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue seemed to think the chance of other groups joining the  
franchise competition was remote, noting that Roski and Ovitz have 
a significant head start. 
</P>
<P>
	``(But) if other people with similar qualifications were to  
knock on my door or the mayor's or Mark's door, I think they ought 
to at least be heard,'' the commissioner said, referring to Mayor 
Richard Riordan and councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the price tag will be steep to bring a team back to the  
Coliseum, abandoned first by the Rams and then by the Raiders, 
taxpayers apparently won't be stuck with a big bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all understand the reality of taxes in California since  
someone named Jarvis came on the national scene,'' Tagliabue said, 
referring to Howard Jarvis, who began a successful grassroots 
movement to cut taxes in California years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``But by the same token,'' the commissioner continued, ``this  
has to be a public-private partnership in order to succeed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The historic Coliseum would be completely gutted inside and  
rebuilt under Roski's initial proposal, which might be modified 
now. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz recent proposal featured a shopping mall and stadium  
complex to be constructed on a former landfill in Carson, 12 miles 
south of the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL owners, however, apparently favored the Coliseum because  
of its proximity to downtown, which is undergoing a bit of a 
renaissance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coliseum was the centerpiece of the 1932 and 1984 Olympics,  
and also the site of the NFL's first Super Bowl. The Rams played 
there before moving first to Anaheim, then to St. Louis, and then 
the Raiders played there until returning to Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles area has been without a pro football team since  
the Rams and Raiders both left following the 1994 season. UCLA also 
was a Coliseum tenant before moving to the Rose Bowl, and the USC 
Trojans, whose campus is nearby, remain the stadium's lone tenant.

<HEADLINE> Internet Utopia Under Scrutiny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- He sees a new nation rising from giant  
concrete platforms anchored to reefs between the Cayman Islands and 
Central America. 
</P>
<P>
	He sees a free-enterprise Mecca of finance, insurance and  
medicine -- a tourist destination with casinos and a golf course, a 
majestic city-state in the middle of the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
	Meet His Royal Highness Prince Lazarus Long, ruler of what he  
envisions as the emerging nation of New Utopia. For now, this brave 
new land exists only on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people retire to golf, others to fish. I just wanted to  
start a country,'' said Long, who turns out to be 67-year-old Tulsa 
resident Howard Turney. 
</P>
<P>
	Long realizes some people consider his project a bizarre  
fantasy. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, meanwhile, 
considers New Utopia a vehicle to potentially cheat investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC filed a complaint in federal court this month accusing  
Long of misrepresentations and omissions in securities offerings 
over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Michael Burrage issued an emergency  
restraining order on April 9 to prevent Long from selling 
additional $1,500 ``citizenship bonds'' on his Web site at 
www.new-utopia.com. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's making it seem that it's a riskless endeavor, a way to  
find riches and peace,'' said Harold Degenhardt, the SEC's district 
administrator in Fort Worth, Texas. ``You might as well put a sign 
on your head saying 'sucker.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Long denies wrongdoing and brushes off SEC allegations that a  
$350 million bond offering by New Utopia was phony. No bonds were 
ever sold, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC gave Long until the end of April to hand over his  
passport, an accounting of investor funds and jurisdiction of any 
investor money moved outside the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Ben Willey Jr. of Oklahoma City said Long will  
comply. ``We intend to just get everything whipped into shape so to 
speak because we have a feasible, doable project,'' Willey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Money contributed by would-be New Utopia citizens totaled about  
$22,000, Long said. He would not divulge their names, saying he has 
a fiduciary duty to protect their privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	His vision for New Utopia encompasses a population of 4,000  
people living on 284 square miles of concrete blocks situated in 
the sea 115 miles west of the Cayman Islands. About 600 citizens 
have signed on so far, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want it to be a paradise without an intrusive government,  
where you have freedom as long as you don't hurt anyone else,'' 
Long said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others appear to share his vision of a politician-free haven  
boasting speedy patents for inventors, experimental treatments for 
the sick and privacy for financial dealings. The only taxes will be 
a 15-percent import duty. 
</P>
<P>
	New Utopia's organizers concede that skeptics think them crazy  
for trying to build hotels, an airport, a university and other 
structures in the middle of the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
	Long plans to unveil architects' sketches of New Utopia and  
introduce his appointed governing ``cabinet'' at an April 30 
ceremony at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. He says he wants to start 
construction by June. 
</P>
<P>
	Long is no stranger to unusual ventures. Previous projects  
include shrimp farming, a method to freeze aborted fetuses and 
sales of a human growth hormone thought to ward off aging. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Postal Service in 1985 filed a complaint against his  
Cheon Star Educational Trust, which sold registrations of stars in 
the names of donors. Long agreed to stop indicating that Cheon had 
the backing of the government or scientific organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	The flag for New Utopia -- a white star surrounded by a gold  
wreath on a field of blue -- hangs above Long's desk. 
</P>
<P>
	British businessman Ian Sawyer, who has been appointed minister  
of corporations for New Utopia, said the time was right for the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is an increasing awareness of government intrusion  
throughout the Western world in people's private and public 
affairs, and a growing resentment to that,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Giants' Bonds Out At Least 10 Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- When Giants general manager Brian Sabean  
was asked if he'll seek a trade because Barry Bonds is sidelined 
for at least 2 1/2 months, he ridiculed the notion of trying to 
replace the three-time NL MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	``No way,'' Sabean said. ``Unless Willie Mays wants to get in  
shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds' locker was cleaned out Tuesday. His empty cubicle seemed  
to capture the mood of the Giants after they lost 7-2 to Florida a 
few hours after Bonds had surgery on his throwing arm -- his first 
serious injury in 12 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to go out and get the job done,'' said San Francisco  
starter Chris Brock, the loser against the Marlins. ``It's not 
going to be as easy without him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants' All-Star left fielder had surgery at Recovery Inn in  
Menlo Park to repair a triceps tendon and a bone spur in his left 
elbow. He was placed on the 15-day disabled list for only the 
second time in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds was placed in an elbow splint and will be fitted with a  
brace this week. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the Giants, one of the NL's best hitting teams, will be  
without their most dangerous hitter for a minimum of 10 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds, an eight-time All-Star and seven-time Gold Glove winner,  
was batting .366 with 12 RBIs and four home runs. He had a 
league-leading .805 slugging percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's probably one of the largest challenges I've faced since  
I've been manager here,'' Dusty Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Giants trainer Mark Letendre said the expected recovery period  
was based on several factors, including Bonds' past ability to heal 
quickly from injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hopeful it will be on the shorter end of 10 weeks rather  
than the longer end,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stan Conte, the Giants' assistant athletic trainer, observed the  
surgery and said the bone spur and damaged tendon tissue were right 
on top of each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tissue looked better than we feared, but not as good as we  
hoped,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first inkling of a problem came Friday during batting  
practice in Phoenix. Bonds told Baker his left elbow was bothering 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker dismissed speculation the injury occurred during or just  
after a bench-clearing brawl Friday night against the Arizona 
Diamondbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Letendre said the injury was from ``chronic overuse.''  
</P>
<P>
	``In this case, the injury just happened to catch up with  
Barry,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds' only other stint on the disabled list came with  
Pittsburgh in 1992 because of a strained right side. He has missed 
just 22 games since coming to the Giants before the 1993 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds sat out Sunday's game against the Diamondbacks, then was  
out of the lineup again for Monday night's game against the 
Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, he underwent an MRI that revealed the problems, but  
decided to seek a second opinion from Ting, who confirmed the 
diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker called it a ``devastating blow.''  
</P>
<P>
	``At the same time, we have to do what we have to do. We have to  
carry on -- and I don't think Barry would want it any other way,'' 
Baker said. ``It still hurts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stan Javier is taking Bonds' place in left field, while Ellis  
Burks so far has taken over the No. 3 spot in the batting order. 
</P>
<P>
	``Barry Bonds is Barry Bonds,'' Javier said. ``I can't play his  
game. I'm just going to play Stan Javier's game.''

<HEADLINE> Congress Supports Award for Parks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rosa Parks is getting the gold.  
</P>
<P>
	Congress voted Tuesday to give the 86-year-old Parks a  
Congressional Gold Medal, its highest civilian award, for an act of 
defiance more than 40 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Often hailed as the ``first lady'' or ``mother'' of the civil  
rights movement, Parks was tired after a day's work as a seamstress 
in Montgomery, Ala., on a December day in 1955 and refused to give 
up her seat to a white man on a segregated city bus. 
</P>
<P>
	Her arrest set off a lengthy bus boycott by blacks that lasted  
until the Supreme Court declared Montgomery's bus segregation law 
unconstitutional and it was changed. The boycott was led by the 
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., a local minister at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``One brave act of a humble seamstress triggered an avalanche of  
change which helped our country fulfill its commitment to equal 
rights for all Americans,'' said House Minority Leader Dick 
Gephardt, D-Mo. ``For her leadership and her example, Rosa Parks 
deserves to be honored with the Congressional Gold Medal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House voted 424-1 in favor of the measure, one day after the  
Senate passed it without dissent. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, was the 
only lawmaker to vote against the bill, which President Clinton is 
expected to sign. 
</P>
<P>
	``This courageous act changed her life and our nation forever,''  
said Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla. ``Passage of this bill will 
be our contribution to her legacy today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parks, an Alabama native, watched the debate on television from  
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mrs. Parks is very excited to have this honor,'' said Anita  
Peek, executive director of the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute 
for Self-Development. Parks co-founded the nonprofit group in 1987 
to help young people in Detroit, where she now lives. 
</P>
<P>
	She moved there in 1957 after losing the seamstress' job and her  
family was harassed and threatened. She joined the staff of Rep. 
John Conyers, D-Mich., in 1965 and worked there until retiring in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
	She now travels the country lecturing about civil rights.  
</P>
<P>
	A guest at Clinton's State of the Union address in January,  
Parks has received numerous awards, including the Presidential 
Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian award, and the 
Spingarn Award, the NAACP's top civil rights honor. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers initially used the Congressional Gold Medal to honor  
military leaders but began using it during the 20th century to 
recognize excellence in a range of fields, including the arts, 
athletics, politics, science and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	The first such medal was approved in March 1776 for George  
Washington for ``wise and spirited conduct'' during the 
Revolutionary War. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 320 medals have been awarded.  
</P>
<P>
	Recent honorees include Frank Sinatra, Mother Teresa, the Rev.  
Billy Graham, South African President Nelson Mandela and the 
``Little Rock Nine,'' the group that braved threats and jeers from 
white mobs to integrate Central High School in Little Rock, Ark., 
in 1957.

<HEADLINE> Big Indoor Auto Track Is Planned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IMPERIAL, Pa. (AP) -- As early as 2002, drivers could have a new  
place to race and they'd never even have to worry about rain. 
</P>
<P>
	A West Virginia company hopes to build a first-of-its-kind  
indoor speedway that could seat as many as 120,000 and would allow 
racing in the Northeast in the dead of winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be the greatest thing since axle grease,'' three-time  
Winston Cup champion Cale Yarborough said of the planned $300 
million track. 
</P>
<P>
	``Drivers have talked about this for years, but I didn't know if  
we would ever see it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The track, to be financed mostly from private sources, is  
planned by Brant Motorsports for a 145-acre tract adjacent to 
Pittsburgh International Airport. Brant, based in Morgantown, 
W.Va., already is involved in sponsorship of cars in NASCAR and the 
Indy Racing League. 
</P>
<P>
	The land is owned by Allegheny County and would be leased to  
Brant. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2.6 million square-foot auto racing arena -- there's a term  
never used before -- would contain a 1-mile banked oval track 
covered by a 40-acre roof 135 feet in height and made of a 
synthetic material.

and the most money,'' Brant said. ``Nobody has ever tried to do 
anything like this. But the discussion in auto racing has always 
been that we need one of these.''

<HEADLINE> Nabisco Earnings Drop 35 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARSIPPANY, N.J. (AP) -- Declining sales and restructuring costs  
fueled a 35 percent drop in first-quarter earnings for food 
conglomerate Nabisco Holdings Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The results reported Wednesday by the maker of Oreo cookies,  
Ritz crackers, Life Savers candy and Planters nuts were in line 
with Wall Street expectations. But its shares fell 56 1/4 cents to 
$39.87 1/2 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Nabisco earned $36 million, or 13 cents a share, for the  
January-March period versus $55 million, or 21 cents a share, a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The lower results reflected $15 million in pre-tax expenses for  
restructuring programs begun in June and December of last year. 
That trimmed 4 cents a share from the reported earnings figure. 
</P>
<P>
	Without that expense, Nabisco's earnings of 17 cents a share  
matched the average expected by analysts surveyed by First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales declined 6 percent to $1.85 billion from $1.96 billion in  
the year-ago quarter, although sales from ongoing businesses rose 1 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Increased sales in Nabisco's U.S. biscuits, snacks and grocery  
products businesses were offset by a 5 percent drop in 
international sales, due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates in 
Brazil and Canada, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Biscuit company sales, including core cookie brands such as  
Oreo, Chips Ahoy! and Nutter Butter, increased 2 percent driven by 
product promotions. 
</P>
<P>
	Nabisco said sales from ongoing U.S. food businesses increased 7  
percent led by significant gains for Planters nuts and Life Savers 
candies. However, the division's total sales fell 18 percent 
because the absence of divested brands like College Inn broths, 
margarine and Egg Beaters. 
</P>
<P>
	International sales declined 5 percent. The company said gains  
in Mexico, the Caribbean and Asia were not enough to offset 
declines in a number of Latin American markets caused by economic 
uncertainty and the impact of unfavorable currency rates.

<HEADLINE> College To Offer E-Commerce Degree </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST CHESTER, Pa. (AP) -- West Chester University plans to offer  
the first master of business administration program in the 
Philadelphia area to have a focus on electronic commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Fiorentino, the dean of the university's business school,  
said corporate executives who reviewed the proposed curriculum were 
impressed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is good,'' Fiorentino said the executives told him.  
``Hurry up and get it out there because it is needed now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The program is scheduled to begin this fall with classes meeting  
at night. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael J. Emmi, the president of Systems &AMP; Computer Technology  
Corp. in Malvern, has been talking for some time about how 
electronic commerce, or ``e-commerce,'' is causing a revolution in 
business. He graduates of the new MBA program will probably be 
snapped up quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I predict it is going to be an enormous success,'' Emmi said.  
</P>
<P>
	David Houseman, the vice president of advanced technology at  
Unisys Corp. in Blue Bell, said not every company sells to 
consumers online, but companies are increasingly dealing with each 
other electronically. He said companies are taking orders and 
tracking them online. And many companies are using corporate 
intranets in which employees file travel reports and other 
documents electronically. 
</P>
<P>
	``The same technology is used whether it's external or  
internal,'' said Houseman, who was one of the executives who 
reviewed the program's curriculum. ``Knowing how to use it can 
reduce costs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	E-commerce programs are being offered at a small but growing  
number of college nationwide in response to demand from students 
and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Erik Brynjolfsson, a professor at the Sloan School of Management  
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said more than 200 
students signed up for the e-commerce course he teaches, even 
though there was only room for 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Brynjolfsson said although high-tech companies first recognized  
the potential of e-commerce, even well-established Fortune 500 
companies are turning to the concept now. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have realized that the Internet is not just a sideshow  
but is affecting every business in America,'' Brynjolfsson said.
