<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Reported Visit of US Congressman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Iran has denied the report that
it agreed to a visit of U.S. Democrat congressman Tom Lantos to
Iran, the evening daily Etelaat reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Foreign Ministry has never issued permission for
Lantos to visit Iran, the ministry's spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi
was quoted as saying. But he did not say why.
</P>
<P>
Iran was reported to have agreed with Lantos' visit to the
country after the U.S. congressman expressed his interest in
visiting Iran following the address of Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami to the American people.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that Lantos, a member of the House
International Relations Committee, sent a letter to Iranian
President Mohammad Khatami on Thursday when Khatami's interview
with the Cable News Network was broadcast.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. congressman intended to see whether there was a basis
for the United States and Iran to improve their strained
relations, after Khatami called for a people-to-people dialogue
instead of a government-to-government one, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Etelaat reported that Lantos' last visit to Iran happened in
1978, one year before the Islamic Revolution, which ousted the
late pro-American Shah's regime.
</P>
<P>
Washington and Tehran severed diplomatic ties in 1980 and
remained sworn enemies after Iranian students occupied the
American Embassy in Tehran and held its staff hostages for more
than one year.
</P>
<P>
However, secret contacts between the two governments continued
through the Swiss Embassy in Tehran, which takes care of American
interests in Iran. The latest contact was Washington's demand for
direct talks between the two governments earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Foreign diplomats here noted that there are many hurdles for
the two countries to clear before they can take substantial steps
in improving relations.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Continue Investigating Basayev's Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prosecutor General Yury
Skuratov said Russia will continue to investigate the crimes of
Chechen field commander Shamil Basayev.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor told a press conference Monday that the warrant
for Basayev's arrest issued by the Prosecutor General's Office in
1995 remains in effect.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came at a time when Basayev, the first deputy
minister of Chechnya, was asked to form a new cabinet by the Chechen
president who dismissed the current government on January 1.
</P>
<P>
Skuratov said Basayev is "a person charged with aggravated
crimes, including terrorism."
</P>
<P>
He said Basayev headed a Chechen unit that attacked the town of
Budyonnovsk in Stavropol territory in 1995. The attackers held
several hundred people hostage for several days at a hospital.
</P>
<P>
The investigation of the perpetrators of this crime has been
singled out as a separate case, which involves Commander of the
so-called Dedayev Army General Salman Raduyev and other Chechen
field commanders, he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government to Fight Drug Use in Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- In an effort to rid prisons
of drugs, the U.S. government may withhold federal funds from
state prisons that fail to report the extent of illegal drug use
among inmates, The New York Times reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The information the prisons provide is to be used to create a
baseline to measure their progress in reducing inmate drug use,
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton was scheduled Monday to sign a
directive, a copy of which was obtained by the Times.
</P>
<P>
The document reflects the administration's belief that crimping
the supply of drugs in prison will cut the demand for them after
the convicts are released, the Times said.
</P>
<P>
"With more than half the individuals in our criminal justice
system estimated to have a substance abuse problem, promoting
coerced abstinence within the criminal justice system offers us a
unique opportunity to break the cycle of crime and drugs," the
document says.
</P>
<P>
A report last week by the National Center on Addiction and
Substance Abuse at Columbia University estimated that alcohol and
illegal drugs contributed to the incarceration of 80 percent of
the 1.7 million inmates in the nation's prisons. The report said
that the majority of them were not being treated for addiction
before being released.
</P>
<P>
The administration has increased to 42 from 32 the number of
drug treatment centers in federal prisons and more than tripled
the number of federal inmates undergoing substance abuse treatment
-- from 5,450 in 1993 to 19,943 in the last fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton plan also proposes that Attorney General Janet Reno
draft legislation allowing states to use federal money earmarked
for prison construction to test and treat prisoners and parolees
for drugs.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Determined to Improve Relations With Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Georgian leadership is
determined to resolve all disputes with Russia through
negotiations, Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze said today,
the Interfax news agency reported from Tbilisi.
</P>
<P>
In his latest statement broadcast by the national radio,
Shevardnadze said there are several disputes over economic,
financial, border and other issues between Russia and all
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries, but these
problems should be resolved through fair negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Georgian-Russian military talks held last
week, Shevardnadze said that a lot of problems which emerged there
may take several years to be settled.
</P>
<P>
The Georgian president described the visit by a Russian
military delegation headed by chief of the Main Department of
International Military Cooperation Colonel-General Leonid Ivashov
to Georgia last week as "one more step forward" on the way of
solving the problems accumulated in Georgian-Russian relations.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze in the radio also explained his remark on January
2 that Georgia would not refuse to use the "Bosnian format" to
settle the regional conflicts in full accordance with the U.N.
Charter.
</P>
<P>
He once again said it would be expedient to apply such measures
on Abkhazia if the "Georgian-Abkhazian talks, which have lasted
for more than four years, fail to bring about any results."
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Ministry on January 6 stated that Russia
does not agree to settle the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict by using
military forces and that military means could only deteriorate the
situation and lead to more bloodshed.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Back Baltic Membership in NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States and the
three Baltic nations will sign a formal charter later this week to
explicitly support efforts by Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania to
join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
However, in a report Sunday, the New York Times quoted U.S.
officials as saying that the document, called the Charter of
Partnership, does not promise membership, which is only decided by
the alliance.
</P>
<P>
The document will not pledge the U.S. to the defense of the
Baltic countries, but embody a moral and political commitment to
the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the
three countries.
</P>
<P>
Presidents of the three countries will join U.S. President
Bill Clinton on Friday in a White House signing ceremony, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The charter promised the Baltic nations that Washington will do
everything possible to get them ready to join NATO and support
their efforts to do so.
</P>
<P>
"For the Clinton Administration, this public display of
commitment will be the most formal demonstration to date that
America's plans for Europe's future are not limited to the first
round of NATO expansion," the New York Times said.
</P>
<P>
Russia has strongly protested the alliance's enlargement and
warned against any expansion into the Baltics.
</P>
<P>
Washington, however, insists that NATO's door is open to any
countries in Europe, including the Baltics.

<HEADLINE> Germany: 200 Mln Marks for East European Holocaust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The German government today
announced that it would pay 200 million marks (110 million U.S.
dollars) in compensation for Holocaust survivors in eastern
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Friedrich Bohl, head of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's office, said
in a statement that during the four-year period from 1999 to 2002,
Bonn would each year provide 50 million marks (28 million dollars)
for a special foundation run by the Jewish Claims Conference (JCC)
to help survivors.
</P>
<P>
Bohl worked out the concrete terms with the JCC last week,
which is a New York-based body founded in 1951 to represent Jewish
claimants living outside Israel.
</P>
<P>
The JCC and the foundation will decide on how to disburse the
aid to the Holocaust survivors in eastern Europe. However, only
about 18,000 people who had so far not yet received any personal
compensation from Germany are entitled to the aid.
</P>
<P>
According to Bohl, Bonn intended to continue with its own
separate projects for Nazi victims in eastern Europe, in which it
has since 1991 paid out a total of 1.8 billion marks (1.0 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Bonn has insisted on collective compensation in the form of
building hospitals or old age homes. Most of the Holocaust
survivors living in eastern Europe have never been individually
compensated by Bonn as those in the West.
</P>
<P>
Germany says it has paid out some 100 billion marks (55 billion
dollars) since World War II in compensation for crimes committed
during the Nazi rule from 1933 to 1945.

<HEADLINE> Siemens, Motorola Team UP in Chip Venture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Germany's electronics giant
Siemens AG and its U.S. partner Motorola Inc. announced Monday a
joint venture agreement to develop a new computer chip-making
technology at the eastern German city of Dresden.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture is aimed at developing new technology to
produce computer chips on 300-millimeter wafer boards, wider than
the current industry standard of 200 millimeters.
</P>
<P>
Moving to larger wafers will allow the companies to produce
roughly 2.5 times more chips per wafer and to cut production costs
by about 30 percent, said Siemens chief executive Heinrich von
Pierer at a news conference in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the Siemens-Motorola joint venture, which
would be the biggest microelectronics project ever started in
Europe, is expected to cost 1.5 billion marks (890 million
U.S. dollars), with the research and development costs alone
expected to exceed 1 billion marks (595 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The German government will also provide about 250 million marks
(150 million dollars) in state subsidies to support the project.

BANGKOK, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government Monday
decided to issue bonds from February 1 to raise money, in
particular foreign currencies at home and abroad, according to
local media reports.
</P>
<P>
The government bonds will be issued by the Government Savings
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government hopes to raise 500 million US dollars
through the bond issue.
</P>
<P>
At home, the Thai people will be encouraged to swap gold and
foreign currencies for bonds.

Last week the government adopted a number of measures to
tighten the control of foreign currency. The central bank will
monitor each foreign currency transaction by commercial banks, and
individuals buying foreign currency must provide air tickets or
visa.
</P>
<P>
Companies buying foreign currencies need to show necessary
documents, such as export bills.
</P>

Meanwhile, the Thai baht Monday sank to 56.40/56.60 per dollar

OTTAWA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The crippling ice storm that
swept central Canada may hurt the country's insurers harder than
last year's Winnipeg flood.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary estimates of damages from the storm in the Montreal
area alone have been placed at 500 million dollars (350 million

</P>
<P>
Damages in the national capital region and surrounding areas

The Winnipeg flood may have caused more overall damages, but
they didn't hit insurers hard since flooding isn't covered in most
policies.

The latest ice storm will probably prompt a higher number of

<HEADLINE> Turkey Denies Human Rights Reason for Illegal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today reiterated that
the illegal Kurdish immigrants went to Europe not because of
fearing political prosecution, but due to economic reasons.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a weekly news briefing here, Turkish Foreign
Ministry spokesman Necati Utkan said that the Kurds who headed for
 Italy and other European nations were in pursuit of a better life
in rich Western countries.
</P>
<P>
It is groundless to hold that these illegal immigrants were
fleeing political prosecution, Utkan said.
</P>
<P>
Large numbers of illegal immigrants entered Italy by sea over
the past weeks, and some of them apparently tried to go to
Germany and other European countries from there.
</P>
<P>
Recent Western press reports said that the illegal immigrants,
mostly Kurds from Turkey and northern Iraq, rushed to Europe
since they feared they might suffer prosecution.
</P>
<P>
"It is a general tendency that people living in low-income
countries wish to go to rich Western countries," Utkan said,
adding that this kind of immigration is not a peculiar phenomenon
of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party
(PKK), which has been fighting the Turkish government for
autonomy since 1984, also played a part in the illegal immigration
flood.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that other underground organizations,
including mafia, were also involved in this exodus.
</P>
<P>
Germany, Austria and other European countries had expressed
their grave concern over the issue, demanding that Turkey adopt
effective measures to halt this immigration flood.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they also called on Italy to take cautious steps in
dealing with these illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government was reportedly examining these illegal
immigrants and would granted some of them political asylum if
they were proved political refugees.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Interior Ministry is now organizing a nation-wide
police operation aimed at stopping this illegal
immigration. Hundreds of people have been arrested in Istanbul,
the largest city of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Utkan said that some foreigners were also found among the
illegal immigrants trying to enter Europe, mostly from Sri Lanka,
Egypt, Iraq as well as Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
As a country linking Europe and Asia, Turkey has always served
as a springboard for illegal immigration from some poor Asian
countries to Europe.

<HEADLINE> Study of Society's Rising Madness Urged in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 12 (Xinhua) -- A high court judge today said
social scientists should find out the cause for society's growing
lack of respect for the rule of law resulting in the high crime
rate.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening the first session of the 1998 Bulawayo (the
country's second largest city) high court session, Justice
Misheck Cheda said he was particularly concerned at the high
murder and divorce rates in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"People are hitting each other with all sorts of dangerous
weapons at the slightest provocation, clearly indicating an
intention to kill and loss of respect for human life," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said social scientists should find out what had gone wrong
with the society.
</P>
<P>
Cheda said Zimbabwe's prisons were full, adding even if the
country built more courts and prisons, these would soon fill up.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he said while the high court used to grant
between two and three divorces every week, this had now shot up
to 12 cases.
</P>
<P>
"The institution of marriage is gradually losing its impact
and respect. The courts have no answers to all these murder and
social problems and it is for the community and the nation to put
heads together and resolve them," he said.
</P>
<P>
The high court judge also commended the formation of the
neighborhood watch committees which had helped in reducing crime,
but however warned against the excessive use of force and what is
commonly known as "mob justice".
</P>
<P>
He urged the police to provide some form of training and
guidance for people, or leaders in the neighborhood committees,
especially those in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
He also challenged legal practitioners to have a high standard
of integrity and honesty, noting that many law firms which have
mushroomed in recent years, have faced trouble and disaster due
to lack of appropriate experience.

<HEADLINE> 2 Million Canadians Still Without Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- More than 2 million people in
central Canada are still without power as the ice storm crisis
enters its second week.
</P>
<P>
And at least half of those people will remain in the dark and
cold for a week or more, said reports today.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard made a public plea
for citizens to take storm victims into their homes.
</P>
<P>
At least 15 people have died as a result of a storm that
brought nearly 10 centimeters of freezing by Saturday. The ice
crushed trees and hydroelectric towers.
</P>
<P>
Many schools and public institutions remain closed here in
Ottawa and Montreal, and private companies are being urged to keep
workers off the roads.
</P>
<P>
Civil-security officials were pleading with residents without
power to head for shelters, where they can have access to warm
food and shelter.
</P>
<P>
Electrical workers are stepping up their efforts to restore
electricity to the hard-hit customers.
</P>
<P>
More than 11,400 Canadian soldiers were reported to be working
on the clean, largely around Montreal and Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
This is the largest ever peacetime deployment for Canadian
Forces.

<HEADLINE> 35,000 Zimbabwean Villagers Starving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 12 (Xinhua) -- More than 35,000 people in Omay
communal lands in Kariba, north Zimbabwe are starving and
urgently need special food relief aid from the government because
of floods, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Kariba member of parliament Shumbayaonda Chandengenda today
said he had approached the Ministry of Public Service, Labor and
Social Welfare on the need for a special relief program for the
people.
</P>
<P>
He said he had registered the application following a
resolution at a Nyaminyami rural district council meeting on the
plight of the families whose crops had either been destroyed by
wildlife or washed away by floods.
</P>
<P>
"The food that was reserved from last year has been exhausted
and people are now being forced to move to Gokwe or Hurungwe in
search of food so we are appealing to the government to move on
this one with speed and also non-governmental organizations are
welcome to help," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last year people in the area lost the majority of their
domestic animals to lions with other villagers losing their
homesteads to fire.
</P>
<P>
Omay falls under natural region 5 which is unsuitable for
farming but tourism as the area is common with wild animals such
as elephants, lions and buffalo.
</P>
<P>
Chandengenda said he, together with other government and
ruling ZANU (PF) officials, will embark on a week long tour of
Omay and surrounding areas to assess and discuss the food problem
facing people in the constituency.

<HEADLINE> Holiday Road Death Toll Reduced in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The death toll on South
African roads during the holiday season since December 1 to date
was 883, 29 percent lower than in the same period last year, the
"Arrive Alive" traffic safety campaign said today.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,242 people died between December 3 and January 12
last year.
</P>
<P>
Of the 883 deaths in 625 accidents this year, 390 were
passengers, 282 pedestrians and 211 drivers.
</P>
<P>
Kwazulu-Natal, where seaside resort Durban is located, had
more road deaths than any other provinces with 158, followed by
Gauteng and Eastern Cape with 144 each.
</P>
<P>
The least number of deaths were reported in Northern Cape with
41.
</P>
<P>
Speeding by motorists was still the number one killer on South
African roads, but passengers and pedestrians also shared their
responsibility by not wearing seatbelts and jaywalking, according
to the road safety campaign.

<HEADLINE> EU Grants 140 Mln ECUs to Ensure Reliable Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission has
decided to grant 140 million ECUs (155 million U.S. dollars) to
134 energy technology projects.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced today with an aim of ensuring
reliable and sustainable energy supplies at affordable cost and
protecting the environment.
</P>
<P>
The technology projects are in the fields of rational use of
energy, fossil fuels and renewable energy sources.
</P>
<P>
The EU grant will also finance 75 accompanying measures that
include demonstration of commercial-scale energy technology
projects, promotion and dissemination of information and project
results.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration projects are expected to provide immediate
and short-term support for important policy concerns such as
reduction of environmental hazards like carbon dioxide emissions.
</P>
<P>
The projects on rational use of energy are aimed at further
reducing investment costs while those on fossil fuels, which
represent 21 percent of the gross energy consumption of the
15-nation European Union, are aimed at overcoming the inherent
environmental problems and reducing the cost associated with its
production and use.
</P>
<P>
The renewable energy sources are mainly focused on biomass and
wind.
</P>
<P>
The EU grant will come from its funding program of Thermie that
draws 566 million ECUs (627 million dollars) from a larger funding
pool known as Joule-Thermie.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's ANC Denies Reports of Merger Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 12 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's ruling
African National Congress (ANC) today denied media reports that
it was discussing a merger with the largest black opposition, the
Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP).
</P>
<P>
"The recent flurry of reports about the possible merger
between the ANC and the IFP are completely unfounded and without
any substantiation" the ANC said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Independent newspaper said that the ANC has swung
into action to strike a deal with the IFP to form a coalition
government in Kwazulu-Natal soon and to merge the two parties in
the longer term.
</P>
<P>
It quoted ANC insiders as saying that a merger or coalition
proposal had been circulated at a special provincial working
committee meeting of the ANC in Kwazulu-Natal, the sole province
governed by the IFP.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the proposal suggested that either the IFP be
dissolved or share a single election list with the ANC. The
report also said that ANC leaders, including former President
Nelson Mandela, new President Thabo Mbeki and Deputy President
Jacob Zuma, were propelling the merger.
</P>
<P>
The ANC denied that there were discussion on this issue.
</P>
<P>
"There has been no discussion between the ANC and IFP
leadership on the question of a merger between the two
organizations," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"For its part, the leadership of the ANC has never discussed
the matter. Interactions between the national leadership of the
ANC and the IFP have been limited to the creation of a climate
for peace and stability in the province of Kwazulu-Natal."
</P>
<P>
Mandela called for a merger between the two long-time rivals
on the eve of the ANC's 50th national conference held in
mid-December. He said in capacity as ANC president that his party
would welcome a merger with the IFP as a "progressive
development" because South Africa needed to speak with one voice.
</P>
<P>
The two parties were locked in a bitter struggle for influence
in the 1980s and early 1990s, which resulted in more than 20,000
deaths.
</P>
<P>
The idea of ANC-IFP merger caused jitters among white-based
opposition parties such as the National Party and the Democratic
Party, which feared that a merger could give the already powerful
ANC too much power.
</P>
<P>
The topic has ever since then become sensitive to both the ANC
and the IFP.

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Suspend Arms Inspection Team's Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has decided to stop any
arms inspections by the new U.N. team headed by an American, Scott
Ritter, which arrived here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In an announcement made by an official spokesman to the Iraq
News Agency, Iraq said it will block the U.N. team's inspection
starting Tuesday until it is recomposed through a balanced
participation by permanent members of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi move is again setting the country in a collision
course with the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in
charge of overseeing the elimination of Baghdad's weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has accused Ritter, an American officer, as a spy, and
criticized the team, with nine Americans, five Britons, a Russian
and an Australian, as not balanced in composition.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Iraq has raised the problem of lack of
balance in the make-up of UNSCOM, and stressed American and
British domination in the body is behind prolonging sanctions
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He accused the Americans with UNSCOM of "falsifying facts,
inventing lies, deliberately prolonging the inspection process and
sending false reports to the Security Council" about what Iraq has
met in terms of Resolution 687 requirements.
</P>
<P>
He said the continuation of this situation is unacceptable, and
Iraq was hoping that a reasonable balance would be effected in
UNSCOM composition and its procedure in Iraq after last crisis
over arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad ordered the expulsion of the American inspectors on
November 13 in its last standoff with UNSCOM. The Americans were
allowed to return, together with their colleagues who then pulled
out to protest the eviction, only after Russian mediation a week
later.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman said, those who dominate UNSCOM
headquarters in New York insist on their former position and their
biased policy.
</P>
<P>
He said that sending the team in this way underlines their
insistence and lack of respect for the demands of other states,
especially permanent members of the Security Council, to increase
their participation in UNSCOM's activities.

<HEADLINE> Prince Philip Calls for Change in Use of Oceans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Prince Philip today
called for a sea change in the way the human use the marine
environment.
</P>
<P>
"There is overwhelming evidence that, not just the fish stocks,
but the vast bulks of the renewable resources of the oceans are
over-exploited," he said at a news conference marking the
beginning of the International Year of the Ocean.
</P>
<P>
The event, organized by the World Wide Fund For Nature (WWF),
of which Prince Philip is president-emeritus, highlighted some
growing threats facing the world's marine environment.
</P>
<P>
According to United Nations figures cited by the WWF, at least
60 percent of the world's 200 most commercially valuable fish
species are either overfished or fished to the limit.
</P>
<P>
Overfishing and destructive fishing practices have pushed
numbers of many valuable species to all-time lows.
</P>
<P>
The massive pollution of the oceans by toxic effluents and the
dumping of waste, largely caused by the increase in industrial
activities, is one of the factors that contribute to the decline
of fish stocks, the prince said.
</P>
<P>
The WWF has proposed, the prince said, that governments and the
fishing industry should ratify and adhere to international
fisheries agreements.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the WWF called for more responsible fisheries
management and the creation of an effective global network of
marine parks and reserves to safeguard critical ocean habitats.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has designated 1998 as the International
Year of the Ocean in recognition of the importance of the ocean
and the marine environment.
</P>
<P>
This, the prince said, "presents a wonderful opportunity to
initiate a campaign to ensure that there will be a reasonable
stock of fish for future fishermen and a reasonable supply of fish
for future consumers."

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Urges Global Support for Children's Vaccine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) chief Carol Bellamy called here today for global support
for the Children's Vaccine Initiative (CVI), saying that millions
of young children can be saved from needless death each year if
new vaccines are widely used in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
According to a new report released by the CVI, the development
of new vaccines for diseases such as rotavirus diarrhea and
pneumococcal pneumonia in infants and the widespread deployment of
under-used vaccines for diseases like measles can save up to 12
million lives a year, mostly from infections in childhood.
</P>
<P>
"But these children's lives won't be saved without prompt
action to increase the worldwide rate of child immunization," said
Bellamy.
</P>
<P>
She noted that over 80 percent of young children are immunized
against the six major killer diseases today, compared to less than
5 percent in 1979.
</P>
<P>
"This means about 3 million fewer children die each year than
before, and it is a major public health achievement," she said.
"However, since 1990 the percentage of children vaccinated has not
increased significantly, and no new vaccines have been introduced
on a large scale in developing countries."
</P>
<P>
The CVI is co-sponsored by the UNICEF, the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP), the World Health Organization (WHO),
the World Bank and the Rockefeller Foundation.
</P>
<P>
"Vaccination is our most powerful weapon in the war against
infectious diseases," said J.W. Lee, executive secretary of the
CVI. "We must use it to fully protect all of the world's
children."
</P>
<P>
The CVI's strategic plan sets the following goals:
</P>
<P>
-- Control global incidence of measles, hepatitis B, Hib (which
causes meningitis and pneumonia) and rubella through broader
implementation in all regions no later than 2005;
</P>
<P>
-- Develop and introduce new, better vaccines that will reduce
deaths due to infectious diseases, and which are capable of
preventing more diseases;
</P>
<P>
-- Develop vaccines and vaccination techniques that simplify
immunization programs through such means as oral, nasal or other
forms of delivery, or reducing the number of injections.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Survives No-Confidence Votes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu survived this evening two no-confidence motions
in the Knesset (parliament) introduced by the opposition Labor and
Meretz parties.
</P>
<P>
The two motions were voted against by 54 Knesset members of
the ruling coalition and for by 54 others from the opposition
parties.
</P>
<P>
According to Israeli law, a no-confidence motion to topple the
prime minister needs support of 61 Knesset members in the
120-seat Knesset.
</P>
<P>
All five Knesset members of the Gesher Party led by former
Foreign Minister David levy, who resigned on January 4, voted for
the motions. This meant the Gesher faction has totally broken away
from the ruling Likud Group.
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon, Knesset Speaker Dan Tichon held a meeting
with Levy and asked him and his Gesher members not to vote for
the motions, otherwise, the government will not implement the fund
allocation agreement reached before with the Gesher Party.
</P>
<P>
Earlier during the debate, the opposition Knesset members took
turns to criticize Netanyahu, saying that his economic policy only
cares for the rich, not the poor people.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Defense Minister Silvan Shalon defended Netanyahu on
behalf of the coalition partners, saying the new state budget
approved by the Knesset last week is a balanced one.

<HEADLINE> URGENT: Nepali King Still Holding Consultations Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 12 (Xinhua) -- King Birendra was still
undecided Monday whether to dissolve parliament and hold mid-term
polls or convene a special parliamentary session to discuss an
opposition no-confidence motion against the government, the King's
Principal Press Secretariat said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a Royal Palace source said the King had decided to
accept the petition by Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa to
dissolve parliament and hold mid-term elections.
</P>
<P>
But the same source later said that the King, who, according to
a notice from the Press Secretariat in the evening, on Monday
continued the course of consultations with parliamentary leaders,
party leaders and legal experts over the political situation in
the country, may also consult with the Supreme Court on Tuesday
before he could make a final decision.
</P>
<P>
The political situation has become uncertain after Thapa last
Thursday requested the dissolution of parliament and hold mid-term
polls, while the main opposition Communist Party of Nepal (United
Marxism Leninism, CPN-UML) asked the King to convene a special
session of parliament to discuss their no-confidence motion
against the government.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have claimed that their petitions are
constitutional.
</P>
<P>
In August 1995, the Supreme Court overturned a recommendation
by then Prime Minister Man Mohan Adhikari of the CPN-UML to
dissolve parliament and hold mid-term polls, and reinstated the
dissolved parliament.
</P>
<P>
The court ruled that dissolution was not allowed if an
alternative government could be formed from the existing
parliament.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Court Orders Extended Remand of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Tel Aviv Magistrates
Court Monday ordered the extended remand until the end of trial of
a German agent sent by Hezbollah (Party of God) to launch suicide
attack.
</P>
<P>
Stefan Josef Smirak, aged 26 and a convert to Islam, was
arrested on November 28 upon his arrival at the Ben-Gurion
Airport. He was put on trial on December 25 with charges of
spying, attempting to carry out terror attack and being a member
of a terror organization.
</P>
<P>
Legal experts said each of the three charges carries a maximal
sentence of life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Smirak was allegedly recruited by the pro-Iranian Hezbollah,
which has been waging a guerrilla war against Israeli occupation
of South Lebanon, during a visit to Lebanon between August and
November last year.
</P>
<P>
During the period, Smirak was sent to a training camp in the
Bekka Valley in Lebanon, where he was taught to use light weapons
and operate explosive devices.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police said Smirak was provided with video cameras and
electronic communication devices, and sent to Israel to collect
information and film densely populated areas in order to target a
site for the attack.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah handlers in Lebanon also demanded Smirak change his
passport in order to erase any traces of his Lebanese visit
before travelling to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Once he finished the fact-finding mission, Smirak planned to
fly to Turkey and contact his handlers to finalize the plan for
carrying out the suicide attack, police added.
</P>
<P>
No details about how he was found out and picked up by the
police were revealed.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Sets Aside Areas for Oil, Gas Prospection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The General Petroleum Authority
of Egypt Monday invited international tenders to take part in oil
prospection in areas of 170,188 square kilometers, the Middle East
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Egyptian, Arab and foreign investors will be given the chance
to receive a concession in one or more areas individually or
jointly," Egyptian Minister of Petroleum Hamdi Ali Abdel Wahab
Al-Banbi said at a press conference held here.
</P>
<P>
The deadline for international bids will end on April 20 this
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister disclosed the new prospection will be carried out
in nine areas, including those in the coastal waters of the
Mediterranean, the Western Desert, the Gulf of Suez and the South
of the Nile Valley.
</P>
<P>
He said the General Petroleum Authority received 29 bids for
prospecting oil and natural gas from international companies,
which had reflected their confidence in the climate of investment
and political and economic stability in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The oil and gas industry, one of the four largest foreign
currency earners in Egypt, produces 50 percent of the country's
total exports.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil and gas output reached 44.1 million tonnes and 9.9
million tonnes respectively in the 1995-96 fiscal year, according
to a report by the General Petroleum Authority.

<HEADLINE> Eastern Europe Economic Growth Forecast to Accelerate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The general domestic product
(GDP) in eastern European countries will this year accelerate at
their fastest rate since these countries began their economic
transition, according to a report published today.
</P>
<P>
The report World Outlook 1998, a forecast of global political
and economic trends by the Economic Intelligence Unit (EIU), said
that the eastern European economies will grow by 4.1 percent in
1998 compared with 2.3 percent last year and only 0.1 percent in
1996.
</P>
<P>
The report said that among the top 20 growth rates forecast for
1998, six are provided by former Eastern bloc countries, with
Bosnia at the top of the league and its output forecast to expand
by 35 percent, followed by Albania (12 percent) and Georgia (10
percent).
</P>
<P>
Although Asia provides three of the 20 slowest growing
countries in the world, with Thailand, Japan and South Korea all
suffering from the region's financial crisis, the EIU expects
China, Burma, and Vietnam to enjoy annual growth of 6 percent or
higher.
</P>
<P>
The report expected the economy of the former Soviet republic
of Turkmenistan to shrink by 2 percent to become the worst
performing economy in the world.
</P>
<P>
It also predicted that world growth will slow down to 2.7
percent during 1998 from 3.1 percent in 1996 and 1997 and this
will bring lower inflation, 4.3 percent this year, 0.8 percent
down over 1997.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Condemns Plan on Human Cloning in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today condemned a plan announced by a U.S. doctor to conduct
human cloning.
</P>
<P>
Chirac made the condemnation at the opening ceremony here of a
special session of the European Council dedicated to extending the
European Convention on Human Rights to banning human cloning.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen out of 40 European Council countries are attending
the session which will end Tuesday, and a protocol on banning
human cloning is expected to be signed by France and some other
European countries.
</P>
<P>
Besides France, Chirac called for the adoption by all world
countries of the European initiative to legally ban human cloning
on an international basis.
</P>
<P>
"We will solve nothing by banning certain practices in one
country if the researchers and doctors can do it somewhere else,"
said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
"This is why we should stop the worrying deviations such as
that which has been published planned in the United States," he
said.
</P>
<P>
A doctor named Richard Seed announced that he would open a
clinic in Chicago to clone human beings to help the sterile people
have children.
</P>
<P>
Chirac was the first foreign head of state to openly condemn
the announcement by Seed.
</P>
<P>
United States President Bill Clinton has also denounced the
plan, and has asked the U.S. Congress to pass a bill on banning
human cloning as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
The European protocol on banning human cloning is open for
signing by the 40 member countries of the European Union as well
as the United States, Australia, Canada, Japan, and the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
But Germany, which has already drawn a lesson from its Nazi
past, said it will not sign the protocol, because its domestic law
on banning human experiments is strong enough and covers the
content of the protocol.
</P>
<P>
Britain, where the first mammal sheep clone was made last year,
will not sign the protocol either.

<HEADLINE> UNFICYP Calls for Clearing Minefields in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Peace-Keeping Force
in Cyprus (UNFICYP) today appealed to Greek and Turkish Cypriot
sides of the divided island to cooperate with it to clear
minefields and booby traps in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. made the appeal following an accident in which a
U.N. vehicle hit a mine in the buffer zone around mid-day. No one
was injured but the vehicle was damaged.
</P>
<P>
UNFICYP spokesman Waldemar Rokoszewski told reporters the
accident occurred when two Argentine non-commissioned officers
working on the Lefka road, in the buffer zone north-west of the
capital Nicosia, drove over a mine within one meter off the road
in an unmarked area.
</P>
<P>
Rokoszewski stressed this incident once more proved there is an
urgent need to clear minefields and booby traps in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He emphasised that military cooperation of both Cypriot sides,
as requested by UNFICYP, is necessary to conduct this kind of
operation.
</P>
<P>
Rokoszewski said it is not the first time a U.N. vehicle hit a
mine. According to U.N. reports, there are 39 minefields and
booby-trapped areas inside the 180-kilometer-long buffer zone,
which is patrolled by UNFICYP.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that over 16,000 landmines have been laid in
these areas since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded and took over
the northern third of the island in the wake of a failed
pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Peace Talks Resume With New Impetus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The all-party peace talks on the
future of Northern Ireland resumed today at Stormont near Belfast
after a three-week Christmas recess.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from all the main pro-British Unionist and Republican
parties attended the first session of talks, local reports said.
</P>
<P>
To add new impetus to the fragile peace talks, the British and
Irish governments agreed today on joint proposals for a political
settlement to the decades-old Northern Ireland conflict.
</P>
<P>
The plan envisages a power-sharing assembly which would
coordinate cross-border cooperation with the Irish government. It
was aimed at easing tension between majority Protestants and
minority Catholics over the future of British sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, on a visit to Tokyo, made a
flurry of phone calls to key participants over the weekend in a
bid to nail down the text of a plan to kick-start the slow-moving
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Tension was high after Christmas with four murders by rival
militias who oppose the peace process, casting a shadow on the
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
British Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam managed to
persuade loyalist guerrilla inmates in the Maze prison last Friday
to renew their backing for the peace process, thus making today's
resumption of talks possible.

<HEADLINE> World Oil Price Faces Another Uncertain Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The prospect of world oil price
will be still uncertain during this week following the recent oil
price decline, the Financial Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that one of the causes leading to the
uncertainty is that 1998 may turn out to be a year in which world
oil production outstrips demand.
</P>
<P>
Another bearish factor is that the economic and currency
turmoil in some Asian countries may not only make Asian energy
demand plummet but could also hit GDP and energy demand growth in
North America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the prospect of greater OPEC output, together with
the expected resumption this week of Iraqi exports, also added to
the gloom.
</P>
<P>
The mild temperatures so far this year in many parts of North
America and Europe are not offering any support for oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Another reason is the forecast higher level of non-OPEC output
this year. It was reported that last year there were numerous
delays to new fields in non-OPEC countries, but this will not be
repeated this year.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Do Utmost to Repair Road Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The newly appointed Minister
for Public Works, Kipkalya Kones, said today that his government
was doing everything possible to repair the road network which
had been severely damaged by heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during the handing-over ceremony by former Minister
Jonathan Ngeno, he pointed out that his ministry was greatly
concerned with the state of the road network in the country,
which has been worsened by the El Nino weather phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that it is important to improve the
infrastructure if the government is to improve economic
development and win investors' confidence in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government is scheduled to airlift relief supplies
to Kilifi District, Coast Province, where floods swept bridges
and destroyed roads, the Kenya News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted District Officer Lucas Kosilbet as saying
today that the government's previous efforts to repair roads and
bridges had come to naught after heavy rains persisted in the
district.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the operation would target more than 60,000
people in the areas of the district which had not been accessible
for the last four months.
</P>
<P>
The agency also reported that hotels and lodges in the world
famous Masai Mara National Reserve may be forced to close down
their business if the current heavy rains continue pounding the
area.
</P>
<P>
Lorries and trucks transporting foodstuff, beverages and fuel
have been stuck along the muddy Narok-Masai Mara road for several
days while efforts to mobilize heavy duty tractors to tow them
out have been fruitless.
</P>
<P>
The hotels and lodges are experiencing problems in organizing
game drives as the reserve is water-logged, the report added.

<HEADLINE> 9 Nuns Slaughtered by Militiamen in Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Nine sisters, six Rwandans and
three Congolese were killed in Rwanda on Thursday night, reported
Rwanda News Agency today.
</P>
<P>
The murder that is blamed on armed Hutu militiamen took place
at Busasamana Parish, in Rwerere commune, northeast of Gisenyi
town, on the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC),
the report said.
</P>
<P>
"The militiamen armed with guns and traditional weapons
encircled the residences before killing them," well-informed
sources in Gisenyi told Rwanda News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"The nuns were found dead when people intervened to help
them," the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The criminals reportedly used guns and machetes to kill the
nuns who are said to belong to the "Filles de la Resurrection"
order.
</P>
<P>
However, the Catholic Episcopal Conference in Kigali said five
nuns were killed at Busasamana. The five were buried at Nyundo,
near Gisenyi today, the conference indicated.
</P>
<P>
It has not been possible to confirm the exact number of nuns
who were murdered at Busasamana.
</P>
<P>
Two other clergy people, a Belgian nun and a Canadian priest,
were killed in north-western Rwanda last year in attacks blamed
on Hutu extremists.

<HEADLINE> US: Iraq Has No Right to "Pick and Choose" Inspectors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has no right to
determine who should carry out weapons inspections, a Clinton
administration official said today.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq cannot pick and choose who inspects its WMD (weapons of
mass destruction) programs," said the official of the National
Security Council. "This is a U.N. decision."
</P>
<P>
His statement was responding to Iraq's announcement, which said
through the Iraqi official news agency INA, "Iraq has decided to
halt the work of the inspection team headed by American Scott
Ritter ad has withdrawn permission for him to undertake any
activities inside its territory starting from Tuesday until the
composition of the team has balanced participation from the
permanent members of the Security Council."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has previously accused Ritter of spying for the United
States. But Ritter, who leads one of several weapons inspection
teams, dismissed Iraq's accusation as "absolutely untrue."
</P>
<P>
The official of the National Security Council said that if the
reports about Iraq's decision were true, it would be "a clear
violation of the Security Council's demand that Iraq give (the
U.N. inspectors) full and unfettered access to all sites."
</P>
<P>
"We would expect the Security Council to very quickly review
this very latest Iraqi outrage and make clear that Iraq must
reverse its position," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last November, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein ordered American
inspectors to leave the country on the grounds of spying for the
United States, which led to complete withdrawal of weapons
inspectors and to a weapons inspection crisis bringing the two
countries on the verge of military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
The crisis was resolved after Saddam, convinced by Russia's
mediation, agreed to allow the inspectors to go back and resume
their work.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Judicial Officials Called to Respect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 12 (Xinhua) - Head of the Iranian Judiciary
Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi Monday issued a decree calling on the
country's judicial officials to respect the constitution in
judicial affairs.
</P>
<P>
According the state television, Yazdi said all the judicial
officials should "exactly and accurately" carry out Article 37
and 39 of the constitution.
</P>
<P>
According to the articles, he said, no one is guilty of a
charge unless his or her guilt has been established by a competent
court.
</P>
<P>
Yazdi stressed that in order to protect the dignity and repute
of the accused, judicial officials should not reveal name or any
identity of the accused before a court ruled a verdict on him or
her.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that Yazdi was forced to issue the decree under
heavy pressure from supporters of Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami who intended to bring the country under the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
Many senior Iranian officials and newspapers have warned the
country's judiciary bodies to avoid "any illegal measures"
against any person, particularly illegal arrest of members of
rival political factions.
</P>
<P>
Last month, both President Khatami and Interior Minister
Abdollah Nouri stressed that the exercise of authority should be
within the framework of the country's laws and no one has the
right to impose his opinion on others.
</P>
<P>
No freedom is possible unless it is within the norms of law
and any practice of freedom outside the limits and framework of
law either breeds a state of anarchy or foments dictatorship in a
society, Khatami said.

JOHANNESBURG, January 12 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad and his Russian counterpart, Viktor
Posuvalyuk, met today in Pretoria to discuss South African
President Nelson Mandela's upcoming visit to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Posuvalyuk said a date of the state visit will soon be
announced in Moscow, according to South African Press Association
(SAPA).
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted Pahad as saying that the two men also discussed
several other issues, such as the situation in the Middle East,
reform of the United Nations and the forthcoming Non-Aligned
Movement summit to be held in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Support from Moscow is crucial for South Africa in its bid for
a permanent seat on an enlarged United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Both men said there was a potential in the development of
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the possibility of an arms deal between the two
countries, Posuvalyuk said the issue was not on the cards.
</P>
<P>
There were reports in South Africa that Moscow had been
excluded from a shortlist of producers and suppliers of military
equipment to South Africa worth 10 billion Rand (2.04 billion
U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The reason, the reports said, was because Moscow's
counter-trade offer failed to meet the minimum requirements.

<HEADLINE> Ex-ECOMOG Chief Optimistic About S. Leone Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The redoubled efforts of the
west African peacekeeping force (ECOMOG) will ensure an end of
the peace process in Sierra Leone "in record time", the former
ECOMOG chief has said.
</P>
<P>
"There are 5,000 ECOMOG troops already in Sierra Leone and
once they are joined by the 10,000 soldiers from Monrovia,
disarmament of all factions in Sierra Leone and other assignments
will be completed without delay," said Maj.-gen. Victor Malu.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the April 22 deadline would be met for the
restoration of ousted president Ahmed Tejan Kabbah in Sierra
Leone, the News Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
The infantry general, who was until last week the ECOMOG force
commander, returned here at the weekend from the Liberian
capital.
</P>
<P>
The force, sent to Liberia eight years ago, has helped restore
peace and provide security to the country's post-war election
under a peace plan of the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
It now has the mandate to restore to power by April 22 the
government of Kabbah who was toppled on May 25 last year in a
coup led by Major Johnny Paul Koroma.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Koroma said that the ruling military junta would
be unlikely to hand over as scheduled due to the delay in
disarmament and delivery of international relief goods.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, heavy fightings have been reported between the
junta forces and the pro-Kabbah Kamajor militias in the southeast
of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Despite all these, Malu said the April 22 deadline was
attainable.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that ECOMOG will have to re-double its efforts.
But I can assure you that once the order is given by the ECOWAS
leaders, the troops will move in and the job will be accomplished
in record time," he said.
</P>
<P>
Malu's words coincided with those of the United Nations
special envoy to Sierra Leone, Francis Okello.
</P>
<P>
Okello reassured at the weekend that the terminal date could
be struck to in spite of the fact that disarmament has not
commenced.
</P>
<P>
According to Okello, a UN observer mission team to supervise
the peace process along with the west African peacekeeping force
known as ECOMOG was getting prepared to move in the troubled west
African country.
</P>
<P>
The team would monitor development in Sierra Leone and to work
closely with ECOWAS and ECOMOG, and to be in contact with the
regime in Freetown, he said.

the planned January 1999 introduction of the single European
currency, the Euro, four German professors today launched a legal
complaint at the German constitutional court calling for a delay
in the Euro launch.
</P>
<P>
The complaint filed by four German professors of economics and
law, including a former member of Germany's central bank council,
Wilhelm Noelling, deals mainly with Europe's adherence to the
Maastricht Treaty criteria on Euro membership and the conditions
laid down by the German constitutional court in 1993 on the
treaty's legality.
</P>
<P>
In its 1993 decision, the German constitutional court held that
the Maastricht criteria, meant to ensure the Euro's stability,
must be strictly adhered to and that fulfillment of the criteria
must have priority over the Euro's 1999 start date.
</P>
<P>
However, the professors noted that there is obviously
widespread failure among the possible Euro candidate countries,
Germany included, to fulfill the Maastricht criteria to bring the
budget deficit to no more than 3 percent, and the national debt to
no more than 60 percent of the gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the stability of the Euro is not guaranteed and it
is still premature to introduce the single currency in 1999, the
professors said.
</P>
<P>
They also argued that a premature launch of the Euro would also
violate the constitutionally guaranteed property rights.
</P>
<P>
The legal challenge to the Euro launched today came amid
general reluctance among the German population to give up their
rock-hard German mark, which has been so successful to safeguard
the country's prosperity in the post-war era, in exchange for a
common European currency whose future is still uncertain.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, German politicians from Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
ruling coalition as well as from the opposition parties have
largely come to the consensus that the Euro must come punctually
on January 1, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Renewed Communal Clash Displaces 50,000 in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- More than 50,000 persons were
displaced and property worth millions of Naira destroyed during
renewed communal clash in east Nigeria's Taraba State.
</P>
<P>
The latest incident between Jukun/Chamba and Kuteps tribes was
rated as the worst since the protracted crisis began three months
ago as many house were razed, rendering thousands of people
homeless, the News Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
One person has been confirmed to be killed in the conflict,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Local officials have complained that the two parties involved
were culpable for burning down houses and destroying property.
</P>
<P>
A series of meetings have been held between elders of the
warring factions to find a lasting solution to the problem, but
the elite among them who resided outside the state continued to
foment trouble, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The conflict began in October last year when Takum and Ussa
local government councils were dissolved and sole administers
were appointed to run them.
</P>
<P>
The Kuteps had been protesting against the creation of Ussa
local government out of Takum, as well as the movement of their
settlements to Ussa, leaving only Jukum/Chamba in Takum local
government which the Kuteps consider as their ancestral home.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Not to Inaugurate Air Base Before Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus said Monday that the air
force base near the western coastal town of Paphos will not be
inaugurated before the presidential elections due to be held
on February 8.
</P>
<P>
At the daily press briefing, the government spokesman Manolis
Christofides confirmed the announcement of Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides last week that the air base will be completed and
handed over to the Cypriot government on January 24.
</P>
<P>
But he said that it will not be put into operation before the
election.
</P>
<P>
The air base is constructed under a defense pact Cyprus reached
with Greece in 1993. Under the pact, Greece will provide Cyprus
with military assistance in case the Mediterranean island is
attacked.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the air base will enable Cyprus "to
tackle Turkish provocations within the framework of the joint
defense pact."
</P>
<P>
But the announcement of opening the air base has triggered
strong reactions from the Turkish Cypriots, whose leader Rauf
Denktash has warned that the Turkish Cypriots will take immediate
steps if the Cypriot government does not back down.
</P>
<P>
"Necessary steps will be taken along with Turkey in response to
the Greek Cypriot administration's joint move with Greece,"
Denktash said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island to protect
the Turkish Cypriot minorities after a failed coup by the Greek
Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government spokesman, however, said that "Turkey
should be the last to have the right of reacting to the Republic's
efforts to bolster its defense, as our aim is to protect the
Republic from a new Turkish attack."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Greece as a guarantor of the independence of
Cyprus "has every right to take all necessary measures to fulfill
its obligations toward the Republic."
</P>
<P>
Greece, Britain and Turkey have been the guarantors of the
independence of Cyprus since it won independence from British
colonial rule in 1960.

LUSAKA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Four more senior officials of
the United National Independence Party (UNIP) led by former
president Kenneth Kaunda were picked up last week, UNIP Secretary

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Chief: 8 Mln Young Children Can Be Saved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Eight million young
children can escape needless death each year if a group of new
vaccines are widely used in developing nations, the Children's
Vaccine Initiative (CVI) said in a new report released here today.
</P>
<P>
The CVI is an international effort to develop and introduce new
vaccines to address diseases of public health importance. It is
the result of a unique partnership among the United Nations
Children's Found (UNICEF), the United Nations Development Program,
the World Health Organization and the Rockefeller Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The new vaccines have entered the final stage of development,
according to the CVI's report.
</P>
<P>
The report also noted that another 4 million young lives could
be spared annually if widespread use of existing vaccines against
measles, hepatitis B, Hib pneumonia and meningitis, and neonatal
tetanus is strengthened.
</P>
<P>
"But these children's lives won't be saved without prompt
action to increase the worldwide rate of child immunization," said
Carol Bellamy, UNICEF's executive director.
</P>
<P>
She noted that over 80 percent of young children are immunized
against the six major killer diseases today, compared to less than
5 percent in 1979.
</P>
<P>
"This means about 3 million fewer children die each year than
before, and it is a major public health achievement," Bellamy
said. "However, since 1990 the percentage of children vaccinated
has not increased significantly, and no new vaccines have been
introduced on a large scale in developing countries."

<HEADLINE> Egypt: Sudanese President's Visit Not Fixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said today the projected visit of Sudanese President Omar
al Bashir to Cairo was not yet decided.
</P>
<P>
In a statement after meeting with Sudanese Minister of State
for Foreign Relations Mustafa Osman Ismail, Moussa denied any
change in the Egyptian policy towards Sudan, asserting that its
stance has not changed at all.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt is always keen on the unity and sovereignty of Sudan
under all circumstances," he said, adding that his meeting with
Ismail dealt with the situation in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Ismail told reporters that Sudan is exerting its utmost for "a
comprehensive normalization of all files related to bilateral
relations between Egypt and Sudan."
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese official said no date was set so far for Bashir's
visit to Cairo. However, he said "all files" are at present
discussed.
</P>
<P>
"There is no need to jump to this step. And the visit will take
place," he added.
</P>
<P>
Media reports have said the Sudanese president wants to visit
Cairo, but Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said on December 24
that no date for such a visit had been set.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese minister said a delegation under Deputy Speaker of
the Sudanese Parliament Abdel Aziz Shadu will attend the 30th Arab
Parliamentary Union conference to be held in the Upper Egyptian
town of Luxor on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But he denied that Sudan's Islamist leader Hassan el-Turabi,
Speaker of the Sudanese Parliament, will attend this conference,
as reported by the Sudanese Alwan independent newspaper on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Cairo has in the past accused Sudan of supporting Muslim
militants seeking to oust Mubarak and install a purist Islamic
state in Egypt. It has also charged Khartoum with sheltering
gunmen who tried to assassinate Mubarak in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Sudan denied the charges and criticized Egypt for letting
Sudan's opposition in exile operate from Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The neighbors are also at odds over a border disput, but there
have been signs of a tentative thaw in relations.

NEW YORK, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Silicon Valley, a

<HEADLINE> 6 Arrested for Assassination Attempt on Iraqi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 12 (Xinhua) -- A senior Jordanian government
official Monday confirmed that six people holding Iraqi passports
have been arrested in connection with the January 3 assassination
attempt on an Iraqi diplomat in Amman.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State for Information Affairs Samir Mutawe told the
official news agency Petra that the police were interrogating the
six people detained earlier on suspicion of trying to kill Abdul
Rahim Taher, Commercial Councillor at the Iraqi Embassy in Amman,
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
All of the arrested holding Iraqi passports admitted to the
police that their assassination attempt had no political purpose,
but private or family reasons, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
On January 5, Iraqi ambassador to Jordan Nouri Al Weiss has
said that the assassination attempt was carried out "by some
elements who do not want to see any rapprochement in relations
between Jordan and Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Taher laid blames on "either the Iraqi opposition or Israel or
the United States."
</P>
<P>
During the attack, neither Taher, 45, nor his 14-year-old son,
was injured, but his car was hit.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iraq and Jordan deteriorated after Iraq
executed four Jordanians on charges of smuggling car spare parts
into Iraq. Jordan recalled its charge d'affaires from Baghdad and
expelled seven Iraqi diplomats in retaliation.
</P>
<P>
However, bilateral ties have been improved since Iraq agreed to
renew a contract to sell oil to Jordan at favorable prices last
December.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Cut Subsidies to Public Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has
decided to reduce subsidies to the public enterprises sector by
80 percent from 208 billion Shillings (200 million US Dollars) in
1994 to 38 billion Shillings (about 35 million Dollars) by the
year 2000, a local report said today.
</P>
<P>
According to a subsidy reduction plan prepared by the Public
Enterprise Reform and Diverstiture Secretariat, it is part of a
three year budget framework paper effective in 1996-97 financial
year.
</P>
<P>
The plan noted that Uganda Railways Corporation (URC) is the
biggest recipient of government subsidies although it provides
fewer services than the road sector.
</P>
<P>
The annual cost of URC's non commercial services totalling 8.8
billion Shillings puts a great burden on government's scarce
resources and is running down both URC and government, it pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
The recently concluded financial restructuring study showed
that even with full compensation, URC shall still incur large
operating losses.
</P>
<P>
The plan was made in accordance with a preliminary subsidy
analysis of some samples of the public enterprises undertaken
with the International Finance Corporation (IFC).

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today called on Iraq not to take "precipitous" actions
on the U.N. weapons inspection team led by an American before the
chief U.N. weapons inspector arrives in Baghdad for planned talks
next week.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the Iraqi authorities will not do anything precipitous
and wait for Richard Butler to get there," said Annan when asked
to comment at a regular press briefing on the reported Iraqi
threat to ban the U.N. weapons team.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has decided to halt the work of the U.N. inspection team
led by Scott Ritter, a U.S. marine Corps captain during the 1991
Gulf War, the official Iraqi news agency INA said earlier in the
day.
</P>
<P>
Bagdad has accused Ritter of spying for the United States and
placing obstacles in the way of implementing U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
It also said that the composition of the U.N. team was not
balanced in participation of the permanent member states of the
U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The team is composed of nine Americans, five British, one
Russian and one Australian.
</P>
<P>
Butler is expected to arrive in Baghdad on January 19 for a
brief visit, U.N. officials said. His talks will focus on access
to suspected weapons sites and other operational issues in the
next step of the U.N. arms inspection in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Annan told reporters that the U.N. team had not decided to halt
any inspections although Baghdad had decided to stop its work.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said that Butler was drafting a
letter to the Security Council officially informing it of Iraq's
decision on barring the U.N. team from carrying out its work as
from Tuesday because of its composition.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin promised Monday evening that the government will provide
"all means necessary" to back the investigation on the robbery
of Jewish properties in France by Nazis during World War II.
</P>
<P>
The president of the commission, Jean Matteoli, Monday
presented to Jospin the first phase report of his investigation,
in which he said that for the time being, he cannot make any
concrete proposals on how to compensate the families of the Jews
who were robbed.
</P>
<P>
He asked government to provide him with "other means" of
investigation, taking into account the "fullness and complexity
of the sources to be consulted with."
</P>
<P>
Jospin praised Matteoli for the accomplishment he has made so
far since the commission was set up one year ago by the former
government of Prime Minister Alain Juppe.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the commission is to determine under which
conditions the properties of Jews were robbed in France by the
Nazis and their French collaborators from 1940 to 1944.
</P>
<P>
The London international conference held in December last year
set up an international fund to compensate Jews.
</P>
<P>
The fund will be established with contribution from wartime
victorious nations such as the United States and Britain, which
seized a large number of Nazi properties.
</P>
<P>
France, which has also taken back some robbed wealth from
Germany after the war, has not decided yet whether it will join
the fund or not, and said it prefers to compensate the Jews on a
national basis.
</P>
<P>
Matteoli suggested in his report that France join the
international fund.

<HEADLINE> Amour Stresses Zanzibar Unity, Development at </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZANZIBAR (TANZANIA), January 12 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar President
Salmin Amour today called on the people to maintain unity and
strive to develop economy today when addressing a ceremony here
to mark the 34th anniversary of the Zanzibar Revolution.
</P>
<P>
Amour said severely hit by drought and floods over the past
year as well as the on-going outbreak of cholera and malaria,
Zanzibar economy suffered greatly and hundreds of lives lost.
</P>
<P>
Despite difficulties, Zanzibar is expected to enjoy an
economic growth rate of 6.3 percent in 1997 against the 3.7
percent in the previous year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa, Prime Minister Frederick
Sumaye, and senior Zanzibar government officials inspected a
guard of honor mounted by the armed and police forces at the
Amman Stadium in a heavy rain this morning.
</P>
<P>
Amour said in his 20-minute speech that the Zanzibar
government welcomes more foreign investments and will try its
best to develop the economy in various sectors including the
private one.
</P>
<P>
He also warned leaders of certain political parties on abiding
by the Constitution instead of inciting antagonism among the
innocent people under the pretext of developing democracy and
human rights. Otherwise, they will be punished according to law,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The Zanzibar president also urged government officials to be
honest and businessmen to be lawful and corruption to be punished
particularly in the sector of foreign investment to guarantee the
healthy, sustainable and self-relied development of economy.
</P>
<P>
Formerly a British protectorate, Zanzibar became independent
sultanate on Dec 10, 1963. Following an armed uprising led by the
Afro-Shirazi Party on January 12, 1964, the Sultan was deposed
and a republic proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
The new government signed an Act of Union with the Tanganyika
Republic on April 26, 1964, thus creating the United Republic of
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
With its own constitution, president, government and
parliament, Zanzibar can independently handle affairs except in
the sectors of foreign relationship, national defense and
security.
</P>
<P>
A popular tourist destination consisting of two major islands,
Zanzibar and Pemba, along with several other smaller islands in
the Indian Ocean, Zanzibar is inhabited by nearly one million
residents 95 percent of which are Moslems.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Tougher Penalties for Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said on Monday he will urge states to toughen penalties for drug
trafficking in prisons and will earmark 200 million dollars to
promote drug abstinence and treatment in the criminal justice
system.
</P>
<P>
"Somehow, jail time has to be cold turkey for those who are
addicted and must represent unemployment for those who are drug
dealers," said Barry McCaffrey, director of the Office of National
Drug Control Policy.
</P>
<P>
Across the United States, 1.6 million men and women are in
federal, state and local prisons. In tests last year, 9 percent of
those checked tested positive for drugs behind bars, McCaffrey
said. The problem was much worse in state and local jails than in
federal prisons, he said.
</P>
<P>
Between 50 percent to 80 percent of prison population is
incarcerated because of drug- or alcohol-related crime, McCaffrey
said.
</P>
<P>
"The president believes we must have `zero tolerance' for drug
use and trafficking within our nation's prison system," a White
House statement said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton announced his initiative in an Oval Office ceremony.
Details were announced in advance.
</P>
<P>
Clinton directed Attorney General Janet Reno to draft
legislation, in consultation with states, that would require them
to toughen penalties for drug trafficking into and within
correctional facilities. States that did not comply could lose
prison construction funds from the federal government.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also instructed Reno to take steps requiring states to
determine the level of drug use in their prisons and report
annually on whether they are making progress in reducing drug use
and availability.
</P>
<P>
States would be granted flexibility to use federal prison funds
for drug detection, offender testing and drug treatment.
</P>
<P>
A report last week by the National Center on Addiction and
Substance Abuse at Columbia University estimated that alcohol and
illegal drugs contributed to the incarceration of 80 percent of
the 1.7 million inmates in the nation's prisons. The report also
said that most of them were not being treated for addiction before
being released.
</P>
<P>
The administration has increased to 42 from 32 the number of
drug treatment centers in federal prisons and more than tripled
the number of federal inmates undergoing substance abuse treatment
-- from 5,450 in 1993 to 19,943 in the last fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Pak Faces No Immediate Threat from East Asia Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Eminent economists and
financial experts of Pakistan held a meeting here Tuesday
discussing measures to make the country responsive to the
challenges of globalization.
</P>
<P>
The three-hour-long meeting, chaired by Minister of State and
Chief Coordinator of Pakistan 2010 Program Ahsan Iqbal, foresees
no immediate threat to Pakistan in the wake of the East Asian
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Ahsan Iqbal, while introducing the topic at the onset,
underlined the importance of the East Asian financial crisis and
its implications for Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He described the challenges of globalization as a common threat
which, he said, required flexible labor market, efficient economic
system and productivity-oriented economy to cope with.
</P>
<P>
The lessons Pakistan should draw is to reduce vulnerability and
try to avoid mistakes of these countries, he believed.
</P>
<P>
Iqbal said that though Pakistan did not have structural
problems, similar to these countries, its negative effects cannot
be ignored in the backdrop of global scenario and economic
interdependence.
</P>
<P>
The minister observed that there was a need for a flexible
economic strategy in the face of the dynamic global market.
</P>
<P>
While discussing the factors of the economic upheaval in East
Asia on Pakistan, the Joint Director of the Pakistan Institute of
Development Economics (PIDE), Ashfaq Khan, forecast the likelihood
of a drop in export earnings and a pressure on trade and current
account balances.
</P>
<P>
Ashfaq believed that, to the extent that Pakistan competes with
these countries in Asian, European and North American markets, its
product will become non-competitive in these markets and may
affect export earnings.
</P>
<P>
He also foresaw difficulties for Pakistan in borrowing from the
market and its efforts to attract the much needed foreign
investment.

<HEADLINE> China Provides 22 Million Yuan For Tibetan Blizzard Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) - China's central government has
provided 22 million yuan (about three million US dollars) in
relief funds for the Tibet Autonomous Region for the worst snow
disaster seen in decades, a Civil Affairs Ministry official said
today.
</P>
<P>
Since September, the prefectures of Nagqu, Ngari, Xigaze and
Shannan, have been hit by heavy snowstorms. By mid-December, new
snowfalls along the Himalayas cut communications between a number
of counties, towns and villages in these four prefectures, where
400,000 people and nearly 10 million head of livestock live.
</P>
<P>
According to Li Bengong, director of Disaster Relief Department
of the Civil Affairs Ministry, the department has been closely
monitoring the disaster in Tibet from the beginning. On December
3, it provided 12 million yuan in winter disaster relief funds to
the autonomous region and increased that by 10 million yuan on
January 6.
</P>
<P>
At present, all major roads have been cleared of snow and
relief materials are mainly being moved by People's Liberation
Army troops in Tibet and neighboring Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
It may take four or five years for some of the worst hit
regions, where a large number of livestock froze or starved to
death, to recover from the disaster.

<HEADLINE> Early 20's Steam Locomotive Joins HK Railway Museum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 13 (Xinhua) -- A historic Kowloon-Canton
Railway (KCR) steam locomotive, which was manufactured about three
quarters of a century ago in 1923, will be put on permanent
display at the Hong Kong Railway Museum.
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's donation ceremony, Chairman of the Provisional
Regional Council Lau Wong-fat received the donation on behalf of
the council from Chairman and Chief Executive of the
Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation (KCRC) K. Y. Yeung.
</P>
<P>
At the Hong Kong Railway Museum which opened in 1985, a
collection of railway artifacts including six early KCR coaches
dated back from 1911 to 1974 and two old trolleys have been on
display.
</P>
<P>
However, no steam locomotives were available, as they were
either sold abroad or dismantled with the advent of diesel
traction in the 1950s, said Lau.
</P>
<P>
After extensive search two steam locomotives which had formerly
served on the Fanling-Sha Tau Kok branch of the KCR were found in
the Philippines. Then the KCRC negotiated with the owner of the
locomotives to arrange for the purchase and transfer back to Hong
Kong.

<HEADLINE> Two Kims Urge Formation of Three-Way Consultation Organ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 13 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Young-sam and President-elect Kim Dae-jung Tuesday called for the
creation of a consultative body composed of labor, business
and political leaders to lead the country out of its economic
woes.
</P>
<P>
We would like to emphasize that the success or failure of the
three-way cooperation will determine the fate of our country, the
two Kims said in a statement issued after their second weekly
meeting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Government and political leaders are trying hard to persuade
labor groups to withdraw their opposition to the legalization of
layoffs and join the tripartite body.
</P>
<P>
The visiting head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
Michel Camdessus also urged business leaders on Monday to agree to
the legalization of layoffs.
</P>
<P>
Permitting mass layoffs is one of the harsh key conditions of
the economic restructuring program imposed by the IMF in exchange
for a rescue loan of 57 billion U.S. dollars. Since late 1997, the
country has suffered a financial crisis caused by the collapse of
conglomerates and bad loans of financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the two Kims also hailed the agreement reached
by the nation's four largest business groups to restructure their
business and share the burden of the current economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
However, both voiced their hope that the four business groups --
Samsung, Hyundai, Lg and Sunkung -- will fulfil the agreement without
failure.
</P>
<P>
"We hope they will carry out their resolutions faithfully," the
statement said.

LHASA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- People's Liberation Army troops

At times, the drivers have to dig the trucks out of deep snow,
and many have had only one meal per day for the past two
weeks. Seventy percent of the soldiers have been hit by some form
of illness.

Bianba Qunpei, a Tibetan woman whose five-member family had had
not food or fuel for three days, said the People's Liberation Army
troops have saved the lives of her family.

<HEADLINE> Asian Countries Called On To Coordinate Efforts In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
called on Asian nations involved in the current financial crisis
on Tuesday to coordinate their efforts in trying to tide over the
difficult time and express its willingness to help Asia overcome
the challenge.
</P>
<P>
Delivering the inaugural Asia-Europe Lecture here, Jacques
Santer, president of the European Commission, said the EU
"strongly encourage Asian countries to use this difficult moment
to coordinate their efforts in tackling the roots of the crisis."
</P>
<P>
"The EU, with over 40 years of experience in that field, is
happy to share its experiences," Santer said in his lecture,
entitled "Asia and Europe: The Road From Bangkok to London and
Beyond".
</P>
<P>
Noting that the problems in Asia are having their effect
throughout the international economy, Santer said there was little
that was inherently "Asian" about the causes of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Asian economies are very dynamic economies, with a solid
resource base, high savings ratios, skilled labor, and
entrepreneurial dynamism," he said, adding that it is "an abiding
and universal lesson" that an expanding economy requires a sound,
transparent and open policy framework, and that corrective
measures, while never popular, are most effective when taken
promptly.
</P>
<P>
"This applies in East and South East Asian as much as it
applies in Europe," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Looking forward, he said the factors which will help the
recovery are clear. The economic fundamentals of Asia remain
healthy. Sound fundamentals accompanied by sound policies, with
appropriate and stable exchange rates, transparent financial
regulation, and prudent fiscal and monetary policies, will help
ensure that confidence is quickly restored, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Asia-Europe Lecture is organized by the Asia-Europe
Foundation (ASEF) and is designed to provide leading statesmen,
scholars, scientists and other leaders of civil society with a
platform to address an informed audience on trends and issues
pertaining to Asia-Europe relations.
</P>
<P>
The ASEF, established on February 15, 1997, by members of the
Asia-Europe Meeting, seeks to promote better mutual understanding
between Asia and Europe through greater intellectual, cultural and
people-to-people exchange.

<HEADLINE> HK's 1997 Overall Crime Rate Reaches Decade Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's overall crime
rate for 1997 reached its lowest level in two decades,
Commissioner of Police Eddie Hui Ki-on told the media here on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the work of the Commissioner of Police in the past
year, Hui said that the overall number of crimes recorded dropped
by 15 percent compared with 1996.
</P>
<P>
There was a marked decrease for the fourth consecutive year in
burglaries and robberies, down by 17 percent and 24 percent
respectively, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hui said even more pleasing is the 61 percent drop in the
number of bank, watch and gold shop robberies, adding: "Our
detection rate of 51.4 percent compares favorably with other
densely populated cities world-wide."
</P>
<P>
Throughout the year, he said, the Police Force has continued
its determined enforcement action against drug trafficking and
drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
"Operations mounted locally and internationally have been
successful in preventing the large scale importation of illicit
drugs, particularly heroin, methylamphetamine and ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
"Our long standing relationships with key overseas law
enforcement agencies have been crucial in ensuring that we play an
important role in the international fight against drugs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting the 17 percent reduction in triad related crime over the
past year, Hui said the successful confiscation of criminal assets
at the end of 1997 stood at 261 million Hong Kong dollars (33.46
million U.S. dollars), with a further 244 million Hong Kong
dollars (31.28 million U.S. dollars) either frozen or pending
confiscation.
</P>
<P>
Besides, he said that the Commissioner of Police received a
total of 2,939 complaints against the Police Force from the public
last year, showing a decrease of 370 cases compared with 1996.
</P>
<P>
Corruption complaints against police officers decreased by 12.5
percent from 576 in 1996 to 512 in 1997, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hui said that after Hong Kong returned to China on July 1, last
year, "We continue to enforce the law in exactly the same way as
before."
</P>
<P>
The concern that police officers in senior ranks would leave
the service prior to the transfer of the power has proven to be
unfounded, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The vast majority of expatriate officers remained committed to
Hong Kong and the Police Force, with 402 remaining in the Force at
the end of 1997," he said.
</P>
<P>
A recent public opinion survey shows that 43 percent of
respondents rated the Force's overall performance as good, with 30
percent considering it very good.
</P>
<P>
Encouragingly, the overall majority, 79 percent, felt a strong
sense of safety living in Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that Hong Kong remains one of the
safest and most stable societies in the world.

Qatar.

<HEADLINE> Manila Refuses to Impose Import Surtax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Finance Secretary
Roberto de Ocampo said Tuesday that his department has turned down
a proposal to impose a temporary surcharge tax on all imports that
compete with locally produced goods.
</P>
<P>
"While we agree that domestic manufacturing firms will face a
tough test this year due to higher interest rates, higher cost of
imported inputs and low consumer confidence, we believe that the
proposal is not the remedy to these problems," de Ocampo said.
</P>
<P>
The drastic proposal was raised last week by the Federation of
Philippine Industries Inc. on the grounds that it can partially
offset the projected huge fiscal deficit of the government,
prevent massive layoffs and conserve foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
The federation warned that massive layoffs might occur
beginning this month in the event the current volatility in the
foreign exchange market persisted and interest rates showed no
signs of easing.
</P>
<P>
Describing the proposal as "counter-productive", de Ocampo said
it will affect the competitiveness of business since the imported
inputs will cost more due to the additional tariff.
</P>
<P>
The proposal has an element of protectionism which contradicts
both the government's policy on trade liberalization and the
country's commitment to the World Trade Organization (WTO), he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to de Ocampo, the Philippines has committed to the
WTO not to discriminate imported goods against domestic goods
through internal revenue taxes.
</P>
<P>
De Ocampo also doubted the proposal will increase the revenues
of the government since it will not necessarily increase
collections of the Bureau of Customs.
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said, a surtax will lower imports and might be an
incentive to smuggle or import through the duty-free shops.
</P>
<P>
A surtax is unnecessary as the exchange rate itself regulates
trade and that imports naturally decline if the exchange rate
depreciates, de Ocampo said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine peso, a victim of the Asian financial crisis,
has so far lost more than 65 percent in its value against the U.S.
dollar since its de facto devaluation in July 1997.

<HEADLINE> IMF Calls for Legalization of Mass Layoffs in SKorea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Visiting International Monetary
Fund (IMF) Managing Director Michel Camdessus said Tuesday that
South Korea has to cope wisely with great challenges that include
mass layoffs and high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference before winding up his three-day visit to
South Korea, Camdessus called for South Korea to legalize mass
layoffs in order to restore the nation's financial credibility in
the world.
</P>
<P>
He said the laws on dismissals and layoffs will be essential
for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
"In the first 10 days of this year, signs in Korea were very
good in terms of normalization of the economic crisis.The latest
improvements in various macro-economic indicators also signaled the
beginning of the economic recovery,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
But the nation has only won the first battle, not the whole
war, the IMF chief stressed.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus said the only proper way to tackle the essential
social issue of layoffs is to strengthen tripartite dialogue among
the government, union leaders and employers.
</P>
<P>
"The nation's corporate shareholders and management should also
stand ready to share the pain of unemployed workers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
On interest rates, Camdessus said there is no way to
stabilize the economy and re-establish exchange rates at a proper level,
except through a group of policies, of which higher interest rates
are an essential component.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, once the world's 11th largest economy, has been
suffering an economic crisis caused by the failure of
conglomerates and bad loans of financial institutions since late
1997.
</P>
<P>
The country's per capita wage last year fell to 9,400 U.S. dollars
from the previous year's 10,548 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Analysts predict the economic crisis will worsen in 1998 as
the nation, under an agreement signed with the IMF for rescue
loans of 57 billion U.S. dollars, will have to completely
restructure its economy.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, with foreign exchange reserves reportedly
standing at about 9 billion U.S. dollars, South Korea has to
return roughly 25 billion U.S. dollars in foreign debts before
next month.

BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Heavy snowfall in Beijing
caused a few traffic accidents in the downtown area an hour after
it began at 9 a.m. today, and many say they've not seen anything

A large number of children have been going for medical help,
according to a doctor at Beijing Children's Hospital, where there

<HEADLINE> Iran to Seek Foreign Loans for Oil Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran is to borrow 4 billion
U.S. dollars from abroad in the coming Iranian fiscal year
(starting on March 21) to inject into the country's 16 oil and gas
projects, local daily Tehran Times reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Majlis (parliament) Monday authorized the
government to seek foreign loans for its oil and gas development
projects while it cut down the expected oil revenues with
consideration of the price slide in world market.
</P>
<P>
In its draft budget for the new year, the government of
President Mohammad Khatami forecast a foreign loan of about 6.4
billion dollars from abroad. The Majlis brought down the figure to
4 billion dollars, but allowed the government to set up companies
and offices abroad to earn most needed hard currencies.
</P>
<P>
Approving parts of the budget for the new year, the Majlis
members held pessimistic views on the country's oil revenues in
the new year due to the current falling trend of oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The government predicted a 14.9 billion dollars oil income on
the basis of 17.5 dollars per barrel, but the Majlis lowered the
expected oil price to 16 dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Iran earned only 10 billion dollars from oil exports in the
first eight months of the current Iranian year and experts
believed that the annual oil income would be around 15 billion
dollars with the current oil price, some 15.5 percent less than
the projection.
</P>
<P>
Iran's oil production was 3.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in
1997 with some 2.5 million bpd for export. The country's oil
production ceiling was raised to 3.94 million bpd according to a
decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) in November.
</P>
<P>
Many parliament members have urged for a realistic projection
for the country's oil revenue in the new year budget. Debates on
details of the new budget started on Monday after the parliament
approved its outlines Sunday.

<HEADLINE> HK Voters Urged to Register for May Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 13 (Xinhua) -- With only a few days left
before the deadline for voter registration on January 16, a Hong
Kong official on Tuesday urged those who have not yet registered
to act now in order to exercise their electoral rights in the
first Legislative Council elections of the Special Administrative
Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
A voter registration exercise was carried out Tuesday by the
Home Affairs Department (HAD) at the site of the new airport at
Chek Lap Kok.
</P>
<P>
Addressing hundreds of workers who are waiting to be
registered, acting Director of Home Affairs Lui Hau-tuen said: "By
taking part in the elections, you will be helping to implement the
concept of 'one country, two systems'."
</P>
<P>
He called on all Hong Kong permanent residents aged 18 and
above who ordinarily reside in Hong Kong to register without delay
so that they would be able to cast a ballot for the candidate of
their choice in the May 24 elections.
</P>
<P>
Promotion for voter registration was stepped up with the
mobilization of 30,000 Voter Registration Ambassadors (VRAs) who
began calling on some 2 million households during the Voter
Registration Week on December 6-12 last year.
</P>
<P>
This was followed by more visits conducted in the evenings by
HAD district staff as well as VRAs to households, major charitable
and commercial organizations, hospitals and various social service
centers, and the setting up of mobile registration counters at
high population concentration areas, the official added.
</P>
<P>
"The multi-facet approach has allowed us to collect more than
470,000 voter registration forms as of Tuesday. But we would like
to register as many eligible voters as possible," Lui said.

<HEADLINE> Business Receipts Up for Most of HK's Service Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Business receipts in most of
Hong Kong service industries showed remarkable year-on-year
increases in the third quarter of 1997, the Census and Statistics
Department revealed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The value of business receipts in the financing (except
banking) industry registered the fastest growth -- 66 percent.
This was followed by the communications industry which recorded a
26 percent increase in business receipts, provisional figures from
the department showed.
</P>
<P>
The robust increase in the financing (except banking) industry
was due to significantly higher stock market turnover and strong
performance of the capital market in the third quarter. Reflecting
this, within the industry, the financial markets and fund
management sector recorded triple-digit growth of 131 percent in
business receipts.
</P>
<P>
The surge in business receipts in the communications industry
was attributable to the rapid expansion of the telecommunications
industry.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, considerable increases in business receipts were
also registered in the real estate, business services, insurance
and banking industries.
</P>
<P>
But business receipts in the tourism, convention and exhibition
services domain and the hotels industry dropped by 21 percent and
15 percent, respectively, in the quarter, when there was a steep
decline in the number of tourist arrivals partly due to the
regional currency turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is a services-dominated economy with the services
industry contributing 84 percent of its gross domestic product.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Merapi Volcano Continues to Spew hot gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Merapi volcano in
Indonesia's Central Java province has again spewed hot gas in
recent days and security around the volcano has been stepped up to
a state of alert, Antara News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The hot gas has reached 0.8 kilometer toward the Sat river, as
red-hot lava flowed to the upper reaches of the Krasak, Bebeng,
Boyong and Senowo rivers, said the report quoting an official of
local volcanological research center in Yogyakarta.
</P>
<P>
In the past week, the official said, smoke has been rising to
about 385 meters from the tip of Merapi.
</P>
<P>
The volcano's increasing activities brought about one volcanic
earthquake, 12 multi-phase earthquakes, 19 low-frequency
earthquakes, 10 tectonic earthquakes and 42 occasions of fallout
tremors, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Merapi volcano is classified by vulcanologists as an
"explosive" type, similar to the volcano which devastated the
Caribbean island of Martinique at the turn of the century and left
29,000 dead.
</P>
<P>
Merapi rises to a height of 2,926 meters. To the east it
overlooks the most famous Indonesian monument, the Buddhist temple
of Borobodur, and 30 kilometers to the south the university city
of Yogyakarta, where one million people live.
</P>
<P>
The region is a geologically unstable area which makes up part
of the Pacific "ring of fire".

<HEADLINE> HK Fund Redemptions Modest Despite Market Volatility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Sales activities of unit
trusts were subdued in November last year, with gross sales
dropping to a meager 255.12 million U.S. dollars, the Hong Kong
Investment Funds Association (HKIFA) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The general investment sentiment in Asia remained weak in the
month as uncertainties over the outcome of the Asian currency
turmoil lingered on, said Peter Lord, chairman of the HKIFA.
</P>
<P>
However, Lord said, "although the lingering uncertainties
resulted in sluggish sales and continuous net outflows in certain
sectors in November, redemptions were not massive nor took place
at a scale that exacerbated the financial crisis."
</P>
<P>
In fact, new outflows for November were low at 1.65 million
U.S. dollars. Moreover, six out of the 14 fund sectors actually
managed to register new inflows.
</P>
<P>
Among the various sectors that registered net inflows, bond
funds that is viewed as a safe haven was the most popular,
recording net inflows of 39.69 million U.S. dollars for the month.
</P>
<P>
Another haven in times of high market volatility -- cash funds
-- took the second place, registering net inflows of 11.10 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong equity funds managed to register net inflows, albeit
marginal, in November, with gross inflows amounting to around 31
million U.S. dollars
</P>
<P>
Among all Asian sectors, Hong Kong equity funds was the only
sector that had managed to register net inflows in all 11 months
in 1997, although the level of net inflows had dwindled in
November.
</P>
<P>
The HKIFA consists of 45 fund management companies as
full/overseas members. It has about 40 associate members including
 trustees and other professionals which are involved in the
creation and administration of funds.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Ready for Talks with Thailand on PULO Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is ready to
discuss with its neighbor Thailand on the issue of a Thai rebel
group known as the Pattani United Liberation Organization (PULO)
whose members are said to be trained in Malaysia, its Foreign
Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia voiced its readiness to Thai Deputy Foreign Minister
Sukhumbhand Paribatra who called on Abdullah here Tuesday to make
arrangements for the official visit by Thai Foreign Minister Surin
Pitsuwan to Malaysia next month, the Malaysian national news
agency Bernama reported, quoting Abdullah himself.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said Thailand was aware of Malaysia's
"non-interference" stand in the internal affairs of its neighbors
or other countries.
</P>
<P>
He said he told Sukhumbhand that he was open on that issue and
if Thailand had information, it could discuss the matter during
Surin's visit.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want Malaysia to be used as a base by any groups from
neighboring countries...that's our policy," Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
"Sukhumbhand informed me that if Thailand has information and
proof on the matter, it will be conveyed by Surin," Abdullah was
quoted as telling reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
On the visit, Surin's first official visit to Malaysia since
his appointment to the post, Abdullah said Surin was keen to
discuss the Malaysia-Thailand Joint Commission meeting and
unresolved joint border issues.
</P>
<P>
The Thai foreign minister is also expected to propose several
measures to enhance bilateral ties particularly in tackling
problems arising from the currency crisis faced by Malaysia and
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Defense Minister Syed Hamid Albar earlier on January
4 described as unfounded reports that Malaysia was the training
ground for the PULO, saying Malaysia does not allow foreign
separatist groups to train in this country.

PERTH, January 13 (Xinhua) -- American Kristy Kowal surged
ahead in the home stretch to become the women's 100m breaststroke
world champion on Tuesday, beating a strong field which included
Olympic gold medalist, European champion and world No.1 ranked
swimmer.
</P>
<P>
Kowal, 19, quickened her stroke with 20 meters left and touched
home first in her personal best time of 1:08.42.
</P>
<P>
She looked at the timeboard in disbelief. After several
seconds, Kowal realized that she was the winner, pumping her fist
into air in celebration.
</P>
<P>
Australian Helen Denman got the silver medal in 1:08.51, 0.15
clear of bronze medalist Lauren van Oosten of the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Reigning world champion Agnes Kovacs missed the medal podium by
a narrow 0.02 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Penny Heyns, South Africa's Olympic champion and world record
holder, finished fifth in 1:08.77 with world top-ranked swimmer
Samantha Riley of Australia in sixth place.
</P>
<P>
Riley, a pre-race title favorite, turned first at the wall but
lost momentum as the race went to the home stretch. She clocked
1:08.80, 1.14 seconds outside of her 1997 world best time.
</P>
<P>
Australia might have got some solace, if not happiness, in the
men's 4x200m relay final, in which they had boasted to produce the
first record at the championships.
</P>
<P>
The Aussie quartet, paced by newly crowned 200m freestyle king
Michael Klim, triumphed in a new meet mark of 7:12.48, 4.29
seconds faster than the Netherlands which picked the silver medal.
</P>
<P>
Britain won the first medal in the championships as it timed
7:17.33 for third place.
</P>
<P>
Olympic champion Claudia Poll came in first to take the women's
200m freestyle top honor.
</P>
<P>
The Costa Rican star, who possesses a deadly-efficient stroke
and blinding speed that can be unleashed at any time, clocked
1:58.90 for the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
Martina Moravcova of Slovakia lifted the silver medal in
1:59.61, 0.31 clear of bronze medalist Jilia Greville of Australia.
</P>
<P>
American Tom Dolan was the other Olympic champion who remained
unbeaten here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Dolan timed 4:14.95, over two seconds away from his world
record but good enough to beat Dutchman Marcel Wouda into second
spot.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Curtis Myden was third in 4:16.45.
</P>
<P>
Dolan was the only fourth American to win back-to-back world
championship titles. The others include Tom Jager, Matt Biondi
and Janet Evans.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Russian Dmitry Sautin beat his closest rival by over
50 points to grab the men's 3m springboard title.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Zhou Yilin got the silver medal in 694.92 and Vassiliy
Lisovskiy of Russia took the bronze in 651.60.
</P>
<P>
Russian Olga Sedakov was crowned in the synchronized swimming
solo, in which she put up a nearly perfect performance.
Frenchwoman Virginie Dedieu came out second with Japanese Miya
Tachibana in third place.

<HEADLINE> South Korea to Repatriate 3,000 Filipino Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will repatriate some
3,000 Filipino workers due to its raging financial crisis, the
Philippine News Agency reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said the arrangements for carrying those displaced
workers back home by the Philippine Foreign Affairs Department are
currently underway.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a ranking foreign affair official as saying
that his office is now negotiating with private airlines for the
airlift of the displaced Filipino workers in South Korea under
special terms.
</P>
<P>
The official said if they find difficulty in returning the
workers through commercial airline flights, they may be compelled
to ask the Philippine Air Force to dispatch a C-130 cargo plane to
Seoul to fetch the workers.
</P>
<P>
Of the 3,000 displaced Filipino workers in South Korea, the
official said, 93 have already returned to the Philippines on
their own account and expenses.
</P>
<P>
He added that they expect more of the laid off Filipino workers
who have money of their own to finance their airfare back to
Manila.
</P>
<P>
Reports said many of the Filipino workers who lost jobs are
unskilled labor and are undocumented who came to Korea as
tourists.
</P>
<P>
The official said the Philippine government, through the
Department of Labor and Employment, will shortly set into motion a
program designed to create jobs and absorb the displaced Filipino
workers from their overseas jobs.

<HEADLINE> China Expresses Regret Over Taiwan Leader's Philippines Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- China's Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Shen Guofang, at a press conference this afternoon,
expressed regret that the Philippines allowed the "Premier" of
Taiwan's "Executive Yuan" Siew Vincent to visit.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is demanding that the Philippine
government stick to its commitment to follow the "one China"
policy to avoid damaging bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Shen reiterated China's stance against any official relations
and exchanges with Taiwan by any country that has diplomatic
relations with China.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China has noticed the financial
difficulties encountered by some Southeast Asian and other
countries and that China understands their efforts to obtain
economic assistance within the framework of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF). But, he said, the Chinese government is
firmly opposed to Taiwan authorities participating in any form in
any official arrangements or activities in this.
</P>
<P>
China hopes that these countries will adhere to the "one China"
stand and be alert to Taiwan authorities' attempts to use money
to carry out "one China, one Taiwan" or "two Chinas" activities.
</P>
<P>
Shen said that China holds that Taiwan authorities can only
provide assistance to these countries through unofficial
channels.

JERUSALEM, January 13 (Xinhua) -- A total of 700 kilograms of
explosives were found and four activists arrested in a raid by the
Palestinian security forces on a Hamas bomb factory in the West
Bank town of Nablus Monday night, local media reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The raid was conducted with the cooperation of the Israeli army

During the raid, the explosives were found in the factory in a
residential building in Nablus, which was suspected for making
bombs and other explosive devices.

<HEADLINE> Macao Financial System Firm Before Currency Crisis: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Macao monetary chief said on
Tuesday that the currency crisis in Southeast Asia has brought no
major impact on Macao's financial system, but it will be a blow
to Macao's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese News Agency Lusa quoted Manuela Morgado,
president of the Macao Monetary and Foreign Exchange Authority
(AMCM), as saying that the impact of the Southeast Asian currency
turmoil and the stock market turbulence on Macao's financial
sector was "not very significant."
</P>
<P>
She said that large part of the Macao monetary authority's
investments were held in U.S. treasury bonds, and the local
banking sector had no Hong Kong dollar debts.
</P>
<P>
Macao's financial stability depends on the maintenance of the
local currency's peg to the Hong Kong dollar and the latter's peg
to the U.S. dollar, she said.
</P>
<P>
She defended Hong Kong government's "intransigent defense" of
the HK dollar's peg to the U.S. dollar as a "correct attitude,"
even if that means to accept a slowdown of the economy.
</P>
<P>
However, she admitted that Macao's economic growth could be
affected by the crisis. The HK dollar's peg has resulted in higher
interest rates in both Hong Kong and Macao.

<HEADLINE> Breakthrough Progress Urged in SOE Reform This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Great efforts should be made to
achieve breakthrough progress in reforming China's state-owned
enterprises this year, according to a People's Daily commentary
today.
</P>
<P>
The annual central economic conference held in Beijing by the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the
State Council from December 9-11 set six major tasks for this
year's economic work.
</P>
<P>
Among the six major tasks, completing the crucial stage of
restructuring state-owned enterprises and achieving breakthrough
progress in this regard have been considered essential to making
the whole year's work a success.
</P>
<P>
It fully demonstrates that the CPC Central Committee and the
State Council have placed advancement of reform in state-owned
enterprises at a very obvious position, said the commentary.
</P>
<P>
While calling for a thorough understanding of existing
problems, the commentary also said that it is necessary to be
confident and overcome the feeling of shrinking from the
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
Stepping up reforms in state-owned enterprises is a crucial
battle because more deep-rooted contradictions of state
enterprises, such as heavy debts and rising redundant workers,
will be fully revealed and cannot be avoided. This makes it an
urgent, as well as difficult, task to improve efficiency by laying
off workers and providing new jobs for them, said the commentary.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to forge ahead amid difficulties, and uphold
the confidence of achieving a success at the crucial stage of
restructuring the state-owned enterprises," the commentary stated.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said it is imperative to have a clear
understanding of the favorable situations for furthering reform of
state-owned enterprises, which will serve as a powerful supporting
force to make the crucial stage work of restructuring the
state-owned enterprises a success.
</P>
<P>
Three favorable conditions include:
</P>
<P>
-- Concrete measures worked out by the CPC Central Committee
and the State Council governing implementation of reform of
state-owned enterprises;
</P>
<P>
-- Greater support for restructuring state enterprises in
China's macro-policies;
</P>
<P>
-- Many precious experiences accumulated for solving problems
in state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The commentary added that it would be an inevitable outcome to
achieve a breakthrough in restructuring state enterprises, the key
to reforming the current entire economic system, as long as the
strategic goals set by the 15th CPC National Congress are pursued
with confidence and unswerving efforts.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Shares Register First Rebound in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong stocks rose 7.37
percent Tuesday for the first gain of the new year, rebounding
from a consecutive eight-day plunge since December 31 last year.
</P>
<P>
The impressive technical rebound was owed to overnight gains on
the Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The key Hang Seng index gained 598.94 points to close at
8,720.00 following seven consecutive sessions of losses of the new
year after the Wall Street overnight reversed a sharp early
slide and ended up.
</P>
<P>
The day's session recorded a turnover of 11.038 billion HK
dollars (about 1.426 billion US dollars), against the 12.332
billion HK dollars on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The key Hang Seng Index rose 212.68 points, or 2.61 percent, to
open at 8,333.74 in the morning and it gained 407.23 points, or
5.01 percent, to close at 8,528.29 at midday.
</P>
<P>
The index had dropped 773.58 points to a near three-year low in
Monday's trading amid high interest rates and the collapse of Hong
Kong-based Peregrine Investment Holdings, once Asia's largest
independent investment bank.
</P>
<P>
Factors believed to be behind the rising local market on
Tuesday included lower interbank rates, improved Asian financial
markets and the government land auctions for two sites with
lower-than-expected prices offered.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Meets Spanish Party Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- General Secretary Jiang Zemin
of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) met
here today with Joaquin Almunia, general secretary of the Spanish
Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), and his party.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also Chinese President, said that the CPC values its
friendly ties with the PSOE and hopes that bilateral exchange and
cooperation would be increased to further enhance the ties between
the two parties and two countries.
</P>
<P>
He voiced the hope that China and Spain would make joint
efforts to bring a stable and healthy Sino-Spanish relationship
into the next century.
</P>
<P>
"We are also ready to develop the exchange and cooperation with
other socialist parties in Western Europe on the basis of mutual
respect, equality and dialogue," Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
The fact that Almunia is paying a visit to China shortly after
he was elected the head of the PSOE demonstrates that the PSOE and
Almunia himself attach great importance to the friendly
cooperative ties with the CPC, said Jiang.

<P>
The friendly cooperation between the two parties has witnessed
constant development since the CPC and the PSOE established
relations more than a decade ago, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his appreciation for the Spanish government's
positive policy about China.
</P>
<P>
Almunia said that increasing contacts between the PSOE and the
CPC would help promote mutual understanding. The common ground
shared by the PSOE and the CPC outweighs the differences between
the two parties, he said.

The relations between Spain and China are developing smoothly
with increased bilateral economic and trade cooperation, said
Almunia. he expressed his belief that the links and cooperation
between the two parties and two countries would be reinforced.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Adopts Document Outlining PNA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Cabinet Tuesday
adopted a document that outlines the obligations it demands the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to fulfill before Israel
carries out second further troop redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The document was compiled by Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh,
who was appointed by the cabinet as head of a ministerial
committee which will monitor the PNA's fulfillment of these
obligations.
</P>
<P>
The obligations, outlined according to the Hebron accord
signed a year ago, requires the PNA to revise the Palestinian
Charter calling for Israel's destruction, fight terror and
prevent violence against Israel, and restrict the number of
Palestinian police forces and the PNA activities in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted the document as stressing that any Israeli
further troop redeployment is contingent on the PNA's fulfillment
of these commitments.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the establishment of the ministerial monitoring
committee, the cabinet also considered the involvement of the
United States in the follow-ups. The U.S. as the leading mediator
mediated and witnessed the signing of the Hebron accord.
</P>
<P>
No timetable was set in the document for the PNA to fulfill its
commitments, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has
said that he favors a five-month trial period to assess the PNA
actions in these above-mentioned areas.
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure of the United States, Netanyahu announced
last Thursday that he would split the decision on the second
Israeli further redeployment in the West Bank into two decisions.
</P>
<P>
The first decision on the pullback scope is to be made ahead of
his visit to Washington to meet U.S. President Bill Clinton late
this month, while another decision be made five months later on
whether to carry out the pullback based on the PNA's fulfillment
of its commitments.
</P>
<P>
This move was termed as an attempt to further delay the
redeployment in order to avoid hardliners within Israel's
splintered coalition from toppling the government.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is also to meet with PNA leader Yasser Arafat in
a bid to narrow the gap between the sides so to advance
the stalled peace process. PNA officials have warned that a
failure of the Washington talks could lead to renewed popular
Palestinian struggle.

the Chinese people and the US people's desire to develop Sino-US
relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that, for the fundamental interests of the two peoples
and for world peace and development, the two countries' leaders
decided to establish stable Sino-US cooperative relations oriented
to the 21st century, and that this was an important step forward
in Sino-US relations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that the Taiwan issue has always been a key
issue and the most important and sensitive one in bilateral
relations, and that the key to healthy and steady bilateral
relations is strictly abiding by the three Sino-US joint
communiques and properly handling the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
Perry said that the American people think that Jiang's visit to
the US last year was successful and further improved bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
The two sides should seize the opportunity and implement the
various agreements the two leaders reached and that the US should
observe the principles spelled out in the three joint communiques,
he said, and added that he hopes the two countries and their
military forces can increase exchanges and cooperation for greater
progress in bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Among those who were present at the meeting were Vice-Chairman
of China's Central Military Commission, State Councillor and

International Development (USAID) will give Zambia 18.5 million
U.S. Dollars this year compared to 16.5 million Dollars for the
country in 1997, Financial Mail reported today.

project and non-project grants, loans and food commodity
assistance to Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The USAID programs have been centered on improved agricultural
production, improved health and democratic governance.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique to Sell Two Tons of Elephant Tusks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 13 (Xinhua) -- A Mozambican wildlife official
has said the country might sell two tons of elephant tusks soon
under the arrangement of the Convention on International Trade of
Endangered Species (CITES).
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Noticias today quoted Sansao Bonito, director
of the National Bureau for Forest and Wild Animals, as announcing
the news here Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to him, a group of CITES experts will visit
Mozambique this month in a bid to be acquainted with the
situation of the country's accumulated tusks since 1989, when
tusk sale was first banned.
</P>
<P>
Individuals and institutions who own ivory tusks must make
their sale to the National Bureau for Forest and Wild Animals or
to other relevant provincial agencies, Bonito said.
</P>
<P>
"Inspection measures will be implemented, under which those
violating the rules will be punished," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Bonito revealed that those allowed for sale include raw tusk
as well as tusk products. They could be sold after appraisal by
international experts.
</P>
<P>
This is part of the efforts by the international community to
restrict tusk trade, especially in African countries.
</P>
<P>
"When some of the countries still have a large reserve of
tusks, there could be no talking about a complete ban on tusk
trade," said the director.
</P>
<P>
The investigation results by the CITES experts will be
announced at an international meeting in March, when decisions on
the ways of tusk sale are made.
</P>
<P>
Bonito indicated that there might be two ways for the sale,
one to sell them to Japan, which is a potential consumer of
tusks; the other is to make the sale to donors' group before they
are destroyed.

<HEADLINE> Macao Airport Not Affected by Currency Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Macao Airport has seen a normal
operation this year amid a currency crisis in Southeast Asia, a
senior airport executive said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Joao Moreira, chairman of the Board of Directors of the Macao
Airport Franchise Company (CAM), told Xinhua that the airport has
seen no obvious decline in its passenger flow.
</P>
<P>
About 4,000 passengers have traveled via the airport each day
this year and the figure is just as normal as in any other day
last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, about half of the passengers are from Taiwan, which
has not been strongly hit by the crisis. Taiwan passengers still
go to China's mainland via Macao by using the quasi-direct flight
service between Taipei, Kaohsiung and several mainland
destinations.
</P>
<P>
Moreira predicted that the passenger flow will not see a
decline until April as the holidays of the Chinese Lunar New Year,
or the Spring Festival, draw near.
</P>
<P>
The chairman remains firm on his company's set target of an
expected passenger growth rate of 12.8 percent in 1998. He said
more promotion effort will be made this year in China's mainland
to attract more mainland passengers to travel abroad via Macao.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the company plans to increase its cargo shipment
service this year.
</P>
<P>
The airport handled about 2 million passengers in 1997, up 50
percent from 1996, while its cargo shipments reached 45,540 tons,
up 82 percent.

<HEADLINE> HK New Airport Opens in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will open the new
airport at Chek Lap Kok on July 6, 1998, the first Monday of the
month, a government spokesman announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On opening, the new airport, to be known as the Hong Kong
International Airport, will be of world class with supporting
facilities, including the Airport Railway, ready for operation.
</P>
<P>
"We have to ensure what is available on Day One is a world
class airport supported by efficient transport arrangement," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Judging from current works progress, the new airport should be
ready for operation in late April, and the Mass Transit Railway
Corporation has confirmed that the Airport Railway will be
available in late June as originally scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The new airport had originally been scheduled to open in April
this year.
</P>
<P>
"The commissioning of the new airport and the Airport Railway
in tandem will be significant. It will also denote the successful
conclusion of the 155-billion-HK-dollar (20 billion U.S. dollars)
Airport Core Program," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
On July 6, which is the first Monday in July, the new airport
will start operation "as we need a Sunday night with lighter road
traffic to facilitate a smooth airport relocation exercise and as
air traffic also happens to be lighter on Monday," the spokesman
noted.
</P>
<P>
The new airport is the largest single construction project ever
undertaken in Hong Kong. Unlike the existing Kai Tak airport, the
new one will be able to operate around the clock.
</P>
<P>
During its initial operation, it will be able to handle up to
35 million passengers and 3 million tons of cargo a year. Upon
full development in the longer term, the airport will have an
annual throughput capacity of 87 million passengers and 9 million
tons of cargo.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, 29.5 million passengers and 1.56 million tons of cargo
passed through Kai Tak. According to Airport Council
International's figures, Hong Kong ranks first in international
air cargo throughput and third in terms of international
passengers.
</P>
<P>
The Airport Railway is designed to carry about 40 percent of
air passengers. It will take passengers from Central, Hong Kong
Island, to the new airport in 23 minutes. In-town check-in
facilities are available at the Central Station and Kowloon
Station.

<HEADLINE> Electronic Purse Becoming Popular in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Seven more Hong Kong banks
Tuesday joined the line of issuers to Visa Cash, a stored value
card known as "electronic purse".
</P>
<P>
Visa International singed agreement Tuesday with the seven new
member banks, including the Bank of East Asia, Chekiang First
Bank, Citibank, Hong Kong Chinese Bank, Shanghai Commercial Bank,
Wing Hang Bank and Wing Lung Bank.
</P>
<P>
So far, 21 banks in Hong Kong have joined the electronic cash
payment system, with 13 sister banks under the Bank of China Group
and Standard Chartered Bank as the pioneers.
</P>
<P>
Visa Cash was first introduced in Hong Kong in August 1996. As
a handy and convenient "electronic purse", Visa Cash card reduces
the need to carry cash or coins for small payment, say, at fast
food chains, vending machines and petrol stations.
</P>
<P>
Up to date, a total of 210,000 Visa Cash cards have been issued
in Hong Kong. The transaction volume has exceeded 28 million HK
dollars (3.6 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Raymond Chan, executive vice president and general manager of
the Greater China Region of Visa International, said that by the
end of 1998, the number of Visa Cash cards is expected to top
400,000.

met with Arne Carlson, governor of the US state of Minnesota, and

</P>

<HEADLINE> Egyptian President Meets Omani Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
Tuesday met with Omani Minister of State for Foreign Affairs
Yussef ben Alawi who is believed to be mediating an end to the
mounting tensions between Egypt and Qatar.
</P>
<P>
The Omani official, after talks with Mubarak this morning at
the presidential palace, said he delivered a message from Sultan
Qaboos Bin Said to Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
"We discussed means of boosting the distinguished
Omani-Egyptian ties in all fields. President Mubarak's views were
identical to the Omani ones," said Alawi, without disclosing the
content of the message he delivered.
</P>
<P>
Alawi met with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa upon his
arrival here late Monday from the Qatari capital of Doha on an
previously unannounced two-day visit to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Moussa has said Alawi's talks here would deal with a number of
issues including the Gulf affairs, the Arab situation in general
and bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
But diplomatic sources speculated that his current mission is
designed to bridge the growing gap between Cairo and Doha despite
previous mediation efforts by Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
"Calming down the Arab atmosphere was a duty and we have
tackled this subject during the meeting (Tuesday). The issue was
also raised when I was in Doha," Alawi told reporters, without
elaborating.
</P>
<P>
In an indication of no immediate mediation breakthrough, he
said the date of a meeting of the Damascus Declaration Group has
not been set. The meeting slated in Doha was put off after Moussa
said he could not attend on December 1 to 2, 1997, because of the
"tension" between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Damascus Declaration Group, which was formed in the
immediate aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War to develop security and
political links, groups eight countries, namely, Saudi Arabia, the
United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, Syria and
Egypt. They were allied against Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in
1990.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian-Qatari relations deteriorated in October when Egypt
boycotted the fourth Economic Conference of the Middle East and
North Africa in Doha.
</P>
<P>
Qatar introduced a ban on the entry of nationals of Egypt
alongside other nine countries as a security precaution for the
Doha conference, infuriating Cairo and other Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Adding fuel to their row were Qatar's charges that Egypt had
plotted the 1996 coup attempt to overthrow the Gulf sheikdom's
emir. Egypt rejected the charges and demanded for an explanation.
</P>
<P>
The crisis failed to patch up the difference despite intensive
mediation by Saudi Arabia, which facilitated a meeting in the
Saudi capital Riyadh between the Egyptian and Qatari leaders at
the end of November.

<HEADLINE> Flood Worsens in Kenya, Killing Three </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Three youths were drowned,
hundreds of people displaced, and transport and communication were
cut off as heavy rains pounded different parts of Kenya at the
weekend, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Two 15-year-old boys were swept away by swollen River Sosian
near Turbo, Uasin Gishu while the police are still looking for
the body of a 14-year-old boy who was drowned in River Rusumu in
Kakamega, western Kenya.
</P>
<P>
As more bridges and roads continued to be cut off by
landslides, the rains brought by the El Nino weather phenomenon
fell relentlessly, causing flash floods.
</P>
<P>
The situation marred the nationwide schools' opening day
Monday and frustrated travellers in various parts of the eastern
African country as most roads were impassable.
</P>
<P>
Rains which came down in torrents in capital Nairobi Sunday
night made a mess of the transport system, ruining the prospects
of a smooth return-to-school day with hundreds of commuters were
left stranded.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, traffic along the busy Mombasa-Nairobi road was cut
off for several hours following heavy floods which have washed
away Kambu bridge on the road. Mombasa is the country's
second-largest city and coastal capital.
</P>
<P>
Lorries and trucks transporting food, beverages and fuel to
the world-famous Maasai Mara National Park in western Kenya have
been stuck along the muddy Narok-Maasai Mara road for several
days.
</P>
<P>
Hotels, lodges and tented camps which rely on air transport
have been able to receive guests but game drives are impossible.
</P>
<P>
Along the Athi River which burst its banks over the weekend,
hundreds of families were displaced. Frightened residents fled
from their homes with only a few belongings.

<HEADLINE> Barclays Bank in Zambia to Lay off 300 Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Barclays Bank in Zambia will
lay off 300 workers this year as part of the on-going
restructuring program to reduce its staff to 800.
</P>
<P>
The 300 staff will, however, go on voluntary redundancy scheme
set up by the bank three years ago, the local newspaper Financial
Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Iain Knapman, the bank's Managing
Director, as saying that the bank also plans to reduce the number
of expatriates by 40 to 50 percent over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
These are aimed at improving levels of production and meet
customers demands for more efficient service and great product
availability, he said.
</P>
<P>
Restructuring entails clustering branches into one business
unit, a move seen as a catalyst to exploit the bank's growing
information system functionality.
</P>
<P>
"The growing demand for more products, more complex products
and greater operational efficiency calls for specialised skills,
hence the need to use the limited experts through wider
responsibilities across a number of branches within a cluster
than in a single branch" Knapman noted.
</P>
<P>
The bank will retain its in-house training capability and
focus on in-branch training and specialized product-based
courses, he added.

dropped to 241,147 bags (60 kg per bag) in December 1997,
compared with 514,394 bags in the same month the previous year,
Uganda Coffee Development Authority (UCDA) said.
</P>
<P>
The value of coffee export also went down from 35.8 million
U.S. Dollars in December 1996 to 21.6 million Dollars last
December, said the UCDA monthly report.
</P>
<P>
But still, the performance last December is an improvement as
against that of last November which witnessed an export of
179,604 bags and 16.07 million Dollars in earning, the report
noted.
</P>
<P>
UCDA attributed the slight improvement to the increase of
world coffee prices caused in part by the rise in demand and
coffee exporters from 26 in November to 30 in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
The report blamed the reduction in coffee export on heavy
rains which had delayed the collecting of coffee beans and
hindered the drying.
</P>
<P>
Coffee is the most important export item in Uganda which
accounts for 65 percent of country's foreign exchange.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 13 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's Hyundai Motor
Company Tuesday launched its new car model "Santro" in India.
</P>
<P>
The 1000 cc Santro, an upgraded version of "Atos" model, will
hit the roads by October 1998, said Mong Gyu Chung, chairman of
the company here.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai expected to produce 3,000 cars per month to start with.
</P>
<P>
Production will increase to 10,000 cars per month by the end of
1999. Some Santro cars produced in India would be exported to the
neighboring countries, said B. V. R. Subbu, director of sales and
marketing of Hyundai Motor India.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai has already invested 22,000 million rupees (602.74
million US dollars) in its 100 percent Indian subsidiary and would
be investing another 10,000 rupees (270.27 million dollars) before
the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
The recent crisis in South Korea and depreciation of its
currency would not affect Hyundai's investment plans for India,
Mong Gyu Chung said.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Pledges to Take Firm Step to Overcome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
agreed that Indonesia needs to take firm steps along with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) in a bid to build confidence to
the country's economy, an U.S. official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Treasury Secretary of the United States Lawrence Summers
said this when explained his meeting with President Soeharto at
his residence in the morning.
</P>
<P>
Summers, who arrived here on Monday, had a 90-minute discussion
with Soeharto. "President Soeharto and I had a very fruitful
discussion," he said.
</P>
<P>
Appearing to the press for only two minutes, Summers did not
give reporters a chance to ask a single question.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the head of state has pledged that the
Indonesian government would implement the economic reforms as
agreed upon with the IMF.
</P>
<P>
"Our team brings here President Bill Clinton's message about
the importance of economic reforms (in Indonesia)," he said before
taking a car to American Embassy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, after accompanying Soeharto in receiving Summers,
Minister/State Secretary Moerdiono said, "what President Clinton
conveyed (through Summers) are things that had long been in
President Soeharto's mind and (they) will be implemented."
</P>
<P>
Summers, as a special envoy of President Clinton, said here
Monday night after a three-hour meeting with Indonesian Finance
Minister Mar'ie Muhammad that he remained optimistic that
Indonesia's economy will recover.
</P>
<P>
Summers' visit was triggered by recent monetary crisis in
Indonesia. The Indonesian rupiah declined to a historic low of
11,000 per dollar last Thursday. The currency has lost more than
200 percent of its value since July last year.
</P>
<P>
The drastic fall of rupiah has also slowed down the country's
economic activities and threatened businesses with closure and
mass layoff.
</P>
<P>
At the end of October last year, the IMF agreed to provide 23
billion U.S. dollar financial and technical loans to Indonesia in
exchange for conducting economic and financial reforms in the
country.
</P>
<P>
However, the IMF was reportedly dissatisfied over Indonesia's
reforms.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Share prices recovered on the
Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index
rose sharply by 83.05 points to close at 1156.52 points Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers noted that share prices finished higher after seven
straight days of sharp falls in what was termed a technical
rebound.
</P>
<P>
Relative stability in regional currencies and other Asian stock
markets provided investors with the opportunity to hunt for
bargains, they said.
</P>
<P>
However, they added that it remained unclear if the gains were
sustainable. Banking and property shares, which had plunged
recently, led advancers.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume increased to 354.25 million units,
valued at 612.11 million Singapore dollars (343.88 million US
dollars). Advances overwhelmed declines by 313 to 72, while 227
other counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Wing Tai was the most actively traded counter as it registered
a turnover of 31.68 million units. It was followed by Guthrie GTS
which had 26.49 million shares traded. DBS (Development Bank of
Singapore) Land was next with 23.66 million shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
Local computer sound card maker Creative 50 led the gainers of
the day as it rose by 2.1 Singapore dollars to finish at 30.6
Singapore dollars. Khong Guan increased by 1.8 dollars to end at
3.8 Singapore dollars. SPH (Singapore Press Holdings) picked up by
1.7 Singapore dollars to close at 14.2 dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, C Properties was the biggest loser as it
declined by 6.5 dollars to end at 10.5 Singapore dollars. Chem
Ind. fell by 30 cents to close at two Singapore dollars, while
BerLand was 27.5 cents lower at 23 cents.

</P>
<P>
Participants in the conference include World Health
Organisation (WHO), Medical Bureaux of Catholics, Protestants and

<HEADLINE> Williams Beats Hingis in International Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- American black girl Venus
Williams overcame dehydration and cramps to upset world No.1
Martina Hingis in an extraordinary three-set second round match at
the Adidas International Tennis Tournament in Sydney today.
</P>
<P>
Williams took an injury timeout early in the deciding set and
Hingis at 5-5 in the third during a marathon two hour 12 minute
classic played in 29 degrees celsius heat.
</P>
<P>
The world No.32 won 3-6, 6-4, 7-5 on a scorching tennis court
in Sydney to avenge her 1997 US Open final loss to Hingis, the
winner of three Grand Slams last year.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in nearly two years that the defending
champion had lost her opening match of a tournament. She went
down to Japan's Nana Miyagi in three sets at the Lipton
Championship in Florida in March, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Williams, who had failed to win a set in three previous matches
with the Swiss star, said she had never suffered such distress
during a match.
</P>
<P>
"I'd describe it as cramps and heat sickness. I had never had
it before," Williams told the Australian Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to quit, I had come so far in the heat, I knew I
couldn't give up ... I hadn't drunk enough fluid.
</P>
<P>
However, Williams said she was not targeting Hingis' No.1
position this year but admitted it was a goal in future years.
</P>
<P>
Hingis believed she threw away the match after winning the
first set and leading 3-1 in the next but remained defiant.
</P>
<P>
"I should have won this match but she played better, played
smarter".
</P>
<P>
"She made lots of unforced errors in the first set and I took
advantage of that".
</P>
<P>
"I was waiting for her to make mistakes. She didn't make them
after the first set."
</P>
<P>
Williams was level at 1-1 in the third set when her right leg
cramped as she attempted to serve.
</P>
<P>
After treatment courtside and in the change rooms she returned
to massive cheers from the capacity 7,000 crowd.
</P>
<P>
There appeared little hope for the lanky 17-year-old as she
lost three successive points to lose her serve. She barely moved
during that game.
</P>
<P>
But Williams found another gear as she attempted to end each
point quickly with power shots from both sides of the court.
</P>
<P>
She broke Hingis' serve to love to level at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
Then Williams held serve to lead 3-2 before she broke Hingis
for 4-2 and a major upset appeared in the making.
</P>
<P>
Hingis, though, hasn't reached the top without showing
tremendous determination when in trouble, and she crawled out of a
corner to level at 4-4 after breaking back.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss 17-year-old called for an injury timeout two games
later as she suffered mild cramping and heat exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
The time off court helped Williams more than her opponent as
the American converted eight straight points to win the set and
the match.

KUALA LUMPUR, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad met here Tuesday U.S. Congress Finance Committee
Chairman William Roth to discuss on cooperation between Malaysia
and the U.S. to overcome the current economic crisis in Southeast
Asia.
</P>
<P>
"There was a general exchange of views on how the U.S. could
actually help overcome the economic crisis which I cannot reveal,"
Malaysian Foreign Ministry's Undersecretary for Southeast Asia and
South Pacific Division Mohamed Arshad M. Hussain told reporters
after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
However, during their one-hour talk, they did not come out with
specific proposals, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Mahathir explained to Roth the measures Malaysia
was taking to tackle the economic woes and reiterated Malaysia's
refusal to accept International Monetary Fund (IMF) assistance
after Roth told him (Mahathir) that the IMF was there to play a
role should Malaysia need assistance.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. side did not propose any kind of assistance that the
U.S. government could give to Malaysia to deal with the
situation, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir and Roth also discussed the U.S. military presence in
this region and Mahathir stressed that Malaysia did not want an
increased military presence because it would create anxiety
throughout the region, Mohamed Arshad said.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time in the history of Southeast Asia that
things are actually cool and we should not do anything to harm the
civil environment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Roth is here to attend the two-day fourth Pacific Dialogue
which ended here Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> S. African Judicial System to Go Through Radical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 13 (Xinhua) -- South African Justice
Minister Dullah Omar has said that judicial system in the country
will be reformed radically this year.
</P>
<P>
Announcing on Monday, Omar said law students could face a
one-year compulsory internship as part of government's plans for
the comprehensive reform of South African legal aid system.
</P>
<P>
Other measures to enhance access to justice through legal aid
include the use of paralegals for nonlitigation work and a
complete redesign of the legal aid board.
</P>
<P>
Draft legislation due before the cabinet this month will
require lay assessors, drawn from the community, to be used in
all lower court cases. Omar described this as a "very drastic
measure".
</P>
<P>
The assessors, who will receive training, will have an equal
say with the magistrate on granting bail, a guilty or not guilty
verdict and on the sentence.
</P>
<P>
To relieve prison overcrowding, the department will extend
significantly its pretrial services project. This aimed to keep
petty criminal out of prisons and those who posed a threat to
society behind bars.
</P>
<P>
There will not be a mass release of petty criminals, but each
case will be assessed individually by the court.
</P>
<P>
Of the 50,000 awaiting-trial prisoners, about 70 percent had
been granted bail but could not pay it, Omar said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a separation of judicial and administrative
functions will be effected so that courts could concentrate on
their judicial responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
Justice administration will be decentralized through the
creation of nine provincial justice offices.
</P>
<P>
Legislation will review the witness protection
program with a directorate of witness protection being created
with officers in every province, Omar said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Weaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
marginally weaker Tuesday as a falling New Zealand dollar and a
soft gold price thwarted its attempt to push higher.
</P>
<P>
The local unit closed trading at 63.98 US cents, slightly lower
than 64.08 Monday, after starting the session much stronger at
64.36.
</P>
<P>
The market's good mood was ruined by the release of an adverse
International Monetary Fund report on the New Zealand dollar which
knocked the Kiwi lower, taking the Australian dollar with it.
</P>
<P>
A soft gold price also tempered the Australian dollar.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Approves New Foreign Exchange Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has begun a move to
phase out its dual foreign exchange rate regime when most of
government transactions will be carried out according to the
market rate.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Anthony Ani announced on Monday that all
estacode (allowances for officials' foreign trip), travelling
expenses, medical and other bills will be transacted at the rate
of the autonomous foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
But those with the specific approval of the head of state will
continue to enjoy the official rate fixed at one U.S. dollar to
22 Naira, compared to the present market rate of 75 Naira.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, all foreign exchange transactions
carried out by state and local governments, parastatals, oil
mineral producing areas development commission and the petroleum
trust fund shall be conducted at the market rate.
</P>
<P>
However, Ani said transaction pertaining to the transfer of
remittances to embassies abroad, officials of information
ministry residing abroad and other officials performing duties
outside Nigeria would be made at the official rate.
</P>
<P>
The new foreign exchange guidelines which came into effect on
January 10 this year also specified that transactions by the
defense ministry and security agencies as well as items
pertaining to presidential fleet will be remitted at the official
rate.
</P>
<P>
Arms and ammunition and other equipment necessary for the
protection of life and property to be purchased by the police
will be done at the official rate, subject to the approval of the
head of state.
</P>
<P>
Transactions pertaining to the International Football
Federation junior World Cup championship, purchase of outside
broadcasting vans, scoreboards and maintenance of stadia shall be
made at the official rate.
</P>
<P>
The policy equally approved for transactions pertaining to the
funding of Nigeria's external obligations as well as payment for
the modification of the Ajeokuta Steel Complex, the
revitalization of the railway system, X-ray scan equipment for
customs and acquisition of trainer aircraft.
</P>
<P>
With the new arrangement, at least 80 percent of the
government's foreign exchange transaction will be done at the
market rate, according to analysts here.
</P>
<P>
The dual exchange rate system is a sticking point of the
Nigerian government in debt discussions with foreign creditors.
</P>
<P>
It is also one of the key areas which have stopped Nigeria
from getting to even the first step needed to pursue debt
rescheduling, a program agreed with the International Monetary
Fund and World Bank.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that a team of the Bretton Woods Financial
Institutions is expected in Nigeria next month to hold
discussions with officials of the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The fact that only a few Nigerians have access to buying
foreign exchange at the official rate has also aroused fears of
corruption.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Central Bank Denies Foreign Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Zambia has
dismissed reports that a severe shortage of foreign exchange has
hit the country.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia today quoted a spokesman of the Central Bank
as saying here on Monday that demand for foreign exchange at the
end of each year and in the first quarter of the year always tend
to pick up.
</P>
<P>
"This, of course, given the liberalized foreign exchange
market, does put pressure for the foreign exchange rate to
depreciate. However, this cannot be interpreted as a critical
shortage of foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
"The statistics at the Central Bank show that the
international reserves levels are not that different from those
that prevailed during most of 1997," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the foreign currency deposits held by
commercial banks have increased by almost one-third in the last
four months.
</P>
<P>
"The Bank of Zambia would like to appeal to the business
community and the general public holding foreign exchange with
commercial banks to transact at funds freely," he said.
</P>
<P>
Recently a lot of banks in Lusaka have no foreign exchange to
sell.
</P>
<P>
Early this month local newspaper The Post quoted Sam Equamo,
corporate affairs manager of the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines
(ZCCM), as saying that the supply of foreign exchange onto the
market has been constrained by low earnings from copper sales.
</P>
<P>
ZCCM is Zambia's main foreign exchange earner.

<P>
PARIS, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Another black week has opened in Asian stock exchange markets,
with all stock indices, except that of Seoul, falling on Monday. The
shock wave has attained Russia, South America and Europe. Western
officials no longer hide their fear about the financial crisis while
the economic growth in France this year is expected to be affected.
</P>
<P>
-- Newly published military reports written by French officers,
who served in Rwanda as ``military advisors'' until the end of 1993,
clearly show that France fully engaged in the war in Rwanda on the
side of the Hutus against Tutsi rebels in the months which preceded
the 1994 genocide which killed some 800,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The new panic after the stock market crash in Asia on Monday
plunged Europe into torment. The stock exchange index of Hong Kong
and Singapore crashed by falling 8.7 percent, while those of Tokyo
and Bangkok dropped by 2 percent. In Hong Kong, the liquidation of
the Peregrine bank, an establishment emblematic of Asian capitalism,
brought about the fall of the local stocks. Absence of confidence in
the plans to save Asian financial markets also led to a 3.53 percent
fall of the stocks in Frankfurt, 1.35 in London and 1.96 in Paris.
</P>
<P>
-- President Jacques Chirac will meet Tuesday mayors from 12
suburban cities troubled with insecurity and violence. The mayors
will suggest to Chirac a series of measures to curb urban violence,
including a better supervised distribution of aid to poor families,
the isolation of recidivist deliquents, the development of public
projects and the punishment of all offenses.

<HEADLINE> Asian Central Banks Agree on Joint Research on Asian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Asian central banks have
agreed to carry out joint research to overcome the region's
financial crisis, Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim
said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The region's central banks have committed themselves to joint
research to contribute to the systemic health of the regional
economy," Anwar said in his opening remark on the final day of the
two-day Fourth Pacific Dialogue here.
</P>
<P>
Anwar stressed that a common resolve was an imperative and the
global community must act in concert to restore confidence and
rational optimism, warning that unless decisive efforts were taken
to arrest the Asian crisis and the economy was nursed again to
health, the contagion effect would eventually be transmitted to
the global economic system.
</P>
<P>
There is a need for Japan and the United States to step up
their roles in restoring investors' confidence in the prospects of
the Asian economy, Anwar, who is also Malaysia's Finance Minister
and chairman of the two-day dialogue, said.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said the region had agreed on the need for regional
surveillance and macro-economic coordination.
</P>
<P>
He said the current difficulties have taught the countries in
the region that it was in everybody's interest to alert the
regional community of symptoms of systemic instability wherever
and whenever they occurred.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said that the economic crisis confronting the region had
gone beyond mere economics and that unless the situation was
managed wisely and resolved quickly, the social and political
dimensions were going to dominate in the days ahead.
</P>
<P>
"The prospect for the growth of dynamic democracies and civil
society in Asia will grow dimmer," he said.
</P>
<P>
If countries in the region were to get out of the morass, they
must first be honest with themselves and be prepared to take tough
measures that would leave no room for doubt about their political
will to reform, Anwar said.
</P>
<P>
He said the crisis had compelled governments to accept the need
for transparency and the necessity of making adjustments and
instituting reforms no matter how painful. "They (government) must
swallow the bitter pill," he added.
</P>
<P>
He believed the root of the present crisis was really the
region's failure to provide for a truly humane economy.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which was
looked upon as a savior of countries in economic distress, had
not escaped critical scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
"Even those who share the belief that the IMF's role is
fundamental to global economic health now dispute its
prescriptions and the manner in which they are being disputed,"
said Anwar.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said the World Bank, intentionally or not, had
contributed to the crisis by coining the expression the "East Asia
Economic Miracle" which made Asians to be lulled into complacency.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Scientists Discover Signs of Quark Star </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli scientists from the
Weizmann Institute have discovered signs of the existence of a
star in our galaxy that is made from compressed quarks, The
Jerusalem Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This new "strange star," if finally identified, will confirm
the existence of a new class of celestial bodies that Professor
Edward Witten of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton,
New Jersey of the United States, predicted nearly 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Its crucial component is the "strange quark" - one of six
types of quarks, which are the tiniest building blocks of
matter. In published researchs in the past two years, Professor
Vladimir Usov of Weiamann Institute's Condensed Matter Physics
Department has outlined all three characteristics that could
enable astronomers finally to identify examples of "strange
stars."
</P>
<P>
"Only a handful of the heaven bodies observed in our galaxy
are probably 'strange stars', but they would constitute a totally
new class of celestial objects with extraordinary properties," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The three unique features he set down would distinguish them
from the more common neutron star, even though both look very
similar. Usov said there are nearly 1,000 neutron stars in the
earth's galaxy, and about one percent may be "strange stars," so
may be some of the 20 or so enigmatic bodies that astronomers
think are "black holes."
</P>
<P>
If "strange stars" are positively identified by Usov's
criteria, this would finally settle a major dispute in particle
physics on the existence of matter composed of quarks - the most
stable matter in the universe, the report said.
</P>
<P>
But quarks rarely exist as separate entities, and it's
possible to get only a brief glimpse of their existence in
high-energy particle accelerators. So "strange stars' would offer
scientists their only chance to observe a large and stable piece
of quark matter, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Usov used theoretical calculations to identify the three
unique behaviors of these stars: the energy of x-rays emitted by
a "strange star" is 10 to 100 times greater than that emitted by
a neutron star; these x-rays are fired in pulses from a "strange
star"; and the "strange star" contains a small amount of
electrons in addition to the quarks, creating a very strong
electrical field over its surface.
</P>
<P>
Usov said that one likely candidate for a "strange star" is
located near the center of the galaxy and believed by many to be
a black hole. But, because it meets all his three criteria, he
believes it could be a "strange star."

Being labelled a "narrow but over-populated" land, the northern
provinces in the past were barely self-sufficient in food.
</P>
<P>
Each year, the north had to import up to one million tonnes of
paddy equivalent to 500,000 tonnes of rice from the Mekong delta,
Vietnam's largest "rice basket".
</P>
<P>
With the agricultural economy restructured, the northern
provinces are heading towards export-oriented production.

<TEXT>
<P>
PERTH, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Olympic platform diving champion
Dmitri Sautin beat Chinese Zhou Yilin convincingly as he got an
outstanding total of 746.79 points at the men's 3m springboard
final at the world swimming championships here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian star scored over 93 points apiece in his fourth and
fifth dives, running away from the rest of the field. It was the
fifth gold medal won by Russia in the championships.
</P>
<P>
Zhou, currently China's best springboard diver, scored 694.92
points for the silver medal, with Russian Vassiliy Lisovskiy
getting the bronze in 651.60.
</P>
<P>
The gap of 51.87 was the biggest ever between Sautin and Zhou
and it signaled China had lost its dominance over the men's
springboard event.
</P>
<P>
Zhou, who last year won six international springboard titles in
absence of Sautin, had lost both of his two encounters with the
Russian.
</P>
<P>
Sautin edged Zhou by 6.9 points in the U.S. Grand Prix last May
and won over the Chinese again by a thin margin of 0.96 points in
the World Cup last October.
</P>
<P>
"Sautin dived far better than me," said Zhou. "He has very
strong mentality and consistency."

<HEADLINE> Tehran Attacks Washington for Accusations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Tehran has strongly attacked the
United States for its "repeat accusations" against Iran, saying
that they would only strengthen the wall of mistrust between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi Monday night
lashed out at the Monday remarks of the U.S. national security
advisor Sandy Berger that Iran poses a threat to the region
considering its policies on terrorism, the Mideast peace and
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Quoted by the Iranian official news agency IRNA Tuesday, the
spokesman said "what the American politicians repeat about Iran
are allegations."
</P>
<P>
"As long as the American Administration does not change its
behavior towards the Islamic Republic and continues to repeat its
routine allegations against Tehran, the bulky wall of mistrust
between Tehran and Washington will continue to exist," Mohammadi
said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed regret that certain U.S. political officials and
media have interpreted the recent statements of Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami on relations with the U.S. to their own interests.
</P>
<P>
In his first interview with the Cable News Network (CNN) aired
on Thursday, Khatami called for people-to-people cultural dialog
instead of the government-to-government talks as reported by some
U.S. newspapers.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Iran "feels no need to have diplomatic ties
with the U.S." since Washington has not changed its policies
towards Iran.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said Khatami "while emphasizing the dignity and the
might of the Islamic Republic, outlined Iran's rightful stance
and also enumerated the sufferings and pain that the Iranian
nation has endured over many years because of the unfair policies
of the U.S.."
</P>
<P>
The message of Khatami was that Iran will never compromise over
its independence and will not drop its principled stances in the
face of foreign pressure, Mohammadi said.

<HEADLINE> Israel's 1997 Trade Deficit Shrinks Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Israel's 1997 trade deficit
decreased by 23.8 percent over that of the previous year, standing
at 7.894 billion U.S. dollars, The Jerusalem Post reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the data, published Monday by Israeli Central
Bureau of Statistics, as saying that the 1997 imports fell by 3.2
percent to 28.631 billion dollars, while exports increased by 7.7
percent to 20.737 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The decline in imports is the largest since 1985. And the key
declines were in imports of raw materials, investment goods and
consumer products, which indicated a slowdown of Israel's
economy in 1997, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel's industrial exports increased by about 16
percent in the high-tech field last year, particularly in
electronics, communications equipment, machinery and supervisory
products.
</P>
<P>
The data also show that Israel now exports more to the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) than to Britain or Germany,
making the PNA the second only after the United States in terms of
exports.
</P>
<P>
The PNA imported some 1.57 billion dollars worth of goods from
Israel last year. Most of the imports were funded by grants and
loans from other countries as well as export earnings and income
from Palestinians working in Israel.

<HEADLINE> Interior Minister: New Stage of Crimes Faces Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Russia is facing a new
stage of organized criminal activities, Russian Interior
Minister Anatoly Kulikov warned on Tuesday, according to
Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the daily Rossiiskiye Vesti,
Kulikov, also Russia's deputy prime minsiter, said although
there is some statistics about a decrease in registered
crimes, experts of the ministry predict a surge of criminal
activities in the near future.
</P>
<P>
"This forecast is backed by the growing number of grave
offenses," the interior minister said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the numbers of bandit assaults at
money-storing facilities, apartment thefts and premeditated
murders are on the rise.
</P>
<P>
"More than one thousand kidnapping cases and 20,000
crimes involving firearms were registered last year. And all this
is just an outward manifestation of the deeply hidden criminal
processs", Kulikov said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the criminal interests now focused on
the process of the transformation of state ownership.
In Kulikov's view, the contributing factors to the
criminal activities are the speedy privatization, and the
inefficient laws.
</P>
<P>
The minister believed that organized crime can be
effectively crashed only by the concerted effort of all
law-enforcement agencies, local and regional authorities,
lawmakers and ordinary citizens.

<HEADLINE> EU Bans Fish Imports from East Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
clamped an emergency ban on fish imports from Kenya, Uganda and
Tanzania, the East African Standard newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
EU sources attributed the move to health concerns raised over
the prevalence of the cholera epidemic in the three eastern
African countries all bordering on Lake Victoria, the second
largest fresh water lake in the world, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Bernard Ryelandt, a senior EU official, was quoted as saying
in Kampala that the ban came into effect on December 23, 1997,
and is expected to be reviewed by the end of February, depending
on the magnitude of the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
The sanction, which also affected cholera-hit Mozambique, will
be restricted to fresh fish exports, he said, adding frozen and
processed fish products will first undergo cholera tests upon
arrival in Europe at the expense of the exporters, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ban followed a visit to the region by EU health inspectors
during the first three weeks of December.
</P>
<P>
The cholera outbreak caused by heavy rains, has claimed over
1,000 lives since November in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Ryelandt said the EU has asked the three east African
countries to meet the EU's set quality standards in fish exports
up to June, otherwise, their fish will be permanently banned from
Europe.
</P>
<P>
The EU has repeatedly warned the three states to upgrade
sanitary operation for fish destined to Europe, charging that
fish from the region has a high level of bacteria infections due
to poor handling.
</P>
<P>
EU inspectors visiting east Africa in May last year said that
airports there lacked cold storage facilities suitable for fish
while landing sites also lacked sanitary facilities.
</P>
<P>
The EU is ready to help the three countries in upgrading
sanitary facilities, provided they present their budgets in time
to escape the June deadline, Ryelandt said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Woeful Year for Thailand's Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Investors on the Stock Exchange
of Thailand (SET) were simply unable to take a breath of relief
last year as the SET index kept falling almost all year round.
</P>
<P>
The SET index fell 55.18 percent in the entire 1997, reflecting
the extent of the country's macroeconomic slump, the turmoil in
the financial sector and the collapse of the baht.
</P>
<P>
The year 1997 began with the SET opening at 831.57 points, and
closing at 372.69 points, losing 458.88 points, or a staggering
55.18 percent.
</P>
<P>
The SET index peaked for the year on January 22, at 858.97
points, and the low came on December 26, when the market closed at
357.13.
</P>
<P>
The total trade on the market last year was worth about 930
billion baht, equal to an average daily turnover of 3.76 billion
baht, a stark drop from the 1996 total volume of 1,300 billion
baht, or 5.34 billion baht per day.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors' transactions accounted for 43.31 percent of
the total trading value last year, worth 805 billion baht.
</P>
<P>
In the year, SET regulators initiated several changes to
bolster supervision and monitoring systems, internal control and
risk management among listed members.
</P>
<P>
A major change was the raising of trading ceiling and floor
prices on the main board by 10 percent to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
A "circuit-breaker" system was also introduced to slow trading
in times of high volatility. Under this system, if the index drops
more than 100 percent from the pervious day's close, trading is
halted for one hour, and a drop of more than 200 percent will see
the market closed for the rest of the day.
</P>
<P>
Regulations were also made to improve the quality of listed
firms. Relaxed listing requirements for provincial companies were
eliminated, and only firms with established track records could be
accepted. Minimum capital and financial performance requirements
for new applicants were also raised.
</P>
<P>
In spite of these changes, a 17.2 billion U.S. dollar bailout
package arranged by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and a
more popular Democrats-led coalition government, which came to
office in early November, investors' confidence did not see any
improvement late last year or early this year.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the SET index has kept last year's falling
trend, losing another 33.52 points, or 9 percent in just six
trading days from the 1997 year-end level.
</P>
<P>
The SET index kept its steady slide in 1997 along with the
baht, which has suffered a de factor devaluation since its
floating on July 2, from 25.79 baht per U.S. dollar on the eve of
the floating to 47.286 baht at year-end, losing 83.35 percent of
its value in only six months.
</P>
<P>
Other factors which had adverse impact on the SET include the
suspension by the government of 58 ailing finance companies, of
which 56 were subsequently closed down in December, and the
monetary crises in other countries in Asia, such as those in the
Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
On Monday the baht again hit an all-time low, closing at 56.40
baht to the U.S. dollar in local market, and at 56.10 baht in
foreign market.
</P>
<P>
It means that with 56.10 baht, which are now worth one U.S.
dollar, a buyer could have got 2.175 dollars before the floating.
</P>
<P>
It seems certain that with the various adverse factors in the
country and the region, the free fall of the SET index and the
baht will continue.
</P>
<P>
One worrying element is the strict austerity conditions set by
the IMF when it offered its bailout program for Thailand in August
1997.
</P>
<P>
High interest rates, increased taxes and low government
spending, as required by the IMF for Thailand's right to draw
money from the program, will now do more harm than good to the
Thai economy, following the wide-spread monetary turmoil across
East and Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government has decided to negotiate with the IMF later
this month for better terms under changed circumstances, and it
has also called for financial assistance from the United States
and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Without a halt in the regional financial crisis and more
assistance from the international community, the Thai economy,
including the SET and the baht, will get worse before it gets
better, with a possible bottoming out toward the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> Asian Banks Urged to Check Currency Volatility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Asian central banks should
consider establishing a fund to check currency fluctuations in the
region, American International Group, Inc. (AIG) chairman and
chief executive officer Maurice Greenberg said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"What I'm talking about is a fund that regional central banks
can use to moderate excessive currency fluctuations," he told
reporters on the sidelines of the two-day Fourth Pacific Dialogue
which ended here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Greenberg, who attended the dialogue, described attacks on
currencies as "very destructive" and said they must be blunted to
prevent them from wrecking any country's currency.
</P>
<P>
"It's one thing that free market should flourish but you also
have to prevent the type of attacks that can be very destructive,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Speculative attacks on regional currencies such as the Thai
baht, the Indonesian rupiah, the Malaysian ringgit and the Korean
won have resulted in the significant depreciation of these
currencies against the U.S. dollar, causing the region to suffer
its worst economic and financial turmoil since last July.
</P>
<P>
Greenberg was of the view that the assistance of the
International Monetary Fund, which has given aid to Indonesia,
Thailand and South Korea, should be sought as a last resort.
</P>
<P>
AIG, an American insurance conglomerate, will announce details
of its new infrastructure fund of about 2 billion U.S. dollars
Wednesday in Singapore for investments throughout the region,
Greenberg said.

<HEADLINE> Official: Quake Victims Protected from Cold, Hunger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, January 13 (Xinhua) -- People in Zhangjiakou
received disaster relief goods and funds soon after a strong quake
jolted the area on Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Wan Fang, head of the Hebei Provincial
Anti-Quake and Disaster Relief Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
He said, though the temperature of quake-hit areas at night
reached 20 degrees below zero Centigrade, a large number of
cotton-padded overcoats, quilts and food rushed to the area have
solved the basic needs of people in the quake-damaged areas.
</P>
<P>
Wan said the provincial government held four meetings in a day
after the quake measuring 6.2 on the Richter scale hit the area at
noon on Saturday. Ten trucks loaded with overcoats, quilts, tents
and food arrived at the quake-hit areas that evening.
</P>
<P>
Wan added that 13 medical teams rushed to the area soon after
the quake.
</P>
<P>
By Jan. 12 the quake-hit area had received 13.4 million yuan in
relief funds, 47,000 cotton-padded coats, 73,000 quilts, 618,000
kilograms of fast food, and large amount of heating materials and
cooking facilities.
</P>
<P>
Though the tents and make-shift shelters are not as warm as
ordinary houses, he said, people there have enough fuel to keep
the temporary living places safe from the cold.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Xinhua reporters in Zhangbei said
People's Liberation Army troops and rescue workers are speeding up
the installation of tents and make-shift shelters.
</P>
<P>
When they toured several villages in Zhangbei Monday night, the
two reporters heard snoring sounds coming from the make-shift
shelters.
</P>
<P>
In a tent hospital in Dahe Township, a woman gave birth to a
baby girl just one day after the quake. Another pregnant woman
approaching her expected date of childbirth is awaiting the birth
of her baby at the hospital bed.
</P>
<P>
Just two weeks before China's lunar calendar new year,
8-year-old Zhao Xiuping told Xinhua that she was rescued from her
collapsed house one day after the shock. Her wish is to have a
pair of new shoes for the coming of Spring Festival, China's most
important holiday celebration.

MOSCOW, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The aim of the Russian foreign
policy is and will continue to be the protection of national
interests without sliding down to confrontation, Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
In an article "Integration Processes -- Main Road For

foreign minister said the diversification of Russia's foreign
political activities proved to be effective, and the course chosen
proved to be correct.
</P>
<P>
Primakov believed that Russia's membership of the Group of
Eight was one of the main accomplishments of its foreign policy in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Russia has also made headway in developing relations with the
Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), and it is soon to
be admitted to the Asia-Pacific Economic Community, he added.
</P>
<P>
An agreement on partnership with the European Union has come
into force, Primakov continued. Russia has taken part in 17
peace-keeping operations, which showed the role played by Russia
on a global level.
</P>
<P>
"We have a real forecast saying that the world is moving
towards a multi-polar structure," Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
On relations with the United States, the minister said, "The
rapprochement of our positions with those of the United States is
going on on the basis of equality, mutual protection and the
recognition of the right of each of the parties to protect its
interests, but without sliding down to confrontation."
</P>
<P>
In the article, Primakov also stressed the development in
consolidating relations within the Commonwealth of Independent
States, in particular with Belarus and Ukraine.

<HEADLINE> AIG to Announce Investment Fund for Southeast Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The American International
Group, Inc. (AIG), an American insurance conglomerate, will
announce details of its new infrastructure fund of about 2 billion
U.S. dollars Wednesday for investments throughout Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
This reflects the company's confidence in the future of this
region despite the current economic woes, AIG chairman and chief
executive officer Maurice Greenberg said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He added that the announcement will be made in Singapore
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are working on a number of new investment programs in many
fields for the region including Malaysia," he told reporters on
the sidelines of the two-day Fourth Pacific Dialogue which ended
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Greenberg is a member of the American delegation to the
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The allocation of the fund would depend on the nature of
projects and how they are structured among others, he said, adding
that AIG plans to invest more in areas such as the securities
market and infrastructure development.
</P>
<P>
"We are even considering locating some of our units in Malaysia
as well as other parts of the region," he said, noting that Asia
needs selective infrastructure development to continue its
economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Down in Kenya Despite Election Fever </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's inflation rate
continued to drop in December, reflecting a sustained economic
stability although election fever culminated in at that time.
</P>
<P>
The three-months annualized inflation eased to 2.7 percent in
December from 5.5 percent in November, according to the January
edition of the Monthly Economic Review issued by the Central Bank
of Kenya (CBK).
</P>
<P>
While, the average annual inflation marginally fell to 11.2
percent from 11.4 percent over the same period.
</P>
<P>
The overall month-on-month inflation stood at 8.3 percent in
December, almost the same level as that recorded in November,
said the review.
</P>
<P>
The underlying inflation also eased, with the three-month
annualized inflation dropping to 6.2 percent in December from
10.8 percent in November, while the underlying average annual
inflation eased to 6.6 percent from 7.1 percent during the
period.
</P>
<P>
The decline is largely due to a slower expansion of broad
money supply than in the past and the relatively stable Shilling
exchange rate last month, said the review.
</P>
<P>
"A significant factor behind the decline in inflation was the
sustained slower expansion in money supply that restrained
aggregate demand to levels consistent with the anticipated GDP
growth in 1997," said the review.
</P>
<P>
"The less volatile exchange rate in the month also helped to
contain the inflationary pressures implicit in imports and in
consumer items such as health, clothing and footwear," it said.
</P>
<P>
However, the underlying month-on-month inflation edged up to
5.4 percent in December compared with 5.3 percent in the previous
month. Underlying inflation excludes "transitory" factors which
are affect inflation on a short term.
</P>
<P>
The review also predicted that the declining trend in
inflation is to continue in the months ahead because appropriate
macro economic policies are in place, in addition to the expected
restoration of investors' confidence in Kenya's economy.
</P>
<P>
"To enhance the effectiveness of tight monetary policy on
inflation, a more restrained fiscal policy should be pursued.
The fiscal policy should ensure that the budget deficit does
not exceed 1.7 percent of GDP by the end of 1997/98," it noted.
</P>
<P>
"This requires the government revenue collection system to be
strengthened further," said the review.

<HEADLINE> Studying Public's Awareness of Science in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Although most Chinese respect
scientists, the general public's knowledge of science remains
quite low, according to a recent study.
</P>
<P>
It showed that scientists are among the most respected people
in China, ahead of doctors and government officials, and that 44.4
percent of those who responded want their children to become
scientists.
</P>
<P>
The study, which covered 29 provinces, municipalities and
autonomous regions, was done by the China Association for Science
and Technology, the State Science and Technology Commission, and
the Institute of Chinese Popular Science.
</P>
<P>
This respect for scientists does not, however, help the public
in their knowledge of science, says Li Daguang of the Institute of
Chinese Popular Science.
</P>
<P>
The study also contained some basic questions about physics,
biology, medicine, and geography, closely related to people's
daily lives, and the results, when compared with a similar survey
in the United States, were poor for most of the questions.
</P>
<P>
However, 65.7 percent of those responding think that man
evolved from the anthropoid ape, a greater number than for their
American counterparts, and this shows a big cultural difference
between China and the western countries, according to Li.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of those surveyed said that they are concerned
about environmental problems, but only 10.5 percent know that the
major hole of the ozone layer is over the South Pole, and 49.8
percent seemed unaware of the causes of ozone depletion.
</P>
<P>
Chinese show as much interest as Americans in new scientific
developments, but only 24.8 percent of the Chinese are interested
in developments in medical science, compared with 69 percent in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that about 78 percent of the Chinese
haven't visited museums or scientific and technological
exhibitions in the past year.
</P>
<P>
Li said that males performed better than females, and that the
higher the education level of the respondent, the higher his or
her scientific awareness.
</P>
<P>
"So increasing education is the only way to increase public
scientific awareness," he concludes.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Build Double-dipping Tirecord Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 13 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will start
building a double-dipping tirecord plant in Port Elizabeth next
month.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the building of the new 45-million Rand
(nine million U.S. Dollars) plant, to be called Industryre, the
first ever in southern Africa, was made Monday by Francois de
Selliers, Managing Director of Industex, South Africa's largest
technical textile manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
It is generally believed a good news for locgl tyre
manufacturers which have had to import double-dipped fabric which
forces them to be less competitive, cost wise, on the export
market.
</P>
<P>
Once up and running, the plant will produce 100 meters of
dipped tirecord a minute, a capacity of at least 15,000 tons per
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The new plant will create approximately 130 jobs by year 2002
with the construction of the unit taking approximately 15 months.
This number of jobs could increase to over 200 by 2005 if the
venture is as successful as foreseen.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the new dipping complex plant is due to start
next month and first production should begin by March or April
next year.
</P>
<P>
At present the three Port Elizabeth-based tyre companies have
single dipping facilities. Industyre's dipping plant would
provide higher quality material at a cheaper price than fabric
presently imported.

<HEADLINE> 300,000 People Need Food Aid in S. Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 13 (Xinhua) -- More than 300,000 people in
Masvingo province in southern Zimbabwe are desperate for food aid
and had by last Friday registered for help with their respective
district administrators.
</P>
<P>
Alphonse Chikurira, Provincial Administrator for Masvingo,
said on Monday 301,000 people had applied for relief food under
the government's grain loan scheme.
</P>
<P>
This means one in every four people in this drought-prone
province with 1.2 million population, is now in a dire situation,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
According to Chikurira, district administrators in the
southeastern province were still processing more applications.
</P>
<P>
The number of those in need of relief food is expected to rise
to 350,000 soon due to the continued decline in food reserves in
the province.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more people countrywide are expected to apply for
food aid this year because of the predicted drought.
</P>
<P>
But the government has assured the nation that nobody will die
from hunger as it had enough maize.

<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
met here today with a U.S. delegation from Minnesota state led by
its governor, Arne Carlson.
</P>
<P>
Jiang extended a warm welcome to the delegation, saying that
China and Minnesota have a history of long-term friendship.
</P>
<P>
During recent years Minnesota has actively carried out economic
and trade cooperation with China and, so far, many corporations of
the state have opened their business here, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president pointed out that the economies of China and the
United States are highly complementary, and his U.S. visit last
fall created new opportunities for bilateral economic and trade
cooperation while stimulating steady progress in overall bilateral
ties.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Minnesota would expand its
cooperation with the central and western regions of China to
contribute more to the development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Carlson said that Minnesota has maintained long-term friendly
cooperation with China. The state is willing to give full play to
its advantages in such sectors as agriculture, commerce and
electronics, and to further increase their cooperation with China
in these fields.
</P>
<P>
The delegation arrived in Beijing Sunday at the invitation of
the China Council for the Promotion of International
Trade.

Bill Clinton reached agreement on jointly building a constructive
strategic partnership oriented toward the 21st century between
China and the United States.
</P>
<P>
This is a major contribution to world peace, stability and
prosperity in the new century, Zhang said, adding that it also
marked a new phase of development in Sino-U.S. ties.
</P>
<P>
Zhang told his U.S. visitors that Taiwan is the most important
and sensitive issue affecting the healthy development of
Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral ties would stablize and advance if the Taiwan issue
can be properly settled, Zhang said. Otherwise, ties could be
harmed and even go backwards, he added.
</P>
<P>
Zhang expressed his hope that the United States would abide
conscientiously by the principles enshrined in the three
Sino-U.S. joint communiques and deal with the Taiwan issue in a
proper way.
</P>
<P>
Zhang also briefed the U.S. guests on China's domestic
situation.
</P>
<P>
Perry said that maintaining a strategic partnership between the
two sides is crucial to improving regional security and stability.
</P>
<P>
The two sides can handle the existing problems between the two
countries through constructive and positive consultation, Perry
said, in hopes that the relations between the two countries and
the military-to-military relations can move forward in a healthy
and stable way.
</P>
<P>
Perry showed concern to the people in north China's Hebei
Province struck by a severe earthquake and aftershocks, and spoke
highly of the timely and positive efforts of the Chinese People's
Liberation Army in providing disaster relief.

<HEADLINE> Australian Tourism to Double Despite Asia Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Australian Acting Prime
Minister Tim Fischer said Tuesday that he is confident the number
of overseas visitors to Australia will double despite an Asian
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
"And whilst yes, numbers from Korea and other places are
dropping, that does not mean there's not a great capability to
attract eco-tourists and other tourists from other parts of the
world," Fischer told journalists in the northern state of New
South Wales.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Associated Press quoted Fischer as saying at the
World Heritage Rainforest Center, which he opened in the state,
that attractions such as rainforests and other forms of
eco-tourism would help counteract the loss of tourists to more
traditional tourist centers visited by Asians.
</P>
<P>
"There is a growing market for eco-tourism of which I think
we've only just begun to scratch the potential," Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
"The tourism industry is not immune to the tougher market
conditions for inbound Asian tourists," he said.
</P>
<P>
"That does not mean that there's not a bold future for the
tourist industry," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said 11 of the globe's 400 world heritage areas in Australia
and eco-tourism offer the country an opportunity to maximize its
competitive advantage growing on the natural features and the
unique flora and fauna.
</P>
<P>
The devaluation of the Australian dollar against the U.S.
dollar also makes tour in Australia cheaper for tourists from
North America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Australia expects tourists from the United States, Europe and
China would increase and thus counteract the loss of tourists from
Japan, Korea and some other Asian countries.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Human Rights Body Opposes Trial of French </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Islamic Human Rights
Commission (IHCR) has announced its support for a French author,
who is on trial for his controversial book on Israel as Tehran
radio reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This stance of IHCR came in a message to Roger Garaudi, a
French professor and philosopher, the author of the book "Les
Mythes Fondeteurs de la Politique Israelienne" (Founding Myths of
Israeli Politics), published in 1996.
</P>
<P>
He has been on trial since last Thursday in Paris for denying
the existence of gas chambers for the extermination of Jews in
World War II in the book. He also said that the extermination of 6
million Jews during the war by the Nazis is a myth used to justify
everything Israel has demanded and obtained from Palestine,
according to the radio report.
</P>
<P>
In the message sent to Garaudi Monday, the IHRC said that the
trial is bringing freedom of speech and thought to trial.
</P>
<P>
The commission noted that the trial of Garaudi is a
demonstration of disrespect and non-conformity to the practice of
freedom of speech in association with a scholar who intends to
make public his research works.
</P>
<P>
Iran does not recognize the Israeli government for Israel's
occupation of Arab land, particularly Jerusalem, a place
considered as one of the holiest sites for the Muslims.
</P>
<P>
The IHRC was established in 1995 with an aim to defend the
Iranian authorities over human rights issues. The commission has
repeatedly rejected Western accusation of Iran's human rights
abuses.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- France hopes to increase its
cooperation with China in tourism, according to Michelle
Demessine, France's secretary of state in charge of tourism to the
Ministry of Equipment, Transport and Tourism.
</P>
<P>
Demessine, who started her visit on Jan. 10 at the invitation
of the China National Tourism Administration, said at a news
briefing here today that the purpose of her visit is to facilitate
exchanges between the two countries' tourism administrations.
</P>
<P>
She added that the exchange of experience between the two
countries' enterprises and tourism departments will enable more
visitors to visit each other.
</P>
<P>
She said that entrepreneurs accompanying her on the visit are
interested in investing in China's tourism industry and looking
forward to more relevant information.
</P>
<P>
Demessine pointed to the fact that France and China signed an
"encouraging" accord on tourism cooperation Monday.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral cooperation on tourism infrastructure is promising,
she added.
</P>
<P>
She said that she will also travel to Shanghai and Xi'an, where
she will discuss with local officials cooperation on the tourism
sector.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Denies Scrapping Plane Purchase Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Airlines, the
country's flag carrier, Tuesday denied reports that it has
canceled the purchase of four Boeing planes due to the currency
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Avelina Zapanta, PAL senior vice president for sales and
services, said that the company is expecting four Boeing planes to
be delivered within the year while the remaining four should come
by 1999.
</P>
<P>
Zapanta noted that the near completion of its 4 billion U.S.
dollars modernization program with the delivery of the eight
Boeing 747s by late 1999.
</P>
<P>
Despite the grave currency situation, PAL had coped well with
the lingering crisis, Zapanta said.
</P>
<P>
"The crisis has not had much effect on the once-beleaguered
airline because 80 percent of its reserves come from international
operations, we are definitely hedged against the currency
depreciation," Zapanta said.
</P>
<P>
The impact, however, would be on PAL's foreign debt, he said.
</P>
<P>
To finance its expansion, PAL used offshore borrowings which
prior to the peso devaluation entailed lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Zapanta said the 70 percent fall of the peso against the dollar
has raised PAL's costs by 10 to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
The airlines' modernization program calls for 36 new aircraft
-- 28 from Airbus Industrie in France and eight from the
Seattle-based Boeing. The program aims to arm PAL with the
youngest fleet among Asian carriers, Zapanta said.

<HEADLINE> More Quake Victims Move into Tents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHANGBEI (Hebei), January 13 (Xinhua) -- "I was playing outside
when my house suddenly collapsed with a loud crash," recalled
13-year-old Wu Tianjiang, waiting in line Tuesday for a relief
cotton-padded overcoat and a cotton blanket.
</P>
<P>
Wu lives in Luanshishan Village, Dahe Township, one of the most
badly stricken villages by Saturday's earthquake in Zhangbei and
Shangyi counties of north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
"I'm dreaming of a home so that my parents and I can have a
sweet sleep," said Wu, exhausted after having no comfortable sleep
for three nights.
</P>
<P>
A small shed coated with cotton quilts became the shelter for
the Wu family since the Jan. 10 earthquake. The four-member family
has to keep warm by a stove at the shed's entry.
</P>
<P>
The other 70 families in Luanshishan Village have been leading
similar lives these days. Some villagers who did not have sheds
are sharing with neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Several severely damaged villages in Zhangbei County are nearly
1,600 meters above sea level. Night-time temperatures are often 20
degrees below zero Centigrade.
</P>
<P>
"Heaven is quite cooperative these days," said Gao Ying from
Wenshulugou Village of Dahe Township. "The temperature could drop
to minus 27 to 28 degrees at night in former years." Gao was
worried that possible snowfall would make things worse.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers from the Beijing Military Area Command are helping
villagers build cotton tents. The 1.5-meter-thick frozen ground
makes digging very difficult, said Commander Liu Jie. But he said
that soldiers would work harder to ensure that more villagers
could move into tents. Liu's company had finished putting up 10
cotton tents in half a day.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 military cotton tents have been pitched for
villagers in Dahe Township with each tent sheltering 25
people. More than 1,600 similar tents have been transported to
Zhangbei County, with more on the way.

<HEADLINE> Recession Said to Hit Australia in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Australia faces a blowout in
interest rates and unemployment and an economic recession at the
start of the next century as a result of the Asian meltdown, the
country's major economic forecaster warned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
There is little Australia could do to avoid being dragged down
by the Asian turmoil, the National Institute of Economic and
Industry Research told the Australian Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
The institute, Australia's largest independent economic
forecaster, said there is little hope of avoiding an economic
downturn in 2000 and 2001.
</P>
<P>
"The real concern is what will happen around 2000. The crisis
has still got a long way to go (and) a lot of the problems are
beyond Australia's policy control," said Tim Toohey, the
institute's senior economist.
</P>
<P>
Toohey's comments are in contrast to beliefs that Australia's
strong domestic demand would provide a buffer against the Asian
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that as Australia's international trade
position weakens, the current extremely low interest rates are
likely to almost double, leaving a significant portion of the
population laboring under a large amount of debt.
</P>
<P>
More personal debt would mean less spending, causing companies
to lay off staff and increasing unemployment to above 11 percent
by 2002 from the current 8.5 percent, Toohey predicted.
</P>
<P>
He said a slowdown in western economies after year 2000 has
been on the cards for several years, but would be severely
exacerbated if Asian economies do not quickly deregulate and
reorganize themselves.
</P>
<P>
But he recommended that Australia continue to encourage reform
and deregulation in Asian economies, avoid subsidizing faltering
companies, and fight the systemic corruption in many Asian
economies.
</P>
<P>
The situation would also be affected by changes in the U.S. and
Chinese economies.

<HEADLINE> New Tourism Programs Offered to Visitors to Guilin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- To attract more Chinese and
overseas visitors to Guilin, a leading scenic site in the country,
a series of new historical and cultural sites and facilities have
been repaired in the city.
</P>
<P>
The famous resort city of Guilin, located in southwest China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, reputedly has the "most
beautiful rivers and mountains in the world."
</P>
<P>
The 1998 tourism program will offer opportunities to share not
only the Guilin's picturesque natural scenery with visitors, but
also the idyllic countryside, said Huang Jiacheng, director of the
city's tourism bureau.
</P>
<P>
Huang said the city receives more than 400,000 overseas
tourists and 10 million domestic visitors every year due to
improvements in tourism facilities and transportation.
</P>
<P>
This year Guilin will sponsor several important outdoor
activities such as rafting along the scenic Lijiang River during
the summer-autumn period, cycling and hiking.
</P>
<P>
The city also will provide a series of traditional and new
scenic spots such as the Jingjiang Mausoleum and Miao and Yao
villages as well as nine major tourism routes.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Sends Novel New Year's Greetings to Workers in Need </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 13 (Xinhua) -- You Jianmin, a 44-year-old
employee of a Shanghai electronics company, was moved to tears,
when local trade union officials handed her relief funds with
their new year's greetings.
</P>
<P>
You suffers from epilepsy and her husband has a disability as
well, but fortunately the couple were one of several hundred
families in need of financial aid that officials of the Shanghai
Trade Union Council, led by President Bao Xinbao, hadn't
forgotten.
</P>
<P>
The group sent them holiday greetings along with the money,
around New Year's Day. The Shanghai municipal government plans to
spend 90 million yuan on these workers around New Year's Day and
Spring Festival this year.
</P>
<P>
A number of Shanghai's workers are in similar straits. In
addition to those in poor health or with heavy family burdens,
there are those laid off because of problems in the factory.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, the municipality has worked to maintain a minimum
wage and living standard that guarantees the basic needs of its
residents, and even has a computer network that covers 500,000 of
these people.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the authorities provide grain and edible oil at a
low cost and stipends for students in need. Each holiday, local
officials, from municipal leaders to factory heads, go to the
homes of needy workers and extend their greetings. Last year,
officials in Shanghai visited 500,000 households.
</P>
<P>
Poverty-relief funds and charitable foundations are the main
source of help for needy families. These organizations now have in
excess of 400 million yuan, which comes from government
allocations, the service industry, and individual donations.
</P>
<P>
Various other groups in Shanghai have also begun to join the
aid-the-poor effort. Some 15 local hospitals began providing
medical cards for people in need last year, offering them free
medical care.

<HEADLINE> Qaidam Basin Playing Major Role in China's Oil Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Qaidam Basin oilfield in
northwest China's Qinghai province produced 1.6 million tons of
oil in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Qaidam Basin on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau has 4.2 billion
tons of proven reserves, according to a provincial petroleum
administration official.
</P>
<P>
Qaidam also has 150 billion cu.m. of proven gas reserves,
fourth largest in China, after Sichuan, Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, and
Tarim.
</P>
<P>
The 24 square kilomater Qinghai oilfield, which was first
developed in 1954, has produced 15.5 million tons of crude oil and
refined nearly eight million tons of them. Nearly a billion yuan
has been spent on oil and gas exploration, increasing reserves by
40 million tons annually.
</P>
<P>
The China National Petroleum Corporation, Qinghai Provincial
Government, and the US's Amoco will develop large chemical
projects to produce chloride, caustic soda, synthetic ammonia, and
urea, in Golmud in the middle of the Qaidam Basin, during the
Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
Two gas pipes with a combined length of nearly 300 kilometers
and a gas-powered station with an installed capacity of 16,000
kilowatts are now in operation. A third 280-km gas pipe linking
the Qinghai Petroleum Administration and Dunhuang in Gansu
Province and a project of the Golmud Oil Refinery, which will
produce 100,000 tons of methanol annually, will be launched in
1999.
</P>
<P>
The Qaidam basin is a key oil and gas region for China's
National Petroleum Corporation, and will have an annual oil output
of three million tons by the year 2000, and ten million tons by
2005.

Zagreb, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Wesly Clark, Supreme Allied
Commander in NATO, held talks with Croatian Defense Minister
Gojko Susak on regional security, cooperation between Croatia
and NATO and especially cooperation between Croatia and the
NATO-led Multi-national Stablization Force (SFOR) Monday.
</P>
<P>
Clark arrived here the same day for his first visit to Croatia.
</P>
<P>
Under the NATO-Croatia cooperation agreement, Croatia allows
SFOR to use Split and Porec, and station its rear-services in the
ports.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Croatia also allows SFOR to use its air space and
roads to transport troops, military equipments and materials to
Bosnia-Hezegovina, and to base its headquarters in Zagreb, the
capital.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Clark said NATO and SFOR were looking
forward to the implementation by Croatia of all the provisions
stipulated in the Dayton Accord.
</P>
<P>
On Croatia's participation in NATO's Partnership for Peace
program, Clark said Susak mentioned the subject during the talks,
but NATO, despite its notice of Croatia's desire, had until now
taken no clear position.
</P>
<P>
Susak also announced that he will visit the U.S. on the 30th of
this month.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Finance Minsiter Urged for Talks with IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Central Bank of Kenya (CBK)
Governor Micah Cheserem has urged new Finance Minister Simeon
Nyachae to re-open talks with the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) which cut a key aid package to Kenya last year.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between Kenya and IMF, and a three-year
205-million-Dollar aid package were suspended on July 31 since
the latter doubted that the Kenyan government had the
determination to end corruption.
</P>
<P>
Chesrem said: "Talks with the IMF and World Bank and other
donors will lead to availability of funding needed to finance
infrastructure, repair and upgrading of roads. We do not have
that money."
</P>
<P>
Nyachae, who was appointed last week, would face a shortage of
money necessary for outstanding development projects, local press
reports quoted Cheserem as saying today.
</P>
<P>
A resumption of IMF lending is expected to also release more
funds from the World Bank and bilateral donors to the eastern
African country.
</P>
<P>
As Finance Minister, Nyachae is the leader in economic policy
and the Central Bank will continue its advisory role in helping
him to manage the economy, Cheserem added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, reports said an IMF team is set to visit Kenya on
February 9 to resume talks with Nyachae on the suspended loan
program under Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF).
</P>
<P>
An experienced and forceful Nyachae has been widely regarded
in the local business community as a command economy enthusiast
and a supporter of intervention.
</P>
<P>
At the handing over ceremony last week, Nyachae said he has
initiated reforms in agriculture, particularly in the tea,
coffee, and cereals industries, but he said he had no intention
to drastically change the economic programs launched by his
predecessor Musalia Mudavadi.
</P>
<P>
Kenya and IMF agreed in September on measures to "strengthen
management of the energy sector, safeguard the independence of
the KRA, ensure that Anti-Corruption Authority would be
independent and establish accountability for past financial
infractions."

BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Land-locked Shanxi Province in
north China will concentrate itself on exploring markets in
Latin America, India, Russia, the Middle East, Africa and
Australia in the next few years.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies President's Speech as Response to US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran has strongly rejected the
reports that the interview of Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
with the Cable News Network (CNN) was a response to Washington's
message for government-to-government dialog.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official news agency IRNA Tuesday quoted the
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi as saying Monday that
Khatami's interview was an initiative for opening up a dialog
with the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Such an initiative could not, under any circumstances, be
regarded as a reply to any U.S. message," Mohammadi said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "according to the same old procedure and
protocol any exchange of notes between the Islamic Republic of
Iran and the United States has been conducted through the
U.S. interest office at the Swiss embassy in Tehran and that
Iran has always dispatched its clear responses through the
same channel."
</P>
<P>
Washington Post reported Friday that the U.S. Administration
secretly made a proposal to the Iranian government for
face-to-face talks.
</P>
<P>
The report did not give details about Washington's proposal,
but saying that the proposal was raised in a letter to the
Iranian government through the U.S. interest office at the Swiss
embassy in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Many western media said that Khatami's interview with CNN
broadcast Thursday was a response to the U.S. proposal and some
U.S. officials considered Khatami's call for cultural dialog as "a
kind of public answer" to Washington's message.
</P>
<P>
In his first address to the "great American people," Khatami
called for exchanges between Iranian and American professors,
writers, scholars, artists, journalists and tourists, but
stressing that Iran "feels no need to have diplomatic ties with
the U.S." since Washington has not changed its attitude towards
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Observers and diplomats here said that Khatami's remark on
need for Iran to have ties with the U.S. indicated many
hurdles still exist on the way for a possible rapprochement
between the two sworn enemies.

<P>
TEHRAN, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry has
condemned terrorist activities against innocent people in
Pakistan, Tehran radio reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi Monday termed
recent criminal acts of terrorists against Shiite Muslims in
Pakistan during the holy fasting month of Ramadan as "savage."
</P>
<P>
Media reports said that at least 22 people were killed Sunday
when unidentified attackers opened fire on a crowd at a Shia
Muslim religious ceremony in the Pakistani city of Lahore.
</P>
<P>
The massacre triggered a new wave of demonstration in
Pakistan, in which the demonstrators urged the Pakistani
government to take more serious measures against terrorist
activities in the country.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that the attack on the defenseless civilians at
the time of their performance of religious ceremonies is a clear
demonstration of enmity with Islam.

<P>
He called on the Pakistani government to continue its campaign
against terrorist groups in the country and try to use all means
possible within its power to fully quell the inhuman terrorist
elements "so that Pakistani community could once more live under

ZAGREB, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Serb Democratic Party (SDP)
Monday was obstructing the work of the Bosnian Serb Parliament, an
international official said in Sarajevo Monday.
</P>
<P>
During the parliament's Monday session held in Bijeljina, SDP
members attempted to start a debate on insignificant issues
instead of discussing the establishment of parliament working
bodies and a new government, the International High

</P>
<P>
With the help of the Serb Radical Party, the SDP also rejected
the premier nomination by President Biljana Plavsic.
</P>
<P>
However, a new president and two vice-presidents of the
parliament were elected during the session.
</P>
<P>
The SDP lost a majority to form government by itself after the

BANGKOK, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The budget for the 13th Asian
Games to be held in Bangkok in December has been cut for the
second time in as many weeks to the bare minimum, organisers said
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok Asian Games Organising Committee deputy secretary
general Santiparp Techavanij said the new budget was 2.09 billion
baht (37.3 million U.S. dollars), from the original figure of 2.9
billion baht.
</P>
<P>
Santiparp said this was the minimum budget for the city to
organise the games of international standard.
</P>
<P>
Last week, althogh the government said the expenditures
forecasts were incomplete, it trimmed the budget to 2.2 billion
baht.
</P>
<P>
In another blow to games organisers, one of the event's main
corporate sponsors has sought a reduction in its promised
commitment in the light of the economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
Santiparp said Tuesday every venue would be ready in time for
the December 6 to 20 sports gala, adding games organisers had

<HEADLINE> Philippines Considers Cuts in Corn Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Department of
Agriculture is considering sharply lowering tariffs on yellow corn
imports as a "temporary relief" to the livestock industry being
battered by the financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
The department will likely reduce corn tariff rates to a low of
3 percent to save the livestock industry, Assistant Agriculture
Secretary Marinela Castillo said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The country now imposes tariffs ranging from 35 to 80 percent
on yellow corn imports. Certain quotas are allowed at a minimum 35
percent but the rest has to be imported at higher tariffs.
</P>
<P>
The livestock industry's production gains have been on a
downhill due to the currency crisis sweeping Asia since July 1997.
The crisis has sent interest rates and production cost
skyrocketing.
</P>
<P>
Industry leaders projected that livestock production for 1998
would drop by a minimum of 15 percent to a maximum of 25 percent,
surpassing the 10 percent annual growth made in the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
Castillo said that there is an immediate need to cushion the
impact of the financial turmoil going on in the region on the
country's livestock industry by giving temporary relief through
the reduction of tariff rates.
</P>
<P>
According to Castillo, the government's recommendation is to
cut the corn tariff rates to 3 percent though the industry's
preference is a reduction to the zero level.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Agriculture is going to draft its
recommendation for submission to the Department of Justice, which
will decide whether the measure is legal in view of the existing
requirements of the World Trade Organization.

GUANGZHOU, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-one people were given
the title "Honorary Citizen" by Heyuan in south China's Guangdong
Province as they invested more than two million US dollars each in
developing the economy of the poverty-stricken mountainous city.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the open policy, Heyuan has contracted 1.7 billion US
dollars worth of overseas funds and actually used 500 million of
that, since 1988, and got more than 100 million US dollars in
overseas funding in 1997, according to Yang Huawei, the city's
mayor.
</P>
<P>
Because of its rich natural resources and cheap labor, much of
the funding has gone into the city's agriculture, forestry and
processing of farm products, bringing rapid development, he said.
</P>
<P>
And, as a result, its joint ventures, co-operative enterprises
and wholely foreign-funded companies had 87.5 million US dollars
worth of output and 7.5 million US dollars in exports by the end
of 1997, both up more than 40 percent from a decade ago, according

<HEADLINE> No Big Aftershocks Expected in Zhangbei, Shangyi Regions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- No earthquakes exceeding
Saturday's 6.2 temblor are expected to strike the Zhangbei and
Shangyi areas soon, the State Seismological Bureau said.
</P>
<P>
But the bureau didn't rule out the possibility of mid-magnitude
aftershocks.
</P>
<P>
By 6 a.m. today, 349 aftershocks had occurred in the region, 10
of which were above 4.0 on the Richter scale. The largest
aftershock so far measured 4.6, according to the State
Seismological Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Aftershocks occur in various forms, said Ding Jianhai, a
researcher with the Earthquake Analysis and Prediction Center
under the State Seismological Bureau. They may cease immediately
after the earthquake or continue for a long period of time, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Aftershocks of the Tangshan Earthquake in 1976, which claimed
hundreds of thousands of lives, can still be detected, he said.
</P>
<P>
"An earthquake is the adjustment of the Earth's inner
structure, which needs time to reach a balance, so it is quite
natural for several mid-magnitude aftershocks to occur in this
time period," Ding said.
</P>
<P>
Gao Xu, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Seismological
Bureau, said that no detectable earthquake has occurred in the
capital since Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Even if strong aftershocks occur in the quake-affected regions
around Zhangjiakou, it will not pose threats to the capital," he
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's earthquake measuring 6.2 on the Richter scale struck
the Zhangbei and Shangyi regions in north China's Hebei Province,
killing 50 people and leveling 103,000 houses. Emergency relief
work is under way.

<HEADLINE> Asian Currency Crisis May Cut Australian Coal Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The current Asian currency
crisis is likely to push down the price of Australian coal exports
despite continuing strong demand, an Australian local mineral
council said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Most people have been expecting some sort of price fall,"
Denis Porter, acting executive director of the New South Wales
(state) Minerals Council told Australian Broadcasting Corporation
Radio.
</P>
<P>
"There is still a strong demand for energy out there in the
Asian region, a strong demand for coal," he said. "We would expect
to see some growth continuing, although I think the growth will be
trimmed substantially in a number of countries."
</P>
<P>
Representatives of major Australian companies were in Japan
this week negotiating the price of thermal coal.
</P>
<P>
Porter said contracts were negotiated in American dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar has devalued against the U.S. dollar and
this is good for exporters, who get more Australian dollars back
for every U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
"So if the Australian dollar stays down that's good news for us
and it would help us withstand a fall, if there were to be a fall,
in the U.S. dollar price of coal," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Expert Says It's Not Bigfoot, It's Just Big Bears (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The legendary bigfoot, or yeti,
of the Himalayan mountains could simply be a brown bear, according
to one Chinese wildlife expert.
</P>
<P>
Liu Wulin, the head of the Forestry Department's Wildlife
Protection Office in the Tibet Autonomous Region, says that the
hides and bones they have that are supposed to be bigfoot are
clearly from some beast.
</P>
<P>
After more than ten years' search for the creature in Medong,
Gyirong, Nangxian, Tingri, and Yadong counties, Liu is certain
that the footprints he's seen that are 20 to 30 centimeters long
and similar to those of human beings, were made by brown bears.
</P>
<P>
"It must be bears leaving those marks that lack an arch, but
the pads really resemble man's," Liu says. The brown bear is an
endangered species under strict protection. It usually lives in
caves 3,500 meters above sea level in northern Tibet, according to
Liu, who is in charge of the Lhasa branch of the Administrative
Office for the Import and Export of Endangered Species.
</P>
<P>
In Tibetan legend, female bears liked harassing women while
male bears love to kidnap attractive women.
</P>
<P>
In fact, dozens of brown bears from the northern Tibetan
prairies gather in natural caves in Amdo County in the
summertime. They go into a cave and leave out of it in a
queue. Scientists say that this bear convention remains an
inexplicable mystery.
</P>
<P>
But, local people confuse the brown bear with bigfoot, and
don't even want to look at the beast because of the legend. It is
supposed that the brown bear has a red nose, mouth, and hair.

Williams began limping from cramps in her right leg late in the
second set and required a medical timeout and treatment on court
at 1-1 in the third set.
</P>
<P>
But Hingis failed to capitalize on the injury and took her
medical timeout to deal with cramps at 5-5 before Williams swept
the final two games, winning both at love.
</P>
<P>
Last January, Hingis won the Sydney tournament and then the
Australian Open in Melbourne before she overtook Germany's Steffi
Graf as world number one in March.

Williams will play either Magdalena Maleeva of Bulgaria or
fellow American Chanda Rubin in the quarter-finals.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Exports Do Well Despite Asia's Financial Turmoil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's exports have
successfully weathered Southeast Asia's financial turmoil to hit a
new high in 1997, according to a senior municipal official.
</P>
<P>
Statistics record 14.7 billion U.S. dollars in exports for
1997, up 11.2 percent over the previous year and representing the
sixth year of sustained growth.
</P>
<P>
However, Zhu Xiaoming, head of the municipal foreign trade and
economic commission, said it may be difficult for Shanghai to
maintain its momentum this year.
</P>
<P>
Foreign financial problems, especially in Japan and the
Republic of Korea, have had negative effects on Shanghai's
exports, he said, because 34 percent of its trade is with these
two countries.
</P>
<P>
"It is time to make an overall structural reform in the city's
foreign trade sector to alleviate the problem," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The planned restructuring will emphasize high-value-added and
high-technology exports.
</P>
<P>
In exploring overseas export markets, Zhu said that -- apart
from furthering efforts in Japan, North America and European
countries -- attempts also will be made in South Africa, Latin
America and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Shanghai has worked out preferential policies to
encourage the city's large companies to enhance their overseas
presence, especially in South Africa and Southeast Asia, according
to Zhu.
</P>
<P>
He added that Shanghai will give priority to developing exports
of such international services as tourism, transportation,
contracted projects, retail commerce and consultation.
</P>
<P>
The city has been listed by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation as a pilot in developing international
service trade, Zhu said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Expert Says It's Not Bigfoot, It's Just Big Bears (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
But, the hair Liu got in one village convinced him that it was
just brown bear's.
</P>
<P>
In the Himalayas, there are said to be many abominable snowmen,
or yetis, but, again, Liu says he thinks the creatures, which are
described as being like tall human beings, are just white-haired
bears.
</P>
<P>
"The bears usually hibernate in winter, but some go looking for
food below the snow line," Liu explains, and brown bears' hair can
turn grey or white.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese encyclopedia, the 'Cihai', calls a type of
white-and-black bear as the newly-discovered Tibetan panda, and
the Encyclopedia Britannica has a similar description, which Liu
insists is a mistake.
</P>
<P>
"Even if the bigfoot, or yeti, did exist, it would be doomed to
extinction because of its tiny population and inbreeding," Liu
explained.
</P>
<P>
Around the globe, bigfoot is listed as one of four major
mysteries, in the company of UFOs (unidentified flying objects),
the Loch Ness monster, and the Bermuda Triangle.
</P>
<P>
One Tibetan theologian and poet of the 11th century was the
first to record description of the creature, and the stories have
been kept alive since the 1950s, when nearby Nepal opened its
doors to tourists.
</P>
<P>
In recent decades, many teams of searchers have gone around
looking for the creature, but no one has ever provided any solid
proof to support the belief that these are humans' close relative.
</P>
<P>
In fact, there are hardly any photos, just some
suspicious-looking footmarks, but, in the meantime, locals repeat
the stories about sightings of bigfoot.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The economy in Shenzhen,
China's leading special economic zone, developed steadily in 1997
with its focus on reforming state-owned enterprises and opening to
the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong Province statistics show that the city's gross
domestic product (GDP) in 1997 increased by 16 percent to 113
billion yuan (14.1 billion U.S. dollars), and its industrial
output was up 17.5 percent to 125.5 billion yuan (15.7 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The production value of 18 major company groups accounted for
56.7 percent of the city's total.
</P>
<P>
New, high-technology industries in telecommunications, new
materials and biological engineering have developed rapidly with
the value of their products topping 47.4 billion yuan (5.9 billion
U.S. dollars). That figure was 35 percent of the city's total
industrial output.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the city invested 39 billion yuan (4.87
billion U.S. dollars) in fixed assets, an increase of 19.1 percent
over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The asset-to-liability ratio of the city's state-owned
enterprises has dropped from 70.23 percent at the beginning of
1997 to 66 percent at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The city also recorded 45 billion U.S. dollars in imports and
exports, up 15.2 percent over the 1996 figure. International
shipping increased 143.56 percent. Electro-mechanical equipment
continued to dominate the city's exports, accounting for 56.7
percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the south China city obtained revenues of
14.4 billion yuan (1.8 billion U.S. dollars), 28 percent more than
1996. Retail sales were up 9.3 percent and the consumer price
index rose by 3 percent. The per-capita GDP was 3,692
U.S. dollars, ranking first in the country, according to the

<HEADLINE> Cholera Affects Tanzania's Exports of Fish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Due to an outbreak of
cholera in east Africa, the European Union (EU) has imposed a ban
on the exports of fresh fish fillets from northern Tanzania's
Mwanza Region skirting the Lake Victoria.
</P>
<P>
Frozen fish fillets, however, have not been banned, The
Guardian today quoted an official with the Lake Victoria Fish
Processing Industries Association as saying.
</P>
<P>
The official, who requested anonymity, said in Mwanza on
Monday that the ban would affect all fishing industries by 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
"Fifty percent of our products are fresh fish fillets which
have a reliable market in the world and the remaining half are
frozen fish fillets which do not attract customers," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The ban, though temporarily imposed, will hurt greatly the
economy in areas around Lake Victoria, the world's second-largest
freshwater lake.

<HEADLINE> Helping Deaf-Mute Children Escape Limits of Silent World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Thanks to extensive
rehabilitation, eight-year-old Li Mingming, of China's
Heilongjiang province, who has been deaf since birth, can now
attend class and listen to teachers just like other children.
</P>
<P>
The boy is one of 160 deaf-mute children here who have regained
their sense of speach and hearing after a period of training.
</P>
<P>
China has more than a million deaf-mute children aged 14 and
under, many of their problems having been caused by improper
medical treatment. Although many are not completely deaf,
treatment was usually considered unhelpful or useless.
</P>
<P>
The region's deaf-mute rehabilitation center has made a great
effort to develop whatever hearing remains in children with
disabilities by using physiotherapy, magnetotherapy, and other
forms of therapy.
</P>
<P>
Teachers in the center live with six or seven students and form
a big family. They eat, play, and study with the children, giving
them extensive training in listening and speaking at any hour of
the day, one teacher in her 20s explains.
</P>
<P>
Out of a total of 280 deaf-mute children, 57 have been able to
leave the silent world and have begun new lives in local primary
schools, with an average period of convalescence of one and a half
year, more than two years ahead of the state's intended time
frame.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Article Stresses Importance of Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily, China's
leading newspaper, today published a front page commentator's
article stressing the importance of unity.
</P>
<P>
The article notes that many important issues wait to be
resolved in 1998 such as reforming state-owned enterprises, the
re-employment of laid-off workers, shifting functions and
streamlining government bodies, and electing new governments and
legislatures across the country.
</P>
<P>
"All these require us to further improve the unity of the whole
Party and people of all ethnic groups across the country,
especially the unity among leading officials at all levels," the
article states.
</P>
<P>
It points out that the most important thing in seeking unity is
to unify people's thinking, adding that the common ideal lies in
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and
comprehensively reinvigorating the country.
</P>
<P>
"We must strictly follow the basic theories, line and policies
of the Party and unswervingly unite around the Party Central
Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core," it states. "Only this
kind of unity could be considered powerful and invincible."
</P>
<P>
The article urges all Party and government officials to put the
interests of the people, Party and country in first place under
all circumstances and to pay close attention to the people's
difficulties, complaints and wishes.
</P>
<P>
It also stresses that the key to achieving all kinds of unity
is the unity among leading officials.
</P>
<P>
The article calls on leading officials at all levels,
especially the first and second, to treasure unity as their lives
and try to set examples.
</P>
<P>
"Unity is strength and will lead to triumph," the article
notes. "As long as we unite together and combine the wisdom and
strength of the whole Party and people of all ethnic groups, no
difficulty could halt our advancing paces," it concludes.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Dhaka Expects Summit to Break </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina has great expectations for the forthcoming three-South
Asian-nation summit, which is scheduled to be held here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The summit, the first of its kind for heads of government of
Bangladesh, India and Pakistan to gather outside the South Asian
Association for Cooperation (SARRC) forum, is largely seen as
another diplomatic success for Hasina, who received Italian Prime
Minister Romano Prodi just a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
Similar to Prodi's visit, the first of an Italian premier to
this South Asian nation, the tripartite meeting will become the
first of its kind to provide opportunities for the three prime
ministers to address the issue of economic cooperation and
partnership development, setting aside political differences and
other disputes, reports said.
</P>
<P>
"It is not a prime ministers' summit, it is a business summit,
the summit has nothing to do with politics," Bangladesh Foreign
Minister Abdus Samad Azad told reporters on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He noted that his country expects the summit to bring about a
climate of change, to accelerate the pace of economic development
and expand trade among the three countries.
</P>
<P>
"We can't just wait till resolution of political conflicts,
rather we will have to cope with the vibrant changes taking place
in the world," said Yussuf Abdullah Harun, president of the
Federation of Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industry, on a
different occasion.
</P>
<P>
The summit, originally slated for November 23 last year, but
postponed because of "political compulsions" in Islamabad and New
Delhi, was first proposed by Hasina at the SARRC summit in Male,
capital of the Maldives, in May last year.
</P>
<P>
The one-day summit, which will center on cooperation in trade,
joint-venture investment, energy and infrastructure facilities,
will also be attended by business delegations and representatives
of the chambers of commerce from the three countries, with the aim
of achieving close interaction between government and the private
sector.
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral and his Pakistani
counterpart, Nawaz Sharif, will each lead a 30-odd-strong
delegation while Hasina heads a bigger business delegation.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi businessmen hope the business summit to continue as
an annual event with the three capitals serving as the host by
rotation, according to Harun.
</P>
<P>
"How to face the rest of the world in terms of protecting our
interests in areas we have advantages" would be a key question,
Bangladeshi Foreign Secretary Mustafizur Rahman said. "We will
devise ways how to cooperate and in what areas to cooperate."
</P>
<P>
"We need to emerge as a bloc to negotiate in the global market,
" said Harun. "Unless we get together and pull our resources
together, we cannot face the enormous challenges from the West."
</P>
<P>
The tripartite summit may be confined to economic issues only,
but leaders from the three countries will also deal with other
topics on a bilateral basis, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
The simultaneous presence of the Indian and Pakistani prime
ministers in the Bangladesh capital provides opportunities for the
three leaders to hold separate discussions on issues in their
respective bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Hasina is expected to have talks with Gujral, who will arrive
here on Wednesday afternoon and leave on Thursday after the
summit, on the trade imbalance between the two countries,
developments in the diplomatic field and possibly, issues
concerning the implementation of the Ganges water sharing treaty
between the two nations and the Chittagong Hill Tracts accord
between the Bangladesh government and tribal rebels, the analysts
say.
</P>
<P>
And with Sharif, Hasina is expected to discuss trade imbalance,
repatriation of stranded Pakistanis in Bangladesh and such issues
as cooperation in regional and international fora, according to
the analysts.
</P>
<P>
Sharif is scheduled to arrive on Thursday morning and pay a
two-day official visit to Dhaka after the summit.
</P>
<P>
Gujral and Sharif are also likely to use the opportunity to
hold bilateral talks.
</P>
<P>
The summit, which will adopt a Dhaka Declaration calling for
more private-sector cooperation in trade, joint ventures,
transport and communications, will make a positive contribution to
strengthening economic ties among the three nations.

<HEADLINE> S'pore Parliament to Sit on Regional Crisis Impact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore Parliament is
expected to give priority to discussions on the region's currency
crisis and its impact on the republic's economy Wednesday when it
starts its first session this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Order Paper of the first session of the Ninth
Parliament of Singapore, which was released to the media on
Tuesday, at least four questions will be raised by the ruling
People's Action Party (PAP), opposition and nominated MPs about
the extent to which Singapore is exposed to the current financial
crisis in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Nominated MP Chuang Shaw Peng will ask Deputy Prime Minister
Lee Hsien Loong, who is also chairman of the Monetary Authority of
Singapore, about the extent of additional exposures Singapore
financial institutions have suffered to bad loans made to regional
economies with rapidly falling currency and equity values and
whether such exposures will lead to banking crises similar to
those in Thailand, South Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
MP Chng Hee Kok wants to know what is the impact of rising
interest rates on the economy.
</P>
<P>
In the previous two rounds of interest hikes toward the end of
last year, major local banks had already raised their prime
lending rates by one percentage point to 7 percent. And a new
round of prime rate hikes is expected in the near future, as the
key three-month interbank interest rate stayed way too high over
the prime rate.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Workers' Party MP Low Thia Khiang will ask the
minister of finance about the actions Singapore can pursue should
the Indonesian government default on repayment of the loans
extended by Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Singapore People's Party chief MP Chiam See Tong will question
whether the crisis will affect the government's Housing Board
upgrading program as promised by the PAP in the general election
in early 1997.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, who is on an overnight working
visit to Jakarta on Tuesday, will rush back home just in time for
the parliament sitting Wednesday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Flamingoes Increase in Kenya's Lake of Nakuru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Unofficial data from the
bi-annual African water fowl census launched at central Kenya's
Lake Nakuru National Park on Sunday indicated a rapid increase in
the flamingo population over last year.
</P>
<P>
Although the results are not yet out, participants in the
count said the flamingoes numbered more than one million, the
Daily Nation newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Only about 5,000 flamingoes had been left at the lake last
year after a severe water recession as a result of drought. But
the lake's water level has been rising due to the current heavy
rains.
</P>
<P>
The birds then had migrated to lakes Bogoria and Elmentaita
while some flocks had flown to northern Lake Turkana.
</P>
<P>
All these are alkaline lakes located in the Rift Valley, the
habitat of the fowl that has a large red bill and coral-red outer
wing coverts.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the flamingoes, pelicans and Egyptian geese have
also returned to Lake Nakuru in large numbers.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou to Build New International Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou, capital of south
China's Guangdong Province, will start the construction of a new
international airport later this year.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Lin Shusen said Monday at a news conference that the
city would ensure that the airport's first phase would be ready
for service in 2001, in time for the Ninth National Games.
</P>
<P>
Baiyun International Airport, located inside the city proper,
is one of the busiest airports in China. To cater to demands of
aviation transport, construction of a new airport in suburban
Guangzhou was proposed and approved by the State Council and the
Central Military Commission in July of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The new airport will sit at the juncture of Renhe Town of the
Baiyun District and Xinhua Town of Huadu City. It will cover an
area of 1,453 hectares and will have three runways. When
completed, the new airport will be able to handle 80 million
passengers and 2.5 million tons of cargo a year.
</P>
<P>
In the first phase, two runways will be finished. When the
first phase is completed, the airport will be able to handle 27
million passengers a year.
</P>
<P>
The new airport will cost 20 billion yuan. An airport company
will be established with shareholders from the Civil Aviation
Administration of China (CAAC), Guangdong Province and Guangzhou
City. The company will be responsible for 35 percent, or 5.2
billion yuan, of the total investment. The remaining investment
will come from CAAC, Guangdong Province, Guangzhou City and China
Southern Airlines.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Lin said that the city is also looking for overseas
loans for the new airport's construction, in addition to several
state financial organizations which have shown strong interest
in financing the project.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin, more than 20,000 people from 6,000 rural
families in nine villages will have to relocate. Buildings
covering a combined floor space of more than 1 million square
meters are being torn down and relocated.

<HEADLINE> Internet Use Is Booming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Internet users were estimated
to number 99.96 million at the end of 1997 and the number is
growing, according to a United States industry publication.
</P>
<P>
The California-based Computer Industry Almanac Inc., which
publishes the Internet Industry Almanac, said in a press release
Monday that the U.S. leads the world in Internet use, having 54.68
million users and a 54.70 percent share of the world Internet
market at the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
But as more and more people enjoyed the benefits brought to
them by the new technology, smaller industrialized countries with
the largest number of Internet users were expected to be replaced
by the most populous countries such as China and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Almanac, to be released in February, predicts that the
U.S. share of world Internet market will dip to 40 percent by the
end of 2000 as more and more countries adopt Internet technology.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. share was about 80 percent in 1981 and 65 percent in
1994.
</P>
<P>
Other countries with more than one million Internet users are
Japan, Britain, Canada, Germany, Australia, the Netherlands,
Sweden, Finland and France.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Backs Djukanovic in Montenegro Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States will firmly
stand by newly-elected President Milo Djukanovic in the present
political crisis in Montenegro, said a U.S. envoy for former
Yugoslavia on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Robert Gelbard announced this after separate meetings with
Djukanovic and Montenegro's outgoing President Momir Bulatovic in
the Montenegrin capital Podgorica, Belgrade-based Evening News
reported.
</P>
<P>
Gelbard stressed that his visit to Montenegro indicated
Washington's firm support for Djukanovic's election in the
democratic process.
</P>
<P>
Gelbard warned Bulatovic, who is stepping down on January 15,
that he would risk serious mistakes should he go against the
public will expressed in the presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Djukanovic, the incumbent prime minister of Montenegro, beat
Bulatovic in the second round of the presidential elections on
October 19, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Despite recognitions of the election results by Western
countries, Bulatovic and his supporters refused to accept the
results. They charged Djukanovic with malpractice in the
elections, and have been calling protests against Djukanovic since.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered in front
of the Assembly Hall protesting against the result of the
elections.

<HEADLINE> NZ Banks Raise Lending Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wellington, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The ASB Bank has become the
latest New Zealand money lender to put up its floating mortgage
rates.
</P>
<P>
The bank announced Tuesday that it has raised its floating
mortgage rate by half a percentage point to 10.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The decision followed similar moves taken Tuesday by the
ANZ-Post Bank and the Countrywide Bank.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Bank of New Zealand, the Citibank and the Hong Kong
Bank also increased their lending rates to around 10.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The rise is related to the recent fall in the value of the New
Zealand dollar, which pushed up wholesale interest rates.

<HEADLINE> Shift in Preference to Semi-luxury cars in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 13 (Xinhua)-- Even as the automobile
industry in India faces a sharp slowdown reflective of the overall
economic situation, there is a discernible shift in consumer
preferences from economy cars to semi-luxury ones in the country,
said a survey here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This trend comes at a time when several global players and
domestic majors are expected to hit the road with semi-luxury cars
this year.
</P>
<P>
A quick look at the sales data for the first eight months of
the current fiscal year (April 1, 1997-March 31, 1998) has shown
that while economy segment car sales went up by 4.9 percent,
semi-luxury cars showed a massive 58.79 percent growth.
</P>
<P>
Keen observers of the automobile sector believe that the
semi-luxury cars would be attracting most attention at the Auto
Expo '98 scheduled from January 15 to 21 this year. The exhibition
will display an unprecedented presentation from almost all the
world's top automobile manufacturers.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Welcomes Proposals on Northern Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Monday welcomed proposals mapped out by Britain and Ireland on
achieving a peaceful settlement on the dispute over the British
province of Northern Ireland, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
"The president welcomed the initiative of the Irish and British
governments to present 'Propositions for Heads of Agreement' aimed
at moving the Northern Ireland peace talks process forward," the
White House said in a two-sentence statement.
</P>
<P>
"The president encouraged the participants in the talks, who
have the responsibility to shape the substance of a peace
settlement, to seize the moment and begin negotiating details of
an agreement," added the statement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, in a document called "Propositions on Heads
of Agreement," governments of Ireland and Britain proposed a new
intergovernmental pact, an elected Northern Ireland assembly and
an all-Ireland ministerial council.
</P>
<P>
The proposals, which politicians from Protestant and Roman
Catholic parties will discuss further Tuesday, also envisage
changes to the Irish republic's constitutional claims over
northern Ireland and to the legislation by which London rules the
province.
</P>
<P>
Since Christmas three people have been shot dead by rival
pro-British and republican guerrilla factions opposed to peace
efforts by British and Irish governments.

<HEADLINE> Boeing, Airbus in Price War for Air India Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Boeing and Airbus have
leashed an all out price war to woo Air India (AI) which is
expected to buy three 200-seater and one 400-seater aircraft in
the near future, local newspaper "The Hindustan Times" said here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Even as Air India has called for fresh offers from both global
giants to expedite purchase of four aircraft to meet its expansion
plans, the two rivals have indicated that they would offer amazing
price cuts to win over the national carrier.
</P>
<P>
The contenders for order are Airbus A310-300 with 200 seats and
Boeing B767-200 with 190 seats. Boeing has taken an aggressive
posture by indicating that it would slash its prices by a big
margin to enable Air India to save over 2,000 million rupees
(54.05 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
As compared to the listed price of 80 million dollars for each
B767-200, the company is willing to shave off 15 million dollars
to offer the product to Air India at 65 million dollars per
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the B767-200 would have the capacity to fly
non-stop to London and Tokyo giving the national carrier longer
range as compared to A-310. There is also an accusation that
Airbus was trying to sell a product which is being phased out.
</P>
<P>
While accusing Boeing of trying to hawk a product which has not
been sold to any other airline since 1993, the European consortium
has also indicated its willingness to drop prices to match its
American rival.

COLOMBO, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
expressed its determination to proceed with its proposed political
settlement of the ethnic problem even though the main opposition,
the United National Party (UNP), fails to give its support to the
package.
</P>
<P>
Justice, Constitutional Affairs and Ethnic Affairs Minister G.
L. Peiris said Monday that the People's Alliance (PA) government
is determined to hold a non-binding referendum in case the UNP
does not put forward its proposals by the end of this month, the
Daily News newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation of the UNP is essential for the PA to ensure a
two-thirds majority in the parliament, which is mandatory for the
peace proposals to be adopted.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the referendum will be held under Article 86
of the Sri Lankan Constitution, which empowers the president to
place before the people any question of national importance.
</P>
<P>
The PA government has been trying to win support from the UNP
ever since the peace package was submitted to the parliament for
consideration in 1995.

PERTH, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Penny Heyns and Samantha Riley,
hailed as the best-ever women breastrokers in the world, are to
square off at the 100m final of the World Swimming Championships
here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Australian Riley, who swam the year's world best time of one
minute 7.81 seconds in Australia's World Championship trials last
year, won the 100m heats with a time of 1:08.58, just 0.08 seconds
clear of South African Heyns, world record holder and dual Olympic

</P>
<P>
European champion Agnes Kovacs of Hungary came third in the
heats by clocking 1:08.69.

Costa Rica's Olympic champion Claudia Poll cruised into the
women's 200m freestyle final after winning the heats in 1:59.82.

Poll is expected to win this title since world No.1 swimmer
Chen Yan of China skipped the event to concentrate on individual
medley instead.

Germany's Kerstin Kielgass, who beat world record holder and
Olympic silver medalist Franziska van Almisick in the German

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Deploy More Security Personnel in North </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government is to
deploy 6,000 more police and military personnel in Jaffna next
week to disarm the armed political groups and to man the January
29 local government elections in the north, security sources here
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Additional police personnel will be deployed in islands around
the Jaffna peninsula where armed members of the Eelam People's
Democratic Party (EDPD), a key Tamil political party contesting
the polls, are present, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
These members were allowed to carry arms because they were
cooperating with the government forces in fighting against the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
However, other political parties participating in the
forthcoming elections have repeatedly protested against the EDPD,
saying free and fair elections could not be held if the EDPD were
allowed to carry arms.
</P>
<P>
EDPD leader Douglas Devananda in response said he would disarm
his members if the government can provide additional security to
the islands where his party members had been protecting civilians
from the LTTE.

<HEADLINE> Romania Expects Zero Growth in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian government will
try to curb the trend of economic decline and achieve a zero
growth this year, Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the economic prospects in 1998, Ciorbea said the
gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to continue dropping in
the first half of this year, but will start to rise in the latter
half of the year.
</P>
<P>
He said strict control on financial deficits and inflation, and
a continued increase of foreign exchange reserves would be the top
priorities of the government in the new year.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said financial deficits would be controlled
within 4.2 percent of the GDP, and the inflation rate limited to
30-40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Financial authorities said financial deficits in 1997 accounted
for 4.5 percent of the GDP, while the inflation rate was as high
as 151.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Ciorbea said the government will step up efforts to reform the
industrial and agricultural sectors as well as financial
institutions. It had also planned to privatize 1,500 to 1,600
state-owned businesses among the total 4,000.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Official Optimistic About Indonesia's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Deputy Treasury
Secretary of the United States Lawrence Summers said Monday night
that he remained optimistic about Indonesia's economy.
</P>
<P>
Summers made the statement after a three-hour meeting with
Indonesian Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad, local press reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Summers, who arrived here on Monday, said his visit to
Indonesia was to perform a special mission for President Bill
Clinton during his visit.
</P>
<P>
He said he would meet Indonesian President Soeharto Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to carrying President Clinton's message to
President Soeharto tomorrow," he said.
</P>
<P>
Summers said earlier that he would expand his Asian tour and
visit Hong Kong, Beijing and Seoul to help boost confidence in the
crisis-ridden region.
</P>
<P>
During his visit in Indonesia, Summers will hold several
meetings with Coordinating Minister for Production and
Distribution Hartarto, Minister of Finance Mar'ie Muhammad and
Minister of Industry and Trade Tunky Ariwibowo.
</P>
<P>
Some industrialized countries, including the U.S., Japan,
Germany and Australia, have expressed their concern about the
monetary crisis in Indonesia in recent days. The Indonesian rupiah
declined to a record low of 11,000 per U.S. dollar last Thursday.
The currency has fallen more than 200 percent since July last
year.
</P>
<P>
The drastic fall of rupiah has slowed down the country's
economic activities and threatened businesses with closure and
mass layoff.
</P>
<P>
At the end of October last year, the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) agreed to provide 23 billion U.S. dollars in financial
and technical loans to Indonesia to help overcome its crisis and
Indonesia made a commitment to conduct economic and financial
reforms.
</P>
<P>
However, the IMF was reportedly dissatisfied over the process
of the reforms in Indonesia.

UNITED NATIONS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Monday reiterated his call on Iraq to cooperate with
the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of
destroying Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by the spokesman's office, the U.N. chief
also urged Iraq not to take precipitous action prior to the visit
of UNSCOM's Executive Chairman Richard Butler to Baghdad next week.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General was responding to a statement by an
official spokesman for Iraq with respect to the commission's
weapons inspection currently underway in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said Monday that it had decided to halt the work of a
U.N. arms inspection team headed by American Scott Ritter, whom
Baghdad had accused of spying for the United States.
</P>
<P>
That decision renewed the clash between Iraq and the
U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Late October, Iraq expelled Americans from the U.N. weapons
inspection teams, prompting a three-week long standoff between
Iraq and the United Nations.

<HEADLINE> Snowfall Adds to Problems in Quake-Hit Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHANGBEI, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Snowfall in north China this
morning has brought new problems for people in the area 220
kilometers northwest of Beijing which was damaged by a strong
earthquake that struck on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Local meteorological departments said the heavy snow falling
east of Zhangjiakou Prefecture in north China's Hebei province to
Beijing posed difficulties to transport of disaster relief
materials to Zhangbei and Shangyi counties, the hardest-hit areas
by the quake.
</P>
<P>
In addition, people in the quake-hit areas are expected to have
more problems recovering from the quake measuring 6.2 on the
Richter scale which killed 47 people and injured more than 10,000.
</P>
<P>
By 8:30 this morning, all of the traffic police in Zhangjiakou
Prefecture had been called out to assist the transit of
disaster-relief supplies.
</P>
<P>
Ren Zhongming, an official with the traffic police, told Xinhua
that eight snow plows have been used on city highways to clear the
roads for transport teams from other provinces and cities.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, another 20 traffic police vehicles are
patroling the major highways. No accidents have been reported from
Zhangjiakou and transport teams continued to arrive from many
parts of China.
</P>
<P>
Local meterological departments predict the temperature will
drop slightly in the next few days, but will decline by 5-to-8
degrees on Jan. 18 and 19.
</P>
<P>
The temperature at night in the quake-hit areas has been 20
degrees below zero Centigrade in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
Local people, rescue workers and armymen are redoubling their
efforts to put up more shelters for the quake victims. A rescue
team from the Red Cross Society of China is expected to arrive
here later today.

<HEADLINE> El Nino to Bring Dry-Season Drought to Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Meteorological Department
of Thailand has warned people living outside irrigated zones in
the country to prepare for dry-season droughts caused by the El
Nino weather phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
The department has urged people not to waste water, the local
press reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The country's lower north, northeast, upper central region and
east will be more seriously affected than other parts due to a
lack of irrigation projects.
</P>
<P>
El Nino, a flow of unusually warm water into the eastern
Pacific, takes place every four or five years and lasts 12 to 18
months. It began in May 1997 and has resulted in unusual weather
patterns in many countries, including Thailand.
</P>
<P>
It reduced rainfall across Thailand, especially in the upper
north, last year.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the volume of water in many reservoirs is low and
there will be a shortage of water between January and May. The
temperature during this period will also be higher than usual, the
department said.
</P>
<P>
Chakkraphan Yomchinda, spokesman of the Thai Interior Ministry,
said on Monday that the ministry has ordered all provinces and
concerned agencies to get personnel, equipment and water trucks
ready to help those affected.

according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
Attacks were committed by the National Liberation Army and the
Armed Revolutionary Forces of Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Both organizations increased their attacks last year against
the infrastructure of the country, specially in oil and power
sectors.
</P>
<P>
The 780-kilometer Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline carries oil from
Piedemonte Llanero, the largest oil field of Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline had suffered an annual average of 40 attacks
between 1986 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
Apart from economic and ecologic costs of oil spills over
several rivers, production suspension has caused a loss of 5.34
million barrels in these attacks.
</P>
<P>
The figure means some 85 million dollars of exports were
averted, added to repairs and environmental cleaning which costed
13.4 million dollars, the government said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Romania admitted 1 billion
U.S. dollars in foreign investment last year, the result of the
country's continued economic reform.
</P>
<P>
Romania's Mediafax news agency, quoted a report Monday by the
Vienna-based Institute of International Comparative Economy as
saying that although Poland and Hungary maintained the largest
share of foreign investment in Central and Eastern Europe, Romania
witnessed a very rapid growth in foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Romania had already absorbed a total of 3 billion U.S. dollars
over the past eight years.
</P>
<P>
The institute predicted Romania would maintain the momentum of
foreign investment growth at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
The agency attributed the foreign investment growth to the
country's rapid privatization process and inexpensive human
resources.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Set to Allow Duty-Free Corn Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
allow duty-free imports of yellow corn to enable poultry producers
to cut costs and export their surplus chicken to Hong Kong, local
newspaper the Business Daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Trade Secretary Cesar Bautista was quoted as saying Monday that
his department has agreed to do away with tariffs on feed corn
imports used by local poultry firms to make them more competitive.
</P>
<P>
Bautista said the Philippines would offer itself as a major
source of dressed chicken to Hong Kong which was recently hit by
the "bird flu" disease.
</P>
<P>
Local poultry producers said earlier that they could not
compete with other countries due to high production costs.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines imposes tariffs ranging from 35 percent to 80
percent on yellow corn imports. Certain quotas are allowed at a
minimum 35 percent but the rest has to be imported at higher
tariffs.
</P>
<P>
Trade officials and representatives of the country's poultry
industry will go to Hong Kong this week to check the prospects of
supplying frozen chicken to the city, according to Bautista.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong slaughtered about 1.4 million chickens earlier this
month to minimize the risk of the virus which is transmitted to
humans through direct contact with live birds.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Argentine internal
affairs department has decided to install video cameras in the
pitches to prevent violence in soccer competitions.
</P>
<P>
As soccer violences become rampant in the country, the
Argentine government has recently directed its Internal Affairs
department to take the responsibility of ensuring safety and
security in the sport.
</P>
<P>
With video cameras installed around the pitches, more policemen
were also dispatched there to ensure the flows of onlookers and to
arrest the troublemakers once violences erupt in the stadiums, the
Internal Affairs said.
</P>
<P>
Police authorities can even monitor the situation through video
cameras and dig out those troublemakers to ensure the security for
both players and audience.
</P>
<P>
The Internal Affairs was also enpowered to close down those
sports organizations who were caught of negligence and seeking
support of trouble-making fans by giving free tickets.
</P>
<P>
In December, one soccer fan was shot to death, with other eight
wounded in a national league match, fueling the cry for more
measures to be taken to ensure the safety of both players and fans
througout the country.

SHANGHAI, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai Port, China's
largest, handled 2.52 million TEUs of international containers in
1997, 550,000 TEUs more than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The figure represents a rise of 27.9 percent over 1996 and
makes the port eye-catching for increasing its container handling
volume over 26 percent for eight years running.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's fast-growing economy and its role as China's largest
commercial and manufacturing center have contributed to the port's
drastic expansion. Currently, the port handles one quarter of the
country's international cargo shipping and a third of the
country's container shipping, according to port officials.
</P>
<P>
To build Shanghai into an international shipping center, the
port has invested heavily in construction of container berths,
stacking yards and roads, said port officials.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai now has 19 shipping routes for international
containers and has set up business links with all of the world's

<HEADLINE> Philippine House Passes New Oil Deregulation Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine House of
Representatives Monday passed a new oil deregulation bill on the
third and final reading, paving the way for a quick congressional
passage of the vital oil bill.
</P>
<P>
A bicameral committee, composed of representatives from both
the House and the Senate, is expected to begin talks Tuesday night
to come up with a final congressional version of the oil bill.
</P>
<P>
The Senate approved its own bill on the oil industry's
deregulation last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The House' approval of the new oil bill came at the end of a
four-day special session of the Congress, which was called by
President Fidel Ramos to tackle the bill to enable the country's
exit from the control of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The old oil deregulation law, which took effect in February
1997, was nullified by the Supreme Court last November on the
ground that the law violated the constitution and the rule of free
trade.
</P>
<P>
The old law provided for a 7 percent tariff for refined
petroleum products, and a 3 percent tariff for crude oil, to
encourage firms to invest in the domestic refinery industry.
</P>
<P>
But the Supreme Court ruled that free trade would be hindered
if oil firms were forced to choose between investing huge amounts
in refineries and paying higher tariffs.
</P>
<P>
The abolishment of the old oil deregulation law prevented the
country from getting free from the decades of economic supervision
by the IMF before the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Under the new oil bill adopted by the House, a uniform 3
percent tariff will be imposed on both finished oil products and
crude oil.
</P>
<P>
The bill also provides a six-month transition period before the
full deregulation of the country's oil industry. During the
period, oil companies are barred from jacking up prices of
"socially sensitive" products like kerosene and diesel.

The certificates are also a must for many foreigners when they
seek jobs requiring some fluency in Chinese.

<HEADLINE> Ronaldo Wins FIFA Player of Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian soccer star Ronaldo was
named FIFA's Player of the Year for the second time in a row by a
majority of votes in Marne La Vallee, France on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I feel very honored to win this award, this distinction, at
such a young age," said the 21-year-old Ronaldo.
</P>
<P>
Over the past years, Ronaldo has helped his teams win the
Spanish Cup, the Netherlands Cup and the Copa America.
</P>
<P>
And Ronaldo, after winning the coveted honor, was still in the
mood for more trophies, especially the World Cup in France, saying
"as long as I have motivation I will still go on and want to win
more and more."
</P>
<P>
He is surely to spearhead Brazil this summer for his debut
World Cup as he was too young to compete in 1994 where he was an
unused substitute at 17.
</P>
<P>
The golden trophy was presented by Pele and FIFA president Joao
Havelange at a banquet with Ronaldo attending with his mother and
father.
</P>
<P>
Ronaldo scored 480 points with 86 first-place votes from the
121 possible, his Brazilian teammate Roberto Carlos, who plays for
Real Madrid was a distant second with 65 votes, just ahead of
Dutchman Dennis Bergkamp of Arsenal, and Frenchman Zinedine
Zidane, who plays for Juventus Turin. Bergkamp and Zidane scored
62 points.
</P>
<P>
National team coaches from 121 countries voted for the title.
Last year was closer, Ronaldo had 329 to Liberian George Weah,
second with 140.
</P>
<P>
Ronaldo became the first two-time winner of the world award,
which has only been given since 1991. Previous winners were
Lothar Matthaus of Germany, Marco van Basten of Netherlands,
Roberto Baggio of Italy, Romario of Brazil and Weah before Ronaldo
won for 1996.
</P>
<P>
Last month, he was named the European player of the season.
</P>
<P>
The only thing left for Ronaldo is to help his Brazilian team
win the World Cup in France starting in June.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Higher as Stocks Shake Rebound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar rose against
the Japanese yen and German mark Monday as U.S. stocks advanced
despite a selloff in overseas, especially in Hong Kong stocks.
</P>
<P>
Wall Street's gains encouraged traders to seek the dollar as a
haven from Asia's troubled financial markets. But lingering fears
that U.S. and Japanese central banks might move in concert to
support the sagging yen limited the dollar's rise.
</P>
<P>
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 132.69 yen,
up from 132.03 late Friday. The U.S. currency also was changing
hands at 1.8211 marks, up from 1.8204.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. currency has gained about 12 percent against the yen
since the beginning of 1997 amid Asia's economic crisis, reaching
a more than 5-year high of 133.78 on January 5.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday:

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Avoid Plunging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial
average avoided today an early 137-point slide triggered by
another rocky day in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Dow changed course three times during the session, rising
66.76 points to 7,647.18, despite falling to its lowest level in
two months during the opening slide.
</P>
<P>
Decliners outnumbered advancers by a 9-to-7 margin on the New
York Stock Exchange, where column was heavy at 692.90 million
shares, down slightly from Friday's 746.42 million, the fourth
biggest tally in NYSE history.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 11.52 to 939.21 after
wiping out an early 15-point deficit, and the Nasdaq composite
index rose 4.37 to 1,507.59 after recovering from an early
36-point slide.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index rose 4.14 to 491.61, but the
small-company dominated American Stock Exchange composite index
fell 3.83 to 646.41.
</P>
<P>
Technology shares, which are considered especially vulnerable
to the economic trouble in Asia, were instrumental in the
turnaround. Intel, which is due to report on its latest results
after Tuesday's close, rose sharply to lead the rebound on the
technology-heavy Nasdaq market, which briefly fell to its lowest
level since the October selloff.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's main stock index sank 8.7 percent today. Share
prices also fell in Singapore, Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia and
Australia, but rose in two of the region's most troubled nations:
Indonesia and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
European markets were pulled lower, too, but some recovered
partially after Wall Street's turnaround.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Down on Asian Turmoil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe,
undermined by the continuing turmoil in Asian markets, sharply
downed Monday and all ended with big losses.
</P>
<P>
Britain's FTSE 100 index was at its worst level falling by
almost three percent and the market saw 26 billion pounds (42
billion U.S. dollars) wiped from the value of its shares as Asian
flu took hold again.
</P>
<P>
But the market clambered back from session lows as Wall Street
staged a recovery from fierce early losses, with the index ending
at 5,068.8, down 69.5 points or 1.35 percent.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that markets were still fragile in the wake of
deepening Asian economic woes.
</P>
<P>
The DAX-30 index in Frankfurt had been more than four percent
lower earlier today before closing at 4,087.28, down 149.66 points
or 3.53 percent.
</P>
<P>
The market was in a "tailspin" because of the heavy losses in
Asia, one dealer said.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the CAC-30 index suffered its fifth consecutive
session of losses, as nervous investors dumped stocks after the
latest relapse on Asian bourses.
</P>
<P>
But the index managed to bounce off lows to close down 57.27 at
2,862.54 points.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Emphasizes Cooperation, Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 12 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said today that the world body faces the challenge of
reviving the political will for international cooperation and
development.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at the ceremonial handover of the
chairmanship of the Group of 77.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's Foreign Minister Ali Alatas formally took over the
annual post for 1998 from Tazania's Foreign Minister Jakaya M.
Kikwete.
</P>
<P>
Annan said his reform programs, which will enhance U.N.
effectiveness in the field of development, could not be made
possible without the steadfast cooperation and strong support of
the Group of 77.
</P>
<P>
The Group of 77 and the U.N. "walk side by side" and "share the
common understanding" of promoting development, he said.
</P>
<P>
Outlining the progress of U.N. reforms, Annan mentioned the
establishment of a new office for development financing, the
freed-up resources to create a "development dividend" and the
greater opportunity for U. N. Conference on Trade and Development
to contribute to deliberations at U.N. Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly' (G.A.)s 52nd session successfully
launched an intergovernmental dialogue on development financing
and the G.A.'s Second Committee reaffirmed a proposal for renewing
the dialogue on international cooperation for development, he said.
</P>
<P>
The recent turmoil in financial markets has demonstrated "the
need for effective multilateralism and a strong United Nations,"
the U.N. chief added.
</P>
<P>
Created on June 15, 1964 and linked with the U.N. system, the
Group of 77 is the world's largest single grouping of developing
countries.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, France to Complement Peace-Saving Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 12 (Xinhua) -- Visiting French Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine and Jordan's top leaders reached a consensus here
Monday to complement international efforts to save the stalled
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
This was announced at a joint press conference by Vedrine and
his Jordanian counterpart Fayez Tarawneh following their meeting
Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The French minister, who arrived here earlier from Beirut as
part of his Middle East tour, had also held separate talks with
King Hussein, Crown Prince Hassan and Prime Minister Abdul-Salam
Majali.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine said he did not bring a French initiative, but France
would rather work together with all the European Union countries
and the international community, especially the U.S., to remove
the obstacles to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said France is committed to working with other countries to
find a comprehensive, just and lasting peace for the region, and
it appreciates the efforts made by King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Both Vedrine and Tarawneh described the French minister's visit
to Jordan as useful, positive and productive.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Vedrine signed an agreement with the
Jordanian side to grant the kingdom 80 million French francs
(about 13.6 million U.S. dollars) in financial aid.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian side praised France's efforts in alleviating the
sufferings of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Majali said there is great prospect for further
cooperation between Jordan and France in all fields, particularly
in investment and economic areas.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine left here for Syria soon after the press conference.

<HEADLINE> Britain Calls on U.S. to Take More Flexible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook, who is due to hold talks with American Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright Thursday, will call on the U.S. government to
adopt a more flexible approach towards Iran, a government official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The official told reporters that Cook will stress that
Washington and the European Union (EU) need new policies to take
advantage of the more conciliatory Iranian approach.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Iranian President Mohammad Khatami said
last week that contacts between academics, writers, journalists
and tourists could help improve the bilateral relations with the
United States after two decades of hostility between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The official said: "In the British view, unilateral U.S.
sanctions (against Iran) will not work. We need to devise new ways
of engaging this important country at a critical time."
</P>
<P>
"Like the U.S. administration, we believe it's right to try to
capitalize on the new tone. We must try to encourage Iranian
moderates," the official said.
</P>
<P>
However, the official said that there could be no question of
relaxing rules designed to prevent Iran from acquiring weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
"We need tough policies to counter Iranian efforts to acquire
weapons of mass destruction," he added.

<P>
CAIRO, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The Following are business briefs
from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt has reached an agreement with Sudan to export
to its southern neighbor 5 million U.S. dollars worth of steel,
the Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported Monday.

jewelry industry are in danger, the local newspaper Beirut Times
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
A reduction of custom duties of 2 percent on imported gold
products and the lower wages of foreign workers will lead to the
layoff of Lebanese workers, said Boghos Kurdian, head of the
Syndicate of Master Goldsmiths and Jewelers.
</P>
<P>
He added that many business owners have employed foreign
workers, mainly from Thailand, because they get much lower pay
than Lebanese workers.
</P>
<P>
He called on the government to intervene by putting an
immediate end to the rising number of foreign workers and
consider protective measures.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- British Petroleum, the world's third largest oil
company, has started business in Lebanon, the local newspaper
Daily Star reported Sunday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Rybkin on Russian-Chechen Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 12 (Xinhua) -- The main achievement made by the
Russian Security Council was establishment of peace in Chechnya
and adoption of a concept of national security, Head of the
Russian Security Council Ivan Rybkin said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with members of the international Committee
"Conference of the Den Bourg Fund" Rybkin said the best preventive
measure as regards Chechnya was the implementation of an economic
agreement signed on May 12, 1997, and around 40 other agreements
concluded by Russian ministries and departments with Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
He meanwhile noted the Russian government was not doing enough
for the realization of these agreements.
</P>
<P>
Russian Vice Premier Ramazan Abdulatipov visited last Saturday
to Grozny, capital of the break-way republic, that made the first
step towards realization of these agreements, Rybkin was quoted as
reporting.
</P>
<P>
In Rybkin's opinion, a legal basis for relations between Moscow
and Grozny already exists and now, concrete ways should be found
for realization of this basis.
</P>
<P>
The International Consultative Committee incorporates
representatives of state, public, religious structures of Russia,
the United States, Great Britain, the Netherlands and the
Conference of European Churches.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Iraq should not Choose U.N. Inspectors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 12 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton said
on Monday that Iraq had no right to pick and choose U.N. weapons
inspectors to carry out their job of dismantling weapons of mass
destruction in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Saddam Hussein shouldn't be able to pick and choose who does
this work," Clinton told reporters at the White House. "If they
are denied their right to do their job tomorrow then I expect the
United Nations Security Council to take strong and appropriate
action."
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, Iraq announced through its news agency INA
that it decided to halt the work of the inspection team headed by
American Scott Ritter and has withdrawn permission for him to
undertake any activities inside the Iraq until the composition of
the team has balanced participation from the permanent members of
the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has previously accused Ritter of spying for the United
States. But Ritter has denied the charge, saying the allegation
was "absolutely untrue."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iraqi's U.N. ambassador Nizar Hamdoon said the team,
led by Ritter, was composed of nine American nationals, five
British nationals, one Russian and one Australian, which he said
was "unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
But Clinton said the United States had nothing to do with the
composition of ritter's team.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, an official of the U.S. National Security Council said
that Iraq's complaints about the balance of team members were
"spurious and irrelevant," and said Iraq could not "pick and
choose" who will inspect its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The official also said Ritter "is not a spy. He is a
professional member of the UNSCOM team. He has inspected Iraq
before. He is not a representative of the United States."
</P>
<P>
The official expected the U.N. Security Council to review the
event and "make clear that Iraq must reverse its position."
