   NEW YORK _ With costumes and set by the author and artist
Maurice Sendak, the Pilobolus Dance Theater returns to the Joyce
Theater on Monday night to introduce ``A Selection,'' a darkly
theatrical work for the company's six performers.
</P>
<P>
   Its narrative, created in part by Sendak, tells of a troupe of
performers who miss the last available train out of Nazi Germany.
Dedicated to Primo Levi, the Italian scientist and author, who
survived Auschwitz, the work is set to music by the Czech composers
Hans Krasa and Pavel Haas, both of whom died in concentration
camps.

<P>
   Along with the playful trio ``Un, Dos, Tray'' and the solo
``Femme Noire,'' ``A Selection'' is one of three New York premieres
among 13 dances spanning 25 years to be presented by Pilobolus in
its engagement through July 31. Information: (212) 242-0800.

FEDERAL SEERS, TELLING NATION'S FISCAL FORTUNE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kathy Gramp peered beneath the stacks of paper on
her desk and poked through the drawers, an expression of bafflement
on her face. Her calculator was at large.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's here somewhere,'' she insisted, rolling her eyes. She
seemed to appreciate the strangeness of this particular piece of
equipment vanishing, given her job. Ms. Gramp is one of the workers
at the Congressional Budget Office who crunch the numbers that tell
the country's financial fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Ms. Gramp, who refers to herself as ``chatty Kathy''
and points to the strands beneath her headband when she mentions
``senior, gray-haired analysts,'' tries not to take her task, or
herself, too seriously.
</P>
<P>
   On a wall just outside her office, she and her colleagues have
hung various symbols and objects that they jokingly refer to as the
real tools of their predictive trade. There is a Ouija board, a
crystal ball, a bag of tea leaves, a pair of dice and,
incongruously, a plastic replica of a breakfast food.
</P>
<P>
   ``A waffle,'' Ms. Gramp explained. ``We waffle.''
</P>
<P>
   That is true only to a point. But Ms. Gramp's comic riff
underscored a larger reality.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the lofty, quasi-mystical budget numbers that
sporadically rise from the nation's capital sit scores of everyday
people like Ms. Gramp _ scattered, self-effacing and fully aware of
the intrinsic, inevitable flaws in their convoluted guessing game.
</P>
<P>
   That game produced some especially startling results last week.
Revising calculations they had made earlier in the year, officials
at both the CBO and the White House's Office of Management and
Budget, which produces its own set of figures, announced that the
federal surplus over the next 10 years would, in fact, be hundreds
of billions of dollars larger than they had previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the total surplus over that period was projected to be
about $2.9 trillion, roughly $1 trillion of which was up for
legislative grabs.
</P>
<P>
   These numbers almost instantly altered the political landscape.
There were fresh hopes and refined designs for the long-term fiscal
survival of Social Security and Medicare. There was new momentum
for sweeping tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   And there were, for the confounded observer, several questions:
How did this happen, and who were the instigators?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gramp is one, although her piece of the pie is minuscule.
One of about 200 people employed by the budget office, she analyzes
and projects how much the federal government will spend each year
on an array of programs related to science, basing her estimates in
large part on the spending caps that Congress enacted in 1997 and
mathematical formulas that predict when the people who receive
federal grants are likely to actually cash those checks. (Believe
it or not, some wait a while.)
</P>
<P>
   To produce a complete portrait of federal expenditures in the
future, her figure joins comparable estimates from people who
specialize in other areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Deb _ she does national parks and wetlands and
endangered species,'' Ms. Gramp said one recent afternoon as she
navigated a warren of offices on the fourth floor of a building
relegated to a distant corner of Capitol Hill: a congressional
Siberia of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a transportation analyst behind you,'' Ms. Gramp added
as she rounded a corner.
</P>
<P>
   The other half of the puzzle is revenue, also known as taxes,
and that is where the indefatigable economy has produced income for
the federal government that has been exceeding expectations for the
last few years.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Kasten works in this area, and he does so somewhat
invisibly, which is a judgment not on his influence or personality
but on his desktop. Every square millimeter has a leaning tower of
paper rising from it, and the shortest tower is at least 2 feet
tall. Only the top of Kasten's scalp can be seen from the door of
his office.
</P>
<P>
   Kasten has a doctorate in economics from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, but he concedes that his job has as much
to do with arithmetic as with abstruse economic theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you need for this,'' Kasten explained, ``is a little bit
of economic training, a lot of common sense and something like an
instinct for numbers, so you can spot new trends.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of what Kasten does _ and what is done by the economic
forecasters in the CBO and the OMB, who provide the template for
him and other players in this process _ is extrapolate from the
present into the future, using history as a guide and making
informed judgments about changes on the horizon to tweak that model
and amend their calculations.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph Penner, a former director of the Congressional Budget
Office, explained: ``I might look at what these equations tell me,
but I might stare at an equation and say, `Well, we've never had a
stock market like the one we're having now.' I'm going to adjust
the results. I'm going to assume that consumption will be a little
higher.' That's a judgment. That's where the art comes in.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The further that analysts gaze into the future, the faultier
their assumptions are bound to be; they cannot, for starters,
anticipate new legislation that may affect the economy, tax
revenues and expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Reischauer, another former director of the budget office,
said that a 10-year projection ``is our best judgment of where we
will end up if we remain on automatic pilot.''
</P>
<P>
   But Reischauer added, ``Our whole political system is designed
to fly the plane, not to allow it to continue on automatic pilot.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, there are the unexpected pockets of turbulence.
Lately, they have been happy spasms. For example, in early 1994,
the OMB projected a federal budget deficit for 1998 of $190.5
billion. Instead, the federal government had a $69 billion surplus.
</P>
<P>
   What went wrong _ or, rather, right? Joseph Minarik, the chief
economist for the OMB, explained that additional revenue was
brought in by an unexpectedly surging economy, a dizzying stock
market and ``the power of compound interest.'' On top of all that,
the federal government tightened its spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future is uncertain,'' Minarik said with a smile and a
shrug. ``I cannot quarrel with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Minarik, who once worked as a tax analyst for the Congressional
Budget Office, has a doctorate in economics from Yale. But
economics degrees are not prerequisites for peering into the fiscal
future.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Holland, who interprets the probable impact of economic
forecasts on the federal budget for the CBO, has a master's degree
in public policy from Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Much of his job, he said, boils down to numerical calculations,
but not the kind that require a supercomputer or other arcane
technology. He often works with Lotus software on a Dell computer,
and to break the occasional monotony, he plays rock music over the
speakers attached to the machine. The stack of compact discs on a
cabinet in his office include Aerosmith, Blondie and the
Pretenders.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gramp is just down the hall, in a section of the budget
office noted for its ersatz art gallery. For every kind of federal
outlay that the analysts there study, there is a corresponding
framed poster of a famous painting or print.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Van Gogh's ``Fishing Boats on the Beach at
Sainte-Marie-de-la-Mer'' represents federal expenditures on
fisheries and water transportation. Georgia O'Keefe's ``Cliffs
Beyond Abiqui'' symbolizes spending on public and Indian lands.
</P>
<P>
   Outlays for national disasters have no visual analogue. ``We're
still trying to find a good picture of a tsunami,'' Ms. Gramp said.

MAN CHARGED IN FATHER'S DEATH WANTED TO DIE TOO, OFFICIAL SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The 49-year-old man accused of killing his ailing
father in a Brooklyn hospital on Saturday _ before brutally
attacking his sister and his father's elderly hospital roommate _
told investigators that he had wanted to put his father out of his
misery and to die in the attempt, a law enforcement official said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Joseph Raineri Jr., told investigators that he had
attacked his father, who was suffering from cancer of the liver,
out of mercy, the official said. When it was done, according to the
official, Raineri said he had hoped to goad police into killing
him, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``His plan was to have the police shoot him,'' the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   The attack took place at Victory Memorial Hospital in the Dyker
Heights section of Brooklyn at noon on Saturday. Armed with a knife
and a hammer, Raineri went to visit his father, Joseph Raineri Sr.,
74, and slashed his throat, police said. Police said the young
Raineri then turned the knife on his sister, Linda Raineri, 46,
seriously wounding her, and after that, beat his father's roommate,
Michael D'Ambrose, 88, with the hammer.
</P>
<P>
   D'Ambrose _ who was mistakenly reported dead in some editions of
The New York Times on Sunday _ was in fact seriously injured, and
remained in very critical condition Sunday at Lutheran Medical
Center in Brooklyn, said Paul-Anthony Magadia, a hospital
administrator.
</P>
<P>
   A police spokesman who was asked about D'Ambrose's condition by
a New York Times reporter on Saturday evening said D'Ambrose had
died of his wounds at 6:40 p.m., police officials said Sunday. But
when the Police Department learned shortly after 9 p.m. that
D'Ambrose was still alive, though brain-dead, no one contacted The
Times with the corrected information, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The young Raineri, an unemployed taxi driver, lived with his
father and sister in a small second-floor apartment on 64th Street,
and had grown distraught over his father's deteriorating medical
condition, police said. After the attack, Raineri told
investigators that he believed that D'Ambrose had somehow been
bothering his father in the hospital, the law enforcement official
said.
</P>
<P>
   So after Raineri killed his father, the official said, he also
decided to attack D'Ambrose. The official said Raineri also told
investigators that he decided to attack his sister because he did
not approve of the way she lived her life.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, Raineri was awaiting arraignment on charges of
murder and attempted murder.

METS AVOID SWEEP, BEAT BRAVES, 7-6 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Mets were doing just about everything
they had not been able to do against the Atlanta Braves the three
previous times they met. The Mets had scored. They had even led.
And they were still three innings away from being swept at home
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets did not disappoint the holiday crowd of 32,699 at
Shea Stadium. They fought back. Edgardo Alfonzo smacked a three-run
home run off John Smoltz in the seventh inning to wipe out a
two-run deficit, and the Mets held on for a 7-6 victory over the
first-place Braves.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets took the final game of a three-game series despite Orel
Hershiser, their starter, having allowed four home runs. Two of
them came off the bat of Bret Boone, who narrowly missed a third.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo had narrowly missed a homer to straightaway center
earlier in the game. When he stepped to the plate with one out in
the seventh, the Mets were eight outs away from falling six games
back of the Braves. Rey Ordonez, who had singled to lead off the
inning, and Brian McRae, who had walked, were on second and third
after Rickey Henderson had sacrificed them there. Alfonzo is Mets
manager Bobby Valentine's favorite hitter with runners in scoring
position. Again, he showed why.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, Andruw Jones had crashed into the center-field
fence to rob Alfonzo of extra bases. This time, after Alfonzo
drilled a 93 mph fastball to the left of the 410 sign in
straightaway center, Jones leapt again, but to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz nearly walked into the Braves' dugout off of third base
as he watched the flight of the ball. He knew what was coming.
Atlanta manager Bobby Cox would soon be on his way to take him out.
</P>
<P>
   But it was too late. Dennis Cook tossed a scoreless eighth for
the Mets, and Armando Benitez, in his first save opportunity since
John Franco went on the disabled list Saturday, closed the victory
out by striking out Boone, Chipper Jones and Brian Jordan in a
perfect ninth.
</P>
<P>
   And the Mets were four games behind the Braves instead of six.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser had allowed consecutive 400-plus foot home runs to
Boone and Jones with one out in the first.
</P>
<P>
   It had been three games plus an inning since the Mets had scored
against Atlanta pitching. And with Smoltz, the National League's
leader in earned run average (3.03) facing them, the prospect of an
offensive outburst did not seem promising.
</P>
<P>
   But after the Braves took the 2-0 lead, the Mets put a rally
together in their first at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Rickey Henderson fouled off a pair of full-count pitches before
blooping a single to right that dropped in front of three Braves.
Alfonzo worked a full-count walk. John Olerud blasted a one-hop
infield single off Jones' glove at third. And the Mets had loaded
the bases for Mike Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza has been struggling with runners in scoring position.
Since May 15, he had been just 5 for 43, a miserable .116. But
Piazza took a ball and then ripped a line drive over second base
for a two-run single. The Mets had scored their first runs against
Atlanta in 29 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Ventura then surprisingly pushed a bunt up the third base
line. Jones barehanded the ball and easily threw Ventura out at
first. But Ventura was awarded a sacrifice, as Olerud and Piazza
moved to second and third. And when Benny Agbayani drove Olerud in
with a grounder to second, the Mets had a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser pitched a decent second after allowing a first-pitch
lead-off double to Randall Simon, who was eventually stranded at
third. And the Mets tacked on a two-out run in the bottom of the
second, when Henderson blooped another single to right, just inside
the line, and scored on Alfonzo's double to right center.
</P>
<P>
   But it soon became obvious that Hershiser had little on his
pitches in the heat. Boone, whose first homer had cleared the fence
in the back of the bullpen in left, opened the third with another
homer to cut the Mets' lead to 4-3. Jones then drew a walk. Alfonzo
did not get in front of a one-hop smash from Brian Jordan that was
scored as a single with Jones advancing to third. And Ryan Klesko
lofted a sacrifice fly to center to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser struck out Andruw Jones on a sinker. But Hershiser
left his first pitch to Simon up. And Simon, who had missed a home
run by a matter of feet in the second, did not miss this time. His
two-run drive landed near the base of the scoreboard in right for a
6-4 Braves lead.
</P>
<P>
   Two pitches later, Hershiser hit Eddie Perez on the left
shoulder with a change-up. Perez started to make his way to the
mound as Hershiser apparently explained that he was not trying to
hit him. That made sense. The 40-year-old right-hander did not hit
too many spots Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets survived Hershiser's problems. Alfonzo saw to that.

GEOFF LAWSON, 54, DESIGNER WHO UPDATED JAGUAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Geoff Lawson, an Englishman whose designs of recent Jaguar
automobiles displayed sensuous, feline grace and elegant British
refinement, but whose personal style reflected his rebellious
nature and a love of American hot rods and handguns, died on June
24 in Coventry, England. He was 54.
</P>
<P>
   Lawson was styling director of Jaguar Cars, the British luxury
automaker owned by Ford Motor Co. He had just finished a
presentation at Jaguar's Whitley Engineering Center when he said
that he did not feel well. He was taken to a Coventry hospital
where he died of a stroke, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   As the designer responsible for several of Jaguar's recent,
successful models, including the soft, sultry XJ8 sedan, the sexy
XK8 coupe and convertible, the evocative new S-Type sedan and a
still-unseen small car, the X400, Lawson played a significant role
in the commercial revival of the company, which in the last decade
went from basket case to record sales and a newfound reputation for
good quality.
</P>
<P>
   Lawson became styling director in 1984, at a time when Jaguar
was hemorrhaging money. Its reputation for excellence in design and
manufacturing was fading after decades of neglect. The company was
humbled into accepting a rescue by Ford in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Through these turbulent times, Lawson was the keeper of the
Jaguar flame, colleagues said, making improvements in designs
inherited from a period when British Leyland owned Jaguar, and then
under the Ford umbrella, introducing new designs, all with panache,
skill and not a little rebelliousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``His great gift was the ability to recognize the importance of
classic styling cues from the great Jaguars of the past and then
translate them into modern Jaguars in a new and contemporary
fashion,'' said Wolfgang Reitzle, the chairman of Jaguar.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he famously referred to his cars' look as Jaguar's
``DNA,'' a term that other automakers quickly borrowed and turned
into a cliche to sum up the more mundane characteristics of their
brands.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lawson spent his entire career in the auto industry,
his training was as a furniture designer. He was born in Leicester,
a red-brick industrial town in the East Midlands of England, and
studied at the local art school. His subsequent master's degree in
furniture design at London's Royal College of Art included a thesis
on American cars.
</P>
<P>
   He joined Vauxhall Motors, General Motors Corp.'s British
subsidiary, in 1969, and later worked on GM car and truck programs
in Europe and the United States before joining Jaguar.
</P>
<P>
   Lawson is survived by his wife, Jill; a son, Adam; a daughter,
Verity, and his father, Harry.
</P>
<P>
   Lawson was an unreconstructed car enthusiast, though it seems
odd that the man who created quintessentially British products was
an unashamed lover of the rougher-edged cars and trucks of North
America. That included ownership of a flame-red 1969 Chevrolet
Corvette _ complete with a 427-cubic-inch engine _ in which he
regularly commuted to Whitley from his home in Napton-on-the-Hill,
Warwickshire.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, his admiration of Americana included not only hot rods,
but a collection of Fender Stratocaster and Gibson Les Paul
electric guitars _ reflecting his love of rock 'n' roll and blues
music _ and handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dover, now chairman of Aston Martin and a former chief
program engineer at Jaguar, said Lawson had an extensive collection
of real and fake guns in his office. ``There's a red exit sign in
his studios which bears the marks of some target practice with an
air pistol,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Lawson's funeral on Thursday in the small English town of
Southam, his Jaguar colleagues wore loud, garish ties _ the kind,
they said, that Lawson always wore, and that reflected his
ebullient personality.

   They can do no wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Women's World Cup team can show up for huge games like
Sunday's semifinal with dead legs and mental fatigue and still hold
up its end of the bargain.
</P>
<P>
   What bargain is that?
</P>
<P>
   Well, only to carry the world's largest-ever women's sporting
event on their shoulders and, while they're at it, to keep their
composure and natural good looks intact while the audience grows
bigger and more intrigued each step of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is history in the making,'' Mia Hamm said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are bigger things happening here than just us winning a
game.''
</P>
<P>
   You get the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the home team may not have been extraordinarily skilled
or superlatively organized, but it was just a tad less tired than
Brazil, so there you go. That was a big enough advantage,
especially on the Fourth of July.
</P>
<P>
   America loves a party, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   The United States won 2-0. The dread of the deadly semifinal _
where the U.S. women were eliminated in the 1995 Women's World Cup
in Sweden _ is over with.
</P>
<P>
   And afterward, someone asked U.S. goalkeeper Briana Scurry what
was her immediate reaction to the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Excitement? Exhaustion? Relief?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Scurry said with a smile, meaning she was all of the
above and perhaps more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to be in the final and it's going to be great to
have five days to recuperate.''
</P>
<P>
   It was tough to tell if the U.S. women's big date next Saturday
at the Rose Bowl or the five days of rest, massages and California
sun were making Scurry smile so wide.
</P>
<P>
   But at least the women have arrived at their promised land, even
if Sunday's effort won't be the subject of any tear-jerking,
awe-inspiring highlight films.
</P>
<P>
   The United States reversed a trend of early game ineffectiveness
and scored a goal on Cindy Parlow's header just five minutes into
the match before it was clear that neither the Americans nor the
Brazilians had fared too well in their cross-country travels.
</P>
<P>
   The jittery and usually artistic feet of the Brazilians were
slowed to a fox trot, especially in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the smatterings of yellow-shirted Brazilian fans _ ever
moving and dancing to drums and samba beats in the packed Stanford
Stadium stands _ could cajole any extra juice from the fleet and
dangerous Brazilian players named Tania and Katia, Pretinha and
even star striker, Sissi.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the 73,123 spectators (12,000 of whom bought tickets
between Friday and Sunday's 1:30 p.m. kickoff) who took their place
in Hamm's history lesson were not deterred by the obvious lack of
fresh legs in this game.
</P>
<P>
   Not even Hamm, the darling of this tournament, could muster a
rush to the goal that resulted in any pyrotechnics _ as she had as
if on cue during the United States' made-for-TV opener two weeks
ago at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm's drives all died deep in the box Sunday, as the crowd
sighed and hoped out loud. But Hamm was caught trying one too many
spins or cuts before being tackled or knocked off the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Only once did Hamm work up a dramatic offensive rush _ and that
one ended with Hamm being upended by Brazil's Elane, creating the
penalty kick that Michelle Akers so deliberately knocked into the
back of Brazil's net.
</P>
<P>
   Even that goal was created by the match's overall fatigue
factor.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. coach Tony DiCicco had noticed that Brazil's Juliana was
not keeping pace with Hamm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew she was falling off so if we could get behind her, Mia
would have a chance to go one-on-one with Elane,'' DiCicco said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll have to look at the tape to see about that foul, but to
us, it looked like a foul and frankly, those are the types of
situations where you're going to get those types of calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Akers' goal on the penalty kick in the 80th minute sealed
the U.S. win _ and the United States players did not hesitate in
accepting that not all of their achievements have to be as pretty
as, well, them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most nerve-racking game, the semifinal. We were a
tired team,'' Hamm said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the perky crowd empathized with the fact that both
Brazil and the United States had each battled in tough quarterfinal
matches just three days earlier _ three time zones away.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was pounded by Germany on Thursday night and
Brazil was dogged by Nigeria in games in Washington, D.C., where
the president was on hand and during which sports talk radio jocks
(mostly male) across the country confessed they were getting
seriously caught up in World Cup fever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of the game, it's a long tournament and you're going
to have a game like this,'' Shannon MacMillan said.
</P>
<P>
   With that, the team has all but pledged that things will be
different during the championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play our best game for 90 minutes,'' Akers said.
</P>
<P>
   But for a team that has given the summer and the sporting
landscape such a feeling of freshness and beauty, it earned the
right to just gut one out.

GUY MITCHELL, 72, POP CROONER OF THE '50S 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Nev., Mich., Calif., Idaho, Wash.)  (lb) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Guy Mitchell, the jocular pop crooner of lightweight songs who
epitomized the clean-cut boy next door in the early 1950s, died on
Thursday at Desert Springs Hospital in Las Vegas. He was 72 and
lived in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications following surgery, said his wife,
Betty Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1950 and 1960 Mitchell had nearly 40 hit records, most
of them novelties, folk tunes and country songs, all under the
aegis of the Columbia Records producer Mitch Miller. In 1956
Mitchell's cover version of Marty Robbins' country hit ``Singing
the Blues'' was the No. 1 pop single for a near record-breaking 10
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The son of immigrants from Yugoslavia, Mitchell was born Al
Cernick in Detroit. When he was 11, his family moved to Los Angeles
where he auditioned for Warner Bros.; the company groomed him to be
a child star. But his film career was delayed when the family moved
to San Francisco, where Mitchell appeared regularly on the radio
shows of Dude Martin, a country singer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947 he became a vocalist with Carmen Cavallero's orchestra,
with which he made his first recordings for Decca. In 1949 he won
``Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts'' as a soloist. When Frank Sinatra
refused to record two songs for Columbia Records while the band was
waiting in the studio, Miller, who had heard Mitchell sing on
demonstration records, called him in as a last-minute substitute.
</P>
<P>
   Those two songs, ``My Heart Cries for You'' (a soupy adaptation
of an 18th-century French ballad, ``Chanson de Marie-Antoinette'')
and ``The Roving Kind'' (an adaptation of an English folk song,
``The Pirate Ship,'' that had previously been recorded by the
Weavers) became back-to-back Top 5 hits.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to enjoy a succession of jaunty hits, including
``Sparrow in the Treetop,'' ``My Truly, Truly Fair,'' ``Belle,
Belle, My Liberty Belle,'' ``Pittsburgh, Pa.,'' and ``Feet Up (Pat
Him on the Po-Po''), clever pseudo-folk novelties by Bob Merrill,
who had invented the subgenre with the Patti Page hit ``(How Much
Is That) Doggie in the Window?''
</P>
<P>
   As rock 'n' roll stampeded onto the charts in the mid-1950s,
Mitchell's moment seemed to be over. But by shifting the emphasis
from novelties to country songs, Mitchell enjoyed a second wind
with ``Singing the Blues,'' ``Rock-a-Billy'' (a stiff tribute to
the Memphis country-rock sound), and a second and final No. 1 hit,
``Heartaches by the Number,'' a cover version of Ray Price's
country hit.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, Joseph
Stanzak of Twin Falls, Idaho, and David Stanzak of Spokane, Wash.,
and five grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell also worked as a movie actor. He starred with Rhonda
Fleming, Gene Barry, Agnes Moorehead and Teresa Brewer in ``Those
Redheads From Seattle'' (1953), a comedy about the Gold Rush, and
with Rosemary Clooney and Jack Carson in ``Red Garters'' (1954), a
musical western spoof, and appeared in ``The Wild Westerners''
(1962).
</P>
<P>
   For three months in 1957 he was the host of a variety series,
``The Guy Mitchell Show'' on ABC. In the early 1960s he played a
detective, George Romack, in a short-lived NBC series, ``Whispering
Smith,'' starring Audie Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   After being dropped from Columbia Records in 1962, Mitchell
recorded sporadically for several labels and was a regular
performer on the nostalgia circuit.

A RECORD DAY FOR SPRINTERS IN STAKES AT BELMONT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ Temperatures soared but records fell at Belmont
Park on Sunday, as the two featured holiday races produced a stakes
record and a track record.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes record was set in the $150,000 Tom Fool Handicap by
Crafty Friend, a 6-year-old horse who had won just one race in each
of the last two years. This time he started fast and finished fast,
prevailing by three-quarters of a length over Affirmed Success, the
favorite, who had five lengths on Artax, the second favorite. And
he certainly confused the standing in racing's sprint division.
</P>
<P>
   The horses broke from the gate 1-2-3 and stayed in that
alignment: Crafty Friend guarding a thin lead for all seven
furlongs, with Affirmed Success at his heels and Artax stalking.
They flew the first quarter of a mile in 22 3/5 seconds, half a
mile in 44 4/5 and three-quarters in 1:08 flat. At the finish,
Crafty Friend, with Richard Migliore riding, had his biggest lead
of the race.
</P>
<P>
   He ran the seven-eighths of a mile in 1:20 3/5, two-fifths of a
second off the track record for the distance but one-fifth of a
second faster than the record for the race, set in 1978 by J.O.
Tobin and equaled in 1993 by Birdonthewire. He paid $10.80 for a $2
bet to win.
</P>
<P>
   John Kimmel, who began training Crafty Friend last spring after
Wally Dollase was relieved of the role by Thoroughbred Corp., has
turned the horse around. Since then, he ran first in an allowance,
second to Sir Bear in the Metropolitan Mile and first in the Tom
Fool on Sunday after passing up the Iselin Handicap at Monmouth
Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing was, he likes this track,'' Kimmel said. ``He
runs game when he's here. In the Met Mile, he got outrun in the
last sixteenth of a mile. My intuition said seven-eighths. He
showed he's a classy animal.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Affirmed Success, his trainer, Richie Schosberg, said,
``He gave a game effort but just didn't get the job done.'' Jorge
Chavez, who rode the favorite, said: ``The heat may have hurt him a
little bit. I tried to stay close to the winner, but he was too
good.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ernie Paragallo, the owner of Artax, said, ``He was in
perfect striking position, but just didn't fire.''
</P>
<P>
   A Very Fast 2-Year-Old
</P>
<P>
   Record speed was also flashed in Sunday's other stakes at
Belmont, the Tremont, a sprint won in the past by such stars as Man
o' War, Buckpasser, Hansel, Alydar and Kelly Kip.
</P>
<P>
   The track record for five and a half furlongs was set at 1:03 by
Raise A Cup in 1973 and later equaled by Ruffian in 1975 and Salt
Lake in 1991. Now add the name of More Than Ready to this roster of
superfast 2-year-olds. He not only won the Tremont on Sunday but
also broke the record when he flashed the distance in 1:02 2/5
after leading all the way and showing an awesome burst of speed in
the homestretch.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he is 3, More Than Ready will be more than ready. He
made an early debut in April and won; he raced again in May and
June and won. And with his victory on Sunday, he made it 4 for 4
with half his juvenile year to go. He is owned by James
Scatuorichio and trained by Todd Pletcher, who said the Saratoga
series was next on his target list.
</P>
<P>
   With John Velazquez riding, More Than Ready finished 4{ widening
lengths in front of Afternoon Affair, who had nearly six lengths on
King Kokand. He paid $3 for a $2 bet to win, earned $65,040 and
faced Saratoga with a perfect record.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a fighter,'' Pletcher said. ``He was just on cruise
control today. We've spaced his races about a month apart. Our plan
has been to have him ready for the Sanford on July 29 or the
Saratoga Special on August 18 and ultimately the Hopeful on
September 4.''
</P>
<P>
   Frisk Me Now Triumphs
</P>
<P>
   Frisk Me Now, racing for the 36th time in a busy and successful
career, won for the 12th time when he prevailed Sunday in a
homestretch duel in the $350,000 Philip H. Iselin Handicap at
Monmouth Park in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-year-old bay, owned by Carol Dender and trained by her
husband, Bob Durso, outran Call Me Mr. Vain and Black Cash, while
the favored Littlebitlively finished out of the money.

FORMER KGB HEAD DIES AT 76 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Viktor Chebrikov, who led the Soviet KGB through much
of its final tumultuous confrontation with the West in the 1980s,
died unexpectedly on July 1, the intelligence service's successor,
the Federal Security Service, reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Chebrikov was 76 years old. The service did not disclose a cause
of death.
</P>
<P>
   He was chairman of the Committee on State Security, as the KGB
was formally known, from 1982 to 1988, and held the organization's
rank of general. The Soviet Union was struggling hardest against
irreversible decline in those years, and President Ronald Reagan
was pressing proxy wars against Moscow in Nicaragua and
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   As KGB chairman and a member of the Soviet Politburo, Chebrikov
played a crucial role in conducting the war in Afghanistan, where
the Soviet army's costly defeat emboldened domestic critics and
helped hasten the end of Soviet communism.
</P>
<P>
   He retired as KGB chief in October 1988, not long before the
last Soviet soldier left Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that black mark, however, Chebrikov's tenure is
undoubtedly best known for his agency's spectacular success in
lifting some of the most closely held secrets in all U.S.
intelligence _ led by the complete roster of Americans and Russians
who were working for the CIA inside the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   It was Chebrikov's KGB that found and nurtured Aldrich Ames, the
CIA employee who volunteered his services to the KGB in the
mid-1980s and who handed the Soviets the American playbook for
espionage there in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   The KGB quickly arrested and executed at least a dozen Soviet
citizens on the lists Ames supplied, throwing U.S. intelligence
into confusion for much of the last half of the decade. The Soviets
publicly teased the Americans about their losses, once publishing a
dramatic newspaper article documenting the unmasking of one such
agent, code-named Top Hat, who had given the Americans crucial
intelligence as far back as the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   They also appear to have misled the Americans skillfully about
the existence of a traitor in their midst by using deception _ and
perhaps even sacrificing some of their less valued American assets
_ to throw U.S. counterintelligence off the trail.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, American experts still debate whether a senior KGB
official who defected to the United States in 1985, Vitaly
Yurchenko, was a genuine defector or a KGB plant sent to mask Ames'
role. Yurchenko put the CIA on the trail of at least two Americans
who were working for Soviet intelligence during his debriefings in
suburban Washington, and also assured the agency that the KGB had
not penetrated CIA headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Yurchenko redefected to the Soviet side weeks later, saying that
the CIA had drugged and mistreated him during a period of forced
captivity.
</P>
<P>
   The senior intelligence official in the Reagan White House
during most of Chebrikov's tenure, Kenneth deGraffenreid, said
Sunday that he knew Chebrikov only from a distance as ``a
successful apparatchik who had gotten to the top.''
</P>
<P>
   But in retrospect, he said, ``One has to say that this was the
heyday of the KGB in terms of foreign intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of intelligence production _ spies, and dishing the
Americans on the secrets _ they were going strong right up to the
end,'' said deGraffenreid, senior director of intelligence programs
from 1981 to 1987. ``We uncovered 80 spies during those years.
These guys were on the make, and there was no question about their
influence.''
</P>
<P>
   Viktor Mikhailovich Chebrikov was born in Dnepropetrovsk, an
industrial city in eastern Ukraine, in 1923. After finishing
military school in 1942, he served in World War II as a battalion
commander, and then returned to Dnepropetrovsk to complete his
education at a metallurgical institute. He held a long series of
minor party posts in Ukraine before moving to run personnel
operations for the Communist Party Central Committee in 1967. He
was deputy chairman of the KGB from 1968 to 1982.
</P>
<P>
   His death was little noted in Moscow. The news service Interfax
ran a two-sentence death announcement, and three of Moscow's many
newspapers published a brief memorial from the Federal Security
Service without comment.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a subsequent KGB
chairman, Leonid Shebarshin, as saying that Chebrikov was ``a man,
with a capital letter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Come to the cemetery and you will see that not only his
friends will come there, but his ideological opponents,'' he said.
``What can be more important?''

   STANFORD, Calif. _ Those hoping to purchase Women's World Cup
tickets for Saturday's U.S.-China championship match at the Rose
Bowl better hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Tournament organizers announced that more than 70,000 tickets
have been sold for the doubleheader, which include's a third-place
match between Norway and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   With the U.S. clinching a championship berth Sunday, Women's
World Cup president Marla Messing expects the remaining tickets for
the 92,000-seat stadium to be sold out early in the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were always optimistic that we could sell out the Rose Bowl
if the U.S. reached the final,'' said Messing. ``With our total
over 70,000, it is very realistic to expect that game will be sold
out now.''

JOHNSON TO PLAYERS: AVOID BLAME GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Manager Davey Johnson emerged Sunday after a
one-hour meeting in the Los Angeles Dodgers clubhouse with a
message: Point fingers and they might get broken.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, whose laid-back approach has not brought the expected
results from his slumping team, was looking for a change. He has
held few meetings this season, most of them encouraging player
input.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, a day after his team dropped 10 games under .500 for the
first time since 1992, Johnson had the floor. He didn't detail the
minutes of the meeting, but his point was clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a guy messes up, we have to pick him up, not bury him,''
Johnson said. ``That's the media's job.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson doesn't read the papers, a lesson he learned managing
the New York Mets for 6{ seasons. Johnson said the idea for a
meeting came to him when he awoke at 2 a.m. Sunday. He sensed the
frustration of falling 9{ games behind San Francisco in the
National League West has hurt the players' concentration.
</P>
<P>
   __ On the mend: Mark Grudzielanek is in a hurry to get back and
help the slumping Dodgers. But the shortstop, disabled since June 1
with a broken right hand, continued his rehab assignment with
Single-A San Bernardino, going 2 for 4 Sunday against the Lancaster
JetHawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been killing me the last five weeks knowing I'm part of
(the Dodgers) but also knowing there's nothing I can do to help out
or even take part of the blame,'' said Grudzielanek, who is 3 for
14 in three rehab games and could remain in San Bernardino for a
couple of days more.
</P>
<P>
   __ Quick hits: Raul Mondesi left Sunday night's game after six
innings with tightness in his right leg. Mondesi, who went 0 for 3
with two strikeouts after going 3 for 3 on Saturday, was replaced

Night crowd of 54,731 was the seventh-largest regular season crowd
in Dodger Stadium history. . . . Despite the sellout, the game was
not televised because it was played during the window reserved for
ESPN's ``Sunday Night Baseball.'' It was just the eighth Dodgers
game not televised this season. When the Dodgers came to Los
Angeles in the late 1950s, they only televised the nine games
played in San Francisco.

MICHAEL HOOKER, 53, UNIVERSITY CHANCELLOR

<P>
   Michael Hooker, the chancellor of the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill who took a high-technology,
community-oriented approach to higher education, died last Tuesday
at UNC Hospitals. He was 53 and lived in Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, the
university said.
</P>
<P>
   Taking up the reins at his alma mater in 1995 as its eighth
chancellor, Hooker made computer literacy and close ties to the
state's citizenry the hallmarks of his administration. He promoted
an initiative to require all freshmen to have laptop computers for
their academic work next year, as well as a pledge to ensure that
that the university served the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only one reason to have a public university, and that
is to serve the people of the state,'' Hooker stated as his creed.
``That should be the touchstone of everything we do: whether it's
in the interest of North Carolina and our citizens. Our litmus test
is the question: Is what we do in Chapel Hill helping the factory
worker in Kannapolis?''
</P>
<P>
   Under Hooker's technology program, the school of education's Web
site offered free links to public school systems in the state.
Teachers and educators from all of North Carolina's 117 school
districts were trained on the site to use its database of lesson
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Under his guidance, Internet-based courses were introduced at
the undergraduate and graduate levels to make the university more
accessible to state residents.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kenneth Hooker was born in Richlands, Va., the son of a
coal miner, and was the first of his family to graduate from
college. He received a master's degree in 1972 and a doctorate in
philosophy in 1973 from the University of Massachusetts, and then
started teaching at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   Hooker went to Johns Hopkins University as an assistant
professor in philosophy in 1975 and successively served as
assistant dean, associate dean and dean until 1982, when he was
named president of Bennington College. He was president of the
University of Maryland at Baltimore County from 1986 to 1992, and
president of the University of Massachusetts system from 1992 until
his return to Chapel Hill three years later.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote scholarly articles on medical ethics and edited
``Descartes: Critical and Interpretive Essays'' (1978) and
``Leibniz: Critical and Interpretive Essays'' (1982).
</P>
<P>
   Hooker's marriage to Anna Hostettler Burns of Baltimore ended in
divorce. He is survived by his wife, Carmen; a daughter from his
earlier marriage, Alexandra Hooker of Baltimore; his mother,
Christine Hooker of Roanoke, Va., and his wife's two daughters,
Jennifer and Cyndi Buell of Charlotte, N.C.

 Rookie Halama throws fine nine in blanking Rangers  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ It's never easy with the Mariners, and Sunday
night was no different. John Halama got two quick outs in the ninth
inning, but then came a double. A walk. A hit by pitch. And a visit
from manager Lou Piniella.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was down to his last hitter,'' Piniella said of his rookie
left-hander. ``But he pitched so well that he deserved the
opportunity to pitch a complete game and a shutout.''
</P>
<P>
   Halama took advantage of that chance. He got Lee Stevens on a
groundout to second on the next pitch, securing a 6-0 victory over
the Texas Rangers and bringing the M's within five games of the
division leaders. The largest regular-season crowd in the history
of The Ballpark in Arlington _ 47,204 _ had to wait until the
post-game fireworks show to have any fun.
</P>
<P>
   This night was all Halama's.
</P>
<P>
   ``That whole game went at his pace,'' said veteran starter Jamie
Moyer. ``He didn't only have command of his pitches, he had command
of the game. As a pitcher, that's exactly what you want, that total
control of the game. We scored early and his attitude was, `That's
it, boys. Jump on.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners have climbed aboard ever since Halama joined the
rotation, winning seven of his eight starts. Halama is 5-0 with a
2.91 earned-run average as a starter, and Sunday's effort was the
Mariners' first shutout and complete game since last September,
when Moyer blanked Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   For Halama, the win was hard-earned. He had thrown nine innings
in Oakland Monday, allowing one run but getting a no-decision. It
was 87 degrees at game time, and there are easier places to match a
career-high 126 pitches than Texas. Piniella said he'll scale back
Halama in his next start, scheduled for Saturday in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm out of gas,'' Halama said. ``I have like nothing. The heat
just kicks you.''
</P>
<P>
   But the exhaustion couldn't keep Halama (7-2) from smiling
afterward, or pumping his fist slightly after the final out. He was
humble, as usual _ ``I'm not going to dominate a team,'' he said _
but acknowledged he did want to finish what he started.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very determined,'' said Halama, who will send the game
ball home to his parents in Brooklyn. ``I wanted it, I would say
just as much as my teammates wanted me to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   No teammate showed that more than Charles Gipson. The rookie
came in for defense in the eighth inning, and turned a single _ and
potential two-on, no-out situation _ into a fielder's choice by
throwing out Stevens at second.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with two outs and two on in the ninth, Gipson dodged a
fleeing ball boy and dove head-first across the chalk line for a
foul ball. He didn't get the ball, but did tear his pants and
bloody his leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to go hard for him,'' Gipson said of Halama. ``It
was 6-0, he was going for a complete game, and here in Arlington,
with the guys they have, you give them chances and they can come
back on you.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the Mariners who came back on the Rangers this series,
storming from seven runs down to win Saturday and overcoming two
deficits before losing on Friday. The M's trail Texas by the same
margin they did before the teams met at the Kingdome June 25, but
in taking four of six the last two weekends, Seattle has kept the
Rangers from running away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to play good ball and stay in the race, stay
close,'' said designated hitter Edgar Martinez. ``You never know
what's going to happen later. It's the end of the first half, and
if we play a lot better in the second half, we'll be in the race.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners did not have to come back Sunday. Alex Rodriguez
singled home David Bell in the first inning, and Martinez followed
with a three-run homer off the first pitch from veteran Mike Morgan
(9-6).
</P>
<P>
   Martinez came into the game having swung at the first pitch just
33 times in 301 plate appearances; at 11 percent, the lowest figure
in the American League. But there is an element of surprise to his
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually when it's a guy I'm familiar with, I have an idea of
what they've got,'' Martinez said. ``A lot of times I'll still take
the first pitch, but in this situation I just thought it was
appropriate to be aggressive. They were throwing me first-pitch
strikes the whole series.''
</P>
<P>
   Halama used first-pitch strikes effectively, and they helped him
to the shutout. Moyer said he looked at the scoreboard at one point
and noticed Halama had thrown 16 balls and 54 strikes. ``That's
pitching,'' Moyer said.
</P>
<P>
   And Halama kept pitching until the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed me something,'' said first baseman David Segui. ``He
was tired, he walked a guy and hit a guy, but he wasn't going to
let (Piniella) take him out. He earned a lot of respect today _ not
that he didn't have it before, but that's a tough team to shut
down, and he did.''

   Gilman Kraft, the owner of Playbill magazine in the 1960s and
more recently the owner and president of Performing Arts magazine
in California, died on June 27 at a hospital in Los Angeles. He was
73 and lived in Beverly Hills, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, according to a statement released by
Performing Arts magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft was born in Union City, N.J., on April 22, 1926, and
worked during World War II as a linguist with the U.S. Army.

EDITORIAL: ISLE W/ HISTORY, HARBOR VUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, July 5:
</P>
<P>
   During a helicopter ride with Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
D-N.Y., on Oct. 22, 1995, President Clinton offered to sell
Governors Island to New York City for $1. More than three years
after the president's generous offer, the city still lacks the kind
of credible, comprehensive proposal for the 172-acre island's
redevelopment that Congress and the White House will need before
they can approve any deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani administration wasted 1998 in futile pursuit of
casino gambling as a source of tax revenue to cover the island's
annual upkeep. City Hall shelved that idea after the state wisely
showed no interest in authorizing legalized gambling there. Now
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has an informal task force reviewing
proposals from developers, universities and museums, among others.
Its meetings have been consumed by a search for businesses whose
revenues would help maintain the island.
</P>
<P>
   What the task force apparently has not done is draft a set of
principles for redevelopment, guidelines that would ensure public
access to the island's vast open spaces and its landmarks. The
island's historic structures, including Castle Williams, are grand
repositories of the nation's Colonial and wartime past, stretching
from the Revolutionary War to the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of guidelines has yielded some misbegotten ideas.
The Danish amusement park operator Tivoli Gardens, for example,
would like to use the island's historic north end as the backdrop
for one of its entertainment projects. Americans should not have to
buy an amusement park ticket to experience their patrimony. Nor
should this area be fenced off. A rule book might have steered this
company elsewhere on the island.
</P>
<P>
   City Hall's commercial ambitions may have another side effect.
Some in Washington, including Moynihan's office, say this strategy
dooms the chances of resurrecting the $1 deal or executing any deal
that conveys the island for a nominal sum. In general, surplus
property can be sold for a song if the buyer is a public entity
with a clear public purpose. Others believe that with a few strokes
of creativity it will still be possible to satisfy the legal
requirements of a $1 deal, provided Giuliani and Gov. George Pataki
are willing to work cooperatively.
</P>
<P>
   Without delay, City Hall and Albany should pool their
intellectual capital and create a public corporation ready to own
and operate the island in the national interest. Within this
mandate there should be sufficient room for a limited number of
commercial uses that help pay the island's bills and are compatible
with its character. By no later than Labor Day, Giuliani and Pataki
should give Washington a plan that places the preservation and
appropriate treatment of landmarks and open space ahead of
commercial uses.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, acquiring the island for $1 or a nominal amount will
not be easy. Moynihan will need to secure passage of legislation
canceling the 1997 balanced-budget clause requiring a sale at
fair-market value in fiscal 2002. Washington values the island at
$500 million _ a fanciful figure given the costs of restoring
seawalls and historic structures.
</P>
<P>
   Endowed with magnificent views of the Statue of Liberty and
Ellis Island, Governors Island ought to become the third jewel in
New York Harbor. Both the city and the state should be willing to
commit public funds to attract federal aid. The early-17th-century
Dutch acquired Nooten Eylandt from the Manahatas Indians for a
pittance. So long as the city, Albany and Washington cooperate, the
new deal should be just as advantageous for all Americans. Without
flexing much governmental muscle at all, the mayor and the governor
can ensure that the fourth anniversary of the $1 deal this fall is
not the start of another year of procrastination.

AUTO GADGETS DRIVE COMMUTERS TO DISTRACTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY STEVE CARNEY 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With your car phone ringing, the fax machine
buzzing and a voice from the onboard computer telling you what
street to take, it can be tough to concentrate at 75 mph.
</P>
<P>
   And that's exactly the problem, according to new research from
Virginia Tech University that examines how drivers are distracted
by in-car technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tasks are becoming more, and they're becoming more
complex,'' said Tom Dingus, director of the Center for
Transportation Studies at Virginia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now drivers are doing planning, communication, computation,
and that can take drastically a greater amount of time and
attention,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A National Highway Traffic Safety Administration study last year
found driver distractions contributed to half of all crashes. And a
1997 report in the New England Journal of Medicine said cellular
phone use quadruples the chances of a crash _ about the same risk
as driving drunk.
</P>
<P>
   Dingus, whose institute studies in-car devices for
manufacturers, said the proliferation of navigation systems and
even computers and mobile fax machines is increasing the potential
for trouble on the road.
</P>
<P>
   An extreme example may be actor Will Smith's Chevrolet Suburban,
with $120,000 worth of custom goodies including two cell phones
and, for passengers, three liquid-crystal video monitors, a DVD
player, stereo VHS, a TV tuner, Nintendo 64 and Sony Playstation
video games.
</P>
<P>
   What Dingus found is the more complex the devices, the more
danger for drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Some accessories forced drivers to look away from the road 20 to
25 times and required 60 seconds or more of attention, Dingus said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not particularly good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The threshold for trouble is when the driver has to glance at
something six or more times, or if he or she has to focus on a
device for 20 or more seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when the risk really starts to increase. You really
lose your situational awareness. You don't know what the traffic is
around you, and you can be surprised,'' Dingus said.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers may not notice they're drifting out of their lane or
slowing down or won't see a traffic hazard in time.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Spring, spokesman for the Automobile Club of Southern
California, said the distracted-driver research at Virginia Tech
reinforces the safety message his agency gives drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prime reason for being in the car is to drive and drive
safely,'' Spring said. Cellular phones or onboard navigation
systems ``can be helpful to get you somewhere, but it's no use to
get you somewhere if you crash in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   He said drivers should stop driving if they find themselves
having to pay too much attention to any device.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pull over to the side of the road, get your information and
move on,'' Spring said. ``Multitasking may work well in the office
environment, but not on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   The thirst for more car devices seems insatiable, according to
automakers, accessory manufacturers and computer and communications
companies. They continue producing gizmos for drivers, from mobile
faxes to fasteners to attach a laptop computer to the steering
wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Dingus said the devices can be useful, if used safely. He said
an onboard navigation computer is easier to use than a paper map,
for instance.
</P>
<P>
   About 80,000 vehicles in the United States carry electronic
navigation systems, said Roger King, spokesman for the Washington
D.C.-based Intelligent Transportation Society of America. He said
they're far more popular in Europe and Japan, which each has more
than four times that many.
</P>
<P>
   But Hertz has begun supplying 50,000 of its midsize and larger
rental cars in the United States, Canada and Europe with navigation
systems. The company first tested 600 of the units in 1995, and
their popularity has made the company increase the number ever
since, Hertz spokeswoman Paula Stifter said.
</P>
<P>
   Using Global Positioning Satellites, Hertz's NeverLost system
can give the car's location on a small screen, and display a basic
map showing the way to any location the driver types in. But as
soon as the customer turns it on, the system warns not to use it
while driving.
</P>
<P>
   One driver's aid that is nearly hands-free is Cadillac's On Star
system. With that a driver can press a button and be connected with
a remote operator who can give directions, make restaurant
reservations and track the car via satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a driver is only talking and not looking at something,
he or she can still be distracted if quick decisions are needed,
Dingus said. ``One of the real critical things was what the driver
is doing with the information,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The most prevalent potential troublemaker remains the cellular
phone.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says the
United States will have about 80 million cell phone users by next
year.
</P>
<P>
   And, in a recent survey by Prevention magazine, 85 percent of
the respondents said they sometimes use their cell phones while
driving. That, despite the fact 70 percent said it took at least as
much concentration as tuning the radio, and 18 percent said phone
use distracted them from the road.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, July 5:
</P>
<P>
   President Mohammad Khatami hopes to strengthen the rule of law
in Iran and repair ties with the West. But his efforts are
threatened by the dubious espionage charges that clerical
prosecutors brought against 13 Iranian Jews. Khatami, who has been
trying to limit his conflicts with conservative clerics before an
important parliamentary election, has been cautious in speaking out
on this case. But this is a case he cannot condone if he wishes to
improve ties with the West.
</P>
<P>
   The arrested Jews are accused of giving military information to
Israel and the United States. Until the past few days, they had
been held incommunicado. They are still being denied family visits,
kosher food and legal representation. Although no trial has yet
been held and no incriminating evidence made public, influential
Iranian clerics have all but declared the 13 Jews guilty and called
for their hanging.
</P>
<P>
   Under Iran's Islamic constitution, the Jewish community is an
officially recognized religious minority. Currently, about 25,000
Jews live in Iran, a nation of nearly 70 million people. More than
50,000 Jews have emigrated since the 1979 revolution. Those who
remained have had to contend with two decades of government
hostility to Israel and several previous espionage prosecutions
against Jewish Iranians, although none on this scale.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is worry that militant clerics frightened by Khatami's
more tolerant views could strike back against vulnerable Iranian
Jews. Khatami has tried to reassure the Jewish community and has
spoken out publicly in defense of the legal rights of its members.
But he has not challenged the abusive handling of this case.
Outside Iran there have been many expressions of concern. Israel
has worked hard to mobilize international attention. The United
States has called on Iran to free those arrested, as have Germany,
France and the European Union. The Iranians should understand that
the persecution of Jews will throw Iran's relations with the West
into a new freeze, crippling Iran's attempt to revive its stagnant
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami seems loath to risk accusations of endangering national
security by interfering with the prosecution of alleged spies. But
so far, this case seems to be less about foreign espionage than
about a campaign by Khatami's domestic enemies to sabotage his
program of reform and dialogue with the West. The Iranian people
have already paid a high price for the international isolation they
have endured for two decades. It would be a pity if Khatami's
reforms were now undermined by a contrived spy case.

LOS ANGELES: from the road.

<P>
   Linda Tellez of Burbank said she used to make calls from her
1999 Cadillac Seville in her job as a client relations manager for
a marketing firm. She quit when she found herself struggling to
read the numbers and weaving in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said forget it, this is too distracting,'' Tellez, 51, said.
``It's too much.''
</P>
<P>
   But her husband, Lou, a general contractor, still makes mobile
calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's on the phone, and it's, hey, you passed the house,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Koris, 71, a lawyer from Los Angeles who drives a Lexus
SC300, said he's had several close calls with distracted drivers.
But he takes precautions when making calls himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try ideally to turn over to the curb or only punch the
number in when I'm at a stoplight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But King said we shouldn't demonize cell phones or in-vehicle
navigation systems because they could cause distractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good heavens, what do we do when we drive our cars? We do
crossword puzzles. We put makeup on. We do a lot of things that
distract ourselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dingus acknowledged that other things inside the car can muddle
a driver _ changing a CD, or listening to an engrossing book tape.
But those acts don't require as much concentration as processing
information or carrying on a conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not trying to make a decision, and it's not a
forced-pace decision,'' Dingus said. ``It's not, I've got to decide
whether to take this exit or not, or whether to sell my stock or
not.''

CHINA GOES LONG WAY TO GET REMATCH 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The fireworks followed as Bruce Springsteen
belted out ``Born in the USA'' and fans waved Chinese flags.
Quickly, the post-semifinal scene at Foxboro Stadium became an
impromptu show of Chinese pride. A costume dragon paraded through
the parking lot. In front of China's team bus, a crowd clamored for
autographs.
</P>
<P>
   Before 28,986 fans Sunday, the Norwegians watched in shock as
the Chinese celebrated their 5-0 victory and berth in the Women's
World Cup final. China took a victory lap, while defending champion
Norway regrouped in a huddle at the edge of the center circle.
</P>
<P>
   The result equaled the worst defeat in Norwegian soccer history
and certainly sent shock waves to the West Coast, where coach Tony
DiCicco and the US team await. The Chinese now have a perfect
opportunity to avenge past tournament losses to the Americans and
win top honors at a world championship. Last year, the US beat
China for the gold medal at the Goodwill Games with a performance
reminiscent of the Americans' gold medal win over the Chinese at
the Atlanta Olympics. But the US-China rivalry can be traced to the
inaugural World Cup in 1991 when the US took home the trophy with
host China on the sidelines after a quarterfinal loss so
devastating that the women's national team program was shut down
for two years.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese have waited a long time for this championship
rematch. And they have traveled a long way to reach the Rose Bowl
final, criss-crossing the country three times to make the
Foxborough semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the best team we've had in a few years,''
said China coach Ma Yuanan, whose record against the US this year
is 2-1. ``Next Saturday, the team we play will be stronger than
tonight. I want the team (that beat the US on April 25) to show
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheered by a large red-shirted crowd in the southwest corner of
the stadium and several bilingual banners, the Chinese scored early
and peppered Norwegian goalkeeper Bente Nordby often in the first
half. China outshot Norway, 11-0, in the opening half and finished
with a 20-12 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The first China goal came in the third minute off a shot by
captain Sun Wen. Positioned at the top of the penalty area, China's
leading scorer controlled a rebound, bent the ball around a
defender, and passed Nordby with a left-footed shot. The goal gave
Sun six for the tournament, placing her one behind Brazilian
midfielder Sissi. She equaled Sissi in the 72d minute with a
penalty kick placed top shelf for China's fifth and final goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (the US) will bombard me next week and I must be
prepared,'' said Sun, who along with her coach spoke through a
translator. ``As captain, I feel I am obliged to lead the team. I
never thought about (being the top scorer in the World Cup). My
whole concentration is playing with the team.''
</P>
<P>
   China went ahead, 2-0, when Liu Ailing benefitted from a head
ball by Monica Knudsen as she tried to protect her goal from a
Chinese corner kick. The header landed at the feet of Liu and the
midfielder from Beijing wasted no time tucking a powerful shot just
under the crossbar. She scored again off another corner kick in the
51st minute and Fan Yunjie redirected a free kick for a 4-0 China
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese were frighteningly faster than their opponents.
Whether attacking or defending the Norwegians were a step slow,
often needing two players to wrest the ball from the diminutive
Chinese athletes. With long balls sent forward from the back and
midfield, the team from the Far East made the best use of its
speed, often catching the Norwegian zone defense off guard or
poorly positioned. The teams appeared to play at different tempos.
And China prevented Norway from getting a comfortable rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese were dangerous every time they sent a ball within 25
yards of the goal. They increased their chances with an attack that
came in waves. When one forward missed an opportunity to redirect a
cross, another was quick to advance for a second try.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the best China team I've ever played against,'' said
Norway's Hege Riise. ``If China plays the way they played today
with all their speed and with their play in the box, China will
beat the USA.''
</P>
<P>
   With one more cross-country journey bringing total tournament
mileage to 16,500, the Chinese may have the Americans just where
they want them.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER:   AUSTRALIA'S GREAT BARRIER REEF, UNDER
ASSAULT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PHILIP M. BOFFEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRNS, Australia _ The Great Barrier Reef stretches more than
1,200 miles along the northeast coast of Australia, the largest
system of coral reefs in the world. It is not a single continuous
structure but a mosaic of some 2,800 fringing reefs around islands,
freestanding platform reefs in the open sea and ribbon reefs that
parallel the northernmost shoreline. Segments seen last week on a
cruise through its middle sections, from Townsville to Cairns, have
the look of thriving underwater communities, where reef-building
hard corals and gently swaying soft corals support a rich array of
colorful fish, sea turtles, clams and other marine life. But here
and there patches of bleached or dying corals provide a hint of the
myriad threats that have some scientists convinced that the
long-term health of the reef is in danger.
</P>
<P>
   It took thousands of years to build the reef to its current
dimensions. As sea waters rose and moved inland at the end of the
last Ice Age, they created a new coastline and offshore islands. In
the shallow surrounding waters, with just the right mix of warm,
clear water and sunlight, coral polyps, tiny cylindrical animals
with a mouth and protruding tentacles at one end, performed their
geological mission, taking calcium from the water and ultimately
depositing it as limestone skeletons that cement together to form
the reef.
</P>
<P>
   To a snorkeler or scuba diver, the reef looks like a petrified
undersea garden in muted browns, tans and off-white, with splashes
of blue and purple for accent. This living coral forms a thin
veneer on the surface of pock-marked skeletal limestone laid down
over the ages. It is a strange, graceful, fragile world, capable of
scraping and stinging those who bump against it, but vulnerable to
a human kick or carelessly thrown anchor that hits the living
surface.
</P>
<P>
   Reefs are more resilient than many think, and over the years,
the Great Barrier Reef has survived repeated onslaughts. Cyclones
regularly devastate the living reef, only to have the damaged
segments rebound in a couple of decades. The crown-of-thorns
starfish, which devours coral polyps, attacked in force twice in
recent decades and is on the march again, sparking debate over
whether such outbreaks are wholly natural or are worsened by human
activities. Abnormally high water temperatures have caused coral
bleaching and death on large portions of the inner reef, part of
the worst global outbreak of bleaching ever recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Yet today, at a time when some other reefs are rapidly
declining, the Great Barrier Reef is in relatively good shape,
protected by its immense size, by low population densities in its
remote northern reaches and by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park
Authority, which tries to balance such conflicting uses as tourism,
fishing and conservation of a great natural resource that has
qualified as a ``World Heritage Area'' under the United Nations. A
global reef-monitoring network has found that most of the Great
Barrier Reef is in good condition.
</P>
<P>
   But there are worrisome signs of danger as areas of the mainland
fill in with people and development. Cattle grazing and sugar-cane
growing have unleashed silt that smothers polyps on the inner reefs
and a flood of nutrients that cause algal blooms, which block
essential sunlight. The reef is also under assault from urban
pollution, increasing tourism and trawling that scoops up vast
quantities of bycatch along with the target prawns. Oil shale
mining has been proposed adjacent to the marine park, and more than
100 coastal development projects are under consideration. Worse
yet, say many conservationists, the current national and state
governments are too bent on development to serve as conscientious
guardians of the reef. The marine park authority itself has only
limited influence over mainland activities.
</P>
<P>
   Conservation groups have made defense of the reef a priority,
and four respected scientists wrote to the U.N.'s World Heritage
Bureau to call for an independent review of the threats. They warn
that the reef ``will steadily degrade'' and faces ``slow death''
from a ``thousand cuts'' as it is currently managed.
</P>
<P>
   But officials of the marine park authority find no clear
evidence in their monitoring data of any significant, large-scale
declines in the health of the reef, just localized problems and
anecdotal reports of long-term damage. They express cautious
optimism that continued vigilance will keep the emerging threats
under control. Still, an outside review could provide reassurance
or a goad to more vigorous protection. At a time when reefs in many
areas of the globe are succumbing, it would be tragic if the
greatest of all were to join their ranks.

US WIN A KEEPER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ You didn't think Uncle Sam's nieces (and
mamas) were going to lose to Brazil on the Fourth of July on home
soil did you? Just because it happened to his nephews here five
years ago to the day didn't mean history would repeat itself.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't mean the US women's soccer team didn't have to
sweat mightily Sunday afternoon to reach the World Cup final that
everybody but themselves seemed to take for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care who we play in the final,'' said defender Brandi
Chastain, after the Americans had shut out the samba sisters, 2-0,
before 73,123 at Stanford Stadium to earn a Saturday date with
China in the Rose Bowl. ``I'm just excited to be going.''
</P>
<P>
   The US, which has lost only one home match in three years and
was 8-1-1 against Brazil, didn't figure to lose this one. But it
wasn't until Michelle Akers slammed home a penalty kick in the 80th
minute that the Yanks felt sure they were going to win it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sweet and you want to savor it,'' said Akers, who played
the full 90 minutes despite taking a savage beating. ``This World
Cup has been a battle.''
</P>
<P>
   For 75 minutes, after they got a gift goal when Brazilian keeper
Maravilha bobbled a cross directly onto Cindy Parlow's forehead,
the Americans nursed a lead that threatened to vanish at any
moment. And if it hadn't been for keeper Briana Scurry, who saved
them literally one-handed, the US could have gone to overtime _ or
gone home for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got to be the best game I ever played,'' said the former
University of Massachusetts star, who made half a dozen stops,
including an outstretched palm job on a blast from Nene in the 56th
minute that would have tied the match. ``I feel awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Awesome and relieved. After coming from behind twice to defeat
Germany in the quarterfinals, the Americans were hoping for an
easier go with the Brazilians, who'd had to go to overtime to beat
the same Nigerians whom the US had blitzed, 7-1.
</P>
<P>
   And after five minutes, it looked that the hosts might be in for
a holiday spree after Maravilha coughed up Julie Foudy's cross and
Parlow, sitting on the doorstep, headed it in for a gimme. ``We
knew she was weak in the air,'' said Parlow. ``So we crashed the
goal after every shot.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were no more gimmes, and well before halftime the
Yanks knew they were in for a match. Scurry had to come steaming
out to grab Pretinha's shot in the 30th minute, then Akers had to
pounce on a loose ball in the area in the 33d and clear it over the
crossbar.
</P>
<P>
   Akers, the team's 33-year-old alpha female with the flowing
mane, played with a fierce urgency all day. In the first half
alone, she survived a headknocking with Katia that put both players
on the ground and a cleat to the face from Sissi that briefly put
Akers off the field. But each time, she got up and kept prowling.
</P>
<P>
   After a dozen knee surgeries and countless concussions, Akers
takes mere run-of-play mayhem for granted. ``It gets to the point
where you're so beat up,'' she shrugged, ``that another little ding
isn't going to stop you.''
</P>
<P>
   So Akers was still on the field at crunch time and when Mia Hamm
was pushed down in the penalty area by Brazilian captain Elane, it
was Akers who got the call for the PK.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm had seen precious little of the ball until supersub Shannon
MacMillan came on for Parlow in the 62d minute to shake things up.
Finally, she came dashing toward the goal with the ball. ``And the
next thing I knew, I was on the ground,'' Hamm said. ``I don't know
what it looked like, but . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilians were howling no foul, but Finnish referee
Katriina Elovirta pointed to the spot. Up came Akers, whose penalty
kick tied the Norwegians and set up MacMillan's `golden goal' that
put the US in the Olympic final three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God we were ahead by a goal this time,'' Akers mused.
But she calmly blasted the ball cleanly to Maravilha's left and her
teammates were in the Cup final again. So they took their thank-you
lap, then flopped down delighted but depleted in the locker room.
Pasadena may be just down the road, but the topography is brutal.

GAME SPARKS GREAT DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
 ANALYSIS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ The debate began as soon as the Women's
World Cup semifinal match was over. It's always like that in
sports. Two people watch the same event and then shock you by
coming up with completely different explanations for their team's
win or loss.
</P>
<P>
   I easily could have ended a debate like that Sunday at Stanford
Stadium. I could have reminded both parties that since Team USA
defeated Brazil to advance to Saturday's Rose Bowl final against
China, there should be no argument. ``People,'' I could have said
in my British soccer voice, ``It was 2-nil. The Yanks are supreme.
Now clear this pitch immediately!''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously that didn't happen. On one side of my mind, a
flag-waving patriot talked about the dominance of the US team. On
the other, a finger-wagging skeptic warned that the Americans will
have silver medals flashing in their eyes if they play like this on
Saturday. They went back and forth for hours. I thought of throwing
a punch myself, just to end the chatter. Instead I listened.
</P>
<P>
   Patriot: Did you see that? Another US shutout. I'm telling you,
that Briana Scurry is the best keeper in the world. More than
73,000 people saw that today.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptic: Please. What you should say is that more than 73,000
people saw the refs give the game to the Americans. Did you hear
what Wilson de Oliveira, Brazil's coach, said after the game?
</P>
<P>
   P: If he didn't say, ``Their team is better and they beat us,''
his words are irrelevant. Blame the refs. Yeah. That's original.
</P>
<P>
   S: He spoke the truth. He said: ``There was no necessity for the
refereeing to be so bad. Because the United States is such a great
team, they don't need that kind of help.''
</P>
<P>
   P: I take it he was referring to Elane's foul on Mia Hamm?
</P>
<P>
   S: You mean Mia's flop?
</P>
<P>
   P: Hamm was on her way to a goal in the 80th minute and Elane
clearly tripped her. You saw it just like I did.
</P>
<P>
   S: You're such a homer. That play changed the game. Why call
that then? It's like calling a foul in the final seconds. Yo, let
'em play. Michelle Akers gets a penalty kick and that's the game,
2-nothing.
</P>
<P>
   P: Match. It's called a match.
</P>
<P>
   S: You're a pretentious homer, too. Did that not change the
GAME?
</P>
<P>
   P: I will agree that it sealed it. But with you and your boy
from Brazil ref-bashing, you forgot to mention the first goal. What
about that?
</P>
<P>
   S: Uh . . . I think the biased American refs greased the ball.
</P>
<P>
   P: Right. It was only the fifth minute when Maravilha _ which
ironically means ``Marvelous'' in Portuguese _ made the real play
of the game. Basically, she was in goal when the ball slipped out
of her hands. All Cindy Parlow did was put in a header and that was
the match, friend.
</P>
<P>
   S: You should wipe that smile off your face. China won its game,
5-0. If the US plays Saturday against China like it did against
Brazil, that's the silver medal for the home team.
</P>
<P>
   P: I asked Tony DiCicco, the US coach, about that. He said his
team didn't play its best and that ``Soccer is a game of
mistakes.'' He also said, ``We will have to be a better team
Saturday than we were today.''
</P>
<P>
   S: So why are you still smiling?
</P>
<P>
   P: The Americans played in Washington, D.C., on Thursday. They
had an emotional match against the Germans there and then had to
fly six hours here, across three time zones. They had no legs. And
it was hot. Combine all that and they still win, not playing their
best.
</P>
<P>
   S: That's true. But look at some of the saves Scurry had to
make. It looks good when a keeper flies through a crowd and
smothers a ball. Hey, I wish Maravilha had done that. But
spectacular saves like that usually mean there has been a
breakdown. The US defense has been pathetic at times.
</P>
<P>
   P: Excuse me? Brazil did not score. Do you understand that?
Sissi had come into the match as the highest scoring forward in the
Cup. She did nothing. One time, I even remember her pouting when a
teammate didn't deliver a cross pass to her.
</P>
<P>
   S: Listen to me. I think China is the best team in the world.
You can make silly mistakes against the inexperienced teams and get
away with it. You know what the US record is against Brazil? 9-1-1.
They own this team. They won't do this against the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   P: Give those women from Brazil their props. They hadn't been
shut out in eight years of Cup play. They have terrific individual
players and, once they begin to anticipate things as a team,
they'll be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   S: Now you're starting to make sense. The Brazilians need a
player like Akers.
</P>
<P>
   P: Yep. She's a warrior. She was kicked in the face. She got a
lump on her head. After the match, she had a bandage on her right
hand and a bleeding sore on her right knee. She has 12 goals _ and
12 knee operations _ in her Cup career.
</P>
<P>
   S: Yeah. But Hamm looks a little shaky.
</P>
<P>
   P: That's it. I can't argue with you. You're thick-headed. Do
you understand that she was the reason for the 80th minute
sequence?
</P>
<P>
   S: Yep. Tell her to stop by Hollywood before she goes to the
Rose Bowl. If she had really been taken down hard, she wouldn't
have been smiling like she was after the GAME. I didn't see a
bruise on her.
</P>
<P>
   P: Goodbye. Elane did a terrible thing. I'm glad the crowd booed
her every time she touched the ball after that. I'm out . . .
</P>
<P>
   S: Hey, I'm sorry. I'll be civil. Just one more innocent
question. Please?
</P>
<P>
   P: All right, go ahead.
</P>
<P>
   S: Can you believe John McNamara had the nerve to take Roger
Clemens out of Game 6 in '86?

   CHICAGO _ Halfway through the Red Sox' first season without No.
42, who would have believed that if anyone needed a sympathy card,
it would be Mo Vaughn?
</P>
<P>
   But here sit the Sons of Jimy Williams, their midseason record
only two games off what it was a year ago (47-34 instead of 49-32)
after Bret Saberhagen, working quickly in breath-sapping heat,
coolly dispatched the White Sox, 5-2, Sunday in the rubber game of
this three-game set.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago at this time, they were 10 games behind the Yankees.
That deficit stands at three after Saberhagen, pitching into the
eighth inning for the first time since he first showed off his
stitched-spackled-and-stapled shoulder in a Red Sox uniform two
summers ago, allowed just five hits, walked no one, and threw just
70 pitches before giving way to the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Lowe produced three ground balls in the eighth, Tim
Wakefield worked the ninth for his eighth save, and the Sox, again
playing without Nomar Garciaparra but borne aloft on the shoulders
of Troy O'Leary _ and when did you ever think you'd entertain that
idea? _ headed for Florida and four games with the troublesome
Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really shows we have some guys who want to win and know
how to win,'' said center fielder Darren Lewis after the Red Sox
seized the lead on O'Leary's two-run home run in the third and
expanded on it in unglamorous but effective fashion to dispose of
Chicago. ``We didn't use Mo's absence as an excuse. We accepted it
as a challenge as a group, that we can play this game. We've got
guys who do a lot of little things that don't show up in a box
score, and we've had guys who have stepped in and played very
well.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has stepped up more than O'Leary, who accepted Jaime
Navarro's invitation to swing at a 3-and-0 meatball with Mike
Stanley aboard on a two-out double in the third and hit it deep
into the right-field seats for his 17th home run, giving the Sox a
2-1 lead that they never gave back.
</P>
<P>
   Navarro, showing better judgment than he did on the mound,
didn't bother to stick around and explain why he gave O'Leary
anything to hit with first base open and Lou Merloni on deck. One
can only guess, but maybe it's because Navarro has as much trouble
believing this about O'Leary as many of those about to read the
following words:
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary, who now is tied with Garciaparra for the club lead in
RBIs with 57, has driven in more runs than Vaughn did by the midway
point last season.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn after the team's first 81 games: .327, 21 HRs, 16 2Bs, 56
RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary at the same point this season: .309, 17 HRs, 20 2Bs, 57
RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   With stats like that, O'Leary is liable of being accused
Garciaparra's protection in the Sox lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow,'' Lewis said at the notion that the man known as Yummy
has outproduced the Hit Dog. ``I mean, that's tremendous, the fact
that he's been able to improve himself from last season. It seems
like every year he's getting to be a better player offensively and
defensively, which is definitely a big boost for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's picking us up offensively, especially with Nomar and Val
(John Valentin) out, and showing that he's growing as a player.
That's a credit to his perseverance in trying to become a better
player.''
</P>
<P>
   The little things to which Lewis alluded generated the other
three Sox runs. The rookie third baseman, Wilton Veras, scored some
big points with both his teammates and manager when he followed
Jason Varitek's double by rolling out to the right side. Varitek
took third on the play and scored on Lewis's infield out to make it
3-1 in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid is hitting .180 (actually, .214) and he gets the
runner over,'' Jimy Williams said. ``He helped us win. There's no
stat for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Merloni's infield hit knocked in the fourth run in the fifth,
and an inning later, Lewis drew a two-out walk, stole second, and
scored when Ray Durham kicked Jose Offerman's ground ball, one of
two errors made by the White Sox second baseman.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen, who hung a curveball to Paul Konerko in the second
inning that Konerko relocated to the left-field bleachers, was hurt
again in the fifth by Konerko, who hit a leadoff double and came
around to score Chicago's other run.
</P>
<P>
   But otherwise, he set down the White Sox in order in four
innings and had retired nine in a row before giving up a double to
the first Chicago hitter in the eighth, Brook Fordyce. Since coming
off his second stint on the disabled list, Saberhagen has won three
straight starts, which for the Red Sox means he's gone from
stepping on glass to practically walking on water, a role
exclusively held by Pedro Martinez until now.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talk about Pedro for a reason,'' Saberhagen said. ``He's
the best pitcher I've seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you can't win with just one guy. George Brett wasn't able
to carry us to championships (in Kansas City) by himself. We had
other good guys to pick him up.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis puts it another way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at this point we've surprised a lot of people,'' he
said. ``And the reason why we're the way we are is we take the game
seriously and do whatever we can to win a ballgame, period.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's us,'' Williams said. ``There's only one reason to play,
and that's to win.''

SAMPRAS A HIGH FLYER AT WIMBLEDON? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Pete Sampras is no longer the best male tennis player
in the world. He is merely the best male tennis player in world
history.
</P>
<P>
   A day after being displaced by Andre Agassi as No. 1 for the
moment, Sampras became co-No. 1 of all time. His 6-3, 6-4, 7-5
defusing of his American compatriot and longtime nemesis in the
Wimbledon final on Centre Court Sunday enabled Sampras to tie
Australian Roy Emerson for the most Grand Slam titles, 12.
</P>
<P>
   On a lesser level, but only slightly, Sampras's sixth crown in
seven years guarantees that he will enter the millennium as the
most prolific Wimbledon male of the 20th century. He broke a tie
with Bjorn Borg and Laurie Doherty, and on the all-time list he
trails only Willie Renshaw, who won seven Wimbledons in the 1880s.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras also made it a banner star-spangled day on the Fourth of
July, joining his former Palos Verdes, Calif., neighbor Lindsay
Davenport, the women's winner, in an all-American first dance
Sunday &UR;  &LR; night at the Champions Ball.
</P>
<P>
   All of which was a tad unimaginable for the 27-year-old, who
also tied Ivan Lendl's record of 270 weeks total at No. 1 until the
ATP Tour computer awarded the top spot to Agassi before Sunday's
festivities began.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still spinning a little bit, to be honest with you,'' said
Sampras. ``I haven't thought about (the record) much, and just
getting off the court, it's a little overwhelming to have won what
I've won. I don't know how I do it, I really don't, to be honest
with you. It's going to take time to sink in, a couple of weeks to
have it all sink in, but now it's just getting over with the match
and I'm still spinning.''
</P>
<P>
   He left Agassi reeling. Despite the seedings _ Sampras No. 1,
Agassi No. 4 _ the 29-year-old from Las Vegas seemed the clear
favorite off recent efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, who had fallen as low as No. 142 during his brief tenure
as Mr. Brooke Shields, has been on a phenomenal roll in recent
months, beginning with his startling victory in the French Open,
which made him only the fifth man ever to capture the career Grand
Slam (Australian, French, Wimbledon, US), the one distinction
Sampras can't yet claim. And he had appeared invulnerable on the
way to his first All England Club final since he won here in 1992,
whipping such luminaries as 11th seed Gustavo Kuerten and No. 2
Patrick Rafter.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sampras, who played only one match in six days
because of the plague of rain here, looked rusty in Friday's
quarterfinals, where he got a gift when seventh seed Mark
Philippoussis was forced to retire with a knee injury after taking
the first set; and unimpressive in a four-set semifinal victory
over No. 6 Tim Henman Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But Sampras elevated his game when it mattered, and Agassi was
no phoenix this time. He is the most flamboyant shotmaker in the
game and he played extremely well Sunday. But Sampras is a
metronome, and when he's in his rhythm, as he was in this match,
any challenge is folly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating, to a degree,'' said Agassi, who was trying
to become the first man since Borg to win the French and Wimbledon
in the same year. ``I was certainly trying to figure out what I
could do. I could have served better, but he actually pressured me
into having to serve a little bit bigger because he was hitting
over all his shots. I expected him to be a little more conservative
with his backhand, and he was snapping it and taking chances and he
was hitting and he was making it. I maintained a focus and
intensity, but I just couldn't stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, who broke Agassi at 4-3 in the first set, in the first
game of the second, and at 5-5 in the third, played like a man on a
mission, belying his phlegmatic nature. He wound up with a nasty
cut on his right arm, the product of a couple of belly flops _ one
successful, one not _ and his second serve and forehand returns
were pulverizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, in the middle of the second set, I was on
fire,'' said Sampras, who first faced Agassi in a junior tournament
in Northridge, Calif., at age 10 and has beaten him in three of
their four Grand Slam final encounters, previously winning the 1990
and '95 US Opens and losing the '95 Australian. ``From all aspects
of my game, serving to my groundstrokes, I was playing in the zone.
It's not easy to maintain that on grass, especially playing him,
but it was as well as I could play, plain and simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi could only concede the point, as he had to do so many
times on Centre Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's accomplished more than anybody else has, no question
about it,'' said the runner-up. ``The guy's dominated on grass and
he's finished the year No. 1 six years in a row (yet another
record). His achievements speak for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The achievements read like this: six Wimbledon titles, four US,
two Australian. That makes 12. Which adds up to 1, no matter what a
machine may say.

DAVENPORT DISPATCHES GRAF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ It wasn't necessarily the stature of her conqueror,
6-foot-3-inch Lindsay Davenport, that made Steffi Graf realize she
is no longer the towering presence at Wimbledon. It wasn't
necessarily the authority with which Davenport dispatched her, 6-4,
7-5, in Sunday's women's final on Centre Court that prompted Graf
to announce immediately afterward that her playing days are
finished at the All England Club.
</P>
<P>
   It was just . . . what?
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old grande dame of her tennis generation couldn't,
or wouldn't, be specific after revealing that her 10th final had
been her last Wimbledon match _ a day after she declared she would
contemplate her future only well after this fortnight concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Graf was both vague and testy after following the course of her
fellow German idol, Boris Becker, in making this a farewell
Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't be back here as a player,'' she said after her 14th
Wimbledon, 10th Wimbledon final, and only third Wimbledon final
loss. ``I will not comment on anything other than that. I haven't
had enough time to think about those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet she apparently had reached the decision before she took
Centre Court Sunday, sometime after she made the French Open her
22d Grand Slam title _ and bid adieu to Paris in the wake of that
final. ``I decided before (the match),'' she said, indicating the
loss had no bearing.
</P>
<P>
   She was asked what objectives she might have now that she's
written off France and England, and whether she would compete in
the US Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we talk about today?'' she said. ``I'm not going to go
into anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   She'd given a hint of her withdrawal symptoms Saturday when she
begged out of the mixed doubles with John McEnroe, because of a
thigh problem.
</P>
<P>
   She said it didn't affect her Sunday _ but it certainly affected
the celebrated McEnroe.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very calm but he wasn't so happy,'' she said. ``It was
a very difficult decision for me, and when I talked to him, it
wasn't easy. He said, `Come on, we could win this.' I was trying to
tell him it would be a little difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Graf proved more elusive to the press than she did to Davenport,
who asserted her status as the world's top-ranked player, which she
had reclaimed by reaching the final after previous No. 1 Martina
Hingis got bounced in the first round by qualifier Jelena Dokic.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport, who won the US Open last September but never had
gotten past the quarterfinals here, showed the salutary effects of
a regimen that has reduced her waistline and upgraded her stamina
and mobility.
</P>
<P>
   Her aggressive serves kept Graf off guard, and she won the only
two service breaks _ in the first game of the match, when she
nailed a forehand winner after two deuces; and with the score 5-5
in the second set, when Graf popped a forehand return into the
stands.
</P>
<P>
   A game later, when Graf returned Davenport's serve into the net
on match point, the Californian cupped her hands over her eyes in
elation. As a youngster in Palos Verdes, the daughter of a former
Olympic volleyball player _ whose height and athleticism she
inherited _ used to tune in religiously to NBC's ``Breakfast at
Wimbledon,'' even though it meant dining at dawn. She'd always
wanted to partake of the feast, and Sunday the breakfast of
champions was hers.
</P>
<P>
   But poor Davenport, who became the first American-born woman in
the final since Zina Garrison in 1990, hasn't been able to claim a
headline to call her own here. On Saturday, her semifinal victory
over Alexandra Stevenson was overshadowed by the fact that Julius
Erving had acknowledged the previous evening that Stevenson is his
daughter. In fact, Davenport had been asked more questions about
Stevenson and inflammatory comments made by Alexandra's mother,
former Boston television reporter and part-time freelance
journalist Samantha Stevenson, than she had about herself.
</P>
<P>
   And Sunday her ultimate moment was upstaged by Graf's exit.
Still, the 23-year-old Davenport, who seems like the normal product
of a normal upbringing by normal parents _ which makes her a rarity
on the women's tour _ was too delighted to worry about any
sideshows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels incredible,'' she said. ``After I won, I was in more
shock than anything. I didn't know quite what to do. I would always
say that my best chances were always on hard court. And after
struggling here for a couple of years and not playing so well on
this surface, to win here, to not lose a set, to beat Graf and
(1998 champion Jana) Novotna (in the quarterfinals), who are the
best grass-court players we have _ all of that combined just makes
it the most amazing win.''
</P>
<P>
   So amazing that after her 1-hour 15-minute triumph, interrupted
for 31 minutes by rain, Davenport didn't even mind when she had to
curtsy to make eye contact with the Duke and Duchess of Kent, who
presented her with the gold champion's plate.
</P>
<P>
   Graf, who already has enough of those to serve dinner for seven,
settled for silver. Then she went for the gold watch.

BIG CROWD SEES BIG TURNAROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For a night, saying you were a Los Angeles Dodgers
fan was not a punch line or a reason to get punched.
</P>
<P>
   After six consecutive losses that had taken the life out of
their players, Sunday's monster Fireworks Night crowd of 54,731 was
treated to the Dodgers' best game of the season, a 7-1 victory over
the first-place San Francisco Giants at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It had everything that has been missing this season _ good
pitching, a lot of hustle, a timely home run and a little combative
spirit when Eric Karros nearly got into it with Giants pitcher
Julian Tavarez in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won one game,'' said Karros, who hit a three-run homer in
the second. ``We'll see in a month if it was significant.''
</P>
<P>
   The players, who were chewed out by manager Davey Johnson in a
one-hour meeting before the game, rushed onto the field to meet the
Giants. Tavarez was ejected, Karros was cheered. No punches were
thrown, but for once the Dodgers did not look timid.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Ismael Valdes was on his way to ending a personal
losing streak at five games by limiting the Giants to five hits and
one run in eight innings. Valdes (6-7) had gone that far just once
since April 24.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd not only responded to Valdes, but it roared wildly
over his selection of Latin music when he came to the plate in the
second, fourth and sixth innings. The fans also showed their
appreciation when Valdes legged out an infield hit in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   But most of all, they cheered the long-awaited victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers had dropped six games in seven days to the Giants.
After the game, they flew to Denver to begin a four-game series
against the Colorado Rockies. The Rockies also have been reeling,
losing nine straight before sweeping white-hot San Diego on
Saturday night. They lost to the Padres 11-0 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers didn't want to go into Coors Field with the chance
of waking up the Rockies. They hadn't been swept by the Giants in
Dodger Stadium since 1992, but there was more than history at
stake. They wanted to win to stop the free fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers received a spark from reserve outfielder Trenidad
Hubbard, who had three hits, including a first-inning double off
Giants starter Kirk Reuter (7-4) that tied the game 1-1. After Gary
Sheffield singled Hubbard to third, Karros lifted a pop fly along
the railing in shallow right field. Giants first baseman J.T. Snow
made the catch over his shoulder and Hubbard took off from third.
He slid home well ahead of the throw and suddenly they didn't look
like last year's Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Never more so than in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Karros, back in the cleanup spot he had for years before giving
way to Raul Mondesi, was just 1 for 8 in the series. But he was
batting .364 (16 for 44) in his last 12.
</P>
<P>
   After Hubbard and Sheffield reached on one-out singles, Karros
drove Reuter's 1-0 fastball into the left-field stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great just to get a win with the way we've been
struggling,'' Karros said. ``Hubbard in the No. 2 spot set the
table. I came up three times with men in scoring position. I can't
remember the last time I came up with so many guys on base.''
</P>
<P>
   There were seven innings to play, but Valdes had a lead even a
Dodgers pitcher could not surrender.
</P>
<P>
   In the first two games of this series, starters Carlos Perez and
Chan Ho Park allowed 14 runs in nine innings combined. Even
tonight's starter, club ace Kevin Brown, was shelled for nine runs
in his last start. Darren Dreifort, the team's fifth starter, has a
5.69 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes' last victory was May 27 at Cincinnati. Then he was only
battling blisters on his pitching hand. Things have gotten a lot
worse since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get this team turned around,'' Valdes said.
``Nobody wants to lose six in row, let alone one.''
</P>
<P>
   And echoing the message Johnson delivered in the pregame
meeting, Valdes said, ``We have to do the little things together.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened in the seventh when Karros and Tavarez
started jawing. Karros had taken off on a hit-and-run play. Todd
Hollandsworth, who replaced Mondesi two innings earlier, missed and
Karros was thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Tavarez) was staring me down when I was running off the
field,'' Karros said. ``I assume he was upset I was running with a
6-1 lead. I said something, he gestured. He was staring at me like
I was the one who is (expletive) around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Tavarez, who was ejected by home-plate umpire Joe West after
conferring with his crew, said: ``He was mumbling to me. Only he
knew what he said. We both looked at each other. He knew what he
did.''
</P>
<P>
   He helped win a game and for a night sent the fans home happy.

NAVAJOGOP (Phoenix) _ The Arizona Legislature had just approved
money for a Navajo Nation college, and Elmer Milford wanted to say
thanks. The 20-year veteran of the Navajo Tribal Council marched
into Jeff Groscost's office, whipped out a pen, and changed his
voter registration _ to Republican. It must have drawn a smile from
Groscost, who has been quietly courting Navajo leaders for months.
He pushed two key bills sought by the tribe and has encouraged
Navajos to switch parties, arguing they could get more
legislationpassed with the GOP in power. Democrats say the notion
is laughable, that the idea of a conservative politician winning
over perhaps the most Democratic area of the state is ridiculous.
But for Milford, it made sense. By CHRIS MOESER. Story will move in

FIREWORKS (Peoria, Ariz.) _ A popular fireworks display got off to
an accidental start Sunday in Peoria, sending five pyrotechnic
workers to the hospital, two with possibly life-threatening
injuries, and canceling the show. The explosion happened at 5 p.m.,
about an hour after crews started setting up for the 9 p.m.
extravaganza at the Peoria Sports Complex. The event, staged by the
city for four years, was expected to draw as many as 20,000
spectators. But stacks of fireworks that workers from the Salt Lake
City-based Lantis Fireworks had unloaded in a field suddenly
started detonating, police and fire officials said. White smoke
quickly covered the entire field, said Glendale photographer Chris
Powell, who had been setting up his camera at the La Quinta hotel
across the street. By LISA GONDERINGER. Story will move in the

<P>
   They did it at Wimbledon, performing their own stamp act on the
Fourth of July, Davenport stamping on Steffi Graf, 6-4, 7-5, before
Sampras did the same to Andre Agassi, 6-3, 6-4, 7-5. They were a
couple of cannon crackers, exploding all over Centre Court with
shots that could have re-cracked the Liberty Bell.
</P>
<P>
   When an afternoon shrouded by smoky and lavender clouds
concluded, Sampras had become the Wimbledonian Man of the Century
with his sixth title, a tour de force of such breathtaking
virtuosity that 13,813 jaws dropped with regularity throughout the
arena. Plus Agassi's.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport was standing as tall as Bunker Hill, the loftiest of
this playpen's female champs. At 6 feet 3 inches she looked down on
Sampras Sunday &UR;  &LR; night as they shared the opening dance at the
Wimbledon ball, and maybe she led.
</P>
<P>
   And Graf completed the German retreat begun by Boris Becker _
they were the Sampras and Davenport of 1989 _ by saying
``Nimmerwiedersehen!'' to the Big W. That's a long version of
bye-bye forever, but after 14 glorious years and seven titles, she
could say anything she wants for as long as she wants to her
saddened public.
</P>
<P>
   Southern California, once upon a time the world's tennis
vineyard where numerous Wimbledon champions grew, had a double once
again, the first since Billie Jean King and Stan Smith in 1972.
``We're both Palos Verdes kids,'' whoops Sampras, who now lives in
Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Where have Long Lindsay and Pyrotechnical Pete been hiding
during the fortnight? They've seemed undercover agents while
everybody else got the attention and ink. How could anybody as
imposing as Davenport walk around unnoticed? Good-natured, pleased
to be ignored, and clearly ``feeling better about my chances than
ever before,'' although local bookmakers listed her at 10-1 at the
outset, she was not the story _ until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   She'd had a scare from unknown Barbara Schett in the fourth
round, dodging five set points in a 7-6 (9-7), 6-1 win, but when
you look back on her accomplishments Davenport was merely
phenomenal. Not since the original Martina (Navratilova) in 1990
had a champ won all 14 sets played. To go in with Graf and escape
with your serve unscathed is unheard of.
</P>
<P>
   She was airtight, grabbing the only two break points Graf put on
view, banging her groundies audaciously, powerfully, and precisely,
and startling Graf with nifty volleying. Davenport stooped to
conquer. More nimble than ever, she got down to deal effortlessly,
productively with Graf's scything, turf-skimming backhand, a tough
order for anybody, especially with a two-handed backhand. Her
smart-bomb serving made Graf lose a guessing game.
</P>
<P>
   But if Davenport had to make way for water, the half-hour rain
interruption at a critical moment, ``Pete could walk on water
today,'' according to Agassi.
</P>
<P>
   The shower chased the women as Davenport was about to serve at
4-5, 30-15 in the second set. ``It could have gotten away from me
there,'' she said. ``The delay was good. I got refocused in the
dressing room.''
</P>
<P>
   She lost the first point upon returning (two points from
dropping the set, 30-all), but won a nine-stroke rally, whanged a
service winner, and seized the last two games and the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had one choky moment, a lousy backhand on the first match
point _ but why recall that?'' Davenport said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras wasn't required to walk, run, or swim on water. Grass
was the medium, but there's nothing medium about Sampras when he
sniffs the chlorophyll. He's mammoth with a Wimbledon title at
stake.
</P>
<P>
   For almost two weeks Sampras had been Clark Kent crouched in the
phone booth, patiently waiting to reveal himself as the S-man while
critics talked about his decline and fall. Then he fell on Agassi,
who'd been the man of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need some luck to go all the way,'' Sampras said, ``and I
got it when Mark Philippoussis broke down (hospitalized with a torn
cartilage after winning their first set Friday). I began to get the
feel against Tim (Henman, semifinals).''
</P>
<P>
   Crash! Sampras departed the phone booth without bothering to
open the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on fire,'' he admits.
</P>
<P>
   The grass of Centre was haggard, but it was all his. As far as
Sampras was concerned it could have been the liquid of the Sargasso
Sea or the Everglades. It was still fairly green and Sampras was
beating the yellow balls black and blue. He was serving tons,
giving new definition to volleys from all angles and positions,
punishing backhands and forehands.
</P>
<P>
   He was the consummate master of Centre. But Agassi did not let
him off lightly, despite the straight sets score. He competed so
fiercely and formidably that it was the best and hardest of
Sampras's half-dozen finals, the finest final from both ends since
the John McEnroe-Bjorn Borg epics of 1980-81.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi scored knockdowns _ literally _ but Sampras came up with
bloodied arms from diving volleys on his way to the knockout. Every
time Agassi had a chance to turn things around _ and there were
plenty _ Sampras launched a grenade to get off the spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't come up with better stuff than him. I couldn't
weather his storm. I couldn't stop him,'' Agassi said.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, the shotmaking wizard ``brings out the best in me,''
said Sampras. Sunday he pushed Sampras to reveal his greatness.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Sampras beat a 29-year-old adversary. But this young Greek
god chasing history also caught up with a 62-year-old named Roy
Emerson, now sharing the record of 12 Grand Slam titles. Moreover,
he surpassed his rivals in this fading century: 43-year-old Borg
and long-dead 123-year-old Laurie Doherty, both winners five times.
</P>
<P>
   Can't you hear Laurie's brother, Reggie, chortling at that great
center court in the ozone: ``Sorry, bro, but that SOB Sampras
finally knocked you out of the books.'' Then, looking over at
138-year-old Willie Renshaw, seven-time champ between 1881 and
1889: ``Look out, Willie. Sampras'll get you next.''
</P>
<P>
   And maybe, on an adjoining cloud, Betsy Ross, flapping her flag,
is saying to John Hancock, ``Pete's autograph may just be bigger
than yours.''

SUSPECT IN SHOOTING RAMPAGE KILLS SELF WITH POLICE IN PURSUIT

   SALEM, Ill _ The man suspected in a two-state shooting rampage
that targeted Jews, blacks and Asian-Americans fatally shot himself
on Sunday night after police pursued him in rural southern
Illinois, an FBI spokesman in Salem, Ill., said early Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Benjamin Nathaniel Smith, 21, abandoned his blue
car at a truck stop in Salem and carjacked a van, said Doug
Garrison, an FBI spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was driving south while being chased by police and shot
himself, Garrison said. His car crashed off the road and he was
pronounced dead at a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials said they planned to check fingerprints to make
certain the body is Smith's, but Jim Kennedy, police chief in
Bloomington, Ind., said two guns found with the body were
consistent with two of the shootings _ in Bloomington and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   A light blue Taurus sought by police was also at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said the body had a tattoo on the chest that said
``Sabbath Breaker,'' which Smith was said to have.
</P>
<P>
   Smith had been the subject of the two-state search after
shootings that began Friday in Chicago. Police also said shootings
on Saturday in Springfield and Urbana _ as well as a killing on
Sunday in Bloomington _ appeared to be related.
</P>
<P>
   The latest victim was a Korean-American graduate student who was
killed on Sunday morning as he entered a church in Bloomington,
Ind. That followed an incident late Saturday in Urbana, in which an
Asian-American student at the University of Illinois was shot in
the leg.
</P>
<P>
   In an hourlong series of shootings in the Chicago area on Friday
night, a former basketball coach at Northwestern University, a
black man, was killed as he walked with his children in his
neighborhood, six Orthodox Jews were injured as they walked home
from Sabbath services and two Asian-Americans were shot at as they
sat in their car at an intersection.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man is on a spree,'' said Chicago Police Cmdr. William
Hayes. ``He's shooting people all over.''
</P>
<P>
   In most of the shootings, a white man slowly drove a blue car,
apparently prowling the streets for victims, and said nothing as he
fired, first one handgun, then another while he reloaded the
original, said Patrick T. Camden, a Chicago police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   In Indiana, the police there said, the man waited in his car and
fired as people entered the church. The police have found matching
shell casings at all the sites of the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, whose last known address was in Bloomington, matched the
general description of the killer, and owns a light blue Ford
Taurus with a license plate matching the car that was seen leaving
the Indiana shooting, Kennedy said. A similar car was used in the
earlier shootings, although no witness saw the license number.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the crimes did not yet fit the legal definition
of a hate crime, because they had no expression of hatred or motive
from the shooter.
</P>
<P>
   Groups that monitor racial violence say the Ku Klux Klan, white
supremacist churches and other groups with similar ideologies have
increased their membership dramatically in the Midwest in the
1990s. Smith had been a member of the World Church of the Creator,
an anti-black, anti-Christian, anti-Jewish organization based in
East Peoria, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the group, Matthew F. Hale, described Smith as
nonviolent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben always struck me as a very thoughtful person, very
intelligent,'' Hale, said in a telephone interview. ``I was struck
by his sincerity, his dedication and actually his coolheadedness.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a former Indiana University student, joined the Church of
the Creator in 1998 by paying $35 and pledging his ``undying
loyalty to the white race,'' Hale said. He attended meetings and
ordered large volumes of its literature attacking Jews and blacks,
Hale said, until his one-year membership lapsed in May. The group's
main publication is: ``Facts that the media and government don't
want you to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Hale has been fighting a well-publicized battle to obtain his
law license in Illinois. On Friday, his appeal was denied again by
a state administrative board, because of his racial views. The
shootings began that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have heard speculation from reporters that Ben was angry
about my appeal being denied, but I don't know if that's true,''
said Hale, who plans to appeal to the courts. ``He looked up to me
in a lot of ways because I was committed to the legal fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Hale said his organization neither condoned violence, nor
incited it. He said it did not advocate killing Jews and
non-whites. He proposes instead to ``crowd them off the planet in
self-defense,'' while ``straightening out the thinking of white
people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not in this for hatred,'' Hale said. ``We're here
because we love our own people, and want to protect it. We see the
white people as being raped. We're losing our culture. A lot of
people don't realize how angry the average white person is. We're
told to be ashamed that we're white. We're trying to choose the
legal path, but occasionally some people take a violent course.''
</P>
<P>
   The church, which does not worship any God, is opposed to other
organized religions and has faith only in the white race. Hale said
it supported the views of Hitler in many respects, but differed in
a few. He would not say how many members it has, but said they were
in 22 countries. Its Golden Rule: ``That which is good for the
White Race is the highest virtue. That which is bad for the White
Race is the ultimate sin.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The shootings began about 8:30 p.m. in Rogers Park, a northern
Chicago neighborhood with a large Jewish population and a mix of
races. Six Orthodox Jews walking home from Friday evening services
were shot in four locations. In the first case, the man stood on
the sidewalk and fired at a group of men. The later shootings were
done from a car. None of the wounds appeared to be
life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   The first person was killed less than hour later. Ricky
Byrdsong, 43, the former basketball coach, was shot once in the
back. At least six other shots missed his son and daughter, who
were walking with him near their home in Skokie, just north of
Chicago. Byrdsong, 43, had coached the Northwestern Wildcats for
four seasons, from 1994 to 1997. He also coached at Arizona,
Eastern Illinois, Western Michigan, Iowa State and Detroit Mercy.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, in Northbrook, about three miles northwest,
a man in a blue car fired shots at two Asian-American men in a car.
Neither was hit.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:30 a.m. Saturday in Springfield, Ill., south of Chicago,
two blacks were shot at, but not injured.
</P>
<P>
   In the shooting in Urbana Saturday night, a man in a blue car
fired several shots at a group of six Asian students on a corner
near dormitories and academic buildings, the police said. One was
hit in the leg and was in serious condition, the police said.
Urbana is about two hours east of Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   In Bloomington on Sunday morning, three hours southeast of
Urbana, a man fired four shots into a group of people leaving the
Korean United Methodist Church just before noon. Won-Joon Yoon, a
26-year-old student at the University of Indiana, was hit twice in
the back and killed, the Urbana police said. Witnesses told the
police that the shooter sped east in a blue Ford Taurus, running
several traffic lights.
</P>
<P>
   The Urbana police said they knew Smith, who distributed the
World Church's anti-Semitic literature in Bloomington last year. On
Sunday they issued a warrant for the former student.

REPUBLICANS VIEW NAVAJOS AS A NATURAL CONSTITUENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS MOESER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The Arizona Legislature had just approved money for a
Navajo Nation college, and Elmer Milford wanted to say thanks.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-year veteran of the Navajo Tribal Council marched into
Jeff Groscost's office, whipped out a pen, and changed his voter
registration _ to Republican.
</P>
<P>
   It must have drawn a smile from Groscost, who has been quietly
courting Navajo leaders for months. He pushed two key bills sought
by the tribe and has encouraged Navajos to switch parties, arguing
they could get more legislation passed with the GOP in power.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say the notion is laughable, that the idea of a
conservative politician winning over perhaps the most Democratic
area of the state is ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   But for Milford, it made sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``People up here tease me a little bit,'' said Milford, who
lives in Fort Defiance. ``But in order to get anything done down
there, you can get more things done as a Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Few Navajos have switched parties, but Groscost can point to
other successes. While Democrats napped in 1998 and failed to get
any candidates on the ballot in District 3, Groscost helped elect
Rep. Tom Gordon, R-Peach Springs, only the third Republican to
serve the district since 1971.
</P>
<P>
   The other new member? Rep. Sylvia Laughter, D-Kayenta, whom
Democrats carp is the 41st member of the House GOP caucus. It was
Groscost, not Democrats, who encouraged Laughter to run; he knew
her from their days at Mesa High School.
</P>
<P>
   Groscost says his interest in the region can be traced to his
childhood, when his family sponsored a Navajo child, Rosie Bingham,
who lived with his family and attended school in Mesa. Bingham has
accompanied Groscost on several of his four trips to the Nation
since he became speaker.
</P>
<P>
   But it also says a lot about his political plans, both as Sen.
John McCain's adviser for the Arizona presidential primary and
possible bids in several years for Congress or statewide office.
</P>
<P>
   A NATURAL CONSTITUENCY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Navajo Nation is becoming more important politically. Half
of the Nation's 250,000 residents are ages 18 to 30, and 20 percent
are under 18.
</P>
<P>
   Groscost says Navajos should be a natural constituency for
Republicans. Parts of Navajo culture are very socially
conservative: the tribe has twice voted down gaming, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Navajos want greater sovereignty from the federal government,
Groscost said, including property rights, an issue that also
resonates with conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their ideology and views very closely mirror some very
conservative Christian sects,'' Groscost said. The Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints has a significant presence on the
reservation, giving Groscost, a Mormon, another connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go after people who should be natural constituencies
because their ideology or core beliefs mirror those of our party,''
says Groscost, pointing out that the party is making similar
efforts in the Hispanic community.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason we're putting more emphasis here than (with
Hispanics) is because it is a population that we think we can show
them easily what we can do because it is a contained population and
a universe we can impact.'' &QL; 
GREAT DIVERSITY OF VIEWS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Peter Iverson, an Arizona State University history professor
and an expert on Navajo culture, said it would be wrong to look at
Navajos monolithically. There is great diversity of political and
religious views among tribal members, just like other people in
Arizona. Many Navajos, for example, strongly favor a strong federal
government, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And like other voters, many Navajos have very little loyalty to
political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they can have some success,'' Iverson said of
Groscost's efforts. ``Given the disorganization of the Democratic
party. . . . This is a target that's been ripe for the picking.''
</P>
<P>
   During the last legislative session, Groscost helped Gordon,
Laughter, and Sen. Jack Jackson, D-Window Rock, pass legislation
for Dine College in Tsalie.
</P>
<P>
   The college, which specializes in teaching and preserving Navajo
customs and culture, needed money to shore up crumbling buildings
on the Hogan-shaped campus. The bill allows the college to keep
$17.25 million in state sales taxes generated on the reservation
for education needs.
</P>
<P>
   Groscost also backed a resolution that asks the federal
government to allow former Navajo Nation President Peter Macdonald
to finish his prison term in Arizona, and he supported changes in
the welfare system that Navajos wanted.
</P>
<P>
   In May, he spoke at the college's graduation, where he was
warmly greeted by Navajos who were surprised to see a House speaker
visit there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Groscost was the first speaker to ever come to Navajo land and
sit down with us,'' said Peter Belletto, the superintendent of the
Ganado Unified School District. Groscost visited the Navajo Nation
last year to lobby leaders like Belletto to support the Students
FIRST legislation, the state's new school construction law.
</P>
<P>
   `HE'S KEPT HIS WORD' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Navajo Nation President Kelsay Begay also gives Groscost high
marks for listening to Navajo concerns and then getting things done
at the Capitol. He appreciates that Groscost has treated the tribe
as a nation within a nation. The two men have become friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mentioned Dine College at that very first meeting. He's kept
his word on that because he's been very supportive of the college.
Him showing up at that graduation only verifies that he's very
concerned about the education of Navajo children,'' Begay said.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Dine College bill) has enhanced the state-Navajo
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   But is it enough to convince Navajos to become Republicans?
Begay says it helps, but that more gestures are needed. Groscost
and other Republicans need to spend more time on the reservation,
talking with people, explaining why they should switch parties.
</P>
<P>
   Few people outside tribal leadership, Begay said, would
recognize Groscost's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's looking at an educational process at some point. But the
Navajo Nation being predominantly Democratic _ it's going to be a
job _ a big task. But I can always wish him luck on this,'' said
Begay, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really the first time that Arizona has responded in a
favorable gesture as far as funds. It's going to take a lot more
effort on Arizona's part to convince someone to switch.''
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRATS POINT TO CARR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arizona state Democratic Party Chairman Mark Fleisher agrees,
saying the Republican Party is still ``a pretty White group.''
</P>
<P>
   He points out that the Arizona Democratic Party recently named
Gwen Carr, who is a Native American, as its new executive director.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democratic Party is still the party of diversity,'' he
said. ``The Republicans are trying to get Native Americans and
AfricanHispanics behind them, but the Democratic Party has fought
the battles those communities care about.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferlin Clark, a vice president of Dine College, says the
question of party registration highlights tensions between
traditional and modern Navajo values. He argues that traditional
Navajo values are very much in line with conservative Republican
philosophy. But Navajos have long voted Democratic because the
party more strongly advocates equality and diversity issues.
</P>
<P>
   But he adds that he hasn't seen too many prominent Democrats in
the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've taken it for granted,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   He suggests Navajos would be better served at the Capitol if
they maintain representation in both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Groscost recognizes that Republicans have a battle ahead to
convince Navajos to even consider the Republican Party. He vows to
continue to work with the tribe next year. And he insists his
motivation isn't politics, although he clearly sees an opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be thrilled if they switched. But you're talking about
a culture that thinks not in terms of quarterly reports but in
decades and centuries. These people are still very upset at Kit
Carson for burning the peach trees in Canyon de Chelly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I expect someone to switch to Republican because we did
something good this year? No. What I do expect is that we start
changing some of the culture of distrust between the cultures, and
we start figuring out ways that people down in Phoenix can help the
problems up here instead of making them worse.'' &QL;

WELTON RETURNS TO FRUSTRATE GALAXY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHARD GONZALEZ  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The hottest team in Major League Soccer was
beaten by one of its own Sunday night. Well, Welton used to be one
of its own.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy saw its season-best winning streak snapped at four
games as Miami _ the team with the worst record in the league _
pulled out a stunning 2-1 victory in front of 60,433 fans at the
Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Welton, who was traded from the Galaxy to Miami five weeks ago,
scored the decisive goal in the 64th minute, catching a snoozing
Galaxy defense while just avoiding being offside. Welton sneaked
past three defenders while receiving a feed from substitute Nelson
Vargas, then rifled a rising shot that beat keeper Kevin Hartman
and sunk the Galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe wishing to send a message to his former teammates, Welton
then scooped up the ball and walked off to the side of the net,
prompting an irate Mauricio Cienfuegos to chase him down and snare
the ball away as time wound down.
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy striker Carlo Hermosillo almost knotted the score in the
waning minutes, but his shot from the goal mouth was batted away by
Miami keeper Garth Lagerwey, preserving the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy controlled much of the play in the opening half,
buzzing around on Miami's half of the field almost at will. L.A.
fired 10 shots to only two for the Fusion. But for all its
domination before intermission, the Galaxy almost had nothing to
show for it.
</P>
<P>
   A defensive breakdown in the 13th minute pinned coach Sigi
Schmid's squad to a 1-0 deficit it faced for most of the half.
Diego Serna intercepted defender Robin Fraser's errant clearing
pass at the top of the box, quickly unleashing a low right-footed
shot inside the near post that beat Hartman.
</P>
<P>
   A hail of boos rained down on the Galaxy, a sound not heard in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy drew even in the 38th minute, however, as Roy Myers
capped a nice passing sequence. Myers, left unmarked on the edge of
the penalty box, received a soft pass from Danny Pena and dribbled
in two strides before blasting a shot that landed in the right
corner of the net.
</P>
<P>
   On the painfully long list of blown chances for the Galaxy was a
point-blank shot squandered away by a slumping Cobi Jones in the
20th minute. Jones, last year's U.S. Soccer Player of the Year and
MLS MVP, fired an in-close shot squarely at goalie Garth Lagerwey.
</P>
<P>
   Directing it slightly to either the right or the left would have
put the Galaxy on the board. Jones, who knocked home 19 goals last
season, has scored just twice in 1999. After blowing this chance,
the fan favorite gazed to the heavens in disbelief _ a disturbing,
familiar sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just having no luck and that's part of the game,'' said
Schmid, coming to his forward's defense. ``If I told you I wasn't
concerned about his inability to score, I'd be lying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been fortunate that others like Mauricio (Cienfuegos)
and Carlos (Hermosillo) have taken up the slack. Otherwise, Im
concerned that Cobi would be letting too much of this (frustration)
get to him.''

REVOLUTION ON THE BALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Revolution took an important step toward
establishing an identity Sunday. They set the tone with an
aggressive start, displayed resourcefulness, and held off a
disastrous MetroStars team, 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   They reached the halfway point in the season with 18 points in
16 matches, a pace that would give them their second-best record in
four seasons, and likely be worth a playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   Joe-Max Moore scored twice and former MetroStars striker
Giovanni Savarese scored once for the Revolution. But the
MetroStars kept things close as reserves Nansha Kalonji and Petter
Villegas combined for a spectacular goal in the 84th minute, after
two brilliant saves earlier in the half by Walter Zenga.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played a great first half and had a 2-0 lead,'' Zenga said.
``But we lost concentration for 10 minutes, and it's normal to do
that. We're third in the conference, but it's not easy in the MLS.
We played at 4 o'clock, now we have two games at 1 o'clock. It's
crazy. It's normal to be fatigued, but we feel confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenga conducted his postgame press conference sitting on a stage
in front of Foxboro Stadium, obviously affected by the 90-degree
heat and high humidity.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution pressed forward at the start, and took the
initiative. The midfield played cohesively with John Harkes and
Ivan McKinley in holding positions. But they were vulnerable to
counterattacks, especially when the MetroStars went through Tab
Ramos.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Gori limited Ramos for a while, but was slowed by a right
knee bruise suffered in training last week and departed after 62
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The physicality of play, combined with the heat, turned the game
into a battle of attrition. Dan Calichman and Ted Chronopoulos both
departed because of exhaustion. MetroStars coach Bora Milutinovic
rejuvenated his team with Villegas and Kalonji, then brought
defender Kevin Knight in as an attacker in the final minutes.
</P>
<P>
   A MetroStars error led to Moore's first goal in the 21st minute.
Mike Petke struggled to control a pass just outside the penalty
area, allowing Chronopoulos to steal. Chronopoulos found Moore, who
converted his seventh goal of the season from about 15 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Savarese scored six minutes later, following an effective
buildup through McKinley. Moore laid off to Jair, who sent a hard
shot off the right post, and Savarese calmly scored on the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   But the Revolution appeared vulnerable defensively. Ramos looped
a pass to Mark Chung, who controlled the ball with his right foot,
stepped around Calichman, and finished with his left foot in the
29th minute. The MetroStars nearly tied six minutes later, but
Zenga saved a Chung shot off an Eduardo Hurtado feed. Zenga made
his best saves off a Chung header and a Hurtado breakaway in the
21st minute of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   This was a game the Revolution likely would not have won a year
ago. But they are changing expectations, and are being helped by
the failure of teams such as the MetroStars, who have won twice in
regulation time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played well for the first 20 minutes and capitalized on
their mistakes,'' Chronopoulos said. ``With New York being in our
division, this was like a 6-point turnaround.''

US WILL GET RUN FOR ITS MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Chinese were doing their best to remain
humble after humiliating Norway, 5-0, in a Women's World Cup
semifinal Sunday &UR;  &LR; night. But though the Asian nature is perceived
as having a significant passive, or ying quality, there is a
suspicion that these women's yang qualities are being given great
room for expression.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that China eliminated the defending champions was not
surprising, but the margin of victory and the seeming ease in which
it was achieved were a shock.
</P>
<P>
   China displayed excellent tactical awareness and technical
skill, and also seemed advanced enough athletically, and speedy
enough, to give the United States a run for its money in the final
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Norway never had been dismantled this badly, and seldom had
seemed to be playing from a position of weakness. The Norwegians
have shown an ability to play conservatively, defensively, and win
games in counterattack _ as they have against the US. But they
never have had to adopt a defensive mentality against any other
country, and were not about to start with China.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Norway's uninhibited willingness to go forward made this
a wide-open match. And, after China took a two-goal lead, the
Norwegians forced the issue even more, leaving even greater space
for the Chinese to exploit.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, at the beginning of the decade Norway might have
been the best team in the world. Now, China is challenging for that
label.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going one step at a time, one game at a time,'' China
coach Ma Yuanan said.
</P>
<P>
   At least this was the English translation, and it is a statement
that does not stir the imagination any more than another generic
cliche.
</P>
<P>
   But some 60 years ago, another great Chinese leader built a
movement on a similar proverb to change the face of their
civilization, leading his group on a long march that began with the
first step.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese women began this journey in 1993. They have advanced
relatively quickly, and accumulated more frequent flyer mileage
than Mao's troops. They will be at a perceived disadvantage
traveling across the US for Saturday's game, but their trip to Los
Angeles will be a relative breeze compared to the land campaigns of
their fathers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Chinese mentality also must be considered. The US
women's team has been taught to play attacking soccer, to set the
tone, to play aggressively, always to feel in a position of
strength. China, though, also appears to have this way of thinking.
The Chinese always have felt invincible, with the population and
resources to achieve anything.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese women have a high level of confidence, technique,
and team unity. They play with machine-like precision, but not with
assembly-line predictability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soccer is a game that, until you play, you don't know who is
going to win,'' Ma said. ``We are confident we will play a very
good game and we will see who will win Saturday.''

PEORIA, ARIZ., FIREWORKS EXPLODE, 2 WORKERS BADLY BURNED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LISA GONDERINGER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ariz. _ A popular fireworks display got off to an
accidental start Sunday in Peoria, sending five pyrotechnic workers
to the hospital, two with possibly life-threatening injuries, and
canceling the show.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion happened at 5 p.m., about an hour after crews
started setting up for the 9 p.m. extravaganza at the Peoria Sports
Complex. The event, staged by the city for four years, was expected
to draw as many as 20,000 spectators.
</P>
<P>
   But stacks of fireworks that workers from the Salt Lake
City-based Lantis Fireworks had unloaded in a field suddenly
started detonating, police and fire officials said.
</P>
<P>
   White smoke quickly covered the entire field, said Glendale
photographer Chris Powell, who had been setting up his camera at
the La Quinta hotel across the street. He had hoped to capture
images from the evening show for his portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of shooting into the sky, the fireworks launched across
the field, low to the ground, Powell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There must've been 50 to 60 explosions,'' Powell said.
</P>
<P>
   An empty field to the north of the stadium caught fire, and a
white van suddenly turned into a fireball, he said. Black smoke
blended with white.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion shook the windows of the house of Gena Zestrijan,
who lives a half-mile away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at home in the back yard with the kids in the pool and I
just started hearing, `Boom, boom,' and I knew it was fireworks,''
Zestrijan said.
</P>
<P>
   Peoria fire crews arrived minutes later and extinguished the van
and the field. Two workers were airlifted to the Maricopa County
Medical Center burn unit. They have critical burns over 75 percent
of their body, a fire official said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are withholding the victims' names until family
members have been notified.
</P>
<P>
   A third employee suffered less serious burns. Two other workers
were sent to Arrowhead Medical Center for smoke-inhalation
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The city canceled the night's festivities, said Kelly Corsette,
Peoria's public information officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``For one thing, we don't have any more fireworks left, and that
was the whole purpose of the show,'' Corsette said.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb squad was planning to search a parking lot and the area
around the explosion to make sure no hazards remained.
</P>
<P>
   The city has used Lantis Fireworks for other events, Corsette
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a professional outfit, they are fully certified,''
Corsette said. It's too early to say whether Sunday's accident
would cause the city to look elsewhere next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody really knows what happened here,'' Corsette said.
</P>
<P>
   Many spectators didn't get the news until they showed up at the
Peoria Sports Complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed, but we'll try to find a different place,''
said Glendale resident Rob Gassert, who was accompanied by his
wife, Heather, and their children Robbie and Brooke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, I hope the two people involved will get well
soon,'' he said. ``I think their health is more important than
fireworks.''
</P>
<P>
   The city is issuing refunds of the $5 admission to those who go
to Peoria City hall or call (623) 412-7137. &QL;

SCURRY ANSWER US CALL 
</HEADLINE>
 WOMEN-SCURRY-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ She would have preferred an afternoon spent
yawning and brushing cobwebs out of her eyes. The kind of afternoon
Briana Scurry gets more often than not while keeping goal for the
US women's soccer team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather have had an incredibly boring game,'' the former
University of Massachusetts star said, after she had blanked Brazil
for her third shutout of the World Cup tournament Sunday afternoon
and helped put her teammates into Saturday's final against China.
</P>
<P>
   But the Brazilians, who like keeping their hosts company,
wouldn't hear of it. Scurry had oddly-nicknamed visitors banging on
her door all day Sunday _ Pretinha, Cidinha, Nene twice in a row,
then Cidinha and Pretinha again.
</P>
<P>
   If Scurry had known they were coming, she might have served
punch and cookies. But then, she usually only had one hand
available. ``I'm just glad we were able to hold the fort,'' said
Scurry, after she'd made half a dozen saves and been named MVP of
the match. ``It was a bit dangerous at times, but we held it. I had
to do my job, and I'm glad I could do it. My parents finally got to
watch me in a World Cup game. I was happy I could do 'em proud.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been times during her six years on the line when
Scurry wondered whether she was earning her keep. Most days, the US
could play with a life-sized Austin Powers cutout between the posts
and not have to worry. But not now. Not when the Yanks are sweating
for goals. Not when yielding even one can send them home for the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   After the Brazilians gave them a gift in the fifth minute
Sunday, it seemed as if Scurry might be able to catch up on her
light reading. But when no more goals came and the Pretinhas and
Nenes came to call, Scurry was a one-woman highlight film.
</P>
<P>
   She came charging out to thwart Pretinha. She pushed Nene's
blast over the crossbar then, outstretched, palmed another Nene bid
away. ``I thought it was by me,'' Scurry said. ``That would have
been 1-1 and downhill from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after her mates had gone ahead, 2-0, 10 minutes from
time, Scurry swatted Pretinha again, just for emphasis. ``Thank God
she's on our team,'' Mia Hamm said. ``That's what I kept saying to
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Scurry has been there for 94 matches and 52 shutouts. These
days, though, she's more there than others. ``I said all along that
Bri could be the world's best keeper and she's proven that she's
the best in this Cup,'' said coach Tony DiCicco. ``We needed her
against Germany. We needed her today. And we'll need her in the
final.''

   PALESTINE-TV-REVIEW _ Edward Said, America's foremost
Palestinian patriot and polemicist, sets forth tonight on a journey
``In Search of Palestine.'' He carries a heavy load of memories of
a homeland that was taken by force, leaving many of its people in
refugee camps or under Israeli occupation. By Walter Goodman.

   SALEM, Ill. _ The man suspected in a two-state shooting rampage
that targeted Jews, blacks and Asian-Americans fatally shot himself
on Sunday night after police pursued him in rural southern
Illinois, an FBI spokesman in Salem, Ill., said early Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Benjamin Nathaniel Smith, 21, abandoned his blue
car at a truck stop in Salem and carjacked a van, said Doug
Garrison, an FBI spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was driving south while being chased by police and shot
himself, Garrison said. His car crashed off the road and he was
pronounced dead at a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials said they planned to check fingerprints to make
certain the body is Smith's, but Jim Kennedy, police chief in
Bloomington, Ind., said two guns found with the body were
consistent with two of the shootings _ in Bloomington and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   A light blue Taurus sought by police was also at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said the body had a tattoo on the chest that said
``Sabbath Breaker,'' which Smith was said to have.
</P>
<P>
   Smith had been the subject of the two-state search after
shootings that began Friday in Chicago. Police also said shootings
on Saturday in Springfield and Urbana _ as well as a killing on
Sunday in Bloomington _ appeared to be related.
</P>
<P>
   The latest victim was a Korean-American graduate student who was
killed on Sunday morning as he entered a church in Bloomington,
Ind. That followed an incident late Saturday in Urbana, in which an
Asian-American student at the University of Illinois was shot in
the leg.
</P>
<P>
   In an hourlong series of shootings in the Chicago area on Friday
night, a former basketball coach at Northwestern University, a
black man, was killed as he walked with his children in his
neighborhood, six Orthodox Jews were injured as they walked home
from Sabbath services and two Asian-Americans were shot at as they
sat in their car at an intersection.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man is on a spree,'' said Chicago Police Cmdr. William
Hayes. ``He's shooting people all over.''
</P>
<P>
   In most of the shootings, a white man slowly drove a blue car,
apparently prowling the streets for victims, and said nothing as he
fired, first one handgun, then another while he reloaded the
original, said Patrick T. Camden, a Chicago police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   In Indiana, the police there said, the man waited in his car and
fired as people entered the church. The police have found matching
shell casings at all the sites of the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, whose last known address was in Bloomington, matched the
general description of the killer, and owns a light blue Ford
Taurus with a license plate matching the car that was seen leaving
the Indiana shooting, Kennedy said. A similar car was used in the
earlier shootings, although no witness saw the license number.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the crimes did not yet fit the legal definition
of a hate crime, because they had no expression of hatred or motive
from the shooter.
</P>
<P>
   Groups that monitor racial violence say the Ku Klux Klan, white
supremacist churches and other groups with similar ideologies have
increased their membership dramatically in the Midwest in the
1990s. Smith had been a member of the World Church of the Creator,
an anti-black, anti-Christian, anti-Jewish organization based in
East Peoria, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the group, Matthew F. Hale, described Smith as
nonviolent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben always struck me as a very thoughtful person, very
intelligent,'' Hale, said in a telephone interview. ``I was struck
by his sincerity, his dedication and actually his coolheadedness.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a former Indiana University student, joined the Church of
the Creator in 1998 by paying $35 and pledging his ``undying
loyalty to the white race,'' Hale said. He attended meetings and
ordered large volumes of its literature attacking Jews and blacks,
Hale said, until his one-year membership lapsed in May. The group's
main publication is: ``Facts that the media and government don't
want you to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Hale has been fighting a well-publicized battle to obtain his
law license in Illinois. On Friday, his appeal was denied again by
a state administrative board, because of his racial views. The
shootings began that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have heard speculation from reporters that Ben was angry
about my appeal being denied, but I don't know if that's true,''
said Hale, who plans to appeal to the courts. ``He looked up to me
in a lot of ways because I was committed to the legal fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Hale said his organization neither condoned violence, nor
incited it. He said it did not advocate killing Jews and
non-whites. He proposes instead to ``crowd them off the planet in
self-defense,'' while ``straightening out the thinking of white
people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not in this for hatred,'' Hale said. ``We're here
because we love our own people, and want to protect it. We see the
white people as being raped. We're losing our culture. A lot of
people don't realize how angry the average white person is. We're
told to be ashamed that we're white. We're trying to choose the
legal path, but occasionally some people take a violent course.''
</P>
<P>
   The church, which does not worship any God, is opposed to other
organized religions and has faith only in the white race. Hale said
it supported the views of Hitler in many respects, but differed in
a few. He would not say how many members it has, but said they were
in 22 countries. Its Golden Rule: ``That which is good for the
White Race is the highest virtue. That which is bad for the White
Race is the ultimate sin.''

</P>
<P>
   The shootings began about 8:30 p.m. in Rogers Park, a northern
Chicago neighborhood with a large Jewish population and a mix of
races. Six Orthodox Jews walking home from Friday evening services
were shot in four locations. In the first case, the man stood on
the sidewalk and fired at a group of men. The later shootings were
done from a car. None of the wounds appeared to be
life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   The first person was killed less than hour later. Ricky
Byrdsong, 43, the former basketball coach, was shot once in the
back. At least six other shots missed his son and daughter, who
were walking with him near their home in Skokie, just north of
Chicago. Byrdsong, 43, had coached the Northwestern Wildcats for
four seasons, from 1994 to 1997. He also coached at Arizona,
Eastern Illinois, Western Michigan, Iowa State and Detroit Mercy.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, in Northbrook, about three miles northwest,
a man in a blue car fired shots at two Asian-American men in a car.
Neither was hit.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:30 a.m. Saturday in Springfield, Ill., south of Chicago,
two blacks were shot at, but not injured.
</P>
<P>
   In the shooting in Urbana Saturday night, a man in a blue car
fired several shots at a group of six Asian students on a corner
near dormitories and academic buildings, the police said. One was
hit in the leg and was in serious condition, the police said.
Urbana is about two hours east of Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   In Bloomington on Sunday morning, three hours southeast of
Urbana, a man fired four shots into a group of people leaving the
Korean United Methodist Church just before noon. Won-Joon Yoon, a
26-year-old student at the University of Indiana, was hit twice in
the back and killed, the Urbana police said. Witnesses told the
police that the shooter sped east in a blue Ford Taurus, running
several traffic lights.
</P>
<P>
   The Urbana police said they knew Smith, who distributed the
World Church's anti-Semitic literature in Bloomington last year. On
Sunday they issued a warrant for the former student.

   1. A NUCLEAR CONFLICT CAN HAVE NO VICTORS Pakistan's atomic
tests made South Asia more secure, writes its foreign secretary,
and helped prod India and Pakistan to better relations and talks on
Kashmir. By Shamshad Ahmad. From Foreign Affairs magazine. 1,000
words.
_____________________________________________________________ 2.
'ALL ARE BUT PARTS OF ONE STUPENDOUS WHOLE' Stephen J. Gould, a
professor of zoology at Harvard, who is the author, most recently,
of ``Questioning the Millennium,'' queries why humans need to see
themselves as separate and superior to the natural world and why,
for example, anyone would doubt the existence of a sophisticated
mental life in chimpanzees. New York Times Op-Ed. 800 words.
_____________________________________________________________ 3.
WHICH THREATS SHALL WE HEED? Nato's poorly planned adventure in
Kosovo has brought a critical question to the fore : Just how
should Americans define their national interest in the information
age? The Soviet Union is gone, and an information revolution has
transformed the nature of power. Few 'A list' threats to American
security loom large today. Global telecommunications have made
humanitarian crises in far-flung places impossible to ignore. But
before the U.S. embarks on another costly human rights crusade,
Americans should recognize that moral values are only part of a
foreign policy. Other essential priorities remain. If Washington
neglects to handle the ``A list,'' the consequences for global
peace and prosperity will be dire. By Joseph S. Nye Jr. From
Foreign Affairs magazine. 1,800 words.
_____________________________________________________________ 4.
THE MAN AFTER MANDELA During the 27 years that Nelson Mandela was
serving time in apartheid jails, his successor, Thabo Mbeki, was
also serving time, ``like a cosmic wanderer, driven by the winds to
land where they will,'' as he once wrote to a friend. Mbeki was
living in forced exile. Like Mandela, the decision to become a
freedom fighter would be as much destiny as it was choice. By
Charlayne Hunter-Gault. From Emerge magazine. 2,000 words.
_____________________________________________________________ 5.
FROM NEW SCIENTIST MAGAZINE (N/A Brazil, Australia, New Zealand) A.
Rough Justice What is a jury supposed to do when the prosecution's
expert witness flatly contradicts a scientist appearing for the
defence? Are court-appointed neutral experts the answer? By Nell
Boyce. 1,500 words. B. Left Brain, Right Brain If you thought one
side of your brain was cold and logical and the other creative and
emotional -- think again! By John McCrone. 4,500 words. C. Coral
Grief Dust from African deserts may be spreading disease across the
world's coral reefs, say researchers who also blame the fallout for
a global rise in respiratory infections. By Fred Pearce. 500 words.
D. Gamma Force They're scary, awesome and hard to control. Nuclear
lasers a million times more powerful than their conventional
cousins are no longer a crazy dream. By Marcus Chown. 4,000 words.
_____________________________________________________________ 6.
WHAT'S DOING IN VEVEY About every 20 years, the quaint Swiss
village of Vevey, on the northeastern shore of Lake Geneva, honours
a new generation of winemakers. Last held in 1977, the Fjte des
Vignerons has been sponsored by the local brotherhood of
winegrowers since the 17th century. This summer, more than half a
million visitors are expected to descend on tiny Vevey (population
16,000) for an 18-day extravaganza, from July 29 to August 15. By
Corinne LaBalme. From New York Times Way to Go! 1,800 words +
photos + map.
_____________________________________________________________ 7.
FROM NATURE NEWS SERVICE (N/A France and Spain. Embargo 19h00 BST
Wednesday July 7)
</P>
<P>
   A. Vaccination Against Alzheimer's Disease? A step towards a
clinically practical treatment against Alzheimer's disease is
reported in the latest issue of Nature. By Henry Gee. 500 words.
</P>
<P>
   B. Accident Theory Up In Smoke? When regular smokers quit, their
mood and mental abilities deteriorate within hours. This is
measurable in the laboratory - but is it systematically evident in
daily life? If it can be shown that sudden cessation of smoking
contributes to 'air rage' on long-haul flights, or poor performance
in a smoke-free workplace, then airlines and employers might have
to think about supplying nicotine patches to their addicted
passengers or colleagues. By Henry Gee. 800 words.

   &UR; THE OTHER SIDE OF SILENCE. MEN'S LIVES AND GAY IDENTITIES: A
TWENTIETH-CENTURY HISTORY &LR;  By John Loughery. John Macrae/Owl/Holt,
$15.95. This provocative chronicle of gay male life in the United
States from 1919 to the early 1990s combines extensive archival
research with interviews and a broad knowledge of 20th-century
letters. ``Loughery writes uncluttered, calm, controlled,
exceptionally intelligent prose,'' Warren Goldstein wrote in The
New York Times Book Review last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CITIES OF THE PLAIN: VOLUME 3, THE BORDER TRILOGY &LR;  By Cormac
McCarthy. Vintage International, $13. The concluding volume of the
author's sweeping cowboy saga brings together the two leathery
heroes from the earlier novels on a New Mexico ranch in the 1950s,
when the mythic West, and an entire way of life, are fading away.
Much of the plot involves romance: between one of the heroes and a
beautiful whore, and between ranchmen and their horses. McCarthy
``once again provides a terrific read,'' Sara Mosle wrote in 1998.
``He is perhaps the greatest writer since Melville on the subject
of work. ... What would be mind-numbing description in less
competent hands is here completely riveting.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INSIDE THE SKY: A MEDITATION ON FLIGHT &LR;  By William
Langewiesche. Vintage Departures, $12. These thoughtful essays by a
commercial pilot explore both the risks and the joys of flying, in
the process offering the reader a fresh way of perceiving the
world. ``Langewiesche brings knowledge and passion as well as
careful eloquence to his subject,'' James R. Gaines wrote in the
Book Review last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EAST TO THE DAWN: THE LIFE OF AMELIA EARHART &LR; , by Susan Butler
(Da Capo, $17.95), is a well-researched biography of the former
social worker (and truck driver) who in 1928 became the first woman
to fly across the Atlantic. In 1997 the reviewer Emily Wortis
Leider found the book to be overly adoring, but said that ``Butler
shows a mastery of aviation history, and considerable
sophistication about the technology of flight and navigation.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THIS TIME: NEW AND SELECTED POEMS &LR;  By Gerald Stern. Norton,
$14. This collection of verse, some of it reprinted from earlier
volumes, won a National Book Award in 1998. One critic called
Stern's book ``remarkable for its generosity of spirit, manifested
in a warm surrealism that is often turned with humor toward his own
past as a way of understanding the recurrent questions of growing
old.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ICY SPARKS &LR;  By Gwen Hyman Rubio. Penguin, $12.95. In this
poignant first novel, a hyperarticulate 10-year-old girl who is
both an orphan and a victim of Tourette's syndrome struggles to
come of age in rural Kentucky in the '50s. ``Rubio is a writer of
uncommonly warm and tender vision, often comic, brimming with love
and hope,'' Tara Bayton wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EXPLAINING HITLER: THE SEARCH FOR THE ORIGINS OF HIS EVIL &LR;  By
Ron Rosenbaum. Harper Perennial, $16. Does Hitler represent a
uniquely evil force or a grotesque perversion of basic human
nature? The author, an essayist and journalist, combs through the
many outposts of Hitler theory _ and the motives of the theorists
themselves _ to shed light on that enduring question. ``He has a
sympathetic ear, a knack for classification and a sharp, critical
mind,'' Michael R. Marrus wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BETWEEN DIGNITY AND DESPAIR: JEWISH LIFE IN NAZI GERMANY &LR; , by
Marion A. Kaplan (Oxford University, $14.95), relies on memoirs,
letters and interviews to create an intimate account of the social
isolation and unending acts of humiliation that plagued German
Jewry. Last year the reviewer Deborah E. Lipstadt called this ``a
devastatingly powerful book'' that reveals how ``genocidal violence
can have its genesis in the smallest expressions of prejudice and
hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LOST IN TRANSLATION &LR;  By Nicole Mones. Delta, $12.95. The
daughter of a racist American politician becomes intoxicated by
China (and Chinese men) and joins an expedition in search of the
bones of Peking Man. Last year the reviewer Lisa See called this a
``thought-provoking, sometimes disturbing and undeniably
entertaining'' first novel about race, taboo and cultural
attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE WOMAN OF ROME &LR;  By Alberto Moravia. Steerforth Italia, $16.
Adriana, the sympathetically drawn heroine of this Italian novel,
is a beautiful woman making her way in Mussolini-era Rome for whom
prostitution is not a desperate act but her natural vocation. In
1949 the reviewer William Fense Weaver found Adriana to be
``fascinating and original, as are all the characters.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SPLIT: A COUNTERCULTURE CHILDHOOD &LR;  By Lisa Michaels.
Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $13. A young poet and essayist recalls
growing up as the daughter of a Weatherman imprisoned in 1969 and a
gentle hippie mother with whom she migrated to California. The
result is ``an intelligent and vivid memoir of what it was like to
be literally a child of the '60s,'' Adam Goodheart wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MISSING WOMEN AND OTHERS: STORIES &LR;  By June Spence. Riverhead,
$12. Many of the characters in this first collection are women
mired in perpetual states of transition: recent divorce, recovery
from alcoholism, boring jobs or waiting out a lover's prison term.
``Spence has a canny eye and a pointed sense of humor,'' Laura
Miller wrote in 1998.

 &HT;    FIRST LANGUAGES: SURVIVAL OF THE MOST ARTICULATE
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - Understanding how a small number of pre-human
grunts and other sounds grew into complex modern languages is a
problem that has intrigued scientists for ages.
</P>
<P>
   Mathematical biologists in Princeton, N.J., now suggest that the
need to eliminate confusion would have pushed ``protolanguages'' of
modern humans' ancestors along increasingly complex paths, leading
to the development of modern verbal communication.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Nowak and David Krakauer of the Institute for Advanced
Study outline a mathematical theory to explain how language could
have developed as a natural extension of the evolution that led to
the development of living species.
</P>
<P>
   Linguists and neurobiologists have speculated for years about
the origin of languages. Some have tried to describe a naturally
occurring ``language instinct'' that caused human ancestors to
start exchanging information through recognizable sounds. Others
have speculated that some pre-existing activity, such as mutual
grooming, could have provided the environment in which audible
communication began.
</P>
<P>
   The random appearance of traits such as keener eyes or faster
feet increased the likelihood that the offspring of creatures with
those traits would survive, according to the theory of natural
selection propounded by Charles Darwin more than a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of audible signals _ such as a sound meaning
``leopard,'' for example _ would also have improved the chances
that human ancestors would survive and have offspring to whom they
could teach the signal, say Nowak and Krakauer in an article
appearing Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the keener eyes or faster feet, however, the sound for
leopard requires more than the ability of one creature to produce
it. A second creature must understand it.
</P>
<P>
   This requirement for cooperation tends to inhibit innovation and
is the first barrier to language evolution, Krakauer said in a
telephone interview. But the pressure of the need to eliminate
mistakes would overcome the resistance to innovation and push the
protolanguage to label more and more things and events with sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the system would reach the first of a pair of
``error thresholds,'' Krakauer said.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of new sounds to describe additional objects
increases the power of this protolanguage, but it also increases
the probability of making mistakes by confusing different sounds,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The need to avoid such mistakes is a key force pushing the
development of language, according to the theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way to overcome the error limit is by combining sounds
into words,'' Krakauer said.
</P>
<P>
   This process, which permits construction of an essentially
unlimited number of words, eventually takes the developing language
to its second error threshold.
</P>
<P>
   The second limit is defined not by the ear's ability to
distinguish among a huge number of similar sounds, but by the
mind's capacity for memorizing all of the words for all of the
different facts that need to be communicated.
</P>
<P>
   The natural response to the second threshold, Krakauer said, is
to develop rules for constructing sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grammar emerges in the attempt to convey more information by
combining these words into phrases or sentences,'' Krakauer and
Nowak say in the article. ``Simply naming an object will be less
valuable than naming it and describing its action. A leopard can be
stalking, in which case it is a serious risk, or merely sleeping
and thereby posing a lesser risk.''
</P>
<P>
   That way, instead of memorizing a forever-growing list of words,
the people who use a language must memorize a fairly large list of
words and a few rules for combining those words into meaningful
sentences.
</P>
<P>
   The theory does not try to compute how rapidly this evolution of
communication would occur.
</P>
<P>
   Krakauer said he and Nowak are at work on further mathematical
models which will incorporate other variables, such as the relative
importance of different words.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute for Advanced Study is an independent center
founded in 1930 to support study in a range of areas. Among its
earliest scholars was Albert Einstein.

SCENE OF THE CRIME: KOJAK WOULD RECOGNIZE KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 996-0089)  
 (bl)  
 By JOHN KIFNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DJAKOVICA, Yugoslavia _ Kosovo is a huge crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   Homicide and arson are at the heart of the charges, and at first
blush the evidence seems obvious, scattered across the landscape in
the form of burned-out buildings and bodies. The bodies keep
turning up, day after day, and are expected now to number 10,000 or
more.
</P>
<P>
   But meeting the exacting standards of a court of law _ even an
international tribunal focused on the highly emotional category of
war crimes _ is a different matter. For there are still specific
criminal acts to be proved, and a chain of evidence to be
established before Yugoslavia's top leaders can be held to account
for the killing that went on here. And these are cold scenes _ the
bodies burned, deteriorated, buried or in some instances even
stolen by the departing Serbs to destroy evidence. The sites have
been open to the elements, sometimes for more than two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like working a massive homicide,'' said Art Eberhart of
the FBI, ``except usually you have a pristine site. You are there
within 24 hours and nobody has touched anything. You tape it off
and attempt to recreate the crime.''
</P>
<P>
   At many of the sites under investigation here, the houses had
been burned to a shell, with rafters, second story and roof tile
now just piles of bits of rubble 6 to 10 inches thick, Eberhart
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to excavate by hand, tile by tile,'' said Bill
Rodriguez, a forensic anthropologist on the FBI team. ``There were
no intact sites because of burning. Everything had collapsed on
itself. Even to get at the evidence you have to excavate very
carefully. You can't go in there willy-nilly or you'll destroy the
evidence. There are hundreds of bone fragments, burned, highly
fragmented. They could be crushed in your hand very easily.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, another important difference, said detectives
and other investigators from a half-dozen countries working for the
International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. The
question to be answered in Kosovo is not exactly who pulled the
trigger or struck the match in each case.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, these investigators are trying to corroborate the
accounts of witnesses about the pattern of the killings by Serb
forces, to establish that war crimes and crimes against humanity
did, in fact, occur. That is what would back up the indictment
already issued against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and
four other Serbian leaders. They are accused of command
responsibility for a campaign of terror and violence against
Kosovo's Albanians that included deportation, murder and
persecution, all crimes against humanity. A fourth count cites the
commission of murder as a violation of the laws of war.
</P>
<P>
   The forensic teams have initially been assigned to the six sites
mentioned in the indictment. But they are uncovering new evidence
of mass killings every day; many will not be fully investigated,
officials say. Others might figure in new indictments, possibly of
lower-ranking figures on whom pressure could be applied to obtain
their testimony against Milosevic and others up the chain of
command.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to link, say, shell casings to a specific
individual,'' said Eberhart, who headed one of two FBI forensic
teams investigating sites in Djakovica, where the Serbs
concentrated some of their greatest fury against ethnic Albanians.
``We're trying to show that a crime occurred here, in order to
support the witness statements.''
</P>
<P>
   Police officers are normally wary of eyewitnesses, knowing they
can often be contradictory, their stories clouded by emotion or
inaccurate observations. But in Kosovo, the investigators have been
struck, as have journalists, by the accuracy of the refugees'
accounts. On the ground, the crime scenes are precisely what has
been described. ``Everyone you talk to has a story,'' said Chris
Whitcomb, another FBI agent on the team. ``And when you see the
evidence, you know they are not exaggerating.''
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen miles away, in a field by a stream near the village
of Bela Crkva, John Bunn, chief superintendent of Scotland Yard,
concurred. He is heading a 16-member British team investigating
mass graves in a chain of villages along a 10-mile stretch of
highway between Djakovica and Prizren.
</P>
<P>
   ``The witness accounts are very, very good, and they're true, no
doubt about that,'' said Bunn, a portly figure who prefers to be
called ``detective,'' and looked as if he had stepped out of an

   ``At a crime scene, there is always something for you to find,''
Bunn said, brushing aside the difficulties in matter-of-fact tones.
``We can establish cause of death, we can still work out the last
few minutes of these people.''
</P>
<P>
   But difficulties abound, among them the proliferation of bodies.
Conversely, the French team went to a remote hillside by the
village of Izbice expecting to find 160 bodies at a well-documented
mass grave _ it had been photographed by satellite _ only to find
that the Serbs had dug it up and made off with the corpses.

<P>
   The FBI mounted one of the most elaborate forensic efforts in
Kosovo, with a 65-person team that included a security patrol from
its hostage rescue unit and 107,000 pounds of equipment, including
humvees, trucks, tents and communications equipment. There were
graphic artists and demolition experts. Each site _ they examined
seven in addition to the two originally assigned _ was photographed
and videotaped at each stage of the investigation. Elaborate charts
that resembled architectural drawings were made, and evidence
collected in grocery store-sized paper bags, labeled by location.
Generators powered an X-ray machine, which was needed because the
victims' flesh had deteriorated. Still, the team had to improvise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exposure to the elements really puts you behind the ball,''
said Rodriguez, one of two experts on loan from the Armed Forces
Institute of Pathology. ``Trying to play catch-up on something so
old is difficult. Much of the material is literally burned up. The
FBI had some really good improvisers and they scavenged raw
materials, doors, bed frames to create a makeshift morgue. There
was no running water, no ventilation, the smell was staggering,
flies all over you. It was very difficult to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Even a serial killer, one agent said, kills only a dozen or so
victims. This crime was different; the indictment says it involved
leaders of a nation who issued orders for their army, police and
wild bands of ultranationalists to kill thousands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We proved these crimes, I have no doubt about that,'' said
Eberhart as the FBI team packed up last week. ``Unless you've seen
it with your own eyes, you would never believe it.''

SCENE OF THE CRIME: KOJAK WOULD RECOGNIZE KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   DJAKOVICA, Yugoslavia _ Kosovo is a huge crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   Homicide and arson are at the heart of the charges, and at first
blush the evidence seems obvious, scattered across the landscape in
the form of burned-out buildings and bodies. The bodies keep
turning up, day after day, and are expected now to number 10,000 or
more.
</P>
<P>
   But meeting the exacting standards of a court of law _ even an
international tribunal focused on the highly emotional category of
war crimes _ is a different matter. For there are still specific
criminal acts to be proved, and a chain of evidence to be
established before Yugoslavia's top leaders can be held to account
for the killing that went on here. And these are cold scenes _ the
bodies burned, deteriorated, buried or in some instances even
stolen by the departing Serbs to destroy evidence. The sites have
been open to the elements, sometimes for more than two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like working a massive homicide,'' said Art Eberhart of
the FBI, ``except usually you have a pristine site. You are there
within 24 hours and nobody has touched anything. You tape it off
and attempt to recreate the crime.''
</P>
<P>
   At many of the sites under investigation here, the houses had
been burned to a shell, with rafters, second story and roof tile
now just piles of bits of rubble 6 to 10 inches thick, Eberhart
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to excavate by hand, tile by tile,'' said Bill
Rodriguez, a forensic anthropologist on the FBI team. ``There were
no intact sites because of burning. Everything had collapsed on
itself. Even to get at the evidence you have to excavate very
carefully. You can't go in there willy-nilly or you'll destroy the
evidence. There are hundreds of bone fragments, burned, highly
fragmented. They could be crushed in your hand very easily.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, another important difference, said detectives
and other investigators from a half-dozen countries working for the
International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. The
question to be answered in Kosovo is not exactly who pulled the
trigger or struck the match in each case.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, these investigators are trying to corroborate the
accounts of witnesses about the pattern of the killings by Serb
forces, to establish that war crimes and crimes against humanity
did, in fact, occur. That is what would back up the indictment
already issued against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and
four other Serbian leaders. They are accused of command
responsibility for a campaign of terror and violence against
Kosovo's Albanians that included deportation, murder and
persecution, all crimes against humanity. A fourth count cites the
commission of murder as a violation of the laws of war.
</P>
<P>
   The forensic teams have initially been assigned to the six sites
mentioned in the indictment. But they are uncovering new evidence
of mass killings every day; many will not be fully investigated,
officials say. Others might figure in new indictments, possibly of
lower-ranking figures on whom pressure could be applied to obtain
their testimony against Milosevic and others up the chain of
command.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to link, say, shell casings to a specific
individual,'' said Eberhart, who headed one of two FBI forensic
teams investigating sites in Djakovica, where the Serbs
concentrated some of their greatest fury against ethnic Albanians.
``We're trying to show that a crime occurred here, in order to
support the witness statements.''
</P>
<P>
   Police officers are normally wary of eyewitnesses, knowing they
can often be contradictory, their stories clouded by emotion or
inaccurate observations. But in Kosovo, the investigators have been
struck, as have journalists, by the accuracy of the refugees'
accounts. On the ground, the crime scenes are precisely what has
been described. ``Everyone you talk to has a story,'' said Chris
Whitcomb, another FBI agent on the team. ``And when you see the
evidence, you know they are not exaggerating.''
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen miles away, in a field by a stream near the village
of Bela Crkva, John Bunn, chief superintendent of Scotland Yard,
concurred. He is heading a 16-member British team investigating
mass graves in a chain of villages along a 10-mile stretch of
highway between Djakovica and Prizren.
</P>
<P>
   ``The witness accounts are very, very good, and they're true, no
doubt about that,'' said Bunn, a portly figure who prefers to be
called ``detective,'' and looked as if he had stepped out of an
Agatha Christie novel in his shin-high black rubber gardening
boots. He had been camped in a tent by the stream, where executions
had been described by Isuf Zhenigi, a survivor. The detective
pointed out two mounds of earth where, with the help of tearful
villagers, he had exhumed 34 bodies,
</P>

few minutes of these people.''

DEMOCRATS TRY PITCHING TO MATERNAL INSTINCTS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At a news conference recently in one of the
Capitol's many gilded chambers, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md.,
offered a myriad of reasons why a Democratic proposal to give
patients new rights within their health insurance plans made sense.
She spoke of longer hospital stays, greater access to specialists,
better overall care.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most intriguing part of her sales pitch was a
less technical one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Health care is a women's issue,'' Ms. Mikulski told an
audience of several dozen reporters. ``Women will do anything to
make sure their children have the kind of health care they need.''
</P>
<P>
   In a few sentences, Ms. Mikulski equated being a woman with
being a mother. She thereby underscored a peculiar paradox in
Democratic politics right now: The party that fought hard to make
sure women were not defined simply as the bearers and rearers of
children is spending an awful lot of energy these days casting
women in those terms, or at least appealing to them along those
lines.
</P>
<P>
   That is a tack evident in the Democrats' continuing debate with
Republicans over how extensively to regulate health maintenance
organizations and other health insurance providers. Democrats, for
example, are insisting on a measure that gives women _ but not men
_ the right to choose a specialist as a primary doctor.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just any specialist a woman can choose. It is an
obstetrician-gynecologist, the caretaker of her reproductive health
and her ascent to motherhood.
</P>
<P>
   Motherhood was also the backdrop of Democrats' oratory in the
recent debate over gun control. Their plea for new restrictions on
firearms was framed not in terms of slain police officers or
Uzi-toting drug dealers, but in terms of child safety.
</P>
<P>
   While that partly reflected the series of shootings at public
schools that had given the issue new momentum, Democrats conceded
that it also took into account internal polls that showed that
women were more likely to support new gun control measures than men
were.
</P>
<P>
   And it hinged on the thinking that the easiest, most visceral
way to reach women was to tap their maternal instincts.
</P>
<P>
   ``A woman may have a unique perspective on how to protect and
nurture our children,'' said Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lowey belonged to a trio of female lawmakers in the House
who held news conferences just about every other day to reiterate
the statistic that 13 children in America die from gun violence
every day.
</P>
<P>
   It was a pitch made to women, by women, on the tacit assumption
that they spoke the same language. ``These issues resonate with
women,'' Ms. Lowey said, ``because mothers worry about their
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Christina Hoff Sommers is the author of the 1994 book ``Who
Stole Feminism?'' She does not quibble with the assessment. In
fact, she believes there are intrinsic differences between women
and men, and that women are indeed more interested in child
rearing. But Ms. Sommers, now a fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute, a conservative research center, said she found some
irony in the fact that Democrats were making such arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one moment, they're deploring the stereotypes, and at the
next, they're exploiting them,'' Ms. Sommers said, noting a change
over the last two decades in the thrust of Democrats' appeals to
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early on, there was more of a commitment to the idea that the
sexes were interchangeable,'' she said. ``Now they market all of
their family-friendly policies to women. You don't have to be a
logician to note the inconsistency in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Democrats aren't doing anything that Republicans
haven't done, but Republicans never cried out for women to be
unshackled from the constraints of motherhood with quite the vigor
that Democrats did.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are also simply showing themselves to be in synch with
the part of the women's movement that has altered its emphasis from
repelling any reductive, sex-based assumptions about women to
advocating policies that help women balance the demands of career
and motherhood.
</P>
<P>
   The latter is often portrayed as an inevitable, universal
aspiration, despite the fact that more women than ever are not
having children. For example, in 1995, the most recent year for
which the Census Bureau provides such a breakdown, 17.5 percent of
women between the ages of 40 and 44 had not had children. Two
decades earlier, that figure was just 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But those numbers also confirm that the vast majority of women
still indeed become mothers, and while polls show that Democrats
have a pronounced advantage among young, single, childless women,
the competition with Republicans for the votes of married women
with children is unpredictable and keen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters tend to become more Republican in their thinking when
blessed with what I like to call the three M's _ mortgage, marriage
and munchkins,'' said Kellyanne Fitzpatrick, a Republican pollster.
</P>
<P>
   So Democrats are waging a particularly spirited fight on that
battleground, and Democratic political consultants noted that the
one thing shared by all these mothers _ richer or poorer, suburban
or rural _ is the responsibility of child rearing, and the worries
that accompany it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how many ads we did last year using kids,''
said Rachel Gorlin, a Democratic media consultant, referring to
both state and national campaigns. That parade of children, she
added, was in pursuit of the women's vote in particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that women define themselves only in terms of their
kids,'' Ms. Gorlin said. ``But if you're looking for an
across-the-board touchstone to reach the largest number of women,
this is probably a good way to do it. At a certain point, this is
universal.''
</P>
<P>
   To acknowledge that, Ms. Gorlin said, was not to reduce women
simply to being mothers, but to recognize reality: that the act and
obligations of parenting remained bigger parts of women's lives
than of men's.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a gross generalization,'' Ms. Gorlin said, ``but women
are more preoccupied, regardless of what they do for a living, with
the issue of child-rearing.''

REDEFINING BUSH-LEAGUE FUND RAISING 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even though he has done it faster than anyone else,
Gov. George W. Bush is not the first Texan to raise several
gazillion dollars to run for president. He is the sixth or seventh,
depending on whether you count Lloyd Bentsen.
</P>
<P>
   Put aside Ross Perot, as Bush's father would have liked to do in
1992, because the cranky billionaire's chief fund-raising device
was his personal checkbook. After that, Gov. Bush's broad-brimmed
$36.3 million, even adjusted for inflation, puts most other Texans
in the shade, though not Lyndon B. Johnson and George Bush the
elder.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson spent $10.5 million in 1964, according to Herbert E.
Alexander, professor emeritus at the University of Southern
California and founder of the Citizens Research Foundation, a
nonpartisan group that studies campaign finance. In 1999 dollars
that is about $56 million. But almost all of it went for the
general election, after Johnson had run surrogates against Alabama
Gov. George C. Wallace in three Democratic primaries.
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, Gov. Bush has probably raised more money at this
point in the fund-raising cycle than any previous candidate for
president. Even if Bush's pace slackens a bit, he should pass
Johnson's total by Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is Perot's 1992 total of $67 million, mostly for general
election costs, out of Bush's reach _ not even when adjusted to $79
million in current dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But the most telling comparisons are not with either of those
Texans.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Perot spent his own money and Johnson ran before
there were any real limits on campaign financing, especially the
$1,000 cap on individual contributions to candidates _ a limit Bush
said last week he wanted raised, although he didn't specify a
figure.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen ran for the Democratic nomination in 1976 and
spent about $2.25 million ($6.5 million in 1999 dollars) before
giving up as the caucuses and primaries were beginning.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous case of a Texan being the political equivalent
of all hat and no cattle is John B. Connally. A former Democratic
governor, he had never been elected to anything as a Republican,
but raised $13.7 million to run in the Republican primaries in
1980. That's $38 million in today's dollars, a figure Bush will
pass sometime in July.
</P>
<P>
   But Connally's blustery campaign never caught on, and he won
only a single delegate, Ada Mills, for many years the treasurer of
the Arkansas Republican Party. Mrs. Mills became known as the ``$10
million delegate'' (a nice round number), and is living in
Clarksville, Ark., no longer active in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Finally there was Sen. Phil Gramm in 1996. He raised $13 million
by May 1995 and was eagerly advertising his money-raising skills.
They didn't do him much good; he was spending money almost as fast
as it came in, partly because his message of Republican populism
conflicted with his opulent fund raising and partly because Patrick
Buchanan had a better pitchfork. Gramm ultimately spent $25 million
and won 10 delegates, proving minimally more effective than
Connally.
</P>
<P>
   It will not be hard for Bush to get delegates more cheaply than
Gramm, who paid $2.5 million apiece. Dozens of Republican officials
who are sure to be delegates are already pledged to him.
</P>
<P>
   The money he has raised so far is not more than anyone has ever
spent to win a nomination. Bill Clinton reported spending $36.4
million in 1996 while Bob Dole spent $37.4 million (each amount
supplemented by national committee spending).
</P>
<P>
   Adjusted for inflation, Dole's spending equals $39.6 million
today, and the Clinton total $38.3 million. Those figures include
federal matching money, which does not become available until the
election year itself.
</P>
<P>
   There is no reason to think that Bush will stop raising money,
and he has more than a year to do so before the national
convention. Even if he did stop, enough money would probably
trickle in to allow him to exceed his father's standards. The elder
Bush spent $19 million in 1980 and lost the presidential
nomination, $27.6 million in 1988 and won it, and $32.7 million in
1992 and won it.
</P>
<P>
   Adjusted for inflation those sums equal $38.1 million, $38.5
million and $38.5 million in 1999 dollars. They are similar because
the elder Bush accepted federal matching funds, and that obliged
him to abide by federal spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   Bush the younger will almost certainly not take the federal
money and will spend as much as he can.

REDEFINING BUSH-LEAGUE FUND RAISING

   WASHINGTON _ Even though he has done it faster than anyone else,
Gov. George W. Bush is not the first Texan to raise several
gazillion dollars to run for president. He is the sixth or seventh,
depending on whether you count Lloyd Bentsen.
</P>
<P>
   Put aside Ross Perot, as Bush's father would have liked to do in
1992, because the cranky billionaire's chief fund-raising device
was his personal checkbook. After that, Gov. Bush's broad-brimmed
$36.3 million, even adjusted for inflation, puts most other Texans
in the shade, though not Lyndon B. Johnson and George Bush the
elder.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson spent $10.5 million in 1964, according to Herbert E.
Alexander, professor emeritus at the University of Southern
California and founder of the Citizens Research Foundation, a
nonpartisan group that studies campaign finance. In 1999 dollars
that is about $56 million. But almost all of it went for the
general election, after Johnson had run surrogates against Alabama
Gov. George C. Wallace in three Democratic primaries.
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, Gov. Bush has probably raised more money at this
point in the fund-raising cycle than any previous candidate for
president. Even if Bush's pace slackens a bit, he should pass
Johnson's total by Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is Perot's 1992 total of $67 million, mostly for general
election costs, out of Bush's reach _ not even when adjusted to $79
million in current dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But the most telling comparisons are not with either of those
Texans.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Perot spent his own money and Johnson ran before
there were any real limits on campaign financing, especially the
$1,000 cap on individual contributions to candidates _ a limit Bush
said last week he wanted raised, although he didn't specify a
figure.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen ran for the Democratic nomination in 1976 and
spent about $2.25 million ($6.5 million in 1999 dollars) before
giving up as the caucuses and primaries were beginning.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous case of a Texan being the political equivalent
of all hat and no cattle is John B. Connally. A former Democratic
governor, he had never been elected to anything as a Republican,
but raised $13.7 million to run in the Republican primaries in
1980. That's $38 million in today's dollars, a figure Bush will
pass sometime in July.
</P>
<P>
   But Connally's blustery campaign never caught on, and he won
only a single delegate, Ada Mills, for many years the treasurer of
the Arkansas Republican Party. Mrs. Mills became known as the ``$10
million delegate'' (a nice round number), and is living in
Clarksville, Ark., no longer active in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Finally there was Sen. Phil Gramm in 1996. He raised $13 million
by May 1995 and was eagerly advertising his money-raising skills.
They didn't do him much good; he was spending money almost as fast
as it came in, partly because his message of Republican populism
conflicted with his opulent fund raising and partly because Patrick
Buchanan had a better pitchfork. Gramm ultimately spent $25 million
and won 10 delegates, proving minimally more effective than
Connally.
</P>
<P>
   It will not be hard for Bush to get delegates more cheaply than
Gramm, who paid $2.5 million apiece. Dozens of Republican officials
who are sure to be delegates are already pledged to him.
</P>
<P>
   The money he has raised so far is not more than anyone has ever
spent to win a nomination. Bill Clinton reported spending $36.4
million in 1996 while Bob Dole spent $37.4 million (each amount
supplemented by national committee spending).
</P>
<P>
   Adjusted for inflation, Dole's spending equals $39.6 million
today, and the Clinton total $38.3 million. Those figures include
federal matching money, which does not become available until the
election year itself.
</P>
<P>
   There is no reason to think that Bush will stop raising money,
and he has more than a year to do so before the national
convention. Even if he did stop, enough money would probably
trickle in to allow him to exceed his father's standards. The elder
Bush spent $19 million in 1980 and lost the presidential
nomination, $27.6 million in 1988 and won it, and $32.7 million in
1992 and won it.
</P>
<P>
   Adjusted for inflation those sums equal $38.1 million, $38.5
million and $38.5 million in 1999 dollars. They are similar because
the elder Bush accepted federal matching funds, and that obliged
him to abide by federal spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   Bush the younger will almost certainly not take the federal
money and will spend as much as he can.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Toward the end of the Balkans air war, rarely a day
passed when NATO did not triumphantly declare that allied warplanes
had destroyed several more Yugoslav tanks or artillery pieces with
precision-guided bombs or missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Now it turns out that perhaps one-quarter of those weapons that
looked fearsome from 15,000 feet up were nothing more than artfully
designed decoys meant to fool allied pilots. Indeed, the Serb
military, outgunned by a technologically superior foe, proved to a
master of camouflage, concealment and deception.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav commanders built ``tanks'' of wood and plastic
sheeting, sometimes draping them with camouflage netting. To trick
thermal sensors, they put metal tape or plates on some decoys and
even set trays of water inside them that heated up in the sun, just
like a real tank would.
</P>
<P>
   Some suspected artillery revetments turned out to be disguised
pits, empty but for a long tube protruding toward the sky. And to
the dismay of the NATO air commanders, several Yugoslav MiG-21
fighter jets emerged from hidden caves once the war was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the big surprises was the extent to which the Yugoslav
military was able to use ground decoys to cause us to strike
targets that weren't real,'' said one senior Defense Department
official.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the air campaign's overall results were still
devastating and no doubt instrumental in forcing Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to cry uncle and withdraw his forces from
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But the phony targets have become a sore point with NATO's
military commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, who now says the alliance
destroyed 110 of the roughly 300 tanks that Yugoslavia poured into
Kosovo, not the 150 tanks NATO initially thought it blasted into
scrap.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, our pilots recognized those decoys,'' Clark
bristled last week. ``There is a concerted disinformation campaign
underway by the government of Yugoslavia to protect the reputation
of its armed forces and to diminish the reputation of NATO's air
power campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet one of the emerging lessons from the air war is that
low-technology countermeasures can still fool high-technology
weaponry and sensors enough of the time to make a difference. ``The
history of warfare suggests there are always countermeasures, and
human ingenuity will find its way,'' said Eliot A. Cohen, a
professor at Johns Hopkins who directed the Air Force's definitive
study of the 1991 Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, even as most of the military pushes the
envelope on futuristic warplanes, warships and battle tanks, and
clamors for more and more accurate cruise missiles and other smart
weapons, a new directorate in the Pentagon's Atlantic Command in
Norfolk, Va., is examining another set of concerns: How do
sophisticated warplanes detect concealed, mobile targets and
distinguish the right targets from mock-ups?
</P>
<P>
   One of the directorate's big efforts over the next two decades
will be to enhance a wide array of existing heat-sensing,
photographic and other sensors that verify a target is really what
it appears to be, and then speed that information to pilots firing
missiles or dropping bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Unmanned surveillance drones, for example, played a new and
important role in Kosovo, instantly sending battlefield images back
to allied command posts and targeting experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't think about things like we did 15 or 20 years ago,''
said Maj. Gen. Timothy Peppe, an Air Force officer who heads the
Atlantic Command's new joint experimentation directorate.
``Potential adversaries recognize our dominance in many areas,
especially in precision weapons, so they'll look to thwart that.''
</P>
<P>
   Deception and concealment have been a part of warfare since the
Trojan horse. In the Persian Gulf war, allied pilots hit a lot of
dummy mobile Scud missile launchers, largely because even U.S.
commandoes on the ground couldn't tell actual launchers from fake
ones until they were about 25 yards away.
</P>
<P>
   Low technology has also been employed effectively in weaponry to
stymie a more powerful army. Somali militiamen jury-rigged
rocket-propelled grenades to shoot down U.S. helicopters in
Mogadishu. In the Balkans air war, commanders held the Army's
premier tank-killing weapon, the Apache helicopter, out of combat
because they feared the gunships were too vulnerable to
shoulder-fired missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs used a long-shot, low-tech set of tactics to shoot down an
Air Force F-117 stealth fighter, starting with spies monitoring the
plane's takeoffs from Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Land mines are the weapon of choice of many developing nations
to thwart more technologically advanced armies. Indeed, one of the
first and most dangerous jobs for NATO peacekeepers in Kosovo has
been to identify and disarm thousands of mines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our very sophisticated technology can be easily
upset,'' said Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., who heads the House
Intelligence Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is fair to say that the United States helped write the
modern book on deception when it used decoys to fool German aerial
reconnaissance in the run-up to D-Day with its mockups of tanks and
landing craft left visible in southeastern England, seeming to
threaten Calais rather than Normandy.
</P>
<P>
   Which raises the question, why are these kinds of ploys still so
effective? ``Most of our sensors can't see inside things,''
explained Michael O'Hanlon, a national security analyst at the
Brookings Institution. ``It's usually cheaper and easier for
someone who's creative to fool a sensor.''
</P>
<P>
   And with U.S. commanders relying more on remote sensors and
long-distance weapons to pinpoint targets and spare pilot
casualties, the likelihood remains that even the best pilots and
most advanced missiles will get duped every now and then.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In announcing last week that the federal budget
surplus would be even more over the next 15 years _ a mind-boggling
$1 trillion _ than anticipated a few months ago, President Clinton
likened the government to a profligate consumer suddenly endowed
with the means and discipline to get out of debt and save for the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have now cut up Washington's credit card,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The actual American consumer, however, is not nearly so fiscally
virtuous. Minutes before Clinton said the Treasury might be able to
pay off the most important component of the national debt by 2015,
the Commerce Department released statistics showing that consumers
are headed in the other direction by spending more money than they
earn.
</P>
<P>
   The rate of personal savings turned negative last year; total
personal spending exceeded total after-tax income. Even as the
economy roared along, with jobs plentiful, wages rising and
inflation dormant, the savings rate declined to minus 1.2 percent
in May from minus 1.0 percent in April, the lowest since the
Depression.
</P>
<P>
   The public-private dichotomy may not be quite as stark as it
seems. Reaping huge government budget surpluses and wiping out the
national debt are just a hope at this point. Everything depends on
some sunny economic assumptions and revenue forecasts proving true
(the track record so far is not encouraging), and on Washington's
willingness to keep its appetite for tax cuts and new spending in
check (ditto).
</P>
<P>
   For their part, consumers are not quite so irresponsible as the
savings figures suggest. Although they are amassing debt, their
overall financial condition is not deteriorating, in large part
because the stock market boom and rising real estate values are
making them wealthier, at least on paper, even if their cash flow
is out of whack. The technical definition of savings includes bank
deposits and money invested in stocks, bonds or retirement savings
_ basically any after-tax income that a consumer does not spend.
But it does not include the capital gains on investments or
retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the contrast between promised government rectitude and
personal profligacy is jarring. And it was not the only discordant
note last week in economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, Clinton was making the case that one of the
great benefits of fiscal responsibility and debt reduction is lower
interest rates, since the government's reduced borrowing needs
leaves more capital available for businesses and consumers. On the
other, the Federal Reserve was raising rates to snuff out any
smoldering inflationary pressures generated by an economy that is
already red hot.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters even more complicated, the updated surplus
projections led Republicans to step up their push for a big tax
cut, which if enacted would stoke the economy even as the Fed is
trying to cool it off. (To add to the conundrum, Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan is one of the most fervent advocates in Washington of
lower taxes. Congress is likely to heed his call for another cut in
the capital gains tax, which would further fuel the turbo-charged
stock market, whose lofty valuations have been keeping Greenspan
awake at night for years.)
</P>
<P>
   There's good news, though. These apparent quandaries are the
interwoven byproducts of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Take the issue of personal savings and national debt. Arguably,
the government owes its opportunity to reduce the debt to
consumers, who as much as any other force have kept the economy and
the stock market steaming along and generating the flood of tax
revenues that has transformed deficit into surplus.
</P>
<P>
   To the degree that Americans are spendthrifts, it is because
they are confident about their own prospects. By opening their
wallets, they are creating jobs and fomenting competition that
leads to innovation and efficiency. And while their credit card
balances might be a bit steep, their household balance sheets are
quite healthy if assets like stocks and houses are taken into
account.
</P>
<P>
   The ratio of household liabilities to net worth actually
declined a bit between 1988 and 1998, to 16.7 percent from 16.9
percent, according to Federal Reserve figures assembled by Dresdner
Kleinwort Benson, an investment firm based in London. Rising debt
was more than offset by an increase in assets, especially stocks,
which last year accounted for a quarter of all household assets, up
from 10 percent a decade earlier.
</P>
<P>
   A negative savings rate is indeed a potential problem in the
long run, and it is only one of several imbalances that have
developed over the course of the long business expansion. Should
joblessness rise or the stock market head south, households might
quickly find themselves on the financial precipice. The same
dynamic could apply to the rapidly growing trade deficit, which so
far has been a symbol of the U.S. economy's strength and its
ability to absorb imports. A downturn could expose the deficit as a
weakness of serious proportions.
</P>
<P>
   But even looking narrowly at the savings rate, the news there is
not all bad.
</P>
<P>
   While personal savings is in free fall, the overall national
savings rate _ by far the more important economic indicator _ has
been rising. That is because the government has become a ``saver''
in economic terms in the past few years as budget deficits have
turned to surpluses and the Treasury has begun paying down the
national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the question of whether debt reduction is even the
best way to use the fiscal windfall. Mainstream economic thought
says yes. That position dovetails with the broad political
consensus that a crucial component to shoring up the ailing
entitlement programs, Social Security and Medicare, is getting the
government on sounder financial footing before the vast baby-boom
generation retires.
</P>
<P>
   But some conservatives say focusing on paying down the debt
dilutes support for tax cuts, which they see as a far more potent
way of stimulating additional growth. Some liberals fear that
concentrating on debt reduction will divert attention from needed
investments in education, health care and poverty fighting, all
issues essential to the country's long-term prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging over the debate is an even bigger question: Are the
surpluses for real?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that nobody knows. It was only a few years ago
that the problem of budget deficits appeared intractable. Today's
fiscal optimism could prove equally transitory.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In announcing last week that the federal budget
surplus would be even more over the next 15 years _ a mind-boggling
$1 trillion _ than anticipated a few months ago, President Clinton
likened the government to a profligate consumer suddenly endowed
with the means and discipline to get out of debt and save for the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have now cut up Washington's credit card,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The actual American consumer, however, is not nearly so fiscally
virtuous. Minutes before Clinton said the Treasury might be able to
pay off the most important component of the national debt by 2015,
the Commerce Department released statistics showing that consumers
are headed in the other direction by spending more money than they
earn.
</P>
<P>
   The rate of personal savings turned negative last year; total
personal spending exceeded total after-tax income. Even as the
economy roared along, with jobs plentiful, wages rising and
inflation dormant, the savings rate declined to minus 1.2 percent
in May from minus 1.0 percent in April, the lowest since the
Depression.
</P>
<P>
   The public-private dichotomy may not be quite as stark as it
seems. Reaping huge government budget surpluses and wiping out the
national debt are just a hope at this point. Everything depends on
some sunny economic assumptions and revenue forecasts proving true
(the track record so far is not encouraging), and on Washington's
willingness to keep its appetite for tax cuts and new spending in
check (ditto).
</P>
<P>
   For their part, consumers are not quite so irresponsible as the
savings figures suggest. Although they are amassing debt, their
overall financial condition is not deteriorating, in large part
because the stock market boom and rising real estate values are
making them wealthier, at least on paper, even if their cash flow
is out of whack. The technical definition of savings includes bank
deposits and money invested in stocks, bonds or retirement savings
_ basically any after-tax income that a consumer does not spend.
But it does not include the capital gains on investments or
retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the contrast between promised government rectitude and
personal profligacy is jarring. And it was not the only discordant
note last week in economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, Clinton was making the case that one of the
great benefits of fiscal responsibility and debt reduction is lower
interest rates, since the government's reduced borrowing needs
leaves more capital available for businesses and consumers. On the
other, the Federal Reserve was raising rates to snuff out any
smoldering inflationary pressures generated by an economy that is
already red hot.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters even more complicated, the updated surplus
projections led Republicans to step up their push for a big tax
cut, which if enacted would stoke the economy even as the Fed is
trying to cool it off. (To add to the conundrum, Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan is one of the most fervent advocates in Washington of
lower taxes. Congress is likely to heed his call for another cut in
the capital gains tax, which would further fuel the turbo-charged
stock market, whose lofty valuations have been keeping Greenspan
awake at night for years.)
</P>
<P>
   There's good news, though. These apparent quandaries are the
interwoven byproducts of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Take the issue of personal savings and national debt. Arguably,
the government owes its opportunity to reduce the debt to
consumers, who as much as any other force have kept the economy and
the stock market steaming along and generating the flood of tax
revenues that has transformed deficit into surplus.
</P>
<P>
   To the degree that Americans are spendthrifts, it is because
they are confident about their own prospects. By opening their
wallets, they are creating jobs and fomenting competition that
leads to innovation and efficiency. And while their credit card
balances might be a bit steep, their household balance sheets are
quite healthy if assets like stocks and houses are taken into
account.
</P>
<P>
   The ratio of household liabilities to net worth actually
declined a bit between 1988 and 1998, to 16.7 percent from 16.9
percent, according to Federal Reserve figures assembled by Dresdner
Kleinwort Benson, an investment firm based in London. Rising debt
was more than offset by an increase in assets, especially stocks,
which last year accounted for a quarter of all household assets, up
from 10 percent a decade earlier.
</P>
<P>
   A negative savings rate is indeed a potential problem in the
long run, and it is only one of several imbalances that have
developed over the course of the long business expansion. Should
joblessness rise or the stock market head south, households might
quickly find themselves on the financial precipice. The same
dynamic could apply to the rapidly growing trade deficit, which so
far has been a symbol of the U.S. economy's strength and its
ability to absorb imports. A downturn could expose the deficit as a
weakness of serious proportions.
</P>
<P>
   But even looking narrowly at the savings rate, the news there is
not all bad.
</P>
<P>
   While personal savings is in free fall, the overall national
savings rate _ by far the more important economic indicator _ has
been rising. That is because the government has become a ``saver''
in economic terms in the past few years as budget deficits have
turned to surpluses and the Treasury has begun paying down the
national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the question of whether debt reduction is even the
best way to use the fiscal windfall. Mainstream economic thought
says yes. That position dovetails with the broad political
consensus that a crucial component to shoring up the ailing
entitlement programs, Social Security and Medicare, is getting the
government on sounder financial footing before the vast baby-boom
generation retires.
</P>
<P>
   But some conservatives say focusing on paying down the debt
dilutes support for tax cuts, which they see as a far more potent
way of stimulating additional growth. Some liberals fear that
concentrating on debt reduction will divert attention from needed
investments in education, health care and poverty fighting, all
issues essential to the country's long-term prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging over the debate is an even bigger question: Are the
surpluses for real?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that nobody knows. It was only a few years ago
that the problem of budget deficits appeared intractable. Today's
fiscal optimism could prove equally transitory.

WOMEN ON THE SOCCER FIELD: BRAZIL AVERTS ITS EYES

   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Across the United States right now, the
Women's World Cup of soccer is the sports event of high summer,
attracting stupendous crowds and frenzies of attention usually not
seen there for any kind of soccer, or any women's sport, let alone
both.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil met the United States on Sunday, July 4, in the
semifinals, but you would hardly have known it from the coverage
here in Rio.
</P>
<P>
   While Sissi and Katia (Brazilian soccer players use only one
name) are heading toward their confrontation with Mia Hamm and
Julie Foudy, Brazilian sports pages are focused almost entirely on
the prospects of their men's soccer team winning the Copa America
and the reasons why its coach, Wanderley Luxemburgo, left the top
goal scorers Romario and Edmundo off the squad.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer may be the king of sports here, but only the men's
version of the game seems to wear the crown. Not one of this year's
matches of the Brazilian national women's team has been televised
live, sponsors have shied away from any association with the team,
and hard-core fans who can recite the entire roster of the 1950
men's World Cup squad are hard-pressed to name even one of the
current World Cup women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, women's soccer still doesn't have a chance in
Brazil,'' Armando Nogueira, one of the country's leading sports
commentators, said when asked about the lack of interest here.
``The best woman player in Brazil will never be as popular as the
worst male player, and the main reason is that women have been
idolized as delicate objects of desire, incapable of playing a
physical-contact, body-to-body sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Renata Cordeiro, 29, is one of Brazil's few female
sportscasters, working for the SporTV cable channel as a soccer
specialist. She recalls that when she was a teen-ager, her best
friend asked that soccer be added to their school's physical
education curriculum. ``Absolutely not,'' was the answer that came
back. ``Soccer is not an appropriate activity for girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Such attitudes can be encountered all over Latin America, where
the passion for soccer is exceeded only by the deeply ingrained
machismo that governs the social roles of daily life. And
everything is accentuated in Brazil, which has won four men's World
Cups, more than any other country. Since the days of Pele, it has
prided itself on grooming the world's best players and playing the
most inventive and flashy version of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Brazil, soccer has a strong gender demarcation that makes
it a masculine domain par excellence,'' said Dr. Roberto da Matta,
a prominent anthropologist and sociologist. ``It is a sport that
contains all of the various elements that are traditionally used to
define masculinity: conflict, physical confrontation, guts,
dominance, control and endurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the verbs used in popular speech to describe possession
of the soccer ball are also the kinds of words used in the street
to describe sexual intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, all nouns in Portuguese have a gender, and the most
common word for ball, ``bola,'' has connotations as feminine as the
voluptuous roundness of the ball itself, which to many Brazilian
males evokes the breasts and buttocks of a woman's body.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see players out on the field kissing or caressing the ball
all the time,'' Ms. Cordeiro pointed out. ``There really is an
erotic component to this, and it is all tied up with the idea of
the man subduing the ball just as he would a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   The gender taboos extend not only to playing the national game
but also to seeing it performed. The stadium, with all its
ritualized public violence and swagger, both in the stands and on
the field, has traditionally been seen as off-limits to women. On
June 27, as part of a campaign to change that image, free tickets
were distributed to 8,000 women who were among the crowd of more
than 100,000 that attended the national championship between
Botafogo and Juventude at Maracana stadium here. But the notion of
actually going to a game remains anathema to many women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been to Maracana, and there is no way you could
ever get me to go there,'' said Leticia Carvalho de Almeida, a
34-year-old dental technician and mother of two daughters,
wrinkling her nose in disgust at the idea. ``Just to think of all
those stinking sweaty men shouting curse words, fighting and
pouring beer and urine all over each other makes me nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   In such an environment, the assumption at the popular level is
that any female athlete has somehow been masculinized and her
femininity compromised. The basketball star Hortensia got around
that problem by posing nude for Playboy; other basketball and
volleyball players, plagued by rumors that they are lesbians,
prefer to appear with boyfriends or husbands and children, their
faces made up and their hair coiffed, in glossy photo layouts for
gossip magazines like Caras or VIP.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that has held women's soccer back is that
there aren't any beautiful women yet who play the game,'' Nogueira
said. ``The volleyball authorities have made an investment in
sensuality that has really paid off for them, and women's soccer
needs to use those marketing methods. They should be trying to
increase the charm quotient instead of imitating men on the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   To the extent that Brazilians are interested in this Women's
World Cup at all, they seem more fascinated by the powerful U.S.
team, which has demonstrated the dominance and mastery they admire,
than by their own. As play was beginning, the weekly newsmagazine
Isto E ran a profile not of the home squad, but of ``the Yankee
girls'' and Ms. Hamm. Taking Brazil's flashiest male player as a
reference point, the article described Ms. Hamm as ``a kind of
Ronaldinho, but with better hips, a more agile game and an ability
to score lots of goals.''
</P>
<P>
   For female fans like Ms. Cordeiro, that focus has led to an
unexpected problem. As a Brazilian who knows and has interviewed
many of her country's top female players, she is naturally hoping
for a championship, or at least a good showing, by Brazil's team.
``It would really help the development of the game for women
here,'' she said. ``Brazilians expect their teams to win it all,
and if we could do that, it would build support and interest and
force the men to take the women's game seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   But as a woman, she is also ``thrilled by the way the Americans
play, the skill and nimbleness with which they dribble and pass the
ball and score goals,'' she conceded. ``They've proven once again
that women are capable of great things if they are just given some
sort of opening.''
</P>
<P>
   Da Matta, though, cautions that no matter who wins the cup,
Americans have no grounds to feel superior. ``The fundamental point
to remember is that all societies, not just Brazil, have these
blind spots, and that such cultural differences persist despite all
the talk of globalization,'' he said. ``For example, in your
country you have lots of women playing soccer, tennis, volleyball
and even baseball. But where are your female football players?''

A LAST, MODEST TRY AT HEALTH REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By ROBIN TONER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Midway through announcing his proposal to revamp
Medicare last week, President Clinton seemed to notice that there
were ghosts in the room.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled the first time he came face to face with the
suffering of older Americans forced to choose between medicine and
food _ during the rough, recessionary days of the 1992 presidential
campaign, when the plight of the uninsured and the under-insured
burst into the public's consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was almost seven years ago,'' Clinton said, somewhat
ruefully, ``but it still happens today.''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, Clinton's new proposal for Medicare, the giant
federal health program for the elderly and the disabled, seemed to
be something more than another ritualistic exercise in
policy-making by a waning administration.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed, instead, to be one last attempt to come to grips with
a nation's contradictory desires on health care, and an
acknowledgment of the hard lessons learned in the past seven years.
There were, indeed, a lot of ghosts in the room, from the
bright-eyed Clintonians who tried, and failed, to reconstruct the
American health care system in 1993, to the confident Republicans
who tried, and failed, to overhaul the Medicare system in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Among the ghosts in the room last week was President Lyndon B.
Johnson, the political godfather of Medicare, quoted by Clinton _
and perhaps invoked for his talismanic power.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle over health care, in retrospect, was one of the
defining political conflicts of the 1990s. And most of its tensions
were evident again last week as Clinton unveiled his plan to
fortify Medicare's finances, add prescription drugs to its benefits
and spur more competition for its beneficiaries among private
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Congress and the White House faced a debate over how
to hold down costs while still delivering high-quality care. Once
again, the subtext was how much faith to place in the corporate
sector and the power of the marketplace, and how much trust to
reserve for the government.
</P>
<P>
   And once again, politicians were asking how much Americans were
willing to spend to insure that the technological revolutions of
modern medicine _ like the newest, most expensive prescription
drugs _ are available and affordable to those who need them.
</P>
<P>
   In one forum or another, those issues have been debated since a
little-known Pennsylvania Democrat, Harris Wofford, put health care
reform on the political map by riding it to victory in a special
Senate election in 1991. For all the struggle over health care,
though, only the murkiest consensus has emerged. At the end of the
day, said Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a
health research group, ``there's a broad sense that nothing's easy
in health policy and there are no magic solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest Clinton plan is a sadder-but-wiser guess at what is
still feasible and politically palatable among the grand theories
and principles that have dominated health care thinking over the
past 10 years. It is perhaps most striking for what it doesn't do.
As Marilyn Moon, a health care analyst at the Urban Institute in
Washington, put it, the plan ``doesn't lock us into big-time
structural change before we really know where we want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton proposal seeks a mixed solution of managed care
(health maintenance organizations and other entities that try to
control costs and coordinate care) and traditional fee-for-service
medicine (in which patients have a free choice of doctors
reimbursed by the government).
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say their new plan would protect and
buttress traditional Medicare for anyone who chooses it while
creating new incentives for competition among private health care
plans for Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not radical restructuring, but it's not incremental
reform either,'' said Robert Reischauer, an economist at the
Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   It is, in a sense, another Clintonian compromise, this time
between the ardent defenders of traditional Medicare and the true
believers in the marketplace, who argue that the government has
never really given managed care plans a fair shot at competing for
Medicare business.
</P>
<P>
   But it also reflects a more realistic appraisal of ideas that
once looked so promising. In 1993, there was a lot more hubris:
When the administration first attempted to restructure the rest of
the health care system, many of its health planners saw managed
care and a well-organized marketplace as nothing short of wondrous
in their ability to control costs and improve quality.
</P>
<P>
   Today, after a private sector revolution that pushed most
working Americans into managed care with mixed results, a lot of
that euphoria is gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's hardly anybody left who really believes we're
on the dawn of offering dramatically better service to people at a
lower price,'' said Robert Blendon, an expert on public opinion and

A LAST, MODEST TRY AT HEALTH REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By ROBIN TONER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Midway through announcing his proposal to revamp
Medicare last week, President Clinton seemed to notice that there
were ghosts in the room.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled the first time he came face to face with the
suffering of older Americans forced to choose between medicine and
food _ during the rough, recessionary days of the 1992 presidential
campaign, when the plight of the uninsured and the under-insured
burst into the public's consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was almost seven years ago,'' Clinton said, somewhat
ruefully, ``but it still happens today.''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, Clinton's new proposal for Medicare, the giant
federal health program for the elderly and the disabled, seemed to
be something more than another ritualistic exercise in
policy-making by a waning administration.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed, instead, to be one last attempt to come to grips with
a nation's contradictory desires on health care, and an
acknowledgment of the hard lessons learned in the past seven years.
There were, indeed, a lot of ghosts in the room, from the
bright-eyed Clintonians who tried, and failed, to reconstruct the
American health care system in 1993, to the confident Republicans
who tried, and failed, to overhaul the Medicare system in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Among the ghosts in the room last week was President Lyndon B.
Johnson, the political godfather of Medicare, quoted by Clinton _
and perhaps invoked for his talismanic power.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle over health care, in retrospect, was one of the
defining political conflicts of the 1990s. And most of its tensions
were evident again last week as Clinton unveiled his plan to
fortify Medicare's finances, add prescription drugs to its benefits
and spur more competition for its beneficiaries among private
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Congress and the White House faced a debate over how
to hold down costs while still delivering high-quality care. Once
again, the subtext was how much faith to place in the corporate
sector and the power of the marketplace, and how much trust to
reserve for the government.
</P>
<P>
   And once again, politicians were asking how much Americans were
willing to spend to insure that the technological revolutions of
modern medicine _ like the newest, most expensive prescription
drugs _ are available and affordable to those who need them.
</P>
<P>
   In one forum or another, those issues have been debated since a
little-known Pennsylvania Democrat, Harris Wofford, put health care
reform on the political map by riding it to victory in a special
Senate election in 1991. For all the struggle over health care,
though, only the murkiest consensus has emerged. At the end of the
day, said Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a
health research group, ``there's a broad sense that nothing's easy
in health policy and there are no magic solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest Clinton plan is a sadder-but-wiser guess at what is
still feasible and politically palatable among the grand theories
and principles that have dominated health care thinking over the
past 10 years. It is perhaps most striking for what it doesn't do.
As Marilyn Moon, a health care analyst at the Urban Institute in
Washington, put it, the plan ``doesn't lock us into big-time
structural change before we really know where we want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton proposal seeks a mixed solution of managed care
(health maintenance organizations and other entities that try to
control costs and coordinate care) and traditional fee-for-service
medicine (in which patients have a free choice of doctors
reimbursed by the government).
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say their new plan would protect and
buttress traditional Medicare for anyone who chooses it while
creating new incentives for competition among private health care
plans for Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not radical restructuring, but it's not incremental
reform either,'' said Robert Reischauer, an economist at the
Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   It is, in a sense, another Clintonian compromise, this time
between the ardent defenders of traditional Medicare and the true
believers in the marketplace, who argue that the government has
never really given managed care plans a fair shot at competing for
Medicare business.
</P>
<P>
   But it also reflects a more realistic appraisal of ideas that
once looked so promising. In 1993, there was a lot more hubris:
When the administration first attempted to restructure the rest of
the health care system, many of its health planners saw managed
care and a well-organized marketplace as nothing short of wondrous
in their ability to control costs and improve quality.
</P>
<P>
   Today, after a private sector revolution that pushed most
working Americans into managed care with mixed results, a lot of
that euphoria is gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's hardly anybody left who really believes we're
on the dawn of offering dramatically better service to people at a
lower price,'' said Robert Blendon, an expert on public opinion and
health at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, this month the Senate will begin debate on legislation
to create a ``patients' bill of rights'' to protect consumers in
the new world of managed care.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Medicare's experience with managed care in the past
few years has hardly been an unalloyed success. Last week, HMOs
announced further pullbacks from the Medicare market as well as
benefit cuts and premium hikes, claiming the government has been
underpaying them.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of making Medicare more like a private health care
market say such difficulties are a result of too much government
regulation. But others say Medicare needs to move cautiously, given
the difficulties of shifting an older, medically vulnerable
population into the private marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton plan also tries to deal with a longstanding question
of access to health care: It proposes prescription drug coverage in
Medicare, at a time when new pharmaceuticals offer extraordinary
promise to older Americans but confront them with extraordinary
expense. This proposal, too, reflects the sadder-but-wiser approach
to health policy; most expansions of benefits or coverage since the
failure of the Clinton effort in 1993-94 have been discrete,
focused efforts like this, from protections for people changing
jobs in 1996 to coverage for uninsured children in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It is noteworthy, perhaps, that even when the government is
awash in surpluses, there is very little serious discussion in
Washington these days about reducing the vulnerability of the 43
million uninsured Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we ever get closer to universal coverage, it'll be through
a hundred incremental programs, because of the legacy of
extraordinary cynicism and distrust of government,'' Blendon
predicts.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the health care wars, of course, Clinton
promised to give every American a health security card and the
benefits to go with it. The collapse of his plan was seen as such a
repudiation of government that few politicians dare broach the
subject of universal coverage these days.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe that it will take a crisis _ perhaps a
major economic downturn and an even greater increase in the numbers
of uninsured _ before that issue rises to the top of the agenda
again.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton may be long gone by that time; the Medicare proposal may
be his last on health care. It is almost certainly less than what
he thought he would accomplish when health care first arose in the
1992 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But no one considers passage of his plan, or some equivalent, to
be a sure thing.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Every Tuesday and Thursday morning at 8, Dr.
Domenica Vacca, an obstetrician-gynecologist who quit practicing
medicine two years ago when her son was born, arrives for work at a
white-shingled three-story building in Owings, Md. For the next
eight hours, she sits in front of a computer and holds private
electronic conversations with people seeking her advice on
everything from herpes to menopause.
</P>
<P>
   In her part-time job with Ask the Doc, a service offered free by
AmericasDoctor.com, Dr. Vacca traverses delicate legal territory. A
lengthy on-screen disclaimer informs her questioners that the
company's Internet doctors _ it employs more than 100 _ ``will not
engage in any conduct that involves the practice of medicine.''
They will not diagnose illness, prescribe medication, keep a
medical record of the conversation or even reveal their identities.
But they do provide something the callers' own doctors often can't
give: peace of mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a lot of questions on menstrual irregularity,
pregnancy,'' Dr. Vacca says. ``A lot of questions on sexually
transmitted diseases, women coming on saying I have this pain or
that discharge, what could it be? And they will actually say, `I
can't get through to my doctor.' ''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when managed care has put greater distance between
doctors and their patients, the Internet is filling the gaps.
According to Scott Reents, an analyst with Cyber Dialogue, a New
York company that tracks Internet commerce, last year an estimated
22 million Americans went online for medical information, mostly
about specific diseases and drugs. That number is projected to jump
to 33 million by next year.
</P>
<P>
   All that growth translates into what Reents called ``a
free-for-all'' on the World Wide Web, where thousands of sites are
offering some type of health information. Investment money is
pouring in; Dr. C. Everett Koop, a U.S. surgeon general in the
1980s, became a 1999 Internet millionaire when his Web site,
DrKoop.com, went public. Healtheon, the medical records giant, has
snapped up WebMd, a small Internet health information company, in a
deal valued at more than $8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Even Dr. George Lundberg, who as the editor of the Journal of
the American Medical Association, once cautioned that ``science and
snake oil may not always look all that different on the Net,'' has
gone electronic. After being dismissed from the journal in January,
he became editor in chief of Medscape.com, an information site for
doctors. Medscape will launch a consumer site this month, which
Lundberg said would ``set the standard'' for Internet health
information.
</P>
<P>
   With so much money at stake, and so many patients hungry for
information, experts say it was inevitable that doctors would begin
not only offering advice over the Internet but using the Web to
practice medicine. And they have, in ways that make many medical
experts, and even some Internet health entrepreneurs, a little
queasy.
</P>
<P>
   Some have set up Web sites for the sole purpose of prescribing
and selling hot-ticket prescription drugs like Viagra to patients
they have not met _ a practice that has drawn the attention of
state and federal regulators, who regard it as unethical, though
not illegal. The American Medical Association says doctors who
prescribe drugs to people they have never physically examined
should face disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am ashamed to call them a part of my profession,'' said Dr.
Nancy Dickey, a former president of the association.
</P>
<P>
   Others are finding novel ways to diagnose and treat over the
Net. Dr. Daniel Carlin, a Massachusetts emergency medicine
specialist, founded WorldClinic to treat people living and
traveling abroad. Carlin, who has worked as a volunteer in Afghan
refugee camps, outfits his patients with kits that include
prescription medication. He keeps their medical records on file,
and patients who need him quickly can send an electronic message
and his beeper will go off. Soon, Carlin said, his Web site will
offer links to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and
other reliable sources of information. Last year, he drew
international attention when, via e-mail, he helped save the arm of
a Russian sailor who had been injured in a yacht race 1,000 miles
off the coast of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Cyberdocs.com practices medicine at home. For a fee of $50 to
$100, the Web site provides board-certified specialists who engage
in private electronic chat sessions, which the company calls
``virtual house calls,'' to treat minor illnesses. The doctors can
prescribe any drugs except controlled substances, including
narcotics. Dr. Tom Caffrey, who founded the company in 1996, five
years after graduating from medical school, said he has diagnosed a
case of shingles, sent someone to the emergency room for heart
disease and refilled blood pressure medication _ all online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say you're at work, you're feeling sick,'' said Caffrey. ``Do
you have four hours to go to the emergency room? Can you get an
appointment with your doctor who is jerking you around? Here's a
way for patients and doctors to talk again.''
</P>
<P>
   Caffrey says he wants Cyberdocs to lay the groundwork for the
next technological revolution, when video conferencing becomes
commonplace. The doctors at Cyberdocs, which is insured for
malpractice, work only within their specialties, and only on
patients who live in states the doctors are licensed in. ``We're
trying to do real medicine,'' Caffrey said, ``under the limitations
of the present technology.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the company is crossing the line. Why have
virtual visits, they ask, when there are plenty of American doctors
available? ``It is difficult for me to imagine that any physician
is doing this for other than monetary return,'' said Dr. David
Rothman, a medical historian at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   And why, some critics ask, would anyone attempt to diagnose a
patient's illness without a physical exam or even the simplest
tests, like blood pressure monitoring?
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole contractual relationship between a doctor and a
patient is that you actually see, touch, feel, smell a patient to
get as much data as you can to be accurate in your diagnosis and
treatment,'' said Dr. Bruce Dan, medical director of Medcast, a
private online service for doctors. The telephone is more
productive than an online chat, he says. ``You can hear the tenor
of the patient,'' Dan said.
</P>
<P>
   There are no professional standards for doctors working on the
Web, and experts say even those patients who sign on just looking
for a free opinion should be cautious. ``We don't know who's out
there giving the advice,'' said Dr. Arthur Caplan, director of the
Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania. ``You may
be getting advice on your allergies from a pathologist. On your
psychological problems from a gastroenterologist.''
</P>
<P>
   Someday, Caplan predicted, these problems will be erased by
technology. ``We will have certification and standards for doctors,
link-ups to televised images and readouts from microchips that may
be in your body,'' he said. ``I think that world will come, but it
ain't here by a long shot.''

   LAW FOR THE SAFEGUARD OF GERMAN BLOOD OF GERMAN HONOR
</P>
<P>
   Certain in the knowledge that the purity of the German blood is
the fundamental necessity for the continuation of the German

forced labor.

<P>
   PATTON'S STATEMENT
</P>
<P>
   When he turned the Nuremberg Laws over to the Huntington Library
in 1945, Patton included this explanatory statement:
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Third Army entered the city of Nuremberg there was
quite a fight going on and the city was burning. Some troops of the
90th Infantry Division fighting through the town came to a stairway
which they went down with grenades, in case there were any Germans.
There were no Germans. They found a vault, not open, and persuaded
a German to open it for them. In it they found this thing. That was
all that was in the vault.
</P>
<P>
   These soldiers of the 90th Division were very fond of me and I
was very fond of them. They thought they would like to do something
for me, so they sent for me, and we had a great public
presentation. The former commanding general of the 90th Division,
now commander of the Third Corps, General (J.A.) Van Fleet _ he
actually made the presentation to me. So it is my property. They
have given me a lot of other things but this is the important one.
This (document) was taken the day we captured Nuremberg, about the
14th of March. We captured so many towns I have forgotten just
which day. The presentation must have been about the 27th of May.''
</P>
<P>
   And Patton offered this addendum regarding the rare volume of
``Mein Kampf.'' Here he overstates the importance of Hitler's
publisher, Max Amann, within the Third Reich, while implying with
some bluster that he faced the gallows:
</P>
<P>
   ``That book was alleged by a talkative German to be one of a
limited edition of the unexpurgated text. There were alleged to
have been 100 copies. It was published by a man named Emman (sic).
He is the No. 3 bad man in Germany. I have him in jail now. We'll
stretch him pretty quick!''

TURKS AND KURDS: THE CONFLICT THAT SEEMS TO HAVE NO EXIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)

 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ To outsiders, the solution to Turkey's long
conflict with Kurdish insurgents may seem easy and obvious. Over
the last few weeks, the rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan has made it as
clear as the air that envelops the rugged mountains in the war
zone. Let us Kurds use our language freely, let us have a
television station, and acknowledge our ethnic identity, he said at
his recently concluded treason trial. Then we will stop waging a
war that has cost Turkey more than $100 billion and the lives of
more than 30,000 people over 15 years, in the process tearing the
country apart and blackening its name abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally it is difficult for Turks or their leaders to imagine
negotiating with Ocalan or others who have touched off such
destruction. But the world has become accustomed to watching
governments grudgingly deal with Palestinian, Irish and Basque
groups that engaged in horrific terrorism. In Britain, the
murderers of several police officers and a bomber who nearly
succeeded in assassinating Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher were
recently freed from prison as a painful gesture of good will aimed
at resolving the conflict in Northern Ireland. Spain has granted
its Basque region almost complete autonomy, and as a result the
assassinations that wracked the region for years have all but
ceased. Why not a similar formula in Turkey?
</P>
<P>
   The capture of Ocalan, and his subsequent trial and death
sentence pronounced last week, present Turkey with its best chance
in years to test a new approach to Kurdish nationalism. Military
commanders, who hold the final word in such matters, will probably
have many months to reflect on the matter while Ocalan's appeals
proceed through Turkish and European courts. But choosing the path
of conciliation would represent a radical departure for leaders
who, with broad popular support, have for years considered force
the only appropriate response to what they call terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for Turkey's implacable resistance to Kurdish
demands lies in history. For 200 years before the the Turkish
Republic was founded in 1923, the Ottoman Empire had been steadily
shrinking. The Republic was formed after a military force led by
Mustafa Kemal Ataturk defeated Greeks and their Western allies who
were trying to slice up even the Anatolian mainland. Fear of losing
more territory consumes many Turks, and when they hear Kurds
demanding autonomy or cultural rights, they sense the start of
secession.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey has come a long way from the days when it did not even
acknowledge the existence of Kurds, calling them ``mountain Turks''
and, in 1981, sentencing a former member of parliament to a year in
prison for declaring: ``There are Kurds in Turkey. I am a Kurd.''
But many people here cannot bring themselves to view Kurds, who
constitute at least 15 percent of the population, as a minority.
They still use the definition of a minority as it was used in the
Ottoman Empire. In those days, minorities were given broad powers
of self-government, but only non-Muslim groups qualified. Since
most Kurds are Muslims, the idea that they could be considered a
minority seems absurd to many Turks. These Turks also fear that
conceding special status to the Kurds could lead to claims by other
groups in Turkey, which is far more ethnically diverse than some
admit.
</P>
<P>
   In the 15 years since the Kurdish war began, emotion has taken
over much of Turkey's reaction to it. Thousands of grief-stricken
parents have buried their sons at funerals that afflict entire
towns. The press is forbidden to question the conduct of the war or
the value of fighting it, and instead whips up popular passion. No
coverage may be given to the grief felt by mothers of slain Kurdish
fighters, nor can writers portray the conflict as Kurdish militants
see it. Ordinary Turks have no idea what is actually happening in
southeastern provinces where the war is being fought. Knowing how
Turkish police and soldiers operate, they realize that things are
not pretty there. Most believe, however, that there is no other
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being tough and not giving in is a very important value in
this part of the world,'' said a foreign military officer who
closely follows the Kurdish conflict. ``If you negotiate or
compromise, it's seen as a sign of weakness. That's one of the main
reasons why this thing is such a tough nut to crack.''
</P>
<P>
   The Turkish ruling elite considers rebellion by Kurds profoundly
illegitimate because in Turkey, Kurds are granted every individual
right. Once a Kurd accepts that he or she is above all Turkish,
anything is possible. Many Kurds, especially those living in
Istanbul and other cities far from the war zone, have accepted this
offer and been successfully assimilated. Some have risen to the
highest ranks of politics, business and entertainment. But others
refuse society's offer. They acknowledge that Turkey gives them
individual rights, but they also want something more: group rights.
They want the right to their Kurdishness, meaning the right to
speak their language without restriction and to maintain a distinct
cultural identity. That is something the state steadfastly refuses
to concede.
</P>
<P>
   In this climate, it is inconceivable that Turkey will grant
Kurdish provinces any form of autonomy or self-rule. But this is a
highly centralized country, and the southeast is not the only
region clamoring for more power. Some who have studied the Kurdish
problem suggest that one way of resolving it would be to grant
every part of the country more local authority, broadening
democracy for all citizens. Combined with a serious economic
development package for the Kurdish region, much of which is mired
in poverty, such a ``devolution'' package might work wonders.
</P>
<P>
   With Turkey's collective mind so frozen in traditional
approaches to Kurdish nationalism, what can the outside world do to
encourage new departures? Remarkably little, it seems. It is part
of Turks' psychology to believe that the world is constantly
plotting against their nation. Advice from abroad is often
considered naive or ill-intentioned. But that does not rule out
some delicate encouragement from the United States, which is
Turkey's closest ally and supplies much of its weaponry, and from
Europe, whose club Turkey would love to join.
</P>
<P>
   Because military commanders maintain the right of veto over
Kurdish policy, and because most Turks trust their judgment, they
alone can decide on a change of course. That is not such a
discouraging reality, since many senior commanders are
well-educated, worldly and sophisticated. But it seems extremely
unlikely that they could lead the country toward a new Kurdish
policy unless one of two things happens. The military leaders could
decide among themselves that the time is ripe, or they could find
themselves forced to do so by a civilian leader with broad popular
support. The last civilian with such power was President Turgut
Ozal, who died in 1993, and in the splintered political climate of
today's Turkey, no other such figure is on the horizon.

They still use the definition of a minority as it was used in the
Ottoman Empire. In those days, minorities were given broad powers
of self-government, but only non-Muslim groups qualified. Since
most Kurds are Muslims, the idea that they could be considered a
minority seems absurd to many Turks. These Turks also fear that
conceding special status to the Kurds could lead to claims by other
groups in Turkey, which is far more ethnically diverse than some
admit.
</P>
<P>
   In the 15 years since the Kurdish war began, emotion has taken
over much of Turkey's reaction to it. Thousands of grief-stricken
parents have buried their sons at funerals that afflict entire
towns. The press is forbidden to question the conduct of the war or
the value of fighting it, and instead whips up popular passion. No
coverage may be given to the grief felt by mothers of slain Kurdish
fighters, nor can writers portray the conflict as Kurdish militants
see it. Ordinary Turks have no idea what is actually happening in
southeastern provinces where the war is being fought. Knowing how
Turkish police and soldiers operate, they realize that things are
not pretty there. Most believe, however, that there is no other
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being tough and not giving in is a very important value in
this part of the world,'' said a foreign military officer who
closely follows the Kurdish conflict. ``If you negotiate or
compromise, it's seen as a sign of weakness. That's one of the main
reasons why this thing is such a tough nut to crack.''
</P>
<P>
   The Turkish ruling elite considers rebellion by Kurds profoundly
illegitimate because in Turkey, Kurds are granted every individual
right. Once a Kurd accepts that he or she is above all Turkish,
anything is possible. Many Kurds, especially those living in
Istanbul and other cities far from the war zone, have accepted this
offer and been successfully assimilated. Some have risen to the
highest ranks of politics, business and entertainment. But others
refuse society's offer. They acknowledge that Turkey gives them
individual rights, but they also want something more: group rights.
They want the right to their Kurdishness, meaning the right to
speak their language without restriction and to maintain a distinct
cultural identity. That is something the state steadfastly refuses
to concede.
</P>
<P>
   In this climate, it is inconceivable that Turkey will grant
Kurdish provinces any form of autonomy or self-rule. But this is a
highly centralized country, and the southeast is not the only
region clamoring for more power. Some who have studied the Kurdish
problem suggest that one way of resolving it would be to grant
every part of the country more local authority, broadening
democracy for all citizens. Combined with a serious economic
development package for the Kurdish region, much of which is mired
in poverty, such a ``devolution'' package might work wonders.
</P>
<P>
   With Turkey's collective mind so frozen in traditional
approaches to Kurdish nationalism, what can the outside world do to
encourage new departures? Remarkably little, it seems. It is part
of Turks' psychology to believe that the world is constantly
plotting against their nation. Advice from abroad is often
considered naive or ill-intentioned. But that does not rule out
some delicate encouragement from the United States, which is
Turkey's closest ally and supplies much of its weaponry, and from
Europe, whose club Turkey would love to join.
</P>
<P>
   Because military commanders maintain the right of veto over
Kurdish policy, and because most Turks trust their judgment, they
alone can decide on a change of course. That is not such a
discouraging reality, since many senior commanders are
well-educated, worldly and sophisticated. But it seems extremely
unlikely that they could lead the country toward a new Kurdish
policy unless one of two things happens. The military leaders could
decide among themselves that the time is ripe, or they could find
themselves forced to do so by a civilian leader with broad popular
support. The last civilian with such power was President Turgut
Ozal, who died in 1993, and in the splintered political climate of
today's Turkey, no other such figure is on the horizon.

   A few months ago, Seattle Mariners executive Dave Aust was
wracking his brains for a fitting send-off for the Kingdome, the
Mariners' ballpark since 1977, which closed Sunday, June 27.
</P>
<P>
   He had an explosive notion: Sell thousands of detonating
plungers to Mariners fans for a couple of bucks apiece, and let
them take part in blowing the place up when it is scheduled to be
leveled with dynamite next March. ``A lot of people would pay money
to do that,'' Aust said. ``Everyone wants to see it blown up.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, some ballparks today don't evoke the same wistful
nostalgia that others did a generation ago. Mention the demolition
of Ebbets Field in 1960 and many Brooklynites, still drying their
eyes over Valentino, begin to tear up again. But with five new
major league stadiums set to sprout in the next 12 months,
sentimentality has been put on waivers.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? The Kingdome, an indoor park once known as the Tomb
for all its gray, empty concrete, has been a blight on the baseball
landscape for a generation. And the four stadiums still limping
through their final season _ Tiger Stadium in Detroit, the Houston
Astrodome, County Stadium in Milwaukee and 3Com (formerly
Candlestick) Park in San Francisco _ won't inspire many weepy
eulogies either.
</P>
<P>
   In its early years, the inside of the Kingdome roof camouflaged
pop flies so well that they often fell among several helpless
fielders. One sure-fire Dave Kingman home run was caught for an out
after it hit a support wire above the field. And in 1994, four
15-pound tiles plummeted from the ceiling a half-hour before game
time, one of them landing 50 feet from the Baltimore Orioles iron
man Cal Ripken Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no current ballpark has earned more abuse than San
Francisco's, which by virtue of sitting on the tip of Candlestick
Point in the Bay rivals the climate of arctic tundra. Salty wind
gusts regularly separate players from their caps; during the 1961
All-Star Game, Stu Miller of the hometown Giants was blown clear
off the pitcher's mound. Since 1983, the club has awarded a ``Croix
de Candlestick'' pin to all fans who weather a frigid, extra-inning
affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great going there in July and freezing your butt off,''
said New York Yankees manager Joe Torre, who played in Candlestick
throughout his 1960-77 playing career. ``Willie Mays would hit a
lot of balls to left field and, man, they wouldn't go anywhere,''
he recalled. ``I was catching one day, and Felipe Alou hit a ball
that went out of the park _ and came back.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Stadium, tied with Boston's Fenway Park as the oldest park
in the majors, opened on April 20, 1912 _ five days after the
Titanic sank. More fans would have seen Ty Cobb, Hank Greenberg, Al
Kaline and other Tigers legends play there if the view of thousands
hadn't been obstructed by jutting roofs and steel pillars. Players
complain that the dugouts are so deep that when they sit down, they
can't see the outfielders. Then there was the sign long posted
outside a locker room: ``Visitors Clubhouse _ No Visitors.''
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Astrodome has had more than human visitors in its 35
seasons. Once known as the Eighth Wonder of the World, the stadium
that gave America artificial grass now finds cats and rats
scurrying across it. The rodents are so big that Giants manager
Dusty Baker said, ``I've heard stories of cats running from rats.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you come when the team's out of town,'' said one Astros
employee, ``the cats are hanging around first base and the
pitcher's mound. During a stadium tour, the cats were looking at us
like, `What are you doing, invading our home?'''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to improve the fans' experience at County Stadium in
Milwaukee have fallen a little flat. The mascot Bernie the Brewer,
decked in lederhosen, slides down into a huge beer stein when a
Milwaukee player hits a home run, but the team's offense can be so
weak he gets as scarce as the Maytag repair man.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the gaggles of gulls from Lake Michigan that
feast on tailgaters' garbage in the parking lot. Roars from a
nearby Harley-Davidson convention in 1993 scared the birds into the
ballpark, where they congregated on the outfield grass during
games. A pooch named Gus the Wonderdog was brought in to chase them
away, but Gus was unconditionally released after leaving some
souvenirs of his own.
</P>
<P>
   These five parks will be replaced by fan-friendly
techno-stadiums that should make fans forget all about their
predecessors. Retractable domes on the new Safeco Field in Seattle,
the Ballpark at Union Station in Houston and Miller Park in
Milwaukee will tip their caps when the weather's nice. At Pacific
Bell Park in San Francisco, fans can marvel at long home runs to
right field plunking into the China Basin Channel. Comerica Park in
Detroit will feature the world's largest scoreboard, not to mention
a barbecue-and-beer garden.
</P>
<P>
   And don't worry, fans. Like every other new baseball stadium
these days, the new parks will be packed with so many interactive
doodads for the kids that they couldn't possibly be distracted by
some ballgame.

   New York Pauses for a Tall Tale
</P>
<P>
   On the last leg of what still seems a remarkable journey, Edwin
Daniel Sabillon charmed the city. The 13-year-old Honduran boy told
a heart-rending, though made-up, tale to strangers he met in Miami,
who bought him a bus ticket to New York City. He arrived Sunday,
June 27, and after a few hours of sightseeing, he was picked up by
a taxi driver who was captivated by his smile and touched by his
story. The driver alerted the police, the police alerted the news
media, which naturally alerted the mayor, and Edwin was a
sensation.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone believed, perhaps because they wanted to, his tale of
losing his mother to a mudslide and of making his way alone across
3,200 miles and three countries in search of his father in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that the essentials of Edwin's narrative are not
true. His mother is alive, although she gave him over to his
paternal grandmother when he was an infant. His father is dead, but
he was far away in the United States for most of Edwin's life. His
relatives say he ran away some months ago from his grandmother's
house in Honduras and showed up one day in Hialeah, Fla., where an
aunt lives. How he got there is still a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   His future now is uncertain, although perhaps no more uncertain
than it was before he embarked on his grand adventure. Some in New
York seemed as quick to cast him as a villain as they had been to
embrace him as a hero, leaving no room for him to be just a
troubled young boy. Others said they still wanted to adopt him. He
is, for the moment, a ward of the city, thanks to no less a patron
than Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who was tickled by Edwin's spunkiness.
Edwin, after all, did what many have done before him: He came to
America to reinvent himself.

   Vodka and Water, a Deadly Mix
</P>
<P>
   Vodka is Russian for ``little water,'' a playful diminutive
ludicrously out of place given what it does to those who drink it
before taking a swim. In Moscow alone, 144 swimmers drowned between
May 1 and June 21, and on a particularly brutal weekend in
mid-June, as many as 16 died each day _ three more than the daily
average for the entire United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Moscow coroner's office, which examined June's 89 deaths at
a reporter's request, concluded that 94 percent of the swimmers
were drunk when they drowned. All but 10 were men, usually between
the ages of 20 and 40. Indeed, two in every 10,000 men in that age
group drowned in 1997, a pace that beats even the infamous homicide
rate in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Shocking as it is, the drowning rate only hints at a broader
connection between alcohol and accidents, especially among men.
From falls to fires to poisonings, Russia has one of the highest
accidental death rates on Earth, and vodka is usually a factor.
More shocking, at least to health experts, is the nation's blase
attitude toward the carnage, which is almost unnoticed among
ordinary Russians.
</P>
<P>
   It's part of Russia's larger problem of weak public health
measures, said Martin McKee, an expert on Russian mortality trends
at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
Alcohol-related accidents are almost entirely preventable, but
preventive medicine is in its infancy in Russia _ and civic
movements like anti-drunk-driving campaigns are unheard of.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it could be worse _ and was. Vodka consumption has been
slowly falling since drinking peaked in 1994. That year, the
drowning rate among men was 30 percent higher than was reflected in
the 1997 statistics.

   Fed Raises Interest Rates Just a Tad, Just in Case
</P>
<P>
   There is little evidence of inflation. But there is enough fear
of it that the Federal Reserve raised interest rates a notch, to
make sure the economy does not get derailed by a spiral of rising
wages and prices.
</P>
<P>
   The quarter point increase in the Fed's benchmark rate, to 5
percent, was enough to bring protests from business, labor and
other critics of tight monetary policy. But the Fed sugarcoated its
decision by suggesting it might not have to raise rates again this
summer.

   Clinton Eases Restrictions On Computer Exports
</P>
<P>
   A month ago it seemed as if reports of Chinese spies and
technology leaks would result in a crackdown on high-technology
exports to China. Wrong. Under pressure from Silicon Valley,
President Clinton announced that he would make it far easier to
ship high-performance personal computers and microprocessors to
China, Russia and other nations. In an era when supercomputer
speeds can be reached on a $2,000 laptop, the president concluded,
it makes sense to control only the most rarified technology. The
Republicans, including Texas Gov. George W. Bush, seemed to agree.
The Silicon Valley, by the way, is a wellspring of campaign money.

   Fewer Gay Men in New York Are Contracting AIDS

<P>
   The largest survey of the sexual health of gay men in New York
City has found a significant reduction in their levels of risky
sexual behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Greater use of condoms and safer sex helped explain a sharp drop
in the number of gay men now infected with the AIDS virus (about
one in seven from about one in three in 1985), said officials of
the New York City Health Department who conducted the survey last
year in a partnership with the Gay Men's Health Crisis.

   A Long-Ago Slight And a Murdered Child
</P>
<P>
   It's a staggeringly upside-down tale. By all accounts, Ronald
Shanabarger of Franklin, Ind., married in anger, conceived a child
in anger and looked on in anger as his son was born. As
quick-flaring angers go, his was ancient: Before he married, his
wife-to-be had refused to cut short her vacation cruise when his
father died, and he silently vowed revenge.
</P>
<P>
   The anger burned on, and when his son was 7 months old, he
suffocated him in his crib. Then, haunted by the image of the
child's face, he confessed.

oppose a Republican bill to limit lawsuits arising from Year 2000
computer failures. Detrimental to consumers, he said, and a
precedent for restraints on litigation. Most Democrats obliged,
despite pressure from the computer industry and other businesses
constituents. After Republicans made some small concessions, the
president changed his mind. The Senate and House quickly approved
the agreement, and Clinton promised to sign it.

   An Official Welcome Back For the Resurgent Bald Eagle
</P>
<P>
   The bald eagle, the symbol of American freedom, was officially
removed from the list of animals threatened with extinction. At a
White House ceremony, President Clinton credited efforts under the
Endangered Species Act for the bird's return.
</P>
<P>
   Some 500,000 bald eagles soared in American skies 200 years ago,
but by 1963, only 417 breeding pairs remained in the continental
United States. Hunting and pesticides that weakened eggshells were
among the causes of their decline. The eagles were put on the
endangered species list in 1967, and upgraded to threatened four
years ago, following years of efforts to improve their habitats and
reintroduce eaglets to the wild.

   Mitral Valve Problems Are Not So Serious After All
</P>
<P>
   As many as 28 million Americans who were told they are in danger
of stroke, heart failure and other problems because of mitral-valve
prolapse probably do not have to worry. A new study showed that
about 2.4 percent of the population _ not the 5 percent to 15
percent previously estimated _ have the condition, an abnormally
long, floppy valve that can cause blood leakage in the heart. And
in those who do have it, it was found no more likely to cause the
feared complications than those who do not.

   Independent Counsel Law Dies, and Mourners Are Few

   With little fanfare and no mourning, the independent counsel law
died after 21 years during which prosecutors appointed under the

</P>
<P>
   By the end, the statute, first enacted as an important
post-Watergate reform, was widely perceived as an abusive legal
bludgeon that had failed in its purpose of separating politics from
law in investigations of administration officials. Kenneth Starr's
wide-ranging investigation of the Clintons helped create that
perception.

   Fed Raises Interest Rates Just a Tad, Just in Case
</P>
<P>
   There is little evidence of inflation. But there is enough fear
of it that the Federal Reserve raised interest rates a notch, to
make sure the economy does not get derailed by a spiral of rising
wages and prices.
</P>
<P>
   The quarter point increase in the Fed's benchmark rate, to 5
percent, was enough to bring protests from business, labor and
other critics of tight monetary policy. But the Fed sugarcoated its
decision by suggesting it might not have to raise rates again this
summer.

   Clinton Eases Restrictions On Computer Exports
</P>
<P>
   A month ago it seemed as if reports of Chinese spies and
technology leaks would result in a crackdown on high-technology
exports to China. Wrong. Under pressure from Silicon Valley,
President Clinton announced that he would make it far easier to
ship high-performance personal computers and microprocessors to
China, Russia and other nations. In an era when supercomputer
speeds can be reached on a $2,000 laptop, the president concluded,
it makes sense to control only the most rarified technology. The
Republicans, including Texas Gov. George W. Bush, seemed to agree.
The Silicon Valley, by the way, is a wellspring of campaign money.

   Fewer Gay Men in New York Are Contracting AIDS
</P>
<P>
   The largest survey of the sexual health of gay men in New York
City has found a significant reduction in their levels of risky
sexual behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Greater use of condoms and safer sex helped explain a sharp drop
in the number of gay men now infected with the AIDS virus (about
one in seven from about one in three in 1985), said officials of
the New York City Health Department who conducted the survey last
year in a partnership with the Gay Men's Health Crisis.

   A Long-Ago Slight And a Murdered Child
</P>
<P>
   It's a staggeringly upside-down tale. By all accounts, Ronald
Shanabarger of Franklin, Ind., married in anger, conceived a child
in anger and looked on in anger as his son was born. As
quick-flaring angers go, his was ancient: Before he married, his
wife-to-be had refused to cut short her vacation cruise when his
father died, and he silently vowed revenge.
</P>
<P>
   The anger burned on, and when his son was 7 months old, he
suffocated him in his crib. Then, haunted by the image of the
child's face, he confessed.

TALK MONEY WITH AGING PARENTS BEFORE DISASTER STRIKES
</HEADLINE>
  Includes color photo of a man pondering a pile of medical bills 
 By Martha Nolan McKenzie 
 c.1999 New York Times Regional Newspapers 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frank Kimbrell watched his mother's health gradually fade. First
she suffered a series of strokes. Next came heart surgery, and then
Tressie Lee Potter, who is now 73, was diagnosed with Alzheimer's.
Still, a year ago when Kimbrell had to move her in with him and
take over her affairs, he was totally unprepared.
</P>
<P>
   Kimbrell, a 58-year-old carpenter for a construction company in
Spartanburg, S.C., spent seven frustrating months locating the
financial documents that were scattered throughout his mother's
small ranch-style house. He found her checkbook underneath a pile
of videotapes, overdue bills behind the television set and her will
in the pocket of her Sunday coat. He has yet to locate the title to
her car or her insurance policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't know anything about her financial situation, and it
was real tough finding anything out, since I didn't have power of
attorney,'' said Kimbrell.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 ''Fiscal Fitness'' survey by Phoenix Home Life Mutual
Insurance Company in Hartford, Conn., found a third of respondents
with living parents had little or no knowledge of their parents'
financial situation, and 42 percent had not discussed financial
issues with their aging parents.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many parents would sooner show their children their
gallbladder surgery scars than show them their checkbook,'' said
Charles Alkire, a certified financial planner in Sarasota, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   But not exchanging the information can lead to an outcome the
parents never intended. Instead of leaving an inheritance for their
children, parents could end up needing to be subsidized by them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone always quotes the Cornell University study that said
about $10.3 trillion is going to flow down from aging parents to
their children, but that study is seriously flawed,'' said Jerry
Potts, director of marketing for a Boston-based mutual fund
company. ''It didn't factor in longer life spans. It didn't factor
in health care costs, and it didn't factor in inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   For many individuals, the transfer of wealth will be the other
way, continued Potts, whose firm offers a specialized program for
adult children with aging parents. Often people assume that
Medicare will shoulder the biggest burden _ health care costs _ but
that's not always true. One thing Medicare generally won't cover is
long-term care, a topic parents may be very reluctant to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   If children are likely to be subsidizing parents, their own
financial plan should incorporate that need, according to financial
advisers. ''You can go through and do estate planning, save for
retirement, get all your investments in order, but if you ignore
your parents, all that could be wasted effort,'' said Potts. ''I
don't know of too many kids who could just say 'Sorry, you're on
your own' if their parents got sick or needed help. It can wipe out
a generation of wealth, and that's not being overly dramatic. It's
a fact.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also a fact that discussing money with parents won't be
easy, unless the family is unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ''Often parents won't cooperate, because they just can't believe
that their ducks aren't in order,'' said Joan Gruber, who owns a
financial planning firm in Dallas that specializes in helping adult
children deal with the issues of aging parents. ''Their idea is
they have a will and a power of attorney, so they are squared away.
But the will might be 20 years old and written in another state,
and the power of attorney might not be durable.'' That is, it might
not remain effective if the parent becomes disabled or incompetent.
</P>
<P>
   What can be done to avoid the problems Kimbrell and others have
faced? Financial experts offer the following tips:
</P>
<P>
   Broach the topic with sensitivity to the parents' needs and
feelings. Ease into the conversation by passing on a newspaper
article on the topic, or mention that you've started planning your
estate or preparing a will and you'd like to talk to them about how
they handled these issues. .
</P>
<P>
   ''Present it as it is _ a joint dilemma for you and your parents
to resolve together,'' said Susan C. Richards, a certified
financial planner and author of ''Protect Your Parents and Their
Financial Health...Talk With Them Before It's Too Late'' (Dearborn
Financial Publishing, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   Assemble the emergency paperwork. This includes a durable power
of attorney, a durable medical power of attorney, a living will and
a last will and testament. A durable power of attorney can allow
you to do such things as pay bills, deposit Social Security checks,
and make other financial decisions for a disabled or incompetent
parent. A durable medical power of attorney allows you to make
medical decisions on your parents' behalf. Without these documents,
you would have to go to court to be named guardian of an
incapacitated parent. And a living will expresses your parent's
wishes regarding the use of extraordinary measures that would delay
death in the event of a terminal illness. These documents need to
be reviewed and updated periodically, preferably by an elder law
attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Gruber calls these legal papers a passport to sanity _ when they
exist.
</P>
<P>
   Address your parents' health care needs. Make a list of the
names, addresses and phone numbers of all their physicians, their
pharmacy, their Medicare or Medicaid identification numbers and the
name and policy number of any additional insurance coverage.
Educate yourself about what Medicare will and won't cover to
determine if your parents need a supplemental policy. The
''Medicare &AMP; You Handbook,'' published by the Health Care Financing
Administration, can help.
</P>
<P>
   Find out if they have a long-term care policy. Does it cover
in-home care? If they don't have coverage, have they thought about
how they might meet those costs? A geriatric care manager _ a
professional who specializes in assisting older people and their
families with long-term care arrangements _ can describe the care
options available in your area and the costs involved.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare a personal inventory. Parents should list the name,
address and phone number of their accountant, attorney, banker,
stockbroker, all insurance agents, the employee benefits
administrator and religious adviser. The list should include all
account numbers; the whereabouts of the safe-deposit box and key;
important documents, such as birth certificates, trusts, wills,
deeds, car titles, bonds, Social Security cards, powers of attorney
and stock certificates; and burial instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Determine your parents' net worth and whether it is likely to
sustain them. Spreadsheet programs are available that allow you to
merge assets and liabilities with estimated returns on investments
and rates of inflation and tell you how long the money should last.
Financial advisers will also do this.
</P>
<P>
   Simplify the finances. ''A lot of parents have overly
complicated finances,'' said Richards. ''They have a CD here and
another one there. They have a rollover IRA somewhere else. Their
money is just scattered everywhere. It's really helpful if you can
talk your parents into having just one broker, one banker or one of
those master accounts where you just get one statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial advisers recommend approaching parents when they are
in their 60s _ about the time they retire. It's a natural time,
since they likely will be taking stock to plan for life after work.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are very difficult conversations to have, and it's
tempting to put it off, but you need to do it,'' said Richards.
''Do it now.''

ECO-FRIENDLY HOUSES SAVE MONEY AND RESOURCES
</HEADLINE>
  By JULIE MONAHAN 
 c.1999 ''E'' the environmental magazine 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In sizing up a prospective house, more and more homebuyers are
asking themselves how the property rates on the green scale.
</P>
<P>
   While most houses weigh in on the low end, a subtle shift is
underway as green building gains momentum among architects and
developers. Eco-construction is fast evolving beyond low-flow
toilets and energy-efficient appliances. From basement to attic,
homebuyers can find a host of eco-friendly innovations that
conserve energy, water and resources while maintaining the health
of inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   The first priority in evaluating a home is positioning.
Construction on an east-west axis for homes in temperate or cold
climates helps make the most of solar heat during the winter. East
and south windows can reap 57 percent of a home's heating require
ments through passive solar heating.
</P>
<P>
   In temperate and warm climates, windows and porches are best
placed to capture prevailing summer breezes while overhangs shade
the interior. Light shades of exterior paint work to reflect the
sun's heat and reduce cooling costs.
 &UR; Efficient Technology &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Today's homes are 35 percent more energy efficient than those
built 20 years ago. One factor is the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) Energy Star appliance program; another is newly
available technology.
</P>
<P>
   In green homes, high-tech means solar photovoltaic cells, heat
exchange ventilation systems, geothermal heat pumps, attic
ventilation systems and radiant heating powered by floor-based
cables.
</P>
<P>
   ''The baseline in all our green building work begins with energy
efficiency,'' says Bion D. Howard, a building environmental
scientist in Upper Marlboro, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Some favorites on Howard's list of energy savers are furnaces
equipped with clock thermostats, tubular skylights for places such
as closets or dark hallways that would otherwise be fit with
incandescent bulbs and kitchen floor pedal systems to control hot
and cold water flow and lower heating costs. The pedals alone can
save as much as 20 to 30 gallons of water per dishwashing
</P>
<P>
   Savvy homebuyers also look for heat preservers such as double-
and even triple-glazed windows, which help reduce the estimated 20
percent of energy typically lost through window panes.
</P>
<P>
   And utility companies may have something to contribute. Great
River Energy in Elk River, Minn., offers off-peak and cycling
programs that supply power to selected home appliances in 15-minute
increments.
</P>
<P>
   The homebuyer's checklist should identify potentially toxic
building materials, such as particle board or cabinetry made with
formaldehyde glues and preservatives. Safer alternatives exist,
though the materials may seem bizarre. For instance, builders
insulated a St. Louis, Miss., home with 3,000 recycled newspapers
treated with nontoxic flame retardant. Innovative manufacturers
have turned used soda bottles into carpeting, garden hoses into
roofing material and agricultural wheat straw waste into a particle
board replacement called agriboard.
 &UR; The Energy Audit &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Evaluating a new home may require some outside help. Formal
testing can be arranged through local power companies, which will
conduct energy audits. Radon testing is another good idea. Other
problems to watch out for include leaky roofs, insufficient grading
too close to damp soil, and signs of mold and mildew indicating
water seepage and a threat to air quality and materials
preservation. For houses with crawl spaces, look for passive
ventilation measures like vapor retarders combined with piping to
direct radon gases away from the home. These systems also keep
things drier.
</P>
<P>
   Basements deserve special attention.
</P>
<P>
   ''Seventy percent of a basement's moisture ends up in the rest
of your house,'' says Paul Frisette, director of the building
materials technology and management program at the University of
Massachusetts, Amherst. Moisture can raise allergen concentrations
indoors, reduce the life of materials and necessitate more frequent
paint jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Houses should have point source ventilation over stoves, in
bathrooms, anywhere moisture is generated.
</P>
<P>
   In managing the water a house does want, eco-friendly homes will
have a combination of low-flow shower heads, low-flow _ or even
no-flow _ composting toilets, high-efficiency washers, rainwater
catchments, and greywater systems for reusing household water in
the lawn or garden.
</P>
<P>
   One ambitious approach surrounds a Calgary, Canada, home with a
modest wetlands system. A water line directs the house's wastewater
from a settling tank to a plastic-lined gravel bed. Surrounding
marsh plants then help process the water before drainage to a
subsurface drain field.
</P>
<P>
   Green builders may debate the finer points of home construction,
but the bottom line is that no one approach will produce an
environmentally benign home. Each decision means weighing how
materials are made, how far they must be shipped and their degree
of recycability and durability.
</P>
<P>
   Although many consumers fret over high costs, builders report
that prices are coming down for some technologies. Homes that meet
the EPA's Energy Star standards cost just one to two percent more
than power guzzlers. And what costs more up-front often saves money
in the long run. CONTACT: Rocky Mountain Institute, 1739 Snowmass

bulge from Diggs' black T-shirt. His waist narrows as if it had
been created by a Disney animator. His hair is cut centimeters from
his scalp to frame a face that makes women melt.
 &HT;    It's the body of a man recently named by People magazine as one
of its ``Sexiest People Alive.'' But inside, Diggs insists, still
lurks the shy, insecure youth he was.
 &HT;    ``As a former nerd, it was a strange moment for me when People
magazine called to say that you are one of the most beautiful
humans on the planet,'' Diggs recalls. ``I had a good laugh about
it, but it was also gratifying on another level.
 &HT;    ``I've gone from nerd to sexiest man alive,'' the actor says,
laughing. ``There are days when you want to go back to that high
school, find your former tormentors and say, `OK, do you want to
re-evaluate?'''
 &HT;    Needless to say, it's all ``Stella's'' fault.
 &HT;    ``It's funny,'' he says, ``but for the first time in my life
brothers come up to me and say, `Taye, you've made my life
miserable with this movie. You were so sensitive and my girlfriend
thinks you're the perfect man. I can't measure up.'''
 &HT;    They can relax, though. In ``The Wood,'' opening July 16, Diggs
is anything but perfect, especially where women are concerned. His
character is a yuppie sort who bails out on the day of his wedding.
Suffering a bad case of pre-wedding jitters, he joins his best
friends (Omar Epps and Richard T. Jones) to look back on their past
relationships with women, their families and each other in a series
of flashbacks.
 &HT;    The title, incidentally, derives from Inglewood, Calif., where
writer/director Rick Famuyiwa grew up.
 &HT;    Diggs was offered a slew of scripts after ``Stella,'' but ``The
Wood'' was a natural, he says.
 &HT;    ``I had a very easy time with this character, because I related
to his situation of being at an age where you're making major life
decisions,'' Diggs says.
 &HT;    ``It was good for me to participate in this flick,'' he adds,
``because it made me realize you can really, truly, always have a
good time on a film set. I didn't necessarily have a great time
filming `Stella' or `Go.'''
 &HT;    Which isn't to say, he hastens to add, that he didn't like the
people he was working with.
 &HT;    ``I just found that these movies required a different style of
acting _ it wasn't very loose,'' he says. ``On `The Wood,' it
wasn't even acting. It was more like hanging out.''
 &HT;    The chemistry between the three buddies clicked almost
immediately, he adds. He recalls a scene in which his character
strips naked and use a garden hose to shower off before his
wedding.
 &HT;    Yes, ``Stella'' fans, it's another chance to see Diggs in the
altogether impressive.
 &HT;    ``I wanted it to be me in that scene. I'm not at the point where
I would ask for a butt double,'' he says, laughing. ``I don't
believe in star trips.''
 &HT;    On the day the scene was shot, however, he arrived to find Epps
and Johnson also in the buff _ a detail not called for in the
script.
 &HT;    ``We wanted to provide a little support for our brother,'' Epps
says in a separate interview. ``Plus we didn't want the women to
think that Taye was the only beefcake in this film.''
 &HT;    Actually, Diggs never aspired to beefcake status. Growing up in
Rochester, N.Y., and later in New York City, he saw himself as a
Broadway star, in preparation for which he earned a bachelor's
degree in musical theater from Syracuse University.
 &HT;    All set to pay his dues upon returning to New York _ he'd even
gotten a job serving pizza _ he was forced to cut short his
starving-actor days when, only a month after hitting town, he was
cast in the Broadway musical ``Carousel'' (1995). A year later, he
was playing Benny the landlord in the critically acclaimed musical
``Rent'' (1996).
 &HT;    Diggs stayed with ``Rent'' for almost two years, also appearing
in the soap opera ``Guiding Light'' and in guest roles on series
such as ``Law and Order'' and ``New York Undercover.''
 &HT;    Then came ``Stella'' and stardom _ but not necessarily
happiness, even when he was signed by Hollywood's top talent reps,
the Creative Artists Agency.
 &HT;    ``CAA sent me boxes of scripts right away, just to prove they
were working very hard for me,'' Diggs says. ``But not one of the
scripts really fit. Some of these scripts weren't really available
for me.
 &HT;    ``I finally had to tell them, `Look, don't send me this stuff
unless I'm absolutely right for it.'''
 &HT;    ``The Wood'' seemed absolutely right. So did his upcoming film,
``The Best Man'' _ which, coincidentally, casts Diggs as another
20-something guy worried about marriage. His character has also
written a tell-all book about the participants of a large wedding.
 &HT;    ``People at the wedding find out who slept with who and who was
a dog to women,'' Diggs says, smiling. ``It's all my fault.''
 &HT;    As for what's next, the actor isn't sure _ and he likes it that
way.
 &HT;    ``At this point, I want to take my career in segments,'' he
says. ``Right now I'm going through a stage where I just want to
have a good time. I want to try to avoid as much stress and as much
hype as possible. I don't want to worry about finding that Academy
Award-winning role _ I just want to have fun because I'm young now.
 &HT;    ``I realize that this business can be very stressful if you
approach it the wrong way,'' Diggs says. ``I'm just trying to walk
very softly and stay on my feet. I just enjoy the good things about
Hollywood, because the bad things will come no matter what.''
 &HT;    If things get rough, he adds, there's always the advice his
friend and co-star Bassett gave him on the set of ``How Stella Got
Her Groove Back.''
 &HT;    ``One day,'' he recalls, ``Angela pulled me aside and said, `Two
bits of advice: Don't believe your own hype and stay grounded.''
 &HT;    It was good advice.
 &HT;    ``Each day,'' Diggs says, ``I say to myself, `One second you're
the It Kid, and the next second you're on unemployment.'''

 (Includes a color slide of Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez,
directors of ``The Blair Witch Project.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Now, that's horror.
 &HT;    ``The Blair Witch Project,'' an ultra-low-budget horror flick
starring three unknowns and directed by two unknowns, will open on
July 16. Also opening that day is a somewhat higher-profile film,
``Eyes Wide Shut.'' Its stars are the somewhat better-known Tom
Cruise and Nicole Kidman, its director the late, legendary Stanley
Kubrick.
 &HT;    ``Blair Witch's'' co-creators, writer/directors Daniel Myrick
and Eduardo Sanchez, reject any idea of challenging the Warner
Bros. ``event movie,'' of course.
 &HT;    ``We're not competing with Kubrick,'' Sanchez says hastily. ``I
wouldn't dare say that.''
 &HT;    ``I'm not even pretending to nip at Kubrick's feet,'' Myrick
says. ``We're just thrilled we got `Blair Witch' made and that
someone's releasing it.''
 &HT;    The funny thing is that, in its own way, ``Blair Witch'' is
enjoying as much buzz as ``Eyes Wide Shut.'' Since it scared the
bejabbers out of audiences at the Sundance Film Festival and set
studio executives clamoring for distribution rights, horror
aficionados have psyched themselves up by visiting the film's
website _ at www.blairwitch.com _ and immersing themselves in the
expansive ``Blair Witch'' mythology.
 &HT;    So what is ``The Blair Witch Project?''
 &HT;    It's a faux documentary about three film students who, in 1994,
vanish in Maryland's Black Hills Forest while shooting a
documentary about an evil legend called the Blair Witch. A year
later, locals unearth their footage, which depicts five harrowing
days spent by the filmmakers, lost in the woods and terrorized by
forces unseen.
 &HT;    ``This is a horror film,'' Myrick says over breakfast at New
York's Paramount Hotel. ``Some people cringe when they hear the
term `horror,' but when I think of horror I think of leaving the
theater with some residual effect of psychological fear.
 &HT;    ``That's what `The Exorcist' (1973) and `The Shining' (1980) did
for me. The heart of our film is to scare you. That was our goal.
 &HT;    ``I think the `Scream' films are good,'' he adds, ``but they're
running their course. Movies work in cycles, and `Blair Witch'
comes back to what Hitchcock did, which was scare you
psychologically. None of our film's horror is on camera ... we've
let the audience imagine their own horror.''
 &HT;    The 35-year-old Myrick and the 30-year-old Sanchez weren't the
film's directors in any traditional sense, nor is its script a
standard screenplay. They positioned their actors _ Heather
Donahue, Joshua Leonard and Michael Williams _ out in the woods,
handed them cameras and sound equipment, and told them to improvise
their dialogue.
 &HT;    ``We set up the situations for them to act in naturally,''
Sanchez says. ``When the tent shakes and they hear voices at 3 in
the morning, that's us. Dan and I were the Blair Witch, and they
were really tired and scared.
 &HT;    ``We tried to push the actors to that threshold of what was real
and what was not. That's why we used their real names.''
 &HT;    ``We needed to logistically create a system that allowed us to
use this improv setup,'' Myrick adds. ``We had a Global Positioning
System and so did the actors, and that let us program points in the
woods where we wanted them to go. They could just hike through the
woods and film each other.
 &HT;    ``At different checkpoints, we had little baskets with spare
batteries, extra tapes, a little food and directing notes. Ed and I
were in fatigues, and we'd shadow the actors to observe their
performances.
 &HT;    ``At the end of the day we'd collect the tapes, analyze what was
going on and adjust our directing notes,'' he says. ``The actors
got individualized notes, and were instructed not to read each
other's notes.
 &HT;    ``For the most part, directing was casting the right people and
guiding them through this world,'' he concludes. ``After we
wrapped, there was the editing process, which required wrangling
eight days of footage and getting it down to about 90 minutes.''
 &HT;    ``The film was not directed in a traditional way,'' Sanchez
says. ``We more or less wrote the script during the editing
process. If somebody else edited the footage, they probably
would've found two or three other movies in there.''
 &HT;    Myrick and Sanchez had worked together for eight years, since
meeting in 1990 at the University of Central Florida in Orlando.
But after collaborating on several short films and unproduced
scripts, they were ready to call it quits if ``Blair Witch'' went
unnoticed.
 &HT;    ``We've had our series of failures _ more than I want to
count,'' Myrick says with a sardonic grin. ``We were at the stage
where we really were thinking, `If this doesn't make it, I'm going
back to bartending.' It was our last hurrah, in a sense.''
 &HT;    The world will have to make do with two fewer bartenders.
``Blair Witch'' was accepted into Sundance, and as soon as it had
its first screening, the only question was which distributor would
come up with it. Eventually, it was Artisan Films which made the
best offer.
 &HT;    Now there's no escaping ``Blair Witch.'' It's on every must-see
list, and a terrifying number of ``Blair Witch'' tie-ins are on the
way, including a Sci-Fi Channel mock-documentary called ``Curse of
the Blair Witch,'' airing on July 12. And there's a comic book, a
Penguin Books ``investigative report'' and even ``Josh's Blair
Witch Mix,'' a CD compilation featuring 1980s tunes supposedly on a
cassette in the tape deck of Joshua Leonard's car at the time of
his disappearance.
 &HT;    Detractors are already crying ``Sellout!'' Naturally, Myrick and
Sanchez think otherwise.
 &HT;    ``I guess somebody could see it as selling out, but everything
we're doing is complementary to the film,'' Myrick says. ``It's all
part of the mythology we've built around the film, and it's just
made it more fun for everyone who's gotten involved.
 &HT;    ``People are embracing the film and thinking of it as their
own,'' he adds. ``They're saying, `This is my little secret' or
telling friends about it or adding to the mythology that's already
there.
 &HT;    ``That's what amazes me more than anything.''
 &HT;    Even before ``Blair Witch'' faces real-world audiences, its
creators are benefiting from its buzz. Myrick and Sanchez are
busily scripting ``Heart of Love,'' an ``off-the-wall screwball
comedy'' that Artisan will finance.
 &HT;    ``We've been tinkering with ideas for years,'' Myrick says,
``and now we're really writing the script. `Blair Witch' was just a
fluke of an idea that happened to come together as a movie, but
we've wanted to make `Heart of Love' for a long time.''
 &HT;    And, of course, Hollywood is beckoning.
 &HT;    ``We're getting a lot of bad scripts sent to us now,'' Sanchez
says with a laugh. ``The industry probably thinks of us as this new
horror team, but we're not.
 &HT;    ``If `Blair Witch' comes out and does gangbusters, we'll have
more options,'' he says, ``though we'll probably still do `Heart of
Love' next. If `Blair Witch' tanks, we'll have to be a little less
selective.''
 &HT;    Myrick nods in agreement.
 &HT;    ``I think we're in a good position,'' he says. ``Even if `Blair
Witch' doesn't make millions and millions of dollars, our investors
are already happy.
 &HT;    ``We'd just go back and make the smaller films we want to
make,'' Myrick says. ``The best thing about `Blair Witch,' as Ed
said, is that it's given us options.
 &HT;    ``We just have to be smart now about our next steps.''

TERMS WITH FAME

 (Includes a color slide of Donny Osmond with Marie Osmond in a
scene from ``The Donny and Marie Show.'') 
 By CHRISTOPHER LOUDON  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Donny Osmond doesn't care what you think of him.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure, he'd rather you liked him. But it doesn't matter that
much to him _ and that very fact is something special for Osmond,
who not so long ago was so consumed with the desire to please that
it derailed his career and nearly ruined his life.
</P>
<P>
   We all remember the squeaky-clean kid who sang with his
brothers, soared to solo fame, scored huge television ratings
alongside sister Marie, suffered through a long spate of anonymity
_ including renaming himself ``Don Osmond'' _ and then reinvented
himself with four solid years of success in the Tim Rice/Andrew
Lloyd Webber musical, ``Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor
Dreamcoat,'' before reuniting with his sister for a successful talk
show, ``Donny &AMP; Marie.''
</P>
<P>
   Few, however, have witnessed the flip side of that
bright-and-smiling image, a history of self-doubts, debilitating
fears and serious reversals of fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Now the 41-year-old father of four is setting the record
straight with his candid autobiography, ``Life Is Just What You
Make It'' (Hyperion, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   LOUDON: Was it tougher than you expected to tell your own story?
</P>
<P>
   DONNY OSMOND: Much tougher. I decided that if I was going to
take the time to do this, I really had to dig deep, to disclose the
real Donny Osmond and what I've been through in my life.
</P>
<P>
   I also wanted to share all the big experiences and explore the
roller coaster of show business. I'm working on my fourth or fifth
career _ most people are lucky just to have one.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You credit Andy Williams and Jerry Lewis as major influences
in your formative years.
</P>
<P>
   OSMOND: Andy really helped me as far as my singing was
concerned. I learned how to sing just by listening to him.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry helped me so much with timing, and with comedy in general.
My brothers and I were regulars on his variety show around 1967 or
'68. He'd play a character called Ralph Rotten, and he wanted me to
play Ralph Rotten Jr. I learned more from him during that season
than I can ever imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There was a time, around age 12 or 13, when you were arguably
the most famous person in the world ...
</P>
<P>
   OSMOND: That reminds me of a story. It was around 1973 or '74,
at the very height of the teenybopperdom. I got a letter addressed
to just ``Donny Osmond.'' No address, nothing.
</P>
<P>
   It came from Sweden, and I guess some Swedish postman said,
``Donny Osmond? Oh, yeah, send it to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   When it got to the States, somebody at the post office must've
said, ``Osmond? That's Utah.''
</P>
<P>
   When it arrived in Utah, the postmaster here said, ``Oh, I get a
lot of these, I know where to send it.''
</P>
<P>
   And so a fan letter arrived from halfway around the world, with
nothing on the envelope but my name. That's better than Santa
Claus!
</P>
<P>
   But along with that comes a lot of responsibility. I always had
to suppress my feelings. I had to maintain a certain kind of
boy-next-door image because I was Donny Osmond. I would get letters
from fans saying, ``Donny, you can't say that!'' or ``Donny, you
can't do that!''
</P>
<P>
   It got so bad that, just before ``Joseph'' opened for the fourth
time in Toronto, I had what they called a nervous breakdown, but it
was more of an anxiety attack.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Didn't a therapist help you through that?
</P>
<P>
   OSMOND: Just before the Toronto opening, Geraldine Ross flew in
to help get me back on stage. She's the same lady who got Barbra
Streisand back on stage _ Barbra suffered from a very similar
thing, perfectionism, type A personality.
</P>
<P>
   So I walked on stage before they let the audience in, and there
was a group of ushers sitting in the theater getting briefed. And I
was having a major panic attack.
</P>
<P>
   I turned my back on them and started talking to Geraldine about
it. Ten or 15 minutes went by and she asked, ``Are you still having
the problem?''
</P>
<P>
   I said, ``Yes!'' I said it was because I knew the ushers were
staring at me and talking about me.
</P>
<P>
   She said, ``Turn around, muster up enough energy to turn and
face them.''
</P>
<P>
   So I turned around _ and they were gone. There was nobody there!
It was all in my mind.
</P>
<P>
   I was blowing things so far out of proportion, and that was the
toll of all those years of suppressing my real feelings for the
sake of maintaining an image.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Given all the trouble it's been to you, how can you find any
humor in your teen-idol image?
</P>
<P>
   OSMOND: I remember back in 1989, when I released ``Soldier of
Love.'' I wanted so badly to get back on the charts, and worked so
hard for it. Slowly it started to happen, and all these radio
stations wanted me to appear on their morning ``zoo'' programs.
</P>
<P>
   Those morning hosts can be scathing, and every time I went in to
promote my music they'd just let me have it _ bugging me about
``Puppy Love'' or the purple socks or whatever. And it would drive
me crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Then one day I realized that I had to go in there and make fun
of myself before they had a chance to. And it totally defused them.
They'd realize, ``Hey, this guy doesn't take himself seriously, we
can have fun with his image.'' And we'd sing ``Puppy Love'' and
move on.
</P>
<P>
   You can't take yourself too seriously, and you can't worry about
it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The talk category has become one of the most competitive in
television. What prompted you and Marie to enter the fray?
</P>
<P>
   OSMOND: I didn't want to do another variety show, because that
doesn't work anymore. And I really didn't want to do anything with
Marie, and she felt the same way toward me, because we both wanted
to focus on our individual careers.
</P>
<P>
   But when Dick Clark wanted to produce this thing, it suddenly
seemed right. Marie and I deliberated for a long, long time about
it. We realized that it was going to be a tremendous amount of
work, but we finally agreed because it felt so right.
</P>
<P>
   And a few weeks ago we found out that the ratings were going
through the roof and we've been picked up for next season, so
things couldn't look better.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has your family read the book?
</P>
<P>
   OSMOND: Yes, they have. As a matter of fact, my father called me
after I sent him the final manuscript. He said, ``I can't believe
you went through this kind of life.'' My own father!
</P>
<P>
   Q: You seem to have come through it with flying colors, though.
What's your secret?
</P>
<P>
   OSMOND: Every case is different, but for me it was just
perseverance and realizing that the business I'm in is fleeting.
The ups are really, really up, and the downs are really, really
down. I've lived a life of extremes.
</P>
<P>
   What I've learned from it all is that you can't really base your
happiness on outward success, because you never know how long it's
going to last. So I've learned to appreciate my family more,
particularly my wife and children.
</P>
<P>
   That's the only place true happiness can come from.

 By MARGY HOLLAND  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Mary Chapin Carpenter has never been one to follow the pack.
Even when she does a greatest-hits album, it's got to be a little
different.
 &HT;    ``Party Doll And Other Favorites,'' released in May, is a
greatest-hits collection done Carpenter's way. When Sony Music
suggested that her seventh Sony album be a retrospective, the
singer/songwriter says, she didn't want to simply sign off on a
potpourri of old singles.
 &HT;    ``I saw it as the opportunity to veer widely from the formula,''
she says. ``The formula for greatest-hits records, from what I've
been able to see, is seven or eight of the best-charting songs.
Then you add maybe two new songs, and that's the greatest-hits
record.
 &HT;    ``I thought, `Well, let's try to be humble here and assume you
don't have an opportunity every day to release a greatest-hits
record to begin with,''' she says. ``Why not make the most out of
that opportunity, not do the formula and make it much more than a
greatest-hits record?''
 &HT;    The resulting album offers old favorites such as ``I Feel
Lucky,'' ``Passionate Kisses'' and ``He Thinks He'll Keep Her,''
but most of the recordings are live, not the original studio
versions that first became hits.
 &HT;    Beyond the tried-and-true, ``Party Doll And Other Favorites''
also includes songs from special projects, such as ``10,000 Miles''
_ written for the film ``Fly Away Home'' (1996) _ as well as two
new Carpenter-penned songs. Then there's the title track, ``Party
Doll,'' a Mick Jagger tune which Carpenter regularly performs in
her live shows but had never recorded for an album.
 &HT;    ``It seems to me that, in the last few years, I see artists
who've had maybe one or two records out, then the next record's a
greatest-hits, and I think, `Well, that's not very long of a life
there,''' Carpenter says.
 &HT;    ``I think a lot of times it's more an excuse on the part of the
record company to promote some filler or buy some time for
something else,'' she adds. ``I think in each case you have to be
careful to look at it and see what it really is for. Is it really
something of a retrospective, or is it an excuse for something
else?''
 &HT;    Of course, a retrospective collection also has implications as
far as her career is concerned. The singer/songwriter admits to
having been taken aback when she recently heard the album described
by a journalist as ``a midcareer record.''
 &HT;    ``My reaction was, `It is? I'm still getting started!'''
Carpenter says. ``But then I realized he was absolutely right. I've
been doing this for 10 years, at the very least, with a record
company, and many years prior to that, so I better get current with
myself and realize I'm not just starting out.''
 &HT;    Upon reflection, she decided to flaunt the fact that she's made
it this far, while still keeping oriented toward the future.
 &HT;    ``You know,'' she adds, ``if it's midcareer, then there's a lot
ahead of me, too.''
 &HT;    Given her five Grammy awards, three platinum albums and 12
top-10 singles, Carpenter found choosing the material to be
included on ``Party Doll And Other Favorites'' to be no easy task.
Revisiting a decade's worth of songs, she admits, was a trip down
memory lane, and not always a pleasant one.
 &HT;    ``Did I cringe? Were some cringe-worthy things there?
Absolutely,'' Carpenter says, laughing. ``There were things there
I'd sooner forget, and there were other things that I was just
delighted by that I had forgotten about and that I was proud of.
 &HT;    ``On the one hand, it was really humbling to go back,'' she
says, ``humbling from the standpoint of I sort of was reacquainted
once again with a lot of these projects or opportunities or events
that I'd gotten to participate in, and it was like, `Wow, that was
great.'
 &HT;    ``Then, on the other hand, it was like, `Where did all that time
go?' It was kind of bittersweet, too.''
 &HT;    Those years haven't been spent exclusively in the recording
studio or on tour, either. Carpenter has performed at a
presidential inauguration and for American troops in the Middle
East, as well as put substantial time and money into a variety of
groups promoting environmentalism, literacy and social change.
 &HT;    ``I think you owe it to yourself to do it,'' she says. ``And
that's not a guilt trip, but rather an invitation to get back more
than you give.
 &HT;    ``It's not hard to merge what you love with what's important to
you,'' Carpenter adds. ``What I love, obviously, is playing music,
and what's important to me are the various issues that I align
myself with, and to be able to merge them is simple.''
 &HT;    In the end, she says, she's never been able to come up with an
acceptable excuse for simply sitting on her hands when others need
help.
 &HT;    ``You realize you're in trouble if you think you're too busy or
that you haven't got the time or you're too tired,'' she says,
``because the minute you get out there, you're energized. All the
stuff that makes you feel too busy falls away, and you meet people
who change you.
 &HT;    ``It's not about politics,'' Carpenter concludes. ``It's
humanist _ it has nothing to do with politics, but it has
everything to do with just being a human being.''

KNOCK ON `WOOD': TAYE DIGGS MAY HAVE FOUND HIS BREAKOUT ROLE

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of Taye Diggs with Richard T. Jones and
Omar Epps in a scene from ``The Wood.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Looking at handsome, hardbodied Taye Diggs today, it's hard to
believe that he was a nerd in high school.
 &HT;    He swears he was, though. Subtract some extra pounds of muscle,
add thick black glasses with tape on the sides, and that was him.
 &HT;    ``I had no friends,'' he says. ``Girls laughed at me. I was
never picked for any sports team.''
 &HT;    The girls stopped laughing some time back. As Diggs relaxes in a
suite at Los Angeles' posh Four Seasons Hotel, the lobby below is
filled with a swarm of women who've gathered in hope of catching a
glimpse of the man who gave Angela Bassett a whole new angle on
life in last summer's hit, ``How Stella Got Her Groove Back,'' and
gave ``Go'' (1999) some of its go.
 &HT;    If they get that glimpse, they won't be disappointed. Biceps
bulge from Diggs' black T-shirt. His waist narrows as if it had
been created by a Disney animator. His hair is cut centimeters from
his scalp to frame a face that makes women melt.
 &HT;    It's the body of a man recently named by People magazine as one
of its ``Sexiest People Alive.'' But inside, Diggs insists, still
lurks the shy, insecure youth he was.
 &HT;    ``As a former nerd, it was a strange moment for me when People
magazine called to say that you are one of the most beautiful
humans on the planet,'' Diggs recalls. ``I had a good laugh about
it, but it was also gratifying on another level.
 &HT;    ``I've gone from nerd to sexiest man alive,'' the actor says,
laughing. ``There are days when you want to go back to that high
school, find your former tormentors and say, `OK, do you want to
re-evaluate?'''
 &HT;    Needless to say, it's all ``Stella's'' fault.
 &HT;    ``It's funny,'' he says, ``but for the first time in my life
brothers come up to me and say, `Taye, you've made my life
miserable with this movie. You were so sensitive and my girlfriend
thinks you're the perfect man. I can't measure up.'''
 &HT;    They can relax, though. In ``The Wood,'' opening July 16, Diggs
is anything but perfect, especially where women are concerned. His
character is a yuppie sort who bails out on the day of his wedding.
Suffering a bad case of pre-wedding jitters, he joins his best
friends (Omar Epps and Richard T. Jones) to look back on their past
relationships with women, their families and each other in a series
of flashbacks.
 &HT;    The title, incidentally, derives from Inglewood, Calif., where
writer/director Rick Famuyiwa grew up.
 &HT;    Diggs was offered a slew of scripts after ``Stella,'' but ``The
Wood'' was a natural, he says.
 &HT;    ``I had a very easy time with this character, because I related
to his situation of being at an age where you're making major life
decisions,'' Diggs says.
 &HT;    ``It was good for me to participate in this flick,'' he adds,
``because it made me realize you can really, truly, always have a
good time on a film set. I didn't necessarily have a great time
filming `Stella' or `Go.'''
 &HT;    Which isn't to say, he hastens to add, that he didn't like the
people he was working with.
 &HT;    ``I just found that these movies required a different style of
acting _ it wasn't very loose,'' he says. ``On `The Wood,' it
wasn't even acting. It was more like hanging out.''
 &HT;    The chemistry between the three buddies clicked almost
immediately, he adds. He recalls a scene in which his character
strips naked and use a garden hose to shower off before his
wedding.
 &HT;    Yes, ``Stella'' fans, it's another chance to see Diggs in the
altogether impressive.
 &HT;    ``I wanted it to be me in that scene. I'm not at the point where
I would ask for a butt double,'' he says, laughing. ``I don't
believe in star trips.''
 &HT;    On the day the scene was shot, however, he arrived to find Epps
and Johnson also in the buff _ a detail not called for in the
script.
 &HT;    ``We wanted to provide a little support for our brother,'' Epps
says in a separate interview. ``Plus we didn't want the women to
think that Taye was the only beefcake in this film.''
 &HT;    Actually, Diggs never aspired to beefcake status. Growing up in
Rochester, N.Y., and later in New York City, he saw himself as a
Broadway star, in preparation for which he earned a bachelor's
degree in musical theater from Syracuse University.
 &HT;    All set to pay his dues upon returning to New York _ he'd even
gotten a job serving pizza _ he was forced to cut short his
starving-actor days when, only a month after hitting town, he was
cast in the Broadway musical ``Carousel'' (1995). A year later, he
was playing Benny the landlord in the critically acclaimed musical
``Rent'' (1996).
 &HT;    Diggs stayed with ``Rent'' for almost two years, also appearing
in the soap opera ``Guiding Light'' and in guest roles on series
such as ``Law and Order'' and ``New York Undercover.''
 &HT;    Then came ``Stella'' and stardom _ but not necessarily
happiness, even when he was signed by Hollywood's top talent reps,
the Creative Artists Agency.
 &HT;    ``CAA sent me boxes of scripts right away, just to prove they
were working very hard for me,'' Diggs says. ``But not one of the
scripts really fit. Some of these scripts weren't really available
for me.
 &HT;    ``I finally had to tell them, `Look, don't send me this stuff
unless I'm absolutely right for it.'''
 &HT;    ``The Wood'' seemed absolutely right. So did his upcoming film,
``The Best Man'' _ which, coincidentally, casts Diggs as another
20-something guy worried about marriage. His character has also
written a tell-all book about the participants of a large wedding.
 &HT;    ``People at the wedding find out who slept with who and who was
a dog to women,'' Diggs says, smiling. ``It's all my fault.''
 &HT;    As for what's next, the actor isn't sure _ and he likes it that
way.
 &HT;    ``At this point, I want to take my career in segments,'' he
says. ``Right now I'm going through a stage where I just want to
have a good time. I want to try to avoid as much stress and as much
hype as possible. I don't want to worry about finding that Academy
Award-winning role _ I just want to have fun because I'm young now.
 &HT;    ``I realize that this business can be very stressful if you
approach it the wrong way,'' Diggs says. ``I'm just trying to walk
very softly and stay on my feet. I just enjoy the good things about
Hollywood, because the bad things will come no matter what.''
 &HT;    If things get rough, he adds, there's always the advice his
friend and co-star Bassett gave him on the set of ``How Stella Got
Her Groove Back.''
 &HT;    ``One day,'' he recalls, ``Angela pulled me aside and said, `Two
bits of advice: Don't believe your own hype and stay grounded.''
 &HT;    It was good advice.
 &HT;    ``Each day,'' Diggs says, ``I say to myself, `One second you're
the It Kid, and the next second you're on unemployment.'''

BROOMSTICKS NEED NOT APPLY: THE SCARY NEW WORLD OF `THE BLAIR WITCH
PROJECT'

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez,
directors of ``The Blair Witch Project.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Now, that's horror.
 &HT;    ``The Blair Witch Project,'' an ultra-low-budget horror flick
starring three unknowns and directed by two unknowns, will open on
July 16. Also opening that day is a somewhat higher-profile film,
``Eyes Wide Shut.'' Its stars are the somewhat better-known Tom
Cruise and Nicole Kidman, its director the late, legendary Stanley
Kubrick.
 &HT;    ``Blair Witch's'' co-creators, writer/directors Daniel Myrick
and Eduardo Sanchez, reject any idea of challenging the Warner
Bros. ``event movie,'' of course.
 &HT;    ``We're not competing with Kubrick,'' Sanchez says hastily. ``I
wouldn't dare say that.''
 &HT;    ``I'm not even pretending to nip at Kubrick's feet,'' Myrick
says. ``We're just thrilled we got `Blair Witch' made and that
someone's releasing it.''
 &HT;    The funny thing is that, in its own way, ``Blair Witch'' is
enjoying as much buzz as ``Eyes Wide Shut.'' Since it scared the
bejabbers out of audiences at the Sundance Film Festival and set
studio executives clamoring for distribution rights, horror
aficionados have psyched themselves up by visiting the film's
website _ at www.blairwitch.com _ and immersing themselves in the
expansive ``Blair Witch'' mythology.
 &HT;    So what is ``The Blair Witch Project?''
 &HT;    It's a faux documentary about three film students who, in 1994,
vanish in Maryland's Black Hills Forest while shooting a
documentary about an evil legend called the Blair Witch. A year
later, locals unearth their footage, which depicts five harrowing
days spent by the filmmakers, lost in the woods and terrorized by
forces unseen.
 &HT;    ``This is a horror film,'' Myrick says over breakfast at New
York's Paramount Hotel. ``Some people cringe when they hear the
term `horror,' but when I think of horror I think of leaving the
theater with some residual effect of psychological fear.
 &HT;    ``That's what `The Exorcist' (1973) and `The Shining' (1980) did
for me. The heart of our film is to scare you. That was our goal.
 &HT;    ``I think the `Scream' films are good,'' he adds, ``but they're
running their course. Movies work in cycles, and `Blair Witch'
comes back to what Hitchcock did, which was scare you
psychologically. None of our film's horror is on camera ... we've
let the audience imagine their own horror.''
 &HT;    The 35-year-old Myrick and the 30-year-old Sanchez weren't the
film's directors in any traditional sense, nor is its script a
standard screenplay. They positioned their actors _ Heather
Donahue, Joshua Leonard and Michael Williams _ out in the woods,
handed them cameras and sound equipment, and told them to improvise
their dialogue.
 &HT;    ``We set up the situations for them to act in naturally,''
Sanchez says. ``When the tent shakes and they hear voices at 3 in
the morning, that's us. Dan and I were the Blair Witch, and they
were really tired and scared.
 &HT;    ``We tried to push the actors to that threshold of what was real
and what was not. That's why we used their real names.''
 &HT;    ``We needed to logistically create a system that allowed us to
use this improv setup,'' Myrick adds. ``We had a Global Positioning
System and so did the actors, and that let us program points in the
woods where we wanted them to go. They could just hike through the
woods and film each other.
 &HT;    ``At different checkpoints, we had little baskets with spare
batteries, extra tapes, a little food and directing notes. Ed and I
were in fatigues, and we'd shadow the actors to observe their
performances.
 &HT;    ``At the end of the day we'd collect the tapes, analyze what was
going on and adjust our directing notes,'' he says. ``The actors
got individualized notes, and were instructed not to read each
other's notes.
 &HT;    ``For the most part, directing was casting the right people and
guiding them through this world,'' he concludes. ``After we
wrapped, there was the editing process, which required wrangling
eight days of footage and getting it down to about 90 minutes.''
 &HT;    ``The film was not directed in a traditional way,'' Sanchez
says. ``We more or less wrote the script during the editing
process. If somebody else edited the footage, they probably
would've found two or three other movies in there.''
 &HT;    Myrick and Sanchez had worked together for eight years, since
meeting in 1990 at the University of Central Florida in Orlando.
But after collaborating on several short films and unproduced
scripts, they were ready to call it quits if ``Blair Witch'' went
unnoticed.
 &HT;    ``We've had our series of failures _ more than I want to
count,'' Myrick says with a sardonic grin. ``We were at the stage
where we really were thinking, `If this doesn't make it, I'm going
back to bartending.' It was our last hurrah, in a sense.''
 &HT;    The world will have to make do with two fewer bartenders.
``Blair Witch'' was accepted into Sundance, and as soon as it had
its first screening, the only question was which distributor would
come up with it. Eventually, it was Artisan Films which made the
best offer.
 &HT;    Now there's no escaping ``Blair Witch.'' It's on every must-see
list, and a terrifying number of ``Blair Witch'' tie-ins are on the
way, including a Sci-Fi Channel mock-documentary called ``Curse of
the Blair Witch,'' airing on July 12. And there's a comic book, a
Penguin Books ``investigative report'' and even ``Josh's Blair
Witch Mix,'' a CD compilation featuring 1980s tunes supposedly on a
cassette in the tape deck of Joshua Leonard's car at the time of
his disappearance.
 &HT;    Detractors are already crying ``Sellout!'' Naturally, Myrick and
Sanchez think otherwise.
 &HT;    ``I guess somebody could see it as selling out, but everything
we're doing is complementary to the film,'' Myrick says. ``It's all
part of the mythology we've built around the film, and it's just
made it more fun for everyone who's gotten involved.
 &HT;    ``People are embracing the film and thinking of it as their
own,'' he adds. ``They're saying, `This is my little secret' or
telling friends about it or adding to the mythology that's already
there.
 &HT;    ``That's what amazes me more than anything.''
 &HT;    Even before ``Blair Witch'' faces real-world audiences, its
creators are benefiting from its buzz. Myrick and Sanchez are
busily scripting ``Heart of Love,'' an ``off-the-wall screwball
comedy'' that Artisan will finance.
 &HT;    ``We've been tinkering with ideas for years,'' Myrick says,
``and now we're really writing the script. `Blair Witch' was just a
fluke of an idea that happened to come together as a movie, but
we've wanted to make `Heart of Love' for a long time.''
 &HT;    And, of course, Hollywood is beckoning.
 &HT;    ``We're getting a lot of bad scripts sent to us now,'' Sanchez
says with a laugh. ``The industry probably thinks of us as this new
horror team, but we're not.
 &HT;    ``If `Blair Witch' comes out and does gangbusters, we'll have
more options,'' he says, ``though we'll probably still do `Heart of
Love' next. If `Blair Witch' tanks, we'll have to be a little less
selective.''
 &HT;    Myrick nods in agreement.
 &HT;    ``I think we're in a good position,'' he says. ``Even if `Blair
Witch' doesn't make millions and millions of dollars, our investors
are already happy.
 &HT;    ``We'd just go back and make the smaller films we want to
make,'' Myrick says. ``The best thing about `Blair Witch,' as Ed
said, is that it's given us options.
 &HT;    ``We just have to be smart now about our next steps.''

<P>
   Donny Osmond doesn't care what you think of him.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure, he'd rather you liked him. But it doesn't matter that
much to him _ and that very fact is something special for Osmond,
who not so long ago was so consumed with the desire to please that
it derailed his career and nearly ruined his life.
</P>
<P>
   We all remember the squeaky-clean kid who sang with his
brothers, soared to solo fame, scored huge television ratings
alongside sister Marie, suffered through a long spate of anonymity
_ including renaming himself ``Don Osmond'' _ and then reinvented
himself with four solid years of success in the Tim Rice/Andrew
Lloyd Webber musical, ``Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor
Dreamcoat,'' before reuniting with his sister for a successful talk
show, ``Donny &AMP; Marie.''

bright-and-smiling image, a history of self-doubts, debilitating
fears and serious reversals of fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Now the 41-year-old father of four is setting the record
straight with his candid autobiography, ``Life Is Just What You
Make It'' (Hyperion, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   LOUDON: Was it tougher than you expected to tell your own story?
</P>
<P>
   DONNY OSMOND: Much tougher. I decided that if I was going to
take the time to do this, I really had to dig deep, to disclose the
real Donny Osmond and what I've been through in my life.
</P>
<P>
   I also wanted to share all the big experiences and explore the
roller coaster of show business. I'm working on my fourth or fifth
career _ most people are lucky just to have one.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You credit Andy Williams and Jerry Lewis as major influences
in your formative years.
</P>
<P>
   OSMOND: Andy really helped me as far as my singing was
concerned. I learned how to sing just by listening to him.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry helped me so much with timing, and with comedy in general.
My brothers and I were regulars on his variety show around 1967 or
'68. He'd play a character called Ralph Rotten, and he wanted me to
play Ralph Rotten Jr. I learned more from him during that season
than I can ever imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There was a time, around age 12 or 13, when you were arguably
the most famous person in the world ...
</P>
<P>
   OSMOND: That reminds me of a story. It was around 1973 or '74,
at the very height of the teenybopperdom. I got a letter addressed
to just ``Donny Osmond.'' No address, nothing.
</P>
<P>
   It came from Sweden, and I guess some Swedish postman said,
``Donny Osmond? Oh, yeah, send it to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   When it got to the States, somebody at the post office must've
said, ``Osmond? That's Utah.''
</P>
<P>
   When it arrived in Utah, the postmaster here said, ``Oh, I get a
lot of these, I know where to send it.''
</P>
<P>
   And so a fan letter arrived from halfway around the world, with
nothing on the envelope but my name. That's better than Santa
Claus!
</P>
<P>
   But along with that comes a lot of responsibility. I always had
to suppress my feelings. I had to maintain a certain kind of
boy-next-door image because I was Donny Osmond. I would get letters
from fans saying, ``Donny, you can't say that!'' or ``Donny, you
can't do that!''
</P>
<P>
   It got so bad that, just before ``Joseph'' opened for the fourth
time in Toronto, I had what they called a nervous breakdown, but it
was more of an anxiety attack.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Didn't a therapist help you through that?
</P>
<P>
   OSMOND: Just before the Toronto opening, Geraldine Ross flew in
to help get me back on stage. She's the same lady who got Barbra
Streisand back on stage _ Barbra suffered from a very similar
thing, perfectionism, type A personality.
</P>
<P>
   So I walked on stage before they let the audience in, and there
was a group of ushers sitting in the theater getting briefed. And I
was having a major panic attack.
</P>
<P>
   I turned my back on them and started talking to Geraldine about
it. Ten or 15 minutes went by and she asked, ``Are you still having
the problem?''
</P>
<P>
   I said, ``Yes!'' I said it was because I knew the ushers were
staring at me and talking about me.
</P>
<P>
   She said, ``Turn around, muster up enough energy to turn and
face them.''
</P>
<P>
   So I turned around _ and they were gone. There was nobody there!
It was all in my mind.
</P>
<P>
   I was blowing things so far out of proportion, and that was the
toll of all those years of suppressing my real feelings for the
sake of maintaining an image.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Given all the trouble it's been to you, how can you find any
humor in your teen-idol image?
</P>
<P>
   OSMOND: I remember back in 1989, when I released ``Soldier of
Love.'' I wanted so badly to get back on the charts, and worked so
hard for it. Slowly it started to happen, and all these radio
stations wanted me to appear on their morning ``zoo'' programs.
</P>
<P>
   Those morning hosts can be scathing, and every time I went in to
promote my music they'd just let me have it _ bugging me about
``Puppy Love'' or the purple socks or whatever. And it would drive
me crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Then one day I realized that I had to go in there and make fun
of myself before they had a chance to. And it totally defused them.
They'd realize, ``Hey, this guy doesn't take himself seriously, we
can have fun with his image.'' And we'd sing ``Puppy Love'' and
move on.
</P>
<P>
   You can't take yourself too seriously, and you can't worry about
it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The talk category has become one of the most competitive in
television. What prompted you and Marie to enter the fray?
</P>
<P>
   OSMOND: I didn't want to do another variety show, because that
doesn't work anymore. And I really didn't want to do anything with
Marie, and she felt the same way toward me, because we both wanted
to focus on our individual careers.
</P>
<P>
   But when Dick Clark wanted to produce this thing, it suddenly
seemed right. Marie and I deliberated for a long, long time about
it. We realized that it was going to be a tremendous amount of
work, but we finally agreed because it felt so right.
</P>
<P>
   And a few weeks ago we found out that the ratings were going
through the roof and we've been picked up for next season, so
things couldn't look better.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has your family read the book?
</P>
<P>
   OSMOND: Yes, they have. As a matter of fact, my father called me
after I sent him the final manuscript. He said, ``I can't believe
you went through this kind of life.'' My own father!
</P>
<P>
   Q: You seem to have come through it with flying colors, though.
What's your secret?
</P>
<P>
   OSMOND: Every case is different, but for me it was just
perseverance and realizing that the business I'm in is fleeting.
The ups are really, really up, and the downs are really, really
down. I've lived a life of extremes.
</P>
<P>
   What I've learned from it all is that you can't really base your
happiness on outward success, because you never know how long it's
going to last. So I've learned to appreciate my family more,
particularly my wife and children.
</P>
<P>
   That's the only place true happiness can come from.

MADE FOR MUSIC: MARY CHAPIN CARPENTER LOOKS BACK 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of country singer Mary Chapin Carpenter.) 
 By MARGY HOLLAND  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Mary Chapin Carpenter has never been one to follow the pack.
Even when she does a greatest-hits album, it's got to be a little
different.
 &HT;    ``Party Doll And Other Favorites,'' released in May, is a
greatest-hits collection done Carpenter's way. When Sony Music
suggested that her seventh Sony album be a retrospective, the
singer/songwriter says, she didn't want to simply sign off on a
potpourri of old singles.
 &HT;    ``I saw it as the opportunity to veer widely from the formula,''
she says. ``The formula for greatest-hits records, from what I've
been able to see, is seven or eight of the best-charting songs.
Then you add maybe two new songs, and that's the greatest-hits
record.
 &HT;    ``I thought, `Well, let's try to be humble here and assume you
don't have an opportunity every day to release a greatest-hits
record to begin with,''' she says. ``Why not make the most out of
that opportunity, not do the formula and make it much more than a
greatest-hits record?''
 &HT;    The resulting album offers old favorites such as ``I Feel
Lucky,'' ``Passionate Kisses'' and ``He Thinks He'll Keep Her,''
but most of the recordings are live, not the original studio
versions that first became hits.
 &HT;    Beyond the tried-and-true, ``Party Doll And Other Favorites''
also includes songs from special projects, such as ``10,000 Miles''
_ written for the film ``Fly Away Home'' (1996) _ as well as two
new Carpenter-penned songs. Then there's the title track, ``Party
Doll,'' a Mick Jagger tune which Carpenter regularly performs in
her live shows but had never recorded for an album.
 &HT;    ``It seems to me that, in the last few years, I see artists
who've had maybe one or two records out, then the next record's a
greatest-hits, and I think, `Well, that's not very long of a life
there,''' Carpenter says.
 &HT;    ``I think a lot of times it's more an excuse on the part of the
record company to promote some filler or buy some time for
something else,'' she adds. ``I think in each case you have to be
careful to look at it and see what it really is for. Is it really
something of a retrospective, or is it an excuse for something
else?''
 &HT;    Of course, a retrospective collection also has implications as
far as her career is concerned. The singer/songwriter admits to
having been taken aback when she recently heard the album described
by a journalist as ``a midcareer record.''
 &HT;    ``My reaction was, `It is? I'm still getting started!'''
Carpenter says. ``But then I realized he was absolutely right. I've
been doing this for 10 years, at the very least, with a record
company, and many years prior to that, so I better get current with
myself and realize I'm not just starting out.''
 &HT;    Upon reflection, she decided to flaunt the fact that she's made
it this far, while still keeping oriented toward the future.
 &HT;    ``You know,'' she adds, ``if it's midcareer, then there's a lot
ahead of me, too.''
 &HT;    Given her five Grammy awards, three platinum albums and 12
top-10 singles, Carpenter found choosing the material to be
included on ``Party Doll And Other Favorites'' to be no easy task.
Revisiting a decade's worth of songs, she admits, was a trip down
memory lane, and not always a pleasant one.
 &HT;    ``Did I cringe? Were some cringe-worthy things there?
Absolutely,'' Carpenter says, laughing. ``There were things there
I'd sooner forget, and there were other things that I was just
delighted by that I had forgotten about and that I was proud of.
 &HT;    ``On the one hand, it was really humbling to go back,'' she
says, ``humbling from the standpoint of I sort of was reacquainted
once again with a lot of these projects or opportunities or events
that I'd gotten to participate in, and it was like, `Wow, that was
great.'
 &HT;    ``Then, on the other hand, it was like, `Where did all that time
go?' It was kind of bittersweet, too.''
 &HT;    Those years haven't been spent exclusively in the recording
studio or on tour, either. Carpenter has performed at a
presidential inauguration and for American troops in the Middle
East, as well as put substantial time and money into a variety of
groups promoting environmentalism, literacy and social change.
 &HT;    ``I think you owe it to yourself to do it,'' she says. ``And
that's not a guilt trip, but rather an invitation to get back more
than you give.
 &HT;    ``It's not hard to merge what you love with what's important to
you,'' Carpenter adds. ``What I love, obviously, is playing music,
and what's important to me are the various issues that I align
myself with, and to be able to merge them is simple.''
 &HT;    In the end, she says, she's never been able to come up with an
acceptable excuse for simply sitting on her hands when others need
help.
 &HT;    ``You realize you're in trouble if you think you're too busy or
that you haven't got the time or you're too tired,'' she says,
``because the minute you get out there, you're energized. All the
stuff that makes you feel too busy falls away, and you meet people
who change you.
 &HT;    ``It's not about politics,'' Carpenter concludes. ``It's
humanist _ it has nothing to do with politics, but it has
everything to do with just being a human being.''

LATE CAUTION HELPS JARRETT WIN PEPSI 400
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Winning a Winston Cup championship
requires an abundance of skill and not a small amount of what can
best be described as racing luck.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jarrett is the odds-on favorite to claim his first title
because he has both in abundance this season.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett used that combination to win the Pepsi 400 last night at
Daytona International Speedway. His skill behind the wheel and the
skill of his pit crew got him to the front, and the good fortune of
a caution flag with two laps to go kept him there when the No. 88
Quality Care Ford was dangerously close to running out of gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been close,'' Jarrett said. I think we could
have made it, but they cut it awful close.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with plenty in the tank, Dale Earnhardt and Jeff Burton
might have caught him anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hooked up,'' Earnhardt said. ``If it had stayed green,
I think we could have caught Jarrett. We just ran out of time.''
</P>
<P>
   As it was, the race ended under the yellow flag brought out when
Jeremy Mayfield hit the wall in Turn 4 in the 157th of the 160
laps.
</P>
<P>
   As Mayfield hit the wall, the leaders already were at the
start/finish line. They had to race back around for a full, 2
1/2-mile lap before the caution was in effect. Jarrett remained in
front, followed by Earnhardt and Burton, to clinch his third
victory of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett extended his lead in the points standings to 177 over
Bobby Labonte, who finished fifth, and 229 over Mark Martin, who
was 17th. The standings are unofficial until they are certified by
NASCAR today. Jarrett and crew chief Todd Parrott also showed that
they intend to aggressively pursue the championship, not passively
let it come to them.
</P>
<P>
   A lack of caution periods _ there was only one in the first 147
laps _ turned the race into one of pit strategy. The leaders had to
make one last round of green-flag stops, but couldn't afford to
stay in for long. Would they take four tires or two? Gas only, and
if so one 11-gallon can or two?
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Wallace was in first, followed by Mike Skinner, Jarrett,
Tony Stewart, Bobby Labonte and Earnhardt when the lead pack came
in at the end of the 144th lap.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett was in barely long enough for a splash of gas before
heading out again, this time in first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a stop,'' he said. ``They said they were going to give me
four seconds of fuel, but there's no way I was stopped for four
seconds. It worked out. That got us the lead.''
</P>
<P>
   He was in position to win the race, if he had enough fuel. A
longer stop would have ensured he had enough gas to finish the race
and protect his position in the points standings, but would have
left little chance of seeing the checkered flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows we're here to win races,'' Jarrett said.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt stayed in for two tires, and the seven-time Cup
champion had lost contact with the lead pack when he exited the
pits.
</P>
<P>
   But then Earnhardt got lucky. The second caution of the night
came out for the 148th lap because a gas catch can was loose on the
track. Earnhart was able to close in, as was Burton, who wasn't in
contact with the lead pack when he also took on two tires during
his pit stop.
</P>
<P>
   When the green flag came out with 10 laps to go, Earnhardt was
seventh and Burton 10th. Because they had the only two cars with
fresh rubber, they quickly were able to move up. With three laps to
go, they were second and third, and Burton was waiting for
Earnhardt to make a move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was committed to going with Earnhardt, Burton said. We both
had two tires. The 88 didn't put on tires. If he'd gone off a
cliff, I'd have gone with him.''
</P>
<P>
   He never got the chance. The caution came out, and Jarrett was
able to coast for the final two laps.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he didn't coast until after taking the checkered flag.
He kept his Ford on the flat apron during those last two laps,
trying to conserve every drop of fuel, and ran out on the
backstretch of his victory lap.
</P>
<P>
   He coasted back around to pit road, and needed a push from the
pit crew to get to victory lane.

RANGERS FIZZLE ON THE FOURTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Rangers' stirring, ninth-inning victory
Friday served as this summer's best tease yet.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared the Seattle Mariners would become little more than a
colored speck in the Rangers' rearview mirror as late as the fifth
inning Saturday, but those pesky rascals from the Pacific Northwest
refused to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers gagged on a seven-run, fifth-inning lead Saturday
and then allowed left-hander John Halama to throw the Mariners'
first complete-game shutout since September 1998 during last
night's 6-0 loss.
</P>
<P>
   At least Quality Care Network sponsored a spectacular Fourth of
July fireworks display afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers supplied the smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel really good about this,'' Mariners manager Lou
Piniella said afterward. ``We won against a tough team, and our job
coming in here was to stay in contact with Texas. Naturally, if
they would have swept us, we would have been a ways back. Texas is
a good ballclub, though, and they've been in first place almost
since Day 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's victory and Saturday's fifth-inning lead, though, gave
the Rangers the opportunity to extend their advantage on the
second-place Mariners to nine games in the competitive American
League West.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we wanted to do, but it didn't happen that way,''
Rangers second baseman Mark McLemore said. ``They came out
swinging, and we faced some tough pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Mariners trail by only five games as the Rangers open a
six-game road trip tonight in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a long season to go,'' Rangers catcher Ivan
Rodriguez said. ``We've still got 80 games left.''
</P>
<P>
   Halama, whom the Mariners acquired with right-hander Freddy
Garcia and infielder Carlos Guillen in the July 31, 1998, trade
that sent left-hander Randy Johnson to the Astros, silenced his
opponents on this evening.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers managed only six hits, and designated hitter Rafael
Palmeiro produced the only one worth extra bases with his two-out,
ninth-inning double. The Rangers loaded the bases during their
final at-bat, but Halama (7-2) preserved the shutout and improved
to 5-0 with a 2.91 earned-run average in eight starts since joining
the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a dose of our own medicine tonight,'' Rangers manager
Johnny Oates said. ``He made a lot of quality pitches. He really
didn't give us anything to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers right-hander Morgan (9-6) would not fare as well.
</P>
<P>
   Mariners shortstop Alex Rodriguez and designated hitter Edgar
Martinez supplied Halama with all the run support the left-hander
would need during their four-run first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman David Bell scored on Rodriguez's one-out single,
and Martinez cleared the bases one pitch later with a three-run
homer on a sinking, two-seam fastball from Morgan that neither sank
nor jammed the right-handed hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got it up, and Edgar did what he's supposed to do with
it,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   That pretty much ended any chance of the Rangers burying the
Mariners this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played with an awful lot of intensity,'' Seattle's
Rodriguez said. ``It was a huge night for us. Anytime you can get a
two-game swing against somebody in your own division, it's a big
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers shrugged it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played pretty decent in the first half, but we need to get
better in the second half,'' Palmeiro said. ``I think we will.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers right-hander Jeff Zimmerman agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very evenly balanced division, and there are a lot
of great offensive teams,'' Zimmerman said. ``We still have what it
takes to win this division.''

RANGERS GET MORE BANG FOR LESS BUCKS WITH PALMEIRO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Two big-name free agents went head-to-head
last week in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   The $80 million guy, limping with a bad ankle, went 0-for-8 with
five strikeouts. The $45 million guy, limping with a bad knee, went
9-for-13 with a home run, four runs scored and six runs batted in.
His team won all three games and is in first place, and he has yet
to lead a mutiny against his manager.
</P>
<P>
   Score it a clear knockout for Rafael Palmeiro over Mo Vaughn and
further indication the Rangers might have landed a bargain when
they signed Palmeiro to a five-year, $45 million contract in the
off-season.
</P>
<P>
   There have also been clear indications, halfway through the 1999
season, that Palmeiro is not the same hitter, or player, the
Rangers let get away five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   When Palmeiro left the Rangers to sign with Baltimore after the
1993 season, he was still in transition as a hitter, trying to go
from a high-average guy who could compete for a batting title to a
middle-of-the-lineup, home run and RBI guy.
</P>
<P>
   He was also a player who still let his emotions get to him, as
he did the night the Rangers announced they had signed Will Clark
to play first base when both Clark and Palmeiro were free agents.
</P>
<P>
   The first sign of a changed man came in the off-season when
Palmeiro took control of his contract situation and got something
done quickly with the Rangers. Then he took the field and showed
the transition as a hitter is complete.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the numbers show he might be the best all-around hitter
going in the American League right now.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro went into Saturday's game hitting .362 with 20 home
runs and 70 RBI, which put him in the AL top 10 in all three
categories. His .632 slugging percentage led the league, and his
.439 on-base percentage was fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far everything has gone better than expected,'' said
Palmeiro, who stands an excellent chance of being selected to the
American League All-Star team on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Palmeiro's value goes far beyond mathematics. Rangers
manager Johnny Oates was reminded of that during the final game
against the Anaheim Angels, an 18-4 victory for the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took him out that game in the sixth inning and I look up,
he's still on the bench, cheering for his teammates,'' Oates said.
``I gave him the opportunity to shower early because we were
leaving right after the game and he said, no, I want to stay here
with these guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys who were in there, who don't play much, don't think
they don't appreciate Raffy sitting there on the top step cheering
them on.''
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Rusty Greer sees something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides all the offense, he's shown that he goes out there
every day and plays in pain,'' Greer said. ``That's part of
leadership. There were times he could have taken days off but he
didn't, even with the knee hurting. That goes a long way with your
teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro has come a long way in that regard. The toughness, the
leadership and the hot start have helped dispel some ``myths''
about Palmeiro. He has heard them before: that he was not a leader,
that he was selfish, he was only concerned about his own numbers
and didn't care about the rest of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where that all got started,'' Palmeiro said,
shaking his head. ``It's unfair. That's not what I'm about. But you
can't please everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reporters started saying the only thing I care about is my
numbers, but I want you to name me one player in baseball who
doesn't think about his numbers. Everybody does to some degree. But
I think the more people watch me play, the more they understand who
I am and what I'm about.''
</P>
<P>
   Such myths _ fair or not _ cost Palmeiro money. Over the past
five years, Vaughn has hit .319 with 184 home runs and 562 RBI;
Palmeiro has hit .292 with 182 homers and 553 RBI. Palmeiro, a
two-time Gold Glove winner, is a much better defensive player and
clearly seems in better shape.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Vaughn was the one who got the much bigger contract during
the off-season because of his perceived clubhouse presence. The
Angels thought that would make a difference. Instead, Vaughn was
reported as the leader of a rebellious group of Angels players that
went complaining to general manager Bill Bavasi about manager Terry
Collins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing with Raffy is he doesn't try to be somebody else,''
Rangers general manager Doug Melvin said. ``He's a quiet leader,
but the players have a lot of respect for him. Johnny's known him
for a long time, he managed him in Baltimore, and he knew what kind
of guy he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn laments that his ankle injury has limited his production
and made for a frustrating season. Vaughn, who spent two weeks on
the disabled list in April, entered Saturday's Angels game hitting
.277 with 16 homers and 51 RBI. His team is in last place in the AL
West.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not out there in the fray,'' Vaughn said. ``That's what
bothers me. No one here has ever seen me play at full strength. I'm
a different person. I'm a different player.''
</P>
<P>
   But Palmeiro's return to Texas, as well as it has gone, has not
been without setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro signed with the Rangers expecting to bat third and play
first base. Instead, Oates decided to bat him fifth, and two
operations on his right knee have limited him mostly to the role of
designated hitter duty.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't let either affect his performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past it might have bothered me,'' Palmeiro admitted.
``But not now. The thing about DH, I have to accept it no matter
what because the knee hasn't responded as well as I would have
liked. The fifth position, I knew it wouldn't be a problem. My job
is to produce runs, and in this lineup, third, fourth, fifth or
even sixth, it's an RBI position.''
</P>
<P>
   The RBI have come. So has the average, the home runs and the
leadership, all combining to help push the Rangers into first base
in the American League. With each passing day it's becoming more
obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro is everything the Angels ever expected from Vaughn.

INDIANS FANS JUST EXERCISING THEIR RIGHT TO BE WRONG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget Manny Ramirez, his bucket head and his bucket full of
RBI.
</P>
<P>
   The American League All-Star team starts with two players: the
best player in the known universe and the best run-producer in
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have Ken Griffey Jr. and Juan Gonzalez on the team,
then you get around to selecting Ramirez, Ivan Rodriguez, Roberto
Alomar and one really, really good shortstop to be named later.
</P>
<P>
   Blame Cleveland that it's not being that way. Somehow sniffing
the fumes from century-old factories along the Cuyahoga River have
left Indians fans with the delusion that not only Ramirez and
Alomar should be starting the All-Star Game but Travis Fryman and
Wil Cordero as well.
</P>
<P>
   So, urged on by Indians management, they have denied themselves
the other pleasures of their fair city _ like sunbathing along Lake
Erie and scarfing down pirogies in the Slavic Village _ and spent
their time punching All-Star ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Good for them.
</P>
<P>
   They were given the vote and they used it _ perhaps somewhat
irrationally at times, but so what?
</P>
<P>
   The best way to pick the starting lineups for the All-Star Game
is by letting the fans do it. The obvious danger is that highly
deserving players will be snubbed by overzealous fans in certain
cities, and it's a sure bet that nobody from the Montreal Expos
will be elected anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   But the worse thing that could come from the Gonzalez debacle is
a move to take away the vote from the fans. Refine the process,
yes. Give it to somebody else, no.
</P>
<P>
   The usual knee-jerk reaction in these cases is for the players
to say they should do the voting, because they know better than
anybody who deserves to be an All-Star.
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe that for a second.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, ``USA Today'' paid me to poll the players on
their All-Star selections, and the players were no more discerning
than your average laid-off Cleveland steel worker. The players
round up the usual suspects faster than anybody with no clear idea
who's truly deserving.
</P>
<P>
   A panel of experts? How about the Society of American Baseball
Research, a group that spends much of their collective waking hours
studying the national pastime. SABR even has its headquarters in
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Well, ``Baseball Weekly'' asked SABR to vote for the top 100
players of the century and the 800-plus electorate proceeded to
vote Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Ted Williams as the top three
players.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, SABR is not the most ethnically diverse group going.
Ruth, yes. Gehrig and Williams over Hank Aaron and Willie Mays? No.
</P>
<P>
   The most vital function of All-Star voting is it keeps fans
connected to the game. Given that the average baseball player could
buy his own Cleveland steel mill, that's becoming more and more
difficult to do.
</P>
<P>
   Especially since baseball is an industry that prides itself on
alienating customers: what with strikes, charter seat licenses,
prohibitive concession stands and increasingly lopsided
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Severing fans from the All-Star selection process would only be
one more blow.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez should be disappointed by his meager All-Star vote
totals. Sometimes there is no accounting for taste, which is why
you have Fox television, the new Comiskey Park, Uma Thurman playing
Emma Peel and a second Austin Powers movie.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes you have to endure what's infernally painful for a
process that _ in the long run _ is good for the game.

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science
Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, July 6:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DOLPHIN-VIOLENCE (Undated) _ The image of the peaceful,
playful dolphins is now being destroyed. Following a trail of
bloody clues, researchers have discovered that dolphins are far
from the happy, peaceful creatures humans think they know. Growing
evidence shows that the big animals are killing fellow mammals in
droves, wielding their beaks as clubs and slashing away with rows
of sharp teeth. Dolphins have been found to bludgeon porpoises to
death by the hundreds. Unlike most animal killers, which eat their
prey, dolphins seem to have murderous urges unrelated to the need
for food. By William J. Broad. (2200 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo and graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SLEEP-PARALYSIS (Tokyo) _ Sleep paralysis, a disorder
involving a perceived evil in bed or a hurtling through a long
tunnel, is the result of a disconnect between brain and body as a
person is on the fringe of sleep. It is turning out to be
increasingly common, affecting nearly half of all people at least
once. Moreover, a growing number of scholars believe that sleep
paralysis may help explain many ancient reports of attacks by
witches and modern claims of abduction by space aliens. By Nicholas
D. Kristof. (1850 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ORPHAN-PLANETS (Washington) _ Several Earth-like planets,
created billions of years ago during the formation of our solar
system, may be wandering in deep space harboring conditions that
could sustain some form of life, according to a new theory proposed
by a prominent planetary scientist. By Warren E. Leary. (1000
words)
</P>
<P>
   DERTOUZOS-FUTURE (Undated) _ In the 1970s, Dr. Michael L.
Dertouzos forecast that one-third of all American homes would soon
have personal computers. In 1980, he announced the coming of a
worldwide Internet culture. He looks backward and forward in a
conversation. In Q&AMP;A format. By Claudia H. Dreifus. (1500 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-LIGHTHOUSE-MOVE (Undated) _ On the move of the Cape Hatteras
Lighthouse, now under way. By Cornelia Dean. (300 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ News and notes on science: Items on
folding proteins, a newly discovered species of deer in Myanmar and
the Cassini's second flyby of Venus. By Henry Founrtain. (700
words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-COMPOUNDED-DRUGS (Undated) _ Although that practice of
compounding, where a pharmacist mixes and measures ingredients to
fill capsules, has largely given way to ready-made products, it is
still used to prepare individual prescriptions for people who need
something not commercially available. But compounding seemed to
take on a new meaning last week, when advocates for people with
hepatitis C announced that a pharmacy could save customers a lot of
money _ as much as $900 a month _ on an expensive medication by
compounding it. The announcement seemed to take the FDA by
surprise, coming as it is trying to develop new rules to keep
compounding within certain limits. Officials say they are trying to
keep compounding, meant to make small amounts of medicine for
individual patients, from crossing the line to large-scale
manufacturing. In addition, some compounded medicines are
essentially new drugs that have not been proved or tested. By

   SCI-DOLPHIN-VIOLENCE (Undated) _ The image of the peaceful,
playful dolphins is now being destroyed. Following a trail of
bloody clues, researchers have discovered that dolphins are far
from the happy, peaceful creatures humans think they know. Growing
evidence shows that the big animals are killing fellow mammals in
droves, wielding their beaks as clubs and slashing away with rows
of sharp teeth. Dolphins have been found to bludgeon porpoises to
death by the hundreds. Unlike most animal killers, which eat their
prey, dolphins seem to have murderous urges unrelated to the need
for food. By William J. Broad. (2200 words)

<P>
   With photo and graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SLEEP-PARALYSIS (Tokyo) _ Sleep paralysis, a disorder
involving a perceived evil in bed or a hurtling through a long
tunnel, is the result of a disconnect between brain and body as a
person is on the fringe of sleep. It is turning out to be
increasingly common, affecting nearly half of all people at least
once. Moreover, a growing number of scholars believe that sleep
paralysis may help explain many ancient reports of attacks by
witches and modern claims of abduction by space aliens. By Nicholas
D. Kristof. (1850 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ORPHAN-PLANETS (Washington) _ Several Earth-like planets,
created billions of years ago during the formation of our solar
system, may be wandering in deep space harboring conditions that
could sustain some form of life, according to a new theory proposed
by a prominent planetary scientist. By Warren E. Leary. (1000

   DERTOUZOS-FUTURE (Undated) _ In the 1970s, Dr. Michael L.
Dertouzos forecast that one-third of all American homes would soon
have personal computers. In 1980, he announced the coming of a
worldwide Internet culture. He looks backward and forward in a

   SCI-COMPOUNDED-DRUGS (Undated) _ Although that practice of

something not commercially available. But compounding seemed to
take on a new meaning last week, when advocates for people with

   LANGUAGE _ WASHINGTON _ The same biological force that
scientists believe drove the evolution of life could account for
the development of complex languages in humans, two Princeton
University scientists suggested Monday. A family that developed a
word for ``leopard'' would be more likely to survive - and pass the
word on to future generations - than a family that had not.

MANY SITES FAILURES AT USABILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HOYE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Do you know Jakob Nielsen? &QL; 
Probably not. But you should, especially if you ever plan to make
money from a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The Northern California resident has been called one of the
Web's 10 most influential people, a group that also includes the
likes of America Online's Steve Case, Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com and
William Kennard, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen is the guy the ``New York Times'' once dubbed the ``guru
of Web page usability,'' a man for whom Web design is not a matter
of taste or aesthetics _ it's a matter of science.`
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen, who was in Phoenix to address an annual meeting of Web
usability experts from around the country, has made a career out of
studying what makes a Web site work and what makes a site fail.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing the difference between the two is crucial for anyone
venturing into the largely uncharted seas of e-commerce, or buying
and selling online.
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce has quickly gone from being an experiment involving a
few companies to a requirement for any business that wants to
succeed. International Data Corp. recently estimated that online
spending will hit $1 trillion by 2003. Sales people already know
that success means outselling their company's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Despite signs that e-commerce is booming, Nielsen says the vast
majority of business-related Web sites are failures at usability.
Generally, that means average users find it too difficult to
navigate the sites, find the products or information they want and
spend money.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Web, the power rests with he or she who clicks the
mouse,'' Nielsen said during an interview last week. ``If (a Web
site) is difficult to use or you can't find anything, what's the
customer's reaction? It's to go someplace else. You lose your
chance at the next generation economy if it's not easy to use your
site.''
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen said the problem affects Web sites operated by companies
of all sizes. Having cash to spend on fancy designs doesn't seem to
matter.
</P>
<P>
   The most frequent mistakes he finds include:
</P>
<P>
   - Using the latest in Web technology despite the fact that it
does nothing to enhance the usability of the site.
</P>
<P>
   - Depending on complex URLs, or Web-page addresses, that include
strings of numbers and symbols instead of simple words that users
can remember.
</P>
<P>
   - Outdated content that shows users nobody is minding the online
store.
</P>
<P>
   - Opening new browser windows when the user clicks on a link,
something Nielsen equates with a vacuum cleaner salesman who begins
a visit by dumping an ashtray on your carpet.
</P>
<P>
   - Slow servers and pages that take too long to download.
</P>
<P>
   Fixing problem Web sites, he says, has to be done on an
individual basis. No single format can work for every online
business. But basic steps all follow the same thread.
</P>
<P>
   Design for the user, not the guys in marketing or the boss
upstairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason why some sites get famous, like Amazon.com, is that
they make usability the primary focus. What makes it easy for
people to buy a book or CD?'' Nielsen said. ``They are not
geniuses. I've noticed them doing stupid things. But if they make a
mistake, they fix it immediately. They know what works and what
doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   While designing or redesigning a Web site, Nielsen urges that
the ``feel'' of the site needs to be given more importance than the
``look.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Feeling dominates over the look,'' he says. ``It's freedom to
navigate and move around. Do the users feel empowered? Or are they
sluggish, like they are swimming in a sea of oil? Do they feel lost
and abandoned?''
</P>
<P>
   One quick way to test the feeling of your site: Find out if
users know what's going to happen when they click on a link or
button. If they do, that's good. Your site is open and predictable.
If the user gets surprised and says, ``Oops!'' there's work to be
done.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen said he has developed three main rules to follow in
determining what works on a Web site and what doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   They are:
</P>
<P>
   - Test your site with representative customers, not the guy in
the next cubicle who already knows all there is to know about your
company.
</P>
<P>
   - While testing your site, have the representative customers do
real tasks or solve real problems. If it's an airline site, have
them try to book a flight.
</P>
<P>
   - Shut up. Let the users do the talking. If they keep clicking
the wrong buttons, change the buttons. ``If the customer clicks on
the wrong button,'' he says, ``it's not because they are stupid,
it's because your design is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Want to know more? Nielsen runs his own Web site, which is
packed with information and links to related studies and Web sites.
He also writes a regular column. Find it all at www.useit.com. &QL;

<P>
   If you're in the market for a new computer, check out the July
issue of ``PC'' magazine. Beginning on page 183, you'll find the
results from the magazine's 12th annual Readers' Choice survey for
service and reliability.
</P>
<P>
   In grading desktop computers, Dell, IBM and Quantex were given
the highest mark, an A rating. In the B category were Apple,
Hewlett-Packard, Micron and Sony. The largest group, C, included
AT&AMP;T, Comp-USA, Digital, Gateway, NEC, Toshiba, Zenith Data
Systems, ZEOS and machines locally built.
</P>
<P>
   The D group included AST, Compaq and MidWest Micro. Rounding out
the desktop rating list were Acer and Packard Bell in the E group.
</P>
<P>
   As for notebook computers, IBM and Sony were rated A, Compaq,
Dell, Gateway, Micron and Toshiba earned a B rating, Acer, Apple,
Digital, Fujitsu, Hewlett-Packard, Hitachi and NEC completed the C
category, Texas Instruments and WinBook were given D ratings and
AST got the only E rating.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the computer makers might complain about their rankings.
But it's interesting to note that, for the most part, the rankings
have remained fairly constant for most of the vendors since 1993,
according to a chart published with the magazine story.
</P>
<P>
   In the desktop category, for example, Dell has earned A marks
each time the survey was taken, except for a single B rating it
received in 1995. Packard Bell, meanwhile, has earned a steady
stream of D and E ratings,except for a single C rating in 1995. &QL;

EARTH MAY HAVE LONG-LOST SISTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(HLW) 
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Several Earth-like planets, created billions of
years ago during the formation of our solar system, may be
wandering in deep space harboring conditions that could sustain
some form of life, according to a new theory proposed by a
prominent planetary scientist.
</P>
<P>
   These orphan worlds, ejected from the solar system by
gravitational forces during its tumultuous beginnings, may have
retained atmospheres rich in molecular hydrogen even as they were
flung into the dark void of interstellar space, said Dr. David J.
Stevenson, a professor of planetary science at the California
Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   The rogue planets, instead of being cold, icy masses meandering
among the stars as some astronomers have believed, could be warm
bodies with dense, insulating atmospheres that trap enough volcanic
heat to sustain water oceans and some types of simple life forms,
he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of Earth-sized bodies being ejected when the solar
system formed is not new,'' Stevenson said, ``But instead of being
uninteresting frozen balls of barren matter, I am proposing that
they could have acquired a dense atmosphere and maintained it to
act as an insulating blanket to sustain Earth-like temperatures in
the absence of sunlight.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that life could exist in such seemingly inhospitable
conditions has been bolstered in recent years by the discovery of a
variety of unusual creatures living in lightless, sulfurous
environments at the ocean floor, warmed by heat from undersea
vents. These discoveries have fueled speculation that life might
exist elsewhere in the universe, though possibly in forms that
would seem strange to ordinary humans.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson described his theories in the current issue of the
journal Nature. Stevenson said that if planetary systems around
other stars formed in similar ways, then there could be billions of
such interstellar planets flung into space. If life can develop and
be sustained without sunlight on these planets, he wrote, ``it is
conceivable that these are the most common sites of life in the
universe.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson said his idea of dark, life-sustaining planets moving
among the stars is drawn from linking several accepted concepts of
planetary theory and his own calculations. ``This is just an idea,
but it comes together plausibly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jack J. Lissauer, a specialist in planet formation at the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Ames Research
Center in California, said Stevenson's idea is an ``interesting''
one that extends earlier work by numerous other scientists. ``David
Stevenson put all these parts together and has raised the
possibility of something that is really far out, but not
ridiculous,'' he said, ``It makes some sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alan P. Boss, a solar system specialist at the Carnegie
Institution of Washington's Department of Terrestrial Magnetism,
said the new theory ``is a logical extension of what people have
proposed for a long time about the early solar system.''
</P>
<P>
   When the solar system was formed about 4.5 billion years ago
from primal gases and dust coming together, Boss said, the process
produced multiple cores that tried to become planets near the
orbits of Jupiter and Saturn. Some of these bodies became parts of
the giant planets when drawn in by their gravity, he said, while
others passed nearby and were flung away in a slingshot effect that
propelled them out of the solar system.
</P>
<P>
   This process was responsible for knocking about a trillion small
bodies out of the infant solar system, causing them to form a giant
sphere of debris in deep space that surrounds the sun and its
planets. This debris, called the Oort cloud, is believed to be the
source of most comets that enter the solar system.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Oort cloud was formed by many small bodies being
knocked out of the solar system, it is not a great leap to imagine
losing a few Earth-sized bodies the same way,'' Boss said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Stevenson, there were about a half-dozen Earth-like
planets in Jupiter-crossing orbits in the early days of the solar
system. Planets with masses one-half to 2-and-a-half times that of
the Earth could gather and retain some of the dense hydrogen gas
that permeated the solar system at the time. This gas could
collapse to the surface of the planet under enough pressure to
become an opaque, heat-retaining blanket, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Without sunlight to provide energy, the planets' heat would come
from volcanic activity and natural radioactive elements. Because of
the thick hydrogen atmosphere, exerting pressures 100 to 1,000
times greater than that at sea level on Earth, temperatures on the
dark planets could reach more than 60 degrees Fahrenheit, Stevenson
said.
</P>
<P>
   The surface of such a planet would be almost totally dark, he
said, except for the occasional illumination of lightning or a
volcanic eruption, and the sky would be covered with layers of
clouds made up of methane, ammonia and perhaps water.
</P>
<P>
   Even under these conditions, he said, water, temperature
variations and other factors might foster life and sustain it.
However, because available energy is thousands of times less than
that found on Earth, he said, any life that developed there would
likely be very simple and scarce.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson said interstellar planets produced during the
formation of our solar system would be hundreds of trillion of
miles away by now. Similar planets created by other star systems
billions of years ago could be closer to Earth and its neighbor
planets than those created by our solar system, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because these planets are so dark and give off relatively little
energy, they cannot be seen with present technology, he said. The
best hope of demonstrating the existence of interstellar planets,
scientists said, would be a programmed search of the sky for
occultations, when a body passes between the Earth and a star,
causing the starlight to flicker or fade.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harold F. Levison, an astronomer with the Southwest Research
Institute in Boulder, Colo., said a good place to look might be the
Oort cloud, where one or more of these tossed-off planets might be
trapped with other debris of solar system formation. Although this
area is far away _ equal to 100,000 times the distance from the
Earth to the sun _ it's closer than looking toward nearby stars, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may be more easy to find in the Oort cloud,'' Levison
said, ``But it still will be hard to find something Earth-sized
that far out.''

   When the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse was commissioned in 1870, it
was about 1,500 feet from the sea. By this year, the sea had crept
almost to its base. Now it is being moved inland, a decision that
did not come easily.
</P>
<P>
   Some nearby residents suggested the Corps of Engineers wall off
the lighthouse and let the sea move in around it. But geologists
said the structure's foundation was so shallow the lighthouse would
tip over if it lost its island base. Also, it was resting on heavy
pine beams that last for decades _ but only as long as they are
under fresh water, below the island's water table. Otherwise they
are subject to rot or attack by marine organisms.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of a move suggested building rock piers to extend into
the surf and trap sand in front of the lighthouse, widening its
protective beach. But regulations bar such armor because it can
cause erosion of neighboring beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Still others felt it would be better to let the beloved
lighthouse fall to the ocean than to subject it to the indignity of
being hoisted up on jacks and moved.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, advocates of the move prevailed. Though moving a
208-foot, 128-year-old lighthouse looks daunting, they said, the
technology is off the shelf; it works more or less like the track
system that moves the space shuttle from its assembly building to
the launching pad.
</P>
<P>
   But because the lighthouse will travel over ground that is not
level to a site six feet higher than its original home, engineers
have installed a system of hydraulic jacks to keep it level.
Instruments mounted on the structure allow engineers to monitor its
position precisely.
</P>
<P>
   And, if all goes well, by August there will once again be at
least 1,500 feet of sand and scrub pine between the lighthouse and
the waves.

Minister Nawaz Sharif is likely to find it difficult to deliver on
his assurance to the Americans that he will seek the withdraw of
Pakistani-backed forces from the Indian side of the cease-fire line
in the disputed territory of Kashmir. Sharif's sudden decision to
call on the president on Sunday and his commitment to take
``concrete steps'' to restore the cease-fire line were seen here,
not as a breakthrough that would help end a limited, undeclared war

evidence shows that the big animals are killing fellow mammals in
droves, wielding their beaks as clubs and slashing away with rows
of sharp teeth. Dolphins have been found to bludgeon porpoises to
death by the hundreds. Unlike most animal killers, which eat their
prey, dolphins seem to have murderous urges unrelated to the need
for food. By William J. Broad. (2200 words)

   The last time I hopped around in an exercise class, George Bush
was in the White House and Spandex ruled.
</P>
<P>
   These exercise classes _ aerobics, step, jazz aerobics, jazz
step, jazz aerobics step _ were excruciatingly repetitive and
boring. I abandoned them and their Paula Abdul music mixes with
glee when I met my (Stair)master and, on alternate days, took to
the streets running.
</P>
<P>
   So it was with some trepidation, understandably, that I prepared
to re-enter the realm of group sweat. I settled on kickboxing.
Exercise, and fun, with a purpose: self-defense. I could up my
cardio and down my assailants at the same time.

   U.S. Martial Arts and Fitness in Bloomfield, N.J., seemed a good
place to start. Dave Vanderhoff, co-owner, chief kickboxing
instructor and black belt, believes in kickboxing: for
self-defense, for losing pounds and inches and for just plain fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``You keep your hands up and you're kicking,'' he said. ``It's
constant motion.''
</P>
<P>
   Kickboxing is a mix of tae kwon do, the Korean system of
self-defense that concentrates on kicking; karate, the Japanese
discipline that focuses on hand motions and postures; and Marquess
of Queensberry boxing with a touch of good old American aerobics.
It all cooks up to a sort of martial arts lite.
</P>
<P>
   Kickboxing originated in Thailand (muay Thai), and is rapidly
becoming popular in the United States, mainly on the East and West
Coasts. In fact, the owners of U.S. Martial Arts have recently
opened a branch in Wayne, N.J., called Can-Do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids make up most of the traditional martial arts classes
these days,'' Vanderhoff said of karate and tae kwon do. ``Most
adults don't have time to commit three years to achieving a belt.''
</P>
<P>
   Though not a kid anymore and certainly not an adult with time on
my hands, off I went, ready to kick in the name of reportage.
</P>
<P>
   At 9 on a Sunday morning (ouch from the get-go) the big, bright
kickboxing room was already filled with 25 lean, mean female
machines in their 20s and 30s as well as a smattering of
fridge-hugging mamas crowding their late 40s. They wore sweats,
clean-soled sneakers or just socks and, like me, less and less as
the hourlong class continued, stripping down to jogging bra and
shorts. There were also two men, one of whom left the floor,
panting, only 25 minutes into the class to lie down and recuperate
in the back.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what felled him: the constant one, two, three, kick,
punch, kick, kick, kick action and the relentless, hard-driving
repetitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very fast-paced,'' Vanderhoff said. He did not
exaggerate.
</P>
<P>
   It helps to be in fairly good shape, if not in fighting form.
Kickboxers-to-be are free to work out at their own pace, learning
the movements and improving as they go along, as they would in any
martial arts or exercise class. It is more fun, of course, to keep
up with the instructor. (And even to try to surpass him.)
</P>
<P>
   The preferred music mix is 140 to 160 beats per minute,
Vanderhoff says. He enjoys power mix CD's, especially ``Aerobics
Power Mix 27,'' with its thumpy, club music from Umboza, Dynamic
Bass, Promise, 2 Unlimited, Angelina, Marmalade, Undercover,
Bronski and Mission. No Paula Abdul within hearing range this time
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want the music to lull at all,'' he said. Trust me,
it didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Rena Lampe, an instructor complete with headset microphone to
issue her commands, began sweating (and this was sweating, beyond
mere perspiring and glowing) a few minutes into her class. You know
you're in for it when the leader is so hard she's hard on herself,
too.
</P>
<P>
   The action over all is aerobics-esque, '80s-ish even. It's
particularly apparent with the dance mixes and the hooting and
hollering deep into the workout, but with the Asian ``hi-YAH!''
instead of the American ``woo-HOO!'' Unless you are in a match
against an opponent (think Jean-Claude Van Damme's movie
``Kickboxer''), kickboxers polish their skills by competing with
themselves, kicking and punching the air.
</P>
<P>
   The last 10 minutes of class were devoted to sit-ups _ dozens
and dozens of them _ and thigh and glute work, the toning chaser
after the big sweat, the gravy on this tough meat-and-potatoes
workout. The word on the mat is that the more you sweat, the better
the workout. And sweat you do.
</P>
<P>
   You feel as if something, something good but painful, is
happening. Rena instructed us to ``take it easy today and take a
short walk tomorrow.'' Though I ignored her advice, meeting my
Master the next morning, my body is on fire until Tuesday morning,
when I go back for more.
</P>
<P>
   I  &UR; feel  &LR; tough. I love it!
</P>
<P>
   Miles, my 5-year-old son, watched the classes. ``You're cool,
Mommy,'' he said approvingly.
</P>
<P>
   I  &UR; feel  &LR; cool. Invincible.
</P>
<P>
   And just as soon as my arms and back stop aching, I'll be ready
to disable any assailant (if he's unarmed, under 5 foot 10 and
weighs less than 200 pounds). Then I'll challenge him to a sit-ups
contest. I know I'll win.

SCIENTISTS OFFER EXPLANATION FOR ALIEN ABDUCTIONS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada, Japan, China, Newfoundland, West Indies)   By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ About once a week, Jean-Christophe Terrillon wakes up
and senses the presence of a threatening, evil being beside his
bed. Terror ripples through him, and he tries to move or call out.
</P>
<P>
   But he is paralyzed, unable to raise an arm or make a sound. His
ears ring, a weight presses down on his chest, and he has to
struggle for breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel an intense pressure in my head, as if it's going to
explode,'' said Terrillon, a Canadian physicist doing research in
Japan. Sometimes he finds himself transported upward and looking
down on his body, or else sent hurtling through a long tunnel, and
these episodes are terrifying even for a scientist like him who
does not believe that evil spirits go around haunting people.
</P>
<P>
   Called sleep paralysis, this disorder _ the result of a
disconnect between brain and body as a person is on the fringe of
sleep _ is turning out to be increasingly common, affecting nearly
half of all people at least once. Moreover, a growing number of
scholars believe that sleep paralysis may help explain many ancient
reports of attacks by witches and modern claims of abduction by
space aliens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it can explain claims of witchcraft and alien
abduction,'' said Kazuhiko Fukuda, a psychologist at Fukushima
University in Japan and a leading expert on sleep paralysis.
Research in Japan has had a headstart because sleep paralysis is
well-known to most Japanese, who call it kanashibari, while it is
little-known and less studied in the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a framework for it, but in North America there's no
concept for people to understand what has happened to them,''
Fukuda said. ``So if Americans have the experience and if they have
heard of alien abductions, then they may think, `Aha, it's alien
abduction!'''
</P>
<P>
   Sleep paralysis was once thought to be very rare. But recent
studies in Canada, Japan, China and the United States have
suggested that it may strike at least 40 percent or 50 percent of
all people at least once, and a study in Newfoundland, Canada,
found that more than 60 percent had experienced it.
</P>
<P>
   There, as in Japan, people have a name for the condition and
some scholars believe that people are therefore more likely to
identify it when it happens to them. In Newfoundland, it is called
``old hag'' because it is associated with visions of an old witch
sitting on the chest of a paralyzed sleeper, sometimes throttling
the neck with her hands.
</P>
<P>
   Sleep paralysis seems to have been described since ancient
times, and an episode appears in ``Moby Dick'' and perhaps also in
the 18th century Henry Fuseli painting, ``The Nightmare,'' which
shows a goblin sitting on the stomach of a sleeping woman. What is
striking is that although the symptoms of sleep paralysis are
generally very similar, the images in the hallucinations and the
interpretation of them seem to vary.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans seem to have interpreted ancient sleep paralysis as
assaults or abductions by witches taking them off for a forcible
ride on a broomstick. Chinese called it ``gui ya,'' or ghost
pressure, and believed that a ghost sat on and assaulted sleepers.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Indies, sleep paralysis was called ``kokma'' and
meant a ghost baby who jumped on the sleeper's chest and attacked
the throat. In old Japan, it sometimes seems to have been
interpreted as a giant devil whose foot came down on the sleeper's
chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will draw on the most plausible account in their
repertoire to explain their experience,'' said Al Cheyne, an
associate professor of psychology at the University of Waterloo in
Canada. ``Trolls or witches no longer constitute plausible
interpretations of these hallucinations. The notion of aliens from
outer space is more contemporary and somewhat more plausible to the
modern mind. So a flight on a broomstick is replaced by a
teleportation to a waiting spaceship.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheyne said that in a survey he had worked on involving more
than 2,000 people identified as experiencing sleep paralysis,
hundreds described experiences similar to alien abduction.
</P>
<P>
   ``A sensed presence, vague gibberish spoken in one's ear,
shadowy creatures moving about the room, a strange immobility, a
crushing pressure and painful sensations in various parts of the
body _ these are compatible not just with an assault by a primitive
demon but also with probing by alien experimenters,'' Cheyne said.
``And the sensations of floating and flying account for the reports
of levitation and transport to alien vessels.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years there has been a huge increase in the number of
people who insist that they have been kidnapped by alien creatures
from outer space, perhaps subjected to medical experiments and then
released again. These claims have been a bit of a scientific
puzzle, because they strike most people as utterly wacky and yet
they are relatively widespread. One well-publicized (and widely
criticized) Roper Poll published in 1992 suggested that nearly four
million American reported experiences akin to alien abduction.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, one study found that these people were no more
fantasy-prone than the general population and had slightly higher
intelligence. Many shun publicity and show signs of feeling
traumatized and humiliated.
</P>
<P>
   Several scholars have found that people are more likely to
report alien abductions when they have been exposed to movies or
books about the idea. Simon Sherwood, a researcher on sleep
paralysis in England, said that in one case study he gathered, a
regular sufferer of sleep paralysis watched an alien film and then
had a hallucination of ``little blue aliens'' inserting a metal
probe into his forehead.
</P>
<P>
   The growing professional literature on sleep paralysis has often
mentioned the parallels with reports of alien abductions. Still,
many scholars are reluctant to research the connection for fear of
tainting their reputations. Others say that a connection is
plausible but unproved.
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Tomoka Takeuchi, a Japanese expert on sleep paralysis who is now
conducting research at Brock University in Ontario, Canada, said
that a connection might eventually be demonstrated scientifically
but added: ``I hesitate to speculate too much.''
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Those who believe in alien abductions deny that sleep paralysis
could be behind it all. John E. Mack, a Harvard University Medical
School professor who is the most prominent defender of the
possibility of abductions, argues that sleep paralysis simply does
not fit the evidence. He notes that at least a few abduction
reports come from remote places where people are not exposed to
movies or tales of UFO's, and that many happen in daylight and
involve people who seem to have been awake and alert.
</P>
<P>
   Other defenders of abduction theories say aliens may be clever
enough to use sleep paralysis in their kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
   Sleep paralysis researchers say that as many as 60 percent of
intense abduction experiences were linked to sleep, and some of the
reported symptoms _ noises, smells, paralysis, levitation, terror,
images of frightening intruders _ are very similar to those of
sleep paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   Still, sleep paralysis cannot be a full explanation because some
reports of alien abduction do not involve sleep. Leonard S. Newman,
a psychologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago who has
studied alien abductions, argues that they are false memories _ in
some cases triggered by sleep paralysis but at other times by day
dreams or fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``People, especially when they are hypnotized, can easily weave
together images, dreams, fantasies and things that they might just
have heard or read about into elaborate pseudo-memories that they
are confident are real,'' Newman said in an e-mail interview.
</P>
<P>
   So what is sleep paralysis?
</P>
<P>
   Even after many years of study, particularly in the last decade,
it remains mysterious. Experts have trouble even saying
definitively whether a person is asleep or awake during sleep
paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the classic definition, you are awake,'' said Emmanuel
Mignot, director of the Center for Narcolepsy at Stanford
University Medical School. ``But in practice, there's a gradient
between being awake and being in REM sleep,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During REM sleep _ the period when rapid eye movement takes
place _ the body essentially turns itself off and disconnects from
the brain. This is a safety measure, so that people do not
physically act out their dreams, and it means that people are
effectively paralyzed during part of their sleep. Even automatic
reflexes, like kicking when the knee is tapped, do not work during
REM sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Sleep paralysis seems to occur when the body is in REM sleep and
so is paralyzed and disconnected from the brain, while the brain
has emerged from sleep and is either awake or semiawake. Usually
after a minute or two the spell is broken and the person is able to
move again, as the brain and body re-establish their connection.
</P>
<P>
   What is going on in the brain during sleep paralysis is unclear.
The person experiencing the paralysis feels completely awake and
``sees'' the room clearly, but laboratory experiments in Japan show
that sometimes people experiencing sleep paralysis do not even open
their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Sleep paralysis sometimes runs in families and appears to have a
genetic component. Although it is normally harmless, some scholars
believe it may be linked to a pattern of unexplained deaths among
Hmong and other groups in Southeast Asia. The victims are usually
healthy young people who die in their sleep, sometimes after
fighting for breath but without thrashing around, and their faces
show grimaces of terror.
</P>
<P>
   Among ordinary people, sleep paralysis occurs most often after
jet lag or periods of sleeplessness that interrupt normal REM
patterns. Men and women seem to suffer it at equal rates, and
although it is most common in the teen-age years, it is reported at
all ages.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from witchcraft and alien abduction, sleep paralysis is
also sometimes mentioned as a possible link to shamanism and to
dream interpretation and even to near-death experiences. But for
many sufferers, the growing research in the field is reassuring
simply because it demonstrates that they are not alone in their
terrifying night-time paralysis and hallucinations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I'm just glad that I didn't live a long time ago,''
said Terrillon, the Canadian physicist in Japan. ``Because maybe
people who had this in the olden days were put in madhouses.''

PERSONAL HEALTH: FINDING THE RIGHT WAY TO KEEP LYME DISEASE AT
BAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is no time to get complacent about Lyme disease, the most
common tick-borne illness in the country. Although the Food and
Drug Administration licensed the first Lyme disease vaccine for
people in December, we continue to have problems preventing this
usually treatable but sometimes devastating bacterial disease. The
three-dose vaccine is effective but not perfect, and
disease-bearing ticks are expected to be unusually abundant this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Even if fully vaccinated, everyone who ventures outdoors in
areas where ticks carrying the Lyme bacteria are likely to be
present is at risk of contracting the disease and would be wise to
observe all the usual precautions about preventing tick bites.
These bacteria, spirochetes with the scientific name Borrelia
burgdorferi, are typically carried by tiny deer ticks that feed on
white-footed mice and lizards as well as deer, people and pets.
</P>
<P>
   The new vaccine, called Lymerix and marketed by SmithKline
Beecham, was not greeted with unbridled enthusiasm by the FDA's
advisory committee, which reluctantly recommended its approval. In
fact, the head of the committee, Dr. Patricia L. Ferrieri of the
University of Minnesota Medical School, said at the time, ``It's
rare that a vaccine is voted on with such ambivalence and such a
stack of provisos.''
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine is highly unusual. It works by attacking the Lyme
organisms while they are still in an infected tick; the attack
occurs when the tick starts feeding on the blood of a vaccinated
person. The vaccine triggers the production of antibodies to a
protein called OspA on the coat of the spirochetes. It takes 24 to
72 hours of feeding time before the tick sends spirochetes through
its saliva into an unsuspecting host. So as the tick begins to
extract its meal of blood, antibodies from the vaccinated person
are consumed along with it and kill the spirochetes before they
reach the tick's saliva.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine is given in three doses _ the first two are a month
apart and the third comes 11 months later _ at a total cost of
about $150 (not including doctor fees). If just the first two doses
are taken, the vaccine is only 50 percent effective in preventing
Lyme disease. All three doses were shown in studies involving
nearly 11,000 people to be 78 percent effective, and a more recent
study by the manufacturer indicated that the vaccine works equally
well if the third dose is given after six months.
</P>
<P>
   This means, however, that even when people are fully vaccinated,
about one person in five remains at risk of getting Lyme disease.
Also, the immunity wears off with time, and booster doses, perhaps
given annually, are likely to be needed.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, since the tests for safety and effectiveness were
conducted on people between the ages of 15 and 70, the vaccine has
not yet been approved for use in children and the elderly. Nor was
the vaccine tested in pregnant women, so it is not known if it is
safe for them to be immunized. The manufacturer is now testing the
vaccine in children 4 to 15 years of age, a group more likely than
most adults to be cavorting in areas where ticks are found.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem involves the ability to diagnose a case of Lyme
disease accurately in a vaccinated person. The usual test, called
Elisa, may appear positive even though the person is not infected,
and doctors may have to use the more costly Western blot test.
</P>
<P>
   There are also long-term safety concerns. The human immune
system has a nasty habit of making mistakes; it sometimes produces
antibodies to its own tissues, resulting in autoimmune diseases.
The OspA protein on the spirochete's coat resembles a protein in
the human body, and there is a real concern that in some vaccinated
people, the immune system will begin attacking itself and
spirochetes, resulting in an incurable illness requiring potent
medications to control.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA advisory committee also has raised concerns about
whether vaccinated people are at greater than average risk of
acquiring treatment-resistant arthritis, neurological damage or
heart disease, all of which can occur in people with severe
untreated Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term surveillance _ for a decade or more _ is needed to
determine whether such risks exist, and so far vaccinated
individuals have been followed for only a few years. The Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention recommends against vaccinating
people who have had treatment-resistant Lyme arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   Lyme disease has been reported in 48 states. But Lyme-carrying
ticks are most abundant in the Northeast, the Upper Midwest and
some parts of Northern California and the Pacific Northwest. For
people who work or frequently play in wooded or overgrown grassy
areas where Lyme disease and deer are common, the prevailing advice
is that the benefits of vaccination outweigh any known or potential
risks. Travelers to such areas may consider vaccination if they
expect to experience frequent or prolonged exposure to tick
habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greatest risk of being vaccinated would be
complacency about the chances of getting Lyme disease. Remember,
the vaccine does not always work. Even if you are fully immunized,
experts say that the usual anti-tick precautions are needed: cover
up and use a tick repellent. When out in or around tick habitats,
wear long sleeves and light-colored long pants with cuffs tucked
into your socks. Spray your pants, socks and shoes with a tick
repellent, like permethrin, and use Deet on exposed skin.
</P>
<P>
   Pets can be protected with a repellent that is applied between
the shoulders each month during tick season. It spreads across the
skin and kills ticks before they can transmit Lyme disease. Ask
your veterinarian what is best for your pet.
</P>
<P>
   After every outing in tick-infested areas, take off all your
clothes and check your skin for ticks. Also check your pets and
children. In fact, making a family tick check a part of your daily
routine is a good idea, because the prompt removal of ticks can
help prevent infection. Deer ticks are very small and have
elongated bodies (the more common wood ticks are larger and round).
The deer tick, about the size of a poppy seed when it first
attaches, enlarges as it feeds. Do not touch the tick when you
remove it. Use a fine-pointed tweezer or a simple plastic
spoon-like tool called Ticked Off, sold in some pharmacies and
stores catering to outdoor activities.
</P>
<P>
   Also pay attention to every red circular rash you may develop
whether or not you have removed a tick from that area. A
``bulls-eye'' rash that often clears in the center as it spreads
outward is the hallmark of a Lyme infection. So are flu-like
symptoms. Arthritis, neurological symptoms and heart abnormalities
occur weeks to months after infection, and are considered signs of
late disease. So act fast. Get to a doctor without delay if you
suspect infection.
</P>
<P>
   Lyme disease is diagnosed definitively through a blood test,
although waiting for the results can delay needed treatment. If
Lyme disease is treated early with effective antibiotics, the
debilitating, long-lasting consequences can almost always be
prevented. Early cases are best treated with one of three
antibiotics taken for 10 to 21 days: amoxicillin (500 milligrams
three times a day), doxycycline (100 milligrams twice a day) or
cefuroxime axetil (500 milligrams twice a day).

NAVIGATING THE OPTIONS FOR PROSTATE CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(HLW) 
 By NANCY BETH JACKSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A man facing prostate cancer can find himself lost in a forest
of contradictory treatment options even before the final diagnosis
is in.
</P>
<P>
   To help negotiate the often still-uncharted terrain, the
American Cancer Society and the National Comprehensive Cancer
Network, a coalition of 17 top cancer centers, have issued
diagnostic and treatment guidelines based on how prostate cancer is
most commonly treated and diagnosed today.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to laying out details about the disease and
therapies, including side effects, the report offers a flow chart
called variously an algorithm, decision tree, and a clinical
pathway to show where decisions will lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a deluge of information, but the problem is that it's
just facts without structure,'' said Dr. Rodger Winn, associate
professor of community oncology at the University of Texas M.D.
Anderson Cancer Center and chair of the National Comprehensive
Cancer Network guidelines steering committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point of the guidelines,'' he said, ``is to lay out the
options and help individuals understand what the choice means.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone agrees that the guidelines do that.
</P>
<P>
   The American Cancer Society translated the original network
guidelines for oncology professionals into a more user-friendly
text, but it may still be difficult to understand for some.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Scardino, head of the prostate cancer program at
Memorial Sloan-Kettering in New York and a member of Winn's
committee, has reservations about just how user-friendly the
guidelines are for a controversial, complex and evolving disease.
</P>
<P>
   Scardino finds the guidelines, particularly the flow chart, more
useful for other doctors than for patients. He considers them a
legitimate effort to get out a well-reasoned consensus of
possibilities based on current information, but he does not
encourage using the document as a patient's starting point.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Luton, a prostate cancer activist in Atlanta, reviewed the
text to make it more accessible to laymen. He argues that ``nothing
like this has been out there before. This is remarkable input.''
</P>
<P>
   When he asked for something to read about prostate cancer after
his case was diagnosed in 1989, his doctor replied, ``You'll just
have to listen to what I have to say.''
</P>
<P>
   The prostate cancer guidelines follow by four months a similar
document for the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But the prostate cancer guidelines may be less clear-cut and
more controversial because research in prostate cancer is less
conclusive than breast cancer studies, Scardino suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we look at the difference of what we know about breast
cancer and what we know about prostate cancer, the knowledge base
in breast cancer is clearly superior,'' he said. ``We're so much
farther along than we were 10 years ago, but we sure do need more
information.''
</P>
<P>
   Prostate Cancer Treatment Guidelines for Patients, (Version 1,
July 1999) can be accessed through www.cancer.org or www.nccn.org.
A copy may also be obtained by calling (800) 227-2345 or (888)
909-6226.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines will be updated annually and more frequently
online if research indicates major changes in the field.

FROM `JEWEL IN THE CROWN' TO A MAN OF MANY FACETS 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By MERVYN ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tim Pigott-Smith's 14 episodes of fame came in the mid-1980s,
when his portrayal of the sadistic police superintendent Ronald
Merrick in ``The Jewel in the Crown'' made him the villain British
and American television viewers loved to hate. In the ensuing 14
years, Pigott-Smith has had a busy career, but fame has not been
part of it. And, he said, he doesn't miss it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fame is a difficult commodity to handle, and I was never
really interested in it,'' Pigott-Smith said. The 52-year-old
actor, looking trim and fit in denim shirt, jeans and open sandals,
chatted over tea and pastry at a hotel coffee shop down the block
from the Brooks Atkinson Theater, where he is portraying the failed
anarchist Larry Slade in the critically hailed revival of Eugene
O'Neill's ``Iceman Cometh.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fame changed my life completely because for a while I was in a
position to choose what I did,'' he said. ``I miss that aspect. But
I always felt uncomfortable with it. People used to say to me,
`Tim, you're a star now.' But I'm a character actor. I guess I
still have a certain celebrity status because people remember
`Jewel in the Crown' very potently. But it was a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Pigott-Smith is one of a cast of 19 in ``The Iceman Cometh,''
among them Kevin Spacey in his Tony-nominated role as Hickey, the
salesman of death who arrives in 1912 at Harry Hope's skid row bar
_ the No Chance Saloon, the Bedrock Bar, the End of the Line Cafe _
to rouse its drunken denizens from their pipe dreams. The
production, directed by Howard Davies, was first presented at the
Almeida Theater in London.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 14 years, Pigott-Smith has starred in London in
Michael Frayn's ``Benefactors,'' in a role Simon Jones later did on
Broadway. He acted in a series of plays directed by Sir Peter Hall
at the National Theater, playing Leontes in ``The Winter's Tale''
and Octavius in ``Antony and Cleopatra'' with Dame Judi Dench. He
ran a theater company, Compass, touring all over England with ``The
Royal Hunt of the Sun,'' ``Julius Caesar'' and ``Amadeus'' (he
played Salieri) and directing for the first time. And he starred on
British television in a series called ``The Chief,'' in which he
played a chief constable.
</P>
<P>
   He also tried his hand at the movies. ``Everybody wants a movie
career,'' he said. ``I found that pretty elusive. I did make a
movie with Martin Sheen about a nuclear scientist who has a
religious experience. I don't even know what it was called. I don't
think it was ever released.''
</P>
<P>
   Another attempt was more successful: He portrayed the husband of
Emma Thompson's character in ``The Remains of the Day'' in 1993.
``I do small parts in movies now and then,'' he said. ``But really
that was the last movie I made. I get offered work that I just
don't want to do. But I'm also at an age when I get offered less
work. Because you hit your 50s and suddenly you're not playing the
leading roles. Because they're written for people much younger.''
</P>
<P>
   Back home, he said, audiences these days are often more familiar
with his voice than his face. ``I earn a lot of money in England
doing voice-overs, especially in documentaries,'' he said. ``Turn
on the Discovery Channel here and you'll hear my voice a lot. It
subsidizes my vice of acting in the theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Pigott-Smith looks quite different now from the way he did as
Ronald Merrick. For his current role he shaved the top of his head
and grew a full beard _ a beard that has more than a few flecks of
gray. ``My normal hair is thin, but not completely bald,'' he said.
``I haven't cut my hair or beard since early February, when we came
here to do the play, and I won't cut it until we finish. It helps
me get into being Larry, who's a much older person.''
</P>
<P>
   It is Larry who first gives voice to O'Neill's thesis, that
``the lie of a pipe dream is what gives life to the whole
misbegotten mad lot of us, drunk or sober.'' Larry declares that
his own pipe dreams are all dead and buried and that he eagerly
awaits the ``fine long sleep of death.'' But, of course, that too
is a lie, and in fact he clings to life with all his might.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry doesn't believe he's attached to anything,''
Pigott-Smith said. ``He thinks he has denied everything. You have
to demonstrate to the audience very early on that he's as
self-deceived as the rest of the characters.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the actors in the play, Pigott-Smith is onstage for
all or almost all of its four acts, for more than four hours. ``On
Saturdays, when you do it twice, you get so involved in the world
of the bar that it's hard to remove yourself when the evening is
over,'' he said. ``The lights go down, and sometimes I don't know
where I am. Sometimes it feels as if I'm in a real bar.''
</P>
<P>
   Pigott-Smith was born in Rugby, a small town not far from
Stratford-on-Avon, but his family soon moved to Nairobi, Kenya,
after his father, a journalist, got a job with The East African
Standard. They returned to Leicester, an industrial town in the
Midlands, where he went to school for 10 years. Then his father was
hired as editor of a weekly newspaper in Stratford-on-Avon, and
after the family moved there in 1962 the teen-age Tim was
introduced to the Royal Shakespeare Company.
</P>
<P>
   He began to immerse himself in theater. After Stratford Grammar
School, he worked in the paint shop and props department of the
Royal Shakespeare Company. He went off to Bristol University, and
then to the Bristol Old Vic Theater School. He acted in classical
theater with the Royal Shakespeare Company, playing Dr. Watson in
the company's 1974 New York ``Sherlock Holmes'' _ his only previous
Broadway experience _ before moving increasingly into television.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iceman Cometh'' is on Broadway for a limited run, through
July 17, and Pigott-Smith said he did not know what he would be
doing next. ``I think Kevin Spacey wants to film the play for
television, and I would love to do that,'' he said. ``Aside from
that I don't really care, as long as it's good work.'' He will
probably head home to see his wife of 27 years, the British actress
Pamela Miles, and their son, Tom. ``Pamela and I did `Sherlock
Holmes' together,'' he said. ``I was Watson and she was the French
maid.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been back to India only once since ``The Jewel in the
Crown,'' which was seen in 1984 and 1985 on American public
television and was adapted from Paul Scott's ``Raj Quartet,'' a
series of novels about the waning days of British rule in India.
The latest trip was to do documentary work in Calcutta. He said he
still had a deep affection for India and hoped to return again.
</P>
<P>
   Pigott-Smith also has a nontheatrical career, as a writer. He
wrote scripts for the Calcutta documentaries and has a contract to
do three children's books while in New York. ``I enjoy writing,''
he said. ``Maybe that's my father's journalistic gene coming out.
The children's books have to do with Sherlock Holmes. I just
finished the first draft of the first. So I've been using my time
here quite gainfully.''
</P>
<P>
   And he has a new hobby. ``About a month ago I learned how to
Rollerblade,'' he said. ``I haven't told my wife yet, let alone my
producer. Sometimes I Rollerblade to work, but it's most lovely in
the park, and it's really quite safe there. I do it quite
carefully, and I wear all the gear.''
</P>
<P>
   He smiled. ``I'm a survivor,'' he said. ``Not a speeder.''

<P>
   Everybody loves dolphins, those playful models of animal wisdom,
celebrated for protecting shipwrecked sailors and spending their
days frolicking happily in the waves. Movies, television and water
shows feature their antics.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, thousands of tourists swim with dolphins, captive and
wild, with more signing up every day to commune with their animal
intelligence. Most recently, a variety of organizations have sprung
up that offer tours to places like the Florida Keys, the Azores and
New Zealand, where participants can swim with wild dolphins and,
brochures proclaim, experience emotional healing and spiritual
awakening.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists, following a trail of bloody clues, are
discovering that dolphins are far from the happy, peaceful
creatures that humans think they know.
</P>
<P>
   Growing evidence shows that the big animals, up to 12 feet long,
are killing fellow mammals in droves, wielding their beaks as clubs
and slashing away with rows of sharp teeth. Dolphins have been
found to bludgeon porpoises to death by the hundreds. Unlike most
animal killers, which eat their prey, dolphins seem to have
murderous urges unrelated to the need for food.
</P>
<P>
   They have even been observed in recurring acts of infanticide.
</P>
<P>
   Off Scotland, a scientist watched in shock for nearly an hour as
an adult dolphin repeatedly picked up a baby in its mouth and
smacked it against the water, over and over, until it sank from
view.
</P>
<P>
   Off Virginia, researchers found at least nine baby dolphins
killed, their ribs broken, their skulls and vertebrae smashed. One
small body bore puncture marks matching the pattern of adult
dolphin teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have such a benign image of dolphins,'' said Dr. Dale J.
Dunn, a veterinary pathologist at the Armed Forces Institute of
Pathology in Washington, who aided the Virginia study. ``So finding
evidence of violence is disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   More widely, scientists and federal officials worry about
dolphins' injuring or even killing humans, especially given the
rise in watching, feeding and swimming programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wildlife can be dangerous,'' said Trevor R. Spradlin, a
federal dolphin expert. ``But people see marine mammals
differently, particularly dolphins. There's this misconception that
they're friendly, that they're Flipper, that they want to play with
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Commerce Department's National Marine Fisheries
Service, where Spradlin works, have begun an educational campaign
that sends out brochures to marinas, schools and fairs in coastal
areas where people and dolphins interact, urging caution and
warning of peril.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dozens of bites have been reported,'' says one flier. ``And
people have been pulled under water. A woman who fed a pair of
dolphins and then jumped into the water to swim with them was
bitten. ``I literally ripped my left leg out of its mouth,'' she
said during her one-week stay in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Amy Samuels, a scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution on Cape Cod, who studies interactions between dolphins
and people, said injuries had been relatively minor so far. But she
added, ``Just because dolphins have a smile doesn't mean they're
nonaggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, dolphin commerce is loosely regulated, and
many countries have no rules at all. An American ban on feeding
wild dolphins is routinely ignored by tour boats, which use food to
lure dolphins nearby so people wearing masks and snorkels can swim
among the creatures. Federal rules on how to handle captive
dolphins, completed last year, were suspended after swim centers
objected to some provisions. Revised rules are not expected until
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts say tourist attractions will remain largely
unfettered until a major accident occurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're big, wild animals,'' said Dr. Andrew J. Read, a
biologist at the Duke University Marine Laboratory who studies
dolphin attacks. ``And people should respect them as such.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, dolphin savagery pales in comparison with the
brutality of people, who have managed to kill millions of dolphins
while fishing for tuna. The dolphins, which breathe air, drown when
large purse seine nets close over their heads. Fishery reforms seek
to limit the slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Closely related to whales, the 32 species that make up the
dolphin family (Delphinidae in scientific nomenclature) include
killer whales, which grow up to 30 feet long and are famous for
their aggressive hunting pods. But the rest are smaller. The common
dolphin is up to 7 feet long, and the bottlenose, up to 12 feet.
Many dolphins have a pronounced beak and all have a central dorsal
fin and sharp teeth for feeding, mainly on squid and fish.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly for humans, the mouths of many species turn upward
in a perpetual grin. As a result, the animals have long fascinated
people. Ancient Greeks reported altruism in dolphins, saying they
had rescued lost seafarers, and often depicted the animals in art.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins are highly social and appear to communicate among
themselves with a wide range of clicks, whistles and beeps, though
scientists who study them say they do not actually have a complex
language. Experts say dolphins are smarter than dogs and similar in
intelligence to chimpanzees.
</P>
<P>
   The new-age dolphin operations go much further. In
advertisements and tour promotions, they say dolphins are highly
evolved spiritual beings. The dolphin's mere glance is
enlightening, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dolphins reach deep into our souls, opening the door to our
hearts,'' Marie-Helene Roussel said in an advertisement for her
Delphines Center, which is on the Web at www.dolphinswim.com.
Anyone with $1,600 can join her late this month on a six-day sail
around Bimini in the Bahamas for ``healing encounters'' with
dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Her partner, Swami Anand Buddha, a former Louisiana lifeguard,
says he found unconditional love, peace and bliss when he first
looked into the eyes of a wild dolphin. ``This,'' he says on the
Web site, ``is why I am working with people who are interested in
exploring the potential of being transformed by love and higher
intelligence of the dolphins.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Now that image is being shattered as scientists document the
grim slaughters. The research began around 1990 after large-scale
deaths of dolphins and other marine mammals were discovered
globally. In Europe and the United States, observation programs
were started that sought the biological, ecological and behavioral
secrets of wild dolphins. At first, a virus was implicated in many
of the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The first clues to the deliberate killings were found on a large
bay on the northeast coast of Scotland known as the Moray Firth, an
arm of the North Sea, by Dr. Ben Wilson, a dolphin expert at the
University of Aberdeen, and Dr. Harry M. Ross, a veterinarian at
the Scottish Agricultural College. They focused on harbor
porpoises, marine mammals up to five feet long, that were turning
up dead with a strange mix of injuries, including multiple skeletal
fractures and damaged internal organs.
</P>
<P>
   Suspects included boats and fishing nets. But in 1994 the
researchers discovered a newly killed porpoise, its flank torn by
bloody tooth marks _ marks that perfectly matched the 0.45-inch
spacing of the teeth of adult bottlenose dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was, `Oh my God, the animals I've been studying for the
last 10 years are killing these porpoises,''' Wilson recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Other evidence quickly fell into place. Of the 105 porpoise
post-mortems the team had done on animals found around the bay from
1991 to 1993, 42 showed clear evidence of dolphin attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The case was much strengthened after the team began finding
people who had witnessed dolphin attacks. Observers twice saw the
porpoises escape. Two apparent killings by a group of dolphins were
captured on videotape.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the team published its findings in Proceedings of the
Royal Society, a British journal. ``These findings challenge the
benign image of bottlenose dolphins,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   But still they did not know why the dolphins killed. Perhaps
porpoises and dolphins competed for food, the scientists reasoned,
or perhaps the porpoises were seen as a threat to young or ill
dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   The killings of dolphin calves only deepened the riddle. The
victims were roughly four feet in length _ about the same size as
the dead porpoises. In all, the team found five dead dolphin calves
with fractured ribs, ruptured lungs and spinal dislocations.
</P>
<P>
   Again, witnesses and videotape aided the hunt for evidence. In
one case, Wilson himself watched in amazement for 53 minutes as a
calf was hit, seized and butted into the air by an adult bottlenose
dolphin.
</P>
<P>
   In all cases, the aggressor's sex was unknown. But the
scientists speculated that the killers might be male dolphins
trying to destroy rival offspring and free up females for mating.
Females, the researchers say, become attractive to males within a
few days of losing a calf and apparently, when tending youngsters,
stay sexually inactive for years.
</P>
<P>
   Infanticide is common in nature. Females kill their young when
food is scarce and male lions and bears, for example, sometimes
kill the young of a female taken as a new mate, giving them a
reproductive and evolutionary edge.
</P>
<P>
   The Scottish scientists published these new findings last year
in Proceedings of the Royal Society, saying it was ``the first
evidence of infanticide in cetaceans,'' the scientific grouping for
whales, dolphins and porpoises. They speculated that the assaults
on porpoises might develop ``skills used in infanticidal attacks,''
or alternatively might stem from simple aggression or sexual
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an American group was independently making similar
discoveries as dead porpoises and baby dolphins were washing up
along the Virginia coast, many with the telltale internal wounds.
Suspicions were first aroused in 1997 when a baby dolphin was
discovered with bruises, broken ribs and a lacerated lung. A check
of specimens in 1996 and 1997 revealed eight other unusual baby
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only one had a bite mark,'' recalled Susan G. Barco, a
research scientist at the Virginia Marine Science Museum in
Virginia Beach, Va. ``And the distance between the teeth matched
that of the bottlenose dolphin. There was no evidence of shark
bites or boat damage.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Ms. Barco, the Virginia group includes Dunn of
the Armed Forces Institute and Dr. Ann Pabst and Dr. William
McLellan of the University of North Carolina at Wilmington.
</P>
<P>
   Read of Duke University, a porpoise expert who is aiding the
Virginia study, said evolutionary factors seemed a likely
explanation for the infanticide. The porpoise deaths, he added,
were harder to understand. The two kinds of marine mammals eat
different fishes, he said, so food competition is unlikely. ``And
there are very few instances when one mammal kills another when
there is no risk of predation,'' Read added.
</P>
<P>
   The emerging consensus is that wild dolphins can be cold-blooded
killers.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials say dolphins pose little threat to people in
captive swim programs, where the animals are usually well-trained
and closely supervised by experts working in pools and enclosed
bays. During the past five years, the number of such businesses
have risen to 18 from 4, said Dr. Barbara A. Kohn, a veterinarian
at the Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service, which oversees the field.
</P>
<P>
   Through 1994, Dr. Kohn said, statistics showed that the injury
rate was less than 1 in 10,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty good,'' she said, adding that no serious
injuries had been reported since then. ``So it continues to be
fairly safe.''
</P>
<P>
   The danger, experts agree, is when people swim with dolphins in
the wild, an increasingly popular, unregulated sport. For instance,
Panama City, Fla., has a half-dozen boats offering such adventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a time bomb waiting to go off,'' said Stephanie K.
Dorezas, a spokeswomen for the National Marine Fisheries Service,
which oversees dolphins in American coastal waters.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials say the recent scientific findings about wild
dolphins and recent mishaps with the big animals are giving the
federal warning campaign a new degree of urgency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to prevent people from going to the beach or
going on dolphin watches,'' said Spradlin of the fisheries service.
``But they need to do it safely and responsibly. It's like bird
watchers or people on safari. That same kind of caution and respect
needs to be applied to sea life.'' &QL;

MEDICINE'S STEAMY SIDE, FOR AND ABOUT INTERNS
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Ohio, Wis., Mass., Calif.)  (nk) 
 By WENDY MARSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first of July marks the day that hospitals open their doors
to the new crop of interns, a number of them clutching dog-eared
copies of a pot-boiler novel called ``The House of God.'' Published
21 years ago, the book chronicles a year in the life of an intern
training at one of the best hospitals in the country, which the
author will not identify.
</P>
<P>
   Though the book is virtually unknown outside the health care
field, despite an introduction by John Updike, it is passed from
one intern to the next and has sold more than two million copies.
</P>
<P>
   A few years after its publication, ``The House of God'' inspired
a heated exchange in the letters column of The New England Journal
of Medicine. Some physicians saw the book as being contemptuous of
chronically ill patients and disparaging of older doctors. Others,
however, defended it as an honest portrayal of modern medicine.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Dr. Anne Hudson Jones of the University of Texas
Medical Branch in Galveston, wrote in The Lancet, a British
journal, that ``The House of God'' and Sinclair Lewis'
``Arrowsmith'' were this century's pivotal medical novels. ``It's
an underground classic on medical campuses,'' Dr. Hudson Jones said
in an interview. ``But it was scandalous when it came out. A lot of
doctors, especially older ones, were concerned over the language
and the attitude toward patients in it.''
</P>
<P>
   The novel, published in paperback by Dell, was written by Dr.
Stephen Bergman, the year after his own medical internship when he
was a psychiatry resident at Harvard. Bergman wrote under the pen
name Samuel Shem. (Now a professor of psychiatry at Harvard, he
said he used a pen name to protect his psychiatric patients.) In
his book, he detailed gory deaths, multiple medical errors and
steamy sex scenes with voluptuous and willing nurses; the novel is
a curious mix of a much grimmer ``E.R.'' and an Erica Jong sex
comedy. The main character in the book, an intern named Roy G.
Basch, learns the true laws of medicine, including ``Gomers don't
die.'' The term Gomer refers to the elderly and chronically ill
patients and stands for ``Get Out of My Emergency Room.'' Although
Bergman, 54, admits that rampant sex in a hospital has abated since
the 1970s, the rest still holds true. ``All the horrific parts are
real,'' he said. ``It's the `Catch-22' of medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Other doctors agree. Dr. James Siy, 32, an internist in
Milwaukee, says: ``We still divide patients into Gomers and Dying
Young. That's a large part of the sadness of medicine that still
exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt the same way his characters did,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Word of mouth has been the book's driving force. A pulmonary
specialist, Dr. Laurence Martin, 55, of Mount Sinai Hospital in
Cleveland, invokes it in a hospital survival guide, which he
distributes to residents and interns. ``Most doctors wish they had
written it themselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But not all share that desire. Dr. Matthew Spitzer, 30, a family
practitioner in San Francisco, resisted reading ``The House of
God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I avoided it throughout medical school because I thought I
wasn't a cynical doctor. But when I read it at the end of fourth
year, I thought, `well, basically my life is this book.'''
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer, though unimpressed with Dr. Bergman's writing, believes
that the novel does a service. ``The book is really a piece of
trash, but it's true. It's what your family doesn't want to hear
and your friends don't want to know.''

<P>
   Many women suffering from urinary tract infections may be able
to skip a trip to the doctor's office, be safely diagnosed and
receive prescriptions by telephone, according to a study in the
current issue of The American Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Almost half of all American women are plagued by uncomplicated
urinary tract infections, also known as cystitis. The irritating
symptoms include an urge to urinate frequently, burning sensations
and sometimes bleeding during urination. The disorder is often
diagnosed with a urine test and treated with antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the University of Michigan Medical Center and the
University of Washington in Seattle wanted to find out if the urine
test could be eliminated, because most women who have had the
condition know the symptoms, which are generally easily recognized
by doctors.
</P>
<P>
   In the study of 3,889 patients treated for the disorder in a
two-year period, nurses at 24 clinics used a set of guidelines to
help determine if patients suffered from the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Two clinics did not use the guidelines and served as controls.
</P>
<P>
   Forty percent of patients who called after the guidelines were
put into effect received telephone diagnosis and treatment. Of
these, 64 percent who described suffering from urinary tract
symptoms were given urinalysis, compared with 85 percent before the
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also reported no significant difference between
the number of women who needed follow-up care for recurring urinary
tract infections or other potentially misdiagnosed ailments among
cases that had been treated before or after the guidelines took
effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the appropriate clinical settings, this telephone-based
approach is safe, conventional and cost effective,'' said Dr.
Sanjay Saint, assistant professor of internal medicine at
University of Michigan Health System and lead author of the study.
``Women can get faster and equally effective help, saving time and
money that is wasted on urine tests and doctor visits.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Nicolette Horbach, an associate clinical professor at
Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, cautioned, ``In
simple uncomplicated UTI in low risk patients, phone treatment is
appropriate, but it can't be used with all patients,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ALISHA BERGER
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IN CASES OF STROKE, UNEQUAL TREATMENT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A study that tracked 803 middle-aged men who had suffered
strokes found that African-American patients were less likely than
whites to get a diagnostic test to determine whether they were
eligible for a surgical procedure meant to prevent recurrent
strokes.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published in the current issue of Stroke, the journal
of the American Heart Association, did not pinpoint a single cause
for the discrepancy. In fact, the researchers ruled out economic
considerations because all the patients were being treated in
Veterans Administration hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, stroke victims are evaluated using either
ultrasound or angiography to determine if there are dangerously
high levels of plaque on the walls of the carotid arteries, which
supply blood to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Surgery called carotid endarterectomy has become a common method
for reducing such plaque buildups.
</P>
<P>
   But in the study, only 67 percent of the African-American
patients underwent carotid testing, compared with 79 percent of
white patients.
</P>
<P>
   The study's lead researcher, Dr. Eugene Oddone, who holds titles
at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Durham, N.C., and
at Duke University Medical Center, said that earlier studies had
found even greater disparities, but that this was the first to show
that a gap remained even after physiological differences between
the races were taken into account.
</P>
<P>
   Oddone speculated about two possible reasons for the disparity.
``There may be a racial difference in the way treatment options are
communicated to patients by their physicians,'' he said, adding
that the communication could lead more black patients to decline an
endarterectomy.
</P>
<P>
   Many doctors believe that blacks are more likely to have plaque
buildups in their brain arteries, making them poor candidates for
the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Oddone said, African-Americans who were
tested were operated on at roughly the same rate as whites.

`INVESTIGATIVE REPORTS': IN SEARCH OF THE REASONS FOR ANTI-GAY
VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Wyo., Ark., Idaho, Ark.) (Eds: Production notes at end of review.)

 By WALTER GOODMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   If any question remains of the viciousness of recent physical
attacks on gay people, Tuesday night's graphic pictures from
Wyoming, Arkansas and Idaho should settle the matter. Whether they
signal a rise in such crimes, however, or in the depth of the
incidents of rage that have stunned the nation is less certain, and
``Anti-Gay Hate Crimes'' offers more resurgence than evidence.
</P>
<P>
   This episode of ``Investigative Reports'' suggests, not
implausibly, that an increasing public acceptance of gay men and
lesbians has invited a backlash that has brought fresh eruptions of
violence. But the question of whether the young men who have been
convicted of murders and assaults represent something more than
individual aberrations requires stronger evidence than the
sometimes propaganda-thick psychological tags that are provided.
</P>
<P>
   There are troubling examples, however, of the heated language,
mostly from the religious right, that is probably provoking
congregations to take literally the inveighing about homosexuals'
being damned for eternity. With preachers transmitting charges that
gay people are corrupting the nation by doing the devil's work, it
is easy for impressionable youths to conclude that tormenting
schoolmates is a road to salvation. One Arkansas boy tells of being
assaulted by eight other boys and in effect being driven out of his
school.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the dispute over what to do about ``hate crimes'' except
to deplore them could use more reasoned discussion than is provided
here. Should seemingly victimized groups be signaled out for
special protection from what after all are already crimes? Is
``hate crime'' a category of offense that calls for especially
severe punishment? Tuesday night's pictures, though they turn the
stomach, contribute little to deeper analysis.

   &UR; MONITORING PROTEIN FOLDS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Folding laundry is one of life's miserable chores, but doing it
properly is not all that difficult, with a little practice. Folding
proteins is one of the biotechnology industry's miserable chores,
and it can be very hard.
</P>
<P>
   A protein is a long chain molecule, and has to fold just so _
twist and turn into a precise shape that allows it to react with
other molecules. The problem is, recombinant proteins produced in
living cells often misfold and can wind up in a useless clump, like
wrinkled shirts balled up in the dryer.
</P>
<P>
   Now, researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory have come up
with a technique that uses light _ specifically, the green light
emitted by a protein found in jellyfish _ to help determine if a
protein has folded correctly.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, who described the technique in the current
issue of the journal Nature Biotechnology, fused the jellyfish
protein, known as green fluorescent protein, to 20 randomly
selected proteins from a bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   They then measured how much fluorescence occurred with each
protein, and found that the amount of light was proportional to the
amount of correctly folded protein.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers suggest that the technique can be used in the
directed evolution of proteins _ a process of selecting genetic
mutations and recombining them, over and over, to customize a
protein for a specific task.
</P>
<P>
   By measuring the amount of folding, the green light test could
provide one clue for scientists to tell whether such evolution is
heading in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   BAMBI'S CUTER KIN
</P>
<P>
   Deer have a reputation for cuteness, thanks in no small part to
the antics of a frolicking fawn in a certain Disney movie. Now
comes word of a deer that can out-Bambi Bambi. It is the smallest
deer species in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The deer is known as a leaf muntjac, and adults measure just 20
inches at the shoulder, with a weight of about 25 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   They were discovered by a biologist with the Wildlife
Conservation Society (which is based at the Bronx Zoo) during a
field survey of mountainous areas in northern Myanmar, formerly
Burma. DNA testing confirmed that they were a separate species from
other muntjacs, which are known for their distinctive barking
sound.
</P>
<P>
   The animal is the latest in a string of new mammal species
discovered in remote parts of Southeast Asia this decade.
</P>
<P>
   CASSINI'S CRUCIAL COURSE
</P>
<P>
   The Cassini spacecraft has made the second of its two flybys of
Venus, using the planet's gravity to pick up speed on its way to
Saturn, which it should reach in 2004. The next planet to provide a
shot of energy to the spacecraft is Earth, which Cassini will
approach next month.
</P>
<P>
   The craft, which is expected to spend four years exploring
Saturn from orbit and landing a probe on its largest moon, Titan,
passed within 370 miles of Venus on June 24. Such a maneuver
functions something like a slingshot, boosting the spacecraft's
speed for its long journey.
</P>
<P>
   Cassini was launched in October 1997, and a previous Venus
approach took place in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Both the flybys were right on target, a fact that might provide
some reassurance for critics of the project who have been concerned
about the chances for a catastrophic accident when the craft nears
Earth on Aug. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Cassini is carrying 72 pounds of plutonium in a generator to
provide heat and power (the solar cells that are used by many
spacecraft would be impractical in the outer reaches of the solar
system, so far from the Sun).
</P>
<P>
   The critics have feared that if the craft is slightly off
course, and approaches Earth much closer than the intended 725
miles, the atmospheric friction could cause it to burn up,
spreading a potentially lethal plume of plutonium.
</P>
<P>
   NASA has argued that the possibility of such a breakup is
extremely small, and that even if it did occur, the plutonium is in
a form that would greatly reduce any risks to health. But the best
insurance against any problems is a spacecraft that is on its
intended course.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Alarmed by what they see as the potential for mishaps with
patients taking herbal remedies for everything from depression to
memory loss, anesthesiologists have begun urging people to stop
taking the herbs and supplements before having surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say there is growing evidence that substances like St.
John's wort and ginkgo biloba may have dangerous interactions with
the variety of drugs used to anesthetize patients during surgery.
Although hard scientific evidence of a problem is lacking, they
say, anecdotal reports from hospitals suggest that herbal remedies
may be putting some surgery patients at serious risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing you want is someone who knows enough to keep
you out of trouble,'' said Dr. John B. Neeld Jr., president of the
American Society of Anesthesiologists.
</P>
<P>
   The society recently issued a warning to consumers using herbal
medicine to stop taking the products at least two to three weeks
before any scheduled surgery.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the New York State Society of Anesthesiologists
issued a similar warning. The New York group urged patients who
could not go off the drugs in time to bring in the medication in
its original container and show it to the doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Patients, however, are often reluctant to tell their doctors
that they are using nontraditional approaches like herbal
medications, said Dr. Carole W. Agin, director of the pain
management clinic in Port Jefferson, N.Y. ``I think patients fear
that it will somehow drive a wedge between the patient-physician
relationship,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Americans spend about $5 billion a year on herbal products,
which, unlike prescription drugs, are not fully regulated by the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Often, little is known about the substances, their effects and
their interactions with other drugs. And, in some cases, little is
done to assure quality control. Only in rare cases, like the one
involving the stimulant ephedra, when there are persistent reports
of injury or death, does the government take action against an
herbal product.
</P>
<P>
   Anesthesiologists say they are taking no position on the use in
general of herbal remedies, which are sometimes being incorporated
into the practice of traditional medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most common herbals are St. John's wort, which is
said to help with mild depression, and ginkgo, which is taken to
improve memory and blood circulation. Doctors also singled out two
other popular remedies: feverfew, which is said to help ease
migraine headaches; and ginseng, which is taken to improve
vitality.
</P>
<P>
   The possible interactions include an unintended deepening of the
effects of some anesthetics and problems with blood pressure and
bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   One situation that some doctors suspect might be happening in
operating rooms involves ephedra, which, despite being banned by
the federal Food and Drug Administration, is still being taken in
other forms.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, Neeld said, patients in surgery suddenly show
signs of a drop in blood pressure. The anesthesiologist will then
administer a drug like ephedrine, to bring the pressure back up.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, Neeld said, doctors have been surprised to see
the blood pressure shoot back up to dangerous levels that could
cause a stroke or heart attack. The patients later said they had
been taking ephedra.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors emphasize that much study needs to be done to establish
whether there is a real risk for patients taking herbal remedies.
``All of the concern may prove totally unwarranted down the line,''
Neeld said.
</P>
<P>
   The growing herbal industry has raised no objection to the
doctors' warning. Dr. Phillip W. Harvey, director of science and
quality assurance at the National Nutritional Foods Association,
whose 4,000 members make and sell herbal remedies, called the
caution common sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would whole-heartedly support that,'' Harvey said.

`INVISIBLE WORLD': THINKING TOO MUCH ABOUT SOUR RELATIONSHIPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Publication notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At first glance, the central characters in David Gates' polished
new collection of stories seem a varied lot: women caught in
suffocating marriages to pompous, self-absorbed men; a middle-aged
gay man who finds himself taking care of his sister's young son
after she goes into rehab; an elderly retiree who is recuperating
from a devastating stroke that has left him completely dependent on
his wife, and a divorced father who re-encounters his ex-wife while
keeping vigil at his daughter's hospital bed.
</P>
<P>
   In fact ``The Wonders of the Invisible World'' often feels as
though Gates were trying to challenge himself by writing from a
multiplicity of viewpoints _ young and old, straight and gay, male
and female _ all rendered with meticulous emotional detail and an
astringent sense of the absurdities and self-indulgences of
contemporary life.
</P>
<P>
   On closer examination, however, the people in this volume have a
lot in common with one another and with the narcissistic heroes of
Gates' two novels, ``Jernigan'' (1991) and ``Preston Falls''
(1998). Many are inveterate readers, using books not to connect
with the larger world beyond but to shut themselves away inside
their own heads. Most are afflicted with a terminal sense of irony.
And all tend to think too much: about themselves, their
relationships and the day-to-day workings of the world.
</P>
<P>
   When Billy is entrusted with the care of his young nephew, he
finds himself relieved ``that he hasn't found the boy's narrow
nates and teensy penis at all arousing,'' while ``at the same time,
he's irked with himself for being relieved'' _ after all, he
doesn't assume that straight men ``reflexively slaver over girl
children in their care.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Bad Thing'' the narrator muses over her husband's
ability to quit smoking, thinking that ``a man who could pick up a
thing and then just drop it'' could easily leave their marriage,
even though she is ambivalent above their relationship herself. In
``The Crazy Thought,'' Faye wonders why people use the expression
``moral support:'' ``Was the assumption that people's morals needed
help in time of stress? Or was it moral of you to lend support?
This was one of those things that flew apart if you looked too
closely.''
</P>
<P>
   Under such self-scrutiny, these people find their lives
succumbing to the centrifugal forces of rage, resentment and
alienation. Divorce is a fixture in these stories; so are adultery,
alcoholism and betrayal. The anxious heroine of ``Saturn,'' a woman
who is trying ``to get less crazy'' as she enters middle age, jumps
in her car to visit her lover and pulls over at a rest stop to
phone him, only to call her husband by mistake.
</P>
<P>
   The neurotic narrator of ``Beating'' worries about her
passive-aggressive husband's sanity, while she spends her free time
watching a videotape of ``Beauty and the Beast'' over and over
again. The aging filmmaker in ``The Intruder'' picks fights with
his handsome young boyfriend, whom he blames for undermining his
capacity to work.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these people seem destined to spend the rest of their
lives in these sour relationships, using Freud to deconstruct their
problems glibly while allowing inertia and willful pride to trap
them in their delusions. Others find their marriages unraveling at
warp speed.
</P>
<P>
   The self-absorbed narrator of the title story has a desultory
affair and suddenly finds himself living alone in Manhattan while
his ex-wife raises their daughter in Massachusetts. The wronged
wife in ``A Wronged Husband'' abruptly leaves her feckless spouse
after telling him a bizarre lie about her sister's dying.
</P>
<P>
   Though Gates' characters are less romantic than the people in
Richard Yates' fiction, they share a similar sense of
disappointment and a similar inclination to use alcohol as an
escape. Smart, self-conscious and overly articulate, they spend
their days measuring the disconnection between their dreams and the
daily grind of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   In Gates' case, he delineates his characters' predicaments with
a pitch-perfect ear for their defensive humor and bitter wordplay
and a coy knowledge of their undeveloped hearts. At times, however,
he is so deft at uncovering their pretensions and self-delusions
that a certain authorial smugness creeps into his narration: as a
result the reader can come away feeling superior to his characters,
irritated with their solipsistic mind games and self-inflicted
wounds.

HIGH TECH LEADER WITH PRAGMATIC OUTLOOK 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Mass.) (nk) 
 By CLAUDIA DREIFUS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In eight books, Dr. Michael L. Dertouzos _ engineer, inventor,
theoretician and director of the Laboratory for Computer Science at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology _ predicted the many ways
the information revolution would affect human lives.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, he forecast that one-third of all American homes
would soon have personal computers. In 1980, he announced the
coming of a worldwide Internet culture. Indeed, it was under
Dertouzos' directorship of the Laboratory for Computer Science that
Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   So what is he thinking about now? Over cups of hot tea, in his
Cambridge office, he offers some hints.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You recently gave a deposition in the Microsoft antitrust
suit. How does your old friend Bill Gates feel about the testimony
you offered?
</P>
<P>
   A. I suspect he may be a little disappointed. I was asked in my
testimony, ``Are browsers part of the operating system or
applications?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, browsers are applications,'' I answered. ``Tomorrow,
they will be merged.'' That was the point where Bill and I didn't
see eye to eye. The Microsoft position is they've already merged.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Was it hard for you to decide to testify in the Microsoft
case? MIT has received a $20 million gift from Bill and Melinda
Gates. He's also a friend of yours.
</P>
<P>
   A. When the Microsoft lawyers first called me, I said no. And
then Bill said, ``All I want you to do is testify on what you have
written.'' So then I said, ``All right, Bill, no money in expert
witness fees, no prepping by Microsoft lawyers, and I will only
testify on the merger of the browsers and operating systems.'' I
gave a six-hour deposition. After that, Microsoft dropped me as a
witness.
</P>
<P>
   Q. When you gave that deposition, you also said that you
differed with Gates on the effect of the computer revolution on the
rich and the poor. What did you mean?
</P>
<P>
   A. We differ on that and on some of his views on ``frictionless
capitalism.'' He thinks consumers and suppliers are going to meet
on this gigantic football field called the Internet and they are
going to do deals together without an intermediary. It's a
seductive idea.
</P>
<P>
   In my opinion, it is right for about 15 percent of the
marketplace. But wrong for 85 percent. It will happen on standard
products and products that do not involve trust questions _
relatively small products.
</P>
<P>
   Bill sees this expanding world of networking as an opportunity
for poor people to sell their wares, get educated, participate in
the world marketplace and pull themselves up from poverty. I see
the exact same thing with a time scale of 15 years _ and ONLY, if
we help.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How did you arrive at a 15-year year time frame?
</P>
<P>
   A. I learned it from Nepal. A while ago, I had this naive
assumption that I could go to Nepal, obtain computers and training
for the Nepalese and get them to have a 20 percent jolt in the GNP.
</P>
<P>
   But here's what I found out: Only 30 percent of the Nepalese are
literate. Of that 30 percent, only 10 percent speak English. Even
if I got someone to provide every one of them with a computer with
communications, what could they do with them? They have no skills
to sell.
</P>
<P>
   To get people to do this, I would have to educate them, and
people don't get educated overnight. So, 15 years. From this and
other experiences, I've concluded that the information revolution,
if left to its own devices, will mean that the rich are going to
buy more computers, be more productive and become richer, and the
poor will not be able to do that and will stand still.
</P>
<P>
   History teaches us that whenever the gap between rich and poor
increases, we have all kinds of troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Q. On a slightly different subject, ``wire up the schools'' has
become the latest solve-all slogan that politicians offer in their
campaigns. Does it seem a little mindless to you?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. Last year I was at a conference with Benjamin Netanyahu,
then prime minister of Israel, and he announced: ``I want to
connect all toddlers in my country. I have 300,00 toddlers under 5
and I want to connect them, but I'm having troubling finding the
money.'' I said, ``Mr. Netanyahu, why do you want to do that?'' He
said, ``Isn't it obvious?'' My position is: Let's experiment, let's
connect a few thousand kids, let's not deploy this for tens of
millions because the jury is still out.
</P>
<P>
   It is good for some things _ like training people in skiing and
tank-driving. But the bottom line is that we in America have all
the computers in the universe and we still rank 18th in math and
physics worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What have you noticed about the way politicians seize on
issues dealing with technology?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. That they haven't matured yet. The trend is still, ``This is
modern _ it is evidently good.'' They don't worry about other
things concerning technology _ for instance, privacy issues.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in the United States, every time you do a
transaction, you are asked for information and you have no control
over what will happen to it. You are, in fact, commoditizing your
privacy in return for the instant gratification of getting some
goods. It means that a lot of things about you will be known. I'd
like to see legislators debating these issues instead of
grandstanding and saying ``wire all schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Q. Speaking of Internet shopping, have you used Ebay?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, I've played at bidding. I was experimenting. I wanted to
see the elasticity of the bidding. I just pushed a poor woman up on
her bid on a rare Tennyson book. I bid it up another hundred
dollars and pulled out at the last minute. It wasn't a nice thing
to do, but I was trying to see how responsive the medium is.
</P>
<P>
   Q. There's been a nut fringe that went crazy at millennium. Why
is it this time so focused on technology with Y2K?
</P>
<P>
   A. You gave your answer by asking your question. It is in the
nature of human beings _ to go crazy about potentially apocalyptic
events that have no basis in rationality. Now, Y2K is a fully
rational bug. We know it's going to be trouble. So now we have the
apocalyptic tendency of human beings, with a real bug that could
hurt a lot of things. I take the position that, yes, we are going
to have a few bad cases, but the bulk of it is going to be mostly a
nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   The minute I took this position, I heard from a large number of
people who said, ``How can you say this _ the world is coming to an
end!''
</P>
<P>
   Q. If you had the power to redesign the curriculum of an
engineering school, how would you change it?
</P>
<P>
   A. I would make it a lot more sensitive to the whole human
being. So I would study more some of the seminal key aspects of
human activity _ historical, political, psychological. For example,
I would take key issues that we're facing today, for instance
privacy, and say, ``Where else have we had problems in privacy
before?'' I would take a situation in technology in which loyalty
comes in conflict with the truth and see how it plays out. Should
you tell the truth or be loyal to a friend or hide it?
</P>
<P>
   Q. Was that the dilemma you faced when you gave a deposition in
the Microsoft case?
</P>
<P>
   A. No, I wasn't torn at all. Nobody is going to make me say
something that I don't think is true. So I was really never torn. I
do value money and loyalty, but in any business the biggest capital
we have is sticking to our guns.'
</P>
<P>
   Q. You grew up in Athens, in the 1940s and 50s, where your
father was an admiral in the Greek navy. During those years, did
you ever dream you'd become a priest at this temple of high tech?
</P>
<P>
   A. No, but I went to a Greek-American school. So I was imbued
with high tech. By the time I was 13, I was reading the books of
people who work at this institution. I was riding bicycles with
sails on them. And I built a radio station. I absolutely related to
America. I believe I'm a mixture of both worlds, and I'm absolutely
comfortable in both.

SCIENCE Q&AMP;A: HELLO, OUT THERE! 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By C. CLAIBORNE RAY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. In the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) what
kinds of signals would be considered evidence of transmission by
intelligent life? How would scientists respond?
</P>
<P>
   A. Such a transmission might take many forms, but would probably
encode mathematical formulas. The reply would depend on the
content; it would not be made by scientists, but would come after
extensive international consultation.
</P>
<P>
   As for verification, according to statements on the SETI
Institute's Web site, www.seti.org, ``The main feature
distinguishing signals produced by a transmitter from those
produced by natural processes is their spectral width,'' that is,
how much room on the radio dial they take up. As far as scientists
know, any signal less than about 300 hertz wide is artificially
produced.
</P>
<P>
   Other telltale characteristics might be coded information, like
the message beamed from the Arecibo telescope in 1974, which
included data like the senders' location (third rock from the Sun,
in the case of Earth). Another important test would be a confirming
observation of the same signal at another radio telescope.
</P>
<P>
   Once confirmed, the discovery would be announced based on a plan
set up by six international space agencies. First, the scientific
community would be notified through the International Astronomical
Union and the United Nations. Then international authorities would
draft a reply.

 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Youth triumphed at the Metropolitan Opera House on
Saturday when the Kirov Ballet presented two performances of
``Giselle,'' with Maya Dumchenko, a rising star in the Russian
company, in the title role in the afternoon and Natalya Sologub, a
junior corps dancer, taking on the role in the evening. This was
dancing whose ravishing simplicity and clarity captured the essence
of the somewhat stylized Kirov production and of the company's
style in general.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dumchenko's Giselle and Andrian Fadeyev's Albrecht were
innocent children lost in a situation beyond their control in a
strongly danced first act. But there was a great deal more to Ms.
Dumchenko's layered, pristine performance, which achieved its
effects through dancing alone.
</P>
<P>
   Revealingly, there was no released, cascading hair in the mad
scene, a startling break with tradition. Ms. Dumchenko did not need
that dramatic touch. In a gradually building performance, she
subtly foreshadowed what was to come in the next act. This was a
Giselle who almost unnoticeably led a somewhat passive Albrecht
through their first-act tragedy, much as she would later save him
from death at the hands of the vengeful, ghostly wili maidens. Ms.
Dumchenko's delicately expressive arms seldom etched a shape but
seemed to evaporate, like graveyard mist, as a gesture peaked.
</P>
<P>
   Her mad scene was filled with suggestions of near-death
exhaustion: a torso that tilted as if needing to be cradled, a
sinking into the ground as soft as a sigh. That delicacy continued
in the second act. Disembodied-looking turns fluttered rather than
spun through their unerring course. Arabesques bloomed spaciously
rather than striking a shape.
</P>
<P>
   There was a fascinating unquiet to the imperceptible changes in
pacing in her dancing here. Small touches in the characterization
of Fadeyev, who had danced as Albrecht earlier last week, softened
all this into something closer to human emotion, most notably when
he follows the airborne Giselle with his arms moving like wings in
attempted flight.
</P>
<P>
   In the evening performance Ms. Sologub was an almost too-knowing
mortal Giselle. Vyacheslav Samodurov, replacing the injured Farukh
Ruzimatov, opted for the interpretation of Albrecht as a worldly
cad, which made for little needed contrast in a rather dull first
act. But Ms. Sologub more than made up for that as the spirit
Giselle, in dancing that mixed slow measure with an almost wild
abandon.
</P>
<P>
   This was more the eery wraith than the lovingly redemptive
spirit of 19th-century ballet legend, a quality expressed in purely
physical terms. One will not soon forget, for instance, the
slightly fugitive right foot in Ms. Sologub's unearthly sautes
passes or hopping jumps backward. Samodurov might be forgiven for
looking merely polished in his dancing and sensitive in his
partnering in the face of all this mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Anton Korsakov, a teen-age corps dancer who has become a New
York audience favorite, stood out for the ease and classical
fluency of his beautifully finished dancing in the first-act pas de
deux, performed with an impressively centered, delicate Yuliya
Kasenkova at the matinee and with Irina Zhelonkina in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   This production's intriguingly natty Hilarion was danced by Ilya
Kuznetsov (at the matinee) and Nikolai Godunov (in the evening).
The compelling lead casts were completed in the afternoon by
Tatyana Amosova as Myrtha, Veronica Part as Moyna and Dariya
Pavlenko as Zulma and Elvira Tarasova, Sofiya Gumerova and Ms.
Pavlenko in the evening. Boris Gruzin conducted.

   PHOENIX - In 20 years, Hugh Downs plans to give his wife, Ruth,
a gift of diamonds for their 75th wedding anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   On their 100th, he says, he'll fly her to the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Green cheese is about the only thing the veteran journalist
hasn't tried during 60 years of broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   In a stellar career that began before the age of television,
Downs has reported from the North Pole and the South Pole and
broadcast from the Battleship Missouri. He swam with a school of
great white sharks and allowed TV cameras to film his knee
replacement operation.
</P>
<P>
   He has written nine books.
</P>
<P>
   He interviewed the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. (``I realized he
was not working for the Black race but for the human race'') and
British physicist Steven Hawking (``He's considered as smart as
Einstein'').
</P>
<P>
   He has hosted game shows and talk shows and morning shows,
``Live from Lincoln Center'' and prime-time TV news magazine
``20/20.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, he holds the Guinness record for most hours logged on
network commercial television.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Downs belongs to the people.
</P>
<P>
   But it's Ruth Downs who will enjoy the lion's share of his time
when her husband of 55 years retires from regular broadcasting this
fall, disengaging from co-anchor Barbara Walters after two decades
of ``20/20'' _ the team that saved the ABC news magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement is a relative term.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's bringing his assistant out here, so I know he doesn't
intend to do nothing,'' Ruth says with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here'' is Arizona. After owning homes in Carefree and
Scottsdale, the couple are relinquishing all of their houses from
New York to the Mediterranean and building a new one in Paradise
Valley. It should be completed by October, when Downs officially
leaves the air.
</P>
<P>
   Helping to spark the move is his entry into the world of
academia as Arizona State University in Tempe upgrades its
communications department and christens it the Hugh Downs School of
Human Communication.
</P>
<P>
   Valley of the Sun philanthropist Jeanne Herberger instigated the
naming of the school after her longtime friend, believing ``his
profile lends itself to the naming of the school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His philosophy is more in tune with human communications
rather than as a newscaster,'' she says. ``His interests are broad
_ in space, in how we communicate.''
</P>
<P>
   Herberger first became acquainted with Downs when he served on
the board of the Phoenix Symphony, one of her pet projects. They've
been friends ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a friend of his, you're a friend forever,'' she
says. ``He's a special person to have in your life. He'll be a
leader in our community.''
</P>
<P>
   Herberger broached the idea with Downs several years ago, and
earlier this year, ASU President Lattie Coor popped the question
over lunch. Downs was flattered and paused only to consider how he
could best accommodate the responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have great respect for the university, but I want to fit it
into my life,'' Downs says as he and Ruth share a smoked salmon
pizza at the Ritz-Carlton bistro in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Not wishing to simply lend his name to the school, he pondered
the offer for a month before accepting. Now, he intends to be more
than an absentee benefactor, lecturing occasionally _ as he did in
1972 _ and auditing classes himself.
</P>
<P>
   The honor puts Downs in the same league as another famous
broadcaster _ longtime pal Walter Cronkite, whose name is on ASU's
school of journalism and telecommunications. Cronkite and Downs
once vied to be the first Journalist in Space, an ambition cut
short when the first Schoolteacher in Space, Christa McAuliffe,
lost her life in the Challenger disaster. &QL; 
Ohio native  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of former astronaut and Sen. John Glenn,
civilians have not been invited to fly in space since.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, by the way, is also a buddy of Downs. They're both 78 and
natives of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Although Downs once trained for space flight, experiencing 36
minutes of weightlessness, most of his assignments have been more
down to earth.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a homemaker/schoolteacher and a tire and battery
salesman, Downs graduated from high school in Lima, Ohio, in 1938,
winning a scholarship to a small liberal-arts school, Bluffton
College in Bluffton, Ohio. After a stint in the Army that saw no
battle and a couple of radio jobs, he landed a job as a staff
announcer for WWJ in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The producer on his weekly show was a comely young woman named
Ruth Shaheen. It was not love at first sight, they agree.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine now that this gracious, soft-spoken man was
something of a rogue in his younger days _ imbibing, carousing,
eating poorly, smoking two packs a day, showing up for work
bleary-eyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the normal human condition was to feel bad,'' he
says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Is this the venerable host of ``Concentration'' and ``Today,''
sidekick on Jack Paar's ``Tonight'' show, one of the two most
trusted men in broadcasting?
</P>
<P>
   Believe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it wasn't confined to Friday nights,'' he confesses.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the phlegmatic Scotch Irishman became attracted to the
lively young woman from Illinois who remembers when Ronald Reagan's
mother was her baby-sitter.
</P>
<P>
   Engaged to another girl, Downs made a bold move _ drove to his
girlfriend's house, broke off the engagement (she heaved his ring
at him) and dashed back to propose to Ruth, buying out a florist's
wares on the way.
</P>
<P>
   To his dismay, she didn't say yes. But she didn't say no either,
and eventually they became de facto engaged, then married in
February 1944. They now have two grown children, one who lives in
Santa Fe and one in the Berkeley area.
</P>
<P>
   The couple moved to New York in 1957 when Downs teamed with Paar
on NBC's late-night show and then hosted the network's ``Today''
show from 1962 to 1971. That's when the Downses began spending more
time in Arizona and ``learned to laugh at people who would leave in
April because of the terrible heat,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Once they settle in Paradise Valley, they'll endure the terrible
heat along with their neighbors, minus the occasional summer
vacation on the Aegean and visits to their children.
</P>
<P>
   From 1971 to 1977, Downs took a break from regular broadcast
appearances, although in 1976 he hosted a public-television series
on aging called ``Over Easy.'' He also worked for a California
think tank and headed the National Space Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The genial journalist couldn't stay away from television for
long. When ABC's fledgling news magazine ``20/20'' flopped after
its 1978 debut, hosted by two unknowns, then-network news President
Roone Arledge phoned the tried-and-true Downs, who had been filling
in for David Hartman at ``Good Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   Arledge sent up an SOS _ save our show.
</P>
<P>
   Downs was not at all reluctant to abandon his early-morning
wake-up call: ``I remembered why I had quit the ``Today'' show.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   However, he didn't expect to stay at ``20/20'' for 20 years. He
and Ruth reserved a room at New York's Regency Hotel for two weeks
and ended up living there for 18 months as the popularity of
``20/20'' grew under Downs' capable helmsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought if we lasted five years we'd be lucky,'' he says,
``and then I thought if we lasted 10 years . . .
</P>
<P>
   Downs hosted the show solo until 1984, then welcomed Barbara
Walters when news teams became trendy. She's still there, too,
bagging the celebrity interviews while her co-host goes off on his
adventures _ such as helping scientists in 1982 move the geographic
center of the South Pole to its proper position and marking it with
a tattered green flag.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a rich career, and we will read all about it as Downs
gathers material for an eventual memoir. His assistant, not Downs,
has been keeping notes all these years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a methodical person,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Downs' memorabilia is housed at the University of
Wyoming, which boasts an impressive archives department. Other
souvenirs of a life on the edge of history were lost several years
ago when a plumbing leak flooded his Carefree home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was almost apologetic,'' he says of his bequest to the
University of Wyoming. ``I had such a mound of junk.''
</P>
<P>
   His own college education has been motley _ a little Bluffton, a
little Wayne State University, some classes in gerontology at
Hunter College and New York's Mount Sinai Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, ASU awarded him an honorary doctorate.
</P>
<P>
   Downs had been considering retirement since signing his last
contract three years ago. That runs out in October, although he
might leave sooner. His choice of a replacement would be ABC's Tom
Jarriel.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement will not be a time of leisure, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Golf?
</P>
<P>
   ``I only play golf when someone is a guest at my house and wants
to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Downs is hoping to have more of her husband to herself _
far from the broadcast studio, far from the golf links, far from
historic figures, closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   Downs appears ready for a new phase in his life, agreeing he's
done just about everything.
</P>
<P>
   Except, ``I haven't gone to the moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Check back in 45 years. &QL;

NEW FIGHT OVER THE OLD ART OF DRUG COMPOUNDING 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(HLW) 
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A generation ago, when people took prescriptions to the local
drugstore, there was a good chance that the pharmacist, rather than
just pulling a prepackaged item off the shelf, would actually mix
and measure ingredients to fill capsules or create ointments or
cough syrup.
</P>
<P>
   Although that practice, ``compounding,'' has largely given way
to ready-made products, it is still used to prepare individual
prescriptions for people who need something not commercially
available. They may be allergic to a preservative or dye in a
certain medication, for instance, or need a dose or a drug mixture
that is not mass-produced.
</P>
<P>
   Some drugstores, calling themselves compounding pharmacies,
specialize in filling such prescriptions, and a trade group, the
International Academy of Compounding Pharmacists, based in Houston,
has 1,300 members in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But compounding seemed to take on a new meaning last week, when
advocates for people with hepatitis C announced that a pharmacy in
Pittsburgh could save customers a lot of money _ as much as $900 a
month _ on an expensive medication, Ribavirin, by compounding it
into capsules from bulk powder instead of buying the finished
capsules from the manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement seemed to take officials of the Food and Drug
Administration by surprise, coming as they were trying to develop
new rules to keep compounding within certain limits. Officials say
they are trying to keep compounding, meant to make small amounts of
medicine for individual patients, from crossing the line to
large-scale manufacturing. In addition, some compounded medicines
are essentially new drugs that have not been proved or tested, and
FDA officials say they are trying to find ways to protect people
from unsafe concoctions.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding exists in a gray zone of government regulation,
though, and even as the FDA works on new rules, concerns have been
raised that some pharmacies may already be stretching the
definition of compounding too far. And some pharmacies have
challenged the drug agency's authority to control them. Last
November, a group of compounding pharmacies sued the agency in
federal district court in Nevada, and won a temporary restraining
order saying that the agency could not stop stores from advertising
specific compounded products.
</P>
<P>
   Patients may have been delighted by last week's announcement
about Ribavirin, but the company that markets the drug, the
Schering-Plough Corp., of Madison, N.J., was not pleased at the
prospect of losing customers to a compounding pharmacy, Fisher's
Specialty Pharmacy Services, in Pittsburgh. Pharmacists at the
store said that on July 9, when Schering-Plough's patent on using
Ribavirin to treat hepatitis C runs out, they would buy the drug in
powder form from another source and pack it into capsules to fill
prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Stein, a pharmacist at Fisher's, said that although
Schering-Plough still has patent rights that prevent manufacturers
from marketing generic forms of Ribavirin, those rules do not apply
to compounding pharmacies. A spokeswoman for the compounding
pharmacies' trade group said that other drugstores would follow
Fisher's example.
</P>
<P>
   But Schering-Plough, which took in $214 million from Ribavirin
during the last year, issued a statement suggesting that the
compounders were violating its rights.
</P>
<P>
   FDA officials said that they were looking into the case to
determine whether any rules were being broken but that they
probably would not stop the compounding pharmacies unless the drug
they dispensed turned out to be unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stein said that Fisher's staff would be standing by at the
store on July 9, waiting to fill orders. ``We'll be up late,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1997, compounding was technically illegal, because it
often created drugs not approved by the FDA. However, recognizing
that some patients had needs that only compounding could address,
the drug agency looked the other way, exercising what officials
call ``enforcement discretion.''
</P>
<P>
   But in 1997, Congress passed the FDA Modernization Act, which
includes provisions meant both to protect compounding and to help
regulate it. The act exempts compounding from FDA rules for new
drugs, as long as the practice meets certain conditions. For
instance, compounded products must be prescribed by a doctor and
made for individual patients. Ingredients must be either approved
by the FDA, or on a special list of unapproved substances that are
allowed nonetheless. Pharmacies may not solicit prescriptions. Also
the act says that products that are essentially copies of
commercially available drugs may not be compounded ``regularly or
in inordinate amounts.'' But regularly and inordinate have not yet
been defined.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA has an advisory committee on compounding, headed by Dr.
Randy P. Juhl. The committee has met twice to develop rules on
compounding, in October and May. At the first meeting, Juhl
described compounding as an ``ancient art,'' and said it could be
of great value to people who cannot use available products.
</P>
<P>
   But he also noted a downside, telling the committee, ``There in
the past have been drug products and drugs of questionable quality
and safety, and there have been some who have hidden behind the
guise of pharmacy compounding to conduct what amounts to
large-scale manufacturing.''
</P>
<P>
   Jane Axelrad, a lawyer who is director of the FDA's regulatory
policy staff, told the committee that in one case, a business
``compounded'' more than 300,000 doses a month of commercially
available asthma medicines for 6,000 patients in various states.
</P>
<P>
   ``These patients were exposed to the risks of an unapproved new
drug manufactured without ordinary pharmaceutical quality controls
when an approved product was available,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, Ms. Axelrad said, a company with a pharmacy
license stockpiled hundreds of bulk ingredients for compounding,
but some were more than a year old, and 11 were undated, so it was
impossible to tell whether they had expired.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Larry Sasich, a pharmacist who works for Public Citizen
Health Research Group, a consumer organization, said the 1997
provisions on compounding had weakened the laws that should protect
consumers by creating a loophole for unapproved substances created
by pharmacists.
</P>
<P>
   But Bruce Roberts, a pharmacist from Leesburg, Va., painted a
different picture of compounding, describing a case that he said
was typical of his work with cancer patients. He said a home nurse
had telephoned him at 2 a.m., desperate because her patient, a
woman with bone cancer, was suffering from intense pain. The
patient also had severe nausea, from the high doses of morphine
that had already been tried.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts went to his store, selected six drugs to control pain
and nausea and blended them into rectal suppositories. The formula
worked, freeing the patient of pain and nausea for the next few
weeks, which was all that remained of her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is what compounding pharmacists and compounding can do to
make a difference in people's lives,'' Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   FDA officials said that they did not know when new rules on
compounding would be made final but that the agency had already
received several thousand comments on it.

WITH CENTERPIECE IN PLACE, LINCOLN CENTER FESTIVAL DIRECTOR IS
`EXTRAORDINARILY RELAXED'  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: S.C., Conn., Italy, Minn. Pa., N.Mex., Cyprus)   By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The day after his appointment as director of the
Lincoln Center Festival was reported last year, Nigel Redden got a
phone call at 4:30 in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   There was a bit of a problem, it seemed, with the festival's
featured performance, the 20-hour Chinese opera ``The Peony
Pavilion.'' As he soon learned, there was enough of a problem to
cancel the production a week or so before it was scheduled to
begin, something not quite on the level of putting on a wedding
without bride or groom but a pretty sizable torpedo in the hull of
a fully scheduled arts festival.
</P>
<P>
   Both Redden and ``The Peony Pavilion'' are back for a second
shot at it, and if putting on 113 performances of 34 productions in
18 days would seem daunting to most people, last year's experience
seems to have left him with an odd sense of serenity about his
first full year of planning and presenting the festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to last year, this feels extraordinarily relaxed,''
Redden said as a paper Chinese doll used in the performance
glowered above him on an upper shelf in his office. ``By the time
last year's festival came around, I'd been spending 12 days in
China, spending the days working there and the nights talking to
people here, so by the end, I was one of the walking wounded. We
have our problems, but they don't compare to what happened last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Most conspicuous at this year's festival, which starts Wednesday
and runs through July 25, will be ``The Peony Pavilion,'' the world
premiere of a production of all 55 scenes of the epic kunqu opera
directed by Chen Shi-Zheng. Other highlights include House Full o'
Praise, a nine-concert overview of African-American gospel music;
four programs honoring the composer Steve Reich; the world premiere
of a work by Robert Wilson, ``The Days Before: Death, Destruction
and Detroit III;'' a series of plays by the Irish dramatist Brian
Friel; dance programs devoted to the work of Merce Cunningham; the
Nederlands Dans Theater's American premiere of Jiri Kylian's ``One
of a Kind,'' and Kayassine, a French trapeze spectacle featuring 12
aerialists.
</P>
<P>
   If festivalgoers will also get some clues about where Redden
plans to take the four-year-old festival and how he plans to pull
off one of the more taxing balancing acts around, putting on both
the Lincoln Center Festival in the summer and the Spoleto Festival
U.S.A. in Charleston, S.C., each spring.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Redden, 48, has been doing a fair amount of
balancing for most of his professional life. Born in Cyprus, the
son of American diplomats, he has spent most of his career throwing
together elements as disparate as Chinese opera and American gospel
at festivals in the United States and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the unifying thread is festivals,'' he said. ``I've
probably worked at as many as anyone I can think of. And ever since
I first worked as an interpreter at Spoleto in Italy at the age of
18, what I've always found extraordinary is the juxtaposition of
things that are quite separate and distinct and how that leads to
personal connections that are extremely evocative and intuitive.
It's a very valuable way to look at a piece of art.''
</P>
<P>
   Redden studied art history at Yale. Since he graduated in 1972,
he has worked with Harvey Lichtenstein at the Brooklyn Academy of
Music, at La Mama in Manhattan, at Spoleto in Italy and its
offspring Spoleto U.S.A., and at places as diverse as the National
Endowment for the Arts, the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, the
Santa Fe Opera and the American Music Theater Festival in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   He was general manger of Spoleto U.S.A. from 1986 to 1991, when
he left after a dispute with the festival's organizer, Gian Carlo
Menotti. He helped start the Lincoln Center Festival in 1994 as a
consultant and returned to Spoleto as general director after
Menotti left. Redden returned to Lincoln Center as artistic
director in January 1998 after John Rockwell, the initial festival
director, was appointed editor of the Arts &AMP; Leisure section of The
New York Times. Redden was named director of the festival on June
16 last year.
</P>
<P>
   He said the two festivals were so different that running both at
the same time posed less of a conflict than it might seem.
``They're very different festivals,'' he said. ``Charleston is a
small town of 75,000 people, and in some ways the festival creates
its own context. The performances envelop the town in a way Lincoln
Center cannot envelop New York. There have been times when I've
wished some things could be done at each of them, and if something
works for both places, great, we'll do it at both places if we
can.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoleto, he said, is more intimate and strives for both variety
and works that speak to Charleston's history, particularly its
place in African-American history. His goal for the Lincoln Center
Festival, he said, is to present ambitious works, often on a grand
scale _ ``Peony Pavilion'' being a good example _ that would not
otherwise be seen in New York.
</P>
<P>
   He does not want ``Peony Pavilion'' to dominate the festival and
says he doesn't think it will. Still, it is hard not to focus on
the opera, which was canceled last year when Chinese officials
balked at Chen's production, calling it ``feudal, absurd and
pornographic in a way that is unacceptable to Chinese viewers and
artists.''
</P>
<P>
   The work will be performed in what are called marathon weekends
throughout the festival, with viewers able to buy tickets for
individual episodes or for all six episodes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will surprise a lot of people,'' he said. ``There
are people who think of Chinese opera as grating and difficult to
listen to, somehow unpleasant, but in fact kunqu opera and music is
much easier on the Western ear than Peking opera. It's surprisingly
lyrical, and the production is sumptuous. We had to design the
festival as if `Peony Pavilion' was not going to happen, so I think
it's first-rate without it, but I'm certainly glad we're able to do
it this year.''
</P>
<P>
   As diverse as the different parts of the festival are, what
unites many of them this year, he said, is what they say about the
history of artistic forms and references. Thus, the gospel
offerings reflect an American tradition that is a revealing
contrast to the Chinese one. ``The Cave,'' a collaboration by Reich
and the video artist Beryl Korot, who are married, reworks the
Biblical story of Abraham. One of Redden's favorites is ``Voila
Voila'' by the French-Vietnamese choreographer Ea Sola, which
reworks traditional Vietnamese dance forms in a modern context.
Redden presented a different Ea Sola work in Charleston in 1996.
There is much personal history too in the Merce Cunningham program
tied to his 80th birthday and the Brian Friel Festival, which
coincides with the playwright's 70th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``History informs a fair amount of what's going on in this
festival,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This year's fare tends toward challenging works. But he said
that was both the mandate of the festival and the kind of art he
was attracted to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the things we've demonstrated is that you can
do serious fare in the summer,'' he said. ``I'm not the right
person to do a summer pops festival. I wouldn't know where to
begin. But if these are serious works, I think they're works people
will enjoy. This isn't about taking medicine. It's about some of
the revelations that serious works of art can provide.''

   KOSOVO-RUSSIA (Washington) _ NATO and Russian military
commanders resolved their differences over Russia's role in the
peacekeeping operation in Kosovo today, clearing the way for 3,600

   DETECTIVE-POLITICS (Undated) _ Driven by an almost insatiable
demand for negative information in today's world of bruising
politics, private investigators are playing a larger _ though
mostly hidden _ role in the public arena, digging up dirt on
everyone from regulators to national and small-town officials.
President Clinton's use of detectives is widely known, but they
have also been used by the likes of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, Henry
J. Hyde and David N. Dinkins. The private investigators' reports
usually are aimed at discrediting critics and disposing of
opponents, but they are also used to identify and, if possible, to
fix potential embarrassments. Today's breed of investigators
include former police officers, as always, but also former FBI
agents, ex-CIA employees, former prosecutors and, in a trend that
raises new ethical questions, ex-journalists, who can tap old news
contacts to get negative information published. By Douglas Frantz.

   INDIA-PAKISTAN (Lahore, Pakistan) _ News Analysis: Once he gets
home from his Washington tete-a-tete with President Clinton, Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif is likely to find it difficult to deliver on
his assurance to the Americans that he will seek the withdraw of
Pakistani-backed forces from the Indian side of the cease-fire line
in the disputed territory of Kashmir. Sharif's sudden decision to
call on the president on Sunday and his commitment to take
``concrete steps'' to restore the cease-fire line were seen here,
not as a breakthrough that would help end a limited, undeclared war
between India and Pakistan, but as a sell-out of the Kashmiri cause
or another probably ill-fated move in a diplomatic game of chess.

   SCI-DOLPHIN-VIOLENCE (Undated) _ The image of the peaceful,

bloody clues, researchers have discovered that dolphins are far
from the happy, peaceful creatures humans think they know. Growing
evidence shows that the big animals are killing fellow mammals in
droves, wielding their beaks as clubs and slashing away with rows
of sharp teeth. Dolphins have been found to bludgeon porpoises to
death by the hundreds. Unlike most animal killers, which eat their

ANOTHER 20 QUESTIONS ABOUT ADVERTISING, MARKETING AND THE MEDIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's time again to ask 20 questions about advertising, marketing
and the media.
</P>
<P>
   _ Will a new print campaign for Tanqueray gin by Deutsch Inc.,
which features images of British icons like English bulldogs, Union
Jack flags and Prince of Wales plaid fabric, ever include a
beefeater?
</P>
<P>
   _ Would the Public Broadcasting Service raise more money during
its August pledge drive by showing a scheduled program called
``Lawrence Welk's Songs of Faith'' or by offering to keep it off
the air in exchange for generous donations?
</P>
<P>
   _ Now that Gateway Inc. is running commercials that feature the
song ``Who Are You'' by the Who, the Dell Computer Corp. is running
commercials using the song ``Magic Bus'' by the Who and the Nissan
Motor Corp. is running commercials featuring the song ``Won't Get
Fooled Again'' by the Who, will another marketer weigh in with the
album ``The Who Sell Out''?
</P>
<P>
   _ Was it a coincidence that an advertisement in the June 14
issue of People magazine for Everest Powerful Mint Gum, a new
product being sold by the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co., ran adjacent to an
article by Sir Edmund Hillary, the New Zealander who conquered
Mount Everest?
</P>
<P>
   _ Couldn't Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. have double-checked the media
plan for a radio campaign to promote a contest to give away trips
to the Women's National Basketball Association All-Star Game _ to
be played at Madison Square Garden July 14 _ so that the spots
describing how the prizes include ``airfare for four to New York''
would not have run on New York stations?
</P>
<P>
   _ Has a line from a commercial entered the vernacular faster
than ``Chicks dig the long ball,'' the phrase uttered by Atlanta
Braves pitcher Greg Maddux in a humorous spot by Wieden &AMP; Kennedy
for Nike?
</P>
<P>
   _ In ads for Yoplait yogurt, sold by General Mills, was it
really necessary for the slogan at the bottom of the page, ``C'est
si bon,'' to be followed by the English translation ``It is so
good''?
</P>
<P>
   _ Was anyone who attended the 46th International Advertising
Festival in Cannes, France, disappointed when they realized that a
news release announcing that ``Keith Richards will be jury
president'' actually meant to refer to Keith Reinhard, chairman and
chief executive at the DDB Worldwide Communications Group unit of
Omnicom Group?
</P>
<P>
   _ Couldn't the marketing geniuses at the Heinz Frozen Food Co.
or its parent, H.J. Heinz, have come up with a better brand name
for a product line than Bland Farms?
</P>
<P>
   _ Is Spring Hill Suites, a chain of all-suite hotels being
introduced by the Marriott Corp., an effort to capitalize on the
good feelings about Spring Hill, Tenn., that have been generated by
the popular campaign from Publicis &AMP; Hal Riney for the Saturn
division of the General Motors Corp.?
</P>
<P>
   _ And if that is the case, will Marriott open a Spring Hill
Suites hotel in Spring Hill?
</P>
<P>
   _ Did executives at Philip Morris worry that a print ad for
Virginia Slims _ showing a woman smoking in a bathtub surrounded by
scented candles under a headline that includes the word
``aromatherapy'' _ suggests that special efforts are required to
mask the stench of cigarette smoke?
</P>
<P>
   _ Wasn't it clever of Canon to run radio spots for its copiers
teasing efforts by the Xerox Corp. to protect the Xerox name, which
pretended to remind consumers that unauthorized use of the Xerox
trademark _ as in referring to copies as ``Xeroxes'' _ is
prohibited?
</P>
<P>
   _ Did DaimlerChrysler ask The Washington Post for a refund after
an ad for the E-Class Mercedes-Benz _ showing the front end of the
car under the headline ``Deer freeze in headlights. Apparently, so
do people'' _ ran in the same issue as an article about complaints
about new ``ultra-bright headlights'' on cars including
Mercedes-Benzes that began with the words ``This is what deer must
feel like''?
</P>
<P>
   _ Who will be the first business journalist to suggest that the
Campbell Soup Co., the Hershey Foods Corp. and the Kellogg Co. _
packaged-goods mainstays struggling with sluggish growth rates and
changing consumer tastes _ merge to form an advertising and
marketing powerhouse?
</P>
<P>
   _ Now that S.C. Johnson &AMP; Son has renamed the Dow Bathroom
Cleaner product line as Scrubbing Bubbles after the characters in
the brand's ads, will Diageo rename its Pillsbury frozen baked
goods after Poppin' Fresh and will the Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. rename
Charmin bathroom tissue after Mr. Whipple?
</P>
<P>
   _ Will the gibes about the prurient interest in lesbians among
straight men be renewed by a print ad showing two women in a
romantic embrace _ promoting Disaronno amaretto liqueur, imported
by the Bacardi-Martini USA unit of Bacardi Ltd. _ appearing in
Playboy magazine as well as in publications read by gay men and
lesbians?
</P>
<P>
   _ Now that Ikea has given the name Selling to a new area rug,
will shoppers ask clerks at Ikea stores ``Are you selling the
Selling?''
</P>
<P>
   _ And will the Ikea clerks respond by asking ``Will you be
buying the Selling, or are you just looking?''
</P>
<P>
   _ Will an adorable girl whose tongue has been taken over by the
Pepsi-Cola marketing department tell an advertising columnist in
the voice of Joe Pesci that ``you ask a lot of questions for
someone from Brooklyn''?

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The heat wave along the Atlantic Seaboard will reach its crest
Tuesday as a final push of torrid air from the Southwest precedes a
cool front. With abundant, though hazy sunshine, readings will rise
from near 80 degrees at sunrise to surpass 100 degrees by 3 p.m. in
many sections from southern New England to the Carolinas. Sultry
breezes will gust over 20 mph in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Very humid air returning to northern New England will encounter
a shallow cool air mass along the Maine coast. Another cluster of
thunderstorms will develop in the mountains as the advancing sticky
air is lifted. Clouds and scattered thundershowers will keep
readings below record levels across the interior Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing drier air will trigger scattered thunderstorms from
the eastern Great Lakes to the central Plains. One or two of the
storms will be potent with large hail and damaging winds. Much more
comfortable weather is expected from the Northern Plains to the
Middle West with sunny skies, but still above seasonal readings.
</P>
<P>
   The South will remain sultry. Several patches of thunderstorms
will erupt in the steamy air mass. A few storms will form over the
southern Appalachians with more storms likely where sea breezes
push well inland in Texas. Florida will notice only widely
separated storms.
</P>
<P>
   Afternoon storms will erupt over the southern Rockies. The
remainder of the West will be dry with cooler air reaching the
Northwest along with some clouds. The Southwest deserts will remain
hot.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: A Head Start
</P>
<P>
   Despite mostly clear skies and virtually calm winds, the
temperature only fell to 78 degrees at Harrisburg, Penn., at
daybreak on Monday. Large amounts of water vapor in the lower
atmosphere over the Northeast absorbed the heat being emitted from
the ground during Sunday night. This absorbed infrared energy was
then emitted back toward the surface, keeping temperatures
unusually high. The record nighttime minimums, such as
Harrisburg's, gave a boost to Monday's temperatures, sending values
over 100 degrees in some sections. Tuesday will feature a repeat
performance along the East Coast. &QL;

WHAT IF THE WALL OF SEPARATION BETWEEN CHURCH AND STATE FELL? 
</HEADLINE>

Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is

(gm) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   
 c. 1999 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the controversy over funding religious schools with tax
dollars heats up, some citizens are claiming that the concept of
``separation of church and state'' is only a myth. While it is true
that the phrase does not literally appear in the U.S. Constitution
or the Bill of Rights, the principle of the wall of separation is
imbedded in the two religious clauses of the First Amendment and
Article VI of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The First Amendment states, in part: ``Congress shall make no
law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the
free exercise thereof; ...'' The Establishment Clause means that
government cannot support or endorse one or all religions. It also
means that government must be neutral in regard to religion.
</P>
<P>
   The Free Exercise Clause means that the government should not
interfere with religious worship unless it has a compelling reason
to do so for public safety or because of societal mandates or laws.
The Free Exercise Clause does not protect human sacrifices, incest,
or polygamy as a part of religious worship.
</P>
<P>
   Article VI of the Constitution states, in part: ``no religious
test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or
public trust under the United States.'' This clause is a further
barrier to mixing church and state. It doesn't matter what a
person's religious beliefs are, that person can run for office. A
person's religious beliefs cannot be used to disqualify that person
from sitting on a jury.
</P>
<P>
   The Founders were well aware they were creating a secular state.
There is no mention of God or a Supreme Being in the Constitution
or in the Bill of Rights. The Founders and their parents and
grandparents had witnessed the persecution and civil unrest in
England and Europe because of unholy marriages between church and
state. The colonies became home to those who were escaping
religious persecution.
</P>
<P>
   The Founders knew the evil promulgated when government can
enforce religious doctrine or religious beliefs. The separation of
church and state was very much on their minds as they crafted our
Constitution and our Bill of Rights.
</P>
<P>
   The separation of powers is also a principle that isn't
literally named in the Constitution, but is implied by the very
structure of the Constitution. The document spells out the powers
of Congress, of the president, and of the courts. The phrase ``fair
trial'' cannot be found in the Constitution or the Bill of Rights,
but it is implied in those documents.
</P>
<P>
   But let us suppose for argument's sake that the principle of
separation of church and state does not exist, that it is an
erroneous reading of James Madison and Thomas Jefferson. What would
be the ramifications if that wall suddenly fell?
</P>
<P>
   Law professor Douglas Laycock of the University of Texas at
Austin, who is an expert in church-state law, said flatly that such
a supposition is a mistake, that it gives support for the recent
rhetoric that dismisses the principle of the separation of church
and state. That principle, he said, is imbedded in the religious
clauses of the First Amendment. ``Separation of church and state''
is merely the slogan for what those clauses mean.
</P>
<P>
   But, Laycock said, if you want to make the supposition, then put
it this way: ``Without separation you can't get to free exercise.
The government would be free to meddle and eliminate free exercise
for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans United for
Separation of Church and State, gave a list of ramifications that
would be the result of denying or eliminating the wall of
separation: Churches would vie for public money and it is likely
that minority religious groups would always lose in the
competition. Schools, businesses and public offices could start
their day with prayers of the majority religion. There could be a
renewal of the Bible riots that plagued our nation after the Civil
War. Blasphemy laws might be enacted and enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Rogers, associate general counsel of the Baptist Joint
Committee, added to the list. It is likely we would see violence
against minority religions, she said. Religious entities would then
be treated by the government in the same manner as any secular
organizations _ that is, there would be conditions tied to any
public funds given to churches; religious groups would have to hire
and fire according to federal law; religious organizations could
not discriminate based upon religion when hiring.
</P>
<P>
   Elliot Mincberg, legal director of People for the American Way,
summed it up this way: ``If the doctrine of separation of church
and state fell, religious freedom, religious practice would be much
less free.'' The autonomy of religion from state powers disappears,
he said. Government could promote religion. Some states could
endorse one religion and discriminate against others. Courts could
get involved with deciding church issues. He also noted that where
religion and state are bound together, there is religious conflict
_ as in Kosovo and Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Professor emeritus of humanities Robert Alley of the University
of Richmond, Va., speaking of the Bible riots in the 1800s, said:
``The ((separation)) principle in the First Amendment may have been
violated in the short run, but there it was, nevertheless, as a
guardian that righted the ship and now we don't have the kinds of
religious persecution that were fairly common in communities in the
19th century. I genuinely believe that without the First Amendment
interpreted in a strict way, this country would quickly find itself
in the throes of serious religious conflict between religious
groups. And that can only get worse as more and more different
religious groups take on the character of numbers sufficient to
have weight. We have a growing diversity. The First Amendment is
far more important to us now than it has been in any point in our
history. We've avoided what Europe has gone through, what's going
on in the Balkans right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwin Gaustad, professor emeritus of history at the University
of California at Riverside, was emphatic about what would happen if
the principle of separation of church and state were ignored: ``The
most horrifying but most obvious example is religious warfare _
because that was true of England in the 17th century, of the
continent in the 16th century. Any time you put the power of the
state, which is to say the power of the sword, behind conformity
and religion, you're calling for religious persecution, you're
calling for religious martyrdom, you're calling for religious
warfare. All you have to do is look at the history of the Western
world to find example after example after example. From our relaxed
point of view in 1999, we say, `Oh that could never happen.' But
the fact is it happened over and over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who argue that the wall of separation between church and
state has made us a godless nation ignore the reality. Our country
has a growing religious diversity, thousands of vital and active
religious groups, and a religious liberty on a scale never known
before in the history of humankind. We should be grateful to
Madison and Jefferson for the wall of separation that protects us
all.

   NORTHERN IRELAND: BLAIR CLARIFICATION
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to shore up wavering Protestant support for his
blueprint for setting up the new Northern Ireland government this
month, Prime Minister Tony Blair told the House of Commons that
Sinn Fein would have to give up its cabinet positions if its IRA
allies did not disarm on schedule. Blair issued the clarification
in a speech arguing that the plan, negotiated in Belfast last week,
was the best opportunity for peace this generation of Britons would
ever have.

   ITALY: A ROYAL APPEAL

<P>
   The son of Italy's last king, Victor Emmanuel, 62, says he will
appeal his status of forced exile from Italy to the European Court
of Human Rights in Strasbourg, saying that as a result of the ban
he was refused permission to enter Italy to hand over aid for
Kosovo refugees. Under the 1948 Constitution male heirs of the
House of Savoy are barred from Italian soil.

   The Interior Ministry has named Adm. Wilfrido Robledo to head

in January. The previous commissioner, Omar Fayad, served only 95
days before his transfer to become customs chief. The new force's
responsibilities remain unclear. In February Clinton administration
officials predicted that the new force would make a valuable

   In a speech before a bankers' group, President Carlos Saul Menem
proposed that the members of the Mercosur trade union _ Argentina,
Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay _ create a common currency to
consolidate ``the stability of the region and dispel the ghosts of
devaluation.'' He said the Argentina peso, the value of which is

   BRAZIL: TELEPHONE PROBLEMS
</P>
<P>
   Telephone service has been severely disrupted by the
introduction of competition to domestic long-distance service, with
fewer than one in four calls being successfully completed since a

which made normal communications between Sao Paulo and Rio de

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOSE Lima likes to consider himself an entertainer first,
baseball player second. So if there is a stage nearby, he usually
will find it.
</P>
<P>
   Just like the time on a humid April morning when he accompanied
Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr. and other corporate executives to a
naming ceremony for the club's new downtown ballpark, Enron Field,
slated to open next season. After the formal presentation, Lima
decided to get loose. With a luncheon crowd of 3,000 at his
disposal, Lima stole the show, hopping onto a nearby stage,
grabbing a microphone and singing the lyrics to La Bamba.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had them spellbound,'' McLane recalls. ``They were just
amazed. A lot of time an athlete's singing and dancing is so-so. He
had them in the palm of their hands with his warmth and charisma.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the time back in 1995 when he was a young pitcher
in Double-A for the Detroit Tigers. Lima had thrown a no-hitter,
and a week later a man approached him with a small request. His
5-year-old son was a big fan of Lima's, and the father invited him
to the birthday party. Lima attended the party.
</P>
<P>
   While there's an unwritten rule in baseball that starting
pitchers don't talk with reporters _ or anyone, for that matter _
before they take the mound, Lima will carry on a conversation with
anyone who'll listen. He is usually the first player signing
autographs and stays until the last fan is gone or he runs out of
ink. As manager Larry Dierker once said, ``If you don't have his
autograph, you haven't tried.''
</P>
<P>
   And he can always be found singing and holding his infant son,
Jose Jr., born last Fourth of July.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the baby cries he sings a song and the baby doesn't cry
anymore,'' said his wife, Melissa.
</P>
<P>
   He has been nicknamed the Mambo King, which is perfect for a guy
who pops his favorite compact disc into the stereo and shakes
across the clubhouse floor to the merengue beat. ``Parate a batear
que te voy a alimar.'' The words to the debut single off his second
CD, titled El Mambo de Lima, translate to ``Step up to the plate,
I'm going to strike you out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, this is a good life. I love to pitch, and I love to
sing,'' Lima says.
</P>
<P>
   He's threatening to top both charts.
</P>
<P>
   When Lima isn't putting the final touches on his CD, he is
making sweet music on the mound. By this time next week, the
26-year-old who is quickly becoming one of baseball's newest
sensations could be preparing for his biggest performance _ the
June 13 All-Star Game in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Quite a turnaround for a guy whose future was uncertain at the
start of last season. Before last season, Lima had a 9-22 career
record and the Astros were on the verge of releasing him. Since
then, he has been the most consistent member of the Astros'
rotation with a 27-12 record. He went 16-8 in his first season as a
full-time starter and carried the momentum over to this year,
becoming the league's first 11-game winner.
</P>
<P>
   He has the league's attention. Last year during a start against
Milwaukee, Lima allowed two runners to reach base with no outs. He
got the next two batters on strikeouts and ended the inning with a
groundout, pumping his fist and sidestepping off the mound in
jubilation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commissioner (Bud Selig) called me and asked, `Who is that
guy?''' McLane said.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball has given Lima and his family financial security, but
his love has always been his music. The oldest of seven children,
Lima began performing in nightclubs in the Dominican Republic at
age 11 and won his first competition at 13. He took music classes
for five years before eventually being signed by the Tigers in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played but I liked music better,'' Lima said.
</P>
<P>
   Lima says he might never have continued playing baseball if not
for his father, Francisco Rodriguez, a former player himself in the
Dominican amateur leagues. So he kept his father happy, playing in
fields and vacant lots around their neighborhood just outside the
city of Santiago before eventually joining a team in the Dominican
youth league.
</P>
<P>
   ``During his early teens people kept telling us that he was good
and we should encourage his talent,'' said his mother, Nurys Lima.
``His dad then began to encourage him and spend more time with him
and his baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Things have never been the same. Lima brought his act to the
United States and the big leagues. His seven years in the Detroit
organization were marked by one trial after another to prove he
could be a successful pitcher. He struggled to records of 5-11 and
8-13 during his first four years. He was part of the Tigers'
100-loss season in 1996, but not even that can be described as the
darkest time of his life.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Lima went through a divorce shortly after being traded
to the Astros in a 10-player swap, and his inability to get batters
out again had his future in limbo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through a lot of stuff. I went through a divorce, and
that was tough for me,'' Lima said. ``I didn't want to go to court
and be fighting. I got over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Before things got better, they would only get worse. Coming off
a 1-6 record in 1997, his first season with the Astros, Lima
struggled during spring training last year and did nothing to
convince management he was ready to take his career to the next
level.
</P>
<P>
   In one spring training exhibition, he gave up nine runs in three
innings against Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the worst days of my life,'' Lima said of the
eventual 15-0 loss. ``I almost got released. Do you think I'll ever
forget that day?''
</P>
<P>
   McLane sat in the stands with general manager Gerry Hunsicker
and team president Tal Smith shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought, `Geez, what in the world are we going to do with
Jose Lima?''' McLane said. ``We laugh about it now, but we were all
shaking our heads. Sometimes your best decisions are no
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Realizing that he could no longer rely solely on a 90-mph
fastball and lethal changeup to challenge hitters, Lima worked with
pitching coach Vern Ruhle and added a sinker and slider to his
repertoire. With the Astros' rotation unsettled because of injuries
to two starters, Lima walked into Dierker's office during spring
training and pleaded for an opportunity to start. In his first
start of '98, Lima held the Colorado Rockies to one run and four
hits in seven innings. By mid-May, he had become the NL's first
six-game winner.
</P>
<P>
   However, Lima has not been endearing to all who have played
against him. He has been the center of controversy during the past
year-and-a-half for his exuberant display of emotion following a
strikeout or good play. Milwaukee pitcher Steve Woodard called
Lima's showmanship ``the weakest act in baseball'' last year.
</P>
<P>
   Others have defended his emotional style, calling it refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a very talented and loyal guy,'' said Joe Klein, Lima's
agent. ``He's not showing anyone up. He just gets into it. He feels
blessed and doesn't take anything for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Why the sudden turnaround? Lima credits maturation and his
family for his change of fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's changed my whole life. It's the best thing to happen to a
person,'' Lima said. ``I think I'm blessed to have my wife Melissa
and my champion (Jose Jr.). It's amazing how your life can change
so quickly when you see another human being coming. My son changed
my whole life, and I have a great woman; she's the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Lima met his wife while on a road trip to Seattle in 1996.
Melissa had attended a Mariners game when Lima spotted her walking
to her car in the parking lot as he boarded the team bus. She asked
for an autograph. ``I was so embarrassed. I didn't know what to
say,'' Melissa said.
</P>
<P>
   The righthander has been featured in national publications
throughout the first half, has been a frequent guest on Jim Rome's
nationally syndicated radio show, and this week was part of a
segment on Houston couples on a local morning television show.
</P>
<P>
   But the increase in popularity hasn't changed the Lima's way of
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think about it. People ask, `That's your
husband, isn't that cool?''' said Melissa, who says her favorite
player is Randy Johnson from his days with the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   With all his success on the mound, Lima is hoping to become a
bigger hit on the music scene. He leads a 13-piece band called La
Fuga, or The Escape. Lima writes lyrics wherever he finds
inspiration, and some of his songs relate to baseball, like the new
cut La Gozadera or The Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to try and create my own stuff,'' Lima said. ``I'm
making some new songs that are going to be awesome. It's something
that just comes out of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Later this year, Lima and his family will move into their new
five-bedroom, two-story house near Pearland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to when I sign my big deal,'' he said. ``I
can take care of everybody. I've taken care of my whole family.
When I go back there, I let them know that no matter what, I'm
still their brother. Whatever they need from me I'm going to take
care of them.''
</P>
<P>
   He signed a one-year, $1.95 million contract that goes to $2.15
million if he makes 31 starts or pitches 215 innings. He could be
in line for an even bigger payoff next year as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having all the money hasn't changed who we are,'' Nurys Lima
said. ``Now we live differently because we didn't have as much and
now we pretty much have everything we ever wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Which means Lima can have the best of both worlds. &QL;

   BELA CRKVA, Yugoslavia _ This ruined little village buried its
dead Monday in a bitter, tearful ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Reburied them, actually.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty of the 64 people laid to their final rest on a sun-baked
hilltop had been hastily, furtively buried at night by other
villagers near where the victims were reportedly shot dead by
Serbian forces early on the morning of March 25, hours after the
NATO bombing began. The bodies of four other people who had been
killed elsewhere were also buried Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The well-documented account of a massacre here that day, along
with reports of other massacres in a chain of villages along the
main road running southeast from Djakovica, marked the beginning of
the violent Serbian campaign that seemed designed to purge Kosovo
of its Albanians, 90 percent of the province's population.

<P>
   The bodies of the victims in Bela Crkva (pronounced BELL-a
SER-ka) were carried from a makeshift morgue set up by war crimes
investigators in a winding caravan of farm tractors and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   It was a ceremony so emotional that the local custom banning
women from funerals was set aside by a village decision. And the
crowd of thousands was packed with weeping, wailing women in white
head scarves of mourning.
</P>
<P>
   For six days, Chief Superintendent John T. Bunn of Scotland Yard
had been digging up the first, rough graves. He was camped in a
white tent down a nearly impassable mud track in a field by a river
where villagers say most of the killings occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The ``crime scene,'' as Bunn called it, where the river runs
under a railroad bridge, is one of six murder sites listed by the
International War Crimes Tribunal in its indictment against
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and four of his top
associates for crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   The British detective climbed up the railroad embankment the
other day and pointed out a big trench where 32 bodies had been
exhumed and other, smaller graves among the bushes, trees and
hedges. He described how villagers had turned out to help and had
driven the bodies to the morgue in a procession of tractors.
</P>
<P>
   He finished his investigation for the war crimes tribunal on
Saturday evening and turned the bodies over to the villagers for
burial.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Bunn stood quietly to the rear of the ceremony with a
few of his team members and summed up his findings briefly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were 60 bodies, all shot,'' he said. ``There were seven
children under 12, including a 4-year-old. There were three women,
one over 60. They were killed in individual little groups along the
river. It was all quite deliberate.''
</P>
<P>
   Professionally, he said in a matter-of-fact tone, the
investigation had been ``quite satisfying.'' Then, with a bit more
emotion, he added that he was pleased that ``these people, whose
relatives have been shot and taken away from them, can grieve in a
proper fashion.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The day began with a line of tractors and trucks pulling up to
the makeshift morgue the British had set up in an empty warehouse
on the highway intersection at the village of Zrze.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies were taken out of the morgue in black plastic body
bags _ with evidence tags marked `'Metropolitan Police'' still
attached _ and loaded onto rough pine pallets, for Muslims are not
buried in coffins. A small red-and-black Albanian flag with a
double-headed eagle was placed on each body bag.
</P>
<P>
   The villagers gathered in the yard of the local school
throughout the morning. A line of men stretched along the fence at
the entrance, solemnly greeting each visitor with a right hand
across the chest, along with a short bow or a handshake.
</P>
<P>
   A group of older men _ local dignitaries, most wearing the
traditional white conical hat of the Albanian mountains _ sat on a
row of benches and desks from the school. Beside them, on lower
benches, was a row of children, each holding a framed photograph of
one or more of the dead, the kind of stiff, formal portraits people
put in their living rooms.
</P>
<P>
   As more and more people drifted in, wailing women clustered in
the shade of a row of trees, their cries splitting the air.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Like most villages here, Bela Crkva is a close-knit group of
extended families, where relationships run long and deep. The
printed list of victims contained 21 people with the family name of
Popaj and 24 with that of Zhuniqi, along with four from the Fetoshi
family and seven from the Spahiu family.
</P>
<P>
   Among the people gathered here Sunday was Isuf Zhenigi, who
first gave an account of the massacre to The New York Times in
April, describing how he had been saved by falling under the bodies
as men were machine-gunned into the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most terrible, black day I ever had,'' he said as
he looked around the mourners and the portraits of the dead people
he knew so well. He lost his uncle and 23 other relatives in the
massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had returned to the riverbank to see the scene of
the killings, Zhenigi, who had appeared composed, at first nodded.
Then, suddenly, he began crying, leaned against a building, then
slumped to the ground. Other men from the village squatted down
with him, patting his shoulder, giving him a cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my best friends were killed,'' he said finally. ``They
killed 12 children.''
</P>
<P>
   And the future? he was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I do?'' he said. ``I had two buses. They burned them.
I had a home. They destroyed it.'' Now, he said, he must figure out
how to provide for his family: ``I have two children. They are
sleeping in the yard.''
</P>
<P>
   At noon the procession of close relatives, carrying mourning
wreaths that are a custom here, began filing along the main dirt
road of the village, and the schoolyard emptied out as people
joined them.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The procession wound past the village's burned-out houses _
nearly every one destroyed _ and the mosque, scorched, its dome
full of holes, its minaret gone. Past the ruins, the throng of
mourners mounted a steep hill, known locally as Paskiddle.
</P>
<P>
   They were accompanied by a small honor guard of soldiers from
the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army in a mixture of camouflage
outfits, including six with Kalashnikov rifles with fixed bayonets.
</P>
<P>
   The group is no longer supposed to wear uniforms or carry guns,
under the peacekeeping agreement for Kosovo. German NATO troops on
the scene did not interfere, though, except _ briefly and
unsuccessfully _ to try to keep out foreign journalists.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Under a burning sun, the procession reached the crest of the
hill, and eight trucks and 11 tractors groaned into the field with
the bodies. The graves had already been dug, and a long process
began of unloading each body, the grave surrounded by mourners,
while thousands of other people sat silently around the hillside
and men of the village pushed dirt into the grave.
</P>
<P>
   The graves were marked with simple wooden stakes bearing the
name of the deceased and a birth date. Each stake also bore the
date 25-3-99.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the honor guard fired a volley of three bursts of
automatic weapons in honor of the dead, and the people of Bela
Crkva began drifting down the hill.
</P>
<P>
   Bunn, later in the afternoon, set up his white investigation
tent in the village of Celina, a few miles across the rolling hills
to the southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers there say they have 88 bodies.

BARAK, PUTTING OLD-TIMERS IN CABINET, CONSOLIDATES HIS POWER BASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds., 7th graf, in double parentheses, should be set in brackets) 
(HLW) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ By appointing loyal old-timers to two key posts in
his Cabinet and keeping a third for himself, Prime Minister-elect
Ehud Barak appeared on Monday to be trying to consolidate his hold
on power as he completed his government.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts here say that Barak, 57, a highly-decorated former
general, is acting very much like a military commander. He is
flanking himself with a foreign minister and a finance minister who
are not expected to challenge or overshadow him.
</P>
<P>
   While this could lead to a more disciplined, even accomplished
government, some believe that it also could portend an autocratic
leadership style for Barak, who will serve as his own defense
minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ehud Barak did not distribute senior portfolios to members of
his faction,'' Sima Kadmon, a political analyst, said in the daily
Yediot Ahronot on Monday. ``He cloned himself for all the major
roles.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Barak made appointments to key social
ministries _ Justice, Education and Interior _ that signal a clean
break with the past. They also hold a promise of democratic-minded
reform in institutions that deal with touchy issues, like the
religious-secular power struggle, the question of who is a Jew and
the future constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, after completing his ministerial appointments on Monday,
is expected to be sworn in with his Cabinet on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ((President Clinton, who was traveling in Kentucky on Monday,
briefly interrupted a tour of an electronics factory to speak to
Barak on the phone for about 12 minutes, a White House spokesman
said. But they did not set a date for Barak to visit Washington.))
</P>
<P>
   Barak faced his first defeat on Monday, a frustration to his
efforts to shore up his control. His party, One Israel, voted down
his hand-picked choice for the powerful role of speaker of
Parliament _ an obscure and inexperienced politician, Shalom
Simchon, who one analyst said was being set up to serve as Barak's
``suicidal Shiite soldier on the Parliament podium.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the party _ a reconstituted version of the old Labor _
selected an ambitious Labor Party veteran, Avraham Burg, who is
unlikely to be malleable. Yaron Ezrahi, a political scientist, said
that while it is too early to gauge how Barak will conduct himself,
the Cabinet appointments are telling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the Cabinet as Barak's business card,'' he said. ``It
tells us two things. First, that he takes very seriously his role
as leader of change. And second, in the ministries in which he
wants to have direct influence, that he has a strong tendency to
surround himself with people who are so loyal that they will not
get in his way.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak on Tuesday named Avraham Shochat, 63, of his own One
Israel Party to be finance minister for the second time,
disappointing much of the business sector.
</P>
<P>
   David Levy, 61, was appointed foreign minister for the third
time on Sunday, leaving professional diplomats somewhat
indifferent.
</P>
<P>
   Both men are considered somewhat outmoded in their fields, and
neither is considered likely to forge bold initiatives without
explicit direction from above.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When news of Shochat's appointment leaked out on Sunday, the Tel
Aviv stock exchange immediately dipped downward.
</P>
<P>
   This was a sign that many investors fear that his reputation as
a policy maker who would prefer to stimulate the economy with
government spending, expanding the deficit, rather than to continue
the departing government's increasingly successful battle against
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   His admirers, however, saw as positives the rapid growth rates
and surging foreign investments that characterized his previous
term. And Shochat, in brief comments on Monday, indicated that he
might pick up where he left off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to reassure the business community,'' Shochat said on
Monday, ``that we're going to pursue a very responsible policy that
will be good for the economy, a policy of growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on Monday, Barak named Yossi Beilin, a leftist political
scientist and one of the most independent thinkers in his party, to
be justice minister. A high-minded champion of civic culture,
Beilin will take over a Justice Ministry that was considered
tainted by the departing minister, Tsahi Hanegbi, who has been
under investigation for corruption.
</P>
<P>
   It also gives Beilin, who has worked hard to build a
relationship with the ultra-Orthodox, a key role in managing
relations between the judiciary and the religious sector. And he
will have a strong hand in shaping the evolving constitution _ a
very sensitive issue for the Orthodox.
</P>
<P>
   In another appointment of a progressive, Barak previously named
Yossi Sarid, leader of the leftist Meretz Party, to take over the
Education Ministry from the religious party that has been in
control.
</P>
<P>
   He also took the Interior Ministry, which handles delicate
issues involving citizenship and Jewish identity, from the
ultra-Orthodox Shas Party and gave it to Natan Sharanky, the
Russian immigrant leader.
</P>
<P>
   Barak on Monday appointed Shlomo Ben-Ami, an intellectual who
was the top vote-getter in the party's internal primaries, to be
internal security minister, in charge of the police. Ben-Ami is not
a law enforcement specialist; his strengths are foreign and social
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Some perceived this as an insult, but others believed that
Ben-Ami could make needed reforms in the police culture while
expanding his domain to include social issues like relations
between Israeli Arabs and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Shas will control the Religious Affairs, Health, Labor and
Welfare, and Infrastructure Ministries. And the settlers' party,
the National Religious Party, will run the Housing Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is facing severe criticism from women's groups. Although
he pledged to include more women in his government than any
previous leader, he ended up appointing only one _ Dalia Itzkik of
One Israel, who will be environment minister.
</P>
<P>
   Further, he appointed no Arab politicians as ministers or deputy
ministers, although Israeli Arab voters, a crucial bloc, supported
him nearly unanimously.
</P>
<P>
   Barak intends to expand his Cabinet of 18 members to 24 members
after taking office, so it is possible he will include more women
or an Arab at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, it seems likely that he has interpreted his resounding
election victory as a personal rather than a party mandate, and
that he is constructing a system that allows him maximum control.

PROGRAM HELPS WOMEN DEVELOP BASIC JOB SKILLS

   Judy Wells wants more.
</P>
<P>
   She has worked the last several years as a library assistant and
dreams of becoming an administrative assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get a better-paying job,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wells now feels ready to make that change. Last week, she
completed a new program provided by the Women's Employment Network
that is specially designed to help women in low-paying jobs develop
the skills they need to acquire better-paying positions.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit organization provides job-readiness training and
ongoing support services to help low-income women find and keep
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Its new Job Upgrade for More Pay program meets two nights a week
and covers such topics as interviewing and resume writing, dressing
for respect, handling office politics and stress and time
management. The program is free for low-income working women.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program helps low-income working women to increase their
salaries so that they can better support themselves and their
families,'' said Abigail S. McMahon, director of community resource
development for the network.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by the Educational Testing Service found that
many women could improve their prospects of moving into the middle
class with minimal training because plenty of jobs are available.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that the economy is strong enough to absorb
everyone now on welfare. However, two-thirds of the women on
welfare lack the skills needed to escape poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it is almost impossible for these women to obtain
this training. Most people get additional job training or advanced
educational degrees as their careers and salaries progress.
</P>
<P>
   Low-income women, many of whom support their families on minimum
wage, cannot afford the additional training they need.
</P>
<P>
   The network's program helps women like Wells develop these
skills so that they can move into jobs with better salaries and
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, who attended college for two years, said the program not
only taught her new skills, but helped her recognize that she
already had a lot of experience.
</P>
<P>
   Women who participate in the program also can receive additional
computer training during a four-week computer course at the Women's
Employment Network.
</P>
<P>
   The next session of the program begins July 12, and runs for
four weeks on Monday and Tuesday evenings. Call (816) 822-8083,
Ext. 124 for more information.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Feeding an almost insatiable demand for negative information in
today's world of bruising politics, private investigators are
playing a larger _ though mostly hidden _ role in the public arena,
digging up dirt on everyone from regulators to elected national and
small-town officials.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's use of private detectives has been widely
reported. But an examination by The New York Times found that over
the past decade they have moved into every corner of public life,
hired by politicians and their surrogates ranging from Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass., to the House Judiciary Committee chairman, Rep.
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and from the former mayor of New York, David
Dinkins, to aspirants for local city councils.
</P>
<P>
   The private investigators' thick reports usually are aimed at
discrediting critics and disposing of opponents. But they are also
used defensively, to identify and, if possible, to avoid potential
embarrassments.
</P>
<P>
   Today's breed of investigators include former police officers,
as always, but also former FBI agents, ex-CIA employees, former
prosecutors and, in a trend that raises new ethical questions,
ex-journalists, who can tap old news contacts to get negative
information published.
</P>
<P>
   Operating with little regulation or accountability, the
detectives spy on opponents by posing as reporters, or by sending
in operatives who work as volunteers in the campaign. In a world
where sensitive computer data can flow freely despite privacy laws,
some routinely obtain protected information ranging from phone
records to medical histories.
</P>
<P>
   They track down ex-spouses and former associates and employees,
often concealing the reason they are asking questions, and they go
through trash from offices, campaign headquarters and homes, a
practice known as ``Dumpster diving.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a garbage pail I won't get in, not an angle I
won't aim a hidden camera,'' said Larry Preston Williams, a former
police intelligence officer in New Orleans, who sends every
statewide candidate in Louisiana an offer to dig up ``white lies''
and other information about opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take cases from Republicans, Democrats, conservatives,
liberals,'' Williams said. ``It's all information.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how frequently private detectives are used in
political campaigns. The Federal Election Commission says it cannot
monitor campaign spending on them because payments are routinely
lumped with fees to lawyers. And journalists who cooperate with
detectives often promise confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has, however, begun to examine some of
the techniques that private investigators and information brokers
use to obtain confidential information. In April the Federal Trade
Commission filed a landmark suit against a Colorado investigator
over the use of deceptions known as pretexts to obtain information
about private bank accounts, and on June 25 state authorities
indicted him on racketeering charges. Congress is considering
legislation to outlaw pretexts.
</P>
<P>
   Personal attacks have been part of political campaigns since the
nation's inception. But for most of this century unwritten rules
kept within bounds what was called ``opposition research.'' The
typical investigator was a campaign worker or occasionally a
moonlighting police officer. Inquiries focused on public
information such as voting records and court cases.
</P>
<P>
   Those rules vanished after allegations of marital infidelity
drove Gary Hart out of the race for president in 1988. Campaigns
veered into nastier and more personal areas, and as they did,
professional investigators replaced the amateurs and techniques got
more aggressive. Today, even candidates reluctant to get into the
muck say they feel compelled to respond in kind.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Monks, a candidate who hired detectives in a Republican
primary for the Senate from Maine, defended the need for full
disclosure, even if the information is painful and personal.
</P>
<P>
   ``One is thought of as being worse for calling attention to
these things,'' Monks said. ``I think it's wrong for people to run
for office without making a disclosure of material facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy offered a similar rationale for hiring private
investigators to scrutinize his most recent opponent, Mitt Romney.
``Opposition research is part of the modern campaign process,''
said a spokesman, Will Keyser. ``In 1994, Sen. Kennedy's record was
an open book and his opponent's was largely unknown. It was
important and appropriate for the campaign to conduct thorough
research into all the available public information.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Rollins, a veteran Republican political consultant who
acknowledges using private investigators, said, ``Most people today
are trying to find as much dirt as they can. There may be less
tendency to push the button on the personal stuff, but the digging
is going right on.''
</P>
<P>
   This demand for dirt in politics arises during a boom era for
private investigators in the business world. Started by the
corporate takeovers of the early 1980s and fueled by computers,
corporate investigators have become an essential part of the
information economy.
</P>
<P>
   Annual revenues have quintupled to $5 billion since 1980,
according to one industry association, and investigators are
pivotal players in everything from hostile takeovers to hiring
executives and ferreting out internal fraud. The spillover into
politics was natural.
</P>
<P>
   But the best-known firms from the world of corporate snooping
say they avoid the political arena for fear that fallout from the
cases would damage their reputations and antagonize better-paying
business clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to tell you that we haven't looked up a name for
someone in politics, but it is the policy of the company that we
don't do political work,'' said Michael Cherkasky, president of
Kroll Associates, the world's largest corporate investigative firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain things that we tend not to do because they
are dirty,'' he said. ``We don't do matrimonial, we don't do
criminal defense and we don't do political.''

   Michael Hershman, chairman of Decision Strategies Fairfax
International, another large firm, said his investigators examined
the backgrounds of vice presidential possibilities for the Dukakis
and Clinton campaigns, but with their knowledge and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've taken a strong policy position on not doing political
opposition research, and I am personally against opposition
research, which I believe adds to the scourge of negative
campaigning,'' Hershman said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few major firms that solicits political cases is
Investigative Group International, the Washington company run by
Terry Lenzner, a former Watergate prosecutor. Though best known as
an investigator for Clinton's lawyers, he has also worked for
Republicans, including former Rep. Michael Huffington in his losing
Senate race in California against Dianne Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, Lenzner created a division called Campaign
Facts to specialize in political investigations. He also maintains
a tiny law firm, Terry F. Lenzner PC, which several former
employees said is used partly to provide politically sensitive
inquiries an extra layer of confidentiality through attorney-client
privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Lenzner was subpoenaed by Kenneth Starr, the
independent counsel, to testify before a grand jury about inquiries
into Clinton's critics and two of Starr's prosecutors. Lenzner said
he was not a target of the grand jury but, stung by the
controversy, now even he is considering cutting back on political
work.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Lenzner said political cases represent only a
fraction of the firm's revenue, though he defended such work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I perceive it to be analogous to a hostile takeover case where
we are hired by a company to gather information to convince
shareholders to vote for our client,'' he said. ``You are looking
at substantive issues that are relevant to the voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, the House Judiciary chairman, turned to a private
detective when a critic was trying to draw attention to his role in
a failed savings and loan.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, the detective, Ernie Rizzo, a former police
officer in a Chicago suburb, provided details of his work for Hyde
for the first time _ and described his disdain for politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians are the easiest people in the world to set up,''
Rizzo said. ``They're all whores. You stay with them for a week and
you'll catch them doing something _ women or money or something.
Forget about the millions spent in political campaigns. You don't
need that. Everybody got to the top by stepping over somebody. Find
the weakest link and attack it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rizzo, as a lone operator, is typical of detectives who handle
political work. A character who would be at home in a Damon Runyon
story, he is outgoing and flashy; his holographic business card is
emblazoned with the image of a spy and six phone numbers, including
one for his boat.
</P>
<P>
   Rizzo said he was hired in late 1995 by James Schirott, a lawyer
defending Hyde in a federal suit against him and other former
directors of Clyde Federal Savings and Loan. The thrift's 1990
failure cost taxpayers $67 million.
</P>
<P>
   Schirott, he said, told him the congressman was concerned about
a man turning up at hearings on the suit. Hyde wanted to know who
he was and what he knew. The lawyer gave Rizzo a name, Tim
Anderson, and an address in Libertyville, a suburb of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I did was I pulled phone records,'' Rizzo
explained. ``I saw Anderson was making 30 or 40 calls a day to the
media. I told Hyde, but he still didn't know who he was. I saw the
media calls, so I decided to pretend I was from the media.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he telephoned Anderson, claiming to be a producer for
``20/20,'' the ABC news program. Anderson agreed to meet him near
O'Hare International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Getting a target's phone records is often the starting point of
an inquiry, investigators say. While Rizzo was convicted of illegal
wiretapping in 1977 for taping conversations in divorce cases,
privacy experts say phone records fall into a gray area in most
states. Rizzo said he got the records from a source at a telephone
company, and the Illinois attorney general's office said no state
law was violated. A spokesman for Ameritech, the regional telephone
company based in Chicago, said the company does not provide
customer records to anyone without a court order and any employee
who violated the rule would be fired.
</P>
<P>
   Rizzo said he flew to New York and took a flight back to Chicago
in case Anderson watched the airport for his arrival. But Anderson
was not suspicious. A former banking consultant, he had contacted
dozens of journalists trying to expose what he believed were the
political roots of the savings and loan scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said he gladly gave Rizzo his material on Hyde _ a
bound file containing 388 pages of court records, newspaper
articles and documents obtained through the Freedom of Information
Act.
</P>
<P>
   Among the documents were minutes of Clyde federal board meetings
that showed Hyde playing a more active role than he had
acknowledged publicly. In one instance, he approved an investment
in speculative options trading that eventually lost $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Rizzo, however, also wanted to know about Anderson, especially
any vulnerabilities he had. So, the detective said: ``I warned him
that Hyde was going to come after us and I had to make sure he
didn't have any skeletons. I got him telling me all his weak
spots.''
</P>
<P>
   Rizzo said he gave the file to Hyde and was paid by a political
ally of the congressman, not by his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, The Chicago Tribune disclosed Rizzo's duping of
Anderson. In his interview with The Times, Rizzo revealed that just
two months later, in December, he employed the technique again
because Hyde and his allies feared Anderson might use the
disclosure to disrupt the impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day before the impeachment trial started in the House, I
sent two guys back in,'' Rizzo said. ``They posed as reporters. We
wanted to know if Anderson was going to sue Hyde or make any other
noise. But he told them he wasn't going to sue. He was on a
crusade. It was hilarious.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde refused to be interviewed for this article, but a spokesman
disputed several aspects of Rizzo's account.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman, Sam Stratman, said Hyde was told that Anderson
had been investigated, but that Rizzo did not deliver his findings
to the congressman. Hyde never met Rizzo and had no knowledge of
his techniques, he said. Stratman said $2,000 of $20,000 in fees
paid to Schirott was for Rizzo's services. Schirott did not return
numerous phone calls from The Times over several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 the federal government settled its suit with the former
Clyde federal directors for $850,000. Hyde maintained he had no
responsibility for the thrift's failure and he did not contribute
to the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is carrying on, working for $7.50 an hour at Enterprise
Rent-a-Car to provide time for his crusade, even though his wife
has pleaded with him to give up and return to his profession.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he said the congressman's investigation had strengthened
his resolve. ``I'm an innocent member of the public and the head of
the Judiciary Committee hired a detective to spy on me,'' he said
indignantly.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Compared with flashy Rizzo, Larry Preston Williams is a model of
decorum, given to three-piece suits and understatement.
</P>
<P>
   An ex-lawyer and former New Orleans police officer, he estimates
that political cases represent 15 percent of his business as a
private investigator. While clients occasionally send him after
national politicians, his usual target is a candidate for local or
state office in Louisiana and other southern states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of cases has picked up in recent years,'' he said.
``The aggressiveness has picked up. The willingness to use
information publicly to simply obliterate the opposition forever
has increased.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams will happily plow through a target's garbage but his
time is more often spent wading through public records looking for
lawsuits, unpaid taxes, property ownership, divorces, arrests and
the like. He charges $50 to $150 an hour, depending on the
complexity of the case. A routine investigation costs $3,000 to
$4,000.
</P>
<P>
   What turns up most often is mundane, too: candidates or
officials who misrepresent work history, education or military
service. Baby Boomers are particularly likely to fabricate service
in Vietnam or a Purple Heart, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, a candidate for New Orleans City Council hired
Williams to investigate whether an opponent met residency
requirements. The results of his two-month inquiry filled a folder
two inches thick and ranged from letters from former employers
verifying employment dates to lists of credit cards and phone
records.
</P>
<P>
   Williams leaked the information to reporters, leading to
newspaper articles that questioned whether the candidate, Ellen
Hazeur, met the residency requirement. Voters did not seem to care;
Ms. Hazeur won.
</P>
<P>
   Williams compiled a thicker dossier on David Duke, the former Ku
Klux Klan leader whose Republican candidacies for the state
Legislature and Congress have roiled Louisiana politics for the
past decade.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation turned up some early evidence linking Duke to
neo-Nazis, and his client, a prominent Republican, used the report
to orchestrate a campaign publicizing Duke's white supremacist
ties.
</P>
<P>
   For clients willing to spend $50,000 or more, Williams advises
hiring a detective to start digging a year before the election.
That enables them to start a trickle of negative information about
their opponent that builds to a crescendo just before the election.
He would not identify any clients who took that course.
</P>
<P>
   For W. John Hathaway, the negative information was not a trickle
but an explosion. Running for the Republican Senate nomination from
Maine in 1996, he watched in shock as two major newspapers
published articles the same day reporting he had been accused of
having a sexual relationship with a 12-year-old baby sitter.
</P>
<P>
   Six years earlier, when he lived in Huntsville, Ala., a girl who
sat for his children had claimed she had a sexual relationship with
him. He denied the accusation. Two district attorneys and the state
attorney general investigated and decided not to prosecute at the
request of the girl's parents. In a recent interview, Hathaway
again denied the accusation and said he had expected it to remain
secret because no charges were filed.
</P>
<P>
   But rumors began to circulate during the primary, in which
Hathaway was one of three Republicans vying for the seat left open
by William Cohen. The others were Robert Monks, an established
political figure in Maine, and Susan Collins, a political newcomer.
</P>
<P>
   As the primary approached, Monks became alarmed, he said in a
recent interview. His polls showed Hathaway the likely winner, and
nothing had surfaced about the baby sitter's accusation. He turned
to Lenzner, whom he had known for years, authorizing him to
dispatch detectives from IGI to Alabama to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't as if it was a secret,'' Monks recalled. ``It was a
piece of information that was something that people didn't want to
have anything to do with.''
</P>
<P>
   A person involved in the IGI investigation said detectives
interviewed the girl's mother and other people and provided a
report to the Monks campaign. Five days before the primary, The
Boston Globe and Portland Press Herald published articles about the
accusation, reporting that Hathaway had denied the charges and had
never been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   After the articles appeared, Hathaway accused Monks of leaking
the story. Monks admitted hiring a detective, but denied that his
efforts led to the articles. Even that admission took a toll on
Monks. He finished last, with Hathaway second and Ms. Collins, who
had refused to comment on the controversy, winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing blew up in Monks' face,'' said Christian
Potholm, a government professor at Bowdoin College in Maine.
``People felt that this was not something that a Bill Cohen or a
George Mitchell would have done.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether IGI played a role in either article.
Investigators usually turn over information to the client and let
the campaign decide how to handle it.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Kurkjian, the lead reporter on The Globe's article, said
he might have talked to an IGI investigator, but that an editor had
sent him to Huntsville on a tip. ``I had the story without them,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Campbell of the Press Herald would not identify his
initial source. ``It didn't matter where it was coming from,'' he
said. ``I was more concerned with whether the rumors were
factual.''
</P>
<P>
   In the recent interview, Monks said his staff had discussed the
information with reporters. He still denied that the investigators
were behind the articles, but he acknowledged opening a Pandora's
box by sending them to Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once someone had stuck their hand in the thicket,'' he said,
``the information began to flow.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   No incident better demonstrates the power of private
investigators than the runoff for Houston mayor in 1991 between Bob
Lanier, a millionaire businessman, and Sylvester Turner, a
Harvard-educated lawyer and state representative.
</P>
<P>
   Six days before the vote, Houston's ABC affiliate broadcast a
report questioning whether Turner had a role in an insurance scam
in which a former law client had faked drowning. It said Turner had
drawn up the man's will shortly before he disappeared and had been
involved in efforts to collect his insurance money. It quoted
Turner saying he was a victim of the scam and had cooperated with
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters from the University of Houston interviewing voters the
night the story aired watched Turner's numbers plunge. ``Until
then, the race was very close, with a slight but statistically
insignificant advantage to Turner,'' said Richard Murray, who
supervised the poll. ``We could see the direct effect. Turner
dropped eight points.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner blamed the report on Lanier, an accusation the campaign
and TV station denied. Turner never recovered and lost by the
eight-point margin.
</P>
<P>
   Turner later sued the station and its investigative reporter for
libel, and in trial in 1996 the link between the Lanier campaign
and the broadcast was finally discovered. A private investigator on
Lanier's campaign finance committee had delivered a one-page
summary of the allegations to the reporter and arranged for him to
receive court files about the faked death, according to testimony.
</P>
<P>
   After the election, the investigator and a second detective who
also played a role in providing the story to the TV station
received a multimillion-dollar contract from the Lanier
administration to collect overdue parking fines.
</P>
<P>
   The jury found that the broadcast was false and awarded Turner
$5.5 million, a figure the judge reduced to $3.25 million. Last
December, an appellate court set aside the verdict, ruling that
Turner was a public figure. Turner has appealed.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Turner criticized the private investigators.
``They did not care anything about the person, or family, or common
decency,'' he said. ``They were hired to do a job _ and they were
successful.''

 &HT;    POWER USER: Special laptop found in hunt of computer show's
treasures
 &HT;    By Gerry Yandel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This was originally supposed to be a column about
what's new in SVGA, the future of computer visuals and how the glut
of cheap chips means you can build a workaday home PC around your
monitor.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before I stumbled into heaven for a few hours last
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Heaven, it turns out, was in the Cobb County Civic Center, just
north of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   A flier had come in the mail for the Atlanta Area Computer Show
last Saturday and Sunday. I tend to avoid any ``shows'' that charge
you to spend your own money, and this one cost $5 to get in, $6 for
both days.
</P>
<P>
   But because it was pouring rain, and I had never been to one of
them, I decided to see what it was all about.
</P>
<P>
   When I parked, I noticed there were a lot of people carrying
computer cases and boxes of other stuff out to their cars. I had
half a notion that maybe I'd stumble across a cheap, old 486 or
something similar, so I took my checkbook.
</P>
<P>
   Oops.
</P>
<P>
   I had never been inside the Cobb Civic Center before. After
shelling out the five bucks, I found myself looking at a row of
tables that followed the perimeter of the building. The tables were
overflowing with every manner of hardware, software and
everything-in-between-ware.
</P>
<P>
   Wait, it gets even better.
</P>
<P>
   Those tables all overlooked the civic center floor, where there
were several more rows of tables full of stuff: glittering green
circuit boards, racks of CD-ROMs, boxes full of video accelerators,
sound cards, modems, network hubs, chips, cases, books.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing I don't recall seeing was a mousepad, which
somehow lent an air of authenticity to the show.
</P>
<P>
   I was standing at the rail, looking down on this DragonCon for
gearheads, when I spotted the tableful of laptops.
</P>
<P>
   Oops.
</P>
<P>
   I had been thinking for some time that I needed a laptop, but
every time I looked at an ad, even the mom-and-pop outlets were
getting upward of $1,200 for new models.
</P>
<P>
   I knew what I wanted: a portable that could handle Word, for
desktop publishing stuff; Ultraedit, text editor I use for HTML;
Photoshop, for graphics work; Netscape, for, well, everything; and
all my little Internet toys, like WS-FTP, mIRC, Agent, etc.
</P>
<P>
   I'd also need a modem PC card, and I wanted a Pentium-class
machine with as much storage as possible.
</P>
<P>
   So I headed down the steps, merely to see what they had on that
tableful of laptops.
</P>
<P>
   The show was wondrous. It was a digital flea market ... and most
of the stuff was priced to sell quickly.
</P>
<P>
   One grandmotherly woman had a table full of plastic bins holding
nothing but computer cables of every shape, size, width and
persuasion. A friendly guy with a few display racks of CD-ROMs had
bargain-bin prices on current versions of big-name software, like
Win 95a and Win 95b (for those of us who avoid Win 98) and
two-for-ones on those CDs they use as filler (just think MultiMedia
Joke Kit) in retail store software bundles.
</P>
<P>
   There were tables of nothing but motherboards ... past and
present. Some vendors dealt in antiques, and if they didn't have
your particular obscure item, they knew who on the floor did. (One
poor guy was selling brand spanking new midtowers with 400 MHz and
450 MHz chips starting at over $1,000. Nobody stopped at his
table.)
</P>
<P>
   I was there for laptops. That first table I spotted had older
Pentiums from 75 MHz up to about 133 MHz for anywhere between $425
and $750. Some had external CD-ROMs, others had no CD drive at all.
There were familiar brands and totally obscure brands. All of them
weighed a lot.
</P>
<P>
   I ferreted out another laptop dealer with some nice-looking
Apple powerbooks, but apparently even old Macs cost too much. A
third dealer had the one I ended up buying _ a titanium-encased
Panasonic MKIII CF-41 that you could use to hammer in a nail.
</P>
<P>
   It has a built-in floppy drive, built-in CD-ROM (under the
keyboard, which may or may not be a good thing), a 1-gig hard
drive, 16 megs of RAM, Win 95b and Office 97.
</P>
<P>
   A 75 MHz version of it was on the table priced at $475, but the
dealer also had a 120 MHz version off to the side that he was
testing out with ``You Don't Know Jack 2.'' He said he'd give me
that one for $500.
</P>
<P>
   Oops.
</P>
<P>
   I also had to find someone selling PCMCIA modem cards, and
picked up a Compaq 28.8 and pigtail cable for $35.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the hardware for sale, the laptop came without
paperwork and the bare minimums: a power adapter and two power
cables (but a docking station was a nice plus).
</P>
<P>
   In all, a pretty neat deal, I thought. And this time I
remembered to boot up before signing the check.
</P>
<P>
   When I got home, I stuck the laptop in my shoulder bag, grabbed
the docking station and met my wife coming out the door on her way
to work.
</P>
<P>
   Oops.

</P>
<P>
   In all, a pretty neat deal, I thought. And this time I
remembered to boot up before signing the check.
</P>
<P>
   When I got home, I stuck the laptop in my shoulder bag, grabbed
the docking station and met my wife coming out the door on her way
to work.
</P>
<P>
   Oops.

ANALYSIS: PAKISTANI'S PULLOUT VOW IS A VERY HARD SELL AT HOME 
</HEADLINE>
 (See also INDIA-PAKISTAN-PUNJAB) 
(nk) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAHORE, Pakistan _ Once he gets home from his Washington
tete-a-tete with President Clinton, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif is likely to find it difficult to deliver on his pledge to
the Americans that he would seek to withdraw Pakistani-backed
forces from the Indian side of the cease-fire line in the disputed
territory of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Few in Pakistan saw Sharif's sudden decision to call on Clinton
on Sunday _ and his promise to take ``concrete steps'' to restore
the cease-fire line _ as a breakthrough that would help end a
limited, undeclared war with India. Rather, the moves were viewed
by most Pakistanis either as a sell-out of the Kashmir cause or
another ill-fated move in a diplomatic game of chess.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition political parties sharply criticized Sharif on Monday
for apparently giving away what they believe to be hard-won
military gains in Kashmir for nothing much in return.
</P>
<P>
   The main Islamic opposition group, the Jamaat-e-Islami party,
which is known more for its street power than its voting strength,
called for rallies all over the country on Tuesday to protest what
it called the prime minister's treasonous behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic militants fighting in Kashmir _ whom Sharif has all
along said Pakistan does not control _ denounced the deal and vowed
that they would not withdraw from the mountain peaks on the Indian
side of the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure whether Nawaz Sharif or even the military have
the influence to get the mujahedeen to withdraw,'' said Rifaat
Hussain, a professor of international relations at Quaid-I-Azam
University in Islamabad. ``They do get support from Pakistan, but
that doesn't mean they're willing to do Pakistan's bidding.''
</P>
<P>
   Political experts also questioned whether Sharif, who has
quickly backed away from other unpopular decisions, would have the
political will to insist on a withdrawal if it cost him dearly with
the powerful military establishment, Islamic fundamentalist groups
and the Pakistani people, who for the most part revere the forces
in Kashmir as freedom fighters battling for the rights of Kashmir's
Muslim majority.
</P>
<P>
   The promise of a visit to Pakistan by Clinton would not be
enough to sell a pullout, the experts said. Rather, Sharif would
need a reciprocal withdrawal of Indian forces from the Kargil and
Dras sectors of Kashmir, where fighting has raged for two months,
or the strong prospect that India _ under pressure from the United
States _ would seriously talk about settling the Kashmir conflict
once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   But India, which maintains that Pakistan has been a devious
aggressor in this conflict, reiterated Monday its unequivocal
position that the invaders must withdraw before India will talk
about any issue.
</P>
<P>
   And a day after its military triumphantly claimed victory in
recapturing the strategic Tiger Hill ridge, an observation point
overlooking a crucial supply route, India was in no mood for
compromise. Asked if there was an acceptable timetable for a
Pakistani pullout, Raminder Singh Jassal, spokesman for India's
Foreign Ministry said, ``Yes, there is a time frame, which is
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   India, whose army turned to another large operation in Kashmir
on Monday, attacking positions in the Batalik sector, also plainly
stated that there is no role for the United States in settling the
dispute. And Washington, for its part, has reaffirmed its long-held
position that it cannot serve as a mediator on Kashmir until India
requests American help.
</P>
<P>
   The festering, periodically violent conflict over Kashmir dates
to 1947, when the two nations were created from the British Raj.
Predominantly Hindu India claims Kashmir as one of its states,
while Pakistan says the Muslim-majority territory should have the
right to choose whether to be part of Pakistan or India.
</P>
<P>
   The two nations have fought two wars over Kashmir, in 1947 and
1965, and the fighting this year is the most serious in almost 30
years. It is the first that has threatened to explode into
full-fledged war since India and Pakistan became declared nuclear
weapons states a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Already Monday, Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz seemed to
be giving Sharif a way to avoid withdrawal. He told the BBC that it
would be difficult for Pakistan to persuade the Islamic militants
to pull out of Indian-held Kashmir unless the status of Kashmir was
put back on the international agenda.
</P>
<P>
   India scoffs at such statements because it says the men fighting
in Kashmir are mainly Pakistani army regulars. But even if the
fighters are Pakistan-backed militants who refuse to leave, it
seems that the Sharif government could eventually force them to do
so by cutting off their food and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Majid Nizami, 70, chief editor of the Lahore newspaper The
Nation as well as a friend and sometimes critic of the Sharif
family, said he believed that there would be no withdrawal because
the Kashmir cause is too close to the heart of most Pakistanis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it won't be implemented because it would be political
suicide for Nawaz Sharif,'' he said. ``He will come home and say,
`I'll try to persuade the mujahedeen to come back.' After a month
or two, there will be the rainy season in Kargil. In areas the
mujahedeen have held, they will stay if they can. If not, because
of weather, they will retreat.''
</P>
<P>
   It remained unclear whether Pakistan's military, which has
repeatedly usurped civilian authority in the last 50 years, would
back Sharif's withdrawal plan. Some experts believe he consulted
top military officers about his Washington strategy.
</P>
<P>
   But others worry that powerful elements in the military will not
tolerate a unilateral withdrawal from Kashmir and fret about the
possibility of a coup.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international community has to be very careful about the
demands it makes on Nawaz Sharif at this time,'' said one political
expert, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Several retired senior military officers lashed out Monday at
Sharif's government.
</P>
<P>
   ``They simply succumbed and surrendered to the U.S. and to India
and deprived the mujahedeen of whatever advantage they had hitherto
gained,'' said the former army chief of staff, Gen. Mirza Aslam
Beg.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Hameed Gul, also retired, said, ``It is a total
sell-out.''

   PAC-DONATIONS (WASHINGTON) _ When it comes to how incumbents
raise money, wide differences exist among members of Congress from
Missouri and Kansas, data from the Center for Responsive Politics
show. The amount House incumbents received from individuals giving
$1,000 or less in 1997-98 ranged from 3 percent by U.S. Rep. Pat
Danner of Kansas City_ the lowest in all of Congress _ to 67
percent for Rep. Jim Talent, a St. Louis Republican who now is
running for governor. Political action committees accounted for 79
percent of Danner's money, but only 30 percent of Talent's. On
average, House incumbents got about 42 percent of their money from
PACs, which can give up to $5,000 to each candidate in the primary
and that much more in the general. By KEVIN MURPHY. Story will move
in the ``w'' category.

 &HT;    Holyfield contemplates life after boxing
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It hit Evander Holyfield one morning last week like a
Lennox Lewis jab _ flush and startling. Boxing does not last
forever. It's a simple concept, but not so much to a boxer.
Fighters fight. But until when?
</P>
<P>
   Not much longer for three-time heavyweight champion Holyfield,
who has charted a fitting conclusion to a career marked by
overachievement. At 36, there's not much more to conquer before
retiring to his palatial estate off the highway just south of
Atlanta named after him.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, with Holyfield, the exit would have to be something
grand, something symbolic of the caliber of his career and the
goodwill spirit of the man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years at the most,'' he said. ``If it all happens
properly, it'll take just two years. Five more fights, maybe.
Lennox Lewis this year. Then the mandatory _ Henry Akinwande. Then,
it's probably David Tua. Then the No. 2-ranked guy. And then it's,
`Will Mike Tyson be ready?'
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing for sure, before that last fight, I'll take a year
off and travel the world being an ambassador to boxing as the
undisputed heavyweight champion.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield slid to the edge of his seat. A slight smile creased
his lips. He was excited. ``I'll go everywhere I can around the
world and put boxing where it should be. Give it the proper
perspective. I'll make people everywhere feel good about the game,
meet me as the heavyweight champion. I'll set a precedent, get
everybody hyped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I'll have one more fight. Pay-per-view. See how many
people tune in. I want to do something so sensational I can't do
anymore. Then, I'll have a press conference saying, 'I'm ready to
clean my hands.' I don't want to go out a former champion.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield understands, however, that his grand plan could blow
up with more underwhelming performances like his last two fights.
He was so lethargic in stopping unknown Vaughn Bean last year and
so seemingly over matched in the controversial draw against Lewis
earlier this year that many observers say Holyfield already has
fought too long.
</P>
<P>
   He scoffs at the notion. Although no contracts have been signed,
Holyfield began pre-training Monday for a rematch with Lewis in Las
Vegas in November. He claims to be ``excited'' because he'll go
into the fight in his best physical condition ever.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield cited a poor diet heavy on carbohydrates as a reason _
not an excuse _ for his performance against Lewis that was short of
energy and effectiveness. ``For 14 years, I was taught wrong,'' he
said. ``I was carbo-loading the week before a fight as a marathon
runner would. But that's not the way to go for a boxer. I talked to
a nutritionist, Barry Seal, and it was amazing because he knew how
I felt even though he wasn't around me. He knew that I carbo-loaded
and the effect it had on my body.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt lethargic. I was tired and sleepy and it took me more
energy to think. I would almost fall asleep in the dressing room
before a fight. . . . In the ring, if I fought an aggressive
fighter, it was easier to break out of it because I'll naturally
fight back. But if the guy was just in there, it took a lot to get
me going.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Holyfeld said his diet is less about carbohydrates and
more about Creatine and avoiding fats. ``I'm excited to go with a
totally different training method,'' he said. ``I'm just fortunate
the old way never really caught up with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat remarkably, Holyfield's out-of-ring transgressions
seemingly have not caught up with him, either. Apparently, the
revelations about his personal life in the last year have not
significantly dimmed his public image. Indeed, he might even be
more beloved, which speaks for the genuine nature of the man.
</P>
<P>
   Days after the Bean fight, Holyfield made public that he'd
fathered nine children with six women, one while married to his
wife, Janice. Instead of becoming a recluse in the face of such a
revelation, Holyfield continued to make public appearances _ partly
because he remained in demand and partly because he simply would
not be ashamed of his actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell my kids and the kids I speak to, 'A winner and a loser
have one thing in common: They make mistakes,' `` he said.
``Evander Holyfield certainly has made some mistakes. But if you
treat people nice, they'll give you a second chance.''
</P>
<P>
   His attorney, Jim Thomas, believes Holyfield's disposition is at
the heart of his continued place as a ``good guy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The things he revealed are not really important to the extent
of his ability to help people,'' Thomas said. ``He views life as
being accountable in the eyes of God, not people. So, he continued
to do the things he does.
</P>
<P>
   ``His stature has not diminished at all, from what we can see.
He's still in high demand. Now, there are some individuals who
decided to turn off to Evander. And it's more women than men. But
it's a very, very small percentage.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Holyfield: ``I lot of people are fickle because they judge
people by how they judge themselves. Most people who are successful
receive me with open arms because they understand people go through
ups and downs. Most of the people who admire or receive me are not
quitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been in bondage to people. By that, I mean people
used to talk about me all the time when I was young because we were
poor and didn't have anything. It only hurt when it came from
people that were close to me. So the vast number of people who
criticize me for my mistakes don't know me, so it doesn't affect
me. But it's not about self for me. People appreciate more what you
do for them than what they do for you. I like giving and doing for
people, and they sense that.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas cited a couple of international appearances by Holyfield
as examples of his popularity. ``We were in Monte Carlo for the
World Music Awards,'' Thomas said. ``There were stars all over the
place, including Janet Jackson. But people were coming up to me
saying, 'Forget Janet Jackson, I want to meet the heavyweight
champion.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Same thing in Trinidad when Evander judged the Miss Universe
contest. I can't tell you how popular he was. On the other said of
that, Evander's not fazed by all the attention. It's flattering,
but he's not driven by what others think of him. He believes he's
judged by how he is as a parent and how he treats people.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield, who treated more than 700 people to a barbecue at his
estate Sunday, supports all his children and considers them the
driving force in his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is a man if he doesn't raise his kids, and raise them
properly,'' Holyfield said. ``You'll be a miserable person. I put
my time in with my kids. Your future tends to be based on your
kids' lives. When I'm not speaking or making an appearance, I'm
with always with my kids. I follow them in the summer to their
track meets or soccer or whatever they're doing. They're always a
bright point for me.''
</P>
<P>
   He's going through a dark point with a divorce, however, that
could be lengthy and costly and certainly draining. He said he made
$54 million in the two years he's been married to Janice, and she
apparently wants a significant portion of that earnings. There's
the sticking point.
</P>
<P>
   He did not say what he was offering her as alimony, but
Holyfield wants to negotiate the terms with her, not lawyers. She
wants otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it should depend on the two people what the settlement
is,'' he said. ``We can talk about anything, but when it gets to
that, she gets upset. She wants to go to court. Why drag me into
court on something we can settle ourselves? We need to settle it
out of court. Because of who I am and the money, there's all this
confusion going on. As a man with deep pockets, the system gets
you. If I didn't have money, it was be a divorce in 30 days. Done.
In a divorce situation, all he man have afterward is memories. The
woman has memories and money. It's sad.''
</P>
<P>
   But not something that will break him. He said he holds to his
spirituality as a source of strength. And his commitment to
uplifting boxing while executing his exodus keep him going.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good attitude takes you a lot farther than talent,''
Holyfield said. ``I don't think people still like or accept me
because I'm the heavyweight champion. It's the individual. I was
raised to treat people nicely. And that's what I do. Boxing's going
to be over soon, but I'll be the same person. You can say this
about me: 'The man knows how to be champion.' ``

SOUTH AFRICA STARTS NEW ERA WITH A BURST OF INVECTIVE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ South Africa's second
post-apartheid elections are over, but it looks like the
mudslinging may just be getting started.
</P>
<P>
   The first two weeks of President Thabo Mbeki's new
administration have been a feast of charges and countercharges,
with politicians calling each other everything from ``soulless,''
``mean'' and ``unforgiving'' to ``tamed baboons'' and ``toothless
Chihuahuas.''
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki, whose African National Congress won nearly a two-thirds
majority in Parliament, has hardly been playing Mr. Nice Guy.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to Parliament on June 28, he gave a relentless
verbal beating to a tiny black Christian party that won less then 1
percent of the vote after it criticized an official of his African
National Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in what many consider a particularly spiteful move, he
kept the official opposition party off the important Judicial
Services Commission, which, among other things, makes nominations
to the bench. He gave a seat instead to a leader of the Federal
Alliance party, which has only 2 of the 400 seats in National
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Furious over Mbeki's move, Tony Leon, the head of the official
opposition, the liberal and largely white Democratic Party, called
the Federal Alliance leader, Louis Luyt, the former rugby magnate
who got the commission seat instead, the Afrikaans word for a
``tame baboon.'' Luyt responded by calling Leon a ``toothless
chihuahua.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of Mbeki's party seem to be doing little better at
getting along. The former leader of the provincial government in
Mpumulanga, Mathews Phosa, has decided to sue the new one, Ndaweni
Mahlangu, for defamation.
</P>
<P>
   The series of insults from all sides was set off when Mahlangu,
who was hand-picked for his post by Mbeki and who had been in
office barely a week, proclaimed that all politicians lie and he
has no trouble with that. Then he seemed to implicate Phosa in a
scandal over the signing of illegal notes by the previous
administration.
</P>
<P>
   When Mbeki addressed Parliament last week, he lashed out at the
tiny African Christian Democratic Party for calling for Mahlangu's
resignation. Mbeki attacked the Christian Democrats on several
fronts, saying their support of the death penalty and opposition to
abortion puts forward a ``mean, angry, vengeful, soulless and
retributive theology.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mbeki was only working up to his grand finale, which was a
defense of Mahlangu, a former official in the apartheid-era
homeland system, which forced many blacks to move to small
segregated areas. Mahlangu has been under fire not only for the
remark about lying but also because he has appointed a number of
officials of questionable competence and integrity.
</P>
<P>
   When Mahlangu was being questioned about why he had appointed an
official who was involved in the scandal in which government-owned
parkland was used as collateral for loans, Mahlangu had seemed to
imply that Phosa was responsible for the scandal and for the other
official's involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki did not address that aspect of the issue but defended
Mahlangu on the grounds that he had apologized for the remarks
about lying and should be allowed to get on with his job.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki said that the Christian Democrats, in calling for
Mahlangu's resignation, remain ``true to a theology which knows no
forgiveness, no compassion, no humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And so,'' Mbeki added, the party members ``stand up in this
House and declaim, `He is down! Crucify him! Crucify him! Crucify
him! Crucify him!'''
</P>
<P>
   While the small party was the focus of Mbeki's tirade, it has
hardly been alone in calling for Mahlangu's resignation. In the
last few days, theologians across the country have said that
remarks like his about lying cannot be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   Leon's liberal Democratic Party also came under fire from Mbeki,
who said it was putting forward a ``soulless secular theology''
that would leave survival to the fittest and do nothing to reach
out to those who had been treated as ``subhuman'' under apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   But the real blow to that party came when the ANC's chief whip
read out the names of the six members of the Judicial Commission.
Instead of the expected Democratic representative, the whip
announced Luyt's name.
</P>
<P>
   Luyt, a fertilizer and beer magnate, became well known in South
Africa as a rugby franchise owner. But in recent years, he has also
become known as the man who dragged former President Nelson Mandela
into court to question his right to appoint a commission to look
into racism in rugby. Luyt went on to accuse about half of the
Constitutional Court of being biased against him.
</P>
<P>
   The General Council of the Bar of South Africa quickly slammed
Mbeki's choice, saying the appointment of Luyt was either ``not
considered or not in good faith.''

 &HT;    Taking issue with Hemingway-as-commodity
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The publisher of Ernest Hemingway's posthumous novel ``True at
First Light'' may be able to fool some people, but not the late
writer's granddaughter. In a delightfully honest essay in GQ ($3),
titled ``The Snow Job of Kilimanjaro,'' Lorian Hemingway, author of
the memoir ``Walk on Water,'' criticizes the commercialization of
the family name and bemoans the publication of work her grandfather
did not consider ready for print.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not to say that those who would abuse the concept of
literary integrity are guilty of high crime, but that they are
simply in the business of peddling Hemingway as if he were a QVC
home-shopping-network item,'' she writes. As an example, she cites
the new line of Hemingway furniture that reflects Papa's lifestyles
in Key West, Cuba and Idaho and a collection of children's books
and clothes. What's next, she asks: a Tickle-Me Erno doll?
</P>
<P>
   _ Music to our ears: Details ($2.95) spices up what could be
another dull list in an attitude-dripping article on the 49 Best
Albums of All Time. Instead of listing the usual suspects, Jeff
Ousborne has come up with such interesting categories as ``best
album to listen to while being pursued by the police at
ridiculously high speeds'' (James Brown's ``Greatest Hits'') or
``best album to encourage you to buy firearms'' (Jewel's
``Spirit''). Other gems include Frank Sinatra's ``In the Wee Small
Hours'' for ``best album for the denial stage of a breakup'' and
George Jones' ``16 Biggest Hits'' for ``best album recorded drunk,
drugged, armed, divorced and jailed.''
</P>
<P>
   _ More music to our ears: The Jacksonville band Limp Bizkit
isn't happy being merely a best-selling rap metal group with a hit
album. Singer-choreographer Fred Durst wants a multimedia empire _
and some respect. He lays out his plans in an over-the-top
interview in the August issue of Spin ($2.99). Elsewhere in the
magazine, Sarah McLachlan explains why she's not unhappy about
dropping the final curtain on the Lilith Fair concert tour.
</P>
<P>
   _ Inside Iran: Much has changed in Iran since a group of
Americans were held hostage at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran.
Traveling throughout the country for National Geographic ($3.95),
author Fen Montaigne and photographer Alexandra Avakian found that
many Iranian women are losing patience with the restrictions of a
male-dominated society. Despite government efforts to shield
Iranians from ``corrupting'' Western influences, the Internet and
TV satellite dishes are shredding the Islamic curtain, Montaigne
reports.
</P>
<P>
   _ Showbiz buzz: As Entertainment Weekly ($2.99) notes in its
July 9 cover story, even cowboys get the blues. Especially when the
cowboys are in the summer stinker ``Wild Wild West.'' Is the movie
that bad, or is it simply negative word of mouth? Director Barry
Sonnenfeld blames the film's woes on that mysterious Hollywood
ether known as buzz. Entertainment Weekly doesn't buy that
argument. Elsewhere in the magazine, reviewer Owen Glieberman gives
the movie a barely passing grade of D+.
</P>
<P>
   _ Quick reads: In the August issue of More ($2.95), Rita Wilson
explains that she's determined to prove she's not just Mrs. Tom
Hanks. After putting her career on the back burner for four years
to focus on family, Wilson is back with two new movies: ``The Story
of Us,'' with Michelle Pfeiffer and Bruce Willis, and ``Runaway
Bride,'' with Richard Gere. ... Changing the world is hard, so why
bother? Utne Reader ($4.99) visits with activists and nonactivists,
from a hermit poet to doctors who volunteer for duty in a Third
World hell. ... The July/August issue of Gear ($3.50) is all about
sex, including a fascinating article _ ``The Spy Who Shagged Me'' _
about female secret agents in Israel's Mossad. Apparently, in some
cases, sex appeal is more powerful than bullets. Using her charms,
one of the Mossad's more attractive agents enticed a Soviet-trained
MiG-21 pilot to defect to Israel _ with his plane.

GET PAST THE ILLUSION OF DIALOGUE

 LEWIS W. DIUGUID  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three years ago, Emanuel Cleaver had his Mayor's Task Force on
Race Relations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, President Clinton had his national dialogue on race.
Last week, The Kansas City Star and The Kansas City Call launched a
unique effort to report on and hold forums on race. This fall,
Kansas City Mayor Kay Barnes plans to appoint a committee to work
on race.
</P>
<P>
   Race relations are continually probed too much and not at all.
That centuries-old paradox has deepened one of America's most
enduring problems. It's why racially motivated shootings and
killings like the ones in Illinois and Indiana still occur.
</P>
<P>
   John Hope Franklin, a historian who led Clinton's Race
Initiative Advisory Board, talked about our race problem in May
when he was in town to receive the Harry S. Truman Good Neighbor
Award. Franklin, the first African-American to get the honor,
praised former President Harry S. Truman for a 1947 report titled
``To Secure These Rights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a landmark report made by a landmark president
calling for a revolution in human and social relations,'' Franklin
said. If recommendations in it were followed, America wouldn't have
such trouble in race relations today.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was something wrong with this country, which wasted so
much time, energy and manpower to maintain a biracial society that
was not equal in any respect,'' Franklin said.
</P>
<P>
   Getting everyone to talk is a problem, Cleaver said at last
week's Star//Call forum.
</P>
<P>
   That issue also surfaced at a spring Diversity Forum that the
Coalition for Positive Family Relationships held at the University
of Missouri-Kansas City. About 60 persons attended, but only three,
including me, were men.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is resistance to talking about diversity,'' said Helen
Cohen with Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays
Kansas City chapter. ``There is the appearance of talking about
diversity. I'm not sure how to get beyond the appearance of
acceptance.''
</P>
<P>
   Darryck Dean, associate executive director of Kansas City
Harmony, sat with Cohen on a panel that took up the questions: How
do you have a meaningful dialogue on diversity? What are the
biggest stumbling blocks?
</P>
<P>
   Dean, who is black, said: ``It dawned on me. I've never met a
racist. If you accuse somebody of being prejudiced, they'll
automatically deny it. I don't think people are being honest in
what their prejudices are and in how they discriminate.''
</P>
<P>
   Rita Botello, chairwoman of the Kansas//Missouri board of
Project Equality, said assumptions are the biggest obstacle to
improving relations among people who are different.
</P>
<P>
   Money is another, said Cohen. ``There are institutions that have
a stake in continuing racism and sexism and homophobia,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Star//Call panel and the coalition group did offer some
solutions. Diane Hershberger, Harmony's executive director, asked
people to leave their comfort zones to socialize with others who
are different.
</P>
<P>
   At the coalition meeting, people suggested that everyone listen
to radio stations and read books featuring other races, religions,
sexual orientation, ethnicities and cultures.
</P>
<P>
   People said more ``safehouses'' are needed for diversity
discussions where no one would be afraid to risk, be honest and
learn. They suggested that people become more politically active
and push for inclusiveness. Organizations should make sure their
mission and vision statements include diversity.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition group said that for the next forum, each woman
should bring a man. That way more guys would also be enlightened.

   Hippie heifers are hucksters in Chick-fil-A's new campaign
</P>
<P>

   C. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Chick-fil-A cows are retro, man!
</P>
<P>
   In a groovy kinda way.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant company this week begins its summer promotional
campaign featuring the ever-popular ``Eat Mor Chikin'' cows donning
tie-dyed T-shirts, long hair, headbands and shades. And, yes, they
even give the peace sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This falls in with the mood of the country,'' said Chick-fil-A
spokesman Don Perry. ``Everyone is looking back. This is the end of
the century.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, however, the cows try to make sure it's not the end of
them.
</P>
<P>
   In the $1.5 million campaign, which runs through Aug. 31, the
cows continually urge consumers to ``Eat Mor Chikin'' in a uniquely
bovine twist on '60s jargon.
</P>
<P>
   The slogans, which will be heard in radio spots and seen on
billboards, include ``Peece, Luv, Chikin'' and ``Give Chikin A
Chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The company will offer a special Summer of Chikin plush cow for
$4.99.
</P>
<P>
   Participating restaurants also will have specially designed
peel-off game cards attached to medium and large drink cups.
</P>
<P>
   Customers can win a variety of menu items or merchandise, and
1,000 grand-prize winners will receive free Chick-fil-A entree
items for a year.
</P>
<P>
   The crafty cows, which were introduced in 1995, have proven to
be one of the most successful campaigns for the company, receiving
several national and international awards. The campaign was created
by Dallas-based The Richards Group.
</P>
<P>
   The latest campaign, focusing on the '60s, is one of the most
aggressive for the year, Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a creative stroke.''

50 YEARS LATER, JULIETTE GRECO FINDS NEW AUDIENCES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Even with the harsh spotlight heightening the pallor of
her skin against the blackness of her dress, Juliette Greco looks
every bit the grande dame of the chanson francaise. She walks
regally to the microphone and starts singing, her arms soon
sketching in the air the very ardor of her words. In no time, the
audience warms to her. A few songs later, it is on its feet. By the
end, it won't let her go.
</P>
<P>
   It could all be put down to nostalgia. In her late teens, Ms.
Greco was heralded as the muse of Existentialism. She would hang
out with the likes of Jean-Paul Sartre, Jean Cocteau, Boris Vian
and Miles Davis in Left Bank bars and cafes crowded with poets and
artists. For an entire generation, she personified the post-war
bohemia of St.-Germain-des-Pres. Now, at 72, when she returns to
the stage, she is a treat for those who want to remember.
</P>
<P>
   What most pleases the petite, dark-eyed singer, however, is that
she is still a voice of today. When she sings in Paris or around
Europe and beyond, there are always many in the audience who who
are seeing her on the stage for the first time, many who belong to
the generation of her 25-year-old granddaughter. They are not
trying to recapture their youth through snatches of familiar
melodies. They want to experience her songs as love poems of today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get lots of letters,'' Ms. Greco said in her dressing room
during a recent week of sold-out concerts at the Theatre de l'Odeon
in the heart of St.-Germain in Paris. ``They're not strange,
they're very romantic. Full of sweetness, love, tenderness. It's
marvelous. They use the language of children, the language of
youth. It's very beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   She pointed to a small bronze teapot on her makeup table. ``It
was a present last night,'' she said. ``It has a note inside.
`Madame, this is the first time I have seen you perform. I came
Wednesday and I am returning tonight. I loved your recital, it is
beautiful and you were moving. I will soon be 29 and I love you
very much. I admire what you do, you are very committed and I like
that.' Adorable, no?''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, every performer wants to be loved, every star needs
to be loved. But Ms. Greco does not count on old favorites' forever
drawing new fans. For her latest record, ``Un Jour d'Ete et
Quelques Nuits,'' which was well received when it was released last
December, she had a dozen songs written for her by the playwright
Jean-Claude Carriere and her husband, Gerard Jouannest, a composer.
</P>
<P>
   The songs are new, yet they fit squarely into the tradition of
the chanson francaise, that special storytelling genre of popular
music in which words are as important as melodies, a genre that
since World War II has had Charles Trenet, Edith Piaf, Yves
Montand, Jacques Brel, Serge Gainsbourg, Leo Ferre, Barbara,
Charles Aznavour and Ms. Greco among its most popular exponents.
</P>
<P>
   At her concerts here in late May and early June, she offered old
and new to the accompaniment of a five-piece band led by Jouannest
at the piano. ``Les Feuilles Mortes,'' written by Jacques Prevert
and Joseph Kosma and later made popular in English as ``Autumn
Leaves,'' is now something of a signature piece for her. She also
included old songs _ some written for her _ by Ferre, Gainsbourg
and Brel. But most were Carriere-Jouannest songs from her new
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're like little plays,'' explained Ms. Greco, inviting a
visitor to uncork a bottle of chilled white Burgundy. ``They're
typically French. We're a people who express our love in songs, our
anger in songs, even our revolution in songs. That's peculiarly
French. It fits into our great anarchist tradition. But what's
interesting is that the chanson francaise is making a comeback. It
never disappeared, but it's returning with force.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Ms. Greco has not stopped singing in the style,
although she tours frequently outside France. (``I'm an export
product, a French luxury product,'' she said with a laugh.) When
she does return to Paris, she seemingly times her appearances for
maximum impact. Her last series of concerts at the Olympia in 1991
provoked enthusiastic rebirth notices for the chanson francaise.
This spring posters were again proclaiming ``the return of La
Greco.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, was special because she had finally achieved
a lifelong dream of performing in the Odeon, a dream born when she
was a teen-ager wandering the streets of wartime St.-Germain
fantasizing about a career as an actress, as a tragedienne, to be
more exact. She was already too old to fulfill her first dream of
becoming a dancer. The idea of becoming a singer was born somewhat
accidentally a few years later. At that moment, October 1943 in
German-occupied France, she had few options.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Greco's father had left home when she was tiny. After her
mother was arrested for Resistance activities in the Dordogne,
Juliette came to Paris with her older sister, Charlotte, who was
also in the Resistance. One day, seeing the French police arresting
Charlotte, Juliette demanded to be taken along. A few weeks later,
she was freed, but both her mother and Charlotte were deported to
Nazi camps. They survived and were repatriated in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Alone in Paris and still only 15, Ms. Greco was helped by a
family friend who eventually arranged for her to attend acting
classes. Living in a pension with other aspiring young artists, she
grew up quickly. By the late 1940s, while she was hardly noticed
for her occasional small stage roles, her striking looks and
independent spirit had turned La Greco, as she was soon known, into
one of the attractions of St.-Germain's buzzing night life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was bizarre, different,'' she recalled. ``I think I was a
bit shocking. I was all black and white. I had this pale face and
big black eyes, very long straight black hair with a fringe. No one
wore their hair like that in those days. I was dressed in black. I
wore men's clothes because the boys in the pension would hand me
down their old clothes. I had to roll up the trousers and it became
a fashion. Women began to wear men's shirts and jackets and
rolled-up trousers. That's how it started.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Greco said she always had a good ear for music and would
occasionally sing at parties, usually Edith Piaf songs, which were
the rage at the time. Then in 1949, Le Boeuf Sur le Toit, a popular
prewar restaurant-cum-nightclub, was to reopen and she was invited
to join the team organizing the first show. She said she wanted to
sing. But what? She needed advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I went to see Sartre on Rue Bonaparte,'' she said. ``He had
always been nice to me. So had Simone de Beauvoir, very warm, very
affectionate. Anyway, Sartre told me to come back early the
following morning _ I hated getting up early _ and he would suggest
a few poems. I picked from these and he approved the choice. He
then said, `I'm going to give you a song I wrote called La Rue des
Blancs Manteaux.' He'd written it for his play `No Exit,' but he
said the music was bad, so he put me in touch with Joseph Kosma and
voila.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Voila it was, because, at Le Boeuf Sur le Toit, with the words
of renowned poets and the music of a fine composer, Ms. Greco made
her name overnight. Soon she was drawn into the world of the
chanson francaise and others began writing for her. It was an
intellectual world _ Ferre, for instance, would put Rimbaud and
Verlaine to music _ but this only added to her aura. To this day,
her early association with philosophers and intellectuals
contributes to her mystique.
</P>
<P>
   It is something she is willing to exploit for good causes, not
least the somewhat unsuccessful campaign to prevent St.-Germain
from being converted into a quarter of designer boutiques.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make use of my name because it's a name that frightens
people a bit,'' she said with amusement. ``It doesn't mean anything
to me, but I have an audience and when I open my big mouth people
listen. If I want to speak out about St.-Germain on the radio, the
stations say, `Please come, Madame Greco.' My name opens doors.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for all that, she insists she is not interested in
nostalgia. ``I have had an exceptional life,'' she said. ``I've had
to fight a great deal to get what I want. But it's not yesterday
that interests me. I'm interested in today and tomorrow. I don't
like to repeat things. Every night the show is different. After
Paris, it is Italy, then Monte Carlo, which has all those ladies
who can't applaud because their rings are too heavy.''
</P>
<P>
   She certainly looks ready to keep on going. At the Odeon, for
example, she stood for an hour and 55 minutes and sang some 25
songs _ without an intermission. Each time she ends a show in
Paris, however, she also wonders whether it will be her last here.
``Perhaps this is the last time,'' she mused. ``If I don't find
something really new to sing in five years, I'm not returning to
Paris at the age of 76.''
</P>
<P>
   But of course she is already looking for something new.

 &HT;    Lockwood Greene chief resigns to `do something different'
 &HT;    By Susan Harte
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At age 61, Donald R. Luger intends to do something
most people dream about at 21.
</P>
<P>
   Luger, who is resigning as head of Lockwood Greene engineering
firm after three decades with the company, wants to be an
entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very good about my 31 years at Lockwood Greene,'' said
Luger, who submitted his resignation last week. ``But I am in good
health, and I want to do something different. My desire to have my
own business has intensified as I have gotten older.''
</P>
<P>
   Just what that business might be is still up in the air, said
Luger, who has been president of the company for 17 years and is
also its chairman and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   He has a master's degree in civil engineering, a license to
practice in five Eastern states, and an interest in developing
leadership and management skills for the profession. He says the
possibilities are many.
</P>
<P>
   Lockwood Greene is based in Spartanburg, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   The company has annual billings of $300 million and 45 offices
that employ more than 3,000 people worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Constructed value of Lockwood Greene's engineering projects is
more than $5 billion a year. Its major projects have included the
Pratt &AMP; Whitney plant in Columbus, Ga. and the General Mills plant
in Covington, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Luger's handpicked successor is Fred M. Brune, who will take the
reins Aug. 1. Brune, 48, is a former Arthur Young accountant who
became Lockwood Greene's chief financial officer in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Brune was promoted to senior vice president of
corporate services, an umbrella that covered human resources,
marketing, finance and accounting, and information services.
</P>
<P>
   About halfway through Luger's tenure at Lockwood Greene,
Frankfurt, Germany-based Philipp Holtzmann, another large
engineering firm, bought 80 percent of the company. Holtzmann had
already acquired J.A. Jones Construction Co. of Charlotte, N.C.,
and Holtzmann U.S.A. has now been folded into Jones to form a
combination that will handle both engineering and construction
projects.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 Lockwood Greene employees own 20 percent of the
company.

 &HT;    Security: How much does it cost for Bush to jet around applying
to voters for a new job?
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ As Gov. George W. Bush wended his way across
California last week as the leading Republican front-runner for
president, Texas taxpayers were there at every political handshake.
</P>
<P>
   At least their pocketbooks were.
</P>
<P>
   His cadre of bodyguards comes courtesy of the Texas Department
of Public Safety officers and Texas Rangers, and Texans are footing
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   How much does that security cost as Bush jets around the country
applying to voters for a new job?
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides and DPS officials refuse to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``By policy, we don't discuss any aspects of security for the
governor,'' said Mike Cox, a DPS spokesman. ``All I can say is that
we are providing security for him like we have every Texas governor
since 1935. And obviously, at this point there is additional travel
involved as a part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the cost, said Mindy Tucker, a Bush campaign
spokeswoman, ``it's not out of the ordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When (Democrat ex-governor) Ann Richards traveled for
political reasons for Bill Clinton in one of his races, the
protective detail followed her, as well,'' Tucker said. ``It's
common for them to protect the governor whether he is in the state
or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when Clinton was campaigning for the White House while
still governor of Arkansas, Arkansas state troopers accompanied him
until a Secret Service detail took over after the New Hampshire
primary.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, Secret Service protection is afforded ``major
presidential candidates'' _ usually about the time primaries are
held.
</P>
<P>
   During June, Bush spent 12 days outside Texas _ part of a
whirlwind campaign tour that touched Iowa, Michigan, Pennsylvania,
New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Florida
and California, among other states, and helped Bush raise a record
$36.25 million in campaign donations to help cement his status as
the early favorite for the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   By his side at each stop were plainclothes DPS officers and
Rangers, distinguishable by their suits and sunglasses, de rigueur
attire for bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   How many?
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask DPS,'' said Linda Edwards, Bush's gubernatorial press
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't ever discuss the size of the executive protection
detail,'' said Cox, although he acknowledged it was recently
increased in size because of Bush's increasing travel schedule, a
fact that has been widely reported.
</P>
<P>
   How much?
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't comment,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush remained in Texas until the Legislature adjourned May 31,
then began his presidential campaign journeys, Edwards said. While
campaigning for president, Bush continues to collect his
$97,890-a-year salary.
</P>
<P>
   How much is all the additional cross-country travel costing
Texas taxpayers? That information, too, is confidential, officials
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll have to talk to DPS,'' Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't reveal that because that information could tend to
reveal numbers of personnel we have assigned to him,'' Cox said.
``We are very cautious in this regard. We don't go into any numbers
or discuss the budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Inquiring taxpayers can forget perusing a copy of the state
budget to get around the official stonewalling. DPS officials said
the funding for Bush's bodyguards is well-hidden within the $90
million yearly budget of the agency's traffic enforcement division
_ which Cox says has more than 2,000 employees. The Texas Rangers'
annual budget is about $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the only other elected state official besides Bush
to have bodyguards on the payroll _ Attorney General John Cornyn _
was more forthcoming with fiscal details. Cornyn spokesman Ted
Delisi said the Internal Security Division has 19 employees and a
budget of $600,000 _ although the officers assigned to it provide
security at offices and do other jobs, with one only occasionally
protecting Cornyn.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush aides would not discuss specific numbers, they
suggested privately that most of the expense to taxpayers would
come from overtime pay because Bush's DPS security detail travels
on planes and stays in hotels paid for by the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would be with him anyway, whether he was in Houston or
Dallas or Los Angeles,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   So why is Bush, awash in campaign riches, not paying his
security tab instead of leaving it to Texas taxpayers?
</P>
<P>
   Simple, Tucker said. ``It's DPS's responsibility to protect the
governor.''
</P>
<P>

Texas.

NOSTRADAMUS PREDICTS, AND, PREDICTABLY, PARISIANS PACK UP  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Summertime, with all France ready to head off on
vacation in le grand depart _ but will anybody be around for the
rentree in September?
</P>
<P>
   Ominous signs are everywhere. It's the end of the second
millennium; the moon is about to blot out the sun across a swatch
of northern Europe on Aug. 11, and apocalyptic traffic jams are
about to make the French sorry they all insist on starting their
five-week annual vacations on July 14, the Gallic Fourth of July.
</P>
<P>
   But France is also the birthplace of Michel de Nostre-Dame,
better known as Nostradamus, and he had dire predictions for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Nostradamus had dire predictions for just about every year since
his death in 1566, at least for those who find ways of reading them
into his sometimes Delphic verse _ people like Paco Rabanne, the
fashion designer.
</P>
<P>
   ``From mid-July to after the 11th of August,'' Rabanne told Le
Figaro Magazine last month, ``I am recommending to all my friends
to stay at least 60 kilometers from the capital.''
</P>
<P>
   Nostradamus, by Rabanne's reading, had foreseen space travel and
predicted that the battered Mir space station would crash down onto
Paris and leave much of it looking like Hiroshima in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where book publishers seem willing to slap out any
paperback as long as a celebrity's name is on the cover, that was
enough to make Rabanne a best-selling author this year, with a book
called ``1999, Fire From the Heavens,'' published by Editions
Michel Lafon.
</P>
<P>
   Since the book was written, though, Russia has decided to keep
Mir up in the heavens, at least through next January, so perhaps it
will be the fire next time. But with at least 10 books on
Nostradamus still on the shelves, Rabanne's has plenty of company
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this year especially portentous, and sent Rabanne
into Chicken Little mode, is a Nostradamus quatrain that could be
translated from 16th-century French this way:
</P>
<P>
   In thousand nine-hundred ninety-nine, seven months,
</P>
<P>
   A king of terror will come from heaven
</P>
<P>
   To revive the great King of Angouleme,
</P>
<P>
   Setting Mars to reign before and then.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jean-Charles de Fontbrune, a Nostradamus scholar,
the King of Angouleme originally meant Attila the Hun, whose
advance into Gaul in 451 was supposedly stopped near the city of
Angouleme in west-central France.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, as de Fontbrune sees it, the phrase must refer to
China, and Mars, the god of war, was much in evidence in Iraq and
later Kosovo through the first six months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   A horrified frisson went through Paris in May, therefore, when a
U.S. plane mistakenly bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, an
act that threatened to bring China into the NATO war against
Yugoslavia _ real Armageddon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nostradamus predicted it!'' a wealthy real-estate speculator
in the tony 16th arrondissement exclaimed in horror, before heading
off as Rabanne recommended to his country house a safe distance
from Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``If by the 30th of June, `seven months,' President Clinton has
not stopped hostilities in Yugoslavia,'' de Fontbrune warned, ``the
Chinese and the Russians are going to intervene.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, Russia's diplomatic intervention helped persuade
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia to accept NATO's
conditions _ perhaps Milosevic knew that Attila the Hun had also
razed Belgrade _ and the bombing stopped before ``seven months''
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   As for whether Mars will reign after this month, you don't have
to be Nostradamus to predict that Kosovo will not be humanity's
last war. Scholars, who take Nostradamus seriously as the historian
and poet he was, say he sometimes had to write in elliptical terms,
because the Renaissance was a capricious and dangerous time. In
France, people were being massacred by the thousands in religious
wars for what was considered blasphemy.
</P>
<P>
   Seen in this light, the verse about 1999 takes on a quite
different meaning. Louis Schlosser, author of a biography of
Nostradamus, thought he was referring to 1559, not 1999, and to the
death of King Henry II of France that July.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Prevost, a French scholar, explains it differently. The
king of terror in the first two verses, he says, is a French pun on
Geoffrey (Geoffroi rhymes with effroi, literary French for fear or
terror), a reference to Geoffroi or Godefroi de Bouillon, a
Crusader who conquered Jerusalem in July 1099.
</P>
<P>
   The great King of Angouleme, then, is simply Francis I of
France, known as Francis of Angouleme and King of France from 1515
to 1547. Nostradamus, the king's loyal subject, was just paying
tribute.
</P>
<P>
   In Prevost's book on the subject, ``Nostradamus, Myth and
Reality: A Historian in the Time of Astrologers,'' published this
year by Editions Robert Laffont, he suggested reading all these
verses not as prophecies but as fascinating glimpses into a bygone
era and milieu.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the month of July 1999 is concerned,'' he wrote,
``when this book appears we'll be about to find out.''

 By DOUGLAS FRANTZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Feeding an almost insatiable demand for negative information in
today's world of bruising politics, private investigators are
playing a larger _ though mostly hidden _ role in the public arena,
digging up dirt on everyone from regulators to elected national and
small-town officials.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's use of private detectives has been widely
reported. But an examination by The New York Times found that over
the past decade they have moved into every corner of public life,
hired by politicians and their surrogates ranging from Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass., to the House Judiciary Committee chairman, Rep.
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and from the former mayor of New York, David
Dinkins, to aspirants for local city councils.
</P>
<P>
   The private investigators' thick reports usually are aimed at
discrediting critics and disposing of opponents. But they are also
used defensively, to identify and, if possible, to avoid potential
embarrassments.
</P>
<P>
   Today's breed of investigators include former police officers,
as always, but also former FBI agents, ex-CIA employees, former
prosecutors and, in a trend that raises new ethical questions,
ex-journalists, who can tap old news contacts to get negative
information published.
</P>
<P>
   Operating with little regulation or accountability, the
detectives spy on opponents by posing as reporters, or by sending
in operatives who work as volunteers in the campaign. In a world
where sensitive computer data can flow freely despite privacy laws,
some routinely obtain protected information ranging from phone
records to medical histories.
</P>
<P>
   They track down ex-spouses and former associates and employees,
often concealing the reason they are asking questions, and they go
through trash from offices, campaign headquarters and homes, a
practice known as ``Dumpster diving.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a garbage pail I won't get in, not an angle I
won't aim a hidden camera,'' said Larry Preston Williams, a former
police intelligence officer in New Orleans, who sends every
statewide candidate in Louisiana an offer to dig up ``white lies''
and other information about opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take cases from Republicans, Democrats, conservatives,
liberals,'' Williams said. ``It's all information.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how frequently private detectives are used in
political campaigns. The Federal Election Commission says it cannot
monitor campaign spending on them because payments are routinely
lumped with fees to lawyers. And journalists who cooperate with
detectives often promise confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has, however, begun to examine some of
the techniques that private investigators and information brokers
use to obtain confidential information. In April the Federal Trade
Commission filed a landmark suit against a Colorado investigator
over the use of deceptions known as pretexts to obtain information
about private bank accounts, and on June 25 state authorities
indicted him on racketeering charges. Congress is considering
legislation to outlaw pretexts.
</P>
<P>
   Personal attacks have been part of political campaigns since the
nation's inception. But for most of this century unwritten rules
kept within bounds what was called ``opposition research.'' The
typical investigator was a campaign worker or occasionally a
moonlighting police officer. Inquiries focused on public
information such as voting records and court cases.
</P>
<P>
   Those rules vanished after allegations of marital infidelity
drove Gary Hart out of the race for president in 1988. Campaigns
veered into nastier and more personal areas, and as they did,
professional investigators replaced the amateurs and techniques got
more aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy offered a rationale for hiring private investigators to
scrutinize his most recent opponent, Mitt Romney. ``Opposition
research is part of the modern campaign process,'' said a
spokesman, Will Keyser. ``In 1994, Sen. Kennedy's record was an
open book and his opponent's was largely unknown. It was important
and appropriate for the campaign to conduct thorough research into
all the available public information.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Rollins, a veteran Republican political consultant who
acknowledges using private investigators, said, ``Most people today
are trying to find as much dirt as they can.''
</P>
<P>
   This demand for dirt in politics arises during a boom era for
private investigators in the business world. Started by the
corporate takeovers of the early 1980s and fueled by computers,
corporate investigators have become an essential part of the
information economy. The spillover into politics was natural.
</P>
<P>
   But the best-known firms from the world of corporate snooping
say they avoid the political arena for fear that fallout from the
cases would damage their reputations and antagonize better-paying
business clients.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few major firms that solicits political cases is
Investigative Group International, the Washington company run by
Terry Lenzner, a former Watergate prosecutor. Though best known as
an investigator for Clinton's lawyers, he has also worked for
Republicans, including former Rep. Michael Huffington in his losing
Senate race in California against Dianne Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, Lenzner created a division called Campaign
Facts to specialize in political investigations. He also maintains
a tiny law firm, Terry F. Lenzner PC, which several former
employees said is used partly to provide politically sensitive
inquiries an extra layer of confidentiality through attorney-client
privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Lenzner was subpoenaed by Kenneth Starr, the
independent counsel, to testify before a grand jury about inquiries
into Clinton's critics and two of Starr's prosecutors. Lenzner said
he was not a target of the grand jury but, stung by the
controversy, now even he is considering cutting back on political
work.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Lenzner said political cases represent only a
fraction of the firm's revenue, though he defended such work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I perceive it to be analogous to a hostile takeover case where
we are hired by a company to gather information to convince
shareholders to vote for our client,'' he said. ``You are looking
at substantive issues that are relevant to the voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, the House Judiciary chairman, turned to a private
detective when a critic was trying to draw attention to his role in
a failed savings and loan.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, the detective, Ernie Rizzo, a former police
officer in a Chicago suburb, provided details of his work for Hyde
for the first time _ and described his disdain for politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians are the easiest people in the world to set up,''
Rizzo said. ``They're all whores. You stay with them for a week and
you'll catch them doing something _ women or money or something.
Forget about the millions spent in political campaigns. You don't
need that. Everybody got to the top by stepping over somebody. Find
the weakest link and attack it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rizzo, as a lone operator, is typical of detectives who handle
political work. A character who would be at home in a Damon Runyon
story, he is outgoing and flashy; his holographic business card is
emblazoned with the image of a spy and six phone numbers, including
one for his boat.
</P>
<P>
   Rizzo said he was hired in late 1995 by James Schirott, a lawyer
defending Hyde in a federal suit against him and other former
directors of Clyde Federal Savings and Loan. The thrift's 1990
failure cost taxpayers $67 million.
</P>
<P>
   Schirott, he said, told him the congressman was concerned about
a man turning up at hearings on the suit. Hyde wanted to know who
he was and what he knew. The lawyer gave Rizzo a name, Tim
Anderson, and an address in Libertyville, a suburb of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I did was I pulled phone records,'' Rizzo
explained. ``I saw Anderson was making 30 or 40 calls a day to the
media. I told Hyde, but he still didn't know who he was. I saw the
media calls, so I decided to pretend I was from the media.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he telephoned Anderson, claiming to be a producer for
``20/20,'' the ABC news program. Anderson agreed to meet him near
O'Hare International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Getting a target's phone records is often the starting point of
an inquiry, investigators say. While Rizzo was convicted of illegal
wiretapping in 1977 for taping conversations in divorce cases,
privacy experts say phone records fall into a gray area in most
states. Rizzo said he got the records from a source at a telephone
company, and the Illinois attorney general's office said no state
law was violated.
</P>
<P>
   A former banking consultant, Anderson had contacted dozens of
journalists trying to expose what he believed were the political
roots of the savings and loan scandal. Anderson said he gladly gave
Rizzo his material on Hyde _ a bound file containing 388 pages of
court records, newspaper articles and documents obtained through
the Freedom of Information Act.
</P>
<P>
   Among the documents were minutes of Clyde federal board meetings
that showed Hyde playing a more active role than he had
acknowledged publicly. In one instance, he approved an investment
in speculative options trading that eventually lost $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Rizzo, however, also wanted to know about Anderson, especially
any vulnerabilities he had. So, the detective said: ``I warned him
that Hyde was going to come after us and I had to make sure he
didn't have any skeletons. I got him telling me all his weak
spots.''
</P>
<P>
   Rizzo said he gave the file to Hyde and was paid by a political
ally of the congressman, not by his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, The Chicago Tribune disclosed Rizzo's duping of
Anderson. In his interview with The Times, Rizzo revealed that just
two months later, in December, he employed the technique again
because Hyde and his allies feared Anderson might use the
disclosure to disrupt the impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day before the impeachment trial started in the House, I
sent two guys back in,'' Rizzo said. ``They posed as reporters. We
wanted to know if Anderson was going to sue Hyde or make any other
noise. But he told them he wasn't going to sue. He was on a
crusade. It was hilarious.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde refused to be interviewed for this article, but a spokesman
disputed several aspects of Rizzo's account.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman, Sam Stratman, said Hyde was told that Anderson
had been investigated, but that Rizzo did not deliver his findings
to the congressman. Hyde never met Rizzo and had no knowledge of
his techniques, he said. Stratman said $2,000 of $20,000 in fees
paid to Schirott was for Rizzo's services. Schirott did not return
numerous phone calls from The Times over several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 the federal government settled its suit with the former
Clyde federal directors for $850,000. Hyde maintained he had no
responsibility for the thrift's failure and he did not contribute
to the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said the congressman's investigation had strengthened
his resolve. ``I'm an innocent member of the public and the head of
the Judiciary Committee hired a detective to spy on me,'' he said
indignantly.

   SUMMER-SCHOOL (Los Angeles) - Hoping to halt a practice that
many blame for Los Angeles' educational crisis, thousands of
teachers and students head back to class on Wednesday, the vanguard
of the school district's efforts to end social promotion. By the
end of August, 133,000 children in grades two through five will
have spent three weeks in a staggered series of summer school
sessions. By David R. Baker. (Will move in the ``n'' California

   ANTHRAX-MARINE (Los Angeles) - Instead of celebrating
Independence Day at a Hawaii military base, a former U.S. Marine
spent the holiday at his Los Angeles home over the weekend after
being discharged for refusing to take the controversial anthrax
vaccine. Pvt. Roman J. Lezo had been one of the first Marines to
face a court-martial prosecution in a small but growing armed
services protest. But military officials in Kaneohe, Hawaii instead
offered him a discharge under ``other than honorable
circumstances.'' By Phillip W. Browne. (Will move in the ``n''

   NEUTER-ELIGIBLE (Los Angeles) - Even as Los Angeles city
officials propose fining pet owners who fail to spay or neuter
their pets, the City Council is studying how to tighten eligibility
for low-cost altering. A string of vicious animal attacks by
roaming stray dogs prompted Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas to
propose an ordinance that would require pet owners to spay or
neuter their animals unless they pay a $100 fee.

 &HT;    No secrets as U.S. prepares to meet China for Cup title
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Their emotions spent to an even greater
extent than their bodies, members of the U.S. women's soccer team
have just enough time to kick back before the Great Wall of a team
known as China enters their frame of reference.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from midfielder Michelle Akers' perpetually creaking
bones, the Americans are in relatively good physical shape going
into the Women's World Cup final showdown Saturday in Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   The concerns of tournament organizers _ that there would be
plenty of empty Rose Bowl seats without the U.S. team playing for
the championship _ were alleviated as the dream matchup
materialized on Sunday. China crushed defending champion Norway
5-0, perhaps sending a message to an American team it has beaten
twice this year.
</P>
<P>
   A capacity crowd of more than 90,000 could be on hand to see if
both teams can match the thrills of their 1996 Olympic gold medal
match won by the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, who had a light workout late Monday afternoon in
Southern California, resume full training today following a
draining 2-0 semifinal win over Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly took a toll on both teams,'' U.S. captain Carla
Overbeck said. ``Every game has been physically and emotionally
exhausting for us. You could see a great sense of relief in that
locker room.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no one could use the rest more than the 33-year-old
Akers, who relentlessly hounded Brazilian star Sissi, got kicked in
the nose, received a huge gash in her thigh and scored the second
goal on a late penalty kick. She was also issued a yellow card
after dropping a pesky opponent in the final moments.
</P>
<P>
   But Akers, who needed a double IV afterward to combat the
effects of chronic fatigue syndrome, wouldn't have had it any other
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get to the point where you get as beat up as that,
another dink is not going to stop you,'' she said. ``It's sweet and
you want to savor it. This World Cup has been a battle.''
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest, and toughest battle yet looms. Chinese striker
Sun Wen and midfielder Liu Ailing, who have thrived against the
U.S., scored two goals apiece on Sunday. The Chinese have the
speed, skill and mental tenacity of the Americans, and the
confidence from winning twice in three meetings this year, most
recently a 2-1 victory at Giants Stadium in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really want to play either one of them,'' U.S. coach
Tony DiCicco said before learning the outcome of the China-Norway
match. ``We're going to take a deep breath and prepare for the next
one.''
</P>
<P>
   And the anxiety of getting to the final, which U.S. players
admitted has been something of a distraction, is now behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy about this for now,'' forward Mia Hamm said. ``We
are where we've wanted to be. We're going to Pasadena.''

CLINTON BEGINS TOUR OF HARD-PRESSED AREAS WITH PLEDGE TO THE NEEDY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky., Miss., Ill., S.D., Calif., Ariz.)   (nk) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAZARD, Ky. _ The Clinton Years have been lush for lawyers,
investment bankers and high-tech entrepreneurs. But pockets of
America remain largely untouched by the prosperity of the 1990s and
President Clinton is devoting much of this week to bringing them
compassion and new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Here in eastern Kentucky, where poverty and unemployment run two
to three times higher than the national averages, the president
Sunday presented a package of proposals intended to spur investment
among the idle coal fields. Clinton hopes to use federal tax
credits and loan guarantees to inspire private companies to build
plants and stores in Appalachia to serve a population that the
economic boom has largely passed by.
</P>
<P>
   It is a familiar strategy for this administration, except that
the proposed ``new markets'' are in economically distressed regions
of the United States, and not in Zimbabwe or the Ukraine. The
administration has aggressively used government tax breaks and loan
subsidies to encourage investment by American corporations in
developing countries, but has never focused similar efforts in a
systematic way on struggling communities in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though this is a blessed time for America, not all
Americans have been blessed by it,'' Clinton said before a
heat-wilted crowd in this mountain town. ``This is a time to bring
more jobs and investment and hope to the areas of our country that
have not fully participated in this economic recovery. We have an
obligation to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He picked the right place to make his point. David Deal, 58, a
laid-off medical supply worker from the depressed coal-mining town
of Cumberland, Ky., about 40 miles away, said that government
officials always talked about bringing jobs and investment to this
region, but the progress has all been backward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lyndon Johnson was here in '64 but all the things he was
talking about haven't reached down to the people here,'' Deal said.
``Clinton keeps talking about wanting us off welfare, but he hasn't
brought us any jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his neighbors, Darlene Hall, 41, said that she was
organizing a prayer rally in Cumberland next week to try to enlist
God in the search for employment. And if He's not listening, Ms.
Hall said she had a message for industrialists looking for a stable
work force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not pick-and-shovel uneducated people in the
mountains,'' she said. ``We are hard-working people, used to
working in the mines. We are educated and we want to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Trailing an entourage of corporate executives, members of
Congress, Cabinet officers and civil rights leader Jesse Jackson,
Clinton is embarked on a four-day, six-state tour of islands of
poverty among the general prosperity. He plans to visit Clarksdale,
Miss., a poor town in the Mississippi Delta; East St. Louis, Ill.;
the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota; a barrio in
Phoenix; and the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   He takes a briefcase full of what he hopes are programs to
create jobs: Community Development Financial Institutions; the
Community Reinvestment Act; empowerment zones and enterprise
communities; America's private investment companies; small business
investment companies; new markets venture capital firms; and new
markets lending companies.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the programs are intended to prompt as much as
$15 billion in investment in poor urban and rural areas over the
next five years. Most will require congressional action, but
Clinton has not yet sent all the specific legislation to Capitol
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have questioned the timing of the initiative, coming in
the seventh year of Clinton's presidency, when he longer has need
for the votes of suburban soccer moms or the financial support of
wealthy donors. He has spent countless days canvassing the
prosperous precincts of the nation over the last six and a half
years, bringing comfort to the comfortable and shoveling up
campaign contributions from equity-rich Democrats in Beverly Hills,
Silicon Valley, Manhattan and Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential aides said that Clinton spent his early years in
office insuring the general welfare through fiscal discipline and
targeted tax cuts that had cemented the fortunes of the middle
class. Now he can turn to the 35 million Americans who remain mired
in poverty as the tide of prosperity lifts the boats of others
around them, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that the country is doing so well right now may,
indeed, provide a better atmosphere for the president to put this
challenge to the private sector,'' said Gene Sperling, the White
House's chief economic adviser. ``In a period of prosperity like
this, a presidential message of bringing everybody along may be
more well received, and you may be able to do more good now than if
you were trying to do that at a time when the country, when
everyone around the country, was hurting.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced Monday $1.5 million in housing and economic
development grants to five eastern Kentucky groups from the
Department of Housing and Urban Development. The money is intended
to provide improved housing for migrant workers, job training and
subsidized mortgage loans, the department said.
</P>
<P>
   Before he spoke here in Hazard, Clinton stopped in Tyner, an
eastern Kentucky hamlet of mobile homes and 100 people in Jackson
County.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sought refuge from the wicked heat under a spreading
walnut tree and spoke with Jean Collett, 48, who recently left her
job as a cook at a Dairy Queen to care for her 69-year-old father,
Ray Pennington, who suffers from emphysema and breathes with the
aid of a portable oxygen tank.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sipped from a can of Mountain Dew and held Pennington's
hand as Mrs. Collett explained the hardships of life in their
pocket of Appalachia. Bank loans are hard to come by, she said,
because lenders demand collateral and she has none.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't even apply for them,'' she told the president.

DEPARTING OFFICIAL SAYS PRESENT AID CUTS MAY CREATE FUTURE CRISES  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The departing director of the government's major
foreign aid agency has criticized the Clinton administration for
allowing itself to be ``pushed around'' by Congress and warned that
congressionally-mandated cuts in foreign aid had created a crisis
for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, the director, J. Brian Atwood, took advantage of
his imminent departure as administrator of the Agency for
International Development to offer an unusually harsh assessment of
the administration and Congress, faulting them for an aid budget
that he called dangerously inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a crisis,'' said Atwood, who steps down on Friday
after six years at AID, which oversees economic and humanitarian
aid programs. ``There are a lot of people around the world who
depend on the United States, and we are just a very uncertain
trumpet right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Without a larger budget to help struggling nations, he said,
``you'll see democracies being defeated and radical leaders coming
into office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly,'' Atwood added, ``you could see more countries
becoming anarchies in Africa. You certainly could see that as a
possibility in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Clinton administration, the overall budget has declined,
from $14.1 billion in 1993, when Clinton took office, to $13.7
billion this year, a decline that is more dramatic when inflation
is factored in. The Agency for International Development staff has
been cut in that period one-third, to 7,000.
</P>
<P>
   A bill that the Senate passed on July 1 would reduce the budget
by an additional 6 percent next year, to $12.9 billion. The United
States spends less on foreign aid as a percentage of its gross
national product than any other developed nation.
</P>
<P>
   Atwood, a former career diplomat who has long been affiliated
with the Democratic Party, said the White House and State
Department understood the need for a larger aid budget, and he
praised Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the administration had overall not been willing to
put up enough of a fight against the Republican leadership in
Congress to restore money cut from the budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have allowed ourselves to be pushed around too much,'' he
said. ``I wish that we had expended more political capital.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House had no comment on Atwood's remarks.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Atwood also offered pointed criticism of Jesse Helms, the North
Carolina Republican who heads the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, accusing him of ``a negative exercise of power'' that
has hindered American foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   He also contended that a fringe of conservative lawmakers had
taken control of American policy toward the United Nations,
resulting in the United States' owing an estimated $1 billion in
back dues.
</P>
<P>
   Many U.N. critics in Congress, Atwood said, practice ``backdoor
isolationism'' and ``didn't have a passport and bragged about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In May, Atwood withdrew his nomination to become ambassador to
Brazil, saying that it was clear that Helms would never allow his
committee to consider the nomination. The two men had clashed over
Atwood's success in blocking the senator's plans to merge the
Agency for International Development into the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   ```I don't feel any malice toward Jesse Helms,'' Atwood said.
``I'm a fatalist about things, so I'm not angry in that sense.''
</P>
<P>
   But Atwood said that he had decided to speak out critically,
because ``I'm passionately concerned about the direction the world
is heading.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we've become complacent,'' he said. ``And I believe
a large part of it is because of a failure of American
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Helms, Marc Thiessen, had no comment on the
criticism. ``We wish him well in all his future endeavors,''
Thiessen said of Atwood.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Atwood said it was startling that, at a time of historic
prosperity here, economic research indicates that the world's poor
are actually losing ground. He pointed to statistics that the ratio
of rich to poor around the world is 65 to 1, or for every $65
earned in industrial countries, $1 is earned in poor ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're fat and happy,'' he said of the United
States. ``And we're growing very complacent, because we think we
hear a lot about the democratic revolutions around the world. But
what we don't hear about is this growing gap between rich and poor.
And that is a poisonous mix. That is going to create crises in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Atwood was also critical of the administration for not having
done more to defend the United Nations on Capitol Hill and to fight
for the full repayment of the back dues. The Senate has passed a
bill to repay $800 million in arrears in exchange for a commitment
that the United States will reduce its overall contribution to the
regular U.N. budget, from 25 percent to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use the word unconscionable,'' he said of the government's
treatment of the United Nations,'' the official said, adding that
the cuts forced on the United Nations had wreaked serious damage,
notably to the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees.
Atwood, who oversaw American humanitarian relief efforts in the
crisis in Kosovo, said the high commissioner's office had provided
``very bad leadership'' in the early weeks of the crisis, when
hundreds of thousands of Albanian refugees fled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The UNHCR was not doing its job in the early days,'' he said.
``They didn't have the resources. They didn't have the people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I say that their management failure was the direct result of
our failures in providing them with resources,'' Atwood said.
</P>
<P>
   Robyn Groves, a spokeswoman for the high commissioner,
acknowledged that ``there were major problems in the early days''
of the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We admit there were weaknesses,'' she said. ``I think that at
base you have to look at resources.''

   Japan's Executives Say Business Mood Improves
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese central bank's quarterly assessment of business
sentiment showed that the perception of business conditions among
more than 9,000 executives who responded in June was still
negative, but improving. But the survey's so-called diffusion index
remained solidly negative, meaning that pessimistic executives
still widely outnumbered optimists. The benchmark Nikkei index of
225 Japanese stocks rose 1.13 percent, to 18,135.06 _ its highest
close in 21 months.

   A new regulation from the U.S. Postal Service that requires
holders of private mail boxes to include the prefix p.m.B. in their
address has prompted a flurry of indignant letters to Congress. The
regulations also require box holders to submit their home addresses
to the post office. Around two million Americans rent boxes at
10,000 stores such as Pakmail and Mail Boxes Etc., often to lend
their business addresses prestige, sometimes because they have no
fixed address. Store owners and mailbox renters say the new rules
invade their privacy and pose a financial threat to their
businesses.

EX-SLA FUGITIVE'S PARENTS SHUN SPOTLIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BHAVNA MISTRY   AND CHARLES F. BOSTWICK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALMDALE, Calif. _ Trying their best to remain calm following
the arrest of their fugitive daughter, Martin Soliah said that he
and his wife have been taking daily walks in the desert, working in
the garden and doing calesthenics.
</P>
<P>
   After hiring their own attorney, the parents of Kathleen Soliah
said their daughter's imprisonment is troubling but they have their
own problems that they need to deal with _ without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take one-hour hikes in the desert daily,'' said Martin
Soliah, 81, standing at the front door of their Palmdale home,
about 55 miles north of Los Angeles. ``I do my calesthenics and she
works in the garden. We're just trying to stay busy and keep
ourselves occupied.''
</P>
<P>
   The spotlight turned on Soliah, a retired Palmdale High School
teacher and coach, and his wife two weeks ago when FBI officials
announced the arrest of Kathleen Soliah, living under an assumed
named in Minnesota and wanted on a 23-year-old warrant for two
attempted bombings of Los Angeles police cars in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Soliahs have talked little with the media since the
arrest, but have stressed their belief in the innocence of their
daughter _ with whom they said they have had sporadic contact since
she went underground in September 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI and Los Angles Police Department said the 52-year-old
mother of three, active in community theater and local politics in
Minnesota, was part of the Symbionese Liberation Army, the radical
group that kidnapped heiress Patricia Hearst in 1973. Most of the
SLA's members died in a fiery 1974 shootout with the LAPD.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Soliah said he has not been in contact with his daughter
or her family since her incarceration June 16 and said he has
learned no further details about his daughter's arrest or charges
against her.
</P>
<P>
   He said he and has wife aren't planning to tell their stories on
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``They give me letters, I never open them,'' said Martin Soliah.
``We'd never accept anything anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Soliah is being held by Minnesota authorities and is
scheduled for a July 15 extradition hearing to decide whether she
will be sent to California for trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would drop the charges if they had any sense,'' said
Martin Soliah. ``They told me they had nothing to hold her on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Soliahs said that their daughter, a 1965 Palmdale High
School graduate who moved to Berkeley after graduating from the
University of California, Santa Barbara, was never a member of the
SLA.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother told the Daily News after Kathleen's arrest that her
daughter only helped to hide the SLA's three surviving members _
Hearst and William and Emily Harris _ after the L.A. shootout, when
the three were convinced the FBI and police intended to gun them
down too.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Soliah had been friends with one of the slain SLA
members, Angela Atwood, whom she had met in the cast of a play and
worked with at a restaurant. Kathleen Soliah was one of the main
speakers in a Berkeley park at a memorial service for the slain SLA
members, and the surviving SLA members went to her for help, her
parents say.
</P>
<P>
   But Hearst _ who joined the SLA after it kidnapped her at age 19
from her Berkeley apartment _ told a different story.
</P>
<P>
   In the book she wrote after President Jimmy Carter pardoned her
for her bank robbery conviction, she wrote that Kathleen Soliah was
one of four masked robbers who held up a bank in a Sacramento
suburb in April 1975.
</P>
<P>
   A bank customer was killed by a shotgun blast, which Hearst said
was fired by Emily Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst said Stephen Soliah, Kathleen's brother, was a getaway
driver, and Mike Bortin, who is now married to a second Soliah
daughter, Josephine, was another gunman. At the time of the
robbery, Bortin had been paroled from jail after a conviction on an
explosives charge.
</P>
<P>
   Only Stephen Soliah, arrested with Hearst and the Harrises in
September 1975 in San Francisco, was tried for the bank robbery. He
was acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst said Stephen Soliah waited outside during the robbery but
prosecutors presented witnesses who said they saw him inside the
bank. The jury acquitted Stephen Soliah after the defense brought
in a bank customer who looked remarkably like him and testified
that he had come into the bank during the robbery, saw what was
going on and walked out.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1975, Hearst wrote, Kathleen Soliah, William Harris
and Jim Kilgore _ who remains a fugitive _ drove from the Bay Area
to Los Angeles with two pipe bombs. One they attached under a
parked police car in East Los Angeles, and the second to another
parked police car elsewhere in the city, Hearst wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The first fell off without exploding, prompting a police search
that found the second, Hearst wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Soliah said Kathleen was in Guatemala when the bomb was
planted.

CLINTON BEGINS TOUR OF HARD-PRESSED AREAS WITH PLEDGE TO THE NEEDY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky., Miss., Ill., S.D., Calif., Ariz.)  (Corrects day to Monday sted Sunday in 2nd graf)  
(nk) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAZARD, Ky. _ The Clinton Years have been lush for lawyers,
investment bankers and high-tech entrepreneurs. But pockets of
America remain largely untouched by the prosperity of the 1990s and
President Clinton is devoting much of this week to bringing them
compassion and new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Here in eastern Kentucky, where poverty and unemployment run two
to three times higher than the national averages, the president
Monday presented a package of proposals intended to spur investment
among the idle coal fields. Clinton hopes to use federal tax
credits and loan guarantees to inspire private companies to build
plants and stores in Appalachia to serve a population that the
economic boom has largely passed by.
</P>
<P>
   It is a familiar strategy for this administration, except that
the proposed ``new markets'' are in economically distressed regions
of the United States, and not in Zimbabwe or the Ukraine. The
administration has aggressively used government tax breaks and loan
subsidies to encourage investment by American corporations in
developing countries, but has never focused similar efforts in a
systematic way on struggling communities in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though this is a blessed time for America, not all
Americans have been blessed by it,'' Clinton said before a
heat-wilted crowd in this mountain town. ``This is a time to bring
more jobs and investment and hope to the areas of our country that
have not fully participated in this economic recovery. We have an
obligation to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He picked the right place to make his point. David Deal, 58, a
laid-off medical supply worker from the depressed coal-mining town
of Cumberland, Ky., about 40 miles away, said that government
officials always talked about bringing jobs and investment to this
region, but the progress has all been backward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lyndon Johnson was here in '64 but all the things he was
talking about haven't reached down to the people here,'' Deal said.
``Clinton keeps talking about wanting us off welfare, but he hasn't
brought us any jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his neighbors, Darlene Hall, 41, said that she was
organizing a prayer rally in Cumberland next week to try to enlist
God in the search for employment. And if He's not listening, Ms.
Hall said she had a message for industrialists looking for a stable
work force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not pick-and-shovel uneducated people in the
mountains,'' she said. ``We are hard-working people, used to
working in the mines. We are educated and we want to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Trailing an entourage of corporate executives, members of
Congress, Cabinet officers and civil rights leader Jesse Jackson,
Clinton is embarked on a four-day, six-state tour of islands of
poverty among the general prosperity. He plans to visit Clarksdale,
Miss., a poor town in the Mississippi Delta; East St. Louis, Ill.;
the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota; a barrio in
Phoenix; and the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   He takes a briefcase full of what he hopes are programs to
create jobs: Community Development Financial Institutions; the
Community Reinvestment Act; empowerment zones and enterprise
communities; America's private investment companies; small business
investment companies; new markets venture capital firms; and new
markets lending companies.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the programs are intended to prompt as much as
$15 billion in investment in poor urban and rural areas over the
next five years. Most will require congressional action, but
Clinton has not yet sent all the specific legislation to Capitol
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have questioned the timing of the initiative, coming in
the seventh year of Clinton's presidency, when he longer has need
for the votes of suburban soccer moms or the financial support of
wealthy donors. He has spent countless days canvassing the
prosperous precincts of the nation over the last six and a half
years, bringing comfort to the comfortable and shoveling up
campaign contributions from equity-rich Democrats in Beverly Hills,
Silicon Valley, Manhattan and Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential aides said that Clinton spent his early years in
office insuring the general welfare through fiscal discipline and
targeted tax cuts that had cemented the fortunes of the middle
class. Now he can turn to the 35 million Americans who remain mired
in poverty as the tide of prosperity lifts the boats of others
around them, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that the country is doing so well right now may,
indeed, provide a better atmosphere for the president to put this
challenge to the private sector,'' said Gene Sperling, the White
House's chief economic adviser. ``In a period of prosperity like
this, a presidential message of bringing everybody along may be
more well received, and you may be able to do more good now than if
you were trying to do that at a time when the country, when
everyone around the country, was hurting.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced Monday $1.5 million in housing and economic
development grants to five eastern Kentucky groups from the
Department of Housing and Urban Development. The money is intended
to provide improved housing for migrant workers, job training and
subsidized mortgage loans, the department said.
</P>
<P>
   Before he spoke here in Hazard, Clinton stopped in Tyner, an
eastern Kentucky hamlet of mobile homes and 100 people in Jackson
County.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sought refuge from the wicked heat under a spreading
walnut tree and spoke with Jean Collett, 48, who recently left her
job as a cook at a Dairy Queen to care for her 69-year-old father,
Ray Pennington, who suffers from emphysema and breathes with the
aid of a portable oxygen tank.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sipped from a can of Mountain Dew and held Pennington's
hand as Mrs. Collett explained the hardships of life in their
pocket of Appalachia. Bank loans are hard to come by, she said,
because lenders demand collateral and she has none.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't even apply for them,'' she told the president.

COMMENTARY: BACK TO A REPUBLICAN SYSTEM  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Kenneth Starr's Whitewater investigation ended in a lame
plea bargain last week, it was with an air of unreality that we
remembered what Starr had put this country through.
</P>
<P>
   A year of prosecutorial inquisition over the sexual antics of
Monica Lewinsky and Bill Clinton. Impeachment of the president. A
Senate trial. It all seems fantastic now _ and hard to believe that
a single prosecutor could have so distorted our constitutional
system.
</P>
<P>
   What drove Kenneth Starr? Many tried to puzzle out this bland
figure as he carried on his crusade. As good an answer as any, I
think, emerges from Bob Woodward's new book, ``Shadow.'' When Starr
announced in February 1997 that he was quitting as independent
counsel to go to Pepperdine University, his Republican friends
savaged him. He changed his mind _ and from then on was determined
to prove his mettle by getting President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A few months after his change of mind there was a revealing
clue. A Washington Post story by Woodward and Susan Schmidt said
that Starr prosecutors and investigators were asking Arkansas state
troopers what they knew about any extramarital sex by Clinton while
he was governor.
</P>
<P>
   When the story appeared, I asked Starr's Washington deputy, John
Bates, about it. He said it was distorted. The agents were just
trolling, he said, to find any acquaintances of Governor Clinton
who might know about Whitewater. I believed that representation by
an official I thought could be trusted _ and wrote a column
criticizing the story. I was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as the book convincingly shows, the Post account was an
understatement of what Starr had done. He had authorized his agents
to ask about sexual affairs _ even to ask whether one woman had had
a child who looked like Clinton. He was ready to use his
extraordinary prosecutorial power in that sleazy way in order to
destroy the president.
</P>
<P>
   The same unbounded zealotry showed up in the Lewinsky
investigation. Starr's deputies broke federal rules to keep Ms.
Lewinsky from her lawyer. They leaked lurid sexual tales to the
press. They questioned a girlfriend of Ms. Lewinsky's about what
she knew of the Lewinsky-Clinton relationship _ and published
irrelevant details of the friend's private correspondence with
members of her family.
</P>
<P>
   Starr used the feeble excuse of a grand juror's absence to
videotape the president's testimony so it could be played to the
country. Over his deputies' objections, he insisted on beginning
his impeachment referral to Congress with an extended pornographic
narrative.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of such abusive tactics was to shame the president and
arouse public opinion against him in the hope of driving him from
office. Fortunately for the future of our political structure, the
tactics failed. The American public was more outraged by Kenneth
Starr's abuses than disgusted by Bill Clinton's follies and
deceptions.
</P>
<P>
   But there was damage to the system. Starr went to court and
established precedents that give a president less privacy than any
of us would expect. He can no longer even talk in confidence to a
White House lawyer without fear that an antagonistic prosecutor may
some day make that lawyer testify about it.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, our republican system of political accountability
was distorted out of recognition. Instead of making a president pay
for misdeeds politically _ in Congress or at the polls _ we
subjected him to potentially mortal attack by an unelected and
unelectable prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment process itself was dangerously distorted. The
Constitution confides it to Congress. But here an unaccountable
prosecutor with unlimited resources ($40 million spent so far) used
his great power to help one party in Congress bring down a
president of the other party. Starr produced the witnesses, drafted
the charges and urged them on Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Independent Counsel Act reflected the delusion that the
condign process of the criminal law would make our democracy more
effective. What we got was the criminalization of our politics.
</P>
<P>
   Now the act has expired, and nearly everyone is relieved to have
it gone _ though Starr and others hang on as damaging ghosts. But
the work of restoring our constitutional institutions remains to be
done.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO and Russian military commanders resolved their
differences over Russia's role in the peacekeeping operation in
Kosovo on Monday, clearing the way for about 3,600 more Russian
troops to arrive in the Serbian province after weeks of wrangling.
</P>
<P>
   The first planeloads of Russian paratroopers could begin
arriving as soon as Tuesday at Kosovo's main airport west of the
capital, Pristina, alliance and Russian officials said. There they
will join several hundred Russian troops who have hunkered down
there since they entered Serbia on June 12, beating NATO
peacekeepers by hours.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last four days, NATO effectively grounded the next
incoming Russian paratroopers by persuading Hungary, Bulgaria and
Romania to deny Russia permission to fly through their airspace, a
move that rattled the already uneasy relations between the alliance
and Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Russia signed an agreement in Helsinki,
Finland, on June 18 to integrate the Russians into NATO's
operation. But the precise manner of how and where they would
operate and how they would report to NATO commanders became mired
in confusion, dispute and, some NATO officials suspected, intrigue
within the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   The military issues were settled Monday after two days of talks
in Moscow involving senior military officials for each side, led by
Russian Vice Adm. Valentin Kuznetsov, a senior official in the
defense ministry, and German Gen. Dieter Stockmann, who is chief of
staff to NATO's commander, Gen. Wesley Clark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, there are absolutely no military obstacles for the
deployment of the Russians,'' a NATO official in Brussels said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The final disputes involved the Russians' place in NATO's chain
of command and the exact areas within the American, German and
French sectors in Kosovo where the Russian troops would operate.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians agreed, with great reluctance, officials said, to
serve under the nominal control of the allied commanders of each
sector where they will operate: American, German and French
generals and, in the case of the airport, a British one. But the
Russians reserved the right to refuse to carry out orders.
</P>
<P>
   Russian commanders also sought but did not get permission to
send troops into the Italian sector, which would have altered
boundaries that had been negotiated in painstaking detail.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the difficulty in the talks stemmed from the fact that
after the Helsinki agreement, for reasons that are not clear, each
side had different maps showing different areas of operations for
Russia's troops, a Clinton administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the sense they were trying to reopen the Helsinki map,
but they essentially agreed to the map,'' the official said.
``There was just a little bit of confusion over what map.''
</P>
<P>
   For Russia, the involvement of its troops in making peace in
Kosovo has considerable significance, at home and abroad. After
Russia could do little to stop NATO's air war against Yugoslavia,
its traditional ally, the Russian deployment, beginning with the
surprise occupation of the airport, was seen as a boost to the
military's standing.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians are also eager to do what they can to help the
Serbs, who have cultural, religious and historic links to Russia.
The areas within Kosovo where the Russians are to patrol include
those where there have been concentrations of Serbs, many of whom
have fled in the wake of violent retribution by Kosovo's Albanian
majority.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Russia is ultimately to send up to 1,000 troops to the German
sector in the southwestern part of Kosovo, 600 to 800 to the
American sector in the southeast, and another 600 to 800 to the
French sector in the north.
</P>
<P>
   Within the French sector, the Russians wanted to operate in the
northern city of Mitrovica, where Serbs are trying to declare a
``Serbian zone'' to block the return of Albanians. NATO's
negotiators rejected that, the alliance officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A contingent of 750 Russians will occupy the province's main
airport in Slatina, near Pristina, providing maintenance and
security; NATO forces will control air traffic.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   With the Russians, the total peacekeeping force will eventually
total nearly 59,000. More than three weeks into the peacekeeping
mission, the NATO allies, along with a handful of other countries,
have sent in only about 29,000.
</P>
<P>
   The talks in Moscow dragged on for seven hours Monday and seven
hours on Sunday. And Russian and NATO officials said that despite
their agreement, they are likely to encounter more differences in
operational details in the weeks ahead.
</P>
<P>
   One possible area of future dispute is dual commands; under the
agreement, a parallel Russian chain of command will be established,
one that includes liaison officers in each sector, at NATO
headquarters in Kosovo, in Italy and at NATO's military
headquarters in Mons, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the structure was not all that different from the
arrangement for American troops, who operate under the British
officer in charge in Kosovo, Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson, but
ultimately answer only to the American commander-in-chief,
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   At NATO's insistence, the agreement specifies that any sector
commander can send other peacekeepers into the Russian areas of
operation to carry out any order the Russians refuse to follow, the
officials said. NATO leaders had feared that without such language,
the Russian areas could be seen as de facto enclaves for the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for an example of the type of order the Russians might not
carry out, the administration official cited the arrest of Serbs
accused of committing war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Russian refuse an order,'' the official said, ``the
commanders will be able to order somebody else to do it.''

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Immigration Counseling and Outreach Services, a nonprofit
agency assisting low income individuals with applications to the
INS, needs a newish computer (133 MHz processor) and laser printer
(at least 12 pages a minute). Donations are tax deductible (and can
be applied towards the donor's karma credit). _ Terri English
</P>
<P>
   A: Who can resist that kind of payoff? Readers , if you have
been itching to do good, here is your chance. Call executive
director English with your computer donations at (512) 451-8450.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My mom passed away leaving my younger sister and me as
co-executors of her will. My younger sister had durable power of
attorney to pay my mom's bills. She says there is no need to
probate the will, because her name is on all of mom's accounts and
the house was gifted to her. Is it legal not to probate a will and
have my sister divide up mom's accounts? Isn't a gifted house
taxable to my sister? As co-executor what are my responsibilities?
_ M.R.
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Under limited circumstances, if all family members with an
interest in the estate enter into a settlement agreement, it is not
necessary to have the will admitted to probate,'' advises attorney
Tom Barton, board certified in state planning and probate law.
However, you sound somewhat suspicious of your sister's actions, so
you should have the will admitted to probate. A co-executor has the
authority to investigate the circumstances surrounding the alleged
gift of your mother's home, as well as any transactions entered
into by your sister on behalf of your mother. If your mother made a
valid gift of her home, it will not be ``taxable'' to your sister,
but it will be necessary to file a gift tax return reporting the
gift in the appropriate calendar year. No federal gift tax would be
due unless your mother previously made other significant gifts. Q:
What can I do to discourage the onslaught of slugs and snails _
especially around the dogs' food bowls? _ V.L. Hall
</P>
<P>
   A: For a natural approach, the Herb Bar recommends placing a jar
lid of beer near the bowl to divert the critters. Given a choice,
snails and slugs prefer brewskie to H2O. However, should you notice
Fido also prefers the beer, you may have to use salt or
diatomaceous earth near the bowl. Unfortunately, DE and salt are
ineffective when wet.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My boys are itching for a Dallas Stars championship T-shirt!
The Stars Web page does not have T-shirts for sale _ a catalog, but
no mention of Stanley Cup merchandise. Help! They have watched the
Stars for years and stayed up till the very last game. Now they
won't let me rest until I find one. _ Monica Canestaro-Darby
</P>
<P>
   A: The NHL Web site has them. Surf over to www.nhl.com and check
out the product line: T-shirts to caps to a slice of the ice (1999
Stanley Cup Championship Clinching Game ice melted down and stored
in the clear plastic puck for a mere $39.99 _ hey, I do not make
this stuff up). Or, call (972) 831-2487. Either way, expect a long
delay before your memorabilia arrives, warns merchandising
assistant Leslie Turner. Demand. Demand. Demand. You San Antonio
Spurs fans, note apparel page http://store.nba.com or call (800)
711-3879.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the address of Lady Bird Johnson's daughter _ the one
who is married to Ian Turpin? (Lynda or Luci?) I want to ask her to
ask her mother to autograph a photo.
</P>
<P>
   _ J. Allison
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to the younger daughter of President Johnson, Luci
Baines Johnson, in care of KLBJ radio, a Johnson family enterprise,
8309 N. IH 35, Austin, TX 78753. Contact Jane Greig, author of

 &HT;    Wet whiners: The natural order returns
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ There are fewer kinds of rain in Central
Florida than in most places.
</P>
<P>
   This is a true fact, but you will have to take my word on it. I
can cite no study and know of no commission on raindrops. But see
if this doesn't square with your observations. Take your time,
though. Don't base it on one or two soggy afternoons. This could
take all summer.
</P>
<P>
   You will find that rain in Central Florida is a lot like a
malfunctioning bathroom spigot I used to wrestle with in an old
apartment. It either sprayed like a fire hose or stubbornly refused
to do anything. All the way on or shut off. Binary weather.
</P>
<P>
   I have lived in places where there were 28 kinds of rain, much
of it wimpy and indecisive. You got specks-on-the-windshield sun
showers, mere morning mists or winter drizzles.
</P>
<P>
   In those climes, you look hard at the spots on the sidewalk to
make sure you are being rained upon. No such questions confuse the
Florida pedestrian. If the parking lot hasn't flooded, it hasn't
rained. If your brakes work right away, it hasn't rained. Big rain
in big drops or nothing at all.
</P>
<P>
   Last year at this time, it was nothing. A bigger nothing than
anyone had seen for years.
</P>
<P>
   That was the summer of brown lawns in town and fire in the
forest. For more than a month, the sky regularly turned a garish
mix of pink and black. The woods around Interstate 95 looked like
the exit ramp to Hell's outer circles.
</P>
<P>
   In Daytona Beach, even the Pepsi 400, stock-car racing's sacred
solstice, was moved to the fall. The natural order was unhinged.
Summer across Florida disappeared in a cloud of smoke.
</P>
<P>
   That seems like a very long time ago. These are events that have
passed from CNN to the History Channel.
</P>
<P>
   I drive past the old fire zones these days and they shine green
in the wet. The palmettos, vines and ground brush have taken over
from the pines and stretch for miles. Their vibrant and excessive
green has taken over from the more muted and tasteful color schemes
of pine forests. Clumps of survivor trees huddle in small, defeated
groups and old, charred wood remains standing here and there like
the masts of shipwrecks.
</P>
<P>
   Only a year ago, this same place was a still-smoldering charcoal
sketch in blacks and grays. It was astounding how fast the green
took over.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the drive down this road seems longer now that large
chunks of forest have been erased. A comforting curtain of pine
used to hide the sad reality of encroaching new development, new
roads nearby, and the closeness of nearby traffic. Signs that warn
of impending gas stations and land for sale ominously popped up
after the charred timber was cleared.
</P>
<P>
   You drive out into this bright green open and the journey seems
longer because now you can see for miles.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not much for this open road. A tunnel through the trees
confers the comforting illusion of being miles from town. It fools
you into thinking you are really traveling. Actually going
somewhere, instead of merely schlepping across town.
</P>
<P>
   These flat miles of green only look like a ruin if you remember
what was there before.
</P>
<P>
   To a traveler, to someone who has forgotten the fire summer,
this looks like a fairly typical Florida roadscape.
</P>
<P>
   And it is easy to forget. People have been grousing about
steady, hard and regular afternoon rains. I feel simple-minded for
being thankful for it. For viewing with stupid satisfaction the
steam that comes off hot pavement in the drops of a downpour.
</P>
<P>
   Very bad things have to happen before people are grateful for
something as simple as rain. Which is why it is well to remember
what folks in this part of the state were doing this time last
year. Back when the interstates were jammed with evacuees. Back
when the area seemed like a firefighters' convention. Back when the
hardware stores were selling out of filter masks and air cleaners.
</P>
<P>
   If you have forgotten those events, you're likely to whine about
rain-outs over the 4th of July weekend.
</P>
<P>
   After a year, rain is once again an inconvenience and no longer
a deliverance. People are whining about the wet again. Which is how
things should be. Which is the natural order restored.

 &HT;    Better OS eases sharing, surfing
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Imagine a Mac that several users could share, with
each maintaining a different configuration of folders, applications
and even desktop patterns.
</P>
<P>
   What if that shared Mac could switch among these individual
configurations based on the voice of the user?
</P>
<P>
   Such power is part of the latest upgrade to the Mac OS, or
operating system, scheduled for release this fall. It will come
less than six months from the last upgrade, OS 8.6.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in the past 18 months, Apple has done a great job in
releasing regular and reliable upgrades to its OS. The OS controls
how your Mac works, from the look of the screen to how you navigate
through the hard disk. The better the OS, the more a Mac can do and
do well.
</P>
<P>
   The fall upgrade, code-named Sonata, will include major
improvements to the Mac's ability to support multiple users and Web
connectivity. Sonata will be released commercially as OS 8.7.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Apple Computer is saying little about Sonata. But
beta testers of this upgrade have been talking plenty with others.
Reports about Sonata and its key features are proliferating across
the Web, featured at such sites as Apple Insider, MacIntouch and
Webintosh.
</P>
<P>
   Following is a summary of the most reliable information gleaned
about Sonata from these sites.
</P>
<P>
   Sonata's biggest change will be an expanded ability for Macs to
handle multiple users. With Sonata, several people will be able to
share a Mac and keep separate, password-protected work
environments.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, no one but you _ or a system administrator if
your Mac is on a network _ will be able to change your setup. Among
the things you'll be able to customize will be look, file access
and Internet configuration.
</P>
<P>
   You can sign onto a Mac configured for multiple users via a
written password or through voice recognition. Sonata will include
a new control panel called Voice Password Assistant.
</P>
<P>
   With Voice Password, you select a spoken code word and say it
until the system understands your voice and the code word. Then a
user can sign onto a Mac by selecting his or her name and saying
the correct password.
</P>
<P>
   Another OS feature getting an overhaul is Apple's new Sherlock
search technology. Sherlock lets users search not only their hard
drive but the Internet from their computers.
</P>
<P>
   Sonata will add two new important searches to Sherlock. The
first is for people. Sherlock will search via the Web telephone
numbers and e-mail addresses. What it finds will be listed on your
computer in the Sherlock window.
</P>
<P>
   The second new search is for e-commerce. Type the name of a
product into Sherlock, and it will search the Web for varying
prices and availability of the product, listing the results on your
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Many more changes are coming with Sonata, many of which are
minor enhancements and bug fixes. To learn more about this upgrade,
check out Apple Insider at www.appleinsider.com
/macos8.7.shtmlreports.

 &HT;    Dreaming of a washtub on a hot summer day
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ It was hot when I crawled into the hammock
last night, and it was still hot when I rolled out this morning.
That's where I sleep in warm weather _ in the treetops in a hammock
_ on an upstairs back porch that I had screened a few summers ago
to take advantage of cool northern nights.
</P>
<P>
   But for the past couple of days, the sun, usually little more
than a benign alarm clock or an occasional clothes dryer, has
become my enemy. It is relentless in its daily attempts to fry my
brains, and as the temperature soars, so does my annoyance level.
</P>
<P>
   This morning when the fireball's first rays spit into my
sleep-stuck eyes, I woke up overheated and swearing. Not a good way
to begin the day, I decided, so I lingered for a moment to have a
talk with myself.
</P>
<P>
   Self: Why are you so crabby?
</P>
<P>
   Crab: Because I'm HOT!
</P>
<P>
   Self: Big deal. You grew up in south Florida before air
conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Crab: It's not supposed to be (SET ITAL)this(END ITAL) hot (SET
ITAL)this(END ITAL) far north.
</P>
<P>
   Self: Aww, get over it. Why not do what you did as a kid to keep
cool?
</P>
<P>
   Crab: You've got to be kidding. I don't even have a washtub.
</P>
<P>
   Bettye Harris and I grew up next door to each other in Miami. We
were the same age and went to the same school. We liked the same
music, the same food, and on occasion, even the same boy. And
Bettye had a washtub.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the old days (mid- to late-'40s), before slick
developers had folks believing that a house was not a home without
a swimming pool in the back yard, the typical south Florida place
came pool-less as well as central heat- and air conditioning-less.
There was an ocean for swimming, a sun for heat (we even used solar
panels for hot water), and come evening, the open windows let in a
welcome breeze. That was nature and we pretty much left it alone.
</P>
<P>
   But for little kids, it wasn't enough. We wanted the beach in
our back yards. We had a canal, but of course we weren't allowed to
swim in it because it had snakes, gators, and a swift current. It
was, after all, run-off from the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   Venetial Pool was beautiful but too long a bike ride, and the
ocean was a bus and jitney away, so until we were older, those
options were out of the question. We had to make do with what we
had _ and that was usually the Harris's old washtub.
</P>
<P>
   Lazy afternoons, Bettye and I would be kicked back somewhere in
the shade, wishing we were 16 and had curly hair, when one of us
would come up with the idea. ``Wanna' play in the washtub?'' That
was our signal to spring into action. Bettye would head for her
dad's old slat-house and come dragging the galvanized tub across
the lawn by one handle. I'd pull over our garden hose, the one
connected to the well my father had dug for watering the yard. That
way we could let our ``ocean'' run without being reminded by our
parents that we weren't buying stock in the City of Miami's water
department. While the tub filled, we ran home for bathing suits and
towels.
</P>
<P>
   With a striped beach towel and an unlimited imagination, we'd
manage to turn our side yards into South Beach _ the place where
really cool high school kids with jalopies hung out making awkward
boy-girl talk and building human pyramids on the sand. As Bettye
and I folded ourselves into the washtub, arms and legs dangling
over the side into the itchy broadleaf St. Augustine grass, we'd
talk about what we imagined life would be like in three or four
years when we were old enough to ride in boys' cars and be a part
of the beach scene. We must have been quite a sight _ two scrawny
kids curled up in a No. 9 tub beating the heat and dreaming of a
life far beyond its rim.
</P>
<P>
   Today is plenty hot enough and I can't help wondering if one of
my friends has a washtub to fit. I'd supply the dreams.

 &HT;    Global stomachache awaits
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This used to be a dangerous time of year for stomachs.
Backyard family reunions and church picnics often threatened
gastronomic health because Aunt Mabel would set out her potato
salad in the warm sun while grandpa was busy undercooking the
hamburgers.
</P>
<P>
   But because of growing awareness of food poisoning, most people
now know to put the mayo dishes back in the cooler and scorch the
burgers until they're black.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, our food worries are far from over. In fact, in
the next century, we may face even more digestive threats because
of several factors, including the expanding global food trade,
rising use of pesticides, mass processing of meats and increasing
reliance on genetic manipulation of seeds and animals.
</P>
<P>
   Food safety was simpler 50 years ago when most Americans stuck
to diets centered around meat, potatoes, peas and carrots. Milk was
produced on local dairy farms and no one expected to eat fresh
strawberries in January.
</P>
<P>
   But our food choices have been expanding as more people have
moved here from Latin America, Asia, Africa and the Caribbean,
bringing with them a taste for different kinds of fruits, fishes,
vegetables and spices. With Thai restaurants now opening in
suburban shopping centers and salsa replacing ketchup as the most
popular condiment, even Mayflower descendents are switching from
pot roasts to ``foreign'' foods.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, rising affluence has spurred the demand for
imports. Not so long ago, slicing a banana into a bowl of cereal
was something of a luxury. Today, many consumers think nothing of
spending several extra dollars at the grocery store to brighten up
a winter breakfast of hot oatmeal with fresh berries from Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   In response to such demands, U.S. food importers are buying
massive quantities of grapes from Chile, cheeses from France, apple
juice from China, strawberries from Mexico and so on. Already
imports account for about a fifth of all we consume; experts expect
that figure to rise as more sophisticated communications systems
help link food producers with grocers.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, along with this increase in imports, we have seen
a rise in poisonings. In recent years, food-borne illnesses have
been traced to cantaloupes, raspberries and scallions from Central
America.
</P>
<P>
   But growers in poorer countries aren't the only ones who create
potential dangers. As the recent health-scare involving Coca-Cola
demonstrated, Europeans are deeply concerned about products they
perceive as ``American.'' They especially don't want to consume our
Made-in-the-USA genetically altered tomatoes or our growth-hormone
laden beef. Europeans consider much of what we eat to be unnatural
``Frankenstein food.''
</P>
<P>
   They also have good reason to fear U.S. pesticides. Consumers
Union, a nonprofit watchdog group, recently found that when it
compared foreign and American produce using USDA databases from
1994 to 1997, the U.S. crops almost always had higher levels of
pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   In the new century, consumers enjoying the benefits of the
global grocery store of the techno age may well end up exposing
themselves to more pesticides, hormones, bacteria and genetically
altered foods.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most important issues for world leaders to settle in
coming years will be the development of global systems to oversee
the uniform labeling of food products, the settling of scientific
disagreements about health risks and the inspection of foods.
</P>
<P>
   All of that will be complicated and expensive, but will remain a
far better alternative to going back to green beans and meatloaf.

 &HT;    AltaVista opened new world that kept changing too fast
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Oh AltaVista, we hardly knew ye.
</P>
<P>
   AltaVista (www.altavista.com) is the search engine purchased
last week by Massachusetts investment group CMGI from Compaq for
$2.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   AltaVista was around long before The New York Post was calling
CMGI Chairman David Wetherell the Warren Buffett of the Internet.
It was there long before Wetherell was holding press conferences
announcing plans to use AltaVista as a platform to showcase CMGI's
other Internet holdings. Yes, AltaVista was something besides an
annoying portal site that the cash-strapped computer company wanted
to unload. It was one of the first search engines that really,
truly searched the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Developed by a group of engineers at Boston-based Digital
Equipment Corp., AltaVista debuted in the mid-'90s to an awestruck
audience of Web surfers. A columnist for the online 'zine Suck
(www.suck.com) raved about the joys of typing in the names of
long-lost friends and having the search engine turn up more
information than she could have found had she hired a private
dectective.
</P>
<P>
   Before it became common for a typical Internet search to turn up
20,000 entries to match even the most obscure topics, AltaVista was
turning up information and Web sites people didn't know existed.
AltaVista topped nearly everyone's bookmark list. Sometimes even
the totally unrelated personal home pages a search would turn up
were interesting.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine in 1999 how amazing it was to just type in
anything you wanted to find, anything you needed to know and have
this search engine track down not just two or three but thousands
of Web sites. In those days, it was quantity, not quality that
mattered, and AltaVista got the job done.
</P>
<P>
   But the Web experienced growing pains, and so did AltaVista. The
folks at Digital bought the rights to use the name AltaVista from a
software company in California, which shrewdly sold the computer
maker everything but the Web address, www.altavista.com. Because of
this, the search engine was forced to use the Web address
www.altavista
</P>
<P>
   .digital.com. Meanwhile, AltaVista the software maker was
gathering up millions of hits from innocent users looking for the
hot new search engine. Eventually Digital filed a lawsuit. The
results of that suit are obvious each time you type in
AltaVista.com and get the search engine, not a software company.
</P>
<P>
   Nifty as AltaVista was, times began to change. Business on the
Web is a little like the weather in New England _ if you don't like
it, just wait a minute. In 1997, a smallish search engine called
Lycos took a considerable amount of floor space at Internet World
in New York to demonstrate a new version of its search engine that
would return what it determined were the best sites on any specific
topic instead of every last site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who wants 30 million Web sites about the New York Knicks?''
they asked. ``What you need is three really good sites about the
New York Knicks.'' As it turned out, Lycos and Yahoo! and Snap and
all the search engines that followed began to direct users to sites
that were picked by people, not by a computer keyword search.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the novelty of AltaVista's pages of searches began to wear
thin. Digital's intital refusal to accept advertising on the site
while Yahoo! was loading a banner advertisement on nearly every
page didn't help much. While Yahoo! was establishing itself as one
of the hottest sites on the Web to search and to do business,
AltaVista was going nowhere fast.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being somewhat behind the curve as the search engine
evolved into a ``portal site'' that promised to do everything for
the user except make dinner, AltaVista remained one of the top
sites on the Web. In May 1999, it was the 10th most popular site,
according to Web measurement firm Media Metrix, thanks in part to
the eventual addition of translation software and the typical
``sticky'' portal products such as shopping, yellow pages, e-mail
and stock quotes.
</P>
<P>
   Wetherell told reporters that AltaVista, under CMGI's
leadership, will become a ``megaportal.'' The site will put more
emphasis on online shopping and intelligent agent technology that
will help identify consumer habits in the hopes of sending them to
the goods and services they are most likely to want. Sound
familiar?
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, we thought so. It sounds like just about every other
Internet site from Yahoo! AltaVista is just going to be another
search engine vying for the eyeballs, ad dollars and disposable
income of the ever-growing Web-surfing public.
</P>
<P>
   The days of the geek-driven search engine are gone. It was
probably inevitable. Besides, who has the time to wade through
thousands of listings that may or may not contain the information
you need?
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see what CMGI has in store for
AltaVista as it gets a millennium face lift and showcases some of
the CMGI Web sites. The Web's big winners focus now on helping busy
people get things done. But the days of random searches for obsure
information aren't totally over _ there's still eBay.

 &HT;    Screen time is big time
 &HT;    By Staff reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ American kids spend more time watching television and
playing video and computer games than they do in school, a new
study says. On the average, children spend 4 1/2 hours every day in
front of a screen, which adds up to 1,642 hours a year. The average
child spends 1,000 hours in school each year.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that nearly half of all homes with kids ages 2
to 17 have at least one television, a VCR, video game equipment and
a home computer. Three out of every five children ages 12 to 17
have a TV set in their rooms. The national study was conducted by
the Annenberg Public Policy Center.
</P>
<P>
   Dole running for president
</P>
<P>
   Republican Elizabeth Dole threw her hat into the ring last week
to run for president next year. She is the first Republican woman
to run for that office.
</P>
<P>
   Dole has been the secretary of transportation, the secretary of
labor and president of the American Red Cross. Her husband, former
Sen. Bob Dole, ran unsuccessfully for president three times.
</P>
<P>
   Ten Republicans have entered the race so far. They include Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, former Vice President Dan Quayle, Sen. John
McCain from Arizona and magazine publisher Steve Forbes. Bush, the
son of former President Bush, is leading in polls and in
fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Does Earth have a `twin'?
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere out there, the Earth may have a ``twin'' planet
capable of supporting life, according to a report in the journal
Nature.
</P>
<P>
   David Stevenson of the California Institute of Technology said
Earth may have had one or more siblings when the solar system was
born, but they were thrown far away by gravity when they got too
close to Jupiter or other large planets.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson said these Earth-like planets may be capable of
supporting life, despite their distance from the warmth of the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists agree that planets probably were ejected from
the solar system. But they have no idea whether they could support
life.

 &HT;    Linking convenience to high-tech key for businesses
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In the digitally intertwined future, when the
Internet is expected to beckon to us from everywhere all the time,
NCR Corp. may have a way to capitalize on those minutes wasted
while waiting for the microwave to heat leftover linguine.
</P>
<P>
   NCR's Microwave Bank would allow electronic banking and shopping
with a touch screen in the oven door.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kitchen is often the most frequently used room and
provides a versatile environment that is no stranger to
sophisticated consumer products,'' NCR's Knowledge Lab explains.
``We are exploring the evolution of one of the most familiar
devices in the kitchen _ the microwave.''
</P>
<P>
   Still in the testing phase, this convergence of old and new
appliances symbolizes the novel approaches companies are
considering to cash in on what PC visionary Michael Dell predicts
will be an ``information-addicted'' populace.
</P>
<P>
   Cheap and convenient devices will turn the masses into
digiterati, a term for well-equipped users, who will be able to buy
and sell stock, update the grocery list, avoid traffic jams, and
check weather, sports scores and e-mail while miles from their
personal computer back home.
</P>
<P>
   It's about connected convenience, say industry experts, and the
winners will be those products that conform to users' wants and
needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In less than five years there will be more non-PC devices than
PCs connected to the Web,'' predicted Ann Marie Deroux, director of
IBM Corp.'s speech-recognition division.
</P>
<P>
   A sampling of how different high-tech industries are addressing
the dawning of the Post PC Era:
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications and Internet Service
</P>
<P>
   In the post-PC era, the services and content of computer
networks, especially the Internet, become more important than the
devices that tie into the network.
</P>
<P>
   With that ``network-centric'' approach to the future, companies
involved in making communications equipment, providing
communications services or delivering Internet content are
preparing for a big surge in business.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what a few of the big players are doing:
</P>
<P>
   _Cisco Systems and other network equipment makers are rushing to
build the equipment that runs tomorrow's high-speed, Internet-based
communications networks that will handle both voice and data.
</P>
<P>
   _Internet giants America Online Inc. and Prodigy Communications
Corp. are making deals with key allies. Last week, both companies
began offering free computers to customers who agree to pay for
extended Internet service. AOL has also signed a deal to invest
$1.5 billion with Hughes Electronics to enhance the marketing of
high-speed Internet access by satellite. A Hughes subsidiary,
DirecPC, delivers Internet service by satellite.
</P>
<P>
   _Big telecom companies are jockeying for position. AT&AMP;T Corp.,
for instance, recently acquired two major cable systems, Media One
Group and Tele-Communications Inc. With the deals, AT&AMP;T is in
position to deliver local phone service, high-speed Internet
service, long-distance service and television programming all in
one package.

 &HT;    Internet connections computer makers' new focus
 &HT;    By Kirk Ladendorf
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Bill Goins' laptop computer was a seemingly
indispensable tool.
</P>
<P>
   He lugged the Apple PowerBook 2400 across the country on
business trips, keeping in touch with his office via e-mail,
checking his calendar for meeting schedules and checking a database
for the phone numbers of business contacts.
</P>
<P>
   But when his laptop was stolen from an Idaho hotel room several
months ago, Goins had something to take its place, a brand-new
machine that fits in the palm of his hand.
</P>
<P>
   His new Palm VII hand-held computer _ which fits into a category
of products called personal digital assistants _ provides almost
everything his laptop did. With it, he has wireless access to the
Internet, e-mail, news headlines, meeting schedules, phone numbers
and even airline information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no longer tethered to that ball and chain that was my
computer,'' said Goins, who is part of a test group for the Palm
VII. The device won't be sold nationally until later this year.
``With this, I can do the majority of what I do in the office
wherever I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Change is sweeping through the computer industry and users like
Goins are in the vanguard.
</P>
<P>
   Personal computers _ be they desktops or laptops _ are still a
necessary part of life. But their role in the digital world is
changing.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, tech companies are focusing not on the machines,
but how they connect to the increasingly ubiquitous Internet. And
as hand-held computers and similar devices become more common, more
users like Goins will be untethering themselves from their old PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers predict that hand-held computer device sales will
increase by a dizzying 47 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, traditional PCs' sales are expected to increase
by about 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the newest Internet-access tools look like Goins'
hand-held device. Wireless phones now allow Internet access. Pagers
can send e-mail. And in the future, look for everything from
kitchen appliances to automobiles connected to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   New PC alternative devices are expected to be used in 18 million
households by 2003, according to Forrester Research, of
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Technology executives say what the numbers don't.
</P>
<P>
   IBM Chief Executive Louis Gerstner wrote shareholders in this
year's annual report that ``The PC Era is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems Chairman Scott McNealey calls it the start of
the Post PC Era.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, in a move that spoke louder than words, CompUSA
Inc. Chief Executive James Halpin announced that the Dallas-based
retailer would start selling more PDAs and other portable devices
and fewer lower-profit PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone buys the idea that the PC is going to subside in
importance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that the PC is going away is a bunch of B.S.,''
Michael Dell, who founded the world's most profitable PC company,
said recently.
</P>
<P>
   But even Round Rock-based Dell Computer Corp. is changing the
way it does business.
</P>
<P>
   Dell today is emphasizing the Internet capabilities of its
computers. It is pushing harder than ever for alliances with
companies that deliver high-speed Internet access, and it will
deliver more consumer services, products and technical support over
the Net. Dell is also following rival Gateway 2000 in creating its
own Internet delivery service for customers.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent meeting with analysts, Michael Dell predicted just
how important the ongoing Internet revolution will be to his
company.
</P>
<P>
   In 10 years, he predicted, 1.4 billion PCs will function not as
desktops, but as servers for 14 billion Internet devices ranging
from hand-held computers to televisions. That would equate to about
two devices for everyone on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of the changing PC business, last week two major
providers of Internet access, America Online Inc. and Prodigy
Communications Corp., announced that they would offer consumers
free PCs _ if they agree to sign up for extended online service
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Services are eclipsing products,'' said Eric Schmitt, an
analyst with Forrester Research. ``The Internet-related service
over the wire is becoming more valuable than the hardware at the
end of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Rob Enderle, an industry analyst at Giga Information Group
Inc.: ``We are at the front end of the most significant change that
has occurred in the computer industry since the emergence of the
PC.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of turns the computer hardware industry on its ear.''
</P>
<P>
   A new era Crucial to the post-PC era are high-speed computer
networks.
</P>
<P>
   Cable television systems are being outfitted to deliver
high-speed Internet service. Telephone systems are starting to
offer advanced Digital Subscriber Line service capable of
delivering the Internet at speeds that are 20 to 100 times faster
than today's conventional modems.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester projects that at least 20 million American homes will
have high-speed Internet access by 2003, compared with less than 1
million today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The driving force going forward is bandwidth _ how fast a
connection you have to the Internet,'' said analyst David Goldstein
of Channel Marketing Corp. of Dallas. ``It's bandwidth, baby.''
</P>
<P>
   High-speed wireless networks are also in the offing. A group of
leading electronics and communications companies are collaborating
in a consortium called Bluetooth to develop a common and cheap way
to enable electronic devices, from computers to wristwatches, to
connect wirelessly to the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester estimates that consumers in the United States will pay
more for their Internet service in 2001 _ a projected $16.5 billion
_ than they will for computer hardware.
</P>
<P>
   No one is predicting that desktop and laptop PCs will be
completely replaced anytime soon by smaller hand-held devices. But
prices for PCs are expected to decline.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester, for example, projects that average prices for
computers will drop $400 more by the year 2003. Lower prices will
translate to lower profits, driving some weak players from PC
manufacturing and forcing other companies to broaden their lines of
products and services.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say more efficient PC makers like Dell will fare better
than competitors, but they expect that the entire PC hardware
industry will feel the impact of slowing sales and falling prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great joy in the PC hardware business is over,'' said
analyst Roger Kay with IDC Research in Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Goins, who has worked in the personal computer industry for
nearly two decades, doesn't expect conventional PCs to disappear
any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he is fond of his hand-held device, he still makes
extensive use of his desktop machines at the office and at his home
in Northwest Austin.
</P>
<P>
   But Goins does expect that alternative smart products, such as
his hand-held device, will continue to get better and better.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a wonderful device,'' he said of his Palm VII. ``But
it's just the beginning.''

 &HT;    Special laptop found in hunt of computer show's treasures
 &HT;    By Gerry Yandel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This was originally supposed to be a column about
what's new in SVGA, the future of computer visuals and how the glut
of cheap chips means you can build a workaday home PC around your
monitor.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before I stumbled into heaven for a few hours last
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Heaven, it turns out, was in the Cobb County Civic Center.
</P>
<P>
   A flier had come in the mail for the Atlanta Area Computer Show
this past Saturday and Sunday. I tend to avoid any ``shows'' that
charge you to spend your own money, and this one cost $5 to get in,
$6 for both days.
</P>
<P>
   But because it was pouring rain, and I had never been to one of
them, I decided to go see what it was all about.
</P>
<P>
   When I parked, I noticed there were a lot of people carrying
computer cases and boxes of other stuff out to their cars. I had
half a notion that maybe I'd stumble across a cheap, old 486 or
something similar, so I took my checkbook.
</P>
<P>
   Oops.
</P>
<P>
   I had never been inside the Cobb Civic Center before. After
shelling out the five bucks, I found myself looking at a row of
tables that followed the perimeter of the building. The tables were
overflowing with every manner of hardware, software and
everything-in-between-ware.
</P>
<P>
   Wait, it gets even better.
</P>
<P>
   Those tables all overlooked the civic center floor, where there
were several more rows of tables full of stuff: glittering green
circuit boards, racks of CD-ROMs, boxes full of video accelerators,
sound cards, modems, network hubs, chips, cases, books.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing I don't recall seeing was a mousepad, which
somehow lent an air of authenticity to the show.
</P>
<P>
   I was standing at the rail, looking down on this Dragoncon for
gearheads, when I spotted the tableful of laptops.
</P>
<P>
   Oops.
</P>
<P>
   I had been thinking for some time that I needed a laptop, but
every time I looked at an ad, even the mom-and-pop outlets were
getting upward of $1,200 for new models.
</P>
<P>
   I knew what I wanted: a portable that could handle Word, for
desktop publishing stuff; Ultraedit, text editor I use for HTML;
Photoshop, for graphics work; Netscape, for, well, everything; and
all my little Internet toys, like WS-FTP, mIRC, Agent, etc.
</P>
<P>
   I'd also need a modem PC card, and I wanted a Pentium-class
machine with as much storage as possible.
</P>
<P>
   So I headed down the steps, merely to see what they had on that
tableful of laptops.
</P>
<P>
   The show was wondrous. It was a digital flea market ... and most
of the stuff was priced to sell quickly.
</P>
<P>
   One grandmotherly woman had a table full of plastic bins holding
nothing but computer cables of every shape, size, width and
persuasion. A friendly guy with a few display racks of CD-ROMs had
bargain-bin prices on current versions of big-name software, like
Win 95a and Win 95b (for those of us who avoid Win 98) and
two-for-ones on those CDs they use as filler (just think MultiMedia
Joke Kit) in retail store software bundles.
</P>
<P>
   There were tables of nothing but motherboards ... past and
present. Some vendors dealt in antiques, and if they didn't have
your particular obscure item, they knew who on the floor did. (One
poor guy was selling brand spanking new midtowers with 400 MHz and
450 MHz chips starting at over $1,000. Nobody stopped at his
table.)
</P>
<P>
   I was there for laptops. That first table I spotted had older
Pentiums from 75 MHz up to about 133 MHz for anywhere between $425
and $750. Some had external CD-ROMs, others had no CD drive at all.
There were familiar brands and totally obscure brands. All of them
weighed a lot.
</P>
<P>
   I ferreted out another laptop dealer with some nice-looking
Apple powerbooks, but apparently even old Macs cost too much. A
third dealer had the one I ended up buying _ a titanium-encased
Panasonic MKIII CF-41 that you could use to hammer in a nail.
</P>
<P>
   It has a built-in floppy drive, built-in CD-ROM (under the
keyboard, which may or may not be a good thing), a 1-gig hard
drive, 16 megs of RAM, Win 95b and Office 97.
</P>
<P>
   A 75 MHz version of it was on the table priced at $475, but the
dealer also had a 120 MHz version off to the side that he was
testing out with ``You Don't Know Jack 2.'' He said he'd give me
that one for $500.
</P>
<P>
   Oops.
</P>
<P>
   I also had to find someone selling PCMCIA modem cards, and
picked up a Compaq 28.8 and pigtail cable for $35.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the hardware for sale, the laptop came without
paperwork and the bare minimums: a power adapter and two power
cables (but a docking station was a nice plus).
</P>
<P>
   In all, a pretty neat deal, I thought. And this time I
remembered to boot up before signing the check.
</P>
<P>
   The show returns in August and September.
</P>
<P>
   There's also supposed to be a larger version at the Georgia
National Fairgrounds that I want to shop.
</P>
<P>
   When I got home, I stuck the laptop in my shoulder bag, grabbed
the docking station and met my wife coming out the door on her way
to work.
</P>
<P>
   Oops.

 &HT;    Suite deal: The right office software can make business jungle a
garden
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They're called ``office suites,'' but this type of
software is more like a warehouse, offering features in bulk.
</P>
<P>
   No longer do these suites simply let you write memos and analyze
numbers. With these programs you can now add complex tables to
reports, convert numbers into colorful 3D charts and publish
documents on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   While powerful, these programs are also overwhelming. Your eyes
glaze over reading down the list of features. How, then, do you
choose which one is right for you or your business?
</P>
<P>
   To help guide your decision, we took a close look at the latest
versions of the top three office suites: market leader Microsoft
Office 2000, WordPerfect 2000 and SmartSuite Millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The three are more alike than different. Each includes a word
processor, spreadsheet, a limited personal information manager,
presentation software and a database.
</P>
<P>
   To varying degrees of success, each of these programs lets you
paste a spreadsheet in a report, add written notes to spreadsheets
or publish database numbers in a document table.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, each program offers toolbars of buttons that let
you automate routine tasks. At the click of a button you can add
styles to a document, correct spelling errors and total up columns
of numbers.
</P>
<P>
   WordPerfect and SmartSuite also will easily read and convert
Office 2000 documents. Neither program could survive as an Office
alternative without this ability.
</P>
<P>
   And, ever in tune with what's fashionable, all three programs
let you publish documents on an in-house network or on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are taking about here are hairline differences between
the different programs,'' says Michael Lasky, senior associate
editor at PC World. He has worked with and reviewed all three of
the suites over the years.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difference among the three programs is price. Office
2000 is the most expensive, with its minimum version costing $499.
On the other end of the scale is WordPerfect. Its most expensive
package is only $209.
</P>
<P>
   Another key difference among the three programs is in feel and
approach. Office 2000 lets you customize just about every feature
in a mind-boggling array of choices. In contrast, SmartSuite favors
a simpler interface but limits how much you can customize the
program.
</P>
<P>
   While offering identical packages of software, the suites are
not uniform in performance. WordPerfect is considered by many to
have the best word processor in terms of features and ease of use.
Office 2000 remains the leader in spreadsheets with its Excel
program.
</P>
<P>
   What follows is an analysis of each suite's strengths and
weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   Office 2000
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, Microsoft's suite is the standard by which the
other two suites are judged. That's because Office makes up 90
percent of the market for suite software.
</P>
<P>
   Office's greatest strength is its vast feature set. That is also
its greatest weakness. Many users are simply overwhelmed by the
choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a jungle in there,'' says Lasky about Office 2000's inner
workings. ``You have to navigate such a thicket of features just to
write a letter.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Office 2000 strength is something called cross platform
compatibility. That means PC and Mac users can easily open each
other's documents created in Office.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of Office remains the suite's Word word processing and
Excel spreadsheet programs, which remain largely unchanged from
earlier versions. Microsoft, however, has added several helpful
enhancements in its latest version, released earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Top of the list is something called multiple clipboards, which
lets you save up to 12 different things simultaneously. This is a
new feature for a PC program, although Mac word processor Nisus
Writer has been able to do this for years.
</P>
<P>
   Another Office 2000 innovation is smart menus. The program
observes how you work and then lists it in its pull-down menus only
those commands most used. The idea is to cut down on the clutter of
functions.
</P>
<P>
   Other Office 2000 innovations include the ability to insert text
or graphics anywhere on a page and a feature called self-repair.
The program will automatically replace key files mistakenly
deleted.
</P>
<P>
   WordPerfect 2000
</P>
<P>
   Believe or not, there was a time when WordPerfect was the
leading word processor. To this day it remains a strong program and
retains a loyal following.
</P>
<P>
   One of the features that makes WordPerfect's word processor so
strong is its use of the NaturallySpeaking voice recognition
technology. Developed by Dragon Software, NaturallySpeaking lets
WordPerfect type as you talk. You must, however, first train
NaturallySpeaking to recognize your pronunciation.
</P>
<P>
   Office 2000 doesn't yet include any voice recognition
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Another WordPerfect innovation is something called RealTime
Preview. This is a feature that lets you edit, changing text and
margins, a document in the print preview mode.
</P>
<P>
   WordPerfect will also let you drag and drop images, sound and
video clips into an electronic scrapbook.
</P>
<P>
   The software's weakest link is its spreadsheet program, Quattro
Pro. That's not to say Quattro Pro is bad. It's just not as strong
as those in SmartSuite and Office.
</P>
<P>
   SmartSuite
</P>
<P>
   SmartSuite strengths are threefold: great Web publishing and
groupware tools and exceptional integration with Lotus Notes,
SmartSuite's sister e-mail program.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of SmartSuite's Web publishing tools is a feature
called FastSite. It lets users easily and quickly convert print
documents into Web pages. For example, FastSite automatically adds
Web navigation tools to converted documents and builds a home page
and a table of contents.
</P>
<P>
   ``SmartSuite's Internet features and ease of use leaves other
suites in the dust,'' PC magazine said in a recent review of the
software.
</P>
<P>
   The second strength is a set of groupware tools. These tools let
several users worked simultaneously on the same document,
highlighting who made what changes and keeping track of them.
</P>
<P>
   Office 2000 also has groupware tools, but they're not considered
as strong as those in SmartSuite.
</P>
<P>
   SmartSuite has a good, if less feature-rich, writing program in
Word Pro. Its spreadsheet program, 1-2-3 is considered second to
Office's Excel.
</P>
<P>
   SmartSuite also has voice recognition technology, called
ViaVoice. ViaVoice is considered harder to train and less accurate
than NaturallySpeaking. But it does have one advantage over
NaturallySpeaking. ViaVoice can read back text.
</P>
<P>
   What SmartSuite lacks is the high-level of automation offered by
Office 2000. It's also hard to customize. SmartSuite's scripting
language is daunting to anyone but a professional programmer.
</P>
<P>
   So what program is best suited for you? It depends on your
needs.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to march in step with most of the corporate world
than Office 2000 is your choice. In addition, Office 2000 remains,
overall, the most powerful of the suites.
</P>
<P>
   However, if price is a big consideration, you should give
WordPerfect a close look. It delivers the most bang for the buck.
</P>
<P>
   And, if you need to publish a lot online, then SmartSuite might
be best for you.

 &HT;    DJX Keyboard makes music fun
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Yamaha DJX portable keyboard offers some of the
features of professional electronic keyboards at a price that makes
it accessible to younger customers, according to Yamaha Corp. of
America.
</P>
<P>
   The keyboard is focused on dance styles and has automatic
accompaniment capabilities for music ranging from ``Rap'' to
``Techno'' to ``Rave.'' It also offers sounds such as sampled drum
loops and human voices.
</P>
<P>
   The DJX, like most portable keyboards for the amateur market, is
designed so that even a novice can make music immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The suggested retail price for the DJX keyboard is $459.95,
which is significantly cheaper than professional model keyboards
with the same types of accompaniments and sound styles, according
to Yamaha.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yamaha DJX could well be the Nintendo of the music
industry,'' said Yamaha marketing executive Jim Presley.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Ace Music Superstore in Dayton said the
store carries the DJX but they sell out quickly whenever a shipment
comes in.
</P>
<P>
   You can get additional information about the keyboard at the
Yamaha Web site at www.yamaha.com.

 &HT;    Webby Awards seeking nominees
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Webbies are going democratic.
</P>
<P>
   This year, for the first time, people can nominate Web sites for
consideration in the March 2000 Webby Awards, the fourth time the
Web's best sites have been honored.
</P>
<P>
   The International Academy of Digital Arts &AMP; Sciences is adding
two categories this year, one for personal Web sites and one for
sites about activism. Other categories include arts, community,
commerce, education, fashion, film, finance, games, health, humor,
living, music, news, politics and law, print and e-zines
(electronic magazines), science, sports, technical achievement, TV,
travel and weird. Sites are judged on content, structure,
navigation, visual design, functionality, interactivity and overall
experience.
</P>
<P>
   To nominate a site, visit www.webbyawards.com. Entries are
accepted through Sept. 16. Entries cost $50 per Web site, per
category.
</P>
<P>
   To be eligible for the contest, dubbed the Oscars of the
Internet, your site must be live and open to traffic. Detailed
rules are listed on the Web site. Nominees will be announced in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Transparent mouse among new models
</P>
<P>
   The mouse is going see-through.
</P>
<P>
   Fellowes, an Itasca, Ill., company, is selling two new models.
One, called TechMouse, is transparent. The two-button mouse works
with Windows 98 or iMac systems and comes with a 6 1/2-inch cable
and a USB connector. The mouse, which carries a three-year
warranty, sells for about $18.
</P>
<P>
   Fellowes' GelMouse is housed in gel that conforms to your hand.
The device has three buttons that can be programmed. It works with
Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows NT and retails for about $30.
</P>
<P>
   Packard Bell NEC computer thin, stylish
</P>
<P>
   Packard Bell NEC has come out with the PC's answer to the iMac:
a more stylish version of the traditional, bulky beige computer
box.
</P>
<P>
   The Z1 uses about as much space as a sheaf of paper. The machine
is mostly monitor. It comes with a 15-inch flat-panel monitor and
keyboard. The computer has a 450-megahertz Intel Pentium III
processor, 96 megabytes of memory, an 8.4-gigabyte hard drive and a
DVD drive.
</P>
<P>
   The machines come with a 3.5-inch disk drive. They are
pre-loaded with Windows 98, Microsoft Word 97, Intuit's Quicken
Basic 98 and Microsoft Money 99.
</P>
<P>
   The Z1 sells for about $2,500. It is expected to be in stores in
early August.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento, Calif.-based Packard Bell NEC said the all-in-one
system takes up the least amount of space of any desktop computer
on the market. The machine, highlighted by a two-toned metallic
cover and arched base, is 10 inches square. The reduced size is the
result of a combination of desktop and laptop technology.
</P>
<P>
   The system is interestingly upgradeable. Users can upgrade their
hard drive using an integrated module, which will be available as
an accessory later this year. The module connects to the hard drive
in the Z1's base. Once docked, the user runs the hard disk copy
software to create a copy of the original hard drive. Once the
disks are swapped, the upgrade is complete.
</P>
<P>
   Web site provides for range of communications
</P>
<P>
   If you want the benefit of being able to communicate in as many
ways as possible but don't have the money to buy the software or
hardware, a new Web site might help.
</P>
<P>
   The site, www.MessageBlaster.com, lets someone on the Internet
contact people by e-mail, voice, pager, fax, regular mail or
next-day mail. Once the message is sent, it lets you track the
receipt of the message and receive replies.
</P>
<P>
   The feature requires no software and no contract. A customer
would need a credit card to set up an account. The price is 15
cents for a message delivered over phone lines. E-mail is free, but
the fees for regular mail and overnight delivery are marked up.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in Billerica, Mass., was founded in May 1998.

 &HT;    Whereas, you may need legal aid, and whereas ...
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A few of my best friends are lawyers. However, they
were my best friends before they became lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with lawyers, in my view, is that there are too many
of them. Lawyers have their place in the scheme of things, just as
forest fires, scorpions and sharks have.
</P>
<P>
   But the balance of nature regarding lawyers has become skewed,
leaving many of them with nothing better to do than silly things
like accusing publishers of computer legal programs of practicing
law without a license.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know what became of these lawsuits, but at least one
such program survived and flourishes; it is Quicken Family Lawyer
2000 Deluxe. At least that's what the box says. When the
installation program comes up on screen, it has become Parsons
Technology Family Lawyer 2000 Deluxe. Ah well, a rose by any other
name, etc.
</P>
<P>
   It's been years since I last looked at one of these programs.
This one, at least, still does all the same things _ a seemingly
endless number of letters _ dunning, threatening, supplicating and
placating; living wills, dead wills and various medical requests;
bills of sale and a lot of things you would never think you'd need
a lawyer to do, like letters to confirm hotel reservations.
</P>
<P>
   However, it does all these things a good deal more gracefully
than those older programs. Like the income tax programs, it begins
with an interview to determine your name and address, your marital
status and the names, addresses and status of your children. Then
it presents its entire list of possibilities, with the ones it
believes of most interest to you check-marked.
</P>
<P>
   Since I truthfully told the program I was married and not either
divorced or contemplating divorce, all the programs of special
interest to me turn out to be connected to my demise.
</P>
<P>
   I went through the process of making out a ``Will _ Parent With
Adult Children.'' Once again, this is accomplished through an
interview process. You are given the opportunity to disinherit any
or all of the offspring you listed in the beginning, and to
disinherit your spouse, for that matter, although the program warns
you can't get away with that in some states.
</P>
<P>
   Decisions have to be made on what should be done if no one can
tell who died first _ you or your spouse _ and then you get the
opportunity to bequeath certain things to certain people, ad
infinitum et nauseam.
</P>
<P>
   The basic value of this program is in helping you prepare a
will, a living will to provide instructions on whether to keep you
alive by way of machinery, and other fairly common legal documents
like powers of attorney. Many of the other papers it will produce
don't seem to have much to do with real legal documents.
</P>
<P>
   There is a brief but useful law dictionary, defining G-man and
T-man (didn't know those were legal terms, did you?) and everything
else from ab initio to yellow dog contract.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the American Bar Association Family Law Guide, but
that will cost you another 20 bucks to unlock and use.
</P>
<P>
   This is a well-executed program. As to whether you would find it
useful, or whether any of this stuff will hold up to your
disinherited children's outraged lawyer _ well, you don't expect me
to stick my neck out, do you?

 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEVIL'S LAKE, N.D. _ Jim Yri, a tall, sunburned farmer with
movie star looks and the folksy style of Jimmy Stewart, has battled
North Dakota blizzards and wheat fungus and, lately, appallingly
low crop prices. But now he is in a struggle with a lake that he is
afraid he just might lose.
</P>
<P>
   The lake, the namesake for this little town, began rising seven
years ago when it was just a sliver on the horizon beyond Yri's
white clapboard farm house west of here.
</P>
<P>
   At first, he shrugged it off as no more than the natural
consequence of especially heavy snowfall and rain. But each year
the lake has climbed higher and now the water is in his yard,
creeping toward his basement, like some incredible science-fiction
monster, threatening to drive him off the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``You plow a field and come back a week later and the water has
taken the field,'' Yri (pronounced Erie) said the other day.
</P>
<P>
   He and thousands of other people around Devil's Lake on the
rolling prairie of northeastern North Dakota are caught up in a
strange, gradual flood like nothing modern America has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   Inch by inch, the lake has been swelling across a gently sloping
basin without an outlet, forcing nearly 400 families to move their
homes as it swallowed up 80,000 acres of farmland, three state
parks, miles of country roads and perhaps a million trees. Devil's
Lake has tripled in size and now sprawls over nearly 200 square
miles, making it more than eight times the size of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike river floods that crush towns in a flash, the destruction
at Devil's Lake has come one or two houses at a time, acre by acre,
utility pole by utility pole, never with a single surge stunning
enough to make the national news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people realize the severity of what's happening
here,'' said Tom LaMotte, the owner of several businesses in
Devil's Lake, a town of 10,000 people that is still above water
because the rising lake is being held back by a man-built wall of
rock and earth.
</P>
<P>
   Devil's Lake and the Great Salt Lake in Utah are among a very
few lakes without natural drainage. Their waters rise and fall
depending on rain and snow and the saturation of surrounding lands,
scientists say, and North Dakota has been in a prolonged wet cycle.
The Great Salt Lake flooded in the mid-1980s with less damage than
is now being experienced at Devil's Lake, officials say, and while
the Salt Lake has risen over the last three years, it has caused
little harm.
</P>
<P>
   The slow-motion destruction by Devil's Lake, coupled with
gnawing uncertainty about what the lake will do next _ level off
and create a booming resort area or keep rising and destroying _
are straining the economy and people's nerves. If being forced to
leave were inevitable, many people would leave now. But no one
really wants to go. Most of them have been here all their lives.
</P>
<P>
   They like the quiet beauty of the lake, the vermilion explosions
at sunset and the serenity of communities where homes and cars are
seldom locked. A good many people recognize that if the lake ever
does settle down, their property values are likely to skyrocket
because of the resort possibilities. Still, nearly everyone would
have been happier if the lake had just remained a nice place to
visit on a Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state agencies have poured more than $300 million
into temporary measures: building dikes, keeping roads open and
moving homes out of harm's way. In early June, President Clinton
authorized spending tens of millions for more of the same. But
people are beginning to grumble that the money has been wasted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of building up the roads a little more every year,
they should be finding some permanent solution,'' said Jarvis
Haugeberg, who runs the grain elevator on a shrinking peninsula in
Church's Ferry, 20 miles to the northwest. ``But they just keep
making new studies and arguing about what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Fred Bott of Devil's Lake, along with just about everyone
else around here, argues for hacking an opening in one side of the
lake so that it can be drained to a tolerable level, into the
Sheyenne River. But environmental groups and people in several
North Dakota towns worry that any significant drainage could bring
flooding elsewhere, and that the sulfate-laden waters of Devil's
Lake could contaminate streams and the water supplies of other
communities. Canadians also oppose the drainage, as the Sheyenne
runs into the Red River, which flows into their country.
</P>
<P>
   The Army Corps of Engineers agreed in early June that an outlet
should be built. But the corps proposed waiting to release water
until Devil's Lake had risen another seven feet, something the
engineers think could take until 2006 but many residents fear could
happen much more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   North Dakota officials could hardly believe their ears when they
heard the corps' proposal. Gov. Edward T. Schafer and the state's
three members of Congress said that letting the lake rise that much
higher would inundate an additional 75,000 acres and could cost up
to $200 million more for dikes and roads.
</P>
<P>
   So the debate continues. So does the uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always eating at you,'' Yri said as he and his wife,
Diane, talked the other evening in their kitchen. ``There's a lot
of mental depression around here. You just don't feel like doing
anything. Why bother? Next week it will be under water.''
</P>
<P>
   The wind kicked up the other day, Mrs. Yri said, churning up
waves that seemed bent on wrecking the house. It was more than she
could bear and she ran screaming to her husband. ``What are they
going to do,'' she recalled demanding. ``What are they going to
do?'' Yri held her tight.
</P>
<P>
   ``They,'' Yri said, ``are not going to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   At her small, white-shingled home in the village of Minnewaukan,
at the edge of the lake, 20 miles west of here, Elizabeth Stensby,
a 72-year-old widow, says she keeps asking herself, ``Can I stay or
do I have to leave?''
</P>
<P>
   Her house, where she raised six children, was eight miles from
the lake when it started rising. Now the water is edging into her
backyard. A golf course just across the highway has gone under
water and the town has trucked in sand to make a beach. A few
blocks away, the lake is advancing on the high school football
field and the main classroom building. Allan Nord, a carpenter who
lives near the high school, is talking about opening a bait shop.

 &HT;    Choosing between a singing pig and a Pavarotti
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Imagine what it would be like if your best friend
owned a pig that could sing.
</P>
<P>
   You'd be able to invite everyone over on a Saturday night and
have the pig perform _ maybe Shubert's ``Trout.''
</P>
<P>
   At first it would really be neat. Everyone would forgive the pig
for not having a voice like Frank Sinatra or Ella Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   But pretty soon the novelty wouldn't be enough and _ when you
really wanted to hear music _ you'd turn to someone who was less of
a swine and more a singer.
</P>
<P>
   In the technology world, there are plenty of pigs that can sing.
There's a temptation to create a product just because it is
technologically possible without regard for whether the new
technology is better than the old.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes these gizmos are nifty and impressive but just aren't
as useful as the technology they attempt to replace. Enough
philosophizing _ let's listen to some pigs that sing off-key.
</P>
<P>
   _ Using your computer as an answering machine is dumb. Many PCs
come with software to let your PC's modem answer the call and then
use the PC's hard disk to record the incoming messages as voice
files. Truth is, it works. But so does a $30 answering machine _ in
fact, the cheap answering machine works better. It also doesn't
require keeping your PC on 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Several companies, including Panasonic, now make tiny DVD
players. For right under $1,000, you can watch a DVD movie on its
5.8-inch screen. But imagine, if you will, watching ``Saving
Private Ryan'' that way, or picture a basketball game played by
ants (some users report that they can't even read the title on the
little screen). To be fair, this sucker will also hook up to your
regular TV. But if that's what you want, get one of the $300 AC
models that are meant to work that way.
</P>
<P>
   _ E-books. We'll be looking at them in more detail in a later
edition of this column. Maybe you already know, these are
electronic gizmos that allow you to download the text of a book and
then view the book on the screen. You'll pay about $500 for the
most popular reader _ the Rocket eBook. Then you'll pay about $20
for each book you buy. Would you rather buy a $6 paperback you can
read in the bathtub and then lend to your buddy, or do you want to
spend $20 on an e-book and read it on a machine? Also, if you drop
the paperback or hardback, it will make a loud slapping sound and
then work just fine. If you drop the eBook, it also will make a
loud sound, and you'll be about $500 poorer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Using your computer monitor to watch TV. You can get TV cards
that let you attach an antenna or a cable connection and receive TV
signals and then watch them on your computer monitor. Now think
about it. I can either sit down in my leather reclining chair and
watch TV on my big-screen monitor, or I can sit at a desk chair and
watch TV on my PC's 17-inch monitor. Duh.
</P>
<P>
   These are my singing pigs. I'm not telling you that they'll be
your pigs. There's almost certainly someone out there with a
special circumstance just made for one of these gadgets. But you
probably aren't that person. Save your money and, instead, get a
good CD recording of Ella or Frank.

DEVIL'S LAKE, N.D.: bait shop.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since 1993, Devil's Lake has risen nearly 25 feet, to a level
higher than it has been in more than 100 years, scientists said.
The wall of clay and rocks holding it back from the town, built
mainly in the last three years, is seven miles long. Without the
wall, most of the town's small, brown-brick business district and
its wide, tree-shaded streets and modest homes would be roof-deep
in water, said state Sen. Vern Thompson. Yet for many people, the
dike is as unnerving as it is protective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like anything that was constructed as quickly as the dike, you
wonder, `Is it really secure?''' said Paul Keating, the owner of
the local Radio Shack franchise. ``It's holding back 30 miles of
water, 25 feet deep. The big dams and reservoirs are concrete. This
is just dirt. If we get a major thunder storm, how much lightening
can it take? What would a tornado do to it? You read about the
bombing in Oklahoma and the high school shooting in Colorado.
What's to stop somebody from sabotaging the dike?''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross has been giving classes in what to do in a flood
emergency. Its evacuation plan links everyone's address to the
nearest landmark to help rescue teams find them.
</P>
<P>
   Tammy Rutten, who manages a water-tower painting business with
her husband, Tim, says she always drives with her windows rolled
down so that she can ``bail out'' in case her car goes into the
water. A bank receptionist says she has taken no special
precautions, but she knows that if the dike breaks, she has three
minutes to get out of her house. Mrs. Yri has enrolled her children
in swimming classes.
</P>
<P>
   Keating, at Radio Shack, like many small-business men in Devil's
Lake, is barely surviving. For some merchants, sales are down at
least 25 percent this year. Investors are holding back on starting
new projects.
</P>
<P>
   For people as far as 50 miles away, going shopping in Devil's
Lake used to mean a fairly pleasant drive through fields of wheat
and barley and sunflowers. Now those roads that have not
disappeared entirely have become scary causeways with waves chewing
at their edges. Heavy trucks loaded with rock and clay thunder
along from dawn to dusk and construction detours often turn a
20-minute trip into an ordeal of an hour or more.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is suffering. Contractors working on the dikes
and roads and moving endangered houses are doing very well. They,
in turn, are making the cash registers ring for other businesses,
with their workers buying fuel, staying in motels and recreational
vehicle parks and eating in local restaurants. Fishing and duck
hunting have never been better. So tourism is up. Rooms that often
languished at the Woodland Resort are now booked solid. One farmer
has converted his flooded land into a fishing camp and the Sioux
Indians at the Spirit Lake Nation reservation, on the southern
shore, are building a nearly 200-slip marina just behind their
gambling casino.
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   No one here wants to seem ungrateful for the government help
they have received, but many people say they cannot help thinking
that if Devil's Lake was not such a small community, if it was not
in the middle of nowhere and if it could muster a bit more
political clout, the lake problem would have been solved by now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bus being hit by a train doesn't have enough passengers,''
said Rick LaFleur, who runs a family business that distributes
jukeboxes and pinball machines.
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Yri has begun to wonder whether he can keep working the land the
way his father did before him. He has sold off the last of his 50
beef cattle because the water has taken their grazing land and he
is talking about moving his house to higher ground. But he worries
that the water will take the main roads and put him out of
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the roads, we're an island,'' he said. ``People felt
the lake couldn't keep rising, but it just keeps coming.''

TEXAS WOMAN SEEKS PROOF SHE'S RELATED TO JESSE JAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 JERRY BERRIOS  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) _ Betty Dorsett Duke was 7 when she was first told
that paternal great-grandfather James L. Courtney was the legendary
outlaw Jesse James.
</P>
<P>
   Duke, now 52, wants to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   A Texas court is scheduled to decide this month whether Duke
will be allowed to have Courtney's remains exhumed so his DNA can
be compared with a known descendent of Zerelda James Samuel, Jesse
James' mother.
</P>
<P>
   Duke, who lives in Liberty Hill, Texas, started her mission in
1996 after she found a family photograph that showed her
great-great-grandmother was missing her right arm. Zerelda James
Samuel did not have a right arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would really, really shock me if I'm wrong,'' Duke said in
a recent telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   However, many of Duke's relatives think she is wrong and are
opposing the exhumation of Courtney's remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never in my life heard such a false thing,'' said H.C.
Shelton, 84, Courtney's grandson. He lives in Junction City, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton says numbers and dates prove his grandfather was not
James.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said Courtney was more than 6 feet tall and
weighed more than 200 pounds. Shelton said that according to one
James historian, Phillip Steele, James was 5 feet 9 inches tall and
weighed 150 pounds or less.
</P>
<P>
   Duke says descriptions of James vary.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton also said Courtney enlisted in the Union Army in
Warrensburg, Mo., in 1864 with his father's signature, Stephen
Courtney _ not with the name of Robert James, Jesse's father.
Shelton said he had documents, including James Courtney's original
Civil War discharge, as proof.
</P>
<P>
   Duke says she thinks her great-grandfather faked his Civil War
involvement as part of his cover.
</P>
<P>
   In court documents, Shelton submitted dates of James' robberies
and entries from his grandfather's diary. For example, on April 29,
1872, according to Shelton's letter, James was in Columbia, Ky.,
and Shelton's grandfather was in Falls County, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you have to do is check the dates,'' Shelton said.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse James was born in Kearney, Mo., in 1847. He is said to
have died April 3, 1882, after being shot in the back of the head
by fellow gang member Bob Ford in St. Joseph, Mo. James was 34.
</P>
<P>
   Duke said her great-grandfather came to Texas about 11 years
before faking his death. He assumed the Courtney name and married
Mary Ellen Barron. Duke said her great-grandfather died in 1943 at
the age of 96. He is buried in Blevins (Texas) Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Duke says a forensic expert at the Austin Police Department has
said Duke's photographs of Courtney closely match known photographs
of James.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton says the photograph Duke uses is not Courtney, but
Courtney's brother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton says that he knew his grandfather and that he has never
heard Courtney was James.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I know, no other branch of the Courtney family
believes her story,'' Shelton said about Duke.
</P>
<P>
   James E. Starrs doesn't believe Duke, either.
</P>
<P>
   Starrs, a forensics and law professor at George Washington
University, led the exhumation of remains from James' grave at
Mount Olivet Cemetery in Kearney in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 110 percent certain that it's Jesse James,'' Starrs said
from his office in Washington. ``There is no doubt that it is Jesse
James.''
</P>
<P>
   Betty Barr, who was confirmed as James' great-granddaughter
through the 1995 exhumation, isn't bothered by Duke's claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has the right to do that,'' Barr said from her Overland
Park home. ``It's a free world.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr says there has never been any doubt of her family's
heritage.
</P>
<P>
   But Duke is adamant that Courtney was James.
</P>
<P>
   She remembers a car trip in her childhood when her father spun
stories of Courtney riding into a Texas town with saddlebags filled
with gold. Her father also talked about Courtney riding with the
Younger gang and being skilled with a gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just chalked it up to a tall, Texas tale,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then she found the photographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``History needs to be corrected,'' Duke said.

   Three weeks ago, Joseph Nacchio was Wall Street's version of
Rodney Dangerfield: He couldn't get respect.
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive of telecommunications upstart Qwest
Communications International had just begun not one, but two
unsolicited offers for companies that had recently agreed to merge
with rival Global Crossing. Investors balked, and Nacchio's $55
billion gamble _ along with Qwest's stock price _ landed with a
thud. As a Wall Street banker remarked at the time, ``This will be
a Harvard Business School case study someday on how not to launch a
hostile takeover.''
</P>
<P>
   What a difference a few weeks makes. Over the weekend, while
other Americans grilled burgers in their back yards, Qwest
executives, including Nacchio, gathered in Denver and New York to
begin preliminary and separate merger discussions with executives
from both Frontier Corp., the fifth-largest long-distance telephone
company, and U S West, the smallest of the regional Bell companies.
</P>
<P>
   To many bankers and analysts, such talks were unthinkable; that
was until Qwest sweetened its offer and Global Crossing's stock
price began to slide last week. Frontier and U S West, fearing
investor lawsuits or offending either company, have tiptoed around
picking sides, despite the verbal jousting of their suitors. It is
up to Qwest now to persuade U S West and Frontier that its offer is
better than Global Crossing's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like this,'' said one executive close
to the talks. ``Everyone is on pins and needles.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not surprising, given what is at stake: Both Qwest and
Global Crossing are trying to catapult themselves into the ranks of
the communications elite that can successfully navigate the
perilous transformation of old-world cable and copper wires into
the new digital universe of the Internet. For the men who founded
these promising upstarts _ and the executives they have hired to
run them _ it is a costly experiment, one they are betting
reputations and fortunes on. And if recent events are a taste of
the deal politicking to come, the most interesting days are ahead
for all.
</P>
<P>
   Nacchio has assembled his team of bankers, lawyers and media
advisers on the 15th floor of Qwest's headquarters in downtown
Denver, where executives not dispatched elsewhere gather at a
U-shaped table for morning and afternoon briefings. There, people
on 24-hour alert respond to any crisis that could weaken Qwest's
case, including dashing off letters to U S West executives
responding to news accounts that Qwest believes are misleading. As
many as 30 investment advisers from Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette
are split into two groups: one to meet with advisers for U S West
in Denver, the other to meet with Frontier negotiators in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Because Global Crossing, which is based in Bermuda, has already
signed merger agreements with U S West and Frontier, there has been
little to do. Global Crossing has a provision which allows it to
get a ``last look'' at any terms offered by Qwest. But Global
executives are far from passive. Robert Annunziata, Global's chief
executive, plans to take his company's case directly to investors
this week _ much as Qwest has done _ after the company files
documents with regulators Tuesday regarding its merger with
Frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of a personal rivalry between Annunziata and
Nacchio. Both are scrappy fighters, honing their street smarts in
the neighborhoods in and around New York City. Annunziata, a
17-year veteran of AT&AMP;T raised on Long Island, N.Y., founded
Teleport Communications Group, which was the nation's largest
competitive local phone carrier before it was sold to AT&AMP;T last
year for $12 billion. Nacchio is the hypercompetitive, sometimes
cocky consumer products strategist who grew up on Staten Island in
New York City and spent 27 years at AT&AMP;T, ascending to the No. 3
spot.
</P>
<P>
   But people who know both men say that their zeal for U S West
and Frontier is rooted in their personal quests to build the AT&AMP;T
for the new millenium, not in any desire to spar. Annunziata has
turned down requests for interviews, citing regulatory rules which
bar him from speaking.
</P>
<P>
   But Nacchio not only agrees with this notion, he embraces it.
``AT&AMP;T was a great company for the 20th century,'' Nacchio said.
``But Qwest will replace it in the 21st century.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Being at the vortex of a communications shift is what the
largest investors of both Qwest and Global Crossing hope they have
seized upon, too. One couldn't have found a more unlikely
telecommunications baron than Gary Winnick, Global Crossing's
founder. He has no industry experience to speak of, having first
made his name as an associate of junk-bond king Michael Milken in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   His track record as a financier is mixed: A furniture chain and
a mattress company he bought in the late 1980s both declared
bankruptcy within weeks of each other in 1991. But Winnick had a
winning way with Global Crossing, turning an initial $15 million
investment into about $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   His manner is, at times, unorthodox. He routinely conducts
late-night business meetings with top executives while exercising
on his office treadmill. People who have worked with him say he
acts as if he's still on a trading desk, standing at his desk
yelling orders into the phone. And when asked recently about how he
planned to manage the egos of the many former chief executives he
had on staff, the billionaire said with a laugh, ``I'll give them
all 2-by-4s and let them work it out.''
</P>
<P>
   There is much to suggest that he is the one calling the shots.
Annunziata, for one, was hired only in February. And it was Winnick
who personally gave his blessing to U S West to begin talks with
Qwest, said people close to the talks. It was a deft move; U S West
now can hold talks without alienating Annunziata or putting U S
West's board in the awkward position of declaring Qwest's bid
better.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Anschutz, the reclusive Denver billionaire who owns 40
percent of Qwest, is a formidable foil to Winnick. He too is a
financier, but made his money in oil and railroads, in particular,
purchasing Southern Pacific Railroad in the late 1980s for $1.8
billion and then selling it to Union Pacific in 1996 for $5.4
billion. Qwest grew out of that investment. He paid Southern
Pacific for the right-of-way to lay fiber-optic cable along
railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Like Winnick, he is driven to find opportunity where there seems
to be none. In 1968, for instance, when an oil well he was drilling
for Chevron Corp. ignited, Anschutz persuaded Universal Studios to
pay him $100,000 for the rights to film the burning well for an
upcoming movie starring John Wayne. With that money, according to
news reports, he paid firefighters to stop the fire and saved the
well.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins U S West and Frontier will come down to which man
wants them most and the price he is willing to pay. Winnick, said
people close to the talks, insists he will walk away if the price
gets too high in a bidding war. But the question industry analysts
are asking themselves is, `Walk away to what?' Most agree that
Global Crossing needs Frontier more than Qwest does.
</P>
<P>
   Any compromise, if one exists, might have to be worked out
personally between Anschutz and Winnick, Wall Street analysts said.
But Robert Gensler, a telecommunications analyst for T. Rowe Price,
may have heard the most telling comment about what Global Crossing
can expect from Qwest in the coming weeks. ``If I can't win this
thing,'' Gensler said Nacchio told him recently, ''it's going to be
painful for others.''

GORE OPENLY WOOING WOMEN VOTERS, WHO SEEM TO PREFER BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Fla., Tenn., Texas)   (Eds: Words in bold can be italic.)  
(nk) 
 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The first thing Al Gore mentioned in every speech
last week was that his oldest daughter was past her due date and
about to make him and his wife of 29 years grandparents. (Wyatt
Gore Schiff, 6 pounds 3 ounces, finally arrived on the Fourth of
July, a fact sure to become a bragging point in future speeches.)
</P>
<P>
   The second thing he told crowds was that he had been reared by a
mother who grew up poor, got on a bus to Nashville with her blind
sister in tow, waited tables for quarter tips and, in 1936, became
one of the first women to graduate from Vanderbilt Law School.
</P>
<P>
   When he listened as a child to the daily back and forth between
his parents, ``it was clear to me that men and women were equal _
if not more so,'' Gore said to great effect, drawing whoops from
his listeners at every stop.
</P>
<P>
   In his run for the White House, the vice president is
aggressively pursuing female voters _ that increasingly important
bloc that so far seems to favor Texas Gov. George W. Bush slightly
_ and the pitch is not terribly subtle.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever possible, Gore is introduced to his audiences by a
woman. (Christine Meyer, the mother of a 3-year-old cancer
survivor, did the honors before his Philadelphia speech supporting
cancer research last week. ``I said my husband is really the
speaker,'' Ms. Meyer said in an interview, ``but they said no, we
want you to do it. They wanted a mom's perspective.'')
</P>
<P>
   The vice president steps onstage to the tune of ``Rock This
Country,'' a country song by a female vocalist, Shania Twain. A
campaign video focuses primarily on him as husband and father, with
his daughter Karenna Schiff repeatedly assuring viewers that her
dad is  &UR; so funny. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Then comes his standard stump speech, chock full of talk about
day care, early-childhood education and gender equality. ``This
pledge,'' he says, ``is in honor of my mother: An equal day's pay
for an equal day's work.'' He promises also to ``fight for the
ability to balance work and family'' and ``to shield our children
from gun violence.'' And his biggest applause line is usually his
vow to ``make sure we have high-quality preschool available for
every child.''
</P>
<P>
   This wildly woman-friendly agenda is not a poll-tested new focus
for the vice president. Gore has worked on these issues throughout
his public life, co-sponsoring early versions of the Family and
Medical Leave Act in the Senate and a series of bills on women's
health in the House as far back as the early 1980s. He opposed
federal financing of abortion early in his House career, but has
been a supporter of abortion rights for many years and was a Senate
co-sponsor of a bill that would have made a federal statute of Roe
vs. Wade. He has surrounded himself with accomplished women who
have become some of his closest aides, and is considered by his
staff to be an unusually family-friendly employer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his campaign  &UR; is  &LR; without question reacting to polls
suggesting that at least at this early date, American women, who
have heavily favored Democrats in recent elections, seem to prefer
Bush, an opponent of abortion. David Beckwith, a Bush spokesman,
said the governor's ``compassionate conservatism'' appealed to
everybody. Even when Bush ran for governor in 1994 against a female
incumbent, Ann Richards, there was virtually no gender gap,
Beckwith noted: 49 percent of Texas women who went to the polls,
like 53 percent of the men, supported Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Though women favored Bill Clinton over Bob Dole by 16 percentage
points in 1996, one recent CNN poll had them backing Bush over Gore
by 11 points. (The vice president was farther behind among men, by
21 points.)
</P>
<P>
   Political consultants from both parties see the Gore numbers at
least in part as evidence of displaced anger over the president's
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear Gore is carrying some Clinton baggage,'' said one
Republican consultant, Susan Molinari, a former congresswoman from
New York. ``For whatever reason, Clinton just has the energy to
deflect that stuff, and Gore doesn't. People seem to resent Gore
more for Clinton's actions. It's like two brothers, and the good
one the mom says: `You should know better. You should have stopped
him.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Even Gore's new pollster, Celinda Lake, who coined the term
``waitress moms'' to describe the blue-collar women who could have
the power to decide elections, agrees that the Lewinsky scandal
appears to be suppressing the vice president's numbers with women.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a delayed reaction to the Clinton factor that's
unfair to Gore,'' said Ms. Lake, who specializes in tracking female
voters and was brought on last week to help the campaign figure
them out. ``But to women, the personal is political. As they get to
know him, they'll see he's quite un-Clintonesque in that regard.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, the vice president expressed surprise that
anyone could think he might somehow wind up taking the fall for the
Lewinsky scandal. ``I don't buy it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly his campaign is working hard to make sure that does
not happen, recruiting women to fill the seats at his events, to
come and hear his direct appeals. ``Working to close that gap,''
Ms. Lake said, ``is one of the most important tasks of the
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After receiving from the headquarters of Gore's Pennsylvania
campaign ``three begging phone calls indicating they need women,''
Maureen Kelly, a Pittsburgh lawyer, agreed to attend a fund-raising
luncheon last week, at a discounted rate. Patricia McGrail, another
lawyer, attended with her and also got a discount, paying $300, she
said, for the $1,000 ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kelly, who said the campaign had asked her for the names of
other women who might be interested in hearing Gore speak,
responded positively to his remarks, and said: ``I feel bad for
him. People are going to associate him with Clinton, when in fact
he embodies the values most women want to see.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In private, Gore talks about the important women in his life
with a respect that does suggest, as several women who heard him
speak last week said, that ``he gets it.'' As he chatted on Air
Force Two, in a conversation that was initially off the record, the
vice president's mind was on his pregnant daughter. Would he cancel
his schedule when she went into labor?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he said. ``You want to run to the hospital and
be right there with her, but then again. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Got to give her her space,'' he said, laughing at himself.
``Her mother has perfect pitch on this stuff, so I guess I'll just
follow her lead.''
</P>
<P>
   (Gore also disclosed that while environmentalists are split over
Pampers vis-a-vis cloth diapers, he favors the easy way out.
``That's not a hard call,'' he joked. ``Global warming is hard.
Pampers are easy.'')
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Most of the women attending Gore campaign events at this point
are active Democrats, of course. But during three days of almost
nonstop campaign events last week, a number of women said,
essentially, that they felt he was pandering, yes, and maybe even
desperate _ yet also totally sincere.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While commentators have primarily looked at the ways in which
Gore is not enough like Clinton as a campaigner, his audiences
seemed to be focusing more on what the vice president said than how
he said it. They liked the story about his mother, and they loved
the line ``I'm running to make America not just better off, but
better.''
</P>
<P>
   At a reception in Philadelphia, one supporter, Lynne Gold-Bikin,
said she had been appalled by the poll numbers showing women
favoring Bush _ ``that  &UR; Texan &LR; ,'' &UR;  &LR; as she called him.
</P>
<P>
   ``How any woman,'' she said, ``could prefer the governor of the
state that pushes Tom DeLay and Dick Armey, who are so anti-woman I
can't even think about it, over this man who is pro-choice and has
this wonderful, exciting wife? I don't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, at yet another fund-raising luncheon, Mayor Alex
Penelas announced to Gore: ``The real person who should be
introducing you is my wife. If you say you're not voting for Al
Gore, she'll punch you in the nose. And she's the Republican in the
family.''
</P>
<P>
   When she did come to the microphone, Mrs. Penelas was as
believable as she was enthusiastic: ``Most people I tell them my
father was Basque, they say, `What is that?' '' When she told Gore,
however, ``he told me all about their customs, he gave me an
education on the Basque people _ now I say, that's knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore took it from there, and started in with how excited he was
about becoming an  &UR; abuelo  &LR; _ a grandfather _ racing through this
one Spanish word as if someone had told him the key to fluency was
talking fast.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Elsa Lopez, a single mother among his listeners, said
she felt he had been talking to her. ``We need quality day care,
not some ranch to farm these kids out on. Education, and choice _
my daughter just turned 4, but I  &UR; decided  &LR; to have her _ these
things are all key,'' said Ms. Lopez, a former Republican who now
works for the teachers' union and said she was thrilled to have
received a free ticket to the $1,000 event.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Not all women were wowed, of course, by the vice president's
focus on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept bringing up women's issues,'' said Ms. McGrail, the
Pittsburgh lawyer, who is a Democrat and the mother of three.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like he was dealing with soft issues,'' she said. ``I'm
44 years old; I'm too old for that. I wanted to hear about
something more relevant to my life, like economic development.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the presentation she heard seems to have convinced Ms.
McGrail that Gore is probably too sensitive to lead the country,
and at this point she is thinking of supporting Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not because she's a woman,'' Ms. McGrail said, ``but because I
think she'd be a strong leader. She's tough.''

FINE-ARTS ACADEMIES ATTRACT CREATIVE MINDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 MARA ROSE WILLIAMS  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLUE SPRINGS, Mo. _ Mary Ogelsby is more motivated this summer
in a drama class at the Blue Springs Fine Arts Academy than during
the school year in any academic class.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love music, and I love theater,'' said Mary, a Blue Springs
High School sophomore who wants to be a drama instructor. ``If I
didn't have a chance to do music or theater, I just don't think I
would do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of students in Missouri, Kansas and across the country
share Mary's need for artistic expression. Some say they might drop
out if not for the arts programs.
</P>
<P>
   Those students are riding a national wave of encouragement that
has spurred the growth of programs like the Blue Springs Academy.
Also fueling the movement, recent brain research shows that some
children learn in ways other than the traditional three R's.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri, fine-arts academies for middle and high school
students have sprouted in the past four years in Springfield,
Independence and Blue Springs. In the Kansas City district, magnet
programs for the arts are highly popular.
</P>
<P>
   Educators in Kansas said more money is going to train teachers
to expand music, theater and visual-arts programs by using existing
art in the community. And teachers are being taught to blend the
arts into core subjects such as English, science, history and math.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at meeting the needs of all students, the
academically proficient and the artistically gifted,'' said Dee
Hansen, fine-arts specialist at the Kansas Department of Education.
``The more we learn about how we learn, the more it validates fine
arts as an integral part of the curriculum.''
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri, arts academies are funded like other summer
programs _ through state reimbursement for attendance. Also,
philanthropic foundations contribute toward field trips and
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Springs Academy, in its first year, receives support
from the Truman Heartland Community Foundation and offers theater,
visual arts, vocal instruction, videography and creative writing.
</P>
<P>
   About 55 students attend the academy, which was modeled after
the nationally recognized George Caleb Bingham Fine Arts Academy in
the Independence district.
</P>
<P>
   The Bingham Academy, in its third year, offers a five-week
program for five disciplines: creative writing, dance, instrumental
and vocal music, theater and visual arts. Students can get one-half
credit for high school and three hours of credit through Blue River
Community College.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new experience for me, and I really love it,'' said
Kiley Smith, a Truman High School junior studying visual arts.
</P>
<P>
   Sprawled on the classroom floor, Kiley worked on a drawing of a
mysterious-looking woman wearing a black midriff that showed her
navel through a sheer black shawl.
</P>
<P>
   Kiley said the academy offers more freedom than art classes
during the school year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students here work at their level, and they get to do their
own thing,'' explained Tom Creamer, Bingham's instructor. ``They
don't have to follow a structured classroom curriculum.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, students from the Blue Springs and Bingham
academies visit local museums, galleries and theaters. This year
the Bingham students also will spend a week studying the cultural
arts in Santa Fe, N.M. Both academies are free.
</P>
<P>
   Like the 4-year-old state Fine Arts Academy in Springfield, the
Bingham Academy selects students based on portfolios and auditions.
This year, 80 students attend. They spend four hours a day in
class, Monday through Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The local focus on arts responds to a national objective
announced by first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton in 1998 to put
high-quality arts education in all schools.
</P>
<P>
   Though no federal law mandates the teaching of fine arts, in
1994 an objective of improving fine-arts instruction was added to
the U.S. Department of Education's Goals for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   That ``confirmed the nation's commitment to having students
educated in the arts and made grant money available to develop art
programs and to train teachers,'' said Melinda Malico, a
spokeswoman with the department.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, a sampling of 6,600 eighth-grade students from across
the country was tested for knowledge of the arts. That assessment,
said Education Secretary Richard Riley, indicated that the nation
was falling short in artistic instruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arts education is an essential part of strengthening academic
achievement, creating strong schools and building a culture of
learning,'' Riley said.

SCOUTS REACH OUT TO INNER-CITY KIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 ERICA WOOD  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ At 14, Roman Lee had a choice: He could go
the way of his four older brothers and quit the Boy Scouts, or he
could follow his mother's wishes and stick with it.
</P>
<P>
   He stayed and he's glad. Of the five brothers, he was the only
one to attain the rank of Eagle Scout and graduate from college.
</P>
<P>
   He says the only difference between him and his brothers, who
have struggled with severe problems, is that he stayed in Boy
Scouts and they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom looked for an outlet to provide positive male role
models,'' Lee said of his single mother. ``The different activities
provided something to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Pioneer Trails District executive for the Kansas City
area Scouts, Lee has become the role model. He is passing on
lessons he learned as one of Kansas City's first urban Boy Scouts
of America, a branch created in 1988 to address the lack of
leadership and money in inner-city troops.
</P>
<P>
   The program, Scoutreach, was designed to draw more inner-city
children. By many accounts, it has succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Marks, finance and marketing director for Boy Scouts of
America Heart of America Council, says the number of urban Scouts
in the Kansas City area has grown from 328 in 1988 to 9,092 at the
end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Inner-city parents are hard to attract because many work several
jobs or lack transportation. So the organization hires some of them
as paid paraprofessionals who are responsible for eight troops. In
a typical Boy Scout program, a volunteer leader oversees one troop.
</P>
<P>
   Some boys receive financial aid to buy uniforms and go camping.
</P>
<P>
   Lee says he has seen boys' grades and behavior improve once they
get involved in Scouting. They learn leadership and gain
self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Moten, a fourth-grader, said that in Cub Scouts the
leaders talked about drugs and what to do if someone offers them to
you.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, the Scouts do fun things.
</P>
<P>
   Seven-year-old Quinn Hernandez said he got involved because of
camping trips. ``I knew we would have a whole lot of adventures,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Allen, Pack 27 cubmaster and assistant scoutmaster for
Troops 608 and 34, says an inner-city Scouting program provides a
vital service.
</P>
<P>
   Parents such as Tmeda Pollard say Allen has become the positive
male role model that was missing in her son's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he'll stick with it,'' Pollard said. ``He looks up to
his leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   The Scouts understand that inner-city kids face many problems,
said Alex Zaragoza, Kaw District executive for the Kansas City,
Kan., area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the mentality that if we don't do something about it, the
streets will take them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lee stresses that urban Scouts do the same things as other
Scouts. They camp, swim, earn Merit Badges and learn the Boy Scout
oath.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Cub Scouts recently came together during two
weeklong day camps.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hernandez of Kansas City, Kan., came to Cub World in
Bonner Springs with her two sons, Quinn and Anthony. She said
Scouting had taught them responsibility and kept them out of
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps with the transition into being a young man,'' she
said. ``He (Anthony) came back (from an overnight camp) a whole
different kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Hernandez, a seventh-grader, said Scouting got him out
of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like knowing what you're doing while outdoors and learning
how to handle people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Boys who camped out in Swope Park were equally excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun, and you get to do a lot of stuff,'' said 10-year-old
Dannen Powell of Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Craig, senior Kaw District executive, said adults often told
him Scouting had made their children happier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's making a difference in the child's life with them being
more positive, being able to travel to places they normally
wouldn't, being able to meet other people that are different from
them.''

 &HT;    Smoltz planning second trip to DL
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The long look on John Smoltz's face after his 7-6 loss
to the New York Mets on Sunday was a look into his future. After a
visit with team orthopedist Joe Chandler during Monday night's
game, Smoltz was expected to return to the disabled list with a
sore elbow for the second time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz has made seven starts since he went on the DL in May.
He's been effective in all but two of them, but his elbow won't let
him do any more right now despite his effort to pitch through the
pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did what I had to do the last five starts. Now we have to
take a different option,'' Smoltz said before Monday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz said he's been targeting the All-Star break as a chance
to rest his elbow again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last time I didn't think I needed as much time,'' he said.
``This time I realize I need to rest. . . . I'd like to come back
this time a little more complete.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, though, there's no indication a set amount of time
will help.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the frustrating part,'' Smoltz said. ``I could sit out
two months and have the same thing happen all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   In his absence, the Braves likely will turn again to Bruce Chen,
who's 6-3 with a 3.77 ERA in AAA Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez waits
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Javy Lopez will not come off the 15-day disabled list
today, the first day he's eligible to return to action, because his
sprained right knee is still too sore for him to catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling good,'' Lopez said. ``I can do everything, but I
can't squat right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez hit Monday for the first time since he injured his knee
attempting to steal a base in Arizona on June 20. He plans to try
to catch today, wearing a knee brace under his shin guard. He has
been wearing a knee-saver pad behind his left knee, which he had
surgery on after the 1997 season, and will now wear one on his
right knee, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all a matter of how I feel with the brace on and how I
feel with the knee saver,'' Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Cox doesn't plan to rush him back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Javy might not play until after the All-Star break,'' Cox
said. ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Grip change
</P>
<P>
   A little tinkering with Bret Boone's grip on the bat and a
couple home runs might finally have him on the right track. Boone
ended his homer drought of 169 at-bats with a pair of home runs off
Orel Hershiser on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through a tough situation the last month,'' said Boone,
who was .178 during June with only four RBIs. ``Hopefully that was
a sign I'm coming around. . . . A lot of that starts off as a
little physical thing, then mentally it gets frustrating and you
try to do a little more than you should. Next thing you know,
you're in a slump.''
</P>
<P>
   Boone said he returned to a grip that allows him ``to create a
shorter path to the ball,'' something he used last year but got
away from.
</P>
<P>
   All-star snub?
</P>
<P>
   When the starting position players for the National League
All-Star team are announced today, the Braves won't have a starter
among them for the first time since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Jordan, Chipper Jones and Kevin Millwood are all
possibilities to be invited by manager Bruce Bochy as reserves.
Those will be announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a popularity contest for starters,'' said Tom Glavine,
who started back-to-back All-Star games in 1991 and 1992. ``But
most of the guys who are starters (this year) are probably
deserving. The only one that I question is Craig Biggio. He's had a
good year, but Jay Bell has had a phenomenal year. It's still a
popularity contest. That hurts a lot of guys who have to be picked
and won't be and deserve to be there. But it's the fans' game. They
ought to see who they want to see.''

FUTURE STARS WILL MEET AT FENWAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS COCOLES  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Baseball's biggest names will converge on Boston's
Fenway Park next week for the midsummer classic.
</P>
<P>
   But we're not necessarily talking about Griffey!off, Maddux or
Piazza!off. Instead, some of the names to watch are Berkman, Penny
and Pickering.
</P>
<P>
   Household names? Not today. But the concept behind the inaugural
All-Star Futures Game on Sunday is to give baseball fans a glimpse
of tomorrow's superstars.
</P>
<P>
   Aa a tuneup to next Tuesday's Major-League All-Star Game, The
Futures Game will showcase the top prospects from every
organization. The participants will be divided into teams of
American-born players and a World squad representing 15 countries,
including Taiwan, the Netherlands and Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   The players were not selected solely on statistics, which is
often the case in all-star games. They were chosen more for their
major-league potential.
</P>
<P>
   Take pitchers Ryan Anderson (Seattle Mariners) and Mark Mulder
(Oakland A's). Anderson has been hit hard in Double-A (5-9, with a
4.87 ERA), and Mulder is a very ordinary 4-5 at Triple-A Vancouver.
But the young left-handers are projected as major-league
superstars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is always about `tomorrow' and the Futures Game will
showcase baseball's tomorrow,'' said National Association of
Professional Baseball Leagues president Mike Moore. ``We are
excited about this opportunity for the fans to see present and
future major-league all-stars in the same city.''
</P>
<P>
   The 25-man rosters include Triple-A players on the verge of
getting their major-league assignments, such as Cal State
Northridge product Adam Kennedy (St. Louis Cardinals).
</P>
<P>
   Several teen-agers who dominate the low minors will participate.
Shortstop Rafael Furcal (Atlanta Braves), 18, of Single-A Macon
(Ga.), has stolen 68 bases in 80 South Atlantic League games.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Rick Ankiel (Cardinals), 19, is considered the minors'
top prospect and has joined Kennedy at Triple-A Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   JetHawks pitcher and World all-star Chris Mears (Seattle
Mariners), a 21-year-old Canadian, admits this is a priceless
opportunity to take the mound at Fenway Park and pitch to the best
young hitters in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice honor to be selected. Hopefully there's much more
to come for me,'' said Mears, who is 19-5 the past year-and-a-half,
primarily at low Single-A. ``There's still a lot of work to be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball wants fans to see the matchups. ESPN2 will
broadcast the Futures Game by tape delay at 5 p.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game presents a tremendous opportunity for these
exceptionally skilled players to showcase their skills in a
national setting,'' said Jimmie Lee Solomon, executive director of
minor-league operations for Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Add Futures: The 30 major-league organizations had at least one
propsect chosen for the game. Both the Dodgers and Angels have two
represenatives who will play for the World Team.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' participants are Double-A San Antonio pitcher Luke
Prokopec (Australia) and Single-A San Bernardino left fielder
Chin-Feng Chen (Taiwan).
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' players are Double-A Erie pitcher Ramon Ortiz
(Dominican Republic) and shortstop E.J. t'Hoen (Netherlands).
</P>
<P>
   Grade A's: The Oakland A's are marketing their youth movement in
every way possible, and that suits Oakland's first-round pick Barry
Zito just fine. The USC and Pierce College product was the
eighth-overall selection in last month's draft and made his
professional debut Thursday for Single-A Visalia.
</P>
<P>
   The A's are depending on their farm system to turn around around
the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a young team as a whole in the organization,'' Zito said.
``I'm very excited about the A's ... It's a team that's going to be
very strong in a couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Check swings: Eric Munson (USC) was off to a respectable start
with the West Michigan Whitecaps of the Midwest League. The third
overall pick of the Detroit Tigers, Munson was hitting .243 and
making an impact defensively. In his first professional start at
catcher, Munson helped teammate Adam Bernero toss a one-hitter over
Lansing. ``I give Eric a lot of credit. He's not used to me, yet he
did a great job back there,'' Bernero said. ``He handled my pitches
well.''... The batting leaders in the independent Northern League
included several players with local ties. Madison's Chris Vasquez
(College of the Canyons) was second at .369. Sioux City's Chad
Thornhill (CSUN) was fifth at .354, and Bryan Warner (Glendale
College) was eighth at .349. Ex-Dodgers Billy Ashley (.352 for St.
Paul) and 39-year-old Mike Marshall (league-leading .375 for
Schaumburg) are among the Northern League's Top 10.

THE GROWING POPULARITY OF BRINGING DOGS TO WORK

 By LISA W. FODERARO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In most respects, Kratz &AMP; Jensen is a sleek,
efficient Manhattan public relations firm, with white ceiling fans,
brushed aluminum accents and ample windows overlooking the Flatiron
district. Look closely, however, and something altogether
unexpected flashes by. Was that a tail?
</P>
<P>
   Every Friday, the company allows staff members to bring their
dogs to the office, and a dozen of the 50 employees arrive with a
briefcase in one hand and a leash in the other. David Kratz, the
founder, got the idea after he started bringing Derby, his standard
poodle, to the office a couple of days a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it, so I think it's only fair that others can bring
their dogs in, too,'' he said. ``Dogs are the perfect company men.
They like to be with the group. They're pack animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was only a matter of time before the dog's snout
pushed its way into the corporate tent. The national observance
last month of the first Take Your Dog to Work Day, sponsored by Pet
Sitters International, a membership group in King, N.C., suggests
office dogs are on the rise. After all, many offices these days are
as formal as backyard barbecues, and Americans, who are known for
anthropomorphizing their pets, are cosseting and training their
dogs as never before.
</P>
<P>
   Employees say they bring their dogs to work because they hate to
leave them home alone, and they are more than willing to sacrifice
coffee breaks for trips to the fire hydrant. Once at the office,
they say, dogs help relieve stress and provide security for people
who keep late hours.
</P>
<P>
   It can also make one's life seem less compartmentalized. ``The
dog is my continuity _ a symbol of the seamlessness of work and
home and social life,'' said Barbara Brooks, the communications
director at Manhattanville College in Purchase, whose Labrador
retriever, Charlotte, can be found nestled under her desk three or
four days a week.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, dogs are not making their debut in the hushed,
button-down environs of large investment banks and law firms. But
they are leaving their paw prints at smaller, more creative
companies and nonprofit institutions. Some companies, like the
online services firm Talking Dog Media in Seattle, even have an
``open dog policy'' as a way to attract employees.
</P>
<P>
   Usually someone makes the first move: the boss or a high-ranking
employee arrives with dog in tow, and others follow. At
Manhattanville College, for instance, there seems to be a
contagion, with the dean of students bringing her cairn terrier to
the office, the athletic director his chow, the head librarian her
Scottish terrier, the head of health services her poodle and the
director of development her dachshund.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brooks found out about the opening for her position from the
vice president of student affairs and dean of students, Mary
Corrarino. The two had first met at a dog run in Manhattan. When
Ms. Brooks drove to Manhattanville for her interview, she was
surprised to see Annie, Ms. Corrarino's cairn terrier, in the
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of working in higher education and living in
Westchester County was very appealing,'' Ms. Brooks said. ``The
notion of having my dog curled up at my feet was terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone applauds the trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's loathsome,'' said Judy Jacksina, the owner of the
Jacksina Company, a public relations firm representing Broadway and
Off Broadway shows. ``There are so many pressures at work, and if
you're the other person in the office, it's not fair. Can we all
bring cats? What about goldfish? Where does it stop?''
</P>
<P>
   Most dog-friendly companies require that dogs be well mannered,
housebroken and free of fleas. Many employees who do not have dogs
do seem to genuinely enjoy having a colleague's or boss' dog
underfoot. Others, however, say they merely tolerate the office
mascot.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Lees, the business manager of the Buddhist magazine
Tricycle, has survived a decade of dogs in her Manhattan office,
all belonging to the editor in chief and founder, Helen Tworkov.
</P>
<P>
   First there was Moses, a German shepherd who was ``affectionate
and wise'' but who growled at Ms. Lees on her first day of work.
Then there was Max, an ``extremely annoying and very needy''
dachshund. Now there is Mambo, a ``big mutt with a lot of
personality'' who ``ran around like crazy'' in his youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a rule, I don't like it,'' Ms. Lees said of sharing office
space with her boss' pet. ``While I find the dogs charming, it's
disruptive. We've occasionally had soiled carpets and lunches
scarfed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Human resources administrators say the practice of allowing dogs
in the workplace can pose health risks for employees who are
allergic to animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``When do the rights of one employee begin to infringe on the
rights of another employee?'' asked Donna M. Thiessen, past
president of the National Human Resources Association, a
professional organization based in Milwaukee. ``You don't need your
dog to do your job, but you do need to be free of allergic
symptoms. I don't know how companies balance that.''
</P>
<P>
   At Talking Dog Media, the answer is simple: people averse to
dogs need not apply. ``In the interview we ask people whether they
like dogs and if they are allergic to dogs,'' said Jean Miller, a
spokeswoman for the multimedia and educational software company.
``If you don't like dogs or you're allergic, this is not the
company for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, there was a bark at her doorstep. ``No,'' Ms. Miller
told Zecke, a Shetland sheepdog pup. ``You have to go to your
mommy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mommy'' is the company president, Lisa Khatib, who began
welcoming all dogs after she discovered that an employee was
leaving two bichons frises in the car. ``It's become a perk,'' Mrs.
Khatib said. ``It did not start out that way, but it's one of those
happy accidents.''
</P>
<P>
   While dogs are trotting off to the office, other pets, whether
cats, birds or gerbils, continue to be left largely at home. Cats,
of course, are commonly spotted in the city's corner bodegas and
greasy spoons, where they prowl for mice.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say house cats in particular are much less adaptable
than dogs to the workplace. ``You can't take a cat daily because a
cat is too spooked by strange environments,'' said Dr. Wallace
Sife, a Brooklyn psychologist who specializes in the loss of a pet.
``You'd have to keep it in the cage the entire time, and the whole
purpose of bringing a pet is for a pleasant exchange during the
day.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, dogs have become increasingly common sidekicks
for small business owners like Diane Mancher, whose public
relations firm, One Potato Productions, specializes in book
publishing.
</P>
<P>
   The pit bull terrier-Doberman pinscher mix makes Ms. Mancher and
the four account executives in her office feel protected. ``We're
all women, and we have a lot of messengers and delivery guys,'' she
said. ``Occasionally, they ask for a drink or want to use the
bathroom. When they see the dog, they are a lot less chatty and
pushy.''
</P>
<P>
   Some dogs have better attendance records than their owners. When
the theatrical agent Gary Krasny was out with pneumonia in April,
his 4-year-old bichon frise, Emma, showed up at his Times Square
office every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``My boyfriend or a colleague would pick her up in the morning
and take her home at night,'' he said. ``She can't stand it when
she stays home. She's a working dog.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no dog has received more attention in Manhattan than
Boomer, the golden retriever who belongs to Parks Commissioner
Henry J. Stern. But of late, the most publicized office dog in the
city is Lil, a bichon-wheaten terrier mix and the constant
companion of Marilyn Mode, the deputy commissioner for public
information of the New York City Police Department. It seems that
Lil's every misdeed, whether swiping a lunch or nipping a
sergeant's foot, is reported by the Newsday columnist Leonard
Levitt, who covers the police department.
</P>
<P>
   It was big news last year when an anonymous letter was sent to
the city's Health Department complaining of Lil's presence, and
Police Commissioner Howard Safir, after asking the legal department
to look into it, then declared that Lil could stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hours are rather unpredictable, and the commissioner
indulges me,'' Ms. Mode said in a recent interview. But she has
grown weary of Levitt's sardonic scrutiny of 20-pound Lil.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Roosevelt said about Fala,'' she said, referring to
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and his beloved Scottish
terrier. ``When FDR was accused of sending a gunboat back to pick
up Fala, he said he was used to the press taking shots at him and
his family, but he resented their going after Fala. Well, Lil
resents it, and so do I.''
</P>
<P>
   MBS Associates, a marketing firm in Montrose, which promotes
animal adoptions and pet products, participated in last month's
Take Your Dog to Work Day. The firm sponsored contests like ``best
dressed,'' ``most congenial,'' ``best trick'' and ``most
obedient.'' The president, Mal B. Schwartz, who has a mutt named
Dvorak, is thinking of allowing dogs every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The policy should be explored,'' he said. ``It adds to the
camaraderie around the office. People feel really good about it.
You know, there's more to working than getting work done.''

IMPROVING WEST SIDE NEIGHBORHOOD WORRIES SOME RESIDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 MATT STEARNS  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Despite everything, you still see Adolfo
Celedon in the old neighborhood. Walking the streets he has known
for 50 years, feeding the cats, chatting up the few friends who are
left.
</P>
<P>
   Some nights, he parks his minivan in front of the two-story
brick house at 1637 Jefferson St. that was home for much of his
life. Parks it, takes a long look at the old place, then ambles
down the hill to his new home. His new home, Celedon says, isn't a
safe place to park a car at night.
</P>
<P>
   Celedon's old West Side neighborhood is improving in many ways.
His former house, like many in the area, is being renovated inside
and out.
</P>
<P>
   Appraisals have increased, in some cases dramatically. The value
of a rehabbed house on the 1600 block of Summit Street, one block
from Celedon's old house, went from less than $5,000 in 1994 to
more than $80,000 this year. During the same time, another house in
that block went from an appraised value of $16,000 to $45,851.
</P>
<P>
   New people are moving into what has long been a working-class,
largely Hispanic community, slowly changing the character of the
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   But not everybody wins when urban neighborhoods change this way,
when property values go up and cafes and art galleries sprout in
corner storefronts.
</P>
<P>
   Among the losers: Longtime neighborhood residents such as the
65-year-old Celedon. People who suddenly find themselves searching
for affordable housing after spending their lives in close-knit
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Displacement is a central negative effect of gentrification,''
said Neil Smith, a professor of urban geography at Rutgers
University. ``It especially affects older residents on fixed
incomes.''
</P>
<P>
   And it may become a bigger problem as long-stagnant, inner-city
housing markets _ such as Kansas City's West Side _ continue to
rebound, said Chris Walker, director of Community and Economic
Development for the Urban Institute, a Washington think tank.
</P>
<P>
   It can happen in a variety of ways.
</P>
<P>
   Renters can be priced out of the neighborhood as rents rise or
when apartments are converted into condominiums.
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners can be the victims of higher property tax bills they
can't afford to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Increased code enforcement in blossoming neighborhoods can leave
financially strapped homeowners with fines to pay and repairs to
make _ and feelings of having no choice but to sell. That's a
particular concern on the West Side. A recent community meeting
drew about 60 residents and revealed deep neighborhood divisions on
the issue of code enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   An official in Mayor Kay Barnes' office is exploring how to
address the problem.
</P>
<P>
   But however displacement happens, it can send a once-ordered
life reeling.
</P>
<P>
   Celedon's new place is just a few blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   A room on the second floor of the Roslin Hotel. A spare,
40-watt-bulb type of place. A dresser, an end table. A compact
refrigerator and a toaster oven in one corner. A mini TV on the one
chair, so Celedon's visitors, when he has them, have to perch on
the big metal bed that dominates the room. He shares the bathroom
down the hall. No shower; just a tub, a toilet and a sink beneath a
dirty mirror whose frame is held together by duct tape.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it has the one amenity that counts _ it's as close to the
old neighborhood as he can get.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the feeling in my body, in my head,'' Celedon said.
``That's where I spent most of my years. Me, my mother, my wife,
all the people in the neighborhood. I liked the West Side.''
</P>
<P>
   Celedon arrived on the West Side from Mexico as a teen-ager in
June 1949, after his mother married a man who had a house there.
</P>
<P>
   He learned English and built a life. He worked on the railroads,
trained as a welder, got married. Celedon, his wife, Ernestina, and
Celedon's mother settled in the house on Jefferson Street.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, Celedon's mother died. Ten years later, Ernestina, a
diabetic, succumbed to a series of strokes. Celedon eventually
retired.
</P>
<P>
   But Ernestina's illness had left him with debts. Bills piled up.
And the neighborhood changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``People moved in,'' he said. ``They're always talking about the
home repair because they have the money to do it. A lot of people,
they don't have the money.''
</P>
<P>
   The people spending money to fix up the houses like the
neighborhood's economic diversity, said Kathy Marchant, who moved
into the neighborhood in 1982 and opened the Bluebird Cafe, a
vegetarian restaurant, in 1994 at 1700 Summit St.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a diverse group of people trying to build something,''
Marchant said. ``It's the healthiest urban environment I've ever
lived in.This should be a model for urban redevelopment.''
</P>
<P>
   She chafed at using the word ``gentrification'' to describe
what's happening on the West Side.

IMPROVING WEST SIDE NEIGHBORHOOD WORRIES SOME RESIDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 MATT STEARNS  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ... happening on the West Side.
</P>
<P>
   ``That implies, `We don't care about your life,' &UR; '' Marchant
said. ``Rich guys moving in on the poor guys. And I don't perceive
that happening here.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Brooks, a friend of Celedon's who has lived in the
neighborhood for 45 years, doesn't share Marchant's perception.
Brooks doesn't have a problem with his new neighbors fixing up
their houses. But he said it can cause problems for some of the
older neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're putting some big money into some of those houses,''
Brooks said. ``It puts a hurting on the little man who can't afford
it. Next thing you know, city codes come out. They write you up,
write you up, write you up, you have to sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Increased code enforcement is often the first sign of impending
displacement, said Joyce Probst of the Chicago Rehab Network, a
housing group that has studied displacement in that city.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Code enforcement) is one of the more subtle ways people are
made to feel uncomfortable in an area they've lived in a long
time,'' Probst said.
</P>
<P>
   Code enforcement is thriving on the West Side, according to a
May report by the city's Neighborhood and Community Services
Department. The code inspection area based at the West Side
Community Action Network center had the highest average monthly
number of cases during the preceding six months of any of the seven
inspection areas based at such centers.
</P>
<P>
   The West Side averaged 169 code enforcement cases per month,
according to the report. The next-highest average was 154, in the
Gracemor area. The average monthly number of cases for all seven
areas was 117.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think code enforcement is being used as a tool over
there to drive out the less fortunate,'' said Donovan Mouton,
Barnes' neighborhood advocate. ``Maybe the bar of expectation has
been raised a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Celedon said he did his best to keep his place up, doing the
little things he could do himself. It wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   A code enforcement officer cited him for an overgrown back yard.
Then, Celedon couldn't afford to properly fix his leaking roof,
which heavily damaged the inside of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Scared, Celedon sold his house last October.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have no money, you're forced to sell the house for
whatever you can get, because someone will turn you in to city
hall,'' Celedon said. ``I didn't have the money to do it. I didn't
want to move out of the neighborhood. I wanted to stay until I got
old.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to discount fear as a reason for selling a house after
nearly a half-century.
</P>
<P>
   But experts say fear is a powerful motivator among immigrants
once code enforcement officers start citing a neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may not know this isn't a felony,'' said Walker of the
Urban Institute. ``This is not going to get you sent back to
Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   On the West Side, longtime residents say code enforcement has
focused on long-ignored violations.
</P>
<P>
   The community meeting last month only highlighted the
differences between longtime residents and newcomers when it comes
to code enforcement. Several older residents said newcomers were
trying to impose their own high-end aesthetics on the West Side.
Newcomers pointed out that code enforcement laws were designed to
promote safety.
</P>
<P>
   Larry and Nancy Dunaway have lived in their Jefferson Street
house for 23 years. They were fined $71 for having an old Ford
Mustang on a ramp in their back yard. The fine angered the
Dunaways, but they're more worried about Nancy Dunaway's parents,
who have lived in the house across the street for 42 years.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmie and Mabel Goss are in their 70s, retired and in poor
health with little money. Most of the time, you can find them on
their front porch, watching what little of the world passes their
part of Jefferson Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they do is sit over there and worry,'' Larry Dunaway said.
</P>
<P>
   To Celedon, neighborliness seems to have been lost in the
transition. Nowadays, he said, people just don't seem willing to
lend a hand to a struggling neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect them to give me money,'' Celedon said. ``But
give me a hand, like in the old days. There was good people. People
would help.''
</P>
<P>
   Some help might be on the way. Mouton, of the mayor's office,
said he hopes to start a local committee soon to offer city or
community assistance to those cited for code violations who seem to
want to make the needed repairs.
</P>
<P>
   There are other ways to combat displacement.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City has set aside money to help struggling homeowners
pay for repairs of code enforcement violations. Many local
nonprofit groups, including the West Side Housing Organization,
offer low-interest loans for home repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Other solutions could include exemptions from increased property
taxes for longtime homeowners, and rent control at some apartments,
Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm willing to look at any creative ideas that reach a common
solution, that give people the freedom to live where they want
to,'' Mouton said.
</P>
<P>
   But, Mouton added, folks have to take care of their properties.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, nothing can guarantee that people won't be
displaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people of different backgrounds find it difficult to live
together, the people of the lower economic status will be slowly
eased out,'' Probst said. ``That's just the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Celedon is not quite sure what to do with himself. He thinks of
looking for a new place; he considers moving back to Mexico. He
sits on the bed, writing poetry and songs in Spanish. He has
drawers full of poems and songs.
</P>
<P>
   Celedon worries about other folks still living in the
neighborhood, people like Jimmie and Mabel Goss. He hopes they
don't suffer the same fate he did. And he hopes the new neighbors
see the wisdom of helping out the older residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want the neighborhood to improve,'' he said, ``they need
to help each other.''

PRIVATE MAILBOX SERVICES CALL NEW POSTAL RULES UNFAIR   
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Conn.)   By MICHAEL BRICK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vincent Cobb never knows what he will find in the
six-by-nine-inch mailbox he rents for his modest consulting
business. But recently, even he was surprised when, among the usual
bills, proposals and letters, he found a disturbing notice: All his
mail is wrongly addressed, and as soon as October he may open the
box to find nothing at all.
</P>
<P>
   On Cobb's letterhead, the box is Suite 373 of a tony Wilshire
Boulevard address in Santa Monica, Calif. But under new Postal
Service regulations, Cobb's mail must bear the label PMB, for
private mailbox. Otherwise it will be marked ``Undeliverable as
Addressed'' and returned to the sender. On top of that, mailbox
renters must disclose their home addresses to the Post Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an impossibility,'' Cobb said. ``I don't know who's
going to send me mail.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes have prompted a flurry of indignant letters to
Congress from people who receive their mail through stores like
Pakmail and Mail Boxes Etc. Around 2 million Americans rent boxes
at 10,000 such stores, up from 7,000 a decade ago, often to lend
their business addresses prestige, sometimes because they have no
fixed address. Store owners and mailbox renters say the new rules
invade their privacy and pose a financial threat to their
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   To comply with the regulations adopted in March, stores are
gathering new applications from all customers. To rent a mailbox,
customers must now submit two forms of identification showing their
home addresses, which will be kept on file and reported to the
Postal Service. Law enforcement agencies and credit card companies
asked for the requirements, citing rampant mail fraud.
</P>
<P>
   As the debate flares, the Postal Service is benefiting from an
uncanny fluke of timing. Concerns about mail fraud gained credence
in recent weeks after the government issued a warrant for the
arrest of Martin R. Frankel, the money manager accused of pulling
off the most elaborate mail fraud ever. Frankel used Mail Boxes
Etc. to receive mail for several dummy corporations, court records
show.
</P>
<P>
   Few people dispute that the new safeguards will take a bite out
of crimes like identity theft, in which a person rents a mailbox in
someone else's name and applies for credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   But small business owners worry about the cost. Even if they
notify everyone who regularly sends them mail, every business card
they have handed out without a PMB will have been for naught.
</P>
<P>
   The letter-writing campaign has spawned a lobbying group now
plying Congress to overturn the regulations. Rep. Ron Paul,
R-Texas, has filed a resolution that would nullify the changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a small-business man, spending $5,000 or $10,000 for
new stationery can just ruin your business,'' said Michael
Sullivan, a spokesman for Paul.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service adopted the regulations over the objections
of 8,097 letter writers, most of them small business owners. Only
10 comments favored the changes, although those came from weightier
authors like American Express and the Secret Service. A spokesman
for the Postal Service said fighting fraud outweighed the right to
use ``suite'' on a letterhead. While not the criminal kind, that
small deception is a bit of a fraud in itself, added Norm
Schrestrom, spokesman for the Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a cloak of anonymity,'' he said. The uproar over PMB
``will be much ado about nothing once people get used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, dissension reigns. Given that the Postal
Service competes with the stores for business, conspiracy theories
abound.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a huge burden on the actual small businesses, people
using the service and people providing the service,'' Sullivan
said. ``One can only conclude that it is to drive these out of
business.''
</P>
<P>
   The conflict has owners of Mailboxes Etc. stores doing verbal
somersaults as they phrase their criticism of the regulations. The
stores are franchises with separate owners, but 250 of them have
secured deals with the Postal Service to buy stamps at a discounted
rate, making them loath to rock the boat.
</P>
<P>
   The privacy concerns have made for some unlikely bedfellows.
Last week, both the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence
and the National Coalition for the Homeless denounced the plan to
require home addresses. Abused spouses do not want their addresses
known, while the homeless have no addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Since adopting the regulations, the Postal Service has noticed
that the plan contradicts privacy rules spelled out in its own
charter. On Friday, the service proposed revisions that would allow
only law enforcement agencies to obtain home addresses. But
conflicting proposals under consideration now would still have the
PMB requirement take effect by October 1999 or April 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, mailbox renters envision all manner of
catastrophes if their mail is returned. Many business owners
receive their personal mail in the rented boxes as well, and some
fear they could miss anything from a tax form to a product recall
notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have to contact 1,500 to 2,000 people that I know
of,'' said Rick Merritt, a computer consultant who has dropped
everything to run the hastily assembled group Postal Watch. ``The
real problem is the ones I don't know of.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the changes argue that the Postal Service has no
right to decide what mail will be delivered. Small business owners
said that marking their mail ``Undeliverable'' would mislead the
person who shelled out 33 cents for the stamp.
</P>
<P>
   Extending the grace period to April seems to have pleased no
one. Instead of switching to PMB in the proposed six months, Cobb
is considering simply ignoring the new rules out of existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm willing to do that in theory, but I'm not going to be the
first to jump off the pier,'' he said. ``As soon as somebody has
provable damages, there will be a lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, small business owners have done their homework.
Merritt went so far as to look up the laws regarding suing the
Postal Service. He is pretty sure he can clear up to $1,000 plus
legal fees the first time he can prove the regulations cost him a
piece of mail.
</P>
<P>
   After the money, it is that presumed stigma that vexes box
holders most.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do in fact have an office on Wilshire Boulevard,'' Cobb
said. ``It's six by nine inches, but it's mine.''

TOTAL FINA IN HOSTILE BID FOR ELF ACQUITAINE

 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Total Fina SA announced a hostile bid
Monday for Elf Acquitaine SA worth nearly $43 billion, setting off
the third big takeover battle in France this year, this time in the
oil industry,
</P>
<P>
   Elf Acquitaine, an oil refiner and chemicals conglomerate,
quickly denounced the offer and lined up a stable of investment
banks to plot its defense. Its response set the stage for a raucous
new corporate battle that follows the one between France's biggest
banks and the recent battle between two French financiers for
control of Gucci.
</P>
<P>
   Investors and analysts began betting on an extended battle that
could very likely lead to a counteroffer from Elf Acquitaine or to
rival bids from other oil companies, and shares of Elf Acquitaine
surged 21.5 percent on the Bourse in Paris Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As in the three-way takeover battle between the big French
banks, Total's offer reflects both how much and how little French
business has changed in the last year or so.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, the hostile bid marks another outbreak of
politically incorrect corporate behavior in a country where
takeovers have traditionally been negotiated quietly behind closed
doors. Yet, Total Fina's executives are banking in part on French
nationalist instincts to win their case. Elf Acquitaine was once
owned by the French government, and Paris retains a so-called
``golden share'' to veto any merger it does not like.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted with a number of huge-scale combinations recently
among the world's biggest oil companies, Total is portraying itself
as the only partner for Elf Acquitaine that would enable it to keep
up with the competition and still remain in French hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it is necessary today to join forces to assure the
continued solid growth and to take our place as an oil major of the
first rank at a time when the industry is restructuring on a global
scale,'' said Total Fina's chairman, Thierry Desmarest.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from years of extremely low oil prices, British
Petroleum acquired Amoco for $55 billion and is now trying to
acquire ARCO. And Exxon is in the process of acquiring Mobil for
more than $80 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Total Fina is itself the result of an $11 billion merger
between Total SA of France and Petrofina SA of Belgium. The
exchange of those shares closed last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   If Desmarest is successful with his new bid, the combination of
Elf Acquitaine and Total Fina would have sales around $67 billion
and be the fourth-largest oil company after Exxon-Mobil, BP Amoco
and Royal Dutch/Shell.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Paris on Monday, Desmarest said he was
optimistic about winning the government's approval.
</P>
<P>
   But Elf Acquitaine is almost certain to lobby for a government
rejection. The company has been laying its own plans for
acquisitions as part of a broader corporate restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the two companies said executives had exchanged
ideas for months, ever since British Petroleum announced its
agreement to acquire Amoco.
</P>
<P>
   When the talks failed to produce a deal, Desmarest moved on his
own. Advised by Credit Suisse First Boston, Merrill Lynch and
Paribas Capital, Total Fina began earnest planning for the takeover
in March.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the company said it would offer four of its own shares
for three of Elf Acquitaine.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a premium of about 15 percent over the Elf
Acquitaine closing price on Friday of 145.9 euros, or $149.40. The
stock closed Monday at 177.30 euros, while Total Fina shares edged
up four-tenths of 1 percent, to 128.5 euros. The surge in the Elf
Acquitaine shares essentially eliminated the premium over current
prices, reflecting investors' belief that Total or some other
company would be successful.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Elf Acquitaine's management poured cold water on
the plan. ``The offer has not been the subject of any study or
discussions with Elf's management, and is therefore considered as
being hostile,'' the company said in a terse statement Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of investment banks from Wall Street and Europe sought
the right Monday to advise Elf Acquitaine on its takeover defense.
Among those offering their services were Goldman, Sachs; Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter; Lazard Freres, and Societe Generale.
</P>
<P>
   Phillip Cantelaube, an oil industry analyst with Credit Lyonnais
Securities in Paris, said Total Fina's offer was hardly generous.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would be getting Elf for a very cheap price,'' he said.
Partly for that reason, he added, Total's bid is probably just the
first salvo in a long battle. ``This will go on for a long time and
there will be a lot of turns,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Total paid a substantially higher premium of nearly 37
percent when it acquired Petrofina. But Christophe de Margerie,
Total's president for production and exploration, said that Elf
Acquitaine's stock had already appreciated somewhat in the last
several months as a result of takeover speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Desmarest said he had tried without success in the last three
months to persuade the Elf Acquitaine chief executive, Phillippe
Jaffre, on the wisdom of a friendly merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to make him more sensitive to the advantages of this
approach,'' he said at a news conference in Paris. ``I was not
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the deal is approved, the combined company would be half
the size of the combined Exxon and Mobil. Together, Total and Elf
Acquitaine produce about 2.1 million barrels of oil and oil
equivalents a day, compared with about 4.3 million barrels produced
by Exxon and Mobil.
</P>
<P>
   Desmarest contended that a merger with Elf Acquitaine would
yield about $1.2 billion a year in savings and ``synergies.'' The
two companies both have operations in the North Sea, Iran and in
other areas, though Total has been more focused on the Middle East
and Far East. Total has much smaller operations in the United
States, including about 2,000 gasoline stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we like about the deal is not only the potential for
synergies, but for growth,'' de Margerie said during a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's move is not the first time that Desmarest, 54, has
made a bold move. Two years ago, Total was one of the first Western
oil companies to strike a major refining deal with Iran, defying
U.S. Government protests. Since then, Elf Acquitaine and others
have followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   Desmarest attracted considerable attention earlier this year
with his purchase of Petrofina, a move that made Total slightly
bigger than Elf Acquitaine.

WHERE CAMPAIGN DONATIONS TO MISSOURI AND KANSAS SENATORS AND
CONGRESSMEN ORIGINATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. Reps. Pat Danner and Karen McCarthy of Kansas
City breezed back into office last fall with plenty of money from
political action committees but virtually nothing from individuals
giving less than $200 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just what the two Democrats wanted.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to how incumbents raise money, wide differences
exist among members of Congress from Missouri and Kansas, data from
the Center for Responsive Politics show.
</P>
<P>
   The amount House incumbents received from individuals giving
$1,000 or less in 1997-98 ranged from 3 percent by Danner _ the
lowest in all of Congress _ to 67 percent for Rep. Jim Talent, a
St. Louis Republican who now is running for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Political action committees accounted for 79 percent of Danner's
money, but only 30 percent of Talent's. On average, House
incumbents got about 42 percent of their money from PACs, which can
give up to $5,000 to each candidate in the primary and that much
more in the general.
</P>
<P>
   Among the four area senators, Missouri Republican John Ashcroft
took the least (24 percent) from PACs dating back to 1993, while
Kansas Republican Pat Roberts took the most (50 percent) since his
jump from the House in 1996. The Federal Election Commission
numbers indicate incumbent senators seeking re-election overall
took 25 percent from PACs in the last two-year cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Although recent proposals on campaign finance reform have
focused on large, corporate ``soft money'' contributions that
benefit candidates indirectly, PACs still get significant attention
from critics and candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, people should have a problem if a candidate is
relying overwhelmingly on special-interest PAC money for their
campaign,'' said Eric Schmeltzer, spokesman for Public Campaign, a
Washington group advocating public funding for candidates who limit
private contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Some politicians, however, said there is little difference
between getting contributions from individuals and from PACs.
Danner said PACs are a way for people in various professions,
unions or causes to be supportive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a conglomerate of small donors who otherwise couldn't
make an impact or a statement,'' McCarthy said. ``Those are your
teachers and your nurses. They gather together to make
contributions that are meaningful.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy received about 60 percent of her campaign money in
1997-98 from PACs. As for individual contributions, she received
only 2 percent from people giving $200 or less but 30 percent from
those giving $200 to $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   In sharp contrast, Rep. Ike Skelton, a Lexington, Mo., Democrat,
received 23 percent of his individual contributions from people who
gave $200 or less and 18 percent from those giving $200 to $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always gotten small donations. It's a matter of seeking
donations from everyone,'' Skelton said. ``People, whether they
write a $25 check or a $100 check, want to be part of the process.
I really appreciate that.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy said that instead of taking money from small
contributors last year, she threw them a party at a Westport bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a conscious decision not to raise money from small
donors in this election cycle,'' McCarthy said. ``They had been so
important in my first election, we just wanted to thank them.''
</P>
<P>
   Danner, who also didn't have a strong opponent last fall, said
she had no reason to raise money from individuals. In the 1995-96
election cycle, 21 percent of her money came from individuals.

   ... money came from individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I have a serious enough (election) challenge, I'll go
back to my contributors and they'll be there for me,'' Danner said.
``I don't believe in asking for money just to be asking for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Danner had fund-raisers in Washington and collected more than
$190,000 from political action committees over the 1997-98 period.
She raised money in Washington so people wouldn't wonder about her
intent to run again, she said, adding it was also to build reserves
in case she has significant opposition in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   A potential contender, Kansas City Councilwoman Teresa Loar,
expressed no surprise that Danner raised so little from individuals
and so much from PACs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few people here really have any contact with her,'' said
Loar, a Northland Republican. ``I've yet to run into anyone who's
had any contact with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Loar said she also disagrees that PAC money is basically money
from individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``PAC money is special-interest money,'' Loar said. ``I'm not
opposed to PAC money, but I've been in politics long enough to know
that those who give money will come knocking at your door.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that PACs expect something for their money is evident
in that they give much more to incumbents than to challengers, said
Tony Raymond of Public Disclosure Inc., a group that analyzes
campaign spending data.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take a cynical look because they only support the party in
power,'' Raymond said.
</P>
<P>
   PACs gave $158 million to incumbents in House and Senate races
in the last election cycle and only $21.5 million to their
challengers.
</P>
<P>
   A few members of Congress, such as Republican Rep. Jim Leach of
Iowa, have a policy against taking any PAC money. Leach would like
to abolish PAC money, although that is not part of major campaign
reform now being weighed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The congressman believes that the way special interests work
corrupts the system and if you don't tie yourself to PACs by
accepting their money, your vote is never in question,'' Leach
spokesman Doug Wagner said.
</P>
<P>
   But David Rehr, president of the National Association of
Business PACs, said that PACs are not seen anymore as a
special-interest evil, as proven by the absence of bills to limit
their influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Members are more educated about what PACs are,'' Rehr said.
The fact that donations to PACs must be disclosed eases concern, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft, facing a re-election challenge from Missouri Gov. Mel
Carnahan, said he wasn't aware he received almost three times as
much from individuals as from PACs since first running in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'm low on PACs or high on people,'' Ashcroft
said. ``No money goes into PACs that individuals don't give.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts' chief of staff and former campaign manager, Leroy
Towns, said he didn't know that Roberts has raised a comparatively
high 50 percent of his money from PACs since running in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's harder to raise the kind of dollars from
individuals in Kansas that you might raise in California or more
urban states,'' Towns said.
</P>
<P>
   Among contributions from individuals, 34 percent of Roberts'
money has come from people outside of Kansas. That compares to 31
percent for the other Kansas senator, Sam Brownback. In Missouri,
Ashcroft raised 18 percent from individuals from out of Missouri,
compared to 36 percent for Republican Kit Bond.
</P>
<P>
   House members tend to receive a smaller percentage of money from
out-of-state than do senators, but not always. Skelton, for
example, got 35 percent of his individual contributions from
non-residents of Missouri. McCarthy got 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Responsive Politics calculated the percentages
but had no figures that were expanded to include money from PACs.
</P>
<P>
   The United States Public Interest Research Group is lobbying for
campaign reforms that would include a law against raising more than
25 percent of funds from outside of election districts, including
PAC money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be appropriate for small contributors in a district
to form a PAC,'' said Derek Cressman, democracy campaign director
for the group. ``We're not opposed to PACs, but the reality is a
great amount of money is coming from outside the districts.''

U.S. GETS ROUSING WELCOME
</HEADLINE>

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Moments after the United States women's national
team arrived from China after capturing the 1991 Women's World Cup,
U.S. coach Tony DiCicco admitted he could count the handful of
supporters there to greet them at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   That was eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   If Team USA's arrival from San Francisco to Los Angeles
International Airport for Saturday's Women's World Cup championship
against China at the Rose Bowl is any indication of what lies ahead
-- get ready for a wild week.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. defeated Brazil 2-0 at Stanford Stadium Sunday while
China routed Norway 5-0 in the other semifinal, setting up
Saturday's rematch of the 1996 Olympic Gold Medal match, won by the
United States, 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   There were hundreds of young fans at the airport Monday, hoping
to get a glimpse of Mia Hamm, Briana Scurry, Michelle Akers, or
whoever their favorite player might be.
</P>
<P>
   Midfielder Julie Foudy captured the moment with a video camera
as the team passed by fans under an arch of balloons and past a
line of young girls restrained by rope's. As a band played, girls
wearing World Cup shirts pressed yellow sunflowers into some
players' hands and chanted ``U-S-A, U-S-A.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day has been kind of a surprise at the level of support
and notoriety this team is experiencing,'' U.S. coach Tony DiCicco
said. ``This was awesome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never felt like Ricky Martin, but I felt like a coach of
a very, very successful team. A team that's won the hearts of
America and a team that hopefully will win the World Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   For that to happen, the U.S. must beat a sound Chinese team, a
team that has beaten the U.S. twice in the past year and one that
Norwegian coach Per-Mathias Hogmo says has a good chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that China will be the favorite for me, they
already beat the USA twice, so I think they will be the favorite in
the final,'' Hogmo said, ``But they will meet a very enthusiastic
American team so I think it will be an interesting fight.''
</P>
<P>
   China coach Ma Yuanan, speaking after Sunday's victory, is
looking forward to the meeting with the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the best team we've had in a few years,''
said Yuanan. ``Next Saturday, the U.S. will be stronger than (what
we faced) tonight. I want the team (that beat the U.S. on April
25th) to show up.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States was scheduled to practice Monday at
Pomona-Pitzer College, but DiCicco decided to give his players the
day off instead.
</P>
<P>
   They will resume training this morning in preparation for
Saturday's final.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we need some rest,'' said midfielder Carla Overbeck.
``It's a sense of relief and accomplishment (to get to the final)
knowing the quality and caliber of team's that were in this
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're relieved, you're ecstatic and we're going to enjoy it a
little bit before training again for the next one.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a big sigh of relief, because many have counted on the
U.S. to reach the final for the tournament to be considered a
success.
</P>
<P>
   At least the first indication of that came Monday as tournament
organizers announced that the Rose Bowl was sold-out for Saturday's
final.
</P>
<P>
   Now the only piece missing is an American championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just thankful this team is still playing in the
tournament,'' said striker Mia Hamm. ``We've known from day one it
wasn't going to be easy and it hasn't been easy. I think that 3-2
game against Germany really stretched us and I think this game
(against Brazil) stretched us. Now we just have to get ready for
one more.'' &QL;

SELLOUT EXPECTED FOR U.S.-CHINA GAME

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The remaining tickets for Saturday's 1999 FIFA
Women's World Cup championship at the Rose Bowl between the United
States and China were gobbled up Monday as Marla Messing, president
and CEO of the WWC organizing committee, announced that a sell-out
crowd of 85,000 is expected -- a record for a women's only sporting
event.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a sell-out of the final, our biggest day is still to
come,'' said Messing. ``But I think we can say that the tournament
has been a smashing success. This Saturday, the Rose Bowl will be
awash with pageantry, music and tens of thousands of World Cup fans
who are united in their passion for this event. It will be an
occasion to remember for women's sports.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States, 1991 Women's World Cup champions and 1996
Olympic Gold Medalists face China, Silver Medalists in Atlanta and
winner of two of its last three games against the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's match is a doubleheader, featuring a third place game
between Norway and Brazil. Between matches, the closing ceremonies
will be conducted, featuring a performance by singer/actress
Jennifer Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   For the tournament, an average of more than 35,000 have attended
Women's World Cup matches, including over 22,000 for dates not
involving the United States. There have been three crowds of more
than 65,000, including 78,972 at Giants Stadium and 73,123 at
Stanford, Sunday.

U.S. TEAM HAS CAPTURED AMERICA'S HEART
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You can't compare what's happening here to the
1994 World Cup. We were guests at our own party then, enjoying the
drum-beating sounds of the Brazilians and the soccer-crazed fans
from the rest of the world who showed us a thing or two about
passion and loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   There were real tears of pain for the losers, so bad that one
fella from Italy said he would wait a couple weeks before going
home after the Italians lost to Brazil in the final. He said his
country needed time to mourn.
</P>
<P>
   We're certainly not at that point, and maybe we'll never have
that kind of patriotism that hurts so much when you lose. But we
have the U.S. women's national team and regardless of what happens
Saturday when they face China for the Women's World Cup title at
the Rose Bowl, we're going to remember the summer of 1999 -- the
year we fell in love with our American ladies.
</P>
<P>
   Forget for a minute they represent beauty and power, femininity
and toughness, models and role models.
</P>
<P>
   What we love about this team is the kid in their eyes, the
innocence of pure enjoyment that came with winning back in the AYSO
days at your city park. You remember how excited the parent's were
at those games too, most of whom were learning about this sport for
this first time.
</P>
<P>
   That is what these women are all about. You feel the multi-year
friendships they have with one another, and understand what every
backflip, scream and goal scoring dance means to them -- just as
you did your teammate in the sixth grade.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to knock men's soccer to enjoy them. Some have
suggested they show more skill than team's in Major League Soccer,
or that they're more exciting than our U.S. men's team -- and at
some levels, both may be true.
</P>
<P>
   They make this game look so graceful, easy at times because
they've spent over a decade together honing their team game -- and
even blind, they could find each other on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that, in a day when athletes are lucky to stick around
with the same team for a season, this team has become women
together, sharing as much of their lives off the field as they do
on.
</P>
<P>
   You have to appreciate that.
</P>
<P>
   Why is David Letterman plugging them nightly? Why was President
Bill Clinton checking his watch, hoping the referee would end last
week's game against Germany so the U.S. team could advance? Simple.
They have jumped on the wagon for the same reason's as your
neighbor next door, or the friend you have that hates soccer. This
U.S. team is a throwback to what team sports once was -- sacrifice
instead of all-star appearances, championship dreams instead of
money.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, this is Lake Placid all over again. It's not the
Olympics, but we're watching what feels like our buddies from the
neighborhood enjoy the time of their lives in front of sold-out
crowds and millions of television viewers.
</P>
<P>
   In a day when multi-million dollar basketball athletes turn down
invitations to play for our Olympic team because their off-season
schedules are too busy, or tennis standouts turn down U.S. Davis
Cup invitations because of overwork -- thank God we have our U.S.
women's soccer team to show us what representing your country is
all about.
</P>
<P>
   In a day athletes ask children for money in exchange for
autographs and humanitarian award football players get caught
soliciting sex before Super Bowl's -- thank God we have something
pure, something better than that, even if it's for such a short
time.
</P>
<P>
   You want dirt on this team, look on their jerseys, complete with
grass stains and blood. That's how we like it, a team with guts,
one that thrives on pure emotion and players who want to win as
much as the painted-faced kids in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad it has to end this weekend. We're going to miss our
girls of summer. Maybe we'll see them on cereal boxes in month's
ahead or hopefully they will go on a victory tour leading to the
2000 Olympics in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, thanks for the lesson's learned. You showed our
kids and their parents what team sports are all about again. And
thanks for showing our mega-rich athletes that fans care more about
commitment and hard-work than anything else.

<P>
   Vincent Cobb never knows what he will find in the
six-by-nine-inch mailbox he rents for his modest consulting
business. But recently, even he was surprised when, among the usual
bills, proposals and letters, he found a disturbing notice: All his
mail is wrongly addressed, and as soon as October he may open the
box to find nothing at all.
</P>
<P>
   On Cobb's letterhead, the box is Suite 373 of a tony Wilshire
Boulevard address in Santa Monica, Calif. But under new Postal
Service regulations, Cobb's mail must bear the label PMB, for
private mailbox. Otherwise it will be marked ``Undeliverable as
Addressed'' and returned to the sender. On top of that, mailbox
renters must disclose their home addresses to the Post Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an impossibility,'' Cobb said. ``I don't know who's
going to send me mail.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes have prompted a flurry of indignant letters to
Congress from people who receive their mail through stores like
Pakmail and Mail Boxes Etc. Around 2 million Americans rent boxes
at 10,000 such stores, up from 7,000 a decade ago, often to lend
their business addresses prestige, sometimes because they have no
fixed address. Store owners and mailbox renters say the new rules
invade their privacy and pose a financial threat to their
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   To comply with the regulations adopted in March, stores are
gathering new applications from all customers. To rent a mailbox,
customers must now submit two forms of identification showing their
home addresses, which will be kept on file and reported to the
Postal Service. Law enforcement agencies and credit card companies
asked for the requirements, citing rampant mail fraud.
</P>
<P>
   As the debate flares, the Postal Service is benefiting from an
uncanny fluke of timing. Concerns about mail fraud gained credence
in recent weeks after the government issued a warrant for the
arrest of Martin R. Frankel, the money manager accused of pulling
off the most elaborate mail fraud ever. Frankel used Mail Boxes
Etc. to receive mail for several dummy corporations, court records
show.
</P>
<P>
   Few people dispute that the new safeguards will take a bite out
of crimes like identity theft, in which a person rents a mailbox in
someone else's name and applies for credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   But small business owners worry about the cost. Even if they
notify everyone who regularly sends them mail, every business card
they have handed out without a PMB will have been for naught.
</P>
<P>
   The letter-writing campaign has spawned a lobbying group now
plying Congress to overturn the regulations. Rep. Ron Paul,
R-Texas, has filed a resolution that would nullify the changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a small-business man, spending $5,000 or $10,000 for
new stationery can just ruin your business,'' said Michael
Sullivan, a spokesman for Paul.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service adopted the regulations over the objections
of 8,097 letter writers, most of them small business owners. Only
10 comments favored the changes, although those came from weightier
authors like American Express and the Secret Service. A spokesman
for the Postal Service said fighting fraud outweighed the right to
use ``suite'' on a letterhead. While not the criminal kind, that
small deception is a bit of a fraud in itself, added Norm
Schrestrom, spokesman for the Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a cloak of anonymity,'' he said. The uproar over PMB
``will be much ado about nothing once people get used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, dissension reigns. Given that the Postal
Service competes with the stores for business, conspiracy theories
abound.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a huge burden on the actual small businesses, people
using the service and people providing the service,'' Sullivan
said. ``One can only conclude that it is to drive these out of
business.''
</P>
<P>
   The conflict has owners of Mailboxes Etc. stores doing verbal
somersaults as they phrase their criticism of the regulations. The
stores are franchises with separate owners, but 250 of them have
secured deals with the Postal Service to buy stamps at a discounted
rate, making them loath to rock the boat.
</P>
<P>
   The privacy concerns have made for some unlikely bedfellows.
Last week, both the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence
and the National Coalition for the Homeless denounced the plan to
require home addresses. Abused spouses do not want their addresses
known, while the homeless have no addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Since adopting the regulations, the Postal Service has noticed
that the plan contradicts privacy rules spelled out in its own
charter. On Friday, the service proposed revisions that would allow
only law enforcement agencies to obtain home addresses. But
conflicting proposals under consideration now would still have the
PMB requirement take effect by October 1999 or April 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, mailbox renters envision all manner of
catastrophes if their mail is returned. Many business owners
receive their personal mail in the rented boxes as well, and some
fear they could miss anything from a tax form to a product recall
notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have to contact 1,500 to 2,000 people that I know
of,'' said Rick Merritt, a computer consultant who has dropped
everything to run the hastily assembled group Postal Watch. ``The
real problem is the ones I don't know of.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the changes argue that the Postal Service has no
right to decide what mail will be delivered. Small business owners
said that marking their mail ``Undeliverable'' would mislead the
person who shelled out 33 cents for the stamp.
</P>
<P>
   Extending the grace period to April seems to have pleased no
one. Instead of switching to PMB in the proposed six months, Cobb
is considering simply ignoring the new rules out of existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm willing to do that in theory, but I'm not going to be the
first to jump off the pier,'' he said. ``As soon as somebody has
provable damages, there will be a lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, small business owners have done their homework.
Merritt went so far as to look up the laws regarding suing the
Postal Service. He is pretty sure he can clear up to $1,000 plus
legal fees the first time he can prove the regulations cost him a
piece of mail.
</P>
<P>
   After the money, it is that presumed stigma that vexes box
holders most.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do in fact have an office on Wilshire Boulevard,'' Cobb
said. ``It's six by nine inches, but it's mine.''

   CHICAGO _ Hate came to the neighborhoods of Indiana University
in Bloomington in the pre-dawn darkness of the spring of 1998, as a
criminal justice major named Benjamin Smith drove his light blue
Ford Taurus down residential streets, tossing little plastic bags
of pamphlets into yards.
</P>
<P>
   The brochures claimed that the white race was being crowded out
by Jews, blacks and the ``mud people,'' his derogatory term for
Asians.
</P>
<P>
   Hate apparently came again over the Independence Day weekend, as
August Smith _ no longer Benjamin, he told a journalist, because it
sounded too Jewish _ returned to his old haunts in Indiana and
Illinois. According to the police and FBI, the 21-year-old student
drove the same light blue Ford slowly, firing one handgun and then
another at Jews, blacks and Asians.
</P>
<P>
   The deadly visit to Bloomington on Sunday came near the end of a
three-day tear of violence in two states. Before it was over, two
men, one black and one Korean, were dead, both shot in the back,
and nine other Jews, Asians and blacks were wounded. It ended with
a suicide in rural southern Illinois late Sunday night, when Smith
stole a van, was chased by police, and shot himself under the chin,
according to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Those who encountered Ben Smith say they never saw him commit
racially motivated violence before last week, but they saw him
become more willing to express his racist views openly. The
locations of the shootings may not have been random, police and the
FBI say. Smith shot at Orthodox Jews, blacks and Asians on Friday
night in the northern suburbs of Chicago, where he grew up. Ricky
Byrdsong, 43, a former basketball coach at Northwestern University,
was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Saturday Smith shot at blacks and Asians near the
University of Illinois, where he quit before being expelled over
charges of domestic violence, possessing drugs and posting racist
literature.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday he returned to Bloomington, where he had just
completed his third year of college at Indiana University. There,
authorities say, he killed Won Joon Yoon, 26, a Korean-American man
at a church near the school, where Smith's one-man flurry of white
power pamphlets had scared the community into marching against hate
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Smith grew up in the affluent northern suburbs of Chicago, in
Wilmette and Northfield. Neighbors said his father is a doctor, his
mother a real estate agent and former town trustee. He has two
younger brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where he got his racist ideas, who knows?'' said Ruth Hanna, a
neighbor of the family for 16 years in Wilmette. ``There was no
indication it came from the family.''
</P>
<P>
   The quotation that Smith chose for his senior yearbook in 1996
at New Trier High School was ``Sic semper tyrannis,'' Latin for
``thus ever to tyrants,'' the same slogan spoken by John Wilkes
Booth after he shot Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Smith went to college that fall at the University of Illinois,
in Champaign-Urbana, at first in the school of agriculture,
consumer and environmental sciences. He lived in an elite
dormitory, Allen Hall, known for its progressive program of
visiting authors and artists of many cultures and points of view,
university officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last year with an alternative newspaper, Smith
said he had no racist views until he reached the university. He
said felt uncomfortable around so many foreign students and
professors. Then he started to read neo-Nazi literature and met
Matthew F. Hale, of East Peoria, Ill., who was recruiting on campus
for his World Church of the Creator, an anti-black, anti-Christian,
anti-Jewish organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he first met me he had mentioned violence,'' Hale said.
``And I said, `That's not the way to go, brother.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Smith came to the attention of the Illinois campus police in the
fall of his sophomore year. In a single week in October 1997, he
was accused of beating his girlfriend, Elizabeth Ann Sahr, in his
dorm room, then of possessing marijuana, then of fighting with
other students, university officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tried to keep his racism and his anti-Semitism hidden,''
Ms. Sahr said in a telephone interview. ``People really need to pay
more attention to domestic violence and racism.''
</P>
<P>
   In January 1998, because of the charges, Smith was placed on
probation and required to undergo counseling, to take an ethics
class and to perform community service, according to university
records.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days later, he was confronted about racist literature posted
in the dorm. ``He vehemently insisted on his First Amendment
rights, but didn't admit he had done it,'' said Bill Murphy,
associate chancellor for public affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The next month, there were more complaints against Smith:
peeking into dormitory windows, and unconfirmed reports that he had
acquired weapons, Murphy said. Then Smith filed his own complaint
with the school's office of conflict resolution, saying the
dormitory administration was mistreating him.
</P>
<P>
   A week before his disciplinary hearing on the latest charges,
university officials consulted with his parents, and Smith withdrew
from the university, signing a statement promising never to return.
``If he had not withdrawn, he would have been dismissed,'' Murphy
said.
</P>
<P>
   That summer of 1998, Smith enrolled at the University of
Indiana, in Bloomington, where he began publicly expressing racist
views. He switched from computer science to criminal justice,
joining a department known for its interest in crimes against
racial minorities. A recent symposium is suggestive of the
curriculum: ``Challenging Stereotypes and Encouraging Empathy in
the Criminal Justice Classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith soon was placing leaflets of the White Nationalist Party
on cars on campus. After a university official met with him, Smith
wrote a long letter as ``August Smith'' to the Indiana Daily
Student in June 1998 decrying the university's attempt to curb his
free speech rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was true that the fliers were racially-oriented,'' Smith
wrote, ``but to label them racist, bigoted or prejudiced
demonstrates bias.''
</P>
<P>
   He opposed the university's policy of affirmative action as
``racist,'' and called attention to facilities for nonwhite
students, such as the Black Student Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``But where do white people go to discuss their issues and
concerns? There is no White Student Union established to help white
students organize and react to the problems our people face. This
is why the White Nationalist Party was established.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By the Fourth of July weekend in 1998, Smith was openly placing
2,000 flyers under windshields in a wide area of Bloomington. The
text, from the World Church of the Creator, extolled the ``Great
White Race'' and assailed what it called ``a deceitful, alien
government, a controlled media, and a suicidal religion.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor of Bloomington, John Fernandez, encountered Smith
twice, at a rally and on a radio call-in show. ``All indications
were that he didn't have any history of violence,'' Fernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Smith began to give interviews. He offered his views on violence
to Lisa Sorg, managing editor of the Bloomington Independent, as
they sat in the Encore Cafi in Bloomington last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we can legally come to power through nonviolence,''
Smith said, ``but Hale says if they try to restrict our legal means
then we have no recourse but to resort to terrorism and violence.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had received death threats, but wasn't afraid. ``I'm
more afraid for my race than myself,'' he said. ``Nature isn't
concerned with the individual, but with the species.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he still spoke with his parents, but didn't have the
friends at home that he used to have. He calls his former friends
``race traitors.''
</P>
<P>
   While some members of the Church of the Creator wanted to
partition the nation into areas for different minorities, he told
Ms. Sorg that he wanted to expel racial and religious minorities.
``They won't be very happy to leave, but they'll probably end up
wanting to leave,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said his career goal was to be a lawyer. This spring he
testified for Hale, the World Church leader, who has tried
unsuccessfully to receive a law license in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sorg said that Smith came across as very calm, his voice
flat, his eyes dead. He seemed to have an almost reverential
devotion to Hale almost like a ``schoolgirl crush,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   By November 1998, the community had decided to respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was civic pornography,'' said Jeffrey Willsey, an
organizer of a group called Bloomington United, that formed in
response to the leafletting. ``We felt that because it was in our
yards, and there was a clear attempt to psychologically intimidate
our community, it was important to respond to it.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Smith wrote again to the student paper in November, saying that
the community march did not prove that he was a minority of one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that there has been no massive rejection of the
World Church's materials or ideas,'' Smith wrote. ``The rally was
the product of a diverse gang of special interests groups, none of
which represent the silent white majority of the student body. Most
students do not want a ban of `hate speech.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He also said the pamphlets were not hateful. ``Being familiar
with the literature, I must argue that it is not so much `hate
literature' as much as truth that reflects poorly on nonwhites,''
Smith wrote. ``The World Church stands for free speech and open
dialogue and is willing to debate the issues at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   His writings and distribution of pamphlets sparked a campus
debate on tolerance. The anthropology faculty wrote a letter to the
editor to quarrel with some of the racial history in Smith's
pamphlets.
</P>
<P>
   Smith lived in Touchdown Terrace, a somewhat run-down, 30-unit
student apartment complex with many minority residents. His
neighbors said he glared at minorities but did not act violently.
His only difficulty was that someone kept breaking the windows of
his car and his apartment, as often as once a week, apparently in
retaliation for his writings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about Benjamin `August' Smith, the person in my Race
and Ethnicity class last semester,'' said Tyrese Alexander, 23, a
black student who lived a few doors down from Smith. ``But I had no
idea I was living next to him.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear what set off last week's violence, but Hale, the
World Church leader, believes that he knows. Hale's latest attempt
to become a lawyer in Illinois was rebuffed on Friday by a state
panel. Smith had testified for Hale at a hearing in April, praising
Hale's legal means.
</P>
<P>
   ``He testified that he might be in jail now if it wasn't for
me,'' Hale said. When asked if the adverse decision on Friday might
have sparked the killings, Hale said, ``I do. I very much do.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the accused killer is dead does not make
Bloomington feel safer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben Smith may have taken his own life, but there's still far
too much hatred out there, in the community, in the world,'' said
Rabbi Sue L. Shifron, a founder of Bloomington United.
</P>
<P>
   ``While he may be gone, the organization that he was a part of
and hundreds of other organizations are still out there.''

<P>
   BATES CITY, Mo. _ When he was 15, Andy Anderson decided to build
an airplane.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1929, and he lived outside a small town in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly a lot of spare airplane parts lying around.
</P>
<P>
   But the desire to fly above the fields burned in this farm boy.
He remembered the summer day 11 years earlier when a plane flew
over Dow City. The town celebrated on Main Street. Horses
scattered. People greeted the pilot like a hero.
</P>
<P>
   So when the time came to stop dreaming and start building, Andy
made do with parts from a blacksmith, lumberyard and hardware
store. He used an engine from an old motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   His plane flew.
</P>
<P>
   Not high or far, but it got off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll still fly,'' Anderson, now 86, said Thursday at his
hangar south of Bates City, Mo., in rural Lafayette County. That
homemade plane sits inside, crammed with another dozen or so he has
built or is building.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson has flown for more than 70 years. He's barnstormed and
crop-dusted all over the country. But, in a way, he hasn't traveled
far. The grassy runway he uses now isn't much different from that
Iowa field where he soared 20 feet above the ground when Hoover was
president.
</P>
<P>
   In the evenings, after a day of cutting metal and gluing wood
for wings and fuselages, Anderson flies. As he soars above
cornfields and cow pastures, he thinks what he would like to build
next; what he could do to make a plane fly better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm old, but I still have a boy's ideas,'' he said. He
estimates he's built more than 100 planes.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration says Anderson, who's never
had a flying lesson, is among the last of his kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done things that we read about in books,'' said Walt
Hutchings, a supervisor in the FAA's Kansas City office.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the agency gave Anderson the ``Charles Taylor
Master Mechanic Award,'' named for the man who built the Wright
brothers' first engine.
</P>
<P>
   FAA safety inspector Jerry Garrison has visited Anderson's
runway and hangar often.
</P>
<P>
   ``That old man can dream something up, draw it out on paper,
build it, and it will fly,'' Garrison said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson shares his knowledge and past with his grandson and
great-grandson, Mark and ``Young Andy'' Anderson, who live next to
the hangar.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in this family flies. Mark Anderson built his first
plane when he was in high school. He's taken his planes to shows
and won first prizes.
</P>
<P>
   Mark's son, Andy, 13, has started work on a glider.
</P>
<P>
   It's practically genetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad flies, I fly, my son flies _ we do this because of
him,'' Mark said of his grandfather. ``We all grew up around itwe
heard the stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us ever wanted to walk away.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark's son, Young Andy, put it this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``He (his great-grandfather) told me if I didn't like airplanes,
he would kick my rear,'' the boy said. ``And then he said he'd kick
my rear again just so I wouldn't forget.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gonna help me build my glider.''

</P>
<P>
   Sure, Anderson knows he's doing things most people his age quit
doing 20 years ago _ or never did at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not going to some old-folks home and sit there like a
wilted carrot,'' he said. ``I've got too many things to do.''
</P>
<P>
   People who love airplanes have heard of this man. They've seen
his planes in museums, and they come from all over the country to
visit his hilltop hangar. He says he'd get more work done if people
would leave him alone.
</P>
<P>
   He also restores old cars and trucks. And during the winter, he
writes poetry.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS)I wonder how I lived, but I don't want to boast
</P>
<P>
   I flew the old Eagle by the seat of my pants.
</P>
<P>
   You know, that's what counted the most _
</P>
<P>
   All those stunts and flying I did by chance.(END ITALICS)
</P>
<P>
   One day in the late 1920s, the undertaker in Dow City saw Andy
Anderson running down the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andy! Come here, boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy stopped. The undertaker cupped his hands together and held
them to the youngster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got you right here, Andy. If you don't stop messing with
those airplanes, I'm gonna close 'em up.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy smiled. He already had been in the air and knew there was
no coming down. He'd built a glider. He worked at his grandparents'
lumberyard and instead of taking money, he took his pay in boards.
The yard man sawed them into 1-inch slats.
</P>
<P>
   The story of that first glider has become family lore.
</P>
<P>
   ``He started running down this hill and just about the time he
thought he couldn't run no more, that glider took him up,'' Mark
said. ``That was the first time he flew.''
</P>
<P>
   His second glider could be pulled by a car.
</P>
<P>
   Andy's next project was a Model T powered by a propeller. He put
the engine on backward so he could mount a propeller that he had
carved from a large piece of oak.
</P>
<P>
   He drove his ``contraption'' around the yard until his father
made him take it apart.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the airplane with the motorcycle engine, and he's been
flying ever since.
</P>
<P>
   To get ideas for his early planes, he scraped together enough
gas money to drive to Kansas City, where he watched workers build
the American Eagle at a factory near what's now the Downtown
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd buy me five hamburgers for a nickel apiece and a Dr.
Pepper, and I'd sit there all day and watch them build those
planes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1930s, he was able to buy an Eagle. That's when he
started barnstorming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in those days, small towns would have a ball game on
Sunday afternoon. We'd land and give rides,'' Anderson said. ``I
gave a lot of people their first plane ride.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, he moved to Missouri, where he and his wife raised
three children.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson crop-dusted and worked as an air mapper for the state.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Phyllis, died in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   That fall, he married a schoolteacher 36 years his junior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was dark, and she couldn't see me very good,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he and Diane Anderson live near the hangar. Other family
members live nearby. The dog is Piper. The cat is Scout.
</P>
<P>
   Diane teaches school. Andy builds replicas of vintage planes.
</P>
<P>
   And he writes his poems.

 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENWICH, Conn. _ Five winters ago, Lowell Weicker moved out of
the Connecticut governor's mansion, apparently ending a 30-year
career as one of the nation's best-known political mavericks. At 6
feet 6 inches tall and with a voice to match, he had tormented the
Republican Party from within as a U.S. senator, then led
Connecticut as that uncommon American political animal, an
independent.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Hartford, he settled into life as the lord of
Applejack Farm, a former orchard in this town of private drives and
tradesmen's entrances, taking plenty of time away for tennis,
bird-watching and scuba diving with his seven sons and seven
grandchildren. But he never lost his taste for the game that had
been his life. He flirted with running for president as an
independent in 1996, drawing national headlines, then backed away.
</P>
<P>
   Now, strategists for Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota are trying
to entice Weicker to offer himself as a Reform Party nominee for
president. And Weicker, 68, sounds very much like a man who is
willing to be enticed. In a conference call last week, he gave
Ventura's top aides permission to promote his candidacy as they
prepared for a Reform Party national convention later this month.
</P>
<P>
   The result could be an entertaining clash of egos in a
presidential race that had begun to look as if it might be short on
surprises. Ross Perot, the Reform Party's nominee in 1992 and 1996,
has remained coy about his own plans for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   So Ventura, the former professional wrestler whose upset victory
as a Reform Party candidate last November gave new hope to
independents everywhere, has argued that the party needs new
leaders if it is to grow. Working one front, Ventura has endorsed a
veteran of the term-limits movement to replace the current party
chairman, Russell Verney, a longtime lieutenant of Perot.
</P>
<P>
   Weicker's prospects within the Reform Party may depend on the
ferocious internal battle that leaders expect at the party's
convention, to be held in Dearborn, Mich., from July 23 to 25. As
part of his mission, Ventura encouraged Weicker to run for
president during a meeting in New York last month, according to
aides to both men. The meeting had been scheduled for half an hour
and stretched to more than three, participants said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would I like to run?'' Weicker asked last week as he relaxed
on his sun porch in a wrinkled French shirt with no cuff links.
``Yes, sure _ it's been my business, and I still think I'm pretty
good at the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Unprompted, he began reciting the pros and cons. ``Do I care
about the fact that you might get your head handed to you?'' he
asked. ``Doesn't bother me _ never has. The opportunity to set a
national dialogue on important subjects _ that's hugely appealing.
I'm not afraid of handling myself, not afraid of the crunch _ not
afraid of the campaign. What's the other side of the coin? I'm
enjoying my family and enjoying a lifestyle that I haven't had in
my whole adult life.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Reform Party officials said that although Ventura has
said he does not plan to run for president next year, he wants the
Reform Party to field a credible candidate who will attract at
least 5 percent of the vote, preserving the party's federal
financing and ballot status so he can run in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   But the main motive for boosting Weicker, according to Douglas
Friedline, who was Ventura's campaign manager and now handles his
licensing deals, is to give the Reform Party a face besides that of
Perot. ``Perot got us where we are, but now he's a liability,''
Friedline said. ``Gov. Ventura feels we need new leadership if
we're going to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Weicker contend that an independent should have
broad appeal this year _ partly because of what they believe will
be a backlash against the ravenous fund-raising by Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas, the leading Republican candidate, and partly because
of disgust with the behavior by President Clinton that led to his
impeachment in December.
</P>
<P>
   Weicker, who endorsed Clinton in both his presidential races,
said he favored conviction on the articles of impeachment because
the president apparently had lied in a legal proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Barkley, who was chairman of Ventura's campaign last year
and remains a close adviser, said Weicker would be the most
promising candidate short of Colin Powell, the retired general, who
said through a spokesman that he still had no plans to seek any
national office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lowell Weicker shares with Gov. Ventura the ability to speak
from the heart and to show people that he understands their disgust
with the political establishment,'' Barkley said.

   Based on the vote Perot received as the Reform Party's
presidential nominee in 1996, the party qualifies for $13 million
in federal funds for the general election, and can automatically be
on the ballot in at least 19 states. Political analysts said that a
Reform Party candidate could throw the outcome of the presidential
race in almost any state into doubt by attracting at least 10
percent of the vote.

   Weicker, who swims at 6:30 each morning at the YWCA in
Greenwich, said he wants to insure a centrist, independent option
for voters. In his comments, a supporter might _ just might _ hear
the early rumblings of a stump speech.

   ``The only way you're going to shape up American politics is by
a third force, nationally,'' he said. ``Politics _ the intellectual
business _ is no different than the economic business. When you
have an economic monopoly, you get high prices and bad products.
You've got an intellectual monopoly in this country, and you've got
bad ideas and bad candidates.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Steve Keiner, an Atlantic City engineer, won
this year's Fourth of July hot-dog-eating contest at Coney Island,
his victory was touted as perfect for a patriotic day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to bring it back to the United States,'' he said of
the mustard-yellow leather belt that is awarded to the champion in
the Nathan's Famous contest. It had been in the hands of winners
from Japan for the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   But within hours, Keiner's victory was under scrutiny. Editors
at the cable television station New York 1 said the videotape
showed that Keiner had begun to eat before the starting signal. The
corpulent Keiner, who swallowed 20\ hot dogs in 12 minutes, edged
out ``Hungry'' Charles Hardy, the second-place winner, by a quarter
of a dog.
</P>
<P>
   The starting signal _ a shouted ``Go!'' _ was preceded by a
countdown from 10. On a slow-motion replay of the videotape, Keiner
appears to be taking a bite at ``one.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardy, a 320-pound correction officer, said by telephone Monday
from his home in Brooklyn, ``I've been cheated.'' He said he could
easily have eaten another half of a hot dog during the split
second. He called for a rematch.
</P>
<P>
   But George Shea, a spokesman for Nathan's Famous, which has been
running the annual contests since 1916, said the rules prohibited
rematches. The judges, he said, cannot use instant replays, and the
contestants ``eat with such speed and ability, it can be difficult
to keep track of.'' But reviewing each play on tape would impede
the eating and kill the spontaneity, he said. Keiner denied making
a false start. ``I did not start before anybody else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike DeVito, the 1993 champion, supported Keiner's claim. ``This
guy's a legitimate winner,'' he said. ``We're talking about a split
second, if anything.''
</P>
<P>
   While DeVito said he trained regularly, buying four or five
pounds of spare ribs and other heavy meats at Wall Street delis and
wolfing them down in his office at Goldman, Sachs, where he is a
controller, Keiner said that all he had done to prepare was skip
breakfast Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   There have been questionable maneuvers by hot-dog-eating
contestants in the past, Shea said. Once, at a regional contest in
Yonkers, a contestant soaked the hot-dog buns (which is permitted)
and pushed them through a sieve (which is not), making compact
dough balls. And in 1989, Shea said, a competitive eater was
disqualified after surreptitiously shoving a hot dog onto someone
else's plate.

him the villain British and American television viewers loved to

Pigott-Smith, who is portraying the failed anarchist Larry Slade in
the critically hailed revival of Eugene O'Neill's ``Iceman
Cometh.'' Pigott-Smith's 14 episodes of fame came in the
mid-1980's, when his portrayal of the sadistic police
superintendent Ronald Merrick in ``The Jewel in the Crown'' made
him the villain British and American television viewers loved to
hate. In the ensuing 14 years, Pigott-Smith has had a busy career,
but fame has not been part of it. And, he said, he doesn't miss
it.(Sara Krulwich/New York Times Photo)

MARKET PLACE: INVESTORS' ODD CNET LOGIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cnet was one of the very first companies to build a business on
the World Wide Web, but it has rarely benefited from the special
dispensations that investors accord most Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   Look, for example, at how the market reacted when Real Networks,
another of the oldest Web concerns, announced a deal with the WebTV
unit of Microsoft Corp. on Thursday. Though the deal will bring in
no revenue for Real, its stock reacted with the usual e-euphoria,
surging 27 percent in two days, to $89.94.
</P>
<P>
   Compare that reaction with Cnet's announcement on Wednesday of a
new $100 million ad campaign _ the sort of bold play for growth
that usually titillates Web investors: Cnet's stock dropped by 14
percent Thursday and Friday, to $49.82. The investors' complaint?
Cnet, which has been making that rarest of Internet results, a
profit, would now lose money for a year because of the ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It is as if Cnet were the only freeway driver doing the speed
limit as everyone else zoomed by at 90 mph. Then, just as it
decided to push just a little harder on the gas, it was the one
with the red lights flashing in its rearview window.
</P>
<P>
   Cnet was founded by Halsey Minor in 1992 _ before most investors
had even heard of the Internet _ to create a series of online
services and television programs about computers. And Minor had to
work much harder to raise money _ and then to placate his investors
_ than Internet companies do today. It is hard to imagine today,
but for Cnet's first few years, Wall Street kept complaining that
it was growing rapidly but losing money.
</P>
<P>
   To calm its critics, Cnet tightened its belt, and for the last
four quarters it has managed to be in the black. Meanwhile, a
series of savvy investments produced a stash of stock and cash
worth more than $800 million. Most notably, its decision to build
an Internet portal called Snap, widely derided by investors at the
time as expensive folly, has been transformed through a series of
deals involving NBC and the Internet company Xoom into stock worth
$425 million.
</P>
<P>
   Cnet, moreover, has the proven business model of a trade
publication. It publishes articles of interest to people who buy
computers _ both individuals and corporate decision makers _ then
sells advertising to those who want to reach these prospects. The
Internet allows the company to serve both buyer and seller better
than a magazine can. A consumer can read reviews of computers,
select a model, compare prices for that machine at various
retailers, and click off to vendors' sites to make a purchase.
</P>
<P>
   And although Cnet has hardly spent anything on marketing since
it bought some of the first banner ads ever on Yahoo, it has still
managed to become the 17th most popular Internet service, with 8
million monthly visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, the company assembled analysts in San Francisco
to unveil its expansion into new markets _ consumer electronics and
corporate information systems _ and the new ad campaign. Unlike
most Internet companies, Cnet could tap its own cash reserves for
marketing rather than spending money raised from investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figured the best return we could earn on our cash was to
invest it in growing our own business,'' Douglas Woodrum, the
company's chief financial officer, said in an interview Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were generally pleased, and on Wednesday, Cnet's stock
rose by $3.50, to $57.625. The company, wrote Lanny Baker of
Salomon Smith Barney, has ``established itself as one of the few
Internet companies with a defensible, profitable, working business
model.'' The ad campaign, he estimated, would bring in enough new
viewers to boost revenue by 25 percent by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But by Thursday, as word hit the broader market of the shift
from profit to loss, Cnet's shares plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you announce changes that hurt the near term only to
improve the long term, people tend to just focus on the near
term,'' Woodrum said. ``We're not going to let that stop us from
doing what's right.''
</P>
<P>
   Losses, however, have never dampened investor interest in Real
Networks, for the simple reason that it has never made any money.
Real Networks lost $16 million last year on sales of $65 million.
By contrast, Cnet earned $3 million on sales of $56 million.
</P>
<P>
   Founded by Rob Glaser, a former Microsoft executive, Real
developed a technology that has become the standard for audio and
video programming on the Internet, with an 85 percent share of all
multimedia Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   That is an enviable achievement. But the company has the sort of
convoluted business model so common among Internet companies: It
gives its Real Player software away free and makes money selling an
upgraded software player with more features and selling advertising
on its Web site and on the player itself. The company also sells
the ``server'' software used by operators of Web sites that want to
broadcast in Real formats.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, Microsoft, which once owned 10 percent of Real Networks,
has decided to compete by promoting its own audio and video player.
This caused enough trouble that Glaser testified in a Senate
hearing last year that Microsoft was trying to ``break'' Real's
products.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the announcement last Thursday that WebTV would update the
existing software, used by its interactive television service, to
play the most recent Real Networks formats, was seen by investors
as a sign of some sort of peace offering. It could well be. But
Microsoft is quite adept at continuing to do routine business with
companies it is nonetheless intent on destroying.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it is hard to see how anything in the WebTV deal comes
close to adding the $1.5 billion in market value that investors
accorded Real Networks last week. There is no money changing hands
between Real and Microsoft, and the Web TV version of the player
does not even present an opportunity to sell upgrades or
advertising. At best, the Web site owners that use Real's software
will be more satisfied because they now get access to the 800,000
Web TV users. But it is unclear how this might improve revenues.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, the peculiar logic of the Internet investor
takes no apparent note of such details, and Real Network speeds off
in the fast lane while Cnet eats its dust.

<P>
   GANDA SINGHWALA, Pakistan _ The rains came on Sunday to this
parched Punjabi village, pelting the shiny black hides of water
buffalo and the barefoot boys who joyously stretched out their arms
to welcome the drenching coolness.
</P>
<P>
   But the gaiety with which the villagers greeted the monsoon
contrasted with their grim fatalism about the fighting that has
raged for two months between Pakistan and India in Kashmir, the
Himalayan land just to the north of Punjab that both nations want
for their own.
</P>
<P>
   History lies heavy in Ganda Singhwala, two to three miles from
the Indian border. Here the distrust of Pakistanis for Indians, of
Muslims for Hindus, is as raw as a fresh stab wound.
</P>
<P>
   The old men, toothless and stooped, tell and retell grisly
stories of Partition in 1947, when India and Pakistan were carved
from the British empire, and Hindus and Sikhs on the one hand and
Muslims on the other slaughtered each other by the hundreds of
thousands. Punjab, too, was divided, into Indian and Pakistani
states.
</P>
<P>
   Khushi Muhammad, 94, has raised children and grandchildren on
his bitter memories. A Muslim, he fled predominantly Hindu India
for the new Islamic nation of Pakistan and recalls the caravans of
ox carts that passed through his new hometown, stacked with the
dead bodies of Muslim men, women and children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot forget it,'' he said, hands resting on a wood cane.
``This fire can never be extinguished.''
</P>
<P>
   The next generation has its own harsh memories of the wars that
these closest of enemies waged in 1965 and 1971, with fighting
along the border that moved perilously close to this village.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the heavy shelling and bombing started in 1965, we had to
leave,'' said Nazir Begum, 60, who is married to a shopkeeper who
repairs bicycles. ``I am fearful there will be another war. But I
pray Allah will be with the Pakistan army.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Ganda Singhwala seems ordinary in most every way, these
are not ordinary times. Situated so close to the Indian border, it
was crawling with men who work for civilian and military
intelligence agencies. Some carried Kalashnikov rifles. Others had
walkie-talkies. More than 12 tramped along behind visitors,
monitoring the questions asked and answers given.
</P>
<P>
   This region is unusual in another way. An embankment studded
with concrete bunkers runs along the Pakistani side of the border,
and is matched by a floodlighted fence on the Indian side. The
bunkers serve as a Berlin wall between the two countries. The
people on each side live parallel lives that do not intersect.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite having been cut off from each other for more than 50
years, Ganda Singhwala bears a haunting resemblance to most any
northern Indian village.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, after the rains stopped and 110-degree heat
rose again from the labyrinthine brick lanes, men dressed in loose
tunics and undershirts gathered on wood cots to pass the time.
Ox-drawn carts rolled down the rutted muddy main street. In small
internal courtyards, women hospitably poured cups of tea for
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   People described themselves as having almost nothing in common
with Indians. ``We are Muslims, so there's a big difference between
the two cultures,'' said Muhammad's granddaughter Riffat Yasin, 22.
``We worship only one God. They have several idols, and they call
them gods.''
</P>
<P>
   Each day, Miss Yasin and her mother, Nasreen, who has just one
name, turn on their aging television set with the broken knobs to
watch the news on Doordarshan, the Indian government station.
``It's all fabricated,'' Miss Yasin said.
</P>
<P>
   They and other villagers offered the official Pakistani version
of events as their description of reality. They said the men who
were fighting in majority Muslim Kashmir were not Pakistan army
soldiers who had invaded Indian territory, as the Indians contend,
but indigenous freedom fighters who are trying to win Kashmir's
right to be part of Pakistan, created as a homeland for the
subcontinent's Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Nasreen, who estimated that she was 45, said she believed that
Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee of India wanted to win a war
with Pakistan to help his party win the national election in
September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pakistan wants peace,'' Nasreen said. ``It is India that wants
war.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of miles away, near the border, several farmers sat in
the shade on their cots, musing on India's motives. They said they
felt that a grave injustice was committed at the time of partition,
when Kashmir should have become part of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kashmir belongs to the Muslims,'' said Sardar Said Muhammad,
65, who owns 400 acres of fertile land and 50 head of water
buffalo. ``The Hindus have nothing at stake there.''
</P>
<P>
   The farmers had more recent grievances, as well. They said
Indians had sneaked through the gates of the fence that India built
along the border to steal hundreds of their water buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad and another farmer, Muhammad Ali, 60, agreed that the
Indians were up to no good.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hindu mentality is that no single Muslim should survive
and all of Kashmir should be captured by India,'' Muhammad said.
``The Hindus and Americans are on the same side. They are
supporting each other, because they are both big powers.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali offered his opinion about India, saying: ``They're powerful.
They're bullying. They have a greed for territory. They don't want
Pakistan to exist. They want to obliterate us.''

A MILOSEVIC FIELD OF DREAMS: BAMBIPARK  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BLAINE HARDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   POZAREVAC, Yugoslavia _ Neither war against the Western world,
nor missiles in his father's house, nor scurrilous rumors that he
skipped the country to avoid fighting in Kosovo have kept President
Slobodan Milosevic's only son, Marko, from realizing his theme park
dream.
</P>
<P>
   The dream goes by the name of Bambiland.
</P>
<P>
   At least that was the original name chosen by Marko, a high
school dropout who has become Serbia's best connected and perhaps
least loved 25-year-old entrepreneur playboy.
</P>
<P>
   The pounding that Serbia took during the Kosovo war from
American bombs _ his father's presidential mansion in Belgrade was
hit by cruise missiles _ soured Marko on the Disneyesque
connotations of ``Bambiland.'' At some point during the 11-week
war, he reportedly decided that the name did not sound sufficiently
Serbian.
</P>
<P>
   So when the park, actually more of a sports area, had its grand
opening on Sunday night _ with Marko's mother, Mirjana Markovic,
the feared wife of the Yugoslav president, in attendance along with
a crowd of several thousand _ it was christened Bambipark.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition newspapers have pointed out that ``park'' is no more
Serbian than ``land.''
</P>
<P>
   The name Bambi is another matter. Although it does echo the
beloved Disney film of the same name, it has a Serbian link. Bambi
is the name of a large government-owned food processing company
based here in Pozarevac, the childhood home of both of Marko's
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Bambipark is a six-acre recreation area, costing about $380,000,
for basketball, volleyball, skateboarding and in-line skating. It
costs about 70 cents to get in.
</P>
<P>
   Marko was offered a chance Monday to explain the business
venture to a reporter. Dressed in a black T-shirt and black slacks
and talking intermittently on a tiny cellular phone, he happened to
be sitting inside Bambipark at the noon hour beside a kiddy pool
and beneath a Coca-Cola umbrella. He was drinking juice and did not
seem in a particular rush.
</P>
<P>
   But meeting the press is not a simple matter for Marko.
Newspapers and magazines in Serbia have often teased him for his
habit of wrecking other people's expensive cars, for dying his
black hair a punk white, for occasionally bullying people in bars
in Belgrade and for having used daddy's connections to become rich.
</P>
<P>
   He owns Madona, which advertises itself as the largest
discotheque in the Balkans. American intelligence officials say he
is a major cigarette smuggler. He also owns a radio station
licensed to him by his father's government.
</P>
<P>
   He has found ways of getting even with hurtful reporters. He
sued an opposition newspaper in Belgrade for making fun of him,
using draconian press laws passed last year. In January a court
ordered the newspaper to pay him $15,000 for ``inflicted moral
damage.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the question of whether he evaded risky military service
in Kosovo, a matter that generated many disparaging comments among
Serbs who had to fight, the young Milosevic was defended by his
mother.
</P>
<P>
   She wrote an open letter to the British foreign secretary, Robin
Cook, denying press reports that Marko or her daughter Marija had
fled the country during the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Marko, she said, ``is in uniform and cares about his small new
family.'' The state television later showed Marko here in Pozarevac
in a sort of military uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the war, Marko has told sympathetic newspapers
and the state television that he never let anxiety about NATO
bombing interfere with the construction of Bambipark. It
represents, he told reporters, ``the proof of care for the young
generation.''
</P>
<P>
   As a break from the rigors of supervising the building of
Bambipark, he also became deputy chairman of the horse show
organizing board in the Serbian town of Ljubicevo. He has changed
the opening ceremony of the horse show to make it less
``stereotyped,'' Radio Pozarevac reported.
</P>
<P>
   As he sat drinking his juice near the kiddy pool, the evidence
of what he and other investors have accomplished with Bambipark was
all around him, though there were only a few children playing
there, since it was uncomfortably hot at noon.
</P>
<P>
   Marko was asked if he would like to explain why he felt the need
to build this place. ``You are the aggressor,'' he replied. ``You
burned down my house, and I am not going to speak with you or give
you any interview, even about Bambipark.''

TESTING TIME FOR NTT'S GLOBAL AMBITIONS

 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Junichiro Miyazu heads Asia's biggest company, Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone Corp., and he is about to make it even
bigger.
</P>
<P>
   A serious, owlish man, Miyazu intends to use a new law to
transform Japan's telecommunications giant into a global player to
battle with the likes of AT&AMP;T. The new law, which took effect July
1 after a decade of dithering in Japan's Parliament, reshapes NTT
and permits it for the first time to compete directly overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may fail from time to time, but we ought to explore as many
new businesses as we can,'' Miyazu, the president of NTT, said in
an interview. ``Great changes are now taking place in the world of
information and communications, such as the Internet and
multimedia, and NTT won't be able to survive just on what it has
done in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   So NTT is setting up operations around the world, and taking
stakes in companies that provide services related to the Internet
and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   In April, it announced a collaboration with AT&AMP;T to provide
consulting services on networks to large companies. More recently,
it has been gobbling up investments in Asian telecommunications
carriers _ for example, a 15 percent stake in Philippine Long
Distance Telephone Co. and a stake in Sri Lanka Telecommunications.
It aims to become the dominant telecommunications company across
Asia, growing along with the world's most populous region.
</P>
<P>
   But many doubt that NTT's strategy will work, and for the
moment, NTT's plans are striking less for their business acumen
than for their obliviousness to market principles. NTT is
struggling to adjust to a new era of free markets, yet its business
plans still seem designed not by marketing executives but rather by
politicians and bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts had hoped that the new law would be a Japanese
parallel of the breakup of AT&AMP;T, but instead it confirmed NTT's
monopoly on local calls, retained its status as a semi-official
company and simply gave it the additional power to venture abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Thus critics say that the new law and NTT's restructuring
represent a major lost opportunity that will leave Japanese
telecommunications hobbled by a monopolist company that will never
compete effectively around the world. NTT is one of the world's
largest corporations, as measured by its stock market value of
roughly $186 billion, but the lumbering company has been widely
criticized for extremely expensive service in Japan, which has
slowed the emergence of Internet services. The critics say that
retaining the monopoly will just mean more of the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a step backward,'' said Yusai Okuyama, the
wiry and fiery chairman of DDI Corp., one of Japan's most
innovative telecommunications companies. If there is no fair
competition, he said, DDI ``will be worse than negligible; under
those circumstances, we will never be able to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Okuyama and other rivals worry that with NTT's continuing
monopoly in the local telephone business, long distance and
international carriers will still be beholden to NTT because they
must connect to its local and highly expensive network.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is as openly critical, but many argue that after
all these years Japan's restructuring of telecommunications is
feeble at best.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's their first baby step toward globalization,'' said
Timothy Wiest, president of Primus Telecommunications in Japan.
``It's not that the rest of the world is shaking in their boots.
It's that the rest of Japan can see that the monopolist is moving
to monopolize international business from Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last couple of years, the small carriers have been
jostling to join up with partners to insure their market toeholds,
however tiny. The reorganization, they fear, will now give NTT the
chance to snatch away their painstakingly groomed business.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, NTT Communications, the new subsidiary that will
shape the long distance and global business, has ambitious plans to
mimic an American-style approach. It wants to outfit Japan's giant
conglomerates with tailored telecommunications networks and
services in high-speed data transmission, multimedia and the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, NTT can go to Japan's large conglomerates, like
Mitsubishi Corp., and say that NTT can now offer one-stop
telecommunications shopping, so that that there is no need to buy
long distance and international service from competitors like DDI,
KDD or Japan Telecom Co.
</P>
<P>
   Okuyama said he is convinced that DDI, which operates in the
markets for long distance, international and mobile phones, must
find a foreign partner by the end of this year to compete. But he
also insisted that DDI has some advantages NTT lacks, namely
agility and speed.
</P>
<P>
   With 60 million subscribers in Japan and 138,200 employees, NTT
is run more like a bureaucracy than probably any other Japanese
company, and it answers to a national law that governs its
operations. Even Miyazu acknowledges the challenges, and said there
are no plans to move aggressively into the North American market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not that arrogant to hope that NTT will become a
household name in the United States,'' Miyazu said.
</P>
<P>
   The ministry of finance owns 59.2 percent of NTT, and
bureaucrats have shaped the company. From the telegraph to the
telephone, Japanese have grown up knowing only NTT, but over the
years the smaller players have nibbled at the fringes of NTT's
domain, such as in city-to-city calls.
</P>
<P>
   NTT is spreading overseas just as foreign carriers are banging
at the doors to get into Japan. Just weeks ago, Cable and Wireless
of Britain won a battle against NTT to buy a tiny local
international carrier, International Digital Communications, in
which it already had a minority stake.
</P>
<P>
   But NTT seems to be picking its fights. International Digital,
which had patiently negotiated standard telephone lines with over
200 countries, had close ties to NTT, but some executives say it
did not exactly fit in with NTT's international strategy. Instead,
they say, NTT Communications wants to concentrate on providing big
Japanese multinationals with customized telecommunications
networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to secure our market in Japan and in Asia,'' said
Tatsuo Kawasaki, vice president of global strategy at NTT
Communications. ``Otherwise, global players like AT&AMP;T and Deutsche
Telekom will move into the Japanese market. And that means we would
lose our cash cows.''

INVESTORS DON'T LIKE THE NUMBERS ON 3M'S POST-IT NOTE

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL, Minn. _ Here at the technology center of the Minnesota
Mining and Manufacturing Corp., scientists are tinkering with
stickier adhesives, longer-lasting abrasives, glare-free reflective
signs _ indeed, with improvements on virtually every product, from
the esoteric to the mundane, that 3M makes.
</P>
<P>
   The road to product nirvana, the scientists say, is a hot new
technology called microreplication, a way to place thousands of
identical microscopic shapes on the surfaces of all kinds of
materials, from sandpaper to flat-panel computer screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microreplication is reinventing our core businesses,'' said
Robert S. Finocchiaro, who runs the microreplication project.
</P>
<P>
   But the mood is a bit more somber across the street, where the
corporate types are. Try as they will, they cannot shake Wall
Street's perception of 3M as a boring, low-technology drone whose
glory days ended with Scotch tape and Post-it notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put it next to a machinery company, and the stock
performance looks the same,'' said B. Alexander Henderson, who
follows 3M for Prudential Securities Research.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not just image, though; it is performance. For
two years, 3M has consistently missed earnings estimates, and its
revenues, half of them from foreign shores, have been stuck at $15
billion. Its shares, which sold near $100 in July 1997, drifted to
$70 by April. The stock has rebounded some, closing at $86.9375 on
Friday, but many 3M watchers say the rise comes from investor
disaffection with Internet stocks and hopes for an Asian economic
recovery, not from confidence in 3M's management.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just don't have the killer instinct when it comes to
financial returns,'' said Jack L. Kelly, who follows 3M for
Goldman, Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   Is 3M, once a darling of Wall Street, now just another badly
managed also-ran? Or is it still a new-product machine that had a
bad case of the hiccups last year?
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the company have accused Livio D. DeSimone, 3M's
chairman since 1991, of everything from losing 3M's innovative
touch to refusing to cut costs to mismanaging inventories to
sticking with humdrum products too long. Some have even put
pressure on the board to ask DeSimone, who turns 63 this month, to
step down before the mandatory retirement age of 65.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows an incredible amount about product, but he just
doesn't have a good enough grip on daily operations,'' one analyst
said.
</P>
<P>
   DeSimone _ widely known as Desi, a variation on the start of his
last name _ tries to take the criticism in stride, but it clearly
annoys him. He says he is cutting costs, tightening procedures and
getting products to markets faster.
</P>
<P>
   Although DeSimone, a chemical engineer who has been with 3M for
32 years, concedes that maybe he should have bitten those bullets
sooner, he maintains that more of 3M's fiscal woes can be traced to
the strong dollar and the weak Asian economies than to his
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I became dumb all of a sudden in 1998,'' he said. ``Well, no
one thought I was dumb in 1997, and hopefully, I'll be seen as
smart again in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors aren't so easily persuaded. ``The U.S. still accounts
for half of revenues, too, and the economy here isn't bad,'' said
one portfolio manager.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly of Goldman, Sachs said, ``Too often, they try to sweep
everything under the convenient rug of currency problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The company does have fans. Perkin-Elmer, the life-sciences
concern now known as the PE Corp., chose 3M in February as a joint
venture partner for genetic analysis. Robert Sprague, a manager at
the Xerox Corp., cites 3M's extensive manufacturing experience as
the reason Xerox picked 3M to manufacture its ``electronic paper''
_ reusable rubbery sheets embedded with billions of tiny
electrically charged balls that can be written on with an
electronic wand.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he feels the stock is fully valued, Jonathan
Rosenzweig, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, said of 3M,
``They have a knack for taking something that exists, changing it a
bit and leveraging it into an entirely new product.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, trying to categorize 3M at all is an exercise in
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1902 to mine corundum, an abrasive mineral, the
company quickly shifted to processing the leftover grit into
sandpaper and grinding wheels. Over the years it branched out into
industries as unrelated as thermofaxing, the copying method that
preceded xerography, and adhesives. It has pulled out of many
businesses, including copiers and a bank it once owned, but it
still makes 50,000 products, ranging from optical fibers to wound
dressings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, 3M is not a classic conglomerate, one that could easily
be broken up. Its 40 divisions are as technologically intertwined
as an arterial network. ``People who ask how dressings mesh with
adhesives don't realize that both are sticky,'' DeSimone said.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Jones lists 3M under diversified technology, while the Value
Line Investment newsletter groups it with diversified chemicals.
Jeffrey J. Zekauskas, a chemical analyst with Schroder &AMP; Co., said,
``3M technologies, especially in electronics, are relevant to the
analysis of specialty chemical companies.'' Still, no chemical
analyst covers 3M.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it is watched by the same people who track Xerox, Kodak
and other image and document processing companies _ a business 3M
left when it spun off Imation a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   DeSimone would like 3M, which pumps 6 percent of revenues into
research _ higher than most industrial companies _ to be described
an innovator, pure and simple. ``We're a specialty materials
company that takes related technologies into seemingly unrelated
end-products,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Microreplication may be the premier example. It involves placing
identical three-dimensional structures on a surface, changing how
that surface reflects light, wears down or otherwise acts
differently from the undoctored version.
</P>
<P>
   For example, old-style abrasive belts for metalworking must be
replaced as soon as the abrasive surface is worn away. 3M now uses
microreplication to pile cutting surfaces on top of one another, so
that when the top surface is worn down, a fresh cutting surface
emerges. The company says its new belts, sold under the name
Trizact, last up to five times as long as older products.
</P>
<P>
   Innovation is nothing new at 3M. It was here that Post-it notes
were born when one employee, frustrated at losing the strips he
used to mark text in his church hymnal, enlisted the aid of
another, who was trying to develop a seemingly oxymoronic product,
a nonbinding adhesive.
</P>
<P>
   Innovation has not been limited to products. 3M was one of the
first companies to install a dual-career ladder, a now-popular
method for promoting researchers without forcing them out of their
labs into management. (Some 3M scientists complain they are still
paid less than their management counterparts; 3M says the
complaints are baseless.)
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are allowed to devote 15 percent of their time to
projects that pique their interest, even those on which management
has pulled the plug. That has caused some analysts to criticize 3M
for undisciplined management, but DeSimone defends the practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to encourage innovation, you have to close your
eyes when people are so excited about a project that they refuse to
stop,'' he said, noting that Thinsulate, a big-selling clothing
insulation material, resulted from a project he had officially
scuttled.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   When researchers do come up with something promising, they are
encouraged to shop it around to all the businesses. A
pharmaceuticals researcher invented a dosage dispenser that mixes
two drugs together; the adhesives division adapted it to mix pastes
that dry as they are applied. A non-heat-generating lighting system
developed in Japan, primarily for use in supermarket coolers, is
selling well for architectural lighting in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers hold an annual event, patterned on a trade show but
open only to 3M people, where they run booths displaying their
latest inventions.
</P>
<P>
   The automotive division picked up a new way to make headlights
when some adhesive researchers displayed a multilayer film. ``Many
of the `Eurekas!' at 3M come from this forum,'' said William E.
Coyne, senior vice president for research.
</P>
<P>
   By some measurements, 3M's innovation formula has been wildly
successful. The company received 611 patents last year, the 11th
most of any American company. Management has long insisted that 3M
derive one-third of revenues from products that are no more than
four years old, and 10 percent from products that are new each
year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, innovation could not protect 3M's financial results last
year. Its revenues dipped to $15.02 billion from $15.07 billion in
1997. Operating income fared even worse, dropping to $2.04 billion
from $2.68 billion. Net income and per-share earnings were
practically halved _ $1.18 billion, or 2.88 a diluted share, in
1998, down from $2.12 billion, or $5.06 a share, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the dollar is strengthening against every currency,
geographic diversity is a burden as well as a strength,'' said
Ronald O. Baukol, 3M's executive vice president in charge of
international operations.
</P>
<P>
   DeSimone has tried hard to shore up the numbers. Last year _
much too late, some analysts say _ he promised to cut 4,500 jobs by
the end of 1999, bringing total employment down to 71,500. He sold
some small businesses and closed some factories overseas. Now, he
is trying to set up the remaining factories to make a greater
variety of products, so that 3M can more easily shift production to
countries with favorable currency exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, he has introduced a program, called
Pacing Plus, to single out research projects with the potential to
yield huge revenues _ to ``change the nature of competition,'' as
3M puts it _ and speed them to market. Products from this program,
like parts for inkjet printer cartridges and environmentally safe
fluids for cleaning electronic components, accounted for $1 billion
in revenue last year, and Coyne predicted that a third of 3M's
revenues would come from such projects _ probably most employing
some form of microreplication _ by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've spent too much time on products that provide
incremental, not significant, growth,'' Coyne said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, 3M is taking pains to see that smaller projects are not
eclipsed. Its three-year-old Corporate Enterprise Department
finances technologies, like a technique for time-releasing insect
pheromones that might one day be used in pesticides, that no
division is ready to take to market.
</P>
<P>
   The company is even licensing innovations it cannot immediately
use _ an unusual move for the generally secretive company. It
licensed a method for making flexible printing plates to DuPont and
it is looking for a licensee for a process for making glass panels
for flat-screen televisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago we would have made the panels ourselves, but now we
realize it's silly to go into glass manufacturing,'' Finocchiaro
said.
</P>
<P>
   Will 3M, once a regular on lists of most admired companies,
regain its Wall Street sheen?
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say that it is finally on the right track. But
skeptics still outnumber converts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, 3M has changed,'' Henderson of Prudential said, summing
up the prevailing Wall Street view. ``But the question remains: has
it changed enough?''

   NEW YORK _ Gwyneth Paltrow has been seen around town wearing
flip-flops, giving an imprimatur of sorts to bare flat sandals for
the city. Most people will probably reserve them for the beach or
country, but, hey, there are no rules anymore. Even men have taken
to wearing sandals, though of a sturdier style, with their city
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Barneys New York has men's sandals with crossover fronts, by Miu
Miu ($235), and with slides, by Costume National ($210) and Tsubo
($95).
</P>
<P>
   The store's women's flat sandals include ankle ties, by
Freelance ($160) and Jutta Neumann ($210), and thongs, by Farrutx
($130 to $150), Rose's Roses ($195) and Freelance ($125).
</P>
<P>
   Flat thong sandals for women at Saks Fifth Avenue include one by
Studio Via Spiga ($88), a braided style by Salvatore Ferragamo
($175), one with braided gold cord by Yves Saint Laurent ($190),
and two costly whimsies by Gucci: with Indian beadwork ($460) and
with turquoise feathers ($350).

Steffi Graf, running two-thirds the length of a broadsheet page.
Pete Sampras has been reduced to a small, one-column head shot,
along with the last few paragraphs of the accompanying story.
</P>
<P>
   Graf, the respected seven-time champion, bowed out after losing
the final on Sunday to Lindsay Davenport. The only man who would
have upstaged Graf was Tim Henman, England's own. He lost his
semifinal to Sampras, who then dominated Andre Agassi for a sixth
Wimbledon title, the modern men's record. But while Sampras oiled
his cannon serve in the first set, Graf was somberly saying she
wouldn't be back. So right until the very end, women drove the
Wimbledon news.
</P>
<P>
   They have been the sport's fascination for a couple of years.
Wimbledon is to tennis what the Kentucky Derby is to horse racing,
commanding attention that is not reflective of the sport's
diminished popularity, especially in the States. But throughout the
year, the men have become accustomed to being the last paragraph or
two of those wire service reports out of tour stops like Key
Biscayne and Indian Wells. ``And in men's semifinal action ... ''
begins the afterthought, week after week.
</P>
<P>
   The women have the young comers, the fading icons, the
developing rivalries, and something else that seduces and becomes
irresistible to the sports news media. Unlike the strong, silent,
ground-stroking men, the teen-age girls burst on the scene
accompanied by that peculiar sports species, the professional
tennis parent. The kids come wearing family dysfunction on their
sleeves, like another endorsement patch.
</P>
<P>
   At this Wimbledon came the emergence of a fresh batch of teens
whose parents have managed to make as much news as they. Alexandra
Stevenson, Jelena Dokic and Mirjana Lucic were announced to the
world as part phenomenon, part social-work study. Mom said this.
Dad did what?
</P>
<P>
   As great a player as Graf has been, until her father made a mess
of her financial life and landed in jail, she was more appreciated
than celebrated. The standard by which we define marketability or
basic appeal has become warped. The parents seem to know that
outrageous behavior will help their kids get noticed. In her finest
hour Sunday, Davenport felt compelled to practically apologize for
being ``normal.''
</P>
<P>
   At Wimbledon, the subject of equal pay arose again, sponsored by
that former chauvinist, John McEnroe. Having once declared women
unworthy of announcing televised men's matches, McEnroe now argues
that women get more attention, so they should be paid as much. It
is a fair point, albeit one that is countered by the cyclical
nature of popularity and that the men play best-of-five sets, the
women two of three.
</P>
<P>
   The far more important issue as women's sports proliferate as
never before is how female athletes are viewed through the looking
glass of institutions that have forever been run by men, for the
benefit of men. Forget equal pay. For a week, I have been unable
able to find a single word in the London papers on the Women's
World Cup. I know England isn't represented, but they tell me this
is the Mecca of soccer. What gives?
</P>
<P>
   It is obviously much better for female athletes in the States
than England, or elsewhere, but our attitudes are still generally
shaped by those who believe that a women's sports story needs some
spicing up, a good knee whacking, or some dressing up, as the NBA
demonstrated with its grand opening idea of selling a women's
league by dolling up a few stars, a la Cindy Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   Most women I know in the sports news media are all too familiar
with these preconceived notions, with stereotyping, with resistance
to the notion that the forces of change can't be stopped. Football
stadiums are filled for the Women's World Cup, for a team of
mature, ``normal'' women, but try raising the subject with your
snickering drive-time host. It's only about ratings, he'll tell
you. Sure it is.
</P>
<P>
   When men want to look hard enough, there will always be a way to
define women as everything but what they wish to be. Samantha
Stevenson, mother of Alexandra, has courageously raised a
well-rounded daughter under very difficult circumstances, but
there's also a cautionary element to her tale: she is a female
sports journalist who had a relationship with a superstar athlete
she covered.
</P>
<P>
   What will those who campaign for the exclusion of women from the
locker room do with that bit of news? Charlie Ward may be
discussing it with Reggie White right now.

   A second day of 100-degree temperatures from the Carolinas to
New England turned the holiday Monday into a torturous test of
endurance and ingenuity, with thousands of relief-seekers fleeing
beaches that scorched their feet, only to find that some highways
had buckled in summer's ferocity.
</P>
<P>
   Temperature records for July 5 withered from Washington, where
it was 102, to Portland, Maine, which recorded a balmy 94. New York
City and Atlantic City set records at 101 degrees, Bridgeport,
Conn., hit 100 and Philadelphia tied its record at 100.
</P>
<P>
   But parks officials up and down the East Coast said beaches were
emptier than expected, as visitors moved their chairs and blankets
closer and closer to the water's edge, then finally gave up and
left for the air-conditioned comfort of the great indoors.
</P>
<P>
   The usual traffic nightmare for vacationers leaving the Hamptons
on Long Island became hours worse than usual when part of the
Sunrise Highway, the main route out, buckled in the heat, shutting
lanes for hours.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, the heat got so bad that recreation officials
at Hamilton Park on the Lower East Side of Manhattan had to ration
pool time to 15 minute shifts for some 500 youngster.
</P>
<P>
   But it could have been worse. At least pool employees sprayed
the melting masses with rubber hoses.
</P>
<P>
   But for the elderly and homebound, the heat posed serious
problems. The Emergency Medical Service answered 124 heat-related
calls, up from 53 on Sunday, and several were for life-threatening
cases of heat stroke, in which a patient's body temperature reaches
105 degrees. Paramedics plunged many of these patients into
bathtubs and poured ice or cold water on them to bring their body
temperatures down.
</P>
<P>
   City officials were urging caution and common sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get people to go to the movies, go to the
mall, go to a store _ anything,'' said Zachary Goldfarb, a deputy
fire chief.
</P>
<P>
   But for those who remained outside to enjoy the last few hours
of the long holiday weekend, the plan was simple: find a breath of
fresh air and do not move.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Perry, 49, a laborer, said it was too expensive to run the
air-conditioner 24 hours a day, so he found some tree-lined shelter
on a bench in Manhattan's Riverside Park. ``AC is OK, but it
doesn't beat coming out and finding a shady spot in Mother Nature.
This is it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sea Bright, N.J., Gina Melson, wearing a bikini and dialing a
cell-phone, gladly took advantage of the shore town's ordinance
allowing local vendors to deliver to their wares to the smoldering
legions on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to go pick lunch up,'' said Ms. Melson, 36, a medical
biller. ``But they'' _ she pointed at her sunbathing friends _
``they said: `Are you crazy? Why walk when you can phone?'''
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters said the oppressive weather could last through
Tuesday night, when a cold front slogging its way up the coast from
the Carolinas will finally accomplish what no amount of ice or
air-conditioning was able to over this blistering Fourth of July
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``One more day,'' said Edward Yandrich, a meteorologist for the
National Weather Service. ``I'm not even going to list the top 10
things you do in weather like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Yandrich's reticence, many city dwellers had no problems
carping about a day on which subway platforms transmogrified into
people-packed convection ovens and the sibilant whizz of soda cans
being popped open could be heard on any given street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine standing in a sauna with a fireplace, and the fire is
roaring, and you're doing jumping jacks _ in a mink coat,'' said
Doug Szabo, 26, an investment banker, who was lugging a new
air-conditioner toward his home on the Upper West Side of
Manhattan. ``Well, it's about 10 degrees hotter than that.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, D.C., even scoops of ice cream were not enough to
spell relief. ``It's too hot to go out and get ice cream,'' sighed
Rod Long, manager of a Baskin-Robbins store on Connecticut Avenue.
``We've only had 140 customers since 11 a.m.'' _ about half his
normal load.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday morning and into Monday, the same weather conditions
spawned violent thunderstorms in upstate New York and Massachusetts
as cold fronts from Michigan and Canada tangled with the outskirts
of the warmer regional air, said Jeff Warner, a meteorologist from
Pennsylvania State University.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of customers in upstate New York and in the city lost
power as power lines went down in some areas and an armada of
air-conditioners and electric fans clicked into use in others,
utility officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was horrendous,'' sniffed Ron Rubinow, 68, who spent a
toasty weekend with his sister in East Hampton. ``All the food's
gone bad. I couldn't get the electric garage door open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me just say this: It isn't good,'' he said.

A COSTLY COLLISION FOR 3 AT THE TOUR DE FRANCE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Italy, Australia, Estonia, Switzerland, The Netherlands,
Belgium, Texas)  By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. NAZAIRE, France _ What was expected to be a humdrum flat
stage in the Tour de France, just another showcase for the
sprinters, instead turned into a catastrophe for three major
contenders Monday, all of them losing more than six minutes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They were Alex Zulle, a Swiss with the Banesto team; Ivan Gotti,
an Italian with Polti, and Michael Boogerd, a Dutchman with
Rabobank. All were victims of a crash on a narrow and wet causeway
across a bay and could never catch up with a group of 70 riders who
made the crossing safely.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame that the Tour has to be played out that way,''
said Zulle, who has finished as high as second in the race.
</P>
<P>
   In a more expected loss, Lance Armstrong of the U.S. Postal
Service team gave up the overall leader's yellow jersey to Jaan
Kirsipuu, an Estonian with Casino. Kirsipuu, the winner on Sunday
of the first of 20 daily stages, made up his 16-second deficit on
the Texan by winning three intermediate sprints and then finishing
second across the line in the shipyard city of St. Nazaire.
</P>
<P>
   With 6 seconds deducted from his overall time at each sprint and
12 seconds for his finish, Kirsipuu now leads Armstrong, in second
place, by 14 seconds. Stuart O'Grady, an Australian with Credit
Agricole, is third, 22 seconds back.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong had hoped to keep the jersey for one more day but
admitted that the cost of defending it was wearing, emotionally and
physically, on his teammates. They have had to work hard to chase
down rivals on breakaways and to stay in high alertness throughout
the day.
</P>
<P>
   The Texan said his team tried to have George Hincapie, another
American, win the sprints and deprive Kirsipuu of the bonuses,
``but he's just too fast right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Hincapie was third in two of the three sprints and O'Grady, who
also has yellow-jersey ambitions before the race reaches the
mountains in a week, was second three times, gaining four seconds
on each occasion.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, it was the sprinters' finish everybody
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Steels, a Belgian with Mapei and the winner of four Tour
stages last year, outsped Kirsipuu and Mario Cipollini, an Italian
with Saeco and the usual king of the sprinters. Steels was timed in
3 hours 45 minutes 32 seconds, a speed of 29 miles an hour over the
109 miles from Challans.
</P>
<P>
   That speed, stoked by the U.S. Postal Service and other teams
with yellow-jersey dreams when the race ends in Paris on July 25,
left behind the part of the 180-man pack that was either involved
in or trapped behind the crash on the causeway at around Mile 50. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Known as the Passage du Gois, the two-lane crossing is under
Atlantic waters for all but six hours daily, before and after low
tide, in good weather, like today's overcast and sprinkly
conditions. In bad weather, it lies so low in the water that is
crossable only at dead low tide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the passage,'' said Armstrong, who was in the Tour in
1993 when the road was last used. ``But it was just crazy. The
slightest wheel movement and you were sliding.''
</P>
<P>
   The pack entered the 2.4-mile causeway in a long parade that was
watched by hundreds of spectators standing barefooted on mud flats
where others were gathering shellfish, cockles and mussels. Barely
a mile in, a dozen riders near the midpoint of the pack began
falling and there was no way around them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was well placed,'' said Zulle, who has a
reputation for being ill placed. ``But I was stopped. Once I got
started again I could see the big group in front but I couldn't
make it across to them.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason was that the contenders in the front group, including
Armstrong, Abraham Olano of ONCE, Pavel Tonkov of Mapei and Bobby
Julich of Cofidis, realized that they had a chance to leave some
formidable rivals far behind and spurred their teammates into
hyperspeed.
</P>
<P>
   Some 25 miles later, what had been perhaps a 20-second gap had
grown to two minutes. And 35 miles after that, at the finish, it
was 6:03. The chasers must have lost heart, with Zulle, Boogerd and
Gotti knowing that their hopes had curdled.
</P>
<P>
   Zulle, one of the Festina Six who confessed to the use of
illegal drugs after the nine-man team was expelled from last year's
Tour, now trails by 6:24. Gotti, the winner of the Giro d'Italia
last month, is 7:04 behind and Boogerd, fifth in the last Tour and
the winner of the Paris-Nice race in March, is 7:19 behind. Gotti's
teammate, Richard Virenque, the controversial French star, was in
the front group, 1:05 behind.

ANALYSIS: IN MEXICO, RULING PARTY AND OPPOSITION BOTH MAKE A
POINT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ For years now, opposition politicians have argued
that the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which by hook or crook
has won every presidential election since the 1920s, could not win
another one if the race were even halfway fair and open.
</P>
<P>
   After a comfortable victory by the party, known as the PRI, in
elections Sunday for governor of the state of Mexico, Mexico's most
populous state with 7.1 million registered voters, those
politicians have been proved wrong.
</P>
<P>
   With a full-bore mobilization of its political machine, the PRI
managed to carry Arturo Montiel Rojas, 55, a candidate described
even by his own party as undistinguished and inarticulate, to the
governorship. Final results of the first official count showed that
Montiel took 40.7 percent of the vote, while the closest contender,
Jose Luis Duran Reveles of the National Action Party, or PAN, took
34.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A third candidate, Higinio Martinez Miranda, 43, of the Party of
the Democratic Revolution, polled 21.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The results removed any doubt that the presidential election to
be held on July 2, 2000, will be a real contest. Thanks to often
hard-fought reforms since the last national vote, in 1994,
President Ernesto Zedillo and the opposition have created a
relatively solid democratic framework for the balloting. Now the
PRI has shown that even under the new rules it can win once again.
</P>
<P>
   But so could the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time that the two major opposition parties were
going down in defeat in the state of Mexico, an unlikely 11th-hour
opposition coalition of four parties, including the PAN and the
Party of the Democratic Revolution, snatched the governor's post
from the PRI in the small western coastal state of Nayarit.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition candidate, Antonio Echevarria, 55, won with 51.7
percent of the vote. The PRI candidate, Jose Lucas Vallarta Robles,
67, took 42.8 percent, a strong showing that would have allowed him
to win easily if the opposition had been divided.
</P>
<P>
   The day's results sent an unmistakable message that the
opposition could greatly improve its chances of taking national
power next year for the first time in seven decades by forming an
alliance behind a single candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But the case of the Nayarit coalition suggests little about
whether the opposition can forge an alliance at the national level.
In tiny Nayarit, a slow-living desert state with only 557,000
registered voters, the opposition had no strong candidates and
almost no following before this year. Its luck changed when
Echevarria, long the state PRI's richest and most savvy strongman
and fund-raiser, fell out with the governor, also from the PRI, and
bolted the party.
</P>
<P>
   Echevarria's political ideas, however, had little to do with his
success at uniting the opposition behind him. What counted was his
sheer pull at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about winning power for power's sake,'' said Joaquin
Lopez Doriga, a television commentator.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the two major opposition parties both have
strong-willed national leaders who are expected to become
presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Vicente Fox Quesada of Guanajuato, known for his tough
country-style talk and cowboy boots, will probably run for the PAN,
a Catholic, business-oriented party. Some recent polls are casting
him as the front-runner at this stage.
</P>
<P>
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano of the left-of-center Party of the
Democratic Revolution won the race for mayor of Mexico City in 1997
and is widely believed to have triumphed in the presidential vote
of 1988, losing it only by fraud.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine the scenario that would see one of them
stand graciously down in favor of the other.
</P>
<P>
   The vote in the state of Mexico, which borders Mexico City on
three sides, also showed a decline in the popularity of Cardenas'
party. It dropped 13 percentage points since the elections in July
1997, when Cardenas was chosen mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials argued that the choice of Martinez, who turned
out to be a colorless candidate, may have affected their showing as
much as dissatisfaction with Cardenas' performance.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI seemed to be using the state of Mexico elections to test
several of the limits it will face in the big race next year. The
party mounted an abrasive but convincing campaign against crime,
which has overwhelmed many cities in the state. Montiel called
criminals ``rats'' who did not deserve the protections of human
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the campaign, PRI party workers used a variety of
tactics to pressure voters or reward them for their vote, from a
massive drive to get photocopies of voter credentials to
election-day food hand-outs and outright payments to voters.
</P>
<P>
   Under both state and federal elections laws, these practices are
not illegal. ``Our problem is that vote-buying and coercion are
gray areas in the legislation,'' said Emilio Zebadua, a member of
the Federal Elections Council, which will oversee the presidential
contest.
</P>
<P>
   But if the results are close in the race for president, the
PRI's shenanigans could provoke an angry reaction from the
opposition. ``We will certainly see these tactics next year, and
they will stain the election,'' said Jose Antonio Crespo, an
elections analyst. ``And they could become a source of serious
conflict.''

SUSPECT IN SHOOTINGS LEFT MARK ON INDIANA COLLEGE TOWN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOOMINGTON, Ind. _ When a bust of Adolf Hitler was left on the
doorstep of a Jewish organization on Holocaust Remembrance Day this
year, there was little doubt around town who had delivered it.
</P>
<P>
   When well-tended lawns were repeatedly littered with pamphlets
advocating white supremacy, there was no mystery who had done the
leafleting.
</P>
<P>
   And when more than 500 people marched through downtown to oppose
hate speech, there was no question whose words they were opposing.
In fact, any uncertainty was erased when the one-man hate squad who
was the prime focus of the rally showed up in person to denounce
it.
</P>
<P>
   In little more than a year in Bloomington, Benjamin Nathaniel
Smith made a major impression _ almost universally negative _ on
this pleasant college town an hour south of Indianapolis. Before
moving back to his home state of Illinois seven weeks ago, Smith
spent his days here antagonizing religious, political, police, and
community leaders with what they called racist ravings. Nights and
weekends were given over to a loner's existence in an apartment
surrounded by black neighbors at whom he glared in stony silence.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 21, apparently killed himself late Sunday night while
being chased by police near Salem, Ill., 250 miles south of
Chicago. That ended a three-day, two-state shooting spree in which
authorities say he shot at nearly two dozen people _ all black,
Jewish or of Asian descent _ killing two and wounding nine.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Smith's assault began Friday night when he
wounded six Orthodox Jews as they left their northern Chicago
synagogue. Police said he then killed former Northwestern
University men's basketball coach Ricky Byrdsong, who is black,
while Byrdsong was walking with his children in Skokie, Ill., just
north of Chicago. That same night, police said, Smith also fired at
two Asian-Americans in nearby Northbrook; neither was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, two black men were fired upon and an Asian-American
man was injured in separate shootings in Springfield, Decatur, and
Urbana, Ill., authorities said. Smith was not charged in those
shootings but was considered the prime suspect before his death,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith then ended his bitter relationship with Bloomington on
Sunday by making it the last deadly stop on his apparent rampage.
That morning, Smith parked his light blue Ford Taurus outside the
Korean United Methodist Church of Bloomington and shot four times
into a crowd of worshipers as they were going to services, said
Police Chief Jim Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Two bullets hit Won Joon Yoon, 26, killing the Korean immigrant
who came to Bloomington to seek a doctoral degree at Indiana
University. It was July Fourth and witnessses told police they were
certain the gunshots were firecrackers until their friend fell to
the sidewalk, fatally wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The Taurus then sped out of town. Twelve hours later, Smith was
dead, still armed with the .22-caliber and .380-caliber handguns
police said matched the caliber of the guns used in the assaults.
Authorities said Monday they were tracing the source of the guns.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's end came after he carjacked a van at gunpoint at a rural
gas station in Marion County, Ill., said Sheriff Gerald L.
Benjamin. He said Smith apparently shot and wounded himself twice
as officers followed the van in a slow-speed chase. The van crashed
and Smith shot himself again while struggling with deputies,
Benjamin said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Smith left a trail of shock and mourning all along his
path, his actions reverberated particularly hard in Bloomington,
where Smith's white supremacist beliefs reached full flower after
his arrival in spring 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Smith came to this city of 67,000 to attend Indiana University
as a criminal justice major, reportedly after he was expelled or
suspended from the University of Illinois. At 6 feet tall and 135
pounds, Smith was a gangling young man whose most notable physical
features were a tattoo on his chest that said ``Sabbath Breaker''
and what acquaintances said was an ever-ready scowl.
</P>
<P>
   He also brought with him the teachings of the World Church of
the Creator, a white supremacist organization based in East Peoria,
Ill., to which Smith belonged until May. The organization, which is
run from the home of its leader, Matt Hale, advocates ``crowding''
what it calls ``mud races'' off the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Hale Monday were not answered, but in an interview with
Reuters he said Smith's actions may have been provoked by the fact
that Hale was denied membership to the Illinois state bar on
Friday. Hale, who said his goal was to defend white supremacists in
court, said he never encouraged Smith to use violence to further
their goals.
</P>
<P>
   The World Church's message was generally unwelcome in
Bloomington, where more than half the residents are university
students and where the police station is adorned with the words,
``Bloomington, A Safe and Civil City.''
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, Smith spent his first weeks in Bloomington putting
racist leaflets on cars at the university. That drew the attention
of Richard McKaig, the dean of students, who met with Smith on May
26, 1998, to discuss campus rules about posting leaflets. Smith
came with his own agenda, to complain about ``people harassing him
for exercising his free speech rights,'' McKaig said Monday. The
dean called it ``a businesslike discussion'' but noted that Smith's
``views about race were as bizarre as any I've ever heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith moved his efforts off-campus and, during Independence Day
weekend in 1998, he papered lawns and windshields with literature
from the World Church, alarming community leaders and attracting
the notice of police. He also came to the attention of groups that
track hate speech, including the Anti-Defamation League.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said his department's first contact with Smith came on
July 3, 1998, when a patrol car stopped him while he was
distributing fliers. Explaining his mission in an interview
published the next day in a student newspaper, Smith said: ``I
think it's pretty clear that our government has turned against
white people.'' It was a view he repeated in other public forums,
including radio call-in shows and letters to local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Smith never displayed violent tendencies and was
never charged with a crime in Bloomington. ``The only thing we
could have gotten him for was littering,'' Kennedy said. Smith did,
however, have a record of arrests in Illinois dating to 1995,
including resisting a peace officer.
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, Smith did the leafleting on his own and spent
most of his time in Bloomington by himself, though Kennedy said
police hope to speak with a woman who is believed to have helped
Smith distribute World Church literature. He said she is not a
suspect and that no one else is being sought in connection with the
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Though there was no evidence Smith attracted followers in
Bloomington, his leaflets were deeply troubling to political,
religious, and community leaders. They responded by forming an
organization called Bloomington United, whose purpose was to find a
community response to hate speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were dealing with a person who was trying to terrorize us
psychologically, and we came together in response,'' said Jeffrey
Willsey, a leader of the group and director of Bloomington's Safe
and Civil City Project.
</P>
<P>
   The group began its opposition to Smith with its own signs, some
of which can still be found on lawns: ``No hate speech. Not in our
yards, not in our town, not anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, last November, the group organized a march through
Bloomington to further denounce Smith. Mayor John Fernandez said in
an interview that he told the crowd: ``Our community must stand
together and reject messages of hate and division. We must find
strength in our differences.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor looked out over the crowd, and at the very front he
saw Smith, frowning and carrying a sign: ``No hate speech means no
free speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith next came to authorities' attention in April, when the
bust of Hitler was found at the Helene G. Simon Hillel Center at
Indiana University. Attached was a note: ``Happy Holocaust
Remembrance Day. Thanks to the man who made it all possible.''
Smith had been seen in the area of the center that same day, said
Rabbi Sue Shifron, the center's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no question in my mind it was from him,'' Shifron
said. ``It was very frightening, which of course was his intent.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Smith's activities made him well known among
Bloomington's most active and powerful residents, he was virtually
anonymous to his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   During his time in Bloomington, Smith lived in a small apartment
complex called Touchdown Terrace in the shadow of Indiana
University's football stadium. It was a $370-a-month apartment with
all the charm of a roadside motel room. It is now vacant and being
used by the complex as a model for prospective tenants.
</P>
<P>
   Black tenants live on both sides of Smith's former unit as well
as in the apartment above. Several said they were unaware of his
racist beliefs. In retrospect, though, they said that might explain
why the windows to his apartment were smashed four or five times by
strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say hello in passing, but we never communicated,'' said
Tyrese Alexander, who lives next door. ``He'd roll his eyes at me
and say nothing. But I couldn't imagine it was in his nature to do
such terrible things. I guess it means I should get to know my
neighbors better.''

CLINTON STARTS TOUR OF POCKETS OF POVERTY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAZARD, Ky. _ Against the mountainous backdrop of Appalachia,
one of America's most enduring symbols of poverty, President
Clinton Monday opened a campaign to widen the circle of the
nation's prosperity, saying if it doesn't happen now, ``we'll never
get around to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a time to bring more jobs and investment and hope to
the areas of our country that have not fully participated in this
economic recovery,'' he said. ``We have an obligation to do it,''
he told a cheering crowd of thousands gathered along Main Street on
a muggy 90-plus-degree day.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton came here to kick off what he has described as an
unprecedented presidential tour across America to promote public
and private programs to help the nation's estimated 36 million poor
people.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to present Congress with a proposal for tax incentives
and loan guarantees that his administration estimates will generate
$15 billion in new investment in urban and rural areas over five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the initiative is one way to continue to expand the
economy and drive the nation's 4.3 percent unemployment rate even
lower.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, corporate CEOs, and
members of Congress, the president will cover six states in four
days. Besides Appalachia, he will visit the Pine Ridge Indian
Reservation in South Dakota, Clarksdale in the Mississippi Delta,
and low-income sections of East St. Louis, Ill.; Phoenix; Los
Angeles; and Anaheim, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here in the hope that with the help of the business
leaders here, we could say to every corporate leader in America:
Take a look at investing in rural and inner-city America,'' he
said. ``It's good for business, good for America's growth, and it's
the right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe at this time of prosperity, if we can't find a way
to give every single hard-working American family the chance to
participate in the future we're trying to build for our country,
we'll never get around to do it,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In this coal and lumber town where President Lyndon B. Johnson
launched his War on Poverty in 1964, Clinton announced $1.5 million
in Department of Housing and Urban Development grants to benefit
the poor in Eastern Kentucky by improving housing and opportunities
for home ownership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though this is a blessed time for America, not all
Americans have been blessed by it,'' Clinton said. A banner behind
him read: ``Tapping America's potential, bring investment, hope,
and opportunity to Appalachia.''
</P>
<P>
   In Appalachia, 32 counties have poverty rates higher than 30
percent; the per capita income of the entire region is just 71
percent of the national average; and in some areas, 57.3 percent of
those over the age of 25 do not have a high school diploma.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton started his visit to Kentucky with a stop at Whispering
Pines, an isolated, impoverished neighborhood of trailers and
rundown houses in Tyner, population about 100.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a lawn chair in the shade of a walnut tree and
sipping a Mountain Dew, he visited with Jean Collett and her
father, Ray Pennington, in the front of her dilapidated rented
home.
</P>
<P>
   Collett, 48, was a cook at Dairy Queen until recently, when she
quit to take care of her father, who uses a portable oxygen tank
because he has emphysema. Collett had no electricity until 1961,
and no running water in a bathroom until five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Pennington, a widower, told Clinton: ``I've lived 69 years, and
this is the first time I've ever seen a president. It's a pleasure
to meet you.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton replied, ``Well, everybody's entitled to meet one
president, don't you think? People expect you to vote every
election, you ought to meet one now and then.''
</P>
<P>
   The president then made several unscheduled stops in town,
shaking hands and posing for pictures. At the Annville Stop-and-Go,
Cleda Stapleton Merritt, 59, told Clinton: ``Thank you, Mr.
President. I'm willing to go to bat for you and we'll hit a home
run. . . . Thank you for the economy, amen.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has proposed a tax credit for up to 25 percent of the
money a firm invests. His administration estimates the credit would
generate $6 billion in new equity capital at a cost to the
government of about $980 million over five years.
</P>
<P>
   The loan guarantee program would be styled after the Overseas
Private Investment Corp., which makes loans to promote US sales
abroad. The same principle would be followed domestically under
America's Private Investment Companies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton proposed providing up to $1 billion in government
guarantees for the domestic program.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the same reason industries are looking at Mexico, they
need to look at us. We can provide it here,'' he said Benny
Coleman, who runs a family home supply business in nearby Evarts,
drove to Hazard to see Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings Krahenbuhl, a retired school principal from London,
Ky., said, ``We are not asking for a handout, we are asking for a
hand. We just want to play in the game. We just need somebody to
blow a whistle to let us in.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton tries to do just that, analysts said his record on
behalf of America's poor is mixed.
</P>
<P>
   His former labor secretary, Robert Reich, an economist at
Brandeis University, said that other than expanding the earned
income tax credit in 1993 and helping keep unemployment low because
of the surging economy, ``the administration hasn't made much
headway on the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   While he applauded Clinton for focusing on those Americans left
behind as the economy has flourished, he said the administration's
early decision to make cutting the deficit a priority has tied its
hands and limited government investment in poor communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress is in no mood to entertain any major new
initiatives,'' he said. ``The president's budget plans don't
incorporate major spending for tax breaks for the poor or for those
areas. This is probably for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   But Harvard sociologist William Julius Wilson, who has written
extensively about poverty and given advice to Clinton, said the
president's initiative was a ``realistic program'' to help
distressed areas, given the limits of what he can accomplish with a
Republican-controlled Congress.

ALL-STAR VOTES ARE IN, AND JETER COMES UP SHORT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Mass., Wash., Texas, Fla., Md.)   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Derek Jeter, who had been considered the favorite to
start at shortstop in next Tuesday's All-Star Game in Boston, was
not ambushed in the Cleveland crusade that elected four members of
the Indians, but he did suffer from the apparent apathy of Yankees
fans.
</P>
<P>
   Nomar Garciaparra, the hometown favorite in Boston, edged Jeter
Monday by about 20,000 votes in the closest race in the balloting
for the American League team. Garciaparra, whose offensive
performance this season has been good but not as good as Jeter's,
won with a late rally, coming from 30,000 votes behind in the final
week of vote counting, which included all Internet votes.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, who was apparently aided by a Red Sox campaign in
the Internet phase of the voting, received 1,089,974 votes to
1,069,528 for Jeter. Omar Vizquel of Cleveland, who moved up
quickly in the final weeks of voting, finished third with
1,038,362.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to lie to you; I'd love to start the game,''
Jeter said after learning the results. ``But it's not going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Joe Torre, Jeter's manager and the AL manager for the
second time in three years, had talked about the emphasis placed on
the All-Star balloting in other cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do more politicking and lobbying in other ball parks as
far as passing out the ballots and collecting the ballots,'' Torre
said. ``We don't do that here.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter said: ``It's true. You go to Cleveland and you got stuff
on the scoreboard every half-inning. They don't do some of those
things in New York. In different cities they stress voting for the
All-Star Game more than they do in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Yankees should do more to get out the vote, Torre
said, ``If you want your players to get as many votes or more votes
than other people.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the clubs that do promote their players and the voting,
the manager said, ``If they want to spend the time to get their
players in the game, good for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he was disappointed in the results, Jeter did not
complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans vote; you count 'em and see who starts,'' he said.
``The fans are going to vote for who they want to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering the terrific season he is having, Jeter was asked if
the results were somewhat of a slap at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it shows the fans don't appreciate what you're
doing,'' he said. ``I just think it shows that the fans that voted
basically split it up. It was pretty close.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter is among the top four AL hitters in nine offensive
categories. Garciaparra, entering Monday's games, was among the top
three in four categories and the top 10 in three other categories.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter was second in hitting with a .377 average, Garciaparra
third at .366. Jeter was second with a .461 on-base percentage,
Garciaparra tied for ninth at .420. The Red Sox shortstop was third
with a .634 slugging percentage, Jeter tied for fourth at .630.
They were tied for third in extra-base hits with 42 each.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter, who was selected as a reserve for last year's game and
will go, Torre indicated, in that capacity next week, said there
was some consolation in losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I started,'' he said, ``they'd probably have booed me
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. of Seattle was the leading vote-getter for the
fourth successive season and seventh over all, receiving 2,918,055
votes. Roberto Alomar, the Indians' second baseman, was second with
2,793,891. Manny Ramirez and Kenny Lofton of Cleveland will join
Griffey in the starting outfield. First baseman Jim Thome was the
other member of the Indians who was elected to the team.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Cal Ripken of Baltimore was elected for the 15th
time and the 11th time in succession. Other starters will be Ivan
Rodriguez of Texas at catcher and Jose Canseco of Tampa Bay as the
designated hitter. (This was the first time the d.h. was on the
ballot.) Other than Canseco, the only only players who weren't
elected last year were Garciaparra and Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees will have no starters for the second successive
season.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Gonzalez of Texas, who said he would not go to the game as
a reserve because he objected to the Cleveland voting, placed fifth
among outfielders.
</P>
<P>
   POSADA APOLOGIZES TO UMPIRES  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Posada woke up Monday, realized he had made a serious
mistake and apologized to the umpires last night for critical
comments he made about the home-plate umpire in Sunday's game, Greg
Kosc.
</P>
<P>
   Kosc, who was forced to leave the game at Yankee Stadium between
the Yankees and the Baltimore Orioles because of heat exhaustion
and dehydration, was hospitalized overnight and returned home
Monday. He thus was not in the umpires' room when Posada went to
apologize, but the catcher expressed that sentiment to Larry
Barnett, the crew chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shouldn't have said what I said,'' Posada told reporters.
``I was mad. There was a lot of frustration inside of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Posada was upset at being called out on a questionable third
strike the inning before Kosc, 50, left the game. It reached a
record 100 degrees in New York on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line, the guys are not in shape,'' Posada said
after the game, referring to umpires. ``It was hot; I can
understand it's hot. You've got to be able to go through the game.
They're not prepared; they're not in shape. It's a shame. He gets
hot, the zone gets bigger. One doesn't go with the other one.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnett said Kosc was told to see his own doctor and to have his
blood-sugar level checked. ``His sugar was extremely high,''
Barnett said.

AGREEMENT TO ENABLE RUSSIA TO SEND TROOPS TO KOSOVO
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia is ready to resume sending troops to Kosovo,
officials said, after Russian and NATO negotiators solved a dispute
Monday over the role of Moscow's peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   The disagreement had threatened to put new strains on Russia's
shaky relationship with the Western alliance, after NATO blocked
Russian transport aircraft from flying to Kosovo last week.
</P>
<P>
   Russian and NATO officials said that military transport flights,
which have been waiting on the runway of an airport 200 miles
northeast of Moscow, could begin transporting paratroopers and
equipment to the Balkans as early as Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Russian military officials outside the 11-hour negotiations
revealed no details of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sides also confirmed that there are no obstacles to the
deployment of Russian peacekeeping forces in Kosovo,'' the Russian
Defense Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   General Wesley Clark, NATO's supreme commander, said the
agreement does not provide for Russian troops to expand into the
Italian-patrolled sector of Kosovo, as Russia had wanted. That
would have allowed Russia to station troops in contiguous zones,
which NATO ruled out because it does not want Russian troops to
have their own sector.
</P>
<P>
   With 700 troops already in Kosovo, Russia is expected to
increase its contingent to 3,600. US officials said last week they
directed Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania to close their airspace to
the flights after Moscow and NATO were unable to work out
differences over the role of the Russian peacekeepers in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's move provoked angry comments by military and diplmatic
officials, and cut into some of the pride Russians took from their
surprise deployment of 200 troops at Pristina's airport on June 12,
which upstaged the entrance of NATO peacekeepers into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow, which had objected strongly to NATO's airstrikes against
Yugoslavia and played a key diplomatic role in reaching a
settlement to the conflict, rushed its troops into Kosovo to assure
itself a major role in the peacekeeping operation. But some saw
NATO's move to refuse Russia airspace as a humiliating reminder of
Russia's subordinate position to the alliance in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are showing us who is boss, who is stronger,'' commented
Russian legislator Vladimir Lukin.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow has insisted it does not want its troops to take direct
orders from alliance generals.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, quoted by the Associated Press, said that Russian troops
would not have to follow NATO instructions on certain issues, such
as matters that contradict Russian law, like the apprehension of
war criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeepers' control of Kosovo is one of the factors that
has fueled Serb anger at Milosevic's government _ on top of the
destruction wrought by NATO's 78-day air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   There were these other developments:
</P>
<P>
   --An Army specialist struck by a car in Skopje, Macedonia, over
the weekend became the first US soldier to die in NATO's Kosovo
peacekeeping mission, US military officials said Monday. Specialist
Anthony W. Gilman, 23, of Michael, Ill., was hit by the car Sunday
afternoon after he stepped into traffic to place a warning triangle
on a road to alert approaching motorists to the site of a previous
accident. Two people in the car that struck Gilman also died. Their
identities were unavailable Monday.
</P>
<P>
   --Up to 10,000 chanting protesters took to the streets in a
southern Serbian town Monday _ the latest sign of growing anger at
President Slobodan Milosevic's government.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of how deep the discontent may be, Monday's protests
in Leskovac, 120 miles southeast of Belgrade, were not organized by
an opposition party _ they were inspired by a technician at the
local TV station.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, technician Ivan Novkovic came on during a break in a
broadcast of a basketball match and accused the local governor _ a
member of Milosevic's party _ of abusing his authority. Novkovic
urged people to rally Monday to demand his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands responded, chanting ``Thieves, thieves!'' and
``Changes, changes!'' while police made no attempt to stop the
march.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a member of any political party. My moves were
motivated solely by my conscience as a citizen,'' Novkovic told the
Danas independent daily.
</P>
<P>
   --Milosevic's government has also been shaken by Kosovo Serbs
fleeing the province in the face of revenge attacks by ethnic
Albanians for Serb forces' atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   The UN refugee agency estimates that more than 71,000 Kosovo
Serbs have fled the province since March 1998, but has no figures
for how many have left after the NATO deployment began. Belgrade
claims more than 100,000 Serbs have left Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of Kosovo's Serb community Monday demanded the
peacekeepers investigate crimes against Serbs in the province and
alleged the existence of prison camps in Kosovo holding Serbs. ``We
have clear indications'' that the camps exist, Serb Orthodox Bishop
Artemije and Kosovo Serb politician Momcilo Trajkovic said in a
letter to the private Beta news agency.
</P>
<P>
   They did not give any evidence about the camps or say where they
were located.
</P>
<P>
   --Sadako Ogata, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees on a visit
to Kosovo, expressed concern Monday for the Serb and Gypsy
minorities, but said the return of ethnic Albanian refugees was
going smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   So far, about 589,600 of the more than 860,000 refugees have
come home to Kosovo since NATO troops began deploying June 12, the
UN refugee agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Many have returned to find their homes burned and relatives
killed _ sparking reprisal attacks against Serbs and their
property.
</P>
<P>
   --Former Senator Bob Dole, completing a trip as the head of the
International Commission on Missing Persons, visited a mass grave
site near Pec Monday that held the bodies of 97 ethnic Albanians
thought to have been murdered by Serb security forces during the
NATO air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Time magazine reported Monday that President Clinton has
authorized the CIA to help topple Milosevic, who has been indicted
for war crimes. CIA computer hackers will try to meddle with
Milosevic's private financial transactions, deposit cash with
opposition organizations in Yugoslavia, and recruit dissidents in
the government and military, Time said.

   The Braves have apparently had it with those last-minute losses
in games they should have won.
</P>
<P>
   They've had three of them on the road trip and nearly another
one to start a seven-game homestand Monday night. But against the
N.L. East bottom-dwelling Marlins, the Braves dug a little deeper
and fought back for a 6-5 win, this after losing leads of 3-1, 4-3
and 5-4 in the game.
</P>
<P>
   After losing the last of those leads in the top of the ninth
inning, the Braves came fighting back by loading the bases with one
out in the bottom of the inning on a Bret Boone single, a wild
pitch, an intentional walk to Chipper Jones and a walk by Brian
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   That brought up Gerald Williams who singled just out of the
reach of Bruce Aven in left field to score Boone for the win.
</P>
<P>
   Closer John Rocker had not allowed a run all season at Turner
Field but came up with one on Monday to blow his second save in his
last three outings.
</P>
<P>
   He had a 5-4 lead heading into the ninth inning _ thanks in part
to Bret Boone's third home run in the last two days _ when he
loaded the bases on a pair of singles to Mike Redmond and Luis
Castillo and a walk to Dave Berg. He had a Bruce Aven 0-2 but then
lost him on a run-scoring walk to tie the game 5-5. Kevin McGlinchy
relieved him and coaxed the final out on a pop fly by Kevin Millar.
</P>
<P>
   Bret Boone commenced making up for lost time on Monday night
hitting his third home run in his last two games, after a stretch
of 43 games without one.
</P>
<P>
   His shot to left field off Brian Edmondson in the seventh inning
gave him his third home run in his last nine at-bats, this after
going 169 at-bats without one, and the Braves a 5-4 win over the
Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Boone hit two home runs in the Braves 7-6 loss to the Mets on
Sunday night, but he made sure this one counted as it put the
Braves on top for the third time in the game in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   It allowed the Braves to win a game started by Odalis Perez for
the first time since June 8 and start this seven-game homestand on
a winning note with their fourth win in five tries against the
Marlins this season.

VALLEY MAN'S MILITARY CAREER OVER
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Instead of celebrating Independence Day at a
Hawaii military base, a former U.S. Marine spent the holiday at his
Los Angeles home over the weekend after being discharged for
refusing to take the controversial anthrax vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Pvt. Roman J. Lezo had been one of the first Marines to face a
court-martial prosecution in a small but growing armed services
protest. But military officials in Kaneohe, Hawaii, instead offered
him a discharge under ``other than honorable circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am proud on this day for every American and I was proud to
serve as a Marine, but I have no regrets about what happened,''
said Lezo, 20, who pleaded guilty last month to disobeying the
order to take the shot. ``They are losing some of the best Marines
over this because they are ... taking their health as their first
priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Lezo was one of 14 Marines in Hawaii who refused to take the
series of six shots, base officials said. More than 200 troops, who
believe the drug is not properly tested and can cause long-term
health problems, have chosen punishment or resignation rather than
take the vaccine, according to Pentagon officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is finally out of the clutches of the Military-Industrial
Complex,'' said Lezo's mother, Roberta Lezo. ``We are ecstatic to
have him home.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than face six months in jail, loss of two-thirds of his
pay and a dishonorable discharge with a felony on his record, Lezo
opted to avoid a trial and admit guilt for disobeying an order.
</P>
<P>
   But because of his discharge, he has lost all of his military
benefits, including his right to the GI Bill, which would have
guaranteed him $15,000 for college.
</P>
<P>
   ``My health was my No. 1 concern. Nobody wanted to take these
shots,'' Lezo said. ``They are trying to push this shot on people
and it's not right.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame it had to come to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthrax is a bacterium that can be used as a biological warfare
agent _ one of the deadliest ever developed _ with a 90 percent
fatality rate if left untreated.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Food and Drug Administration approved the vaccine in
the 1970s, no long-term effects have been reported, said Virginia
Stephanakis, spokeswoman for the Army Surgeon General's Office at
the Pentagon. As of July 1, only 70 of the 303,000 vaccinated
troops have suffered side effects, Stephanakis said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Marines like Lezo have suffered greater consequences for
refusing the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, three Marines were court-martialed June 23 with
two others facing charges at Twentynine Palms Ground Combat Center
in the Mojave Desert.
</P>
<P>
   Six Marines based at the Miramar Marine Corps Air Station and
Camp Pendleton also are facing courts-martial for refusing to take
the mandatory shots.
</P>
<P>
   During his ordeal, Lezo said he was berated and sometimes
threatened by military officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would tell me that I was risking the lives of the entire
squad, and they warned me that if I didn't take it I would be
convicted and not be able to get a job even at McDonald's,'' Lezo
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lezo was charged with disobeying a lawful order from a
commanding officer and dereliction of duty. He also faced a charge
of failure to obey an order from a noncommanding officer, which was
not related to the anthrax case.
</P>
<P>
   Once a lance corporal with a secret security clearance, Lezo had
been demoted, given extra duties, confined to his barracks and lost
half of his pay prior to his discharge.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-Marine who was a helicopter mechanic is planning to
enroll in college in the fall and hopes to become a commercial
airline pilot. But in the meantime he is looking for work in the
aeronautics industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to start my life over,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And on this Independence Day, he spent the evening at a barbecue
with old friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to be home,'' he said.

THERE'S NO REASON TO HAMM IT UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ I went to Los Angeles International Airport to
greet the U.S. women's World Cup team Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Me and a cast of tens.
</P>
<P>
   The last time I was surrounded by so many pony-tailed pixies was
last fall, when I watched my favorite goal-goal girl, the
9-year-old daughter of friends, leave her heart and soul on a pitch
in Van Nuys.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I could say the effort and enthusiasm of all those mini
Mias left an indelible impression on me that day. Their postseason
game, after all, mattered as much to Cecilia and her teammates as
Saturday's World Cup final against China does to the U.S. squad.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, what sticks in my mind more than anything is the
beet-faced father who ran up and down the sidelines alongside his
daughter, commenting crassly on her every miscue _ even after time
ran out.
</P>
<P>
   Sad to say, overzealous adults got into the act again Monday,
turning a show of support into a vaudeville act. The best female
players on the planet were upstaged by people old enough to know
better.
</P>
<P>
   Mia Hamm and Co. couldn't have prepared themselves for it _ the
past two weeks have been one continuous revelatory reel for the
U.S. squad _ but when they disembarked from United Airlines Flight
2029, they were stepping into a scripted Hollywood scene.
</P>
<P>
   It apparently dawned on none of the Oz-like characters working
the hype-machine levers that what the most ogled, most celebrated
group of women since the Spice Girls really needs at this point is
rest, not more adoration.
</P>
<P>
   A chartered airplane and a chartered bus waiting on the airplane
tarmac to whisk them away surely would have played well with U.S.
team members, who are starting to show the fatigue of this pajama
party with America, now in its third week.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it wouldn't have played nearly as well on the 5
o'clock news, which explains why youth teams were summoned to Gate
88 in the United terminal and handed Women's World Cup T-shirts to
wear over tank tops and jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 minutes before the U.S. team's commercial flight from
San Francisco was scheduled to touch down, a woman prepped the
giddy girls (and a few bored-looking boys) as though they were a
Tonight Show studio audience.
</P>
<P>
   The youngsters were told that as soon as they saw the first U.S.
player pop out of the jetway, they were to begin chanting, ``Go
U-S-A.''
</P>
<P>
   Then flags and flowers were distributed among the kids along
with explicit instructions. The flowers were to be presented to the
players as they passed through the solid double-line procession on
their way to the baggage-claim area.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers at nearby gates waiting to board flights to San Jose,
San Franciso, Phoenix and Portland feigned disinterest. A few left
their seats and mingled with the soccer crowd, but the majority
seemed more fixed on their destinations than Team Destiny.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't really change when the plane bellied up to the gate
and its newly recognizable passengers spilled into the boarding
lounge and surged toward the street. Once the players moved past
the assembled throng, the cheering and clapping gave way to a few
muffled whispers of, ``Hey, isn't that....''
</P>
<P>
   The players looked relieved that people in the terminal were
going about their business and leaving them alone. (The lone
exception was Hamm, who had four journalists hoist television
cameras on their shoulders and form a moving wall in front of her,
the better to record every step and smile and sigh). But one woman,
decked out in World Cup garb, couldn't stand that more of a ruckus
wasn't being raised. She had to lift her arms over her head and
start clapping and chanting, ``C'mon. USA, All the Way. Clap with
me.''
</P>
<P>
   You go to airports and you expect to be hit up by missionaries
shaking change jars. But soccer zealots?
</P>
<P>
   Trying to summon sentiments out of the stale air does a
disservice to the U.S. team, which is good and gracious enough to
grab the public's attention on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Who wouldn't fall in love with athletes who compete for the love
of their sport and not for the money, who have bigger vocabularies
than egos?
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, these made-for-the-media moments are absolutely the only
thing about the U.S. women's World Cup team that is contrived.
</P>
<P>
   The players' ebullience and earnestness and eloquence is not the
product of a publicist's imagination. It is not a marketing hook.
It is not spin.
</P>
<P>
   What you see is what you get.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. women are guileless in a good way. They're as genuine
as the leather orb they boot and even tougher, which makes them a
ball to watch.
</P>
<P>
   In the players' hands, the sport is scintillating. As for the
people on the sidelines, they ought to stay in the background where
they belong.

A WIMBLEDON TO REMEMBER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ There was a spectacular final-round swan dive by the
three-time defending champion and a stealthy final-round swan song
by a seven-time champion. There was the re-ignition of an
all-American rivalry between two peers who believe that older and
balder means better, and the Grand Slam initiation of three female
prodigies with nothing more in common than family histories making
for headlines and tennis smarts bordering on the phenomenal.
</P>
<P>
   With a full cast of champions who elevated their games, and
emotions, to a fever pitch, and plot lines that seemed stolen from
a soap opera, the final Wimbledon of the 20th century was a dandy.
</P>
<P>
   History was made, youth was served, and Boris Becker, the German
who won Wimbledon at 17 and couldn't resist one last crack at it at
31, finally retired for real. Even John McEnroe got into the act,
but just as he had back when Bjorn Borg administered residual
thumpings, McEnroe went away mad _ stung that Steffi Graf
jettisoned their mixed doubles campaign two victories short of a
title because she feared it would compromise her quest for an
eighth _ and final _ Wimbledon singles crown.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Sampras and Lindsay Davenport buddied up and won the
singles championships in straight sets, then did a victory jig at
the Champions Ball on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Like a tired little homing pigeon, Andre Agassi, Sampras'
final-round victim, jumped on the casino scion Steve Wynn's private
jet and zipped back to Las Vegas. Steffi Graf, the 30-year-old icon
who decided her final-round loss to Davenport would be her last
appearance at Wimbledon, where she had won her past seven finals,
was as circumspect about her travel plans as she had been about her
retirement. She simply left the grounds in her rental car.
</P>
<P>
   When the tournament began, Davenport noticed the odds were
against her at 15-1 but restrained herself from taking that bet
``because I was afraid I'd get thrown out of tennis or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Anybody who homed in on those long odds was, she said, ``a
genius.'' Davenport settled for a six-figure prize and the No. 1
ranking, something the 29-year-old Agassi achieved, except that his
didn't come with a title attached.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, as he has for six of the last seven years, Sampras
put on his tennis whites like a suit of armor, brandished his
racquet like a mace and defended his favorite turf from pretenders
and usurpers like a king defending a castle. Against Agassi, in a
Sunday final that sparked like a family reunion, Sampras surprised
even himself by elevating his game to the fifth dimension for
history's sake, and for his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was the best match I ever played through my whole
career,'' the 27-year-old Sampras said. ``I'm not going to win
Wimbledon every year. But I've raised the bar so high that if I
don't do it, then something's wrong, and I guess that's kind of a
compliment in some ironic way. But as long as I feel like I can
play my game, yeah, I feel like I'm `the man' at Wimbledon.''
</P>
<P>
   This year ``the man'' finished up like a Roman candle: he lit up
the court and incinerated his incredulous opponent. He even dared
to fly.
</P>
<P>
   Three points away from the most historic Wimbledon championship
claimed by anyone in any century, Sampras performed his swan dive,
a valiant horizontal leap in vain pursuit of the biting crosscourt
forehand pass his desperate archrival flashed past him as a
reminder that he would not succumb quietly.
</P>
<P>
   En route to a record sixth Wimbledon championship and a 12th
career Grand Slam title, tying Roy Emerson's milestone, Sampras
chased after Agassi's brilliant shot like a hound on a scent.
</P>
<P>
   When gravity caught up with him after his volley failed, Sampras
touched down hard on the battered grass of Center Court. It left a
nasty red welt on his serving elbow. But instead of hobbling him,
it hurled him to new heights. With blood trickling down his arm, he
fired off the final two aces that secured the championship and
reconfirmed his place among, and perhaps above, predecessors like
Rod Laver, Don Budge, Fred Perry and Emerson. ``It was worth it,''
Sampras said about his flight. He may have lost the point, but he
definitely made his point: Wimbledon 1999 belonged to him.
</P>
<P>
   Both Sampras and Agassi, who made his own brand of history last
month at the French Open by joining those aforementioned champions
of yesteryear as the only member of his generation to capture all
four Grand Slam events, looked to the next Grand Slam, the U.S.
Open, as soon as this one ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fastened my seat belt six weeks ago, and I'm glad I did,''
Agassi said. ``It's going to be a wild ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the final electricity was generated by Sampras and
Agassi, the women grabbed their share of the marquee. The first
shocker came in the first round, with 129th-ranked, 16-year-old
Jelena Dokic's subjugation of top-seeded Martina Hingis, who
simultaneously declared her independence from her mother/coach,
Melanie Molitor.
</P>
<P>
   Dokic, Mirjana Lucic and San Diego's Alexandra Stevenson, the
first female qualifier to reach Wimbledon's semifinals, and their
various parents made headlines throughout the second week.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say about this Wimbledon is that it's the weirdest
Wimbledon I've ever played,'' Sampras said. And the best.

UNITED CHURCH OF CHRIST ELECTS NEW HEAD AND RESTRUCTURES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Ohio)  (mk) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The United Church of Christ, a denomination that traces some of
its roots back to the Puritans, elected as its new president Sunday
the Rev. John Thomas, a minister widely known for his work in
ecumenical relations.
</P>
<P>
   His election took place at the denomination's biennial business
session, the General Synod, as part of a restructuring of the
church's top offices that has been in the works for more than a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, 48, will succeed the Rev. Paul Sherry as president of
the 1.4 million-member denomination on Oct. 1. Since 1992, he has
served as Sherry's assistant for ecumenical concerns. Thomas' title
will become general minister and president on July 1, 2000, as part
of the changes adopted by the synod, which has been meeting in
Providence, R.I., since last week. The synod will conclude Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the restructuring, the number of officials in the
denomination's leadership will be reduced from more than a dozen to
five, and their responsibilities will be made more broadly equal.
At the denomination's head will be a collegium of officers made up
of five members who will take office next July.
</P>
<P>
   Four other candidates to round out that group were recommended
to the synod's delegates by search committees within the
denomination. The four _ elected like Thomas without opposition
Sunday _ were the Rev. Jose ``Joe'' Malayang, as executive minister
of local church ministries; Edith Guffey, as associate general
minister; Bernice Powell Jackson, as executive minister of justice
and witness ministries, and Dale Bishop, as executive minister of
wider church ministries. All are leaders in the denomination.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said that the United Church of Christ, whose national
agencies and local congregations are autonomous, has never had a
strictly top-down form of leadership, but the new structure ensures
that the denomination will move even further from that hierarchical
model.
</P>
<P>
   He said the idea of the president within the collegium could be
compared with a ``more ancient understanding'' of church
leadership, prevailing among Eastern Orthodox churches, in which
the ecumenical patriarch of Constantinople is first among equals
among the patriarchs of national Orthodox churches.
</P>
<P>
   The United Church of Christ, whose headquarters is in Cleveland,
was founded in a 1957 merger of the Congregational Christian
Churches and the Evangelical and Reformed Church.
</P>
<P>
   As ecumenical officer, Thomas was a principal figure in forging
one of the most important ecumenical documents of recent years, the
``formula of agreement,'' in 1997. The document created the basis
for formal, close cooperation among more than 10 million of the
nation's Protestants by establishing full communion between the
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and three denominations from
Protestantism's Reformed tradition, the Presbyterian Church (USA),
the United Church of Christ and the Reformed Church in America.
</P>
<P>
   Under the provisions of the agreement, the denominations agreed
to recognize one another's sacraments and clergy members and to
collaborate in missionary work and major social service projects.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, a native of Stamford, Conn., who is married with two
children and is a 1975 graduate of Yale Divinity School, said the
United Church of Christ would continue to reach out to other
Christian communities, including immigrant groups.
</P>
<P>
   He said other concerns for the denomination include speaking out
with a Christian viewpoint in an increasingly secular culture,
attending to the needs for ``exciting worship and spiritual depth''
in local congregations, and developing an understanding of the
nation's religious pluralism so that the denomination is
cooperative, rather than competitive, with other faith groups.

INSURANCE FRAUD SHOWS HOLES IN STATES' REGULATORY NET 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Even in the early days of what would become
one of the largest insurance frauds in the nation's history, a top
Tennessee insurance examiner noticed that Franklin American Corp.
was reporting stratospheric profits on garden-variety bonds.
</P>
<P>
   During a routine look at the company's books, Bill Hosea,
Tennessee's most senior insurance regulation expert, noted
extraordinary capital gains and scribbled in the margins of the
financial statement, ``Wow!''
</P>
<P>
   That occurred on Feb. 23, 1993, more than six years before
authorities say they discovered that Martin Frankel, a 44-year-old
Connecticut money manager, had siphoned several hundred million
dollars from Franklin and fled the United States. Frankel, federal
prosecutors say, used fake bond-trading records to entice a string
of Southern insurance companies to invest their money with him.
Then he stole it, authorities say.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's insurance commissioner, Douglas Sizemore, has
acknowledged no failings by his agency in the case. Indeed, he has
argued that his regulators should be credited for cracking the
case.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that the fraud continued for almost eight years
despite regulators' misgivings has become an acute embarrassment
for many state insurance regulators. It has also become a rallying
point for people who favor at least some federal involvement in
regulating insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Examiners in Tennessee's Department of Commerce and Insurance
made note of irregularities in Franklin's investments, including
excessive bond-trading volume and claims of abnormally high
profits, in nearly every quarterly financial review from 1993 until
Frankel's organization unraveled in May, state records show.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Sizemore and the state's other top insurance officials
repeatedly declined to act on their own examiners' recommendations
for a full investigation, the records show. What is more, until at
least late last year, Tennessee regulators did not communicate
concerns about Franklin to other states where the company operated.
</P>
<P>
   And state investigators were apparently befuddled by Franklin's
claims that it used specialized trading techniques requiring it to
turn over its assets to a tiny brokerage house called Liberty
National Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's insurance department has declined to make officials
available for interviews, only letting them give written answers to
written questions.
</P>
<P>
   When state officials pressed for an explanation of Franklin's
trading practices in 1997, the company submitted a
professional-looking quarterly report that seemed to show day
trading, or rapid-fire buying and selling, of government bonds.
Liberty National, the report indicated, made a single buy or sell
order for bonds valued at roughly $50 million each weekday from
April to June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Had they investigated, the Tennessee regulators might have
discovered that Liberty was a Michigan-based company with revenue
in the tens of thousands of dollars that could not possibly handle
the volume of trading Franklin claimed. But they did not; a full
investigation was forestalled for two more years.
</P>
<P>
   When leading bond-trading experts were shown the same report
recently, they said the fraud should have been easily detected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pattern is totally fabricated,'' said Stan Jonas, a
government bond trader at Fimat USA in New York. ``It's pretty
obvious that the gentlemen at Liberty National are just printing
tickets. These trades probably were never executed.''
</P>
<P>
   Alone in the financial world, insurers are regulated exclusively
by the states, with federal authorities barred by acts of Congress
from interfering. The industry's unique standing is a result of the
view that insurance is a geographically specific issue best left to
local agencies to police _ as well as its status as a lucrative
revenue source jealously guarded by the states.
</P>
<P>
   But the Frankel case has added momentum to those who argue that
state autonomy in insurance regulation is outdated. At a minimum,
the fraud and intense coverage it has received seem likely to add
pressure on states to improve oversight or risk losing some
authority, government and industry leaders said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the states can't rise to the occasion, we could wind up
with federal control,'' said Neil Levin, New York's superintendent
of insurance. ``Better supervision will have to come one way or the
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Of particular concern to some industry experts is how Frankel
skirted states known for tight regulation: Texas, California,
Florida, New York and Connecticut, which together employ more than
half of the nation's insurance regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin American, which authorities say was controlled behind
the scenes by Frankel, bought troubled insurers in Oklahoma,
Mississippi and Missouri as well as in Tennessee _ all states with
relatively small insurance regulatory teams.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the fraud could occur, experts say, is that most
insurance regulators know about revenues from policies but
relatively little about the investment world.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's lots of easy pickings out there if you want to run a
scam,'' said Robert Hunter, a former Texas insurance commissioner
who now runs the insurance arm of the Consumer Federation of
America. ``Most state regulators really do not understand or pay
attention to investments.''
</P>
<P>
   The regulation of insurers is a looming issue as Congress
overhauls supervision of financial companies. The House of
Representatives voted last Thursday night to end Depression-era
restrictions that have largely kept banks, securities firms and
insurers out of each other's businesses. Lawmakers will try later
this summer to reconcile the House legislation with a different
version adopted by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   With companies from those three industries already melding into
conglomerates like the new Citigroup, many analysts predict even
faster consolidation in the financial industry as traditional
barriers fall.
</P>
<P>
   And as different kinds of financial companies merge, the
authorities that regulate them _ including federal agencies like
the Federal Reserve, the Treasury Department and the Securities and
Exchange Commission as well as state insurance commissions _ will
face pressure to coordinate their activities, many in the industry
argue.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some state officials contend that the record of state insurance
regulators compares favorably to federal oversight of the
securities and banking industries. But many also acknowledge that
it took Tennessee longer to expose Frankel's fraud than they would
have liked.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel's fraudulent behavior began even before he bought the
nearly bankrupt Franklin in late 1991. At the time, he was under
investigation by the SEC for securities fraud in Ohio and would
soon accept a settlement that barred him from the securities
business.
</P>
<P>
   He circumvented that prohibition by setting up Thunor Trust in
the name of three acquaintances, at least two of whom now say they
had no involvement in the matter, to acquire Franklin and manage
its money.
</P>
<P>
   There is no indication Tennessee authorities knew that Frankel,
who used many aliases, was involved in Thunor. The trust was run by
John Hackney, a Nashville-area businessman and former banker who
now says he was duped by Frankel.
</P>
<P>
   But regulators did not seek to verify sworn statements from the
people who put up nearly $4 million to back Thunor, an inquiry that
might have exposed Frankel's fraud early on. Tennessee insurance
officials said last week that the affidavits satisfied legal
requirements for background checks.
</P>
<P>
   Under Frankel's control, Franklin reported strong earnings, but
the bulk came from investing insurance assets rather than from
writing new policies. In 1998, the company said its total assets
had grown to $141 million from $31 million in 1991. That amounted
to an annual compound rate of return of more than 17 percent,
extraordinary for a company claiming to invest only in safe,
high-grade government bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee authorities clearly wondered about those claims all
along. Hosea's notation on the 1993 statement was followed by
warnings from colleagues. In 1994, for example, regulators asked
Hackney to discuss his trading strategy, internal records show,
though they do not reveal what was discussed.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, regulators began pressuring Franklin, which was
reporting only lump-sum results, to detail trading practices. A
short time later, Kathy Fussell and Robert Ribe, two Tennessee
insurance analysts, wrote a series of memos calling for a special
examination of Franklin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recommend that we find someone who is a specialist in
investment activities and settle this,'' Ms. Fussell wrote in
August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   When Tennessee authorities got their first look at Franklin's
detailed trading records, concern grew. The purported day-trading
strategy meant that in three months, Franklin's portfolio of bonds
_ worth more than $50 million _ had been bought and sold nearly 100
times.
</P>
<P>
   But the insurance department delayed an examination until a
regularly scheduled five-year audit of Franklin in late 1998, more
than a year later. The delay angered some state examiners, people
close to the regulators said. Department officials deny that there
was any difference of opinion on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   When the investigation was finally conducted, an outside
specialist discovered serious problems. For one, Liberty National
in Michigan had assets of less than $60,000 _ making it
ill-equipped to handle the billions of dollars in reported trades.
</P>
<P>
   The review also found, apparently for the first time, that
Franklin was placing nearly all its assets under Liberty National's
control. That was an apparent violation of state rules requiring
insurers to store their bonds in banks or trust companies. In late
1998, Tennessee officials ordered Franklin to retrieve its
investment assets from Liberty and put them in a bank.
</P>
<P>
   The order was not immediately enforced. Franklin hired Harlan
Mathews, a former U.S. senator and now a partner in the Tennessee
law firm of Farris Mathews Branan &AMP; Hellen, to fight for Franklin's
right to keep investing with Liberty. In February, records show,
Mathews helped win a temporary waiver of the order. That gave
Franklin until early April before it would have to move its assets
to a bank.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee officials said that Mathews' political influence did
not affect the department's handling of the case. Mathews did not
return a phone call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Even when examiners focused their full attention on Franklin's
problems, they did not conduct what Wall Street firms would
consider rudimentary due diligence.
</P>
<P>
   There is no indication, for example, that any Tennessee official
phoned or visited the Michigan offices of Liberty National. If they
had, Robert Guyer, the president of the tiny brokerage house, would
have denied any dealings with Franklin American. They would have
learned that Frankel, an old acquaintance of Guyer, had usurped
Liberty's name for his own purposes, according to Guyer's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did investigators seek the advice of bond traders to analyze
Franklin's purported trading technique. If they had, they might
have quickly spotted a fraud. Even after a short examination, Jonas
of Fimat said it was obvious to him that the purported trades had
been ``just clearly manufactured.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, federal authorities say they suspect that Frankel may
have used the cover of an active trading strategy by Liberty as an
excuse to gain total control over Franklin's investment portfolio.
Many doubt that the trades, at least in anything approaching the
volume claimed, were ever made.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee officials defend their investigation. ``It's not
normal practice to consult Wall Street experts,'' they said in
written comments.
</P>
<P>
   That practice could change, however, if New York's example
catches on. The state's insurance commission recently became the
first in the nation to hire longtime Wall Street traders to
scrutinize insurance company investment practices.
</P>
<P>
   George Dale, the insurance commissioner of Mississippi whose
state was also affected by the collapse of Frankel-controlled
companies, said outsiders should not rush to judgment on how state
regulators did their jobs. Insurance examiners are usually on guard
for losses that might lead to insolvency, he said, not for
exaggerated profits. But he acknowledged that all the states
involved could have paid more attention to red flags.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen a fraud like this in my experience,'' Dale
said. ``But when something bad like this happens, we can learn from
it.''

FINGERHUT GIVES FEDERATED EDGE IN E-COMMERCE
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Wal-Mart Stores Inc. announced late last month that it had
hired the Fingerhut Companies to process orders and handle
distribution over the Internet, it sent a delicious little jolt
through the retail industry.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Fingerhut, the second largest cataloger in the
country _ it hawks everything from pots and pans to stereos _ was
acquired by Federated Department Stores in March. Now Wal-Mart, the
world's largest retailer, will give its competitor Federated, whose
chains include Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Burdine's, a little cut
of every online purchase by customers for the next three years. One
can almost hear Dick Zimmerman, Federated's chief executive,
singing, ``How sweet it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wal-Mart deal adds to the impression that when it comes to
the Web, Federated is ahead of the game. Federated's stock has
risen 29 percent since the Fingerhut purchase was disclosed in
February, though it initially declined on fears that Federated
might be overpaying.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Eagan, managing director of Blackrock, one of Federated's
largest shareholders, said: ``Mature retailers need to show they
have a strategy in this area. Federated has shown they are thinking
outside the box and ahead of the competition on this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Providing services to burgeoning e-commerce ventures promises to
be big business for the near future, which is why Fingerhut's
positioning as a provider of back-end support is particularly
enticing to investors. In theory, the companies best poised to make
money on the Web are the ones supplying services everyone needs _
like package delivery _ not the one's selling directly with
exorbitant marketing costs and no profits in sight.
</P>
<P>
   But while Fingerhut's various internet ventures clearly are on a
growth trajectory, it will be a while before they can contribute
substantially to Federated's bottom line. Currently, Fingerhut's
Business Services, the division that handles such outsourcing, is
projecting $40 million in revenue for this calendar year. Even if
it ultimately grows to the ambitious $1 billion target of its
executives, that is still a fraction of Federated's $17 billion in
revenues
</P>
<P>
   A Federated spokeswoman, Carol Sanger, said the company does not
expect that Fingerhut will represent more than 15 percent of
revenue for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics say the aura of Internet is clouding investors'
thinking. ``The numbers at Fingerhut aren't big enough to move the
needle,'' said Brian James, senior retail analyst at Loomis Sayles,
who attributes the stock increase largely to better-than-predicted
sales at Federated's stores. Still, there is a growing perception
that Federated did something right, he said. ``It's funny, now that
sales in the core business have turned around and made them look
smarter, people are giving more credibility to their Internet
strategy,'' James said.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the Fingerhut ventures creating the most
excitement have little to do with Federated brands. First and
foremost, there is Fingerhut Business Services, the division that
Wal-Mart hired to handle back-office functions such as warehousing,
customer service and distribution for emerging e-retailers. Only a
year old, the division has 22 clients with name brands like Wet
Seal, Levi's and Intuit.
</P>
<P>
   Fingerhut has three highly automated warehouses, each with 1.2
million square feet. Roughly half that space is excess, or
available to the highest bidder. Fingerhut also has 50 years of
experience in direct-to-consumer retailing and one of the largest,
most detailed customer data bases in the business.
</P>
<P>
   John Buck, president of the business services subsidiary,
predicts his little division will grow to ``$100 million by 2000,
and easily be a billion-dollar business five or 10 years down the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   The second part of Fingerhut's Internet plan involves buying
pieces of a wide range of e-commerce models. Since last year,
Fingerhut has bought stakes in a half dozen young Internet firms.
The unifying thread is that they all offer services that Fingerhut
believes are a match for its extensive consumer base. PC Flowers
and Gifts is a good example. By hooking the little site into the
cataloger's data base, it has substantially beefed up its sales.
Andy Johnson, president of Fingerhut's e-commerce division, said
that 20 percent to 25 percent of the gift site's customers use the
Fingerhut credit card.
</P>
<P>
   Two of these half dozen sites have already registered to go
public (PCFlowers and Gifts and FreeShop.com, a site for consumer
service and product promotions) and could generate cash for
Federated if they find a receptive stock market. In addition,
Johnson estimates that all of Fingerhut's sites _which includes the
half-dozen investments as well as the Federated offshoots and
Fingerhut's own Web offering _ will generate some $100 million in
revenue this year and are poised for growth.
</P>
<P>
   But all of Fingerhut's enthusiasm for building Internet-related
business is a little like the tail wagging the dog. The real
question is how is Fingerhut doing when it comes to expanding its
core businesses online. The two main issues are reaching more
people who want Federated's brands and bringing its own vast
audience of catalog shoppers to the Web. Company executives are
vague on both topics.
</P>
<P>
   Fingerhut's customers are generally described as people of
moderate income, which is the very group that is not now on the
Internet. Johnson says that 62 percent of Fingerhut's customers
have access to the Web, but he declines to answer how many have
actually shopped online. ``We are not worried about today's
penetration. This is the future and all of our customers will be
there'' eventually, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for helping Bloomingdale's and Macy's dominate upscale
department store shopping on the Web the way they do in real life,
Fingerhut is still exploring the possibilities. It holds
twice-weekly phone summits with all its Web companies to discuss
``best practices,'' but beyond that outsiders are being left to
guess at the synergies. Lucky for Fingerhut, Internet valuations
are not about numbers, but about buzz.

MRS. CLINTON'S PLAN FOR NEUTRALIZING THE CARPETBAGGING ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ``Listening to New Yorkers'' discussions that Hillary Rodham
Clinton is planning for the exploratory phase of her Senate
campaign will focus on familiar political issues: health care,
public schools and the economy.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, though, there is a more fundamental mission to these
forums, and it has less to do with the problems facing the nation
than with the problems confronting Mrs. Clinton's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   The real goal, Mrs. Clinton's advisers acknowledge, is less to
educate her than to address what they see as her most serious
vulnerability _ that she is seeking to represent in the Senate a
state where she has never lived.
</P>
<P>
   This is a case where what a candidate says may not matter, and
according to her advisers, Mrs. Clinton plans to say very little of
substance in the months ahead, starting with the six ``Listening to
New Yorkers'' forums that she has scheduled this week in central
New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, her intention, aides said Monday, is to spend so much
time in New York, with a procession of cookie-cutter forums
intended to produce a daily diet of television images, that her
trips to the state become as routine as a visit by the first lady
can be. In that way, her aides hope that Mrs. Clinton, a native of
Illinois, will become as familiar a part of the state's political
geography as, say, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a couple of weeks, people are going to look and say, `She's
still out there,''' Mandy Grunwald, one of Mrs. Clinton's
strategists, asserted. ``And a couple of weeks later, they're going
to look again and say she's STILL out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Mrs. Clinton, who will formally register an exploratory
committee for her campaign with federal election officials Tuesday,
can succeed at this strategy is open to question but is critical to
her ambitions in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Giuliani, the Republican who is also interested in
running for the seat, are dubious that she can, as are some
independent political analysts following the race.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is a factor working in her favor: The calendar.
There are 16 months until the vote to replace Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, the Democrat who is not running for re-election in 2000,
and that is a huge stretch of time in American politics.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, such a long campaign presents the risk of
overexposure or campaign missteps. But it might also give the first
lady enough time so that by next year she can, with some
credibility, claim ties to a state where she has never lived a day.
And even if she cannot quite get away with that assertion, it is a
reasonable bet that over time, the issue of carpetbagging will lose
some of its edge: that an attack that seems highly potent today
will seem stale and familiar, particularly if it remains as much in
the spotlight as it has been so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   And from this perspective, Giuliani's relentless focus on Mrs.
Clinton's residency seems an odd bit of political strategy, as even
Giuliani's own supporters have begun to acknowledge. It is not that
they think he should not raise the topic. But by doing it so soon,
he may actually be helping to inoculate Mrs. Clinton from attacks
on the issue next year, when they will really matter.
</P>
<P>
   It may only be a matter of time until the press, and the public,
tire of this topic and move on to other ones, which will make it
harder to move the carpetbagger question back to center stage when
the 2000 campaign comes around.
</P>
<P>
   There is, one of the mayor's friends said, no grand strategy
being executed: It is only Giuliani being Giuliani. Another
adviser, Bruce Teitelbaum, the head of Giuliani's political action
committee, maintained that Giuliani was only responding to the
inquiries of reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani certainly seems to encourage the questions.
</P>
<P>
   He has, for example, decided to make a fund-raising trip to
Little Rock, Ark. Little Rock is known for many things in American
politics, including being the former home of a certain first lady,
but fund-raising is generally not one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, Giuliani's trip will provide the grist for a few
more articles about Mrs. Clinton and carpetbagging, which may well
be exactly what Mrs. Clinton needs right now.

SURVEY OF JAPANESE BUSINESS SHOWS PESSIMISM ABATING 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Japanese central bank's quarterly assessment of
business sentiment suggested Monday that while executives have not
yet heaved sighs of relief about the nation's economy, they are
breathing easier.
</P>
<P>
   The survey from the Bank of Japan, known as the tankan index,
showed that the perception of business conditions among more than
9,000 who responded in June was still negative, but improving.
</P>
<P>
   The results fell within the range of estimates by economists,
who had anticipated that huge government spending on public works
projects and loan guarantees for small and midsized enterprises, as
well as an improvement in other Asian economies that import
Japanese goods, would help assuage any lingering fears of much
worse times to come.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark Nikkei index of 225 Japanese stocks rose 1.13
percent Monday, to 18,135.06 _ its highest close in 21 months.
</P>
<P>
   But the survey's so-called diffusion index remained solidly
negative, meaning that pessimistic executives still widely
outnumbered optimists. This index _ the difference between the
percentage of companies that consider business to be improving and
those that regard it as worsening _ rose to a minus 37 from minus
44 at the end of March.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current level is still below the trough reached in the
1986 and 1992 recessions,'' said Russell Jones, chief economist at
Lehman Brothers here. ``Also, what's clear is that the overhang of
excess capacity, both in the physical sense of production capacity
and in terms of labor, is huge and remains a big depressant on the
economy going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jones and others say that the economy has stabilized
after hitting bottom at the end of last year. The government is
expected to throw more money into the system in the fall, since
private industry is as yet in no condition to begin fueling its own
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has Japanese industry shown any signs of embarking on the
kind of large-scale cutbacks that many here say is needed. A senior
official at the central bank noted that total employment among
businesses responding to the survey dropped 1 percent between March
and June, and among large companies, there was no change at all. In
the March survey, employment dropped an average of 1.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``My big worry is that employment restructuring is not taking
place in a big way,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``I'm afraid that Japanese corporations are delaying
reductions in manpower that they've promised, thanks to an
improvement in business prospects.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other officials, he is concerned that nascent recovery will
stifle the urge to cut work forces and pare down businesses.
``Essentially what you're seeing reflected in the tankan is an
improvement in mood and outlook,'' he said, ``and that may not be a
good thing for the economy at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the central bank moved to curb some of the enthusiasm
its report aroused, again intervening in the currency market to
sell yen and restrain the currency's rise after the tankan survey's
release. Indeed, traders were preparing last week for a rush of
foreign investment if the survey lived up to economists'
predictions, which would drive the yen's value up against the
dollar and hurt major Japanese exporters.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's intervention showed some results. The yen settled in
London trading at 122.26 to the dollar, off from Friday's New York
rate of 120.96 to the dollar. (American markets were closed for the
Independence Day holiday.)
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the government released first-quarter gross domestic
product data last month suggesting that the economy was on track to
grow 7.9 percent, the central bank has repeatedly moved to rein in
the yen. Neither the government nor private economists think the
economy is really that robust, and economists said that Monday's
survey offered a more realistic assessment of economic prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to the very good numbers we saw a few weeks ago, the
tankan was a lot more modest,'' said Tadashi Nakamae, president of
Nakamae International Economic Research. ``I think it's more in
line with the reality, although corporate managers are still overly
optimistic about the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey suggested that companies expect profit to rise rather
sharply, even while anticipating flat revenue. But without sharper
job cutbacks, there is little chance that they will be able to
squeeze significantly greater profits from their sales,
particularly since expansion plans have declined more sharply than
economists anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists suggested that the expectations of greater
profitability could indicate that plans for corporate revamping,
thus far vague, will be further-reaching than many thought.
``Either they're incredibly optimistic, or intending to reduce
labor costs and investment sharply,'' Jones said. ``It could be
indicative of quite a lot of restructuring.''

ORIOLES' SURHOFF MAKES HIS CASE FOR ALL-STAR DESIGNATION
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ B.J. Surhoff, the day after he beat the Yankees with
a tie-breaking grand slam, again propelled the Baltimore Orioles
past the Yankees, 9-1, Monday in 100-degree heat.
</P>
<P>
   Surhoff, the Orioles' hitter with the most productive career
performance against Andy Pettitte, set up their first run with a
first-inning single, then drove home the fourth run with a
fourth-inning single against the troubled left-hander.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with Jason Grimsley pitching in the seventh inning,
Surhoff sealed the victory by whacking a three-run home run an
estimated 419 feet over the center-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Yankees Manager Joe Torre apparently had
already decided that Surhoff deserved a spot as a reserve on the
American League All-Star team, which will be named Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Surhoff, who has never been on an All-Star team in his 13-year
career, clinched a spot by raising his batting average to .342, his
RBIs to a team-leading 69, his home run total to a team-leading 20
and his number of hits to a league-leading 118.
</P>
<P>
   But just in case Torre had any lingering question, Surhoff
erased it in the sixth inning, after Doug Johns, a nondescript
member of the Orioles' ineffective relief corps, had relieved Mike
Mussina.
</P>
<P>
   With Yankees runners at first and second, two out and the
Orioles ahead, 4-1, Chili Davis lashed a line drive to left field
that appeared to have a good chance of reaching the fence for a
two-run double. But Surhoff raced back, reached up as the ball
whizzed overhead and snared it, keeping the ball from its
appointment with the fence.
</P>
<P>
   His two-way effort made it easy for Mussina to gain his 10th
victory, even though he pitched only five and one-third innings.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At this rate, the Yankees won't have to worry about losing to
Mussina at Yankee Stadium until 2005. Mussina is in his eighth
season as one of the best pitchers in the American League, but he
couldn't prove it by his performance over the years against the
Yankees. Against the rest of the league, Mussina has a 124-71
record, a .636 winning percentage. When he walked to the mound to
start Monday night, though, he was saddled with a 3-8 record and a
.273 winning percentage against the Yankees. Worse, the only time
he had defeated the Yankees at their park was the first time he
pitched in New York, way back in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Mussina allowed the Yankees only two hits in the first four
innings, then gave up a pair of singles in the fifth. But he
retired Chuck Knoblauch on a fly to center field for the third out
and maintained his 4-1 lead. But when the Yankees stroked a pair of
one-out singles in the sixth, Manager Ray Miller decided Mussina
had had enough.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Surhoff bailed out Mussina with his fine running
catch, and minutes later Cal Ripken slugged his 11th home run of
the season, a two-run shot against Grimsley. Surhoff added his
three-run home run in the next inning, and the Orioles, whose
losing streak had reached a season-high 10 games, somehow emerged
with a split of their four-game visit to New York.

AN ADVOCATE FOR INDONESIA'S DEBTORS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By WAYNE ARNOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Bankruptcy has been very, very good to
Hotman Paris Hutapea.
</P>
<P>
   Since last August, when Indonesia inaugurated a new bankruptcy
law and a new commercial court to enforce it, the outspoken
39-year-old lawyer has become the man to go to for companies trying
to elude creditors. He claims to have handled roughly half of the
50-odd bankruptcy cases filed so far with the court, including one
of his rare defeats, which came only after Indonesia's Supreme
Court reversed its own ruling on behalf of creditors from the World
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a leading Indonesian business magazine put Hutapea's
face on its cover as one of the ``most expensive'' people of 1999.
In a nation where judges earn less than $3,000 a year, clients pay
Hutapea on average $50,000 up front to take cases that will last
only a month, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many big debtors like me,'' he says, his hands folded in
front of him to reveal a diamond-encrusted gold watch, a gold
bracelet and a heavy opal ring.
</P>
<P>
   Many lawyers here say Hutapea has an uncanny ability to persuade
Jakarta's judges to rule in his clients' favor. ``The judge doesn't
control the proceedings. Hotman does,'' says P.D.D. Dermawan, a
Jakarta lawyer, who has faced Hutapea several times in court,
though not in bankruptcy cases. ``You have to see it to believe
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutapea has been so successful that frustrated bankers are
criticizing the new bankruptcy law as inadequate and the courts as
inept, anti-foreigner or just plain corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike bankruptcy laws in the West, which typically aim to
protect debtors, Indonesia's new bankruptcy law was designed by the
International Monetary Fund to give creditors a legal cudgel to
force Indonesia's deeply indebted, but well-connected, corporate
elite to pay up.
</P>
<P>
   Hutapea says his clients deserve the best lawyer money can buy,
but his zeal in defending Indonesian debtors reflects his own
conviction that the IMF-sponsored law represents an unfair foreign
dictate, even if Indonesia's legislature approved it. Besides
helping clients skirt foreclosure, he is helping them counterattack
by suing prominent foreign banks, accusing them of selling
derivatives that ended up deepening borrowers' troubles. He has
also sued some foreign businesses that he contends have operated
illegally in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian companies owe at least $98 billion to banks,
bondholders and other creditors, $65 billion of it to foreigners.
Some analysts estimate that four of every five Indonesian companies
are in technical default, so much of their debts are in default.
But under Indonesia's previous bankruptcy law, adopted nearly a
century ago under Dutch rule, cases could drag on indefinitely. So
when the IMF came in with a $40 billion bailout package in late
1997, it demanded a new law to strengthen the rights of creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Economists and consultants say the court's bankruptcy rulings
are damaging confidence among potential foreign investors and
delaying Indonesia's recovery. When the auto maker PT Astra
International stopped paying its creditors last August, for
example, bankers waited 11 months for a deal rather than go to
court. ``We didn't trust Indonesian bankruptcy law,'' said Shingo
Ota, senior vice president at the Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd.,
Astra's largest foreign creditor. ``We didn't know how long it
would take or how much it would cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Some lawyers say the disappointment over the bankruptcy court
highlights the inadequacy of any bankruptcy court to solve problems
on the scale of Indonesia's. Bankruptcy laws are not meant to deal
with an entire national meltdown, said James Redway, a lawyer with
the Philadelphia-based law firm of Morgan, Lewis &AMP; Bockius. ``What
we have here,'' Redway says, ``is the entire economy walking into
the hospital at the same time and saying, `I'm dying, help me,' and
there aren't enough operating rooms to deal with them all.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutapea, who concedes that he wins most of his cases on
technicalities, agrees, adding that it is not the law that is
inadequate, it is the lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't know what they're doing,'' he says of his
opponents. ``They don't know how to read the mind of the judge.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutapea was born in northern Sumatra to a family descended from
the Batak, a famously argumentative tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Hutapea earned his law degree from a small Catholic university
on the main island of Java when he was 21. Two years later, he
joined a law firm in Jakarta, where he remained until May, when he
formed his own practice.
</P>
<P>
   While Hutapea's career was developing, Indonesia's legal system
remained stunted. Poorly paid judges succumbed to politics and
patronage. Hutapea declined to comment on the corruptibility of
judges, other than to say, ``I'm only asking you: are other
officials in this society corruptible?''
</P>
<P>
   Bankers with long-time experience in Indonesia must surely be
experiencing deja vu.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Schwarz, in his 1994 book, ``A Nation in Waiting,'' about
Indonesia under former President Suharto, offers as a case study of
the frustrations the story of Bentoel, an Indonesian cigarette
maker that in 1991 told creditors it was insolvent and owed $350
million. Bentoel's bankers, including Citibank and the Bank of
Tokyo, eventually filed a bankruptcy petition against one Bentoel
shareholder who had personally guaranteed the company's loans. A
court in Bentoel's hometown ruled that the banks could not enforce
a personal guarantee unless the company was in liquidation, which
it was not. Successfully defending the guarantor was Hutapea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the murderer is entitled to a lawyer,'' Hutapea said. And
in the style of the American lawyers Alan Dershowitz and Johnnie
Cochran, Hutapea took on notorious clients. In late 1997, he
represented Suharto's second-eldest son, Bambang Trihatmodjo, in a
short-lived case against the government's decision to liquidate
Bambang's Bank Andromeda. (He said he dropped the suit because it
was too sensitive politically.) And when two riot policemen went on
trial in June for the shooting deaths of four university students
during a demonstration, Hutapea was on the defense team. (Each
received a sentence of less than a year in jail.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When the new bankruptcy law was adopted in April, Hutapea called
it the end of the deadbeat era and a great opportunity for lawyers,
whose own fortunes were sagging with those of their corporate
clients. The best part about the new law was how it expedited
cases. Instead of taking months or years, the court must reach a
verdict within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   It is in the decrepit Central Jakarta District Court building,
littered with flattened cigarette butts, that Hutapea argued the
new bankruptcy law's first case. His client was a
Japanese-Indonesian construction company that had not been paid for
a golf course it had built. He won a court-supervised
restructuring. He also won a case on behalf of 11 foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
   Then he began a string of victories for debtors. He thwarted a
bid by American Express Bank to force a cocoa producer into
bankruptcy proceedings. He saved the owner of a Sheraton hotel. He
convinced the Supreme Court to overturn the victory over a builder
by two would-be tenants who had made down payments for unbuilt
apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Hutapea is also known for a blistering attack on Jerry Hoff, a
Dutch lawyer who helped the International Monetary Fund draft the
bankruptcy law and who was the winning lawyer in one of Hutapea's
rare courtroom defeats.
</P>
<P>
   After Hoff criticized Indonesian judges in the press, Hutapea
responded with a an open letter to judges and the news media
calling Hoff's comments insulting. Not long afterward, Hoff left
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want a foreign lawyer to mess around in my country,''
Hutapea said. ``I welcome them but they have to behave. They treat
Indonesia like a jungle.''

<P>
   CHICAGO _ Hate arrived in the neighborhoods of Indiana
University in Bloomington in the pre-dawn darkness of spring of
1998, as a criminal justice major named Benjamin Smith drove his
light blue Ford Taurus down residential streets, tossing little
plastic bags of pamphlets into yards.
</P>
<P>
   The brochures asserted that the white race was being crowded out
by Jews, blacks and the ``mud people,'' his derogatory term for
Asians.
</P>
<P>
   Hate apparently came again over the Independence Day weekend, as
August Smith _ no longer Benjamin, he told a journalist, because it
sounded too Jewish _ returned to his old haunts in Indiana and
Illinois. According to the police and FBI, the 21-year-old student
drove the same light blue Ford slowly, firing one handgun and then
another at Jews, blacks and Asians.
</P>
<P>
   The deadly visit to Bloomington on Sunday came near the end of a
three-day tear of violence in two states. Before it was over, two
men, one black and one Korean, were dead, both shot in the back,
and nine other Jews, Asians and blacks were wounded. It ended with
a suicide in rural southern Illinois late Sunday night, when Smith
stole a van and during a chase with police shot himself three
times, the last during a struggle with officers after the van
crashed, the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who encountered Ben Smith say they never saw him commit
racially motivated violence before last week, but they saw him
become more willing to express his racist views openly. The
locations of the shootings may not have been random, police and the
FBI say. Smith shot at Orthodox Jews, blacks and Asians on Friday
night in the northern suburbs of Chicago, where he grew up. Ricky
Byrdsong, 43, a former basketball coach at Northwestern University,
was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Saturday Smith shot at blacks and Asians near the
University of Illinois, where he quit before being expelled over
charges of domestic violence, possessing drugs and posting racist
literature.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday he returned to Bloomington, where he had just
completed his third year of college at Indiana University. There,
authorities say, he killed Won Joon Yoon, 26, a Korean-American man
at a church near the school, where Smith's one-man flurry of white
power pamphlets had scared the community into marching against hate
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Smith grew up in the affluent northern suburbs of Chicago, in
Wilmette and Northfield. Neighbors said his father is a doctor, his
mother a real estate agent and former town trustee. He has two
younger brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where he got his racist ideas, who knows?'' said Ruth Hanna, a
neighbor of the family for 16 years in Wilmette. ``There was no
indication it came from the family.''
</P>
<P>
   The quotation that Smith chose for his senior yearbook in 1996
at New Trier High School was ``Sic semper tyrannis,'' Latin for
``thus ever to tyrants,'' the same slogan spoken by John Wilkes
Booth after he shot Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Smith went to college that fall at the University of Illinois,
in Champaign-Urbana, at first in the school of agriculture,
consumer and environmental sciences. He lived in an elite
dormitory, Allen Hall, known for its progressive program of
visiting authors and artists of many cultures and points of view,
university officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last year with an alternative newspaper, Smith
said he had no racist views until he reached the university. He
said felt uncomfortable around so many foreign students and
professors. Then he started to read neo-Nazi literature and met
Matthew F. Hale, of East Peoria, Ill., who was recruiting on campus
for his World Church of the Creator, an anti-black, anti-Christian,
anti-Jewish organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he first met me he had mentioned violence,'' Hale said.
``And I said, `That's not the way to go, brother.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Smith came to the attention of the Illinois campus police in the
fall of his sophomore year. In a single week in October 1997, he
was accused of beating his girlfriend, Elizabeth Ann Sahr, in his
dorm room, then of possessing marijuana, then of fighting with
other students, university officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tried to keep his racism and his anti-Semitism hidden,''
Ms. Sahr said in a telephone interview. ``People really need to pay
more attention to domestic violence and racism.''
</P>
<P>
   In January 1998, because of the charges, Smith was placed on
probation and required to undergo counseling, to take an ethics
class and to perform community service, according to university
records.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days later, he was confronted about racist literature posted
in the dorm. ``He vehemently insisted on his First Amendment
rights, but didn't admit he had done it,'' said Bill Murphy,
associate chancellor for public affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The next month, there were more complaints against Smith:
peeking into dormitory windows, and unconfirmed reports that he had
acquired weapons, Murphy said. Then Smith filed his own complaint
with the school's office of conflict resolution, saying the
dormitory administration was mistreating him.
</P>
<P>
   A week before his disciplinary hearing on the latest charges,
university officials consulted with his parents, and Smith withdrew
from the university, signing a statement promising never to return.
``If he had not withdrawn, he would have been dismissed,'' Murphy
said.
</P>
<P>
   That summer of 1998, Smith enrolled at the University of
Indiana, in Bloomington, where he began publicly expressing racist
views. He switched from computer science to criminal justice,
joining a department known for its interest in crimes against
racial minorities. A recent symposium is suggestive of the
curriculum: ``Challenging Stereotypes and Encouraging Empathy in
the Criminal Justice Classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith soon was placing leaflets of the White Nationalist Party
on cars on campus. After a university official met with him, Smith
wrote a long letter as ``August Smith'' to the Indiana Daily
Student in June 1998 decrying the university's attempt to curb his
free speech rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was true that the fliers were racially-oriented,'' Smith
wrote, ``but to label them racist, bigoted or prejudiced
demonstrates bias.''
</P>
<P>
   He opposed the university's policy of affirmative action as
``racist,'' and called attention to facilities for nonwhite
students, such as the Black Student Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``But where do white people go to discuss their issues and
concerns? There is no White Student Union established to help white
students organize and react to the problems our people face. This
is why the White Nationalist Party was established.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Citing medical reasons, Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich withdrew
Monday as head coach of USA Basketball's 1999 men's senior national
team that will compete in the Olympic qualifying tournament July
14-25 in Puerto Rico.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Rudy is recovering from extreme physical exhaustion,'' said
Rockets team physician Jim Muntz. ``We have advised rest, and in
light of this he will not be able to coach the USA men's senior
national team in the pre-Olympic Tournament of the Americas.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich, complaining of dizziness and weakness, was checked
into Memorial Hospital by Muntz on Friday and released Sunday. But
Tomjanovich said Monday he simply wasn't yet up to the three-week
coaching stint that would be demanded by the USA national team,
which will have preliminary workouts this week in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed to say that I won't be able to fulfill
my obligation to USA Basketball,'' Tomjanovich said. ``It's really
a great honor and something I was looking forward to. But I've
overworked myself, and I find myself really physically and mentally
exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spent a couple of days in the hospital and conferred with
my doctor, and the prescription is three or four weeks of rest. I'm
really disappointed, and I'm going to do my best to recharge myself
and get ready for the upcoming season.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia 76ers coach Larry Brown was named to succeed
Tomjanovich as head coach of the national team, but Tomjanovich is
still scheduled to coach the Dream Team in the 2000 Olympics in
Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've not been given any indication by USA Basketball that
this will affect his (Tomjanovich's) status for 2000,'' said
Rockets spokesman Tim Frank, ``should the team qualify.''
</P>
<P>
   With a team that includes players like San Antonio's Tim Duncan,
Seattle's Gary Payton, Minnesota's Kevin Garnett and the Phoenix
tandem of Jason Kidd and Tom Gugliotta, the team is almost a sure
bet to qualify. The U.S. squad needs only to finish among the top
two teams at the qualifying tournament to get a bid to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich has been going nonstop for almost two years, the
leading contributor to his condition.
</P>
<P>
   After the Rockets were eliminated from the 1998 NBA playoffs,
Tomjanovich was supposed to lead a team of NBA stars in last
summer's World Championships of Basketball in Athens, Greece. When
the NBA players boycotted the tournament because of a
league-imposed lockout, Tomjanovich took a team composed of college
and Continental Basketball Association players and led them to a
bronze medal, even though most experts predicted Team USA would be
quickly eliminated from the competition.
</P>
<P>
   After taking home the bronze medal, Tomjanovich and his staff
returned to the uncertainty of the lockout, which was not resolved
until January. Tomjanovich was forced to put in long hours
preparing for the season, especially since the Rockets got involved
in trade talks concerning Scottie Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   The recent NBA draft and overtures from Toronto concerning
possibly trading for Hakeem Olajuwon meant even more work for
Tomjanovich and his staff. As a result, Tomjanovich removed himself
from the NBA's Select Committee, which was assembled to discuss and
analyze possible rules changes to speed up the game and increase
scoring. Tomjanovich did not attend last month's Select Committee
meeting in New York.
</P>
<P>
   And now he has removed himself from the USA national team.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said that after being named head coach, he immediately
called and got input from Tomjanovich on the offensive and
defensive sets he wanted to employ.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was first told about this possibility, I was hopeful
that Rudy would be back in a couple of days,'' Brown said. ``But
that's not the case. I'm shocked. I called him and got filled in on
the things he wanted to do. The way I'm looking at it is that I'm
just filling in until he gets back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted him to have as much input as possible. Really, I was
just looking forward to learning from Rudy. I always feel as though
I benefit from those situations like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sad. I was looking forward to being an assistant to Rudy
and learning a lot. This is tough. I'm just hoping he'll get well
and gets back real quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Those sentiments were echoed by USA Basketball executive
director Warren Brown, who announced the coaching change Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first thought is with Rudy and his quick recovery,'' Brown
said. ``We're extremely fortunate that this team has an outstanding
coaching staff, and we are confident that Larry, Gene (Keady) and
Tubby (Smith) will be able to guide this squad to an Olympic
qualifying berth.''

<P>
   By the Fourth of July weekend in 1998, Smith was openly placing
2,000 flyers under windshields in a wide area of Bloomington. The
text, from the World Church of the Creator, extolled the ``Great
White Race'' and assailed what it called ``a deceitful, alien
government, a controlled media, and a suicidal religion.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor of Bloomington, John Fernandez, encountered Smith
twice, at a rally and on a radio call-in show. ``All indications
were that he didn't have any history of violence,'' Fernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Smith began to give interviews. He offered his views on violence
to Lisa Sorg, managing editor of the Bloomington Independent, as
they sat in the Encore Cafi in Bloomington last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we can legally come to power through nonviolence,''
Smith said, ``but Hale says if they try to restrict our legal means
then we have no recourse but to resort to terrorism and violence.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had received death threats, but wasn't afraid. ``I'm
more afraid for my race than myself,'' he said. ``Nature isn't
concerned with the individual, but with the species.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he still spoke with his parents, but didn't have the
friends at home that he used to have. He calls his former friends
``race traitors.''
</P>
<P>
   While some members of the Church of the Creator wanted to
partition the nation into areas for different minorities, he told
Ms. Sorg that he wanted to expel racial and religious minorities.
``They won't be very happy to leave, but they'll probably end up
wanting to leave,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said his career goal was to be a lawyer. This spring he
testified for Hale, the World Church leader, who has tried
unsuccessfully to receive a law license in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sorg said that Smith came across as very calm, his voice
flat, his eyes dead. He seemed to have an almost reverential
devotion to Hale almost like a ``schoolgirl crush,'' she said.

   By November 1998, the community had decided to respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was civic pornography,'' said Jeffrey Willsey, an
organizer of a group called Bloomington United, that formed in
response to the leafletting. ``We felt that because it was in our
yards, and there was a clear attempt to psychologically intimidate
our community, it was important to respond to it.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Smith wrote again to the student paper in November, saying that
the community march did not prove that he was a minority of one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that there has been no massive rejection of the
World Church's materials or ideas,'' Smith wrote. ``The rally was
the product of a diverse gang of special interests groups, none of
which represent the silent white majority of the student body. Most
students do not want a ban of `hate speech.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He also said the pamphlets were not hateful. ``Being familiar
with the literature, I must argue that it is not so much `hate
literature' as much as truth that reflects poorly on nonwhites,''
Smith wrote. ``The World Church stands for free speech and open
dialogue and is willing to debate the issues at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   His writings and distribution of pamphlets sparked a campus
debate on tolerance. The anthropology faculty wrote a letter to the
editor to quarrel with some of the racial history in Smith's
pamphlets.
</P>
<P>
   Smith lived in Touchdown Terrace, a somewhat run-down, 30-unit
student apartment complex with many minority residents. His
neighbors said he glared at minorities but did not act violently.
His only difficulty was that someone kept breaking the windows of
his car and his apartment, as often as once a week, apparently in
retaliation for his writings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about Benjamin `August' Smith, the person in my Race
and Ethnicity class last semester,'' said Tyrese Alexander, 23, a
black student who lived a few doors down from Smith. ``But I had no
idea I was living next to him.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear what set off last week's violence, but Hale, the
World Church leader, believes that he knows. Hale's latest attempt
to become a lawyer in Illinois was rebuffed on Friday by a state
panel. Smith had testified for Hale at a hearing in April, praising
Hale's legal means.
</P>
<P>
   ``He testified that he might be in jail now if it wasn't for
me,'' Hale said. When asked if the adverse decision on Friday might
have sparked the killings, Hale said, ``I do. I very much do.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the accused killer is dead does not make
Bloomington feel safer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben Smith may have taken his own life, but there's still far
too much hatred out there, in the community, in the world,'' said
Rabbi Sue L. Shifron, a founder of Bloomington United.
</P>
<P>
   ``While he may be gone, the organization that he was a part of
and hundreds of other organizations are still out there.''

FRINGE PLAYERS DREAM OF BETTER DAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ These aren't the guys who grab the headlines. They
don't pull down the millions, bask in constant adulation, know the
easy road anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   They hang on by fingernails. They learn to get back up, to
persevere, to believe in themselves when no one else will.
</P>
<P>
   They're the last guys on the roster, carving out a role,
adjusting their dream. And playing major-league baseball into their
30s.
</P>
<P>
   Every baseball team has one, maybe more. Guys who have spent
seeming lifetimes in the minors, might have played in Japan or
Mexico, been with more organizations than they should have to
remember.
</P>
<P>
   They aren't the glory boys but the supporting players. They play
in the shadows, their tenuous careers always one unwanted phone
call away from another setback.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people say, `This guy's been in the minor leagues all
these years,' '' Anaheim Angels outfielder Reggie Williams said.
``You know what? I have been, but I've been playing baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be the same if I was playing up here the whole time.
The only difference is financial. Otherwise, I've had a great
career _ I've been playing.''
</P>
<P>
   As youngsters they dreamed of becoming superstars, or at least
starters in the majors. They emulated Reggie Jackson, Steve Garvey,
Nolan Ryan, Frank Robinson. Kids don't dream of one day becoming
Reggie Williams, but the major-league landscape is dotted with
career role players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the guy who had the dream,'' Los Angeles Dodgers
outfielder Trenidad Hubbard said. ``When I was growing up in
Chicago, I was Rick Monday and Jose Cardenal and Ernie Banks. I
knew that's what I wanted to do, play baseball in a big stadium. I
didn't know that for the most part, it's a struggle to get up here.
Sometimes an even harder struggle to stay there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard, 33, has been released, waived and traded. He's spent
almost 12 of his 14 years in professional baseball in the minor
leagues. It took him 8{ years before he got his first call to the
big leagues. In one three-year stretch, he was with four different
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never once considered giving it up, because the dream was
still alive,'' Hubbard said. ``I've rehearsed for these days for 8{
years. I try to enjoy every second I'm up here. I come out here
with a sense of awe from playing in the major leagues. My dream in
essence has come true. But I'm still dreaming it's going to get
better.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE CONSTANT DREAD
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Huson can laugh at it now. She had been at this a long
time to have been caught so off guard. The wife of Angels infielder
Jeff Huson can tell more hard-luck stories than she'd like to
admit. Jeff, 34, has been with seven different organizations, five
in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   But last season he had won a job in camp with the Mariners and
Wendy started making summer plans in the Northwest and Canada with
their three children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of had our lives planned for a change, but I should
have known better,'' Wendy said. ``Then he called and said, `I've
been released.'
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how many times it happens, your heart still kind of
drops. You get that pit in your stomach, because it's
disappointing. He's just worked so hard to stay in the big leagues.
For the last three spring trainings, he's gone as a nonroster
player, had to go out every single day and be at his peak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys that have been in the majors a long time or have
long-term contracts, they don't really understand that. Basically,
they're going to spring training to work out. But Jeff is having to
compete for a job, every single year. There's so much pressure on
him, I can feel that pressure, too. I try to keep things calm, but
sometimes it's very difficult. It's that uncertainty thing. That is
the hardest part. It's just not knowing what's going to happen with
our lives from year to year to year.''
</P>
<P>
   Their wives never know what the next phone call might bring.
They have to bounce around the country, too, suffer through the
constant highs and lows.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's fringe players have been knocked around throughout
their careers. Security just isn't part of the package. A summons
to the manager's office could be innocuous or life-changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want a manager to talk to you at your locker, not in the
office,'' Hubbard said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Huson has had his share of unwanted summons. And more than
once he has considered calling it a career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't count on one hand the times I said I'm not playing
anymore,'' he said. ``What really aggravates me is, people think
everyone is a millionaire. And that's not the case. They don't
realize how hard it is sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of four seasons in the early '90s, Huson was the
starting shortstop with the Rangers. Then came a series of
injuries. He spent all of 1993 in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally in '94, after a series of injuries _ rotator-cuff
tear, knee surgery, toe surgery, you-name-it surgery _ I got
released,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He signed with the Orioles in the offseason but couldn't make
their roster out of spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ended up spending about three months in the minor leagues
and was really starting to get frustrated,'' Wendy said. ``Then he
got the phone call _ he got called up again.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really turned things around. It gave him hope that, `Yes,
I can still do this. Somebody still has faith in me.' I can
remember very distinctly that phone call, where he's like, `I got
called up again. We're going to be fine.' '' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
A DIFFERENT ROAD
</P>
<P>
   Every player who has made a career out of being one of the last
guys on the roster can look back and remember a moment in their
careers with unwanted clarity. Whether it then felt like a slight
detour or a momentous career turn, it now feels very fresh.
</P>
<P>
   Texas infielder Jon Shave made it to the majors in his fourth
season. He was hitting .319 when invited into the manager's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the first time I was sent down,'' Shave said. ``I
had come up and done a very good job. It just so happens, somebody
comes off the DL and there goes my spot. At that time I was 24, and
it was a lot easier to accept, because you think you're going to
come back. It took me probably five years to come back.'' When
Shave finally made it back last season, it was with Minnesota. Then
the Twins waived him in the offseason. He was claimed by the
Rangers and has been with them all this season, though he knows it
could all change in an instant.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's always in the back of your mind a little bit,'' Shave
said. ``But at the same time, I've had a lot of things happen in my
life, where that wouldn't be do or die. I mean, this game is great,
it's my livelihood, but believe me, life would go on. ``I've had a
number of injuries, I've been through a divorce, I've had family
members die. Things like that make you realize, and as you get
older, that this game is not the most important thing in the world
and it makes it easier to deal with.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
A SUCCESS STORY
</P>
<P>
   A tiny percentage of players spend an eternity in the minors and
then become regulars in the majors. Maury Wills did it with the
Dodgers in the '60s. Reliever Billy Taylor spent 14 years in the
minor leagues with 11 different organizations before making it to
the majors and becoming the closer for the A's.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Stevens had taken his own circuitous route to success.
Stevens was once a No. 1 draft pick of the Angels, but by 1996 he
had been released by three different teams, spent two years playing
in Japan and seemed far from achieving major-league success when he
agreed to play for the Rangers' Triple-A team in Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never got me down,'' Stevens said. ``I was still playing
the game. That's all I ever wanted to do, was to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never once did it cross my mind to stop playing. I knew if I
kept playing, eventually it would come together. And that's
basically what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The first baseman hit 32 home runs for Oklahoma City and in 1997
became the Rangers' regular first baseman. He hit more than 20
homers in each of the past two seasons for Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been lucky, in a roundabout, up-and-down way,'' Stevens
said. ``I think that makes it more rewarding. I've been through
every emotional roadblock, physical roadblock. I've been to the
bottom and everywhere in between. Everywhere from playing
absolutely terrible baseball, to last year being in the clubhouse
with these guys celebrating the Western championship.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE LIMELIGHT'S CALL
</P>
<P>
   Williams was never anyone's No. 1 draft pick. He was taken on
the 25th round by the Giants. He's played in an independent league
in Idaho and for Monterey in the Mexican League.
</P>
<P>
   ``I slept in a hotel where the room didn't have a window,''
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Huson had to walk on to his JC team in Arizona. He never was
drafted. He was first signed by Montreal out of a semipro league.
He worked one offseason for the Expos' Single-A team in West Palm
Beach, Fla., answering the phones and selling tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, Huson, Hubbard, Shave, and countless more like them
have had to fight for every small opportunity. Their adulthood has
been a constant battle to keep their careers alive.
</P>
<P>
   They could have chosen a career path with a more traditional
lifestyle _ two of Huson's brothers and a sister-in-law are
accountants _ but none has any second thoughts. No matter if
they're not household names and millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to let anyone upset my joy at being blessed to
play in the major leagues,'' Williams said. ``A lot of people would
give their left arm to be in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, everybody can't be a star, everybody can't be a home run
hitter, everybody can't be a base stealer. You have to find the
happiness in being here, which I find all the time. It's easy for
me _ I love to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to belong somewhere. You're not looking for money.
You just kind of want a home.'''
</P>
<P>
   These players make adjustments. They downsize their ambition. If
they still believe they could be effective everyday players, they
learn to fill a role _ a switch hitter off the bench, defensive
replacement, spot starter. Maybe it's not the original dream, but
it's still playing at a rare level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't look at my career as disappointing,'' Shave said.
``There are a lot of people who had to settle for this. In our
situation, I obviously feel very good being part of a team. And I
do have a role. It might not be called upon a lot, but I do have a
role, and that's fine with me.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something I grew up my whole life wanting to do. I'm
playing baseball in the major leagues. I wouldn't trade it for
anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a good life and I'm sure it's said all the time, but I
honestly, sincerely mean it when I say, I don't play this for the
money. I swear I don't. I'd play for no money.''
