	   PARIS (AP) _ France went happily wild Thursday, celebrating a
soccer victory that puts its team up against Brazil in the World
Cup final and lifts a flagging national spirit with fresh pride. No
one remembered such an outburst since Liberation in 1945.
	   ``We're going to the finals,'' Serge Garnier shouted, leaping
for joy with three retirement-age friends after France beat
Croatia, 2-1. ``I've been waiting for this for 40 years. My
reaction? Ah-la-la-la-la.''
	   During the match Wednesday night, a cannon could have been fired
down the Champs Elysees without risking French lives. Almost
everyone not at the 80,000-seat Stade de France was somewhere in
front of a television set.
	   Within minutes of the ending whistle, people on foot poured onto
the Champs Elysees from all directions. By early Thursday, police
estimated the crowd at 350,000. Many others cruised Paris hanging
out of car windows, sitting on hoods, and leaning on horns.
	   A policeman named Daniel grabbed a rubber traffic cone and used
it as a megaphone to bellow, ``We won, we won. We'll be in the
final.'' Children danced atop bus stop shelters. Others hoisted
girlfriends onto shoulders to wild cheers.
	   In the Madrigal Cafe on the Champs Elysees, someone chanted,
``If you're proud to be French, clap your hands,'' and provoked a
deafening response. Then everyone sang a moist-eyed ``La
Marseillaise,'' the French national anthem.
	   Reaction was similar in cities and towns all over France.
	   Marco Haye closed down his Michelin-star La Fontaine restaurant
in the Provence village of Ampus. ``I didn't think anyone would
come, and, besides, I love soccer,'' he said. ``It was a terrific
victory for us.''
	   A fierce mistral wind forced village authorities to take down a
large screen set up in the square, but no one missed the game.
Honking cars choked the few cobblestone streets.
	   Peron Restaurant, a Marseille bouillabaisse temple with strong
traditions, brought in two television sets for the first time ever.
Roland Frittoli, the owner, had planned to leave off the sound but
was outvoted by the clientele.
	   Frenchmen organized the first World Cup in 1932, but despite
three semi-final games, France has never got beyond third place.
This year, as hosts of the biggest tournament ever, the French now
face everyone's dream opponent: Brazil.
	   The triumph caused many Frenchmen to forget for a while the
nation's racial divisions and growing problem of restive immigrant
suburbs. Thousands of youths came in by train from ``sensitive
neighborhoods'' to celebrate in downtown Paris.
	   Zinedane Zidane, the team's hero, is a Marseille kid, the son of
an Algerian night watchman. In the middle of Paris, North African
youths with Zidane dreams played post-game soccer with a crushed
beer can as a ball.
	   The popular chant, ``Thuram President,'' referred to Lilian
Thuram, a black Frenchman from the Caribbean island of Guadaloupe
who scored both French goals.
	   ``This will do a great deal of good for the suburbs,'' said
Abdullah Merrouche, 69, an Algerian-born doctor with French
citizenship, who left the stadium with a wide grin. ``Kids have a
role model, and Le Pen looks like a fool.''
	   Jean-Marie Le Pen heads the extreme-right National Front,
labeled ``racist and xenophobic'' by President Jacques Chirac.
France showed a different image to billions of worldwide TV viewers
as white teammate Laurent Blanc tenderly embraced Thuram.
	   But that was only part of it. This was glory. The jubilation was
universal from the men in dark suits and silk ties in the VIP boxes
at the bright new stadium to impoverished workers who cheered each
French advance in front of their TV sets at home.
	   ``We're going to show the world who we are,'' said Thierry
Menetrier, whose face was thickly painted with blue, white and red.
``The Brazilians are good, but they've had their chance. Now it
will be France.''
	   Serge Garnier and his friends agreed. Brazil was masterful, but
France was finally on a roll.
	   ``We really showed our weight tonight,'' Garnier said. ``I'm
only sorry it wasn't the Germans. It would have been like winning
another war against them.''

Communist Party expels big city vice mayor for corruption
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A big city vice mayor, jailed on corruption
charges he claims were fabricated, has been expelled from the
Communist Party, state media reported Thursday.
	   The party's internal watchdog agency, in a circular printed in
most major dailies, said Harbin Vice Mayor Zhu Shengwen ``traded
power for money,'' taking 330,000 yuan (dlrs 40,000) in bribes and
amassing 600,000 yuan (dlrs 72,000) from unclear sources.
	   Zhu's expulsion was expected. The party, through the
state-controlled media, has sought to publicize his arrest and
conviction as proof it is battling pervasive official corruption.
	   But Zhu startled investigators and court judges by declaring at
his December trial that he had been framed and then tortured by
investigators into confessing, according to a statement by
London-based Amnesty International obtained from his family.
	   Zhu told the court he found that fellow Vice Mayor Yue Yuquan
had misused 20 million yuan (dlrs 2.4 million) in social insurance
funds in 1996 and that Yue, in charge of law enforcement in Harbin,
used his connections to take revenge, the Amnesty International
transcript said.
	   None of Zhu's allegations appeared in state-run media. But the
Intermediate People's Court in Harbin recessed for four months
without any public explanation. The court resumed work in April,
and the judges convicted and sentenced Zhu to life in prison.
	   Public anger over official corruption threatens to undermine the
last of the party's frayed legitimacy. In cities like Harbin,
capital of northeasternmost Heilongjiang province and a former
center of heavy industry, resentment has sharpened as state
enterprises lay off workers to cope with market reforms.
	   In approving Zhu's expulsion, the party's Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection called on officials to take the case as an
example and resist temptation.
	   ``Whether one can serve the public and government cleanly faced
with the lure of money and all types of material benefit is the
severe test of every leading cadre,'' the People's Daily quoted the
circular as saying.

Philippine car sales plunge 51 percent in first half of 1998
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Sales of passenger cars in the
Philippines fell sharply in the first half of 1998 as a result of
Asia's currency crisis and tighter credit policies, an industry
group said Thursday.
	   The Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers of the Philippines Inc.
said car sales from January to June plunged 51 percent from the
same period last year to 20,036.
	   In June alone, sales fell 57 percent year-on-year to 2,888, it
said.
	   In addition to the effects of the currency crisis and credit
crunch, the association said more car repossessions by banks and
financing companies have increased the number of used cars
available and turned buyers away from new vehicles.
	   The association said it may further cut its car sales target for
the year, which now stands at 51,000, because of the
deeper-than-expected decline in sales in the first half.
	   The industry sold 75,707 passengers cars last year.

Bad weather worsening North Korean food problem
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Drought, tidal waves and cold weather
have again limited crop production in famine-stricken North Korea,
the communist state's official news agency reported Thursday.
	   The Korean Central News Agency said the early planting season
was marked by drought, while tidal wives and a cold spell damaged
crops along the eastern coast and in the interior in June.
	   ``So the harvest of early crops, including potato, barley and
wheat, cannot be expected,'' KCNA said.
	   ``This year, too, therefore, the shortage of food remains a
difficult problem,'' it said. ``An increasing number of households
are running short of food.''
	   North Korea said families were reducing their already meager
meals and ``tapping all possibilities and reserves and eking out
their living in reliance upon substitute food.''
	   This week, the Catholic relief group Caritas reported that a
lack of food has forced many North Koreans to scrounge for anything
to eat, including grass, bark and roots.
	   As a result, hospitals were reporting a sharp increase in
diarrhea, stomach ailments and other digestive problems, said
Caritas official Kathi Zellweger. She spoke to reporters in Beijing
on Tuesday after a weeklong trip to North Korea.
	   Severe floods devastated North Korea's farm production in
1995-96. A prolonged drought laid waste to one-third of its
farmland in 1997.
	   The U.N. World Food Program says North Korea will need another
500,000 tons of food aid this year in addition to what already has
been pledged.
	   The Rome-based agency urged donor nations and agencies to ensure
that food aid pledged _ some 800,000 tons _ arrives before the next
harvest in October.
	   North Korean officials, working with U.N. experts, have
estimated that at least dlrs 300 million in aid would be needed for
each of the next three years.

Olympic multi-medalist suspended after testing positive for
</HEADLINE>
marijuana &QL; 
 &UR; By BOB BAUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHOENIX (AP) _ Gary Hall Jr., winner of two gold and two silver
medals in the 1996 Olympics, has been suspended from competition by
the international swimming federation for a positive marijuana
test.
	   Hall, 23, who lives in Phoenix, issued a statement Wednesday
saying he would fight the allegation but would be unable to compete
in this month's Goodwill Games in New York. Hall plans to undergo a
second test next week in the International Olympic Committee's
laboratory in Montreal.
	   If that test also is positive, FINA, the sport's international
governing body, would determine the length of the suspension.
	   The current suspension, announced in FINA's newsletter, is
provisional pending the outcome of the second test and a hearing
before the organization's doping panel.
	   ``I am confident that once I am afforded the opportunity to
present my position, I will be able to prove I did not violate any
FINA rule and the provisional suspension will be removed,'' Hall
said in a statement released by his agent.
	   Four Chinese swimmers were provisionally suspended for testing
positive for masking agents during last year's world championships,
but the suspension was lifted after they argued in a hearing that
they had used only traditional Chinese herbs that had caused the
positive test results.
	   Hall was in Hawaii and unavailable for comment. But Phil
Whitten, a spokesman for Hall, said the swimmer was ``very, very
upset,'' especially because of the ramifications the suspension
could have.
	   If Hall still is on suspension in August, and if the U.S.
championships that month are considered an international meet by
FINA, he would be banned from that competition.
	   The August championships will determine most of the U.S. roster
for 1999 international competition. However, rules could allow Hall
to be added to the U.S. contingent later.
	   Hall won gold medals as part of the U.S. 400-meter freestyle and
400-meter medley relay teams in the Atlanta Games. He also won
silver medals in the 50- and 100-meter freestyle.
	   According to Hall's statement, the positive test came in a
non-FINA sanctioned event May 15 in Phoenix.
	   FINA added marijuana to its banned substance list last year.
Hall noted in his statement that marijuana is a ``non-performance
enhancing substance.''
	   Whitten said only one swimmer, Scott Miller of Australia, has
been suspended for marijuana use. Miller, silver medalist in the
100-meter butterfly at Atlanta, was suspended for two months early
this year.
	   Charlie Snyder, spokesman for U.S. Swimming, said the federation
would have no comment because the second test and hearing have yet
to be conducted.

South Korea to sell patrol boats to Qatar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korean defense contractors are
close to bartering six military patrol boats to Qatar for more than
dlrs 200 million in liquefied petroleum gas, officials said
Thursday.
	   ``Both sides have come to an understanding on the barter
proposal,'' a Defense Ministry official said, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
	   South Korea imports 80 percent of its liquefied petroleum gas
needs from Qatar, a Gulf country.
	   Officials at Daewoo and Hyundai refused to discuss the deal,
which would be worth three times South Korea's total weapons
exports last year.
	   Daewoo recently won a dlrs 100 million contract to build a
2,300-ton frigate for the Bangladesh navy, according to domestic
news media. Hyundai sold a naval patrol ship to Bangladesh in 1995.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Turkish Airlines flight en route to Japan was hit
by severe air turbulence four hours after taking off from Istanbul,
slightly injuring 6 Japanese passengers, airport officials said
Thursday.
	   The Airbus A340 plane landed safely at about 8:30 a.m. Thursday
(2330 GMT Wednesday) at Tokyo's Narita Airport, said airport
spokesman Toshiaki Nohara. It carried 186 passengers.
	   The injured were escorted to an airport clinic for treatment and
then released, he said.
	   Flight 1022, which departed Istanbul on Wednesday, experienced
the turbulence while flying above the Ural Mountains in Russia, but
the pilot did not report the incident until arrival in Tokyo, the
spokesman said.

Australian June jobs data show economy holding up well
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Economists are encouraged by a larger
than expected rise in employment in June and say it indicates the
Australian economy is weathering the impact from the economic slump
in Asia quite well.
	   The Bureau of Statistics on Thursday said employment rose by
20,200 in June, above economists' forecasts for a seasonally
adjusted increase of 10,000.
	   While the unemployment rate rose to 8.2 percent from 8.1 percent
in May, the participation rate, or proportion of adults either
working or actively seeking work, rose to 63.4 percent, from 63.2
percent. Economists had expected unchanged unemployment and
participation rates.
	   ``And despite the downturn in Asia, there is still great
resilience and vigor in the labor market in Australia, and a
further twenty-odd thousand jobs created last month is very good
news indeed,'' Prime Minister John Howard said.
	   Howard's government won a national election in March 1996 after
13 years in opposition.
	   ``While sentiment and confidence surveys point to weakness, that
isn't filtering through into hard numbers,'' said Anthony Thompson,
senior economist at HSBC Markets Australia Ltd.
	   An index of consumer sentiment compiled by Westpac Banking Corp.
and Melbourne Institute fell 6.9 percent in June.
	   Also, a quarterly survey of business expectations published by
the Bureau of Statistics at the end of June showed businesses
expected a 0.1 percent fall in employment in the second quarter of
1998, followed by a 0.7 percent drop in the third quarter.
	   ``Given 60 percent of our exports go to the (Asian) region and
much of our tourism comes from there, the Australian economy is
probably riding out (the Asian crisis) better than originally
expected,'' said Colonial State Bank's chief economist Craig James.
	   The latest figures show the government roughly met its forecast
on unemployment for last fiscal year, which ended June 30, 1998,
despite the fallout from the slump in the Asian economies.
	   The government forecast that unemployment would average 8.25
percent over 1997-98. Thursday's data show an average unemployment
rate of 8.3 percent over the year.

Drug dealers executed in Shanghai

	   BEIJING (AP) _ At least five people convicted of selling heroin
in Shanghai have been executed, a Shanghai newspaper reported.
	   The Xinmin Evening News on Wednesday gave details about five
people found guilty of drug dealing in the Second Intermediate
People's Court and executed on Tuesday, but indicated that an
unspecified number of others also were executed.
	   Police who arrested the five in separate cases seized amounts of
heroin ranging from 1.3 kilograms (2.9 pounds) to 215 grams (7.5
ounces), the report said.
	   The court also sentenced to death Yao Chunlong for an attack
that killed an official and seriously injured his wife. The
newspaper did not elaborate on the crime.

Philippine kidnappers free wrong victims after apologizing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Kidnappers apologized and released
two girls after realizing they were the wrong victims, police said
Thursday.
	   Police said the girls were on their way to school in Manila's
Tondo district in their family's newly purchased secondhand car
when they were kidnapped Tuesday by two armed men. Their family
driver was also taken.
	   The kidnappers showed the girls pictures of a Chinese man who
was their target, but the girls denied knowing the man and showed
their identification cards to prove they were not related to him,
police said.
	   Realizing their mistake, the men abandoned the two girls and the
driver in Manila's Santa Cruz district and fled on foot.
	   ``It was a clear case of mistaken identity,'' said Inspector
Jaime Cruz. ``The men even said `sorry' to the victims.''
	   Cruz said the intended target was actually the car's previous
owner. Police provided security to the man, who owns a hardware
store in nearby Pasay City, following the failed kidnap attempt.
	   Kidnapping for ransom is a thriving criminal activity in the
Philippines. Most victims belong to the wealthy Chinese-Filipino
minority.
	   New President Joseph Estrada, who was inaugurated June 30, has
promised to wage a stronger war against crime and control
kidnappings within six months.

Japanese bank target of emergency inspection: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's newly-established financial industry
watchdog agency will carry out an emergency inspection of the
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd., a local report said Thursday.
	   The inspection, to be conducted as soon as next week, would be
the first of a series of probes into the financial health of
Japan's top 19 banking institutions, Kyodo News reported.
	   A Financial Supervision Agency spokesman was unavailable for
immediate comment.
	   The troubled Long-Term Credit Bank, saddled with a massive load
of bad loans, has begun negotiations with suitor Sumitomo Trust and
Banking Co. about an expected merger.
	   The watchdog agency, set up last month, has assumed inspection
and other financial industry oversight duties once the domain of
Japan's powerful, but scandal-tainted Finance Ministry.

Bad weather worsening North Korean food problem
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATEs with China completing food shipment in 12th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Drought, tidal waves and cold weather
have again limited crop production in famine-stricken North Korea,
the communist state's official news agency reported Thursday.
	   The Korean Central News Agency said the early planting season
was marked by drought, while tidal wives and a cold spell damaged
crops along the eastern coast and in the interior in June.
	   ``So the harvest of early crops, including potato, barley and
wheat, cannot be expected,'' KCNA said.
	   ``This year, too, therefore, the shortage of food remains a
difficult problem,'' it said. ``An increasing number of households
are running short of food.''
	   North Korea said families were reducing their already meager
meals and ``tapping all possibilities and reserves and eking out
their living in reliance upon substitute food.''
	   This week, the Catholic relief group Caritas reported that a
lack of food has forced many North Koreans to scrounge for anything
to eat, including grass, bark and roots.
	   As a result, hospitals were reporting a sharp increase in
diarrhea, stomach ailments and other digestive problems, said
Caritas official Kathi Zellweger. She spoke to reporters in Beijing
Tuesday after a weeklong trip to North Korea.
	   Severe floods devastated North Korea's farm production in
1995-96. A prolonged drought laid waste to one-third of its
farmland in 1997.
	   The U.N. World Food Program says North Korea will need another
500,000 tons of food aid this year in addition to what already has
been pledged.
	   The Rome-based agency urged donor nations and agencies to ensure
that food aid pledged _ some 800,000 tons _ arrives before the next
harvest in October.
	   North Korean officials, working with U.N. experts, have
estimated that at least dlrs 300 million in aid would be needed for
each of the next three years.
	   Also Thursday, North Korea said China has completed shipping
100,000 tons of food and 20,000 tons of fertilizer in free
assistance that its communist ally had promised in April.

Prince William meets Camilla Parker Bowles for the first time
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prince William last month had his first meeting
with Camilla Parker Bowles, the woman whom Princess Diana blamed
for the failure of her marriage, a tabloid newspaper reported
Thursday.
	   The Sun reported that the June 12 meeting happened by chance
when the young prince came home to St. James's Palace unexpectedly
to change clothes before going out to see friends.
	   The meeting _ with 16-year-old William, Parker Bowles and Prince
Charles present _ was said to be amicable, mainly consisting of
small-talk and lasting about half-an-hour, the Sun said.
	   Parker Bowles is believed to have been Prince Charles' mistress
for at least the last 20 years. While Princess Diana was alive, he
reportedly made great efforts to keep the boys away from her.
	   A spokeswoman for Prince Charles, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity, confirmed to the paper that the meeting had
taken place. But she added that any meetings between William and
his younger brother, Prince Harry, and their father's longtime
partner were ``a private family matter.''
	   The Sun, renowned for its royal contacts, said Prince William
has met with Parker Bowles twice since the initial contact _ once
for tea and once for lunch _ and 13-year-old Prince Harry also will
meet Parker Bowles soon, if he desires.
	   Before her death 10 months ago, Princess Diana had blamed the
50-year-old Parker Bowles for the failure of her marriage, saying
in a 1995 interview before her divorce that there had always been
three people in the marriage.
	   After Diana was killed Aug. 31 in a high-speed car crash in
Paris with photographers tailing, Britain's tabloid media were
widely attacked for their relentless pursuit of her and promised to
help guard the privacy of her sons.
	   Royal spokespersons have made repeated appeals for the media to
honor that promise as stories chronicling everything from Prince
William's 16th birthday to Prince Harry's trip to France with his
father to watch the World Cup soccer tournament have appeared.
	   In a lead editorial, The Sun said it does respect the princes'
privacy but decided to publish the story in the public interest.
	   ``Our readers have a right to know that Charles, Camilla and
William have finally got together,'' the newspaper said. ``But
let's make one thing clear: Having published the story _ the Prince
of Wales and his children now need the privacy any family needs to
grow and develop. We will be giving them the space to do that.''

Exports falter as China heads for WTO talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Further marking an economic slowdown, exports _ a
driving force in China's economy _ rose a sluggish 7.6 percent
during the first half of the year, state media reported Thursday.
	   The anemic export growth underscores China's vulnerability to
Asia's lingering financial turmoil and could strengthen Chinese
resistance to making market-opening concessions at World Trade
Organization talks later this month.
	   While six-month exports totaled dlrs 86.97 billion, the 7.6
percent growth rate over the same period a year ago pales next to
the 21 percent posted for all of 1997. The rate also indicated a
dim June. Exports grew 8.6 percent in the first five months of the
year.
	   Imports rose 2.2 percent during the first half of the year to
dlrs 64.43 billion, leaving China with a dlrs 22.25 billion trade
surplus, according to customs figures released by the Xinhua News
Agency.
	   Declining exports make it more difficult for Chinese leaders to
meet their target for 8 percent economic growth this year. The
threshold is seen as critical to creating new jobs and staving off
unrest among millions of workers being laid off from inefficient,
bankrupt state industries.
	   Government economists have listed exports, along with consumer
spending and investment, as the crucial ingredients for growth.
	   Consumers, worried about layoffs, have so far been impervious to
five interest rate cuts in two years, the last on July 1.
Economists believe a massive public works program now being put in
place has come too late to significantly boost growth this year.
	   Adopting higher tax rebates, increased financing and other
measure taken to spur exports will also have difficulty achieving
results given continued economic woes in the region, especially in
Japan, a key investor and export market.
	   The grim export news came as Chinese negotiators headed Thursday
for Geneva to further China's 12-year bid to join the World Trade
Organization. The official China Daily quoted an unidentified
negotiator as calling on trading partners to be ``flexible'' in
negotiating China's membership.
	   The United States and other major western traders have refused
to let China into the rule-making body unless Beijing opens its
markets wider.
	   China Daily quoted the trade official as saying China could not
open its relatively new service sector as requested because
domestic companies would be destroyed by foreign competitors.

Philippine stocks fall, peso declines on weaker yen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks were hounded
Thursday by profit-taking as the market grappled for a better
handle on developments in Japan, traders said.
	   The peso, meanwhile, fell against the U.S. dollar as the weaker
Japanese yen pulled down currencies in the region, dealers said.
	   The dollar averaged 41.659 pesos in morning trading, compared to
41.397 pesos on Wednesday. Banks were building up dollar positions
in response to the yen's weakening, a trader with a foreign bank
said.
	   In stock trading, the 30-issue Philippine Stock Exchange Index
fell 29.10 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,828.40 after inching down
2.82 points Wednesday.
	   The broader All Shares Index fell 6.69 points to 570.0 following
a marginal 0.02-point gain on Wednesday. Losers beat gainers 60 to
28, with 39 issues unchanged.
	   ``What we saw was profit-taking,'' said Jose Vistan Jr., analyst
for Dharmala Securities.
	   He said investors were ``trying to see a clearer direction for
the region'' given the latest announcement of tax cuts in Japan.
Japan's upcoming elections will probably provide a better picture
of where the region's largest economy is headed, he said.
	   Trisha Jocson, analyst for Kim Eng Securities, said the market
ignored the gains posted overnight by the Dow Jones Industrial
Average and focused more on news emanating from the region.
	   Vistan said Japan will continue to be a major factor in the
market's direction given that corporate earnings are bound to be
disappointing.

Indonesian president delivers grim message at party congress

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - Opening a ruling party congress,
President B.J. Habibie said Thursday that government policies
designed to revive the sluggish economy had failed to yield gains.
	   In a pessimistic address to Golkar Party delegates, Habibie said
the yearlong financial crisis that has stripped millions of people
of their jobs shows no signs of abating.
	   ``The policies that have been taken by the government haven't
been able to bring around concrete results,'' he said. ``The rupiah
exchange rate is still low, industry hasn't recovered and
Indonesian financial markets are still lackluster.''
	   Under the tutelage of the International Monetary Fund, Indonesia
has been opening up its economy, dumping monopolies and
restructuring banks, in exchange for billions of dollars in loans.
	   However, protests and riots that led to the ouster of President
Suharto in May stalled the rescue package and scared off investors.
Many fear more social unrest as the economic burden on poor
Indonesians deepens.
	   Habibie has pledged democratic reform in a bid to shed the
authoritarian legacy of Suharto, who used Golkar as a vehicle to
back his edicts and steer his largely ceremonial election through a
special assembly for seven, five-year terms.
	   The tarnished party is trying to redefine its role, and party
chairman Harmoko urged hundreds of delegates at a five-star hotel
to make Golkar more democratic.
	   ``It's not a shame to acknowledge the weaknesses and mistakes of
the past. In the era of reform, we have to improve,'' said Harmoko,
who is likely to be replaced during the three-day congress.
	   Outside the hotel, several hundred protesters gathered with
banners to denounce Habibie and declare that Golkar's era was over.
Police and soldiers stood by, but the rally was peaceful.
	   ``Golkar is dead. Why have a congress?'' read one banner.
	   Golkar officials are expected to dissolve a leadership council
headed by Suharto, who is still technically the party's chief
patron.
	   Two of his children, eldest daughter Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana and
second son Bambang Trihatmodjo, hold leadership roles in the party.
	   Habibie has announced that he will hold general elections next
year, which could threaten Golkar's majority in the 500-seat
Parliament for the first time in decades.

Refugees and immigrants appealing deportation to be banned from
</HEADLINE>
work

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Would-be immigrants and refugees
appealing deportation orders will be banned from working in
Australia while their cases are before the courts.
	   The ban is imposed in new regulations adopted by Parliament last
week at the behest of Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock.
	   The government has defended the changes, saying too many people
were abusing the law to delay deportation and therefore should not
be given the incentive of being able to work.
	   A spokesman for Ruddock said protection visa applications had
jumped from 500 a year in the late 1980s to about 11,000 a year
now.
	   ``People, in many instances, were using it as a means of
delaying their departure from Australia and and in some cases being
allowed to work in the interim was facilitating that abuse,'' the
spokesman said.
	   People can have their cases reviewed by the Immigration
Department, the Refugee Review Tribunal or the Administrative
Appeals Tribunal, the Federal Court, the full bench of the Federal
Court, and the High Court.
	   Under the new regulations, people appealing a deportation must
not engage in employment.
	   The regulations will also force some people to face an English
language test rather than simply provide a certificate that they
can speak enough English to gain a visa.
	   Sydney immigration law specialist Michael Jones, of the legal
firm Parish Patience, said he and others in the field were lobbying
hard to try to have the regulations disallowed.
	   ``They have the potential to cause serious exploitation of
people who would be forced to work illegally while waiting for
months, in some cases years, for their cases to be heard,'' Jones
said.
	   ``No doubt there will be sexual and other harassment, and in
some states these people wouldn't be eligible for insurance or
workers' compensation if injured.
	   ``And, of course, there is a serious problem where the family
breadwinner is a foreign citizen with an Australian spouse or
children but won't be able to work to support them,'' he said.
	   A spokesman for the Australia-East Timor Association, Andrew
McNaughton, said the new regulations would affect hundreds of East
Timorese asylum seekers: ``Some asylum seekers will not be able to
survive. It seems to be a starve-them-out tactic.''

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Many Nigerians had hoped they would soon
witness the release of Moshood Abiola. Instead, they have taken to
the streets in anger over the death of the imprisoned opposition
leader, sparking riots that killed at least 19 people.
	   Abiola, Nigeria's most prominent political prisoner and the
presumed winner of 1993 elections that were annulled by Nigeria's
junta, died on Tuesday. The death _ and the widespread suspicion on
the streets that Abiola had been killed _ sparked rioting in parts
of three southwestern cities that was not quieted until Wednesday
evening.
	   On Wednesday, Nigeria's new military leader added to the
tumultuous situation by dissolving his Cabinet. However, Gen.
Abdulsalam Abubakar left untouched the country's Provisional Ruling
Council, the core of the junta that rules this oil-rich but
poverty-wracked nation.

Holocaust survivors appalled by publication of rightist party's
</HEADLINE>
membership list

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Holocaust survivors on Thursday
expressed their dismay at a Jewish magazine's decision to publish a
list of the names and suburbs of a right wing party's members,
saying that Jews of all people would not appreciate ``lists.''
	   Marika Weinberger, a survivor of the Auschwitz death camp and
president of the Australian Jewish Holocaust Survivors, said she
was very distressed by the publication.
	   ``The countries we have come from, those of us who survived,
came to Australia because privacy was something we cherished and
didn't have,'' Weinberger said.
	   ``We know the implications of what happens when lists, any
lists, are published and handed over to people.''
	   The decision by The Australia-Israel Review, a private
pro-Israeli publication, to publish the list of 2,000 members of
the right-wing populist One Nation party has split the
100,000-strong Jewish community.
	   While all opposed the principles of One Nation, some said the
publication was undemocratic and would cause an unnecessary and
possibly violent backlash against the Jewish community.
	   But publisher Mark Leibler defended the decision, although he
confirmed no more names would be published as originally promised.
	   The magazine said the list was provided by senior One Nation
figures dissatisfied with the control wielded by director David
Ettridge and party founder Pauline Hanson's adviser, David
Oldfield.
	   The Australian Jewish News, the country's largest Jewish
newspaper, has been inundated with phone calls.
	   When asked if it could cause a violent backlash, the newspaper's
associate editor, David Bernstein, replied: ``I don't know. I would
hope not but it could.
	   ``I just wonder if they considered before they put it out the
kind of backlash it's unleashed in the press which has made many
Jews, including many Holocaust survivors, feel very
uncomfortable,'' he said.
	   Jewish News editor Vic Alhadeff said many were concerned about
the media coverage, particularly the Sydney tabloid Daily
Telegraph's front page photo of neo-Nazis giving the Heil Hitler
salute.
	   ``There has been an unfortunate reaction in drawing comparisons
with Nazis. Obviously the circumstances are hugely different and
it's also drawn extremists out of the woodwork,'' he said.
	   ``What is also disturbing is many people see the Jewish
community as one homogeneous entity.
	   ``We have pointed out the Review is a private organization which
publishes no more than a few hundred copies and does not speak for
the organized Australian community.''
	   But Peter Wertheim, acting president of the Executive Council of
Australian Jewry, Australia's peak Jewish body, said he supported
the magazine's decision.
	   ``I don't believe that the people whose names have been
published are likely to be targeted, anyway, and the only thing
they are likely to suffer is embarrassment,'' he said.
	   Oldfield, One Nation's spokesman, said the publication was
disgraceful.
	   ``I am sure that everywhere there are decent members of the
Jewish community who are mortified at the persecution, at the
potential vilification which has been created by the
Australia-Israel Review.
	   ``Our members have an expectation and a right to their privacy,
the same as the members of any organization, and that in particular
it would be members of the Jewish community that would perpetrate
such a crime as publishing a private membership list would seem
almost without explanation.''

Taiwan flap's a tempest in a Chinese teapot
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; An AP News Analysis &QL; 
 &UR; By WALTER R. MEARS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Special Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ When the Republicans' Taiwan tempest is over,
nothing will have changed, a fitting outcome for an odd dispute in
which President Bill Clinton and his Senate critics said all they
wanted was the policy they already had.
	   Clinton said they had it, unaltered by his restatement of it in
Beijing and Shanghai. Republican critics said not _ one accusing
him of stabbing Taiwan in the back, another saying he had sent a
wrong and risky message.
	   So Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, produced a resolution
to reaffirm U.S. policy, calling it necessary to correct Clinton
and repair the damage of his words while saying the measure ``does
not break new ground.''
	   Lott then complained that Clinton was not ambiguous enough about
the U.S. position on the island, which Beijing has considered a
breakaway province since 1949.
	   Ambiguity has been a purposeful part of U.S. policy toward
Taiwan since the shift in relations from Taipei, the old
Nationalist stronghold, to the Communist-ruled mainland after
then-President Richard M. Nixon went to Beijing in 1972. Diplomatic
recognition was shifted to the mainland in 1979.
	   Ambiguity and diplomatic double talk. It isn't easy to explain a
policy that recognizes one China, Beijing's; disowns an independent
Taiwan; but also provides, by 1979 law, for the sale of defensive
weapons adequate to defend against a Chinese takeover attempt.
	   Clinton tried to outline the policy in Shanghai on June 30, in
discussing his summit with President Jiang Zemin:
	   ``I had a chance to reiterate our Taiwan policy, which is that
we don't support independence for Taiwan, or two Chinas, or one
Taiwan-one China. And we don't believe that Taiwan should be a
member in any organization for which statehood is a requirement. So
I think we have a consistent policy.
	   ``Our only policy has been that we think it has to be done
peacefully. That is what our law says and we have encouraged the
cross-strait dialogue. And I think eventually it will bear fruit if
everyone is patient and works hard.''
	   Six sentences that stirred the political rebuke in the
Republican Senate.
	   Clinton said he uttered them because he had been asked publicly
about Taiwan and wanted ``to simply clarify to both sides that
there had been no change in our policy.''
	   It could also have been an effort to revise and amend a
statement he made while answering student questions at Peking
University on June 29; he said then that nothing in U.S. policy
would be an obstacle to the peaceful reunification of China and
Taiwan. Reunification isn't part of the standard administration
wording on the issue.
	   Then again, he could have gone further and said that the United
States does not challenge the premise that Taiwan is a part of
China. That might really have stirred up his Republican critics,
unless they recognized the wording of the Shanghai communique Nixon
signed in 1972.
	   Lott's resolution reaffirms the U.S. commitment to Taiwan, to a
peaceful resolution of its future and to providing _ selling _ arms
for defense. The president said so, too. The resolution also urges
Clinton to seek a public renunciation of the use of force by the
mainland against Taiwan; he didn't say that in China, but he did
say that the future has to be settled peacefully.
	   When China staged military exercises and fired missiles near
Taiwan during presidential elections on the island in 1996, the
U.S. administration sent two aircraft carriers to the area, while
warning Beijing against force.
	   At the Beijing summit, Jiang said Taiwan remains ``the most
sensitive issue'' in U.S.-China relations.
	   Perhaps it is also the most difficult to resolve. Taiwan is
economically potent and increasingly democratic. The United States
sells more exports there than to the mainland. Taiwan fosters ties
with Congress; eight House members and 126 staffers reported
expense-paid trips there over little more than a year. The Taipei
government is among former Sen. Bob Dole's clients.
	   While Lott complained, the Senate Democratic leader said
Clinton's words had not altered policy at all. ``Obviously, we want
to protect the Taiwanese's rights and ensure that we recognize
their unique status in the world,'' Sen. Tom Daschle said. ``I
think that's been done.''

Official: Malaysian banks need to improve efficiency
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more comments &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia has to restructure its
financial sector to make banks more competitive and efficient but
won't open further to foreigners, a senior finance ministry
official said Thursday.
	   ``Without painful (financial sector) reforms, we will not be
able to overcome this current economic crisis,'' said Deputy
Finance Minister Affifuddin Omar.
	   Affifuddin's comments in a speech were a rare official
acknowledgement of the need to improve the domestic financial
industry.
	   While independent analysts have said the shaky financial sector
was responsible for the Malaysian currency's sharp decline,
government leaders have accused Western investors of orchestrating
speculative attacks on the ringgit for quick profit.
	   ``In the face of these challenges, both external as well as
internal, it is also important that domestic banks undergo various
forms of restructuring to enhance their efficiency and
competitiveness,'' Affifuddin said.
	   But he also said that there were no plans to open banking
further to overseas companies.
	   ``Under the World Trade Organization treaty, we are supposed to
allow it but the government has to slow down the process of
allowing (increased) foreign equity to come in,'' he said.
	   Malaysian banks needed more time to prepare for competition, he
said. ``We don't want foreigners to swarm in and flood our
financial markets. We will be colonized.''
	   Currently, foreigners are only allowed to own up to a 30 percent
stake in local banks. There are only a handful of foreign banks,
which are locally incorporated.
	   Many Malaysian banks, which once lent liberally to real estate
companies, are worried that many of these loans will never be
repaid and are refusing to extend new loans.
	   The Malaysian ringgit has lost nearly 40 percent of its value
against the dollar in one year. The economy shrank 1.8 percent in
the first quarter of 1998, compared to 6.9 percent growth in the
previous year.

Mexican government offers proposal to restart Chiapas peace talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo MO103 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The Mexican government has made a proposal
for the Zapatista rebels to return to negotiations, promising to
begin a series of actions to relax tensions in Chiapas state once
talks resume.
	   In a Wednesday night news conference, chief government
negotiator Emilio Rabasa Gamboa said Mexico intends to promote
development in the impoverished southern state and would release
imprisoned Zapatista rebels and their supporters who have not been
directly implicated in acts of violence.
	   In exchange, he said, the government asked the rebels to
cooperate in having its fighters and supporters voluntarily turn in
weapons that were not protected by a previous dialogue agreement.
	   Rabasa released a government proposal for a ``relaxation of
tension'' that calls on the leftist rebels to stop any actions
aimed at creating new ``autonomous municipalities'' _ a reference
to the symbolic, parallel town councils set up by Zapatista
supporters in Chiapas.
	   The proposal also notes that the military will not withdraw
troops from Chiapas _ a step many critics say is necessary to
foster peace _ because of the continuing need to protect national
sovereignty and territorial integrity.
	   In its proposal, the government called on the rebels to set a
time and place for negotiations to resume.
	   There was no immediate public reaction from the Zapatistas.
	   An opposition congressman, Pablo Gomez of the leftist Democratic
Revolution Party, said that aside from the promise to free
imprisoned Zapatista supporters, the proposal ``is absolutely good
for nothing.''
	   ``Outside of this, the document contains nothing but pure
reiterations of what has already been said,'' Gomez said in a radio
interview. ``It supports nothing new.''
	   The leftist Zapatista National Liberation Army took up arms in
January 1994 to demand greater democracy and rights for the state's
poor Indians. After a brief but bloody conflict, the rebels
declared a ceasefire and entered negotiations with the government.
Talks broke down, however, in 1996 with the rebels accusing the
government of displaying bad faith.
	   Meanwhile, dozens have been killed in clashes between
pro-government paramilitary groups and rebel supporters.

Indian woman jailed for murder writes wrenching story of her life
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo CPT105 &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Yvonne Johnson, the great-great-granddaughter of
a renowned Cree chief, was raped while still a toddler, abused
throughout her youth, convicted at 27 of a role in a killing and is
now the only Indian woman in Canada serving a life sentence for
murder.
	   She also is the co-author of ``Stolen Life: The Journey of a
Cree Woman,'' a wrenching book about herself that is winning
accolades across Canada.
	   The Canadian news weekly Macleans, in a full-page review this
week, called it ``a raw book, full of anguish.'' The Toronto-based
Globe and Mail, a nationally circulated daily, lauded it as ``an
engrossing tribute to the human spirit.''
	   Johnson, now 36, was born in Butte, Montana, the daughter of a
Cree woman and a former U.S. Marine of Norwegian descent.
	   As a child, she was sexually assaulted by her father, brother
and grandfather, among others, and suffered taunts because of a
cleft palate that was not corrected until she was 16. She attempted
suicide several times and became an alcoholic.
	   By September 1989, she was a mother of three living in Alberta.
That month, in her own house, she and her husband and two other
people joined in the sexual assault and murder of a man whom
Johnson believed was a child molester.
	   All four were convicted of roles in the attack, but only Johnson
was found guilty of first-degree murder. She received a life
sentence with no possibility of parole until 2014.
	   While in prison, Johnson read ``The Temptations of Big Bear,'' a
novel about her great-great-grandfather by award-winning Canadian
writer Rudy Wiebe. Johnson was impressed by the white writer's
insight into native spirituality and began a correspondence with
Wiebe that resulted in a decision to co-write a book about her,
based largely on the journals she had been writing in prison.
	   The project took five years, culminating in an unusual book
launch last month at Canada's most distinctive prison: the Okimaw
Ohci Healing Lodge in southwestern Saskatchewan.
	   Consisting of cottages scattered around a lodge with a
tepee-shaped roof, it is the only prison in Canada oriented
primarily toward Indian women and employing traditional Indian
teachings as part of its rehabilitation program.
	   Chiefs and elders from across the Canadian Prairies attended the
launch, which included Cree singing, drumming and dancing. Larry
Oakes, the chief who served as master of ceremonies, praised
Johnson's ``ability to survive'' but also asked the audience to
remember the man she was convicted of killing.
	   Wiebe believes Johnson, because of her troubled background and
the circumstances of the killing, did not deserve a life sentence.
	   ``The question is not whether she was involved,'' Wiebe said in
a CBC radio interview. ``The question is whether the Canadian legal
system treated her justly.''
	   But Johnson says she has no expectation that her book will fuel
a successful campaign to shorten her sentence.
	   Asked at the book launch about her role in the killing, she
replied: ``It will stay with me the rest of my life. The best I can
do is dance the Sun Dance and ask the Creator for pity.''
	   She says the act of writing was therapeutic, even more so when
she began to realize that her words would be read by strangers.
	   ``Writing this book will release long-hidden fears, dreams,
hurts, love, pain,'' she wrote before her trial. ``I'm doing this
also in hopes of dealing with things I never did before.''

March supporters repelled after probing police lines
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with police repelling probe of security lines at
church; Orange delegation meeting Blair around 0900 GMT
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Police who have blocked
Protestant marchers at a rural church fired plastic bullets
Thursday morning to repel protesters who briefly broke through a
security line. No injuries were reported.
	   The clash came hours before leaders of the Orange Order were to
meet British Prime Minister Tony Blair in London in hopes of
winning permission for a contentious march to go through a hostile
Catholic neighborhood.
	   Blair has said he will not reverse a decision by Northern
Ireland's Parades Commission barring the Orangemen from marching on
the Garvaghy Road in Portadown, where Catholic residents say the
Protestant marchers are not welcome. The Garvaghy Road march has
sparked violent clashes the past three summers.
	   Overnight, police and soldiers were the target of gunfire and
bombs at Newtownabbey, 5 miles (8 kms) north of Belfast, and in
Portadown, and stolen vehicles were set afire as Protestant
hard-liners mounted a fourth night of protest. Six men were
arrested.
	   But police said it was the quietest night since Sunday, when
they stopped the Orange march at the Anglican church at Drumcree,
outside Portadown.
	   With upwards of 8,000 Orangemen and supporters massed in fields
around the church, police said one group cut down a tree and used
it as a bridge across the first of three security lines. Protesters
retreated after police fired a dozen plastic bullets _ the first
such action near the church since the march was stopped.
	   Police said they seized gasoline bombs in Carrickfergus, 12
miles (20 kilometers) northeast of Belfast, and bottles of
concentrated nitric acid in Glarryford, 30 miles (50 kilometers)
northwest of Belfast. Police said they believed the acid was
intended to be used against them.
	   As of midday Wednesday, police reported a dozen shootings, two
dozen grenade blasts, 73 homes of Catholics or police officers
vandalized, 93 businesses and schools damaged by fire, 136 vehicles
stolen and burned and another 279 damaged, 44 officers and an
unknown number of rioters wounded.
	   ``I think we are moving into a very, very dangerous situation
whereby we could even come to the stage of a complete confrontation
between the Orange and the army and police,'' David Jones, a
spokesman for the Orange Order in Portadown, said Wednesday.
	   ``That is a situation no one wants to see but the closer we come
to the weekend and the 12th of July makes it a lot more difficult.
That's why Tony Blair needs to be aware the clock is ticking and it
is ticking fast and he doesn't have much time left.''
	   The 12th of July, the anniversary of the Protestant King
William's victory over the Catholic King James II at the Battle of
the Boyne in 1690, is one of the most volatile and contentious
dates in Northern Ireland. Across the province, members of the
Orange Order march with fife and drum _ marches which many
Catholics regard as swaggering demonstrations of Protestant
dominance.
	   Orange leaders say they have a right to follow the same route
they have used since 1807, and they have refused to meet with the
leader of the Garvaghy Road protesters, a former Irish Republican
Army prisoner.
	   ``A little bit of tolerance could have been shown here and that
parade could have gone down in 10 minutes and this would have all
been over by now,'' said Connie Tedford, whose husband is among the
marchers. She joined about a hundred women and children in a
demonstration in Portadown Wednesday, before walking to the church.
	   Catholics opposed to Protestant marches along south Belfast's
Ormeau Road took the Parades Commission to court Wednesday to
challenge its decision permitting a small Orange parade next
Monday.
	   Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party, met
Wednesday with British Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam, and
said he was assured that ``they will not force a march down
Garvaghy Road,'' as happened in 1996 after four nights of
Protestant mayhem.

Fishing boat collides with whale in Tokyo Bay
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A fishing boat collided Thursday with a whale in
Tokyo Bay, hurting one person seriously and causing minor head
injuries to six others, the coast guard said.
	   The 11-ton Hosei Maru, carrying 14 people, crashed into the
whale about five kilometers (3.1 miles) off the coast of Tomiura,
south of Tokyo, said Maritime Safety Agency spokesman Koji
Nagamori.
	   Fisherman Akio Yamada, 34, broke his jaw in the accident and was
taken to a hospital, Nagamori said.
	   The boat slammed into the whale as it blocked the vessel's path
apparently trying to join other whales in its pod.
	   The whale's type was not immediately known. It was also unclear
if the whale was injured, but it was able to swim away with other
members of its group, Nagamori said.
	   Whale sightings in Tokyo Bay are extremely rare, said Nagamori.

Two arrested for embezzling money from Japanese bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Police in Tokyo arrested a former bank employee and
an importer Thursday for allegedly obtaining 108 million yen (dlrs
776,000) through illegal use of an on-line system.
	   Arrested were Yuji Nishida, 43, a former deputy manger of Midori
Bank's Tokyo branch, and Saburo Uehara, 46, president of a clothing
import firm, a spokesman for the Tokyo Metropolitan Police said.
	   The spokesman, on condition of anonymity, said that Nishida
illegally manipulated Midori Bank's on-line computer system to
transfer money into an account held by Uehara's firm on four
occasions between July and September of last year.
	   The Kobe-based Midori Bank fired Nishida last month after bank
officials discovered the illegal transfers, Kyodo News service
reported.
	   Public broadcaster NHK television said the total amount the two
men allegedly obtained illegally through May of this year was
estimated at 730 million yen (dlrs 5.25 million).
	   Midori Bank was set up in 1995 after it took over defunct Hyogo
Bank, which went bankrupt under the weight of bad loans.
	   Midori Bank, which has remained essentially insolvent since
March 31, is to be absorbed by medium-sized Hanshin Bank, also
headquartered in Kobe, in April next year.

Russian border guards kill one, wound one on Tajikistan border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian troops guarding Tajikistan's border killed
one suspected drug smuggler and captured another as they tried to
bring heroin into the Central Asian nation, a news report said
Thursday.
	   The Russian guards fired on three men Wednesday evening as they
tried to cross the Pyandzh River, which serves as the border
between Tajikistan and Afghanistan, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   One man was killed, a second was wounded and captured and the
third escaped, the report said. The border guards confiscated seven
kilograms (15 pounds) of heroin, it added.
	   Russia has about 25,000 troops supporting the government in
Tajikistan, and the soldiers regularly clash with smugglers trying
to enter the country.

Two grenades thrown at Cambodian justice minister's house
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Two grenades were thrown at the home
of Cambodia's justice minister early Thursday, but did not explode,
police and witnesses said.
	   One Russian-made grenade was lobbed over the fence and landed in
Chem Snguon's courtyard at 8:20 a.m., according to a family member
who said that the minister was not at home at the time of the
incident.
	   The other explosive was discovered by police outside the
compound after they arrived at the house to investigate, according
to municipal police chief Khuon Sophan, who speculated that the
grenades were thrown from a distance.
	   ``I dare not guess who was behind this,'' he said. ``We are
still investigating.''
	   Family members were unwilling to speculate whether there was a
political motive behind the planned attack, noting that the justice
minister has many enemies.
	   ``Of course, he is the minister of justice,'' said Chem Snguon's
son-in-law. ``So for every 50 friends he has, he also has 50
enemies.''
	   Cambodia is awash with weapons, a legacy of more than two
decades of civil war. Laws controlling unauthorized possession of
guns and grenades are rarely enforced.
	   On Monday a grenade was thrown in a children's amusement park
killing one person and injuring at least six others.
	   Though the blast came during the tense run-up to parliamentary
elections July 26, police said they believe the attack was not
politically motivated.

Earthquake strikes Portugal's Azores Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ An earthquake jolted Portugal's Azores
Islands in the Atlantic Ocean on Thursday, causing some houses to
collapse and sending people fleeing into the streets, according to
news reports.
	   The quake was felt most strongly on the islands of Horta and
Faial, part of the nine-island group 1,300 kilometers (800 miles)
west of Portugal, Portuguese state radio RDP reported.
	   The National Seismological Institute had no immediate
information about the size of the quake nor its epicenter.
	   The tremor was also felt on Terceira island where the U.S. Air
Force has a base, RDP said.
	   No further information was immediately available.
	   The islands have a total population of about 250,000.

Israeli army imposes curfew on parts of Hebron
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli troops on Thursday imposed a
curfew on parts of downtown Hebron after shots were fired a car
driven by Jewish settlers.
	   No one was hurt in the Wednesday night shooting. The settlers
were en route to the Tomb of the Patriarchs, a shrine in downtown
Hebron sacred to Jews and Muslims, when their car came under fire.
	   Bullets struck the car, and Israeli soldiers found spent
cartridges in the area, the army said.
	   The Voice of Palestine Radio said three Palestinians were
detained for questioning.
	   In response to the shooting, the army imposed a curfew on the
Jaber neighborhood in the downtown area which it controls. About 80
percent of Hebron is run by the Palestinian Authority.
	   Some 450 Jewish settlers and 130,000 Palestinians live in
Hebron.
	   In the past week, there have been several clashes between
settlers and Palestinian residents. Last weekend, three Israelis on
horseback smashed the windshields of Arab-owned cars.

Nagano Olympics end up in the black, official says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Strong sales and a weaker yen helped the Nagano
Winter Olympics post a 4.5 billion yen (dlrs 32 million) surplus,
an organizing committee official said Thursday.
	   The surplus will be used to promote sports in Japan, with
one-tenth of the money going to the Japanese Olympic Committee and
the rest to an Olympic memorial fund, said Nagano Olympic Committee
spokesman Sadao Shibamoto.
	   Higher-than-expected ticket and Olympic merchandise sales along
with the weak yen were the main factors in generating the surplus,
Shibamoto said.
	   Japan's weak currency boosted earnings from sales of overseas
television rights and foreign sponsorship deals, which were paid
for in dollars, Shibamoto said.
	   The total operating costs for the Games amounted to 113.9
billion yen (dlrs 814 million), he said.

Russia's reserves fall to dlrs 15.1 billion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Central Bank's reserves fell almost dlrs 1
billion in the past two weeks to dlrs 15.1 billion amid ongoing
market turmoil in Russia, the bank said Thursday.
	   The bank did not say why its reserves slumped, but it has been
spending U.S. dollars to support the Russian ruble and prevent a
possible devaluation.
	   The Central Bank reserves previously reported reserves of dlrs
16 billion on June 26.
	   With the Central's banks help, the ruble has remained relatively
stable and is trading at about 6.20 rubles to the dollar. The
government fears that a devaluation will result in price increases
and inflict additional economic pain on the country's hard-pressed
citizens.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Strong sales and a weaker yen helped the Nagano
Winter Olympics post a 4.5 billion yen (dlrs 32 million) surplus,
an organizing committee official said Thursday.
	   The surplus will be used to promote sports in Japan, with
one-tenth of the money going to the Japanese Olympic Committee and
the rest to an Olympic memorial fund, said Nagano Olympic Committee
spokesman Sadao Shibamoto.
	   Higher-than-expected ticket and Olympic merchandise sales along
with the weak yen were the main factors in generating the surplus,
Shibamoto said.
	   Japan's weak currency boosted earnings from sales of overseas
television rights and foreign sponsorship deals, which were paid
for in dollars, Shibamoto said.
	   The total operating costs for the games amounted to 113.9
billion yen (dlrs 814 million), he said.

Fire damages Russian news agency building
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A fire broke out in the building housing a Russian
news agency and a television station, but was extinguished quickly
and no one was one, news reports said on Thursday.
	   The blaze in the downtown headquarters of the RIA-Novosti news
agency flared shortly before the midnight Wednesday, filling the
building with thick smoke and disrupting the broadcast of the
nationwide Kultura TV channel which has studios in the same
building.
	   The fire is believed to have been sparked by a short-circuit in
a computer, the Interfax news agency said. There was no immediate
assessment of the damage.

Asian Development Bank grants dlrs 300 million loan to Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Asian Development Bank said
Thursday it has granted a dlrs 300 million package of loans for
poverty-alleviation projects in Indonesia.
	   ``The current economic crisis in Indonesia is expected to force
hundreds of thousands of poor children to drop out of school,
thousands of pregnant women to be unable to receive adequate
prenatal care and thousands of infants to receive poor nutrition,''
the Manila-based bank said.
	   The bank said the loans will ``help mitigate the impact of the
crisis on the poor.''
	   The loans will be administered by the Social Protection Sector
Development Program, which was formed by the Indonesian government
and the ADB. The program aims to protect essential social services
in areas such as education, health, nutrition and family planning.
	   The ADB noted that Indonesia's poverty rate declined between
1973 and 1996 from 40 percent to 11 percent of the population.
	   ``However, the current crisis threatens these achievements,'' it
said in a statement.
	   The depreciation of the rupiah, high inflation, soaring
unemployment and a recession have driven large numbers of people
below the poverty line this year.
	   The ADB said the Indonesian government's budget is severely
constrained, while prices of essential supplies, such as medicine,
are rising. As a result, it said, the quality of basic social
services will be threatened.
	   Last month, the ADB approved a loan of dlrs 1.5 billion to help
strengthen Indonesia's financial sector.
	   The SPSD package consists of a program loan of dlrs 100 million
and a dlrs 200 million project loan.
	   The repayment periods are 15 years for the program loan,
including a grace period of three years, and 22 years for the
project loan, which has a two-year grace period.
	   In addition to the dlrs 300 million, the ADB also provided a
dlrs 3 million technical assistance grant from the Japan Special
Fund to help pay for a study of the impact of the SPSD loans.

All Blacks vulnerable says coach Hart
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ All Blacks rugby coach John Hart
admits his unsettled team is vulnerable to defeat in Saturday's
opening tri-series test against Australia.
	   The Wallabies have not beaten the All Blacks since 1994 but a
strong start to the season, coupled by significant changes in New
Zealand ranks, has the hosts confident of ending the poor run.
	   Hart has plenty to gain from talking up Australia's chances and
he's doing plenty of talking.
	   But Hart says he genuinely believes Australia poses the greatest
threat to the team since he took over in 1995.
	   ``A feeling that we are more vulnerable today than we were in
1997 or 1996 is absolutely correct,'' Hart said Thursday. ``Without
tongue in cheek I would say Australia is better prepared than us.
Melbourne will be a very huge test. Every win you have brings a
loss closer and we haven't lost for a while.''
	   New Zealand is missing retired veterans Sean Fitzpatrick, Frank
Bunce and Zinzan Brooke from last season while winger Jonah Lomu
has been dropped because of poor form.
	   The All Blacks have lost just one of their 25 tests since France
beat them 22-15 in Toulouse in November 1995. South Africa scored
the lone win, a 32-22 victory in the last of 11 Tests in 1996. New
Zealand has won a remarkable 82 of 95 matches since its World Cup
title in 1987.
	   ``Any team that loses the experience factor of Fitzpatrick,
Brooke and Bunce is going to be damaged and then we've got injuries
on top of it,'' Hart said. ``We are probably seven or eight players
down on where we might have been but that's part of our challenge,
to have a seamless transition, but that's not going to be easy.
	   ``It's a mini-rebuild and something we haven't had for a while
but we were always going to have it. It was never as though it
wasn't going to occur.''
	   Hart said he was impressed by the Australians, who have acquired
some stability in selection under new coach Rod Macqueen.
	   For the first time in Australian rugby history an unchanged
lineup has been named for a fourth consecutive test. The Wallabies
started the year with a 76-0 thrashing of England and two good wins
over Scotland.
	   ``Their demolition of England and a lot of the games against
Scotland they've shown exactly what I though they would,'' Hart
said. ``They are a far better organized side and already you are
seeing (coach) Rod Macqueen's influence coming though in terms or
organization, selection and management style.''
	   New Zealand flanker Josh Kronfeld backs his coach's belief that
they are facing a tougher Australian team this week.
	   ``I really feel there's an energy in the Australian team, an
attitude that says `we will knock over these guys in black,'''
Kronfeld said. ``For the first time for a couple of years there's
real determination there.''

Briton jumps to death at Thai seaside resort
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A British man, apparently depressed
over breaking up with his girlfriend, jumped to his death at a
hotel in the resort town of Pattaya, police said Thursday.
	   Barry Philip Edwards, 44, jumped early Wednesday from the eighth
floor of the Cherry Hotel in the seaside town, 110 kilometers (68
miles) southeast of Bangkok.
	   Police said that based on the testimony of hotel employees, they
believed Edwards committed suicide because he was depressed that
his Thai girlfriend had left him.
	   They said the hotel's receptionist told them Edwards, who had
been sharing a room with the woman since May, had appeared quiet
and withdrawn since the woman left three weeks ago.
	   Hotel employees also reported that two or three times a day, for
several hours at a time, he could be seen simply waiting in front
of the hotel.
	   There was no reason to suspect foul play, police said.

Earthquake strikes Portugal' Azores Islands
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details, reports of deaths &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ An earthquake jolted Portugal's Azores
Islands just before dawn Thursday, killing at least three people
and causing houses to collapse and people to flee onto the streets,
news reports said.
	   The quake was provisionally estimated to have a magnitude of 5.5
and the epicenter was in the Atlantic Ocean, 20 kilometers (12
miles) off the island of Horta, one of the group's nine volcanic
islands, the Lisbon-Based National Seismological Institute said.
	   Citing local rescue workers, Portuguese state radio RDP said at
least three people had died on Faial island. Authorities feared
there could be more victims.
	   ``The information we have received makes us suspect strongly
that there are some injuries and some people buried in their
(collapsed) houses,'' Faial Fire Service Commander Carlos Jaime
told RDP.
	   The jolt was felt at 5.22 a.m (0522 GMT) on four of the islands
which lie 1,287 kilometers (800 miles) west of Portugal, the radio
reported.
	   The islands of Faial and Horta were reportedly the hardest-hit.
	   Civil Protection Services were alerted on the four islands, .
	   The tremor was also felt on Terceira island where the U.S. Air
Force has a base, RDP said.
	   The weather was said to be fine.
	   No further information was immediately available.
	   The islands have a total population of about 250,000, most of
them living from agriculture.

Defense makes final arguments in extradition hearing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANNA HARMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An American teen-ager wanted for murder in
Maryland was brought to court handcuffed and shackled Thursday for
a final hearing in his fight against extradition to the United
States.
	   Samuel Sheinbein, 17, did not look at his parents as he shuffled
into Jerusalem District Court. His father, Sol, walked up to
Sheinbein, ruffled his hair and kissed him on the head.
	   The younger Sheinbein, clean-shaven and wearing a white shirt
and black pants, did not speak as he took his seat next to his
lawyers.
	   In Thursday's closed-door hearing, defense lawyer David Libai
was to deliver final arguments on why his client should not be sent
to Maryland to stand trial in the September dismemberment killing
of a 19-year-old acquaintance, Alfred Tello Jr.
	   The judge was not expected to rule Thursday.
	   Sheinbein fled to Israel after the killing and is claiming
Israeli citizenship in an attempt to prevent his extradition.
Israeli law bars citizens from being sent abroad to stand trial.
	   Israeli prosecutor Irit Kaan has said that allowing Sheinbein to
take refuge in Israel would be a ``cynical exploitation'' of
Israel's citizenship laws.
	   Sheinbein's lawyers argue that his father, Sol, is an Israeli
citizen, and that the status was automatically passed on to him.
	   But Israel says that Sheinbein's father lost his citizenship
because he moved his family to the United States in 1950, before
the country's citizenship law went into effect.
	   Sheinbein never lived in Israel and never held an Israeli
passport.
	   Another teen-ager charged in the murder, 18-year-old Aaron
Needle, hanged himself in his Maryland cell in April.

Agreement finalized on eight-nation tournament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Soccer officials have reached agreement
for Vietnam to stage the eight-nation Tiger Cup starting Aug. 26,
the Vietnam Football Federation said Thursday.
	   The competition originally was to have been held in Indonesia,
but the country's economic and political turmoil led the Asian
Football Federation to seek a new site.
	   The competition then was offered to Malaysia, which said it
would be too busy with the Commonwealth Games. With government
backing, Vietnam then got the nod and will stage the tournament in
Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.
	   The eight-team competition, which finishes Sept. 5, features
national squads from eight regional countries: Thailand, Malaysia,
Myanmar, Indonesia, Singapore, Laos, Vietnam and the Philippines.
	   Although Vietnam never has advanced to the World Cup finals,
soccer is by far the top sport in the country. The populace has
been mesmerized by the tournament in France, even though some
matches are shown live at 2 a.m.

EU commissioner urges great role for women in European work place
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   INNSBRUCK, Austria (AP) _ The European Union must campaign for a
greater role for women in the work place over the next five years,
the EU social commissioner said.
	   ``Greater participation by women is not only politically correct
but is also a necessity due to demographics,'' Padraig Flynn of
Ireland told an EU seminar Wednesday.
	   Flynn said the presence of women in the work place means more
tax money available to governments and also reduces the number of
people requiring economic assistance.
	   In order to take advantage of the potential of women, Flynn said
EU governments should improve access to education and training for
all groups in society.
	   He urged governments to study ways to reach that goal.
	   Flynn also said the EU must increase efforts to reduce the
``unacceptable'' rate of Europe-wide unemployment from 10.3 percent
to six to seven percent.

Australia urges Indonesian troops to show restraint against
</HEADLINE>
protesters &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Australia's visiting foreign minister
urged Indonesia's military Thursday to show restraint in the face
of rising protests across the country as well as separatist
tensions in East Timor and Irian Jaya.
	   Several pro-independence protesters were killed or wounded when
the military put down demonstrations in the two territories in
recent days.
	   At least one man was killed and 24 others were wounded Monday
when police opened fire to break up a crowd that had raised a rebel
flag in Irian Jaya, the Indonesian-controlled western half of New
Guinea.
	   The military described the flag-raising ceremony as
``treasonous.''
	   Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said he had raised concerns
about the shootings in a 70-minute meeting with Indonesian
President B.J. Habibie on Thursday.
	   ``I made it clear that the Australian government thinks it is
very important that the Indonesian military exercise maximum
restraint,'' Downer said at a news conference.
	   Indonesia was rocked by protests and riots in May, which helped
force President Suharto to quit, ending 32 years of autocratic
rule. About 1,200 people died in the violence.
	   Since then, protests have become an almost daily occurrence
under new President Habibie, who has promised democratic reform.
	   Many fear widespread civil unrest might flare again across
Indonesia as inflation and unemployment soar and poverty and food
shortages spread.
	   Downer said that apart from the killings of four student
protesters, Indonesian troops had mostly displayed restraint
through most of May's political turmoil. He said it was ``very
important'' that they continue to do this.
	   Indonesia took control of Irian Jaya from Dutch colonial rule in
1963 and invaded East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, in 1975.
	   Wanting to end a long-running guerrilla war in East Timor,
Habibie recently offered to grant special status to the disputed
territory and to release an imprisoned rebel leader in exchange for
international recognition of Indonesian sovereignty there.
	   However, Habibie has rejected separatist demands that a
referendum be held on the question of outright independence.
	   Downer said no instant solution could be expected for East
Timor, which remained ``a very divided place.''
	   Nevertheless, he said he was encouraged by developments in
negotiations and that that both sides needed ``time and space'' to
maintain talks.
	   Despite growing tensions in several areas, Downer rejected
predictions that Indonesia, an ethnically diverse nation of about
17,000 islands with 202 million people, could break up.

Earthquake strikes Portugal' Azores Islands

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ An earthquake jolted Portugal's Azores
Islands just before dawn Thursday, killing at least three people
and causing houses to collapse and people to flee onto the streets,
news reports said.
	   The quake was provisionally estimated to have a magnitude of 5.5
and had its epicenter in the Atlantic Ocean, 20 kilometers (12
miles) off the island of Faial, one of the group's nine volcanic
islands, the Lisbon-Based National Seismological Institute said.
	   Citing local rescue workers, Portuguese state radio RDP said at
least three people were killed and 30 others injured on Faial
island. Authorities feared there could be more victims.
	   ``The information we have received makes us suspect strongly
that there are some injuries and some people buried in their
(collapsed) houses,'' Faial Fire Service Commander Carlos Jaime
told RDP.
	   The jolt was felt at 5.22 a.m (0522 GMT) on four of the islands
which lie 1,300287 kilometers (800 miles) west of Portugal, the
radio reported.
	   The island of Faial was reportedly the hardest-hit.
	   Civil Protection Services were also alerted on the islands of
Pico, Sao Jorge and Terceira, where the U.S. Air Force has a base,
RDP said.
	   In the immediate aftermath of the quake, the weather was said to
be fine in the area.
	   The islands have a total population of about 250,000, most of
them living from agriculture. The islands have been hit by
earthquakes in the past, the worst being in 1980.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will visit China
next week for talks focusing on the stalled Middle East peace
process, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced Thursday.
	   Arafat was invited by President Jiang Zemin. During his visit
starting Monday, the two leaders will discuss bilateral relations,
regional affairs and other issues, but ``the peace process in the
Middle East will be the main topic in their conversation,'' said

Israeli army imposes curfew on parts of Hebron

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli troops on Thursday imposed a
curfew on parts of downtown Hebron after shots were fired at a car
driven by Jewish settlers.
	   No one was hurt in the Wednesday night shooting. The settlers
were en route to the Tomb of the Patriarchs, a shrine in downtown
Hebron sacred to Jews and Muslims, when their car came under fire.
	   Bullets struck the car, and Israeli soldiers found spent
cartridges in the area, the army said.
	   The Voice of Palestine Radio said three Palestinians were
detained by Israeli soldiers for questioning.
	   In response to the shooting, the army imposed a curfew
restricting Palestinians to their homes in the downtown Jaber
neighborhood which remains under Israeli control. About 80 percent
of the West Bank city is run by the Palestinian Authority.
	   Some 450 Jewish settlers and 130,000 Palestinians live in
Hebron.
	   In the past week, there have been several clashes between
settlers and Palestinian residents. Last weekend, three Israelis on
horseback smashed the windshields of Arab-owned cars.

Cargo company chief: cargo services worse at new airport
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PRISCILLA CHEUNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A top official of Hong Kong's major cargo
company told an urgent legislative briefing Thursday that for the
foreseeable future, cargo services at the territory's troubled new
airport would not match those of the old airport.
	   Passenger services have been improving steadily after a rocky
start. Officials say they still are not satisfied, but that
baggage-handling, flight display and departure delays are on their
way to being solved.
	   Focus now has shifted to Hong Kong's role as a center for the
highly lucrative air cargo trade.
	   The comments by Anthony Charter, head of Hong Kong Air Cargo
Terminals, raised fears that the import-export trade would be hurt
just as the economy, contracting for the first time in 14 years,
needs a major boost.
	   ``I'm afraid it's simply no way that the standard of service
that we've all grown accustomed to at Kai Tak can be maintained for
the foreseeable future,'' Charter told legislators. He said import
freight handling may take 24 hours longer than it used to at the
old Kai Tak airport until the problem is solved.
	   Government officials refused to say whether anyone should be
disciplined for the nagging problems that have plagued the opening
days of the dlrs 20 billion Chek Lap Kok airport. Legislators
demanded an independent investigation.
	   After a complete systems breakdown, the cargo company, which
held Hong Kong's monopoly in freight handling at old Kai Tak, moved
import and export clearance operations back to its facilities at
the old airport. It imposed a three-day embargo on cargo carried by
passenger planes until Friday midnight.
	   The ban would cost about 3 billion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 388
million), based on industry estimates, the South China Morning Post
reported.
	   On Saturday, cargo exports will move back to Chek Lap Kok, while
imports will be handled at Kai Tak, Charter said. He said the
arrangement may last for several weeks until ``we can fully analyze
the problems that we've got.''
	   Hui Cheung-ching, who represents importers and exporters and
belongs to the pro-Beijing Hong Kong Progressive Alliance, said the
private sector faces losses as foreign importers cancel contracts.
	   ``Hong Kong relies on cargo transport. This is vital to our
economic development, especially at an economic downturn,'' said
Emily Lau, of the populist Frontier movement.
	   Officials said another small freight company, AAT, has been
working smoothly since Monday.
	   Charter acknowledged publicly for the first time that the
company wasn't ready to open on July 6, raising speculation that
the government had rushed the airport opening.
	   The contract stated that the freight company's facility must be
operational by Aug. 18, although the company has the responsibility
to try its best to match the opening date, according to Airport
Authority officials.
	   ``We had no bones about the difficulties we had with the
construction of the facility. We knew we were running behind
schedule for that, we knew we need four months to commission
systems, and we have just not been about to get the time to
complete those tests,'' Charter said.
	   Martin Lee, leader of Hong Kong's de facto opposition, blamed
the government for rushing to open the airport. ``We haven't given
ourselves sufficient time to conduct sufficient tests,'' he said.

Chinese dissident detained for trying to join opposition party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police took a Chinese dissident from his home
Thursday, apparently for trying to join an illegal opposition
party, a Hong Kong-based rights group reported.
	   Yu Tielong telephoned fellow democracy campaigner Wang Youcai
Wednesday night to say he was interested in joining Wang's China
Democracy Party, the Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement reported.
	   Three police officers showed up at Yu's home in eastern Hangzhou
city at 10 a.m. Thursday and forcibly took him away, the group
said.
	   On the eve of U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to China last
month, Wang and several colleagues announced they were forming the
China Democracy Party.
	   Despite several requests by Wang, authorities have refused to
register the group as required by law, and Yu Tielong is at least
the third person connected with the party to have been detained.
	   Chinese police have refused to issue a passport for another
dissident, Yao Zhenxian, so that he can receive medical treatment
in the United States, the Information Center said.
	   Yao was reportedly beaten by police when first detained in April
1996. His health worsened during two years of imprisonment at a
labor camp, and upon his release in April he checked into a
hospital.
	   Police turned down his application for a passport, saying he
represented a potential ``threat to national security,'' the
Information Center said.

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ An earthquake jolted Portugal's Azores

Japan turns to solar, wind power to prepare for the Big One
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Japanese government is preparing solar- and
wind-powered generators to prevent power outages caused by major
earthquakes like the one that devastated the city of Kobe in 1995.
	   Japan is spending 4 billion yen (dlrs 30 million) this year to
build the generators at public parks and schools, Hajime Wakuta,
who heads the project for the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry, said Thursday.
	   The first generators were set up following the 1995 quake in the
western port city of Kobe, which killed 6,300 people and left
hundreds of thousands of residents without electricity for days and
even weeks.
	   The generators would be used to power radios, air conditioners
and even medical equipment in case the main power grid fails,
Wakuta said.
	   Wakuta said the generators were durable and easy to use.
	   He said Japan has been installing them at a rate of several
dozen per year since the Kobe quake. More than 100 are already in
place in the entire country.

Former Khmer Rouge guerrillas prepare to vote in Cambodian polls
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PAILIN, Cambodia (AP) _ Better known as vicious killers who
followed a backward ultra-Communist ideology, the Khmer Rouge will
soon be trying their hand at democracy.
	   Nationwide elections later this month are not only the former
guerrillas' first-ever formal vote, but also their best hope to
bring peace and development to an area of Cambodia where war and
brutality have long been the norm.
	   ``I can't wait for election day,'' said Say Nuon, who has spent
a quarter of his life in the jungle laying land mines and fleeing
bullets.
	   The ballot, says the 70-year-old, will help bring legitimacy to
lifelong outlaws who two decades ago turned the country into a vast
killing field on which as many as 2 million Cambodians died through
starvation, disease and systematic execution.
	   Ousted from power by Vietnamese-backed troops in 1979, the Khmer
Rouge continued to wage war against successive governments. They
boycotted the 1993 U.N.-brokered elections and today are on the
verge of extinction.
	   For the parties that have plastered this town with campaign
posters, Pailin has political and military value as well a trove of
natural resources, gems and timber among them.
	   Pailin, which borders Thailand, was one of the first rebel
strongholds to defect to the government in 1996, when some 10,000
guerrillas under Ieng Sary, deputy premier during the Khmer Rouge
reign of terror, gave up a futile civil war. He received a royal
pardon in exchange.
	   Earlier this year, the last guerrilla stronghold of Anlong Veng
also came under government control, bringing the number of
guerrillas soldiers and civilians who would be voting on election
day to around 20,000.
	   Of Pailin's roughly 25,000 people, former fighters and their
families make up at least half. Some of the one-time rebels have
become government soldiers, others work clearing mines, while still
others hold civilian jobs at city hall or are running businesses.
	   In practical terms, their lives will probably change little
after the July 26 election. But they, like the rest of the town's
residents, hope the vote will bring more government support for
Pailin _ new supplies for its hospitals and schools, better roads,
and more reliable salaries for government workers.
	   The country's ruling Cambodian People's Party and its main
challengers, FUNCINPEC and the Sam Rainsy Party, have draped
political banners in restaurants and on trees in Pailin and other
former jungle bases. They hit hard on the themes of development,
peace and an end to corruption.
	   Although officially it has been run by the government for over
two years, Pailin has operated more like an independent fiefdom. To
finance their guerrilla war, Ieng Sary and his underlings sold
gem-mining concessions to Thai mining companies, turning Pailin
into a diamond boom town.
	   Some of that money has gone into development, but not all the
modernization in Pailin has been welcome. Efforts by the former
guerrillas to forestall social ills that plague much of the rest of
Cambodia _ including prostitution and gambling _ have so far
failed.
	   Ieng Sary's son, Ieng Vuth, warned that authorities must act
fast and use education to curb, if not stop, the spread of evils
like AIDS.
	   Despite the Khmer Rouge's unsavory past, candidates are courting
the former fighters. They represent a significant swath of the
countryside, and, because of the importance of military strength in
Cambodia, even if a minority party wins the Khmer Rouge vote, it
would have added clout.
	   Although Cambodian leaders have said the reintegration of the
former fighters was critical, critics claim the rebel group was
buying time to plot a return to power in a new, more palatable
form.
	   If such plots exist among the Khmer Rouge leadership, former
fighters and their families in Pailin seem unaware.
	   Toch Touch, a 43-year-old former rebel now working at the Pailin
City Hall, said that while it remains unclear which political party
the people of Pailin will pick, most just want someone who will end
the killing and violence and give the one-time rebels a new sense
of belonging.
	   ``With an election, Pailin will be fully linked with the
government,'' Toch Touch said. ``Without it, we may continue to
wonder where we fit in.''

Tokyo stocks decline, dollar rises
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Wraps up with late dollar, closing bond, other details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stock prices declined Thursday in light
trading amid disappointment over a lack of specifics in the prime
minister's promise to cut taxes. The U.S. dollar rose against the
yen.
	   The 225-issue benchmark Nikkei Stock Average lost 84.02 points,
or 0.51 percent, closing at 16,446.95. On Wednesday, the Nikkei had
climbed 114.69 points, or 0.70 percent.
	   Traders said stocks fell on profit-taking following recent gains
in the market. The yen's renewed weakness against the dollar also
discouraged investors.
	   After the market closed Wednesday, Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto promised to implement permanent tax cuts next year, but
did not specify the amount of the tax relief or how the government
would offset the lower revenue.
	   ``Implementing a permanent tax cut next year was already a
foregone conclusion. But Hashimoto didn't even hint at the size of
the tax cuts,'' said Kazuhito Furukawa, a trader at Nippon Credit
Bank.
	   Japan's major trading partners, including the United States,
have urged Japan to make permanent tax cuts to help stimulate the
nation's sagging economy so Japanese can buy more, especially from
other ailing Asian economies.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section fell 6.12 points, or 0.48 percent, to 1,262.28. It
had gained 3.59 points, or 0.28 percent, the previous day.
	   An estimated 397 million shares changed hands on the first

French media swoons after World Cup victory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ No adjective was too strong Thursday as French
media swaddled the home team with rapturous elogies after France
defeated Croatia to win a berth in the World Cup final.
	   No matter what the result of Sunday's game with Brazil, the
conservative daily Le Figaro predicted a ``sumptuous final'' for a
team the newspaper said already has become a ``legend.''
	   The leftist daily Liberation, which devoted no less than eight
pages to covering the semifinal match, said Sunday's game
represented the ``dream final.''
	   Even French intellectuals chimed in, reflecting the World Cup
mania that is sweeping the country and unifying the nation.
	   ``A magnificent match,'' Erik Orsenna, a member of the Academie
Francaise, told RTL radio Thursday morning.
	   Aime Jacquet, the dour French coach who is often criticized for
having sacrificed style in favor of a steady, sure defense, won
praise for leading France to a World Cup final for the first time.
	   ``Bravo!'' crowed the national sports daily, L'Equipe in paying
tribute to the French team, fullback Lilian Thurman, whose two
goals put France in the final as well as Jacquet.
	   ``Historic'' said L'Est Republicain newspaper. In its editorial,
the regional daily lauded Jacquet. ``We have discovered a man who
is firm, ardent, with clear ideas.
	   Michel Hidalgo, a former coach of the French national team, said
Jacquet had achieved ``something exceptional.''
	   ``Not only does he have good players, not only the best players,
but he has done something more difficult, he has put together what
seems to be the best team,'' Hidalgo told Radio Monte Carlo.

Rivalry between coastal and Andean candidates splits Ecuador in

	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ Ecuador chooses a new president on Sunday,
and the vote, like the small South American nation, will be split
in two by the towering Andean mountains.
	   The vote pits front-runner Jamil Mahuad, the Harvard-educated
mayor of the high-altitude inland capital of Quito against banana
tycoon Alvaro Noboa, a populist from Guayaquil on Ecuador's
tropical Pacific coast.
	   Antagonism between the coast and mountainous interior dates to
Ecuador's colonization by Spain, when Quito became the center of
political power and Guayaquil its main port and economic
powerhouse. People on the coast have long resented Quito's
political domination.
	   Despite denials by both candidates that they are playing on the
rivalry, the centuries-old clash between the regions underlies the
election.
	   Polls show Mahuad, a centrist with the reputation as a good
administrator, easily leading Noboa, the scion of Ecuador's richest
family who has promised to create jobs for the poor and give ``the
beating of the century'' to the Quito-based political elite.
	   The winner will inherit a country of 12 million people plagued
by petty politics, including a president known for his eccentric
behavior who was ousted by Congress in 1997 for ``mental
incapacity,'' as well as an economic recession caused by El Nino's
destruction and falling oil prices.
	   Mahuad and Noboa were the top vote-getters in the May 31 first
round of voting. Since neither won an outright majority, a runoff
was called.
	   ``Noboa is using regionalism in his campaign, asking people from
the coast to vote for him and attacking Quito,'' Mahuad said, who
has accused him of dividing the country.
	   Analysts say Noboa's best hope to catch Mahuad is to appeal to
coastal resentment of Quito and, as a relative political newcomer,
play on popular disgust with the corrupt political elite.
	   ``Mahuad is more of the same,'' Noboa says during campaign
rallies.
	   Noboa, in turn, accuses Mahuad of scorning people from the
banana-growing coast, who are derisively referred to as ``monos''
or ``monkeys'' by highlanders.
	   ``Mahuad incarnates the aspirations of the mountain region,
while Noboa's candidacy represents an increased participation in
Ecuadorean politics by the coast,'' said Joffre Torbay, one of
Noboa's principal advisers.
	   Little love is lost between the highlanders and their coastal
neighbors.
	   On the coast, people primarily eat rice, fish and bananas. In
the mountains, the diet is mostly based around potatoes. On the
coast, people dance to hot salsa music. In the mountains, the
choice is melanchoic Andean folk music.
	   People from Quito are considered impassive, an inheritance from
the Quechua-speaking Indian communities in the highlands. Along the
coast, people are mostly seen as extroverted, with clothing peeled
off and life taking on a tropical beat.
	   Quito's power has long rested on an alliance of the armed
forces, large landholders and the Roman Catholic Church. At the
start of the century, Guayaquil's growing merchant class began
challenging that power.
	   To this day, 90 percent of the armed forces' officer corps comes
from the highlands.
	   Ecuador's population is divided equally between the coast and
the mountains, and in recent years the political pendulum has swung
back and forth between the regions.
	   Ecuador's last elected president, Abdala Bucaram, was from
Guayaquil.
	   Bucaram angered Quito residents by seldom visiting the capital
during his six-month government and refusing to live in the
presidential palace.
	   Known as ``El Loco'' or ``The Crazy One'' for his erratic
behavior, he was removed from power by Congress in February 1997
amid massive street protests.
	   Congress named Quito-native Fabian Alarcon as his interim
replacement, accentuating coastal resentment.
	   From exile in Panama where he fled after his ouster, Bucaram has
loudly supported the candidacy of his fellow Guayaquil-native
Noboa.
	   Noboa ran the Central Bank during Bucaram's government and many
fear that if he is elected he will bring back the disgraced former
president and his allies.
	   Bucaram's Roldosista party in late June pulled its support for
Noboa after the two quarreled, but the popular image that he is
Bucaram's puppet remains.
	   Mahuad, in contrast, presents himself as a much-needed dose of
stability after years of chaos. The final days of Bucaram's
government were plagued by national strikes, protests and charges
of corruption.

Indian businesses welcome U.S. Senate review of sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KRISHNAN GURUSWAMY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Indian business leaders on Thursday
welcomed a proposal by U.S. senators to exempt American farm
exports from the sanctions imposed after India and Pakistan
conducted nuclear tests.
	   In Washington, a special Senate panel reviewing the U.S.
economic sanctions against India and Pakistan pressed Wednesday to
lift trade restrictions on farm products.
	   Senators Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, and Joe Biden,
a Delaware Democrat, said they would introduce legislation to allow
President Bill Clinton to waive some of the sanctions imposed
against India and Pakistan after they tested nuclear devices two
months ago. The amendments would exempt financing of agricultural
exports from the ban on loans and aid to the two countries.
	   The sanctions Clinton imposed were virtually automatic under a
1994 law and can only be lifted or amended by Congress.
	   ``We welcome anything that promotes business between the two
countries,'' said Dilip Chenoy, director of the Confederation of
Indian Industries, a powerful trade body.
	   Chenoy said the proposed legislation was partly prompted by the
eagerness of American farmers to outbid Australians in selling
wheat to India.
	   ``Currently, the sanctions prevent American farmers from selling
wheat to India. This is a major opportunity for them,'' Chenoy
said.
	   India imported dlrs 154.3 million worth of farm produce from the
United States in 1997, about dlrs 42 million more than the previous
year, according to U.S. government figures.
	   American businesses say the sanctions hurt U.S. interests and
end up helping competitors in other countries.
	   Last month, Senators Sam Brownback, a Kentucky Republican, and
Charles S. Robb, a Virginia Democrat, flew to New Delhi and
Islamabad to discuss the sanctions with Indian politicians.
	   ``On the issue of sanctions, I want to be clear: I reject the
use of food as a weapon in foreign policy,'' Brownback said then.
	   The U.S. joined other nations such as Japan, Britain and Germany
in condemning the nuclear tests and imposing sanctions.
	   In New Delhi, Foreign Ministry spokesman K.C. Singh refused to
comment on the proposed change, saying the situation was still
evolving.
	   India said it tested nuclear weapons because it needed a
deterrent to the security threats it saw coming from Pakistan and
China. Pakistan responded with its own tests, stepping up the
region's nuclear arms race.
	   U.S. envoy Strobe Talbott and his Indian counterpart, Jaswant
Singh, were to meet Thursday in Frankfurt, Germany, for the second
round of talks on the nuclear issue.

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ An earthquake jolted Portugal's Azores
Islands in the Atlantic Ocean just before dawn Thursday, causing
houses to collapse and people to flee into the streets. At least
three people were killed and 30 injured, news reports said.
	   The quake had a magnitude of 5.8 and its epicenter was in the
Atlantic Ocean, 15 kilometers (10 miles) northeast of the island of
Faial, one of the group's nine volcanic islands, a spokesman for
Portugal's National Seismological Institute on the archipelago told
The Associated Press.
	   Initial institute estimates had put the magnitude at 5.5.
	   The island of Faial was reportedly the hardest hit by the quake.
	   Citing local rescue workers, Portuguese state radio RDP said at
least three people were killed and 30 others injured on Faial.
Authorities feared there could be more victims.
	   ``The information we have received makes us suspect strongly
that there are some injuries and some people buried in their
(collapsed) houses,'' Faial Fire Service Commander Carlos Jaime
told RDP.
	   The quake was felt at 5:22 a.m (0522 GMT) on four of the islands
which lie 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) west of Portugal, the radio
reported.
	   Civil Protection Services were also alerted on the islands of
Pico, Sao Jorge and Terceira, where the U.S. Air Force has a base,
RDP said.
	   The Azores have a total population of about 250,000, most of
whom make their living from agriculture. The islands have been hit
by earthquakes in the past, with 49 people killed and some 300
injured in one of the worst tremors in 1980.

Italy's coalition government partners meet to heal divisions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Premier Romano Prodi sat down with his coalition
partners Thursday to try to heal divisions within his center-left
government.
	   Prodi called the talks after the Communist Refoundation party,
which is outside the coalition but gives Prodi a majority in the
Chamber of Deputies, refused last month to back the government on a
bill for NATO's eastward expansion. The measure passed with the
support of a centrist opposition party.
	   The Communists, led by Fausto Bertinotti, are demanding stronger
strategies to combat unemployment in exchange for continued
support.
	   However, they have said they would back Prodi in any confidence
vote, making any imminent government collapse or early elections,
unlikely.
	   ``We don't want elections. We want a change of course,''
Bertinotti told La Repubblica daily.
	   The Communists main requests are a 35-hour work week and a new
agency to help create jobs in Italy's lesser developed south where
unemployment is twice the national rate of 12.5 percent.
	   Prodi has said that if a strong coalition does not emerge from
the talks, he won't lead another one.
	   The government is expected to present the results of the
consultations to parliament Wednesday, possibly triggering a vote
of confidence.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Further marking an economic slowdown, exports _ a
driving force in China's economy _ rose a sluggish 7.6 percent in
the first half of the year, state media reported Thursday.
	   The anemic export growth underscores China's vulnerability to
Asia's lingering financial turmoil and could strengthen Chinese
resistance to making market-opening concessions at World Trade
Organization talks later this month.
	   While six-month exports totaled dlrs 86.97 billion, the 7.6
percent growth rate from January-June 1997 pales next to the 21
percent posted for all of 1997. The rate also indicated a dim June.
Exports grew 8.6 percent in the first five months of the year.
	   Imports rose 2.2 percent in the year's first half to dlrs 64.43
billion, leaving China with a dlrs 22.25 billion trade surplus,
according to customs figures released by the Xinhua News Agency.
	   Declining exports make it more difficult for Chinese leaders to
meet their target of 8 percent economic growth this year. The
threshold is seen as critical to creating new jobs and staving off
unrest among millions of workers being laid off from inefficient,
bankrupt state industries.
	   Higher tax rebates, increased financing and other measures taken
to spur exports may have limited results given continued economic
woes in the region, especially in Japan, a key investor and export
market.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia has to restructure its
financial sector to make banks more competitive and efficient but
won't open further to foreigners, a senior Finance Ministry
official said Thursday.
	   ``Without painful (financial sector) reforms, we will not be
able to overcome this current economic crisis,'' said Deputy
Finance Minister Affifuddin Omar.
	   Affifuddin's comments in a speech were a rare official
acknowledgment of the need to improve the domestic financial
industry.
	   While independent analysts have said the shaky financial sector
was responsible for the Malaysian currency's sharp decline,
government leaders have accused Western investors of orchestrating
speculative attacks on the ringgit for quick profit.
	   But Affifuddin also said there were no plans to open banking
further to overseas companies.
	   ``Under the World Trade Organization treaty, we are supposed to
allow it but the government has to slow down the process of
allowing (increased) foreign equity to come in,'' he said.
	   Malaysian banks needed more time to prepare for competition, he
said. ``We don't want foreigners to swarm in and flood our
financial markets. We will be colonized.''

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Explaining recent government moves to
ease monetary policy, Bank of Thailand Governor Chatu Mongol
Sonakul said keeping short-term interest rates too high for too
long damages Thailand's prospects for recovery.
	   The bank has begun slowly pushing down rates that last month
were around 19 percent. They were raised last year in an effort to
strengthen the baht as Asia's economies melted down.
	   Tight money policy was mandated in a dlrs 17.2 billion bailout
organized by the International Monetary Fund. Many Thais believe
the original conditions were too strict and crippled any chance of
recovery by throttling growth.
	   Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda said this week that the
IMF has agreed ``in principle'' that expansionary policies are now
appropriate given the relative exchange-rate stability.
	   Increasing short-term rates is the most powerful tool at the
central bank's disposal, Chatu Mongkol told foreign correspondents
Wednesday night.
	   High interest rates alone hinder a solution to the mountain of
bad debt held by the country's financial institutions, he said.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Asian Development Bank said
Thursday it has granted a dlrs 300 million package of loans to fund
poverty-alleviation projects in Indonesia.
	   ``The current economic crisis in Indonesia is expected to force
hundreds of thousands of poor children to drop out of school,
thousands of pregnant women to be unable to receive adequate
prenatal care and thousands of infants to receive poor nutrition,''
the Manila-based bank said.
	   The bank said the loans will ``help mitigate the impact of the
crisis on the poor.''
	   The loans will be administered by the Social Protection Sector
Development Program, which was formed by the Indonesian government
and the ADB. The program aims to protect essential social services
in areas such as education, health, nutrition and family planning.
	   The ADB noted that Indonesia's poverty rate declined between
1973 and 1996 from 40 percent to 11 percent of the population.
	   ``However, the current crisis threatens these achievements,'' it
said in a statement.
	   The depreciation of the rupiah, high inflation, soaring
unemployment and a recession have driven large numbers of people
below the poverty line this year.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korean defense contractors are
close to trading six military patrol boats to Qatar in exchange for
more than dlrs 200 million worth of liquefied petroleum gas,
officials said Thursday.
	   ``Both sides have come to an understanding on the barter
proposal,'' a Defense Ministry official said, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
	   South Korea imports 80 percent of its liquefied petroleum gas
needs from Qatar, a Persian Gulf country.
	   Officials at Daewoo and Hyundai refused to discuss the deal,
which would be worth three times South Korea's total weapons
exports last year.
	   Daewoo recently won a dlrs 100 million contract to build a
2,300-ton frigate for the Bangladesh navy, according to domestic
news media. Hyundai sold a naval patrol ship to Bangladesh in 1995.
	    &UR; ___
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Sales of passenger cars in the
Philippines fell sharply in the first half of 1998 as a result of
Asia's currency crisis and tighter credit policies, an industry
group said Thursday.
	   The Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers of the Philippines Inc.
said car sales from January to June plunged 51 percent from the
same period last year to 20,036.
	   In June alone, sales fell 57 percent from last year to 2,888, it
said.
	   In addition to the effects of the currency crisis and credit
crunch, the association said more car repossessions by banks and
financing companies have increased the number of used cars
available and turned buyers away from new vehicles.
	   The association said it may further cut its car sales target for
the year, which now stands at 51,000, because of the
deeper-than-expected decline in car sales in the first half.
	   The industry sold 75,707 passengers cars last year.

Indonesia's ex-president denies having money overseas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Former President Suharto has denied
accusations by critics that he has money stashed away in overseas
banks.
	   The 77-year-old former leader, who resigned in May following
protests and riots, said that if the allegations were proved, he
would hand the money over to the state.
	   ``I don't have any accounts abroad at all,'' Suharto said in a
statement released Thursday by Yayasan Dharmais, one of several
charity foundations he heads.
	   Under Suharto, foundations linked to him reaped a special tax on
civil servants and enjoyed other privileges.
	   Now they are being investigated amid accusations that the
Suharto clan had illegally accumulated wealth.
	   His successor, President B.J. Habibie, recently revoked state
benefits for the foundations.
	   In the statement, Suharto said the foundations were set up to
help the poor, orphans, elderly, homeless and disabled, as well as
improving religious facilities for Muslims.
	   State Secretary Akbar Tanjung said Wednesday that the attorney
general's office would audit the foundations within three or four
months.
	   Tanjung said the results of the audit would decide whether the
government took over the foundations or left them to be managed by
Suharto.
	   Opponents of Suharto have said that the former president and his
family used their position and power to build fortunes during his
32 years in power.
	   Forbes magazine last month estimated Suharto's family was worth
dlrs 4 billion.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ No adjective was too strong Thursday as French
media swaddled the home team with rapturous elogies after France
defeated Croatia to win a berth in the World Cup final.
	   No matter what the result of Sunday's game with Brazil, the
conservative daily Le Figaro predicted a ``sumptuous final'' for a
team the newspaper said already has become a ``legend.''
	   The leftist daily Liberation, which devoted no less than eight
pages to covering the semifinal match, said Sunday's game
represented the ``dream final.''
	   Noel Le Graet, president of France's National Football League,
said it was a ``fantastic'' victory. ``French sport was waiting for
this final. The players achieved it. The coach was right. He put
together a very, very solid group.''
	   Even French intellectuals chimed in, reflecting the World Cup
mania that is sweeping the country and unifying the nation.
	   ``A magnificent match,'' Erik Orsenna, a member of the Academie
Francaise, told RTL radio Thursday morning.
	   Aime Jacquet, the dour French coach who is often criticized for
having sacrificed style in favor of a steady, sure defense, won
praise for leading France to a World Cup final for the first time.
	   ``Bravo!'' crowed the national sports daily, L'Equipe in paying
tribute to the French team, fullback Lilian Thuram, whose two goals
put France in the final as well as Jacquet.
	   ``Historic'' said L'Est Republicain newspaper. In its editorial,
the regional daily lauded Jacquet. ``We have discovered a man who
is firm, ardent, with clear ideas.
	   Le Graet praised Jacquet's tactics and the way he plans game
strategy.
	   Michel Hidalgo, a former coach of the French national team, said
Jacquet had achieved ``something exceptional.''
	   ``Not only does he have good players, not only the best players,
but he has done something more difficult, he has put together what
seems to be the best team,'' Hidalgo told Radio Monte Carlo.

Singapore union: Get any job before things get worse
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singaporeans who have lost jobs in the economic
downturn should take any available job before things get worse, a
Singapore union leader said Thursday.
	   Seng Harn Thong of the National Trade Union Congress urged
retrenched workers to take any job they can and then switch to
better jobs when the economy recovers, Singapore TV reported.
	   But he added that the worst is yet to come.
	   Though the unemployment rate in this island-republic of 3.1
million is still low at 2.2 percent, the number of job openings has
dropped by 44 percent as compared to last year.
	   Lim Boon Heng, chief of the National Trade Union Congress, said
earlier the number of workers losing their jobs will probably
exceed the peak of 20,000 during the 1985-86 recession.
	   Seng said those currently unemployed should also look at jobs
that were shunned before, including those performed by foreign
workers. He was referring to low-skilled jobs traditionally taken
by immigrant workers from poorer countries in the region.
	   Last June, another union leader urged Singaporean women to lower
their standards in choosing work, paying less attention to working
conditions, distance from home and working hours.

Chechen police try, but fail to free kidnapped British couple
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Acting on a tip that proved false, Chechen
authorities tried _ and failed _ to free two British charity
workers who have been held for more than a year in the breakaway
republic, a news report said.
	   Chechnya's anti-kidnapping forces went on mission to free the
couple early Thursday, but the tip they received did not check out,
and the pair could not be located, the deputy chief of Chechnya's
anti-abduction squad, Sharpudi Tasuyev, told the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   The two Britons, Camilla Carr and Jon James are ``alive and
unharmed,'' Tasuyev said. But the kidnappers have thrown police off
the track by frequently moving them, he said.
	   The report provided no further details of the police operation.
	   The British couple, seized on July 4, 1997, were on a charitable
mission in Chechnya with a Quaker affiliate, The Center for
Peacemaking and Community Development.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov has offered a dlrs 100,000
reward for information about their whereabouts.
	   Since its 1994-96 war to secede from Russia, Chechnya has been
plagued by soaring crime, including a wave of kidnappings of
Russians and foreigners motivated by ransom.
	   The anti-abduction squad has freed seven kidnap victims over the
past two weeks, including a Russian woman and an Armenian
businessman, Tasuyev said.
	   However, about 60 abduction victims are still in captivity and
authorities are unable to prevent further kidnappings. Among those
being held is main Russian envoy to the region.

British tourist sentenced to 14 years for child molesting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A 49-year-old British tourist was
sentenced Thursday to up to 14 years in prison on charges of
molesting an 8-year-old Filipino girl while talking with her
mother.
	   Manila regional court Judge Lorenzo Veneracion said John Pidden
of Old Bilton, Rugby, was guilty of ``causing danger and prejudice
to the normal growth and development of the child'' and ordered him
deported after he completes the prison term.
	   Veneracion said he supports the government's policy of
encouraging foreign tourists, but ``cannot allow and will never
allow undesirable aliens ... to abuse the innocence of our
children.''
	   According to the mother's testimony, Pidden approached her and
her daughter at a kiosk in Manila's Rizal Park last August and sat
next to them at a table. Her daughter started to squirm, and when
Pidden was away buying cigarettes told her that he had been
touching her leg and thigh, she said.
	   The mother said they tried to leave but Pidden followed and
cursed them. They asked for help from a taxi driver, who beat up
Pidden, she said.
	   Pidden pleaded innocent in the trial and said he had been framed
by the mother to obtain money. But the judge rejected the defense,
saying there was no evidence that the mother had asked for any
money.
	   He sentenced Pidden to between 12 years and 14 years and 8
months in prison and also ordered him to pay his victim 100,000
pesos (dlrs 2,440) in damages.
	   Last August, the Philippines signed agreements with Britain to
fight child sexual abuse. It also has signed a similar agreement
with Australia.
	   The Philippines is among the top Asian targets of pedophiles
from Australia, Europe, North America and Japan, partly because of
widespread poverty, weak law enforcement and corruption among some
officials.

Algerian ambassador injured in car accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Algerian Ambassador Hamid Shabrah was
hospitalized with minor injuries and bruises he suffered in a car
accident near the Iraqi border, the Algerian Embassy said Thursday.
	   Shabrah, 45, was flown by helicopter to King Hussein Medical
City hospital in Amman after his car skidded and hit a pavement on
the desert highway linking Amman with Baghdad on Wednesday, said an
embassy spokeswoman.
	   Shabrah's driver, Othman Badawi, 35, was also injured in the
accident near the town of Safawi, 140 kilometers (85 miles)
northeast of Amman and halfway to the Iraqi border, the spokeswoman
said.
	   The ambassador was going to the border to receive Algerian Trade
Minister Abdel Hamid Bozaher, who was returning from Baghdad, Iraq
after a state visit, said the spokeswoman who cannot be identified
under briefing rules.
	   Shabrah was expected to be discharged Thursday, but will have to
spend at least two weeks at home to recuperate from a shoulder
bruise and cuts on the face, neck and shoulders, officials at King
Hussein hospital said.
	   Because U.N. sanctions ban flights in and out of Iraq, visitors
have to go there by road, usually through Jordan.

Sister of Australian bridge collapse victim meets Israeli

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The sister of an Australian athlete killed when
a footbridge collapsed at the opening ceremony of Israel's
Maccabiah Games last year sought the support Thursday of Israeli
President Ezer Weizman.
	   Yetty Bennet, 50, was one of four Australians who died after the
bridge over the Yarkon River collapsed last July 14. Dozens of
other team members were injured.
	   Bennet's sister and brother-in-law, Jeany and Andrew Simons,
came to Israel this week to watch the trial of five defendants
charged in connection with the collapse, and to ask for
compensation and a parliamentary inquiry into the tragedy.
	   ``We came away with a good feeling that he's very supportive,''
Jeany Simons said after the half-hour meeting with Weizman at his
Jerusalem residence.
	   The couple also met with Israeli members of parliament.
	   ``We are pleased by their attitude,'' Andrew Simons said. ``Any
help that we can get from anybody is appreciated.''
	   Dozens of lawsuits are expected to be filed by the victims'
families.
	   The Simons' Israeli lawyer, Avi Menschel, said he believes it is
Israel's responsibility to give the families a fair settlement,
``and not force them to fight over nickels and dimes for years in
different courts.''
	   ``These people were invited by Israel,'' he said. ``Israel gets
a lot of good publicity from the Maccabiah Games.''
	   Menschel would not disclose how big a settlement the families
are seeking. ``Nobody is trying to get rich,'' he said.
	   Menschel said the families have received ``a lot of sympathy''
from Israeli officials, but only in the past few days have they for
appeared to be addressing the question of compensation seriously.
	   ``Nobody is denying the families the right to a fair settlement,
but so far things are going too slow,'' he said.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is scheduled to travel to
Australia next month, has said he would finish looking into the
matter before he arrived, and said Israel wanted to help the
families of the victims as much as possible.

Postal workers go on strike in India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Mail piled up in post offices across
India on Thursday as 500,000 postal workers went on strike to
demand higher wages and bonuses, news reports said.
	   Representatives of workers' unions said they were forced to
strike because the federal government refused to discuss their
demands, the Press Trust of India news agency said.
	   Employees who deliver the mail got raises recently, and didn't
join the strike. But without workers to sort mail, there was little
for them to do.
	   Communications Minister Sushma Swaraj appealed to postal workers
Wednesday to be patient, saying the government was considering
their demands. Their specific wage demands were not immediately
available.

Ousted co-premier promises to seek justice after election
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONG RUSSEI, Cambodia (AP) _ While a funeral was held for one of
his murdered supporters, Prince Norodom Ranariddh promised Thursday
to bring the perpetrators of political violence to trial if he wins
elections July 26.
	   Speaking to a crowd of 2,000 in the northwestern province of
Battambang, the prince said he wanted to find justice for those who
were ``brutally murdered'' after he was ousted as co-prime minister
by strongman Hun Sen in a bloody takeover last year.
	   Opponents of Hun Sen say he is trying to ensure victory in
Cambodia's upcoming polls by using violence, including murder, and
intimidation, plus rigging the electoral machinery in his favor.
	   At least six opposition members have died in political killings
since the electoral campaign began last month. Additionally, human
rights workers say that as many as 100 supporters of Ranariddh's
royalist FUNCINPEC party were killed after his ouster.
	   There have been no arrests by the Hun Sen-controlled legal
machinery in any of the cases.
	   ``I promise to find the culprits and send them to trial. This is
FUNCINPEC's commitment,'' Ranariddh said.
	   A funeral was held near Phnom Penh for FUNCINPEC activist Thong
Sophal, 45, whose body was discovered by police two weeks ago.
	   Thong Sophal's fingers and left ear were cut off and he had been
struck a massive blow to the left side of his head. Authorities
immediately labeled the death a suicide, but human rights workers
said it was political and the injuries suggested torture.
	   Meanwhile, the opposition party headed by dissident Sam Rainsy
reported the death of a party official, Hun Thai, who was shot
while riding his motorbike Tuesday in the southeastern province of
Takeo.
	   Party officials were not yet sure if the killing was political.
	   Hun Sen, who has been Cambodia's most powerful politician since
the mid-1980s, has called the elections to win back international
aid and legitimacy lost because of his takeover.
	   Ranariddh, who was driven into exile by the pitched battles in
the capital, was allowed to return in March following diplomatic
pressure on Hun Sen.
	   In 1993, Ranariddh emerged the winner in U.N.-sponsored polls
backed by thousands of peacekeeping troops, but Hun Sen forced his
way into a coalition by threatening civil war.
	   This time, United Nations assistance is limited to observers and
technical aid.

Earthquake strikes Azores Islands, killing five

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ An earthquake jolted Portugal's Azores
Islands in the Atlantic Ocean just before dawn Thursday, causing
houses to collapse and people to flee into the streets. At least
five people were killed and 30 injured, rescue workers said.
	   The quake had a magnitude of 5.8 and its epicenter was in the
Atlantic Ocean, 15 kilometers (10 miles) northeast of the island of
Faial, one of the group's nine volcanic islands, a spokesman for
Portugal's National Seismological Institute on the archipelago told
The Associated Press.
	   By midmorning the death toll was at five, Henela Vaz, a
spokeswoman for the Azores Civil Protection Service, said by phone
from Terceira island.
	   She played down the importance of the quake.
	   ``This is a normal event in the Azores. We have quakes every
year,'' Vaz said.
	   Three people were dead on arrival at the main hospital in Horta,
the capital of Faial, Dr. Jorge Camara, the hospital's clinical
director said. About 30 others were injured, five of them
seriously, he added.
	   It was not clear if the other two deaths took place also on
Faial, the island hardest hit by the quake.
	   Injured people were being ferried to the hospital by helicopters
because many roads were closed by debris, Camara said.
	   The quake was felt at 5:22 a.m. (0522 GMT) on four of the
islands which lie 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) west of Portugal,
Portuguese state radio RDP reported.
	   Civil Protection Services were also alerted on the islands of
Pico, Sao Jorge and Terceira, where the U.S. Air Force has a base,
RDP said.
	   Gregory Adams, a spokesman at the U.S. Embassy in Lisbon, said
there was no damage reported at the force base.
	   The Azores have a total population of about 250,000, most of
whom make their living from agriculture. The islands have been hit
by earthquakes in the past, with 49 people killed and some 300
injured in one of the worst tremors in 1980.

Road rage suspected in shooting of Bangkok taxi driver
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Police said Thursday a taxi driver
killed with an M-16 assault rifle on a major Bangkok road may have
been the victim of a motorist whose car he had accidentally bumped.
	   Noi Meechai, 43, was found dead in his taxi Wednesday after it
crashed into a wall, police said. Police discovered he had been
shot only after they investigated reports of a road accident.
	   Some of the damage on Noi's auto, including scrapes of paint
from another vehicle, appeared to have been caused slightly before
the final crash, police said.
	   Noi was shot several times in the head, and his car also had
bullet holes in it, police said.
	   Police said friends of the victim described him as a
mild-mannered man not known to be in conflict with anyone.

Olympic swimming star suspended after positive marijuana test
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with USA Today report; RECASTS throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By BOB BAUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHOENIX (AP) _ Olympic gold medalist Gary Hall Jr. says he will
fight the international swimming federation's decision to suspend
him from competition because of a positive marijuana test.
	   FINA announced its suspension in its newsletter, even though
Hall has yet to take the second drug test or appear at a hearing
that will determine the length of the penalty or whether it will be
revoked.
	   ``I am confident that once I am afforded the opportunity to
present my position, I will be able to prove I did not violate any
FINA rule and the provisional suspension will be removed,'' Hall
said Wednesday in a statement released by his agent.
	   Hall, who withdrew from this month's Goodwill Games in New York,
noted in his statement that marijuana is a ``non-performance
enhancing substance.''
	   Gunnar Werner, FINA's honorary secretary, told USA Today that
Hall also tested positive for marijuana during the 1996 Atlanta
Olympics. ``We do not temporarily suspend on the first offense for
marijuana,'' Werner said.
	   FINA's rules call for a maximum three-month suspension for a
first marijuana offense, while a second offense carries a
suspension of three months to two years.
	   USA Today said Hall is expected to challenge FINA's stance that
this is his second offense. FINA added marijuana to its banned list
just before the Atlanta Games, but the rule did not take effect
until after the competition.
	   Hall, 23, said the positive test was conducted May 15 at the
U.S. West-Nortel Swimfest in Phoenix, an event that wasn't
sanctioned by FINA. He plans to undergo a second test next week at
the International Olympic Committee's laboratory in Montreal.
	   Four Chinese swimmers were provisionally suspended for testing
positive for masking agents during last year's world championships,
but the suspension was lifted after they argued in a hearing that
they had used only traditional Chinese herbs that had caused the
positive test results.
	   Hall was in Hawaii and unavailable for comment, but spokesman
Phil Whitten said the swimmer was ``very, very upset,'' especially
because of the ramifications the suspension could have.
	   If Hall still is on suspension in August, and if the U.S.
championships that month are considered an international meet by
FINA, he would be banned from that competition.
	   The August championships will determine most of the U.S. roster
for 1999 international competition. However, rules could allow Hall
to be added to the U.S. contingent later.
	   Hall won gold medals as part of the U.S. 400-meter freestyle and
400 medley relay teams in the Atlanta Games. He also won silver
medals, finishing second to Russia's Alexander Popov in the 50 and
100 freestyle.
	   Whitten said only one swimmer, Scott Miller of Australia, has
been suspended for marijuana use. Miller, silver medalist in the
100 butterfly at Atlanta, was suspended for two months early this
year.
	   Charlie Snyder, spokesman for U.S. Swimming, said the federation
would have no comment because the second test and hearing have yet
to be conducted.

South Korean foreign minister to visit China, Mongolia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korean Minister of Foreign
Affairs and Trade Park Chung-soo left Thursday to visit China and
Mongolia to strengthen relations with those countries.
	   Park will first visit Ulan Bator for two days of talks with his
Mongolian counterpart, R. Amarjargal. He also will meet President
N. Bagabandi and Prime Minister T. Elbegdorj.
	   Park goes to China on Saturday for three days of meetings with
President Jiang Zemin, Premier Zhu Rongji and Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan.
	   Park will seek Beijing's support for South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung's policy of expanding contacts and cooperation with North
Korea, ministry officials said.
	   He also will stress the importance of the Chinese currency's
stability in resolving Asia's financial crisis, they added.
	   China, the only major communist ally of Seoul's rival, North
Korea, opened formal diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992.
	   Trade between the two countries has since grown significantly,
reaching dlrs 23 billion in 1997.
	   Trade between Mongolia and South Korea reached dlrs 28 million
in 1997.

Mubarak leaves for Libya to meet with recuperating Gadhafi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak left for
neighboring Libya Thursday to meet with Libyan leader Col. Moammar
Gadhafi who is recovering from a hip operation, officials said.
	   Mubarak is traveling in an aircraft with several ministers and
senior aides, said the officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   It was not clear if Mubarak will fly all the way to the north
African country _ in defiance of a U.N. air embargo _ or land at an
Egyptian military air base near the Libyan border and travel by
road from there.
	   The air embargo was imposed in 1992 after Gadhafi refused to
hand over two Libyans suspected in the 1988 bombing of an American
airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland that killed 270 people.
	   Gadhafi, 56, broke a hip bone while exercising on Tuesday and he
underwent surgery to repair the hip the same day. He is in good
condition and has resumed normal work, the Libyan official news
agency JANA said Wednesday.
	   Mubarak has visited Libya many times since 1992 but has always
driven across the Egyptian-Libyan border.
	   Last month, the Organization of African Unity urged member
states to ignore the sanctions for visits with humanitarian and
religious implications or those relating to official OAU work.
	   But apart from Libya only Chad and Niger have heeded the call so
far and Gadhafi twice canceled a visit to Egypt last month,
apparently angered by Egypt's refusal to let him fly to Cairo.

Big Puerto Rican strike begins with bang, fizzles down to scuffles

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico _ It started with a dramatic blockade of
the main airport, a bomb and the strafing of a bank.
	   Then the biggest protest in Puerto Rico's history fizzled to
picket line scuffles with police and an ax attack on a telephone
pole.
	   A 48-hour general strike to protest the sale of the state
telephone company united Puerto Ricans like few other issues in a
century of U.S. rule, union leaders and opposition politicians
said.
	   It ended Wednesday night in the rhetoric of rallies by
``independentistas,'' whose stand in favor of independence for the
U.S. commonwealth is supported by fewer than 8 percent of Puerto
Ricans, according to a recent poll.
	   A Newspaper Guild official recited a poem urging islanders ``to
resist those from abroad,'' at the biggest rally in San Juan.
Lolita Lebron, the unrepentant militant who led a 1954 armed attack
on the U.S. House of Representatives, wounding five lawmakers, also
delivered a speech.
	   Labor leaders on Thursday were to discuss ending the
three-week-old walkout by the telephone company's 6,400 workers,
which inspired the massive general strike.
	   They are considering a change of tactics, including periodic
one-day walkouts, said Annie Cruz, leader of the Independent
Brotherhood of Telephone Employees.
	   ``We won't go (back to work). Not after what happened here,''
said Aida L. Rivera Marrero, a union delegate in an office park
where riot police clubbed protesters three weeks ago.
	   The strikers failed to budge Gov. Pedro Rossello, whom they want
to hold a referendum on the dlrs 1.9 billion sale of Puerto Rico
Telephone Co. to a consortium led by GTE Corp. of Stamford,
Connecticut.
	   Rossello said the only referendum would be one on the status of
the island; the U.S. House of Representatives has already approved
such a referendum and the Senate is discussing the matter.
	   Union leaders accuse the governor of ``selling the national
patrimony'' in his campaign to make the island the 51st state of
the union. Statehood supporters say the strike is aimed at
presenting Puerto Rico as an unstable and unfriendly prospect for
statehood and dissuading foreign investment in Rossello's ambitious
privatization plans.
	   GTE is undeterred, spokeswoman Sharon Cohen-Hagar said
Wednesday, and intends to go ahead with the acquisition.
	   Rossello has said that state companies cannot compete in a newly
deregulated world. The telephone company slashed rates last year,
but a call to California still costs about a third what it costs to
call across the island (34 cents a minute).
	   Union leaders said 200,000 government employees stayed away from
work, along with another 300,000 islanders. But the government
claimed that 80 percent of its 300,000 employees worked through the
strike.
	   On Tuesday, bomb threats closed major shopping malls, protesters
blockaded the airport and a bank was strafed by gunfire.
	   The protests petered out Wednesday. A picket line at Eli Lilly's
pharmaceutical plant, one of the island's biggest employers, barely
affected operations. Saboteurs also appeared to lose steam _
mustering only an ax attack on a telephone poll and damage to an
electrical transformer.

<TEXT>
	   NAGOYA, Japan (AP) _ Wakanohana and Takanohana, sumo's first
brother yokozunas (grand champions), shared the lead with
Hawaiian-born Musashimaru after winning their fifth straight bouts
Thursday in the 15-day Nagoya Grand Sumo Tournament.
	   One victory behind at 4-1 were yokozuna Akebono from Hawaii,
ozeki (champion) Takanonami and five other wrestlers, including
sekiwake (junior champion) Chiyotaikai and No. 5 maegashira (senior
wrestler) Tochiazuma.
	   New yokozuna Wakanohana toppled winless No. 3 maegashira Gojoro
by pulling his head.
	   Takanohana forced out winless No. 2 maegashira Tochinonada, who
attacked him with a series of arm throw attempts.
	   Ozeki Musashimaru, or Fiamalu Penitani, held off No. 3
maegashira Shikishima's pushing attempts at the ring's edge, drove
him back and sent him out, leaving Shikishima at 2-3.
	   Akebono, or Chad Rowan, grabbed No. 2 maegashira Musoyama's belt
and bulldozed him out, handing Musoyama his third defeat against
two victories.
	   Takanonami lifted winless No. 1 maegashira Oginishiki to the
ring's edge and sent him out.
	   No. 1 maegashira Takatoriki thrust out Tochiazuma for his second
victory against three defeats, and komusubi (junior champion second
class) Kaio threw down Chiyotaikai for his first victory against
four defeats.
	   No. 11 maegashira Kyokushuzan, or Mongolian Batbayar Davaa, was
sent out from behind by No. 10 maegashira Tamakasuga for his third
defeat against two victories. Tamakasuga is 3-2.
	   No. 15 maegashira Kyokutenho, or Mongolian Tsevegnyam Nyamjav,
forced out No. 13 maegashira Kotoryu, leaving both at 2-3.
	   In makushita, the top junior division, No. 2-ranked Hoshitango
(2-1), or Argentine Imach Marcelo Salomon, pulled down No. 3-ranked
Kotokanryu.
	   No. 50-ranked Ikemori (0-3), or Brazilian Luis Go Ikemori, was
driven out by No. 49-ranked Tatsukabuto.
	   In sandanme, the second-highest junior division, No. 65-ranked
Azumakaze (2-1), or Brazilian Tussato Guiuliano Kotinda, threw down
No. 68-ranked Wakaseiryu.
	   Wrestlers in junior divisions have only seven bouts during the
15-day tournament.

Russia holds key talks with lenders on new loan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with meeting between Russia and international lenders,
CHANGES byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's lead negotiator held a key round of talks
Thursday with international lenders in an effort to secure a huge
loan that could help stabilize the country's battered markets.
	   Russia wants dlrs 10 billion to 15 billion in new loans to
restore confidence in financial markets that have been in a
tailspin for months.
	   Anatoly Chubais, Russia's representative in the talks, met
Thursday with officials from both the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund and said the negotiations were in a
``decisive'' stage.
	   The parties agree on the broad outline of a bailout package,
Chubais said following talks Tuesday. But the IMF and the World
Bank may be reluctant to finalize any loan deal until Russia's
parliament approves an economic stabilization package proposed by
President Boris Yeltsin's administration.
	   Parliament's lower house is not scheduled to meet again until
July 15, and the Communists and other opposition members have
strong reservations about measures that would raise taxes.
	   Russia's government has chronic problems in collecting taxes,
and the IMF has on several occasions withheld money on an existing
loan because the government hasn't been able to raise sufficient
revenues.
	   The government would like the loan as soon as possible to deal
with a wide range of problems. Millions of workers have to wait
months for their salaries. Labor unrest is on the rise. The Russian
stock market has fallen by more than half so far this year, and
foreign investors are fleeing in droves.
	   Thursday's talks focused on a structural adjustment loan from
the World Bank that would give the Russian government dlrs 600
million to dlrs 800 million in budget support, officials said.
	   Chubais also plans to hold talks with the International Monetary
Fund on Friday. An IMF mission is in Moscow for a second week, and
its representatives were also present for Thursday's session.
	   Russia says it needs at least dlrs 10 billion to stabilize its
markets, but would like as much as dlrs 15 billion.
	   So far, the current crisis has been restricted largely to the
stock and bond markets. But there's increasing pressure on the
Russian currency, and if the ruble is devalued, prices would rise
an all Russians would feel the pinch.
	   Before the crisis, the government had been predicting economic
growth of about 2 percent this year. That would have been Russia's
strongest showing this decade. But now the economy is flat, and may
even contract this year, according to most forecasts.

<TEXT>
	   YOKOHAMA, Japan (AP) _ Candidate Marutei Tsurunen is campaigning
on an unusual issue in Japan's elections this Sunday: his genes.
	   Tsurunen, running for a seat in the upper house of parliament in
this Tokyo suburb, was born in Finland _ a fact he trumpets at
campaign stops and in voter pamphlets.
	   ``How about a Parliament member with blue eyes?'' Tsurunen asks
in a handout that shows him clutching chopsticks over a lunch like
a Japanese flag _ with a huge red plum in the middle of a square of
white rice.
	   If elected, the 58-year-old former Lutheran missionary _ and
Japanese citizen for 19 years _ will be the first Westerner to hold
national office in Japan. Naturalized Asians have already held
office.
	   A campaign with such an obvious difference is usually a sure
formula for disaster in conformist Japan. But it could prove a boon
in the balloting for 126 seats at a time when voters have never
been more disenchanted with status quo politics.
	   Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's government has been powerless
before a downward spiraling economy. Unemployment is at a record
4.1 percent. Top banks are crippled with massive bad debts. And
there seems no end in sight to the corruption scandals involving
the highest ranks of government.
	   ``Most of you don't support any political parties, and you have
given up,'' Tsurunen said in fluent Japanese at a bustling train
station in Yokohama. His supporters handed out leaflets urging
voters to ``import a lawmaker direct from the land of Santa
Claus.''
	   ``My mission is to represent your views,'' said Tsurunen, whose
original name was Martti Turnen. He took a Japanese-sounding name
as a requirement to become a citizen.
	   Tsurunen, an independent city assemblyman outside of Tokyo since
1992, is promising a gentler welfare-oriented society and cleaner
government. He argues that offering financial security in old age
will do wonders for the economy and boost consumer spending.
	   More than anything else, one message is clear _ the ex-foreigner
from northern Karelia in eastern Finland is definitely different.
	   ``We need a new view from a different country,'' said
50-year-old retired architect Noriko Iwamoto. ``Then Japanese
politics might change.''
	   ``He is not just some old man who likes Japan,'' said campaign
volunteer Rika Nishida, a 21-year-old student. ``His ideas reflect
common sense. He takes the viewpoint of the regular person.''
	   A major problem faced by candidates this year is the same in
other recent elections: getting out the vote. Opinion polls by
Japanese media predict voters are likely to sit at home, too
discouraged to show faith in any politician.
	   Government officials have been so worried about voter turnout
they have changed election laws _ extending balloting hours from 5
p.m to 8 p.m. and loosening absentee-balloting restrictions.
	   Regardless of the election results, the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party is in no danger of losing its grip on the
government because it controls the more powerful lower house with
264 of 500 seats.
	   Tsurunen, who fell short in a 1995 bid for the upper house by
30,000 votes in the 6.6 million-voter three-seat Kanagawa district,
is again on the borderline, according to Japanese media.
	   At the train station, many didn't take his leaflets.
	   ``I don't think a naturalized foreigner should handle politics
because it's about Japan. Not that a pure Japanese can do anything
either,'' said one young man, who refused to give his name.
	   But 21-year-old Ryosuke Katakura is convinced Japan is ready for
change.
	   ``He will be a breath of fresh air,'' he said after waving to
Tsurunen.

Philippine stocks fall, peso declines on weaker yen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with peso weakening further in afternoon trading &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine peso fell against the
U.S. dollar Thursday, pressured by the weaker Japanese yen and
dollar-buying by domestic corporations that expect the peso to
decline further, dealers said.
	   Stocks, meanwhile, were hounded by profit-taking as the market
grappled for a better handle on developments in Japan, traders
said.
	   The dollar averaged 41.685 pesos for the day, compared to 41.397
pesos on Wednesday. It went as high as 41.850 pesos and was last
traded at 41.800 pesos.
	   A trader with a foreign bank said concern over the rising
government budget deficit and inflation were also weighing on
investor sentiment toward the peso.
	   With numerous adverse factors affecting the peso, the currency
was expected to extend its losses Friday, testing the key level of
42 pesos to the dollar.
	   In stock trading, the 30-issue Philippine Stock Exchange Index
fell 29.10 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,828.40 after inching down
2.82 points Wednesday.
	   The broader All Shares Index fell 6.69 points to 570.0 following
a marginal 0.02-point gain Wednesday. Losers beat gainers 60 to 28,
with 39 issues unchanged.
	   ``What we saw was profit-taking,'' said Jose Vistan Jr., analyst
for Dharmala Securities.
	   He said investors were ``trying to see a clearer direction for
the region'' given the latest announcement of tax cuts in Japan.
Japan's elections Sunday will probably provide a better picture of
where the region's largest economy is headed, he said.
	   Trisha Jocson, analyst for Kim Eng Securities, said the market
ignored the gains posted overnight by the Dow Jones Industrial
Average and focused more on news from the region.
	   Vistan said Japan will continue to be a major factor in the
market's direction given that corporate earnings are bound to be
disappointing.

Two bombs explode within minutes, two people injured
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Two bombs exploded within minutes of
each other Thursday in this port city, injuring two people, police
and hospital officials said.
	   Elsewhere in the city, a policeman and an activist of the ruling
Pakistan Muslim League, who lived in the same apartment building,
were taken from their homes by armed men, said family members.
	   Their bodies were found nearby in their south Karachi
neighborhood, police said.
	   No one took responsibility for the killings or the bombings.
	   One of the bombs ripped through a washroom in the offices of the
country's largest English-language newspaper, The Dawn. No one was
hurt in that explosion.
	   ''It frightened everyone,'' said Noel Monteiro, a Dawn reporter
who was in a nearby room when the bomb went off. ''Suddenly there
was smoke and everyone was running for cover.''
	   The other bomb was placed beneath a vehicle parked about 100
meters (yards) from the Dawn offices in a congested southern
district of Karachi.
	   Two passersby were injured by flying debris and taken to the
hospital, said officials at the scene.
	   So far police officers at the site said there was no evidence to
indicate the bombs were linked.
	   Karachi, a teeming city of 14 million people, has been wracked
by relentless violence.
	   Mostly the combatants have been members of rival factions of a
militant ethnic group, the Mohajir Qami Movement, representing
Muslims from India who settled in Pakistan after 1947.
	   It's not known whether the latest bombings were related to the
MQM's factional feud, which has claimed more than 200 lives since
June 1.

Health, security training of aid workers neglected, U.N. says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Emergency aid workers are often being put at
unnecessary risk by inadequate health and security training, the
United Nations health agency said Thursday.
	   A survey carried out among 200 relief workers in Rwanda, Uganda
and Tanzania identified hurried and casual recruitment procedures
as a major concern, the World Health Organization said in a
statement.
	   Workers for a range of organizations were questioned by WHO in
February this year.
	   ``It is not unusual for staff to arrive at duty stations without
having first had a medical exam, a personal medical kit or any
medical briefing,'' WHO said. Some 53 percent of interviewees had
received no briefing.
	   That contributes to a situation in which ``only half of the
sample felt that they were able to function well on the day that
they were interviewed.''
	   Around 20 percent reported suffering diarrhea or a related
disease in the two weeks before the interview and more than half
the sample had received no information on food safety, WHO said.
	   Staff felt they were being put in danger because ``briefing on
security issues and political matters appears to be especially
deficient.''
	   The lack of clear guidelines could lead to cases of staff
neglect being taken to court in future, the study concluded.
	   Although acknowledging that speed is important in recruiting
emergency staff, it regretted that many relief agencies leave
``little time for references or checking of references.'' Almost a
quarter of the WHO sample said they had not been asked to provide
references.

Villagers on alert after hot cloud spews from Indonesian volcano
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Villagers living on the slopes of one
of Indonesia's most active volcanoes were on alert Thursday after a
super-hot steam cloud gushed from its crater.
	   Volcanologists monitoring increased activity within Mount
Merapi, in central Java, said the cloud roared down the western
face of its cone for 750 meters (2,500 feet) Wednesday.
	   It caused no damage.
	   In 1994, a much larger steam cloud flattened a village farther
down the slope, killing 60 inhabitants and severely burning others.
	   The 2,968-meter (9,737-foot) mountain is the most active of 500
Indonesia volcanoes.
	   Atje Purbawinata, a volcanologist in the nearby city of
Yogyakarta, said small lava flows and tremors had been recorded
within the mountain, pointing to the possibility an eruption.
	   ``People are on alert. The situation can change very quickly,''
he said.
	   The volcano is 575 kilometers (360 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   In its most destructive eruption this century, Merapi killed
1,300 people in 1930.

Earthquake strikes Azores Islands, killing five

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ An earthquake shook Portugal's Azores
Islands in the Atlantic Ocean just before dawn Thursday, killing at
least five people and leaving several hundred homeless, news
reports said.
	   The quake had a magnitude of 5.8 and its epicenter was in the
Atlantic Ocean, 15 kilometers (10 miles) northeast of the island of
Faial, one of the group's nine volcanic islands, a spokesman for
Portugal's National Seismological Institute on the archipelago told
The Associated Press.
	   By midmorning the death toll was at five, Helena Vaz, a
spokeswoman for the Azores Civil Protection Service, said by phone
from Terceira island.
	   She played down the importance of the quake.
	   ``This is a normal event in the Azores. We have quakes every
year,'' Vaz said.
	   Footage broadcast on Portuguese state television RTP showed
partially collapsed houses and cars covered in debris from walls in
the village of Ribeirinha on Faial.
	   Families, including small children, were seen standing in the
streets in their nightwear in the bright morning sunshine. The
rural village has about 500 inhabitants.
	   Residents said the quake lasted between 15 and 20 seconds and
was followed by a series of minor aftershocks.
	   Some 1,000 people in the Azores were left homeless, according to
RTP.

Chinese police break up child abduction gang
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police in three Chinese provinces have broken up
a gang that abducted children for sale, arresting 13 people and
rescuing 21 children, the official Xinhua News Agency said
Thursday.
	   The children, all boys from southern Guizhou province, were 3 or
4 years old when they were kidnapped and sold in the coastal
provinces of Guangdong and Fujian for between 7,000 and 13,000
Chinese yuan (dlrs 845 and dlrs 1,570) each, Xinhua said.
	   Some of the children had been away from their parents for as
long as nine years, it said.
	   Police were continuing their search for other kidnappers who
escaped and for more abducted children, Xinhua said.
	   Kidnappers often sell children to families that want more kids
but are blocked by family planning policies that restrict many
Chinese couples to just one child. Sometimes the children are
bought to labor on farms or in mines.

40 get jail sentences for Thai Binh unrest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Forty people have been convicted and
sentenced for their roles in unrest over local corruption last year
that came to symbolize rural dissatisfaction in Vietnam.
	   The unrest led the central government to close off Thai Binh
province, south of Hanoi, for 10 months before taking foreign
journalists on a supervised tour there in February.
	   Officials have admitted that hundreds of people were involved in
protests that sometimes turned violent. In one incident, about 20
police officers were taken hostage, beaten up and denied food for
four days. Three were hospitalized
	   Those convicted in a mass trial that ended Saturday were accused
of abusing the fight against corruption for their own purposes and
provoking other people to riot.
	   Their penalties range from suspended sentences for eight people
to 11 1/2 years for the alleged ringleader.
	   ``We tried 40 people,'' a people's court official said by
telephone Thursday. ``They were charged with causing social
disorder, abusing power and illegal arrest.''
	   The Communist Party newspaper Nhan Dan called it ``an especially
serious case.''
	   The government has said it is sympathetic to the causes of the
unrest but that some protesters went too far.
	   Phan Huy Duyen, elected the new head of Quynh Hoa village on
Dec. 31 to replace an ousted corrupt official, told in February how
the community nearly disintegrated into anarchy.
	   He said local residents were frustrated when they tried to
petition the village, the commune, the district and finally the
province over discrepancies in financing projects.
	   The unrest hit several villages in Thai Binh, prompting the
central government to pursue legislation aimed at improving
grassroots democracy and accountability by officials. It has made
fighting corruption one of its top priorities.
	   But there have been reports of similar unrest breaking out in a
neighboring province this year.

Vietnam's prime minister demands improvements by state monopoly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Prime Minister Phan Van Khai has taken the
state electricity monopoly to task for abuse of power and excessive
bureaucracy while accusing it of overcharging, the newspaper Dau Tu
(Investment) reported Thursday.
	   In a blunt assessment, he ordered Electricity of Vietnam to help
cut waste that is driving up costs and could spark public
discontent. EVN must work out corrective measures based on his
instructions, and individual leaders have to do self-criticisms.
	   Khai said the utility has plenty of problems, particularly in
the tender process and project accounting, that have led to
complaints and affect Vietnam's reputation with foreign investors.
	   In March, former President Le Duc Anh, in an article for the
Army newspaper, criticized irregularities in the bidding process
for the country's largest thermal electric plant.
	   Local media have reported that the company has overblown the
costs for construction and repair work on a number of projects to
justify overcharging for electricity.
	   Vietnam is chronically short of power, and several projects to
raise its output are bogged down in bureaucracy.
	   EVN imposed rotating power cuts earlier this year as the worst
drought in a century dropped water levels to critical levels at the
reservoirs that feed key hydroelectric plants.

Jesus poster causes stir in German election campaign
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Bavaria's archconservative Christian Social
Union party wants Jesus out of this year's election campaign _ the
Jesus poster, that is.
	   The leftist Greens party unveiled the placard this week to
attack the anti-immigrant positions taken by the CSU, part of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's center-right government.
	   Under a picture of Jesus is the slogan: ``Beckstein would deport
Jesus, too,'' referring to Bavaria's hardline Interior Minister,
Guenther Beckstein.
	   Greens party leaders Ruth Paulig and Bernd Schreyer have
defended the poster, arguing that Jesus and his parents were
refugees and would be subject to deportation if they arrived in
Bavaria today.
	   But in an open letter Wednesday, they said they would consider
withdrawing it if CSU leader Alois Glueck pushed his party to
moderate its policies on refugees and immigrants.
	   Glueck responded with an open letter Thursday accusing the
Greens of defaming Beckstein with the poster and of seeking to
dictate which asylum policies are Christian and which aren't.
	   He also recommended to his party comrades that they boycott any
election event that includes Greens members.
	   Since the surprise victory of the far-right, anti-foreigner
German People's Union this spring in a state election, the CSU,
sister party to Kohl's Christian Democrats, has been sharpening its
right-wing credentials.
	   Party leaders, insisting Germany is not a land of immigration,
are demanding tougher asylum laws, quicker deportation of foreign
criminals and other measures to stem the flow of foreigners to
Germany.
	   Some 7 million foreigners, including hundreds of thousands of
refugees from the Balkans and elsewhere, live in Germany _ more
than any other European country.
	   Conscious of the growing appeal to many Germans of far-right
parties, who blame foreigners for Germany's high unemployment and
rising crime rates, Kohl on Wednesday gave his backing to a CSU
position paper titled ``Effective Stemming of Undesired
Immigration.''
	   Among other demands, the paper calls for limiting the number of
foreigners in public housing and requiring foreigners to learn more
German if they want to stay in the country.
	   But the CSU's stance met with sharp criticism from opposition
parties and even from the Free Democrats, junior partner in Kohl's
coalition government.
	   ``Not even the election is justification for adopting the
arguments of extreme-right organizations,'' said Sabine
Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, Kohl's former justice minister.
	   Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen, another Free Democrat legislator who
is also the government's commissioner for foreigners, said the CSU
with its proposals was ``wounding the limits of political
decency.''

Riot's wreckage still smoldering, Nigeria awakes to calm
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Lagos calm after a day of rioting. Edits
throughout to conform, trim. &QL; 
 &UR; By FRANK AIGBOGUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Tentatively, Nigerians began the day amid
an uneasy calm on Thursday after two tumultuous days of shock at
the death of Moshood Abiola that turned to rage and boiled over
into deadly rioting.
	   Abiola, the country's top political prisoner and the man many
hoped would become Nigeria's next civilian president, died Tuesday
while still imprisoned by the ruling military junta.
	   In response, rioters tore through parts of the commercial
capital of Lagos, the southern university town of Ibadan and
Abiola's hometown of Abeokuta. At least 19 people were killed in
the Wednesday violence.
	   Police used tear gas to quell the violence that began to ebb
Wednesday evening.
	   The streets were quiet Thursday morning, with many people
staying home and shops closed. The smoldering ruins of the mayhem,
piles of burning tires, were left along street corners.
	   On Wednesday, Nigeria's new military leader added to the
confusion situation by dissolving his Cabinet. However, Gen.
Abdulsalam Abubakar left untouched the country's Provisional Ruling
Council, the core of the junta that rules this oil-rich but
poverty-wracked nation.
	   He had inherited the Cabinet from dictator Gen. Sani Abacha. who
died June 8 of a heart attack.
	   Abubakar, in a nationwide television address Wednesday night,
called the death of Moshood Abiola a ``national tragedy'' and
appealed for calm.
	   ``Our national grief cannot be assuaged by recourse to
lawlessness,'' he said.
	   He made no mention of his plans for the Cabinet, though he said
that returning Nigeria to democracy was imperative.
	   Abiola, the apparent winner of 1993 presidential elections later
annulled by the military leadership, had been in prison since 1994.
He died Tuesday after suddenly falling ill during a meeting with
U.S. diplomats who were appealing for his freedom. He was 60.
	   A potent symbol of reform for Nigeria's poor masses, Abiola was
enormously popular in Nigeria's southwest, home of his Yoruba
ethnic group, where a growing number of people are blaming the
military for his death. The government said Abiola died of a heart
attack.
	   Col. Mohammed Marwa, the popular military administrator of Lagos
state, appealed for calm in an afternoon radio broadcast on
Wednesday.
	   ``Violence will not profit anyone,'' he said, adding: ``Only God
knows why He has taken Abiola away at this crucial period of
national reconciliation.''
	   Some of the violence was ethnic-based, with Yorubas from
Nigeria's southwest attacking Hausas. Hausas and Fulanis, both from
the north, make up a majority in the military and the junta.
	   While Abiola reportedly had been very ill last year, his death
came as a surprise, just days after U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan announced that all Nigeria's political prisoners would be
freed, including Abiola.
	   The U.S. State Department said there was no reason to believe
that Abiola's death was from anything other than natural causes.
	   But Abiola's family was suspicious, jaded by the oppressiveness
of the Abacha years.
	   ``I suspect that he was poisoned, that he was murdered,'' his
daughter Hafsat said in an interview.
	   Abubakar said in his speech that an autopsy would be conducted
in cooperation with the Abiola family, and that pathologists were
being flown in from the United States, Canada and the United
Kingdom.

Man drowns trying to save kids off Vancouver Island
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAMPBELL RIVER, British Columbia (AP) _ A man described as a
weak swimmer drowned trying to rescue two children adrift on a lake
near this Vancouver Island town.
	   The 31-year-old man, who was on a camping trip, plunged into
Upper Campbell Lake as an air mattress carrying the 6-year-old boy
and his 4-year-old sister was blown from shore, the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police said.
	   ``Both of the children had lifejackets on,'' said coroner Judith
McFarlane. ``The little boy jumped off and the little girl didn't
want to and she kept drifting off. The fellow went to rescue her
and he didn't make it.''
	   The children managed to reach the shore Tuesday, McFarlane said,
without elaborating.
	   The body of the man, who was not identified, was recovered
Wednesday morning.

Portuguese truck kills two Polish truck drivers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A Portuguese truck slammed into two Polish truck
drivers who were trying to fix their vehicle on a highway in
southwestern France, killing both men, police said Thursday.
	   The accident occurred shortly before dawn on the RN10 highway in
the Landes region of France as the two Poles tried to repair their
broken down truck.
	   The Portuguese driver hit the two Poles, who died soon
afterward. A blood test on the Portuguese chauffeur did not reveal
any traces of alcohol.
	   Traffic on the road, which links France to Spain, was seriously
disrupted for several hours.
	   The identities of the victims and the driver were not released.

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ An earthquake jolted Portugal's Azores
Islands in the Atlantic Ocean just before dawn Thursday, causing
houses to collapse and people to flee into the streets. At least
five people were killed and 30 injured, rescue workers said.
	   The quake had a magnitude of 5.8 and its epicenter was in the
Atlantic Ocean, 15 kilometers (10 miles) northeast of the island of
Faial, one of the group's nine volcanic islands, a spokesman for
Portugal's National Seismological Institute on the archipelago told
The Associated Press.
	   By midmorning the death toll had reached five, Henela Vaz, a
spokeswoman for the Azores Civil Protection Service, said by phone
from Terceira island.
	   Three people were dead on arrival at the main hospital in Horta,
the capital of Faial, Dr. Jorge Camara, the hospital's clinical
director said. About 30 others were injured, five of them
seriously, he added.
	   It was not clear if the other two deaths also were on Faial, the
island hardest hit by the quake.
	   Injured people were being ferried to the hospital by helicopters
because many roads were closed by debris, Camara said.
	   The quake was felt at 5:22 a.m. (0522 GMT) on four of the
islands which lie 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) west of Portugal,
Portuguese state radio RDP reported.
	   Civil Protection Services were also alerted on the islands of
Pico, Sao Jorge and Terceira, where the U.S. Air Force has a base,
RDP said.
	   Gregory Adams, a spokesman at the U.S. Embassy in Lisbon, said
no damage was reported at the air force base.
	   The Azores have a total population of about 250,000, most of
whom make their living from agriculture. The islands have been hit
by earthquakes in the past, with 49 people killed and some 300
injured in one of the worst tremors in 1980.

Militants reject international calls for restraint, observers fan
</HEADLINE>
out to check battle zone &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian militants brushed
aside the latest call to stop their fight for an independent
Kosovo, and international observers fanned out across the province
Thursday for a first-hand look at battle zones.
	   The United States and European countries trying to stop the
fighting in the Serbian province demanded an immediate cease-fire
Wednesday and for the first time called on governments to crack
down on the flow of funds to the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   But the latest cease-fire call, issued by the six-nation Contact
Group in Bonn, Germany, appeared to have little effect on the
militants.
	   In Geneva, Switzerland, the Popular Movement of Kosovo, which
claims to bankroll the KLA, said nothing short of independence
would satisfy the guerrillas.
	   Spokesman Mahmuti Bardhyl said the KLA would agree to a
cease-fire only if the Serbs withdrew all armed units from the
province, where Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
	   That message was repeated by Naim Maloku, a top KLA commander in
western Kosovo. Maloku said in an interview published Thursday by
the Albanian language daily Koha Ditore that Kosovo Albanians had
no choice but to fight for what they consider their rights.
	   ``The war has been imposed on us,'' Maloku said. ``We had no
other way out.''
	   He also rejected calls by the Contact Group _ the United States,
Russia, Britain, France, Germany and Italy _ for the KLA to accept
the leadership of the province's leading non-violent Albanian
politician, Ibrahim Rugova.
	   The Contact Group wants the KLA to allow Rugova to negotiate the
future of the province with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
Kosovo is a province of Serbia, which together with Montenegro
forms Yugoslavia.
	   ``For nine years, Rugova has been calling for dialogue,'' Maloku
saaid. ``We call for dialogue and the Serbs respond with
repression.''
	   As part of the international campaign to curb the crisis,
observers from the United States, Russia, the Netherlands, Belgium
and Britain left Pristina on Thursday for a first-hand look at
areas of recent fighting.
	   The observers -- driving in bullet-proof cars and wearing flack
jackets -- barred reporters from the tour.
	   It was unclear whether the observers would try to visit Morina,
a border town 90 kilometers (56 miles) southwest of here, where
ethnic Albanian sources reported a strong Serb attack Wednesday in
an apparent bid to cut supply lines to Albania.
	   The Albanian Kosovo Information Center said the escalation of
fighting around Morina was accompanied by Serb shelling of at least
four other villages.
	   In neighboring Albania, President Rexhep Mejdani appealed for an
``international presence'' in Kosovo. Mejdani told visiting German
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel that such a presence would reduce
violence and open the way for a diplomatic solution.
	   Kinkel was visiting the Albanian border town of Bajram Curri on
Thursday to meet with Kosovo Albanians who fled there to escape
fighting.
	   In Bonn, the six-nation ``Contact Group'' that coordinates
international policy for the Balkans warned that sanctions could be
applied to militants of the Kosovo Liberation Army if they stand in
the way of a resumption of negotiations.
	   Hundreds have died in the rebellious province since fighting
escalated in late February, and major powers fear a continuation of
violence could disrupt neighboring countries with large Albanian
populations.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak violated a
U.N. air embargo to fly to Libya Thursday for a meeting with Libyan
leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi, Libyan television said.
	   Earlier Egyptian officials said Mubarak traveled in an aircraft
with several ministers and senior aides. The officials spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   Mubarak flew from Cairo to Al-Abrak town, 60 kilometers (37
miles) from Al-Bayda, a northern seaside resort 1,400 kilometers
(865 miles) east of Tripoli, the Libyan capital.
	   ``President Hosni Mubarak arrived aboard an Egyptian plane at
al-Abrak civilian airport,'' a commentator on Libyan television
said in a live broadcast from Al-Abrak where Libyan officials gave
Mubarak a red carpet welcome.

Earthquake strikes Azores Islands, killing five
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with TV reports on homeless; CORRECTS first name of
spokeswoman to Helena &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY HATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ An earthquake jolted Portugal's Azores
Islands in the Atlantic Ocean just before dawn Thursday, causing
houses to collapse and people to flee into the streets. At least
five people were killed, 30 injured and about 1,000 were left
homeless, news reports said.
	   The quake had a magnitude of 5.8 and its epicenter was in the
Atlantic Ocean, 15 kilometers (10 miles) northeast of the island of
Faial, one of the group's nine volcanic islands, a spokesman for
Portugal's National Seismological Institute on the archipelago told
The Associated Press.
	   By midmorning the death toll had reached five, Helena Vaz, a
spokeswoman for the Azores Civil Protection Service, said by phone
from Terceira island.
	   Three people were dead on arrival at the main hospital in Horta,
the capital of Faial, Dr. Jorge Camara, the hospital's clinical
director said. About 30 others were injured, five of them
seriously, he added.
	   It was not clear if the other two deaths also were on Faial, the
island hardest hit by the quake.
	   Injured people were being ferried to the hospital by helicopters
because many roads were closed by debris, Camara said.
	   Footage broadcast on Portuguese state television RTP showed
partially collapsed houses and cars covered in debris in the
village of Ribeirinha on Faial.
	   Families, including small children, were seen standing in the
streets in their nightwear in the bright morning sunshine. The
rural village has about 500 inhabitants.
	   Residents said the quake lasted between 15 and 20 seconds and
was followed by a series of minor aftershocks.
	   Some 1,000 people in the Azores were left homeless, according to
RTP.
	   The quake was felt at 5:22 a.m. (0522 GMT) on four of the
islands which lie 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) west of Portugal,
Portuguese state radio RDP reported.
	   Civil Protection Services were also alerted on the islands of
Pico, Sao Jorge and Terceira, where the U.S. Air Force has a base,
RDP said.
	   Gregory Adams, a spokesman at the U.S. Embassy in Lisbon, said
no damage was reported at the air force base.
	   The Azores have a total population of about 250,000, most of
whom make their living from agriculture. The islands have been hit
by earthquakes in the past, with 49 people killed and some 300
injured in one of the worst tremors in 1980.

	   Mubarak is the most senior world leader to defy the air embargo,
which was imposed in 1992 after Gadhafi refused to hand over two
Libyans suspected in the 1988 bombing of an American airliner over
Lockerbie, Scotland that killed 270 people.
	   From Al-Abrak Mubarak drove to Al-Bayda where he met with
Gadhafi who is recovering from a surgery to repair a hip bone he
broke on Tuesday while exercising.
	   The state Libyan television showed Mubarak shaking hands with
Gadhafi who sat on a wheel chair dressed in a golden brown
traditional Libyan gown. Mubarak also kissed Gadhafi on both cheeks
and inquired about his health.
	   Large crowds of Libyans greeted Mubarak on his arrival at the
Al-Abrak airport, the television said.

 &UR; Palestinian negotiators leave for Washington to meet with Albright &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Palestinian negotiators leaving for
Washington, quotes from Netanyahu, Palestinian Cabinet minister &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian negotiators, who have been summoned
to Washington by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, will
not accept changes in a U.S. proposal for an Israeli troop pullback
in the West Bank, a Palestinian Cabinet minister said Thursday.
	   The negotiators, Nabil Shaath and Saeb Erekat, left for the
United States early Thursday, following a phone call between
Albright and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   ``There are certain issues she (Albright) wants to present to
the Palestinian side,'' said Hanan Ashrawi, Palestinian minister of
higher education.
	   The Palestinian envoys will listen, but ``will not renegotiate
the (U.S.) initiative,'' Ashrawi told a news conference.
	   Israel has demanded that the United States make changes in the
plan which calls for a gradual Israeli pullback from 13 percent of
the West Bank, accompanied by Palestinian security measures.
	   Israel reportedly is ready to hand over 10 percent in full, but
wants to retain control over zoning and planning in the remaining 3
percent.
	   Israel also demands that the Palestinian Authority extradite
suspects in the killings of Israelis and that the Palestine
National Council, rather than the smaller PLO Executive Committee,
annul sections of the PLO Covenant calling for Israel's
destruction.
	   The U.S. initiative does not call for the extradition of wanted
men and is satisfied with a vote on the covenant by the PLO
Executive Committee.
	   Israel radio said Thursday that Washington has agreed only to
cosmetic changes in the original initiative which was accepted by
the Palestinians several weeks ago.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday it was
up to the Palestinians to achieve a breakthrough. The Palestinians
should carry out their commitments, such as confiscating illegal
weapons and reducing the size of their police force, he said.
	   ``We are moving forward in the process, at present mainly in
very intensive contacts with the Americans that have moved the
process forward to no small degree,'' Netanyahu said.
	   The Palestinians have accused Netanyahu of playing for time in
hopes of eventually wriggling out of his commitment to hand over
more land. ``The peace process is not only in a state of deadlock.
We feel that it has been destroyed by Netanyahu,'' Ashrawi said.
	   Ashrawi complained that the United States was not pressing
Israel hard enough. ``We recognize that so far every single
deadline and every single timetable the United States has presented
has been violated by Israel,'' she said.
	   In other developments Thursday, Israeli troops imposed a curfew
on parts of downtown Hebron after shots were fired at a car driven
by Jewish settlers.
	   No one was hurt in the Wednesday night shooting. The settlers
were en route to the Tomb of the Patriarchs, a shrine in downtown
Hebron sacred to Jews and Muslims, when their car came under fire.
	   Bullets struck the car, the army said. Three Palestinians were
detained for questioning, the Voice of Palestine said.
	   Some 450 Jewish settlers and 130,000 Palestinians live in
Hebron. The downtown area is patrolled by Israeli troops while 80
percent of the city are under Palestinian Authority control.
	   In the past week, there have been several clashes between
settlers and Palestinian residents. Last weekend, three Israelis on
horseback smashed the windshields of Arab-owned cars.

Czech leaders sign toleration pact
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be led after Zeman's meeting with the president

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The Social Democrats, who came
first in last month's elections, signed an agreement with a rival
party on Thursday that will allow them to form a minority
government.
	   Later Thursday, Social Democratic leader Milos Zeman is
scheduled to meet President Vaclav Havel who is expected to
designate him as prime minister.
	   ``Today I completed my mission given to me by the president,''
Zeman said after the signing ceremony. ``This afternoon, I will
hand him this agreement as a result of the mission.''
	   Under the agreement, former Premier Vaclav Klaus's Civic
Democratic Party will allow Zeman's Social Democrats to form a
single-party minority Cabinet by not voting against them in
Parliament.
	   In exchange, Klaus' party will be allowed to appoint the
speakers of both chambers of Parliament and the chairmen of key
parliamentary committees.
	   Both parties also agreed not to initiate a non-confidence vote
during the lower chamber's four-year term and not to dissolve the
chamber before the term's end.
	   Each side also promised not to form a coalition or an alliance
with a third party to the detriment of each other's party.
	   The agreement is expected to boost the power of the two largest
political parties, putting pressure on parliament's three smaller
groups - the Christian Democrats, Freedom Union and unreformed
Communists.
	   Both leaders stressed, however, that the agreement is not a
coalition agreement.
	   ``By this agreement, the Civic Democratic Party moves into
opposition,'' Klaus said, adding his party still remains a
``political rival of the Social Democrats.''
	   Zeman's center-left party won 74 of the 200 parliamentary seats
in the June 19-20 elections, Klaus' Civic Democrats finished second
with 63 seats.
	   After coalition talks with two small center-right parties - the
Christian Democrats and the Freedom Union - failed, Zeman settled
on Klaus, his archrival.

Asian markets end mixed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian markets closed mixed Thursday as
investors sought a better grip on the volatile economic and
currency situation in Japan.
	   The Tokyo stock market closed lower as investors fretted over a
lack of details in Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's promise to
make permanent tax cuts next year. A weaker yen may also have
contributed to the fall, analysts said.
	   The Nikkei average of 225 selected issues was down 84.02 points,
or 0.51 percent, at 16,446.95.
	   The dollar was trading at 140.24 yen late Thursday, up 1.20 yen
from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York rate
of 139.27 yen overnight.
	   The stock market was lower throughout the day despite
Hashimoto's promise Wednesday evening that the government will
permanently cut taxes in 1999, which might boost Japan's slumping
consumption.
	   Traders said they wanted more details, such as which taxes would
be cut and by how much.
	   The market needs something ``to get its teeth into,'' said
Stephen Wood, a senior salesman in the foreign institutional sales
department at ING Baring Securities in Tokyo.
	   In Seoul, share prices closed slightly higher on hopes that
recent falling local interest rates would draw investors to the
stock market instead of the bond market.
	   The Composite Index closed at 319.73, up 0.23 points.
	   Analysts said the index gave up much of its gains early Thursday
on uncertainty over which companies will be deemed non-viable by
the government in the near future.
	   The markets were closed in Bangkok for a holiday.
	   Elsewhere:
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices ended moderately higher,
extending their gains to 10 consecutive sessions. The All
Ordinaries Index closed at 2,788.9, up 14.8 points.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand shares closed higher, building on
previous gains. The NZSE-40 capital index closed at 2,095.62, up
6.63 points.
	   TAIPEI: Shares ended at a new six-week high as investors were
encouraged by record June sales by several Taiwan technology
companies and a stronger Nasdaq Composite Index. The Weighted Price
Index was up 10.71 points, or 0.13 percent, closing at 7,947.53,
the highest finish since May 28.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares closed lower, hounded by profit-taking
as the market grappled for a better handle on the developments in
Japan and prospects of higher interest rates. The PSE-30 index was
down 29.10 points, or 1.6 percent, closing at 1,828.40.
	   JAKARTA: Indonesian shares closed lower as investors cashed in
on profits for the second day in a row. The JSX index was down
2.659 points at 470.321.
	   SINGAPORE: Shares closed mostly lower as a Japanese announcement
of permanent tax cuts failed to spur buying interest. The Straits
Times Industrial Index closed 4.13 points lower at 1,103.65.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Shares finished broadly lower on concerns over a
sharp decline in the Malaysian currency. The benchmark Composite
Index, which tracks 100 blue-chip stocks, was down 7.39 points, or
1.62 percent, at 447.89.
	   HONG KONG: Hong Kong stocks closed lower, despite news that the
territory's quasi-central bank had recently repatriated U.S. dlrs 1
billion into the territory's banking system to relieve the tight
liquidity condition. The benchmark Hang Seng Index was down 195.40,
or 2.3 percent, closing at 8,433.78.

	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Croats tried to rationalize their
feelings of despair and disbelief Thursday after their team's
elimination from the final of the World Cup.
	   ``Certainly, we achieved a great success by placing among the
four best in the world in our first try,'' the daily Jutranji list
said. ``Still, we regret missing the chance to play the final.''
	   A day after France's 2-1 victory, Croats in offices, on buses
and in supermarkets continued to analyze the match, trying to
comprehend the defeat.
	   Croatia now meets the Netherlands on Saturday in Paris to decide
the tournament's third and fourth places. Brazil and France clash
for the World Cup on Sunday.
	   Most citizens were thrilled when Croatia, a nation of 4.7
million which gained independence from Yugoslavia seven years ago,
qualified for the World Cup for the first time.
	   Then the team made it to the second round there was euphoria.
Then qualifying for the the quarterfinal was a dream come true.
	   When Croatia crushed powerful Germany 3-0 to reach the
semifinals, everyone was convinced that the team would do the same
to France. Before the match, state television repeatedly aired a
song, with the refrain: ``We don't care for those who mind that
Croatia is in the final.''
	   Reality was all the harder to swallow.
	   Tens of thousands of Croats watched the semifinal contest on
giant TV screens set up in parks and squares across the country.
Hundreds of thousands followed the match in their living rooms,
some with a bottle of champagne chilled for the occasion.
	   Some spent their savings on a last-minute trip to Paris and
tickets to the game.
	   Joyful screams followed Davor Suker's goal that made it 1-0,
just 26 seconds into the second half. The final reality was
sobering.
	   As the referee whistled the end of the match at Stade de France
and screens flashed 2-1 for France, there was a long silence.
	   At one of Zagreb's squares, some sat, bewildered. Some simply
went home. A girl, wearing a T-shirt with captain Zvonimir Boban's
name, sobbed with hands over her face. Two boys cried on each
other's shoulders.
	   Suker felt the urge to tell Croats that the team ``did their
best.''
	   In a live broadcast from Paris on national television, he said:
``It's hard for me to speak to you now. But we must face you when
we lose too.''
	   Still, many were gracious in defeat. A few minutes after the
giant screens went blank, fans by the thousands were dancing,
singing and hugging each other.
	   Judging by the celebrations at the main Zagreb square, it was
hard to tell that Croatia had lost.
	   ``We are not sad, we are happy _ after all, we are among the
four best in the world,'' screamed 18-year-old Janko, wrapped up in
the checkerboard Croatian flag. ``My hat is is off to our team for
getting that far, playing in the semifinals of the World Cup.''

	   Mubarak's visit was not announced and Egypt's official Middle
East News Agency only reported his arrival in Libya at about the
same time Libyan television started its live broadcast.
	   No reason was given for the visit, but Mubarak was believed to
have gone to Libya to wish Gadhafi a speedy recovery after his
surgery.
	   During their meeting, Gadhafi's doctors showed Mubarak three
X-rays of the broken hip.
	   Gadhafi, 56, broke a hip bone while exercising on Monday and he
underwent surgery to repair the hip the same day. He is in good
condition and has resumed normal work on Wednesday, the Libyan
official news agency JANA said.
	   Gadhafi's surgery was broadcast by Libyan television on Tuesday.
	   Mubarak has visited Libya many times since 1992 but has always
driven across the Egyptian-Libyan border.
	   Last month, the Organization of African Unity urged member
states to ignore the sanctions for visits with humanitarian and
religious implications or those relating to official OAU work.
	   But until Thursday's flight by Mubarak, only Chad and Niger had
heeded the call, and Gadhafi twice canceled a visit to Egypt last
month, apparently angered by Egypt's refusal to let him fly to
Cairo.
	   Libya recently launched a campaign to win support from the Arab
League's 22 members to lift the U.N. embargo.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ President B.J. Habibie urged the
ruling party Thursday to break from its authoritarian past, and
said that government policies designed to revive the sluggish
economy had failed to arrest Indonesia's worst crisis in 30 years.
	   In a pessimistic address to a congress of the Golkar party,
Habibie said the yearlong financial crisis that has stripped
millions of people of their jobs shows no signs of abating.
	   ``The policies that have been taken by the government haven't
been able to bring around concrete results,'' he said. ``The rupiah
exchange rate is still low, industry hasn't recovered and
Indonesian financial markets are still lackluster.''
	   Under the tutelage of the International Monetary Fund, Indonesia
has been opening up its economy, dumping monopolies and
restructuring banks, in exchange for billions of dollars in loans.
	   However, protests and riots that led to the ouster of President
Suharto in May stalled the rescue package and scared off investors.
Many fear more social unrest as the economic burden on poor
Indonesians deepens.
	   Habibie has pledged democratic reform in a bid to shed the
autocratic legacy of Suharto, who used Golkar as a vehicle to back
his edicts and steer his largely ceremonial election through a
special assembly for seven, five-year terms.
	   ``Golkar has to take proactive steps toward national reform. And
also Golkar has to reform itself,'' Habibie said.
	   He said the party has to redefine its role and become ``more
responsive to the people's interests and their aspirations.''
	   Party chairman Harmoko also urged hundreds of delegates at a
five-star hotel to make Golkar more democratic.
	   ``It's not a shame to acknowledge the weaknesses and mistakes of
the past. In the era of reform, we have to improve,'' said Harmoko,
who is likely to be replaced during the three-day congress.
	   Outside the hotel, several hundred protesters gathered with
banners to denounce Habibie and declare that Golkar's era was over.
Police and soldiers stood by, but the rally was peaceful.
	   ``Golkar is dead. Why have a congress?'' read one banner.
	   However, a group of 50 others called on Indonesians not to
condemn former President Suharto, who ruled with an iron grip for
32 years.
	   ``Suharto did a great service for the nation,'' said Ismail, a
protest organizer.
	   Other held up placards that read: ``We love Suharto.''
	   The former autocrat has been accused by critics of misusing his
power and amassing a fortune for his family. Suharto has denied any
wrongdoing.
	   Meanwhile, about 100 chanting students protesters gathered
behind the Congress scene, waving a banner that read: ``Suharto to
be put on trial.''
	   ``Suharto and his family had created a massive misery against
the people since they robbed bunches of the nation's rich
resources. So it's fair enough to put him on trial,'' said a
student leader, Herman.
	   Golkar officials are expected to dissolve a leadership council
headed by Suharto, who is still technically the party's chief
patron.
	   Two of his children, eldest daughter Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana and
second son Bambang Trihatmodjo, hold leadership roles in the party.
	   Habibie has announced that he will hold general elections next
year, which could threaten Golkar's majority in the 500-seat
Parliament for the first time in decades.

	   Here is a summary of late news from The Associated Press.
Stories carried ``i'' or ``f'' category codes. Some of the items
below have moved on this circuit in expanded form:
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Police blocking Protestant
marchers at a rural church fired plastic bullets Thursday morning
to repel protesters who briefly broke through a security line. No
injuries were reported. The clash came hours before leaders of the
Orange Order met British Prime Minister Tony Blair in London in
hopes of winning permission for a contentious march to go through a
hostile Catholic neighborhood. Blair has said he will not reverse a
decision by Northern Ireland's Parades Commission barring the
Orangemen from marching on the Garvaghy Road in Portadown, where
Catholic residents say the Protestant marchers are not welcome. The
Garvaghy Road march has sparked violent clashes the past three
summers. (NORTHERN IRELAND)
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ An earthquake jolted Portugal's Azores
Islands in the Atlantic Ocean just before dawn Thursday, causing
houses to collapse and people to flee into the streets. At least
five people were killed, 30 injured and about 1,000 were left
homeless, news reports said. The quake had a magnitude of 5.8 and
its epicenter was in the Atlantic Ocean, 15 kilometers (10 miles)
northeast of the island of Faial, one of the group's nine volcanic
islands, a spokesman for Portugal's National Seismological
Institute on the archipelago told The Associated Press. By
midmorning the death toll had reached five, Helena Vaz, a
spokeswoman for the Azores Civil Protection Service, said by phone
from Terceira island. (AZORES-QUAKE)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Opening a ruling party congress,
President B.J. Habibie said Thursday that government policies
designed to revive the sluggish economy had failed to yield gains.
In a pessimistic address to Golkar Party delegates, Habibie said
the yearlong financial crisis that has stripped millions of people
of their jobs shows no signs of abating. ``The policies that have
been taken by the government haven't been able to bring around
concrete results,'' he said. ``The rupiah exchange rate is still

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian negotiators, who have been summoned
to Washington by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, will
not accept changes in a U.S. proposal for an Israeli troop pullback
in the West Bank, a Palestinian Cabinet minister said Thursday. The
negotiators, Nabil Shaath and Saeb Erekat, left for the United
States early Thursday, following a phone call between Albright and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. The Palestinian envoys will
listen, but ``will not renegotiate the (U.S.) initiative,'' said
Hanan Ashrawi, Palestinian minister of higher education, said at a
news conference. Israel has demanded that the United States make
changes in the plan which calls for a gradual Israeli pullback from
13 percent of the West Bank, accompanied by Palestinian security
measures. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Indian business leaders on Thursday
welcomed a proposal by U.S. senators to exempt American farm
exports from the sanctions imposed after India and Pakistan
conducted nuclear tests. In Washington, a special Senate panel
reviewing the U.S. economic sanctions against India and Pakistan
pressed Wednesday to lift trade restrictions on farm products.
Senators Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, and Joe Biden, a
Delaware Democrat, said they would introduce legislation to allow
President Bill Clinton to waive some of the sanctions imposed
against India and Pakistan after they tested nuclear devices two
months ago. The amendments would exempt financing of agricultural
exports from the ban on loans and aid to the two countries. The
sanctions Clinton imposed were virtually automatic under a 1994 law
and can only be lifted or amended by Congress.(INDIA-US-SANCTIONS)

	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Black smoke billowed up over a large
market in central Lagos on Thursday from a blaze police say was set
by youths enraged at the death of the country's leading political
prisoner.
	   Although parts of Lagos were calm after two tumultuous days, the
fire at the Agege Market warned that life in Nigeria was far from
returning to normal.
	   Police and firefighters battled the blaze that started
mid-morning in several market stalls. Several houses were
reportedly also set alight by marauding groups of youths.
	   The arson is the latest fallout after shock at the death of
Moshood Abiola turned to rage and boiled over into deadly rioting
on Wednesday.
	   Abiola, the country's top political prisoner and the man many
hoped would become Nigeria's next civilian president, died Tuesday
while still imprisoned by the ruling military junta.
	   In response, rioters tore through parts of the commercial
capital of Lagos, the southern university town of Ibadan and
Abiola's hometown of Abeokuta. At least 19 people were killed in
the Wednesday violence.
	   Police used tear gas to quell the violence that began to ebb
Wednesday evening.
	   Many people in Lagos stayed home. The smoldering ruins of the
mayhem, piles of burning tires, were left along street corners.

World Cup: tournament security described as success despite fan
</HEADLINE>
violence &QL; 
 &UR; By LARRY SIDDONS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Security at the World Cup has been a success
despite street violence that left a police officer in a coma and
ravaged an historic section of France's third-largest city,
officials in charge of order keeping said Thursday.
	   Dominique Spinosi, head of security for the French organizing
committee, and Horst Schmidt, her counterpart with FIFA, said there
had been no trouble in stadiums and that violence in World Cup
cities had been limited to two main confrontations.
	   They said years of planning and coordination with police and
other government agencies in a dlrs 20 million security program
involving 6,000 workers had assured a safe environment for the more
than 2.5 million fans who peacefully attended the matches.
	   ``We know it was a success, even though we acknowledge there
have been incidents,'' Schmidt said.
	   Spinosi said organizers had aimed their security plans at ``the
99 percent of the people we knew would come to party, and react
quickly to the 1 percent who would act up.''
	   ``We tried to adapt and adjust our security setup,'' she said.
``If we had decided we were going to turn our French cities into
bunkers, we would have failed in our task. We have seen that
football is an enormous festival. We didn't want to spoil the
fun.''
	   With the Cup returning to Europe after a relatively crime-free
stop in the United States four years ago, authorities knew they
would have to deal with violence by fans, especially followers of
England and Germany.
	   Soon after the tournament started June 10, trouble hit. English
fans rampaged through the Old Port section of Marseille for three
nights, fighting rival fans, local youths and police. Shops and
restaurants were trashed, dozens hurt and hundreds arrested.
	   At the other end of the country, the small city Lens was invaded
the day of the Germany-Yugoslavia match by neo-Nazi groups from
just across the border. Daniel Nivel, a 44-year-old police officer
and father of two children, was beaten into a coma by a German thug
wielding an iron bar.
	   Officials said that Nivel remained in a coma Thursday while
``continuing day to day to show slight improvement in his
condition.''
	   Three Germans have been arrested in connection with that crime,
the worst violence associated with the World Cup since 250 fans
were arrested in fighting in Rimini, Italy, in 1990.
	   Schmidt and Spinosi repeated the position taken by other
tournament officials that they could do only so much to secure
areas away from the stadiums. They also said that government
authorities in Europe were hamstrung by recent laws opening borders
of European Union countries from passport controls.
	   The problems in Marseille and Lens were two sides of the
violence picture, the security officials said. In Marseille, fans
who drank all day and were frustrated by lack of tickets ran riot.
In Lens, about 450 known neo-fascists from 30 German cities ``came
to pick a fight with police,'' Spinosi said.
	   Nivel, she said, had been caught off-guard away from the main
police force.
	   ``Otherwise, the situation in Lens was under control,'' she
said.

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ An earthquake shook Portugal's Azores
Islands in the Atlantic Ocean just before dawn Thursday, killing at
least five people and leaving some 1,000 people homeless.
	   The quake's magnitude was 5.8 and had its epicenter at sea, 15
kilometers (10 miles) northeast of Faial island, one of the group's
nine volcanic islands, a spokesman for Portugal's National
Seismological Institute said.
	   By midday the death toll stood at five, according to Helena Vaz,
spokeswoman for the Azores Civil Protection Service.
	   Vaz said at least 40 people were injured and some 1,000 were
left homeless on Faial, an island with a population of about 5,000
and the one said to be hardest hit by the quake.
	   It was not immediately possible to ascertain the affects of the
quake on the other islands.
	   Two Portuguese Air Force Puma helicopters were being used to
take casualties to the hospital in Horta, Faial's main city.
	   An Air Force C-130 transport plane carrying emergency aid was
due to leave Lisbon at 1 p.m. (1200 GMT) for the three-hour flight
to the archipelago.
	   The plane was taking sniffer dogs, medical teams, electricity
generators, rescue experts, 2,000 blankets and 160 army tents with
capacity for about 1,000 people, Antonio Capinha, a spokesman for
the Internal Affairs Ministry said.
	   ``What they need mainly at the moment is sniffer dogs to find
people who may be buried in the rubble of their own homes,'' said
Capinha.
	   Prime Minister Antonio Guterres canceled a weekend vacation with
Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar to fly to the Azores.
	   Portuguese state television RTP showed images in the small Faial
village of Ribeirinha with families standing about in their
nightwear in the bright morning sunshine as they surveyed the
damage done to their houses and cars.
	   Residents said the quake lasted between 15 and 20 seconds and
was followed by a series of minor aftershocks.
	   The quake was felt at 5:22 a.m. (0522 GMT) on four of the
islands which lie 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) west of Portugal,
Portuguese state radio RDP reported.
	   Besides Faial, Civil Protection Services were also alerted on
the islands of Pico, Sao Jorge and Terceira, where the U.S. Air
Force has a base, RDP said.
	   Gregory Adams, a spokesman at the U.S. Embassy in Lisbon, said
there was no damage reported at the base.
	   The Azores have a total population of about 250,000, most of
whom make their living from agriculture. The islands have been hit
by earthquakes in the past, with 49 people killed and some 300
injured in one of the worst tremors in 1980.

Official: Brunei can withstand Amedeo losses
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei (AP) _ Oil-rich Brunei can withstand
the fallout of the collapse of its largest private company, owned
by the sultan's brother, a senior Finance Ministry official said
Thursday.
	   ``Brunei's economy is in good hands and there is no need for any
undue fears,'' said the official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   It was the first comment from Brunei since the London-based
Sunday Telegraph reported that Amedeo, the investment and
construction group run by Prince Jefri Bolkiah, faces losses of
about dlrs 16 billion.
	   The newspaper reported that Amedeo had collapsed under the
weight of the losses and its managers were being sought for
questioning. It said the government had hired independent auditors
to examine the company's books.
	   Weighed down by the report, the Singapore dollar, to which the
Brunei currency is pegged, sank against the U.S. dollar on Monday.
The U.S. dollar was quoted at 1.71 Singapore dollars Monday
compared to 1.69 last Friday.
	   Late Thursday, the U.S. dollar was trading at 1.7162 Singapore
dollars. Traders cited the lingering effect of Amedeo's reported
troubles, as well as Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong's warning Tuesday
that Singapore may sink into recession next year.
	   Troubles at Amedeo were going to affect Brunei's economic
health, the official said. ``But at this moment we just don't know
the extent of the repercussions.''
	   He denied that the Amedeo losses had dented Brunei's national
reserves. Brunei's reserves were ``large enough to stop you from
worrying,'' the official told a reporter.
	   Last week, the Borneo Bulletin, the only English-language
newspaper in Brunei, reported that Amedeo was ``troubled'' and
quoted Development Minister Haji Ismail as saying: ``I wish I knew
what was going wrong. I do not know what went wrong.''
	   But the local daily has not reported on Amedeo this week.
	   Among Amedeo projects are the six-star Jerudong Park House hotel
and power-generation projects in partnership with Germany's Siemens
AG, the Bulletin said.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A bridegroom was so drunk just minutes
before his wedding that his wife-to-be called in the police and
then promptly married someone else, an Indian newspaper reported
Thursday.
	   Officers hustled the groom, who had been shouting drunken
insults at the wedding party, to the police station in Hapur, near
New Delhi, The Hindustan Times newspaper reported.
	   After the bride and her parents called off the wedding, a
neighbor gallantly proposed to the woman and she readily agreed,
the paper reported. That union took place the same night.
	   The drunken man was later released and returned home.

Sony's ad company buys 10 years copyright after poetical goof
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ An advertising agency has agreed to
buy a 10-year copyright from a favorite poet of the late dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu who claimed the firm used his poem without
permission to promote Sony mobile phones, an executive said
Thursday.
	   The agreement with poet Adrian Paunescu was signed Wednesday for
an undisclosed amount, according to Adrian Nicolae, Romanian
representative of the DDB advertising company.
	   Paunescu filed a lawsuit this year against DBB, claiming the
firm had used his 1981 poem ``The Wheel'' to promote a Sony mobile
phones here.
	   Paunescu could not be reached for comment Thursday. But he was
quoted by the newspaper National as saying he was pleased with the
agreement.
	   During the Ceausescu regime, Paunescu wrote a series of poems
praising the Communist ruler as the ``Genius of the Carpathians.''
He was allowed to hold huge outdoor festivals with folk music and
poems and became a cult figure.
	   After Ceausescu was overthrown and executed in 1989, Paunescu
headed the Socialist Workers' Party, which is now out of
parliament. He was a great friend of the late Nicu Ceausescu, the
playboy son of the late president.

Mubarak defies U.N. embargo to fly to Libya
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES urgent series; RECASTS lede; CORRECTS that Gadhafi
broke hip bone on Monday sted Tuesday &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak flew to
Libya Thursday to meet with Col. Moammar Gadhafi, Libyan television
said. The flight violated a U.N. air embargo.
	   Earlier, Egyptian officials said Mubarak traveled in an aircraft
with several ministers and senior aides. The officials spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   Mubarak is the most senior world leader to defy the air embargo,
which was imposed in 1992 after Gadhafi refused to hand over two
Libyans suspected in the 1988 bombing of an American airliner over
Lockerbie, Scotland that killed 270 people.
	   Mubarak flew from Cairo to Al-Abrak town, 60 kilometers (37
miles) from the northern seaside town of Al-Bayda, the television
said.
	   ``President Hosni Mubarak arrived aboard an Egyptian plane at
Al-Abrak civilian airport,'' a commentator on Libyan television
said in a live broadcast from Al-Abrak where Libyan officials gave
Mubarak a red carpet welcome.
	   Mubarak's visit was not announced and Egypt's official Middle
East News Agency only reported his arrival in Libya at about the
same time Libyan television started its live broadcast.
	   The broadcast was monitored in Cairo.
	   From Al-Abrak, Mubarak drove to Al-Bayda where he met with
Gadhafi who is recovering from a surgery to repair a hip bone he
broke on Monday while exercising. Al-Bayda is 1,400 kilometers (865
miles) east of Tripoli, the Libyan capital.
	   The state Libyan television showed Mubarak shaking hands with
Gadhafi who sat on a wheel chair dressed in a golden brown
traditional Libyan gown. Mubarak also kissed Gadhafi on both cheeks
and inquired about his health.
	   Large crowds of Libyans greeted Mubarak on his arrival at the
Al-Abrak airport, the television said.
	   No reason was given for the visit, but Mubarak was believed to
have gone to Libya to wish Gadhafi a speedy recovery after his
surgery.
	   During their meeting, Gadhafi's doctors showed Mubarak three
X-rays of the broken hip.
	   Since the surgery on Monday, Gadhafi, 56, is reported to be in
good condition and resumed normal work on Wednesday, the Libyan
official news agency JANA said. Gadhafi's surgery was broadcast by
Libyan television on Tuesday.
	   Mubarak has visited Libya many times since 1992 but has always
driven across the Egyptian-Libyan border.
	   Last month, the Organization of African Unity urged member
states to ignore the sanctions for visits with humanitarian and
religious implications or those relating to official OAU work.
	   But until Thursday's flight by Mubarak, only Chad and Niger had
heeded the call, and Gadhafi twice canceled a visit to Egypt last
month, apparently angered by Egypt's refusal to let him fly to
Cairo.
	   Libya recently launched a campaign to win wider support from the
22-nation Arab League to lift the U.N. embargo. In September 1997,
the League had urged member states to ``take steps to ease the
toughness of the sanctions.''

<TEXT>
	   SALONICA, Greece (AP) _ A strike to protest proposals to reform
the debt-troubled state railroad stopped all train traffic Thursday
around this northern port.
	   Trains from Athens stopped about 100 kilometers (60 miles) from
Salonica, forcing passengers to continue by bus. The strike was
limited to the Salonica area and did not disrupt rail traffic in
other parts of Greece.
	   Employees of the state railroad have been staging strikes
throughout Greece since the spring to protest changes in working
hours and government plans to privatize the railroad.
	   The union of rail workers said it would continue staging strikes
unless the government backed off its plans for the rail company.

World Cup: French to appeal suspension
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ There's an outside chance that Laurent Blanc may
play in the World Cup final after all.
	   Although they're not optimistic, French team officials planned
to appeal the automatic suspension the central defender was
expected to receive later Thursday after his expulsion in the
semifinal victory over Croatia.
	   The Olympic Marseille star, who has played 73 times for France,
was sent off for the first time in his long career for pushing
Croatian defender Slaven Bilic in the face Wednesday as the two
prepared to chase a free kick.
	   FIFA regards that as violent conduct and has suspended other
players, such as Dutch striker Patrick Kluivert and Argentina's
Ariel Ortega, for more than one game for similar conduct. Any
suspension means Blanc misses Sunday's final against four-time and
defending titlist Brazil at the Stade de France.
	   ``It was unjust, it was too harsh of the referee,'' French coach
Aime Jacquet said of the expulsion.
	   ``We will appeal but we fear it will be a formality. We always
have hope but I don't want to give Blanc any false hope.''
	   Blanc, scorer of the extra time ``Golden Goal'' against Paraguay
that put the French into the quarterfinal, said he wasn't confident
either an a suspension can be avoided.
	   ``It would be a great surprise,'' he said. ``It would be
unique.''
	   But he's still upset.
	   ``My expulsion punishes the player but the really bad scenario
is that it also punishes the team. I have this feeling of having
tasted the cake, but now I'm not allowed to touch the cherry,''
said Blanc.
	   Bilic said that Blanc's red card was all his own fault.
	   ``I didn't get him sent off, he did,'' the Everton defender
said.
	   ``He touched me, technically that's an offense, and the referee
saw it.
	   ``I'm not happy that he's going to miss the final, but if you do
something like that you're going to get punished. That's all there
is to say about it.''

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Leaders of Northern Ireland's
Orange Order on Thursday appealed for calm after Prime Minister
Tony Blair refused to reverse a ban on their Protestant march going
through a hostile Catholic neighborhood.
	   ``We are greatly concerned about the situation in our
province,'' said the Rev. William Bingham, a member of a four-man
Orange Order delegation who met Blair in the prime minister's
Downing Street office in London.
	   Neither side budged. ``We are intending to keep the channels of
communication open over the next few days,'' said Bingham.
	   Earlier Thursday, police blocking the Protestant marchers at a
rural church field fired plastic bullets to repeal protesters who
briefly broke through a security line. No injuries were reported in
the clash.
	   Violence has erupted in the province since Sunday when police
and British troops, enforcing a decision by Northern Ireland's
Parades Commission, barred the Orangemen from marching on the
Garvaghy Road in Portadown, where Catholic residents say the
Protestant marchers are not welcome. The Garvaghy Road march has
sparked violent clashes the past three summers.
	   In London, a spokesman for Blair said the meeting was friendly,
but acknowledged the situation was very difficult.
	   Blair, said the spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity,
is ``not in a position to reverse the decision of the Parades
Commission.
	   The Orange Order leaders, upset at clashes between protesters
and the mainly Protestant police force, appealed for calm and
accused unidentified groups of orchestrating violence to undermine
their position.
	   Underlining the impasse, David McNarry, an organizer of the
Orange Order standoff in Portadown, warned that ``we can, if we
wish, put our minds to paralyze this country in a matters of
hours.''

More Myanmar opposition figures detained
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The military government in neighboring
Myanmar has arrested 11 more leading opposition figures in a
growing crackdown on Aung San Suu Kyi's pro-democracy movement, an
exiled opposition group said Thursday.
	   The reported arrests follow a harshly worded government
statement accusing Suu Kyi, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in
1991, of trying to plunge the country into violence and suggesting
legal steps would be justified to stop her.
	   It accused Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy of ``putting
on war-paint and deliberately trying to create a head-on collision
and confrontation with the government.''
	   The threats came after Suu Kyi flouted an unofficial ban on
traveling outside the capital and staged a 24-hour standoff with
police on a road north of Yangon, a symbolic challenge to the
authorities amid a wider campaign to hasten civilian rule.
	   The All Burma Students' Democratic Front, a Thailand-based
opposition group of students who fled a bloody crackdown against an
anti-government uprising in 1988, said Thursday the government was
stepping up arrests.
	   The targets are winners of parliamentary elections the military
allowed in 1990. The vote was overwhelmingly won by the NLD and the
military never allowed the legislature to convene. The country has
been in political deadlock since.
	   In May, Suu Kyi's embattled party for the first time set a
deadline, Aug. 21, for the government to convene the parliament.
The date will fall amid the anniversary period of the uprising 10
years ago.
	   The government has responded by ordering all of the elected
members not already in jail or exile to report twice a day to local
authorities, apparently to stop them convening on their own.
	   The ABSDF said Thursday that 11 new members have recently been
detained for violating the restrictions, bringing the total to more
than 50. Two have been sent to a prison labor camp, the ABSDF said.
	   Among the 11 was Hla Hla Moe, a member whom Suu Kyi traveled out
of Yangon on Tuesday to see.
	   Suu Kyi was stopped 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of the
capital and sat in her car _ along with NLD Chairman Aung Shwe,
another party official and the driver _ for nearly 24 hours until
Hla Hla Moe was brought to meet her.
	   The military has ruled Myanmar, also known as Burma, since 1962.
Suu Kyi, daughter of independence hero Aung San, was vaulted to the
leadership of the pro-democracy forces in 1988 and has spent most
of the past decade under house arrest or tight restriction.
	   Since the NLD's recent deadline was issued, the government has
stepped up its rhetoric and said the country could be plunged into
chaos. But the security forces control most aspects of life and any
sign of dissent is usually stamped out.
	   ``The NLD has clearly decided to take a hellish line of action
for reasons of party politics'' to create ``instability and
chaos,'' the statement said.
	   ``The government has practiced maximum restraint in solving the
problem but deliberate creation of confrontation by the NLD to
force the government to violently react needs to be examined,'' it
said.

	   ROME (AP) _ A U.S. delegation on Thursday pledged to help
rebuild the region in the Italian alps where an American jet sliced
a cable car line, sending 20 people plunging to their death.
	   During a visit of Cavalese, site of the accident, the group told
regional officials they hoped to hand them a dlrs 20 million check
within 90 days. The funds, which must still be approved by the
Senate, are to reconstruct the gondola and help boost tourism in
the area.
	   The delegation, which includes the Chairman of the
Appropriations Subcommittee on National Security, Bill Young,
toured the area to determine how best to revive the region's
tourism-based economy, which nosedived following the accident.
	   ``I hope that today we can alleviate the difficulties of this
town,'' said U.S. Ambassador to Italy, Thomas Foglietta, who
accompanied the group.
	   Evidence showed the Marine Corps EA-6B Prowler, on a low-level
training mission, was flying too fast and too low when it struck
the cable at the Cermis ski area Feb. 3.
	   Following investigative hearings in Camp Lejeune, N.C., a
military judge recommended courts-martial for the jet's pilot and
navigator on charges including involuntary manslaughter. The judge
asked that charges against two backseat crewmen be dropped.

Hyundai officials to visit North Korea again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea on Thursday allowed
officials of Hyundai Business Group to freely visit North Korea to
discuss unprecedented sightseeing tours to the communist state by
South Koreans.
	   Hyundai was the first South Korean conglomerate given such a
permit under the government of President Kim Dae-jung. Kim has said
he will ease travel and investment restrictions against the North
in efforts to pry open its isolated society.
	   By law, South Koreans are barred from visiting the North without
government approval. And Kim's predecessors had rarely given such
permission.
	   On Thursday, Hyundai said it would send a 33-member delegation
to the North later this month to discuss details of a sightseeing
project agreed upon when its chairman, Chung Ju-yung, visited his
native North Korea in June.
	   Chung hopes to send 1,000 South Korean and foreign tourists
daily to Diamond Mountain, a major tourist site on the North's east
coast. The first cruise liner will sail for the North as early as
September, Hyundai said.
	   In North Korea, Hyundai officials will discuss other joint
venture proposals as well.
	   For one, Hyundai hopes to relocate some of its surplus
facilities to assemble subcompact cars in the North, capitalizing
on cheap labor costs there, about one-eighth of those in South
Korea.
	   On his June visit, Chung donated 500 cattle as a gift to the
North. He plans to send another 500 head.
	   Hyundai's North Korea projects were briefly thrown into doubt
when a small North Korean submarine was captured off South Korea's
east coast on June 22, tangled in a fishing net. Its nine occupants
were later found dead in an apparent murder-suicide.
	   South Korea later said the sub's intrusion would not affect its
new policy of engaging the North, rather than isolating it.
	   The two Koreas are still technically at war after their
three-year war ended without a peace treaty in 1953. Their border
is sealed, with nearly 2 million troops deployed on the two sides.

	   A summary of late financial and business news from The
Associated Press. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian markets closed mixed Thursday as
investors sought a better grip on the volatile economic and
currency situation in Japan. The Tokyo stock market closed lower as
investors fretted over a lack of details in Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto's promise to make permanent tax cuts next year. A weaker
yen may also have contributed to the fall, analysts said. The
Nikkei average of 225 selected issues was down 84.02 points, or
0.51 percent, at 16,446.95. The dollar was trading at 140.24 yen
late Thursday, up 1.20 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also
above its late New York rate of 139.27 yen overnight. The stock
market was lower throughout the day despite Hashimoto's promise
Wednesday evening that the government will permanently cut taxes in
1999, which might boost Japan's slumping
consumption.(ASIAN-MARKETS)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ President B.J. Habibie urged the
ruling party Thursday to break from its authoritarian past, and
said that government policies designed to revive the sluggish
economy had failed to arrest Indonesia's worst crisis in 30 years.
In a pessimistic address to a congress of the Golkar party, Habibie
said the yearlong financial crisis that has stripped millions of
people of their jobs shows no signs of abating. ``The policies that
have been taken by the government haven't been able to bring around
concrete results,'' he said. ``The rupiah exchange rate is still
low, industry hasn't recovered and Indonesian financial markets are
still lackluster.'' (INDONESIA-PARTY CONGRESS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's lead negotiator held a key round of talks
Thursday with international lenders in an effort to secure a huge
loan that could help stabilize the country's battered markets.
Russia wants dlrs 10 billion to 15 billion in new loans to restore
confidence in financial markets that have been in a tailspin for
months. Anatoly Chubais, Russia's representative in the talks, met
Thursday with officials from both the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund and said the negotiations were in a
``decisive'' stage. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singaporeans who have lost jobs in the economic
downturn should take any available job before things get worse, a
Singapore union leader said Thursday. Seng Harn Thong of the
National Trade Union Congress urged retrenched workers to take any
job they can and then switch to better jobs when the economy
recovers, Singapore TV reported. But he added that the worst is yet
to come. Though the unemployment rate in this island-republic of
3.1 million is still low at 2.2 percent, the number of job openings
has dropped by 44 percent as compared to last
year.(SINGAPORE-ECONOMY)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Police in Tokyo arrested a former bank employee and
an importer Thursday for allegedly obtaining 108 million yen (dlrs
776,000) through illegal use of an on-line system. Arrested were
Yuji Nishida, 43, a former deputy manger of Midori Bank's Tokyo
branch, and Saburo Uehara, 46, president of a clothing import firm,
a spokesman for the Tokyo Metropolitan Police said. The spokesman,
on condition of anonymity, said that Nishida illegally manipulated
Midori Bank's on-line computer system to transfer money into an
account held by Uehara's firm on four occasions between July and
September of last year. (JAPAN-FRAUD)

Indonesia waiting for Lisbon's response on new Timor proposal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia is waiting for a response
from Lisbon on the proposed special status for the former
Portuguese colony of East Timor, Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said
Thursday.
	   Jakarta has offered to grant special status to East Timor and to
release a jailed guerrilla commander in return for international
recognition of Indonesia's sovereignty over the territory it
annexed 23 years ago.
	   Speaking to reporters after attending a parliament session,
Alatas said the response would be conveyed by U.N. envoy Jamshed
Marker, who is expected to arrive in Jakarta next week.
	   ``I do not want to speculate, but I can conclude from news
reports that Portugal's attitude about the Indonesia proposal is
not negative,'' Alatas said. ``We have to wait for a detailed
explanation from envoy Jamshed Marker.''
	   During the visit, Marker, who has been chairing U.N.-sponsored
talks between Indonesia and Portugal, is also scheduled to visit
East Timor.
	   It will be his second visit to the troubled territory since
March 1997, when troops shot two pro-independence demonstrators to
death and 38 others were wounded when they tried to see him at his
hotel.
	   Indonesia invaded the half-island East Timor in 1975 and annexed
it 1976. Since then, a small band of rebels has been fighting for
independence, while Indonesian soldiers are frequently accused of
human rights abuses.
	   Alatas had denied reports from Lisbon that Jakarta was planning
a release in the coming days of Jose Alexandre ``Xanana'' Gusmao, a
guerrilla leader now serving a 20-year prison term.
	   Alatas said the release of Gusmao, who has been in a Jakarta
prison since 1992, would be carried out only as a part of a global
solution on the future of East Timor.

Russia seeks new loan from international lenders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW grafs 3-4 with Yeltsin saying that ruble will not be
devalued. Minor editing to trim.
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's lead negotiator held a key round of talks
Thursday with international lenders in an effort to secure a huge
loan that could help stabilize the country's battered markets.
	   Russia says it needs dlrs 10 billion to 15 billion in new loans
to restore confidence in financial markets that have been in a
tailspin for months.
	   In another development, President Boris Yeltsin said his
government remained committed to defending the currency, which has
come under pressure during the current crisis. A falling ruble
would lead to increased prices, something the government wants
desperately to avoid.
	   ``We will firmly keep the ruble from devaluation,'' Yeltsin told
reporters in the Kremlin.
	   Anatoly Chubais, Russia's representative in the loan talks, met
Thursday with officials from both the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund and said the negotiations were in a
``decisive'' stage.
	   The parties have agreed on the broad outline of a bailout
package, Chubais said following talks Tuesday. But the IMF and the
World Bank may be reluctant to finalize any loan deal until
Russia's parliament approves an economic stabilization package
proposed by President Boris Yeltsin's administration.
	   Parliament's lower house is not scheduled to meet again until
July 15, and the Communists and other opposition members have
strong reservations about measures that would raise taxes.
	   Russia's government has chronic problems in collecting taxes,
and the IMF has withheld money on an existing loan several times
because the government hasn't been able to raise sufficient
revenues.
	   The government would like the loan as soon as possible to deal
with a wide range of problems. Millions of workers have to wait
months for their salaries. Labor unrest is on the rise. The Russian
stock market has fallen by more than half so far this year, and
foreign investors are fleeing in droves.
	   Thursday's talks focused on a structural adjustment loan from
the World Bank that would give the Russian government dlrs 600
million to dlrs 800 million in budget support, officials said.
	   Chubais also plans to hold talks with the International Monetary
Fund on Friday. An IMF mission is in Moscow for a second week, and
its representatives were also present for Thursday's session.
	   So far, the current crisis has been restricted largely to the
stock and bond markets. But all Russians would feel the pinch if
the currency is devalued and price rise.
	   Before the crisis, the government had been predicting economic
growth of about 2 percent this year. That would have been Russia's
strongest showing this decade. But now the economy is flat, and may
even contract this year, according to most forecasts.

Hallmark Cards buys out British competitor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Maybe investors should mail a thank-you note to
Hallmark Cards, which agreed Thursday to snap up British rival
Creative Publishing PLC for 188 million pounds (dlrs 306 million)
in cash.
	   The deal will create Britain's biggest greeting card group, with
a market share approaching 30 percent. The announcement sent
Creative Publishing shares soaring on the London Stock Exchange.
	   Hallmark bid 233 pence (dlrs 3.80) per share, or 37 percent more
than Creative Publishing's closing price on Wednesday. By midday,
Creative Publishing had jumped to 230 pence (dlrs 3.75) per share.
	   Executives called their companies a perfect fit and said no
layoffs are planned.
	   Hallmark is a leader at the high end of Britain's greeting card
business, selling fancy cards at premium prices. Creative
Publishing is the market leader of boxed cards, such as Christmas
greetings sold in bulk for much cheaper prices per card.
	   Hallmark will also get Creative Publishing's manufacturing plant
at its home base of Bradford, England. Hallmark's British
subsidiary has previously hired outside contractors to make cards
for the British market.
	   The companies said they anticipated no regulatory problems with
the merger, because there is little overlap in their businesses and
the British greeting card industry will remain highly competitive.
	   Hallmark Cards Inc., the world's largest manufacturer of
greeting cards, is privately held and based in Kansas City,
Missouri.

Report: Bangkok road in dark because power cables stolen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A major road in downtown Bangkok has
been without lighting for 10 months because thieves stole about 8
kilometers (5 miles) of electrical cables, a newspaper reported
Thursday.
	   Residents of the area say the lack of lighting is a safety
hazard because it encourages illegal traffic maneuvers and makes
oncoming vehicles difficult to see, the Bangkok Post reported.
	   A traffic police officer, Lt. Seksan Srinarong, said food shops
and gas stations provide sufficient lighting along the
4.25-kilometer (2.6-mile), six-lane route, the newspaper reported.
	   ``As far as I can recall, the road is never completely blacked
out,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   Another traffic policeman said the lack of lighting might be
dangerous, but traffic was usually light and there had been no
accidents reported.
	   The power line cables were apparently stolen last September, but
the theft was discovered only two months later, an employee of the
construction company for the road was quoted as saying.
	   He said that before the theft, power had probably been
temporarily cut off to the cables _ which lie in a ditch parallel
to the road _ to avoid accidents at other construction projects.
	   ``But later local people or construction workers might have
stolen them because copper wire fetches high prices,'' he said.
	   The Post said the city's Public Works Department had asked for a
2 million baht (dlrs 48,780) budget for new cables, while the city
had requested the Metropolitan Electricity Authority to install
temporary cables by Aug. 12.

Katayama leads in Yonex Open Hiroshima
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HIROSHIMA, Japan (AP) _ Shingo Katayama shot a 6-under-par 66
Thursday and took a one-stroke lead in the opening round of the 100
million yen (dlrs 714,300) Yonex Open Hiroshima.
	   Katayama, who has yet to win in two years as a pro, had a round
of seven birdies and one bogey over the 6,950-yard (6,325-meter),
par-72 Hiroshima Country Club course.
	   Tied for second at 67 were Toru Suzuki, winner of the Sapporo
Tokyu last month, Takao Nogami, Akihito Yokoyama and Satoshi Ogawa.
	   Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki, seeking his first victory of the season
and 107th overall, shot a 68 and was tied for sixth with Kaname
Yokoo, Dinesh Chand of Fiji and Go Higaki.
	   Hajime Meshiai and Australian Peter McWhinney were in a group of
eight sharing 10th at 69.

Suspect in Briton killing sentenced to death in separate case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Two men charged with killing a British
tourist have been found guilty by a court of killing another man
and sentenced to death, newspaper reports said Thursday.
	   The Kenyan defendants have been standing trial simultaneously on
separate homicide charges, one for killing a Kenyan teacher in
January and the second for the stabbing death of British tourist
Roy Chivers on Feb. 15.
	   The Chivers trial is scheduled to resume July 16.
	   On Wednesday a magistrate in Nyeri in central Kenya sentenced
Peter Hiuhu Gachau and Simon Njoroge Wairimu to death by hanging
for the Jan. 13 murder of the teacher. They were found guilty on
July 3.
	   The two were convicted of murdering Charles Mwariri Wachira and
stealing his boots, jacket and cash in Nyeri, about 120 kilometers
north of Nairobi.
	   Gacheru and Wairimu are also standing trial in the same Nyeri
magistrate's court for the murder of Chivers at the Aberdare
Country Club, while he was strolling with his wife 130 kilometers
(80 miles) from Nairobi .
	   Chivers, 50, of Orpington, Kent, was stabbed in the chest and
died while being flown to hospital in Nairobi. His wife Sandra
Christine Chivers suffered cuts on her fingers.
	   Mrs. Chivers was the first witness to take the stand when the
trial opened May 7. She testified that her husband's assailants
tackled him to the ground after he bid them good morning and
stabbed him with a hunting knife before fleeing with cameras and a
pair of binoculars.
	   She has since returned to Britain.
	   Both defendants confessed their guilt to police for the Chivers
killing. But they since have told the court of Principal Magistrate
Julius Mushelle that the confessions were beaten out of them.
However, both confessions have been admitted as evidence in the
trial.
	   Gachau and Wairimu could receive another death sentence if found
guilty of the Chivers murder.
	   Even before being condemned to death for killing Wachira, both
defendants were already on death row for previous crimes of murder
and violent robbery.
	   Kenyan courts frequently hand down death sentences, but no
execution has taken place in Kenya in more than a decade.
	   The East African Standard reported that when, prior to
sentencing the two on Wednesday for the Wachira murder, Mushelle
asked if either had anything to say, he was told they had no
comment ``since we have already been sentenced to death many
times.''

Mubarak defies U.N. embargo to fly to Libya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak flew to
Libya on Thursday to meet Col. Moammar Gadhafi, Libyan television
said. The flight violated a U.N. air embargo.
	   Earlier, Egyptian officials said Mubarak traveled in an aircraft
with several ministers and senior aides. The officials spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   Mubarak is the most senior world leader to defy the air embargo,
which was imposed in 1992 after Gadhafi refused to hand over two
Libyans suspected in the 1988 bombing of an American airliner over
Lockerbie, Scotland that killed 270 people.
	   Mubarak flew from Cairo to Al-Abrak town, 60 kilometers (37
miles) from the northern seaside town of Al-Bayda, the television
said.
	   ``President Hosni Mubarak arrived aboard an Egyptian plane at
Al-Abrak civilian airport,'' a commentator on Libyan television
said in a live broadcast from Al-Abrak where Libyan officials gave
Mubarak a red carpet welcome.
	   Mubarak's visit was not announced and Egypt's official Middle
East News Agency only reported his arrival in Libya at about the
same time Libyan television started its live broadcast.
	   The broadcast was monitored in Cairo.
	   From Al-Abrak, Mubarak drove to Al-Bayda where he met with
Gadhafi who is recovering from a surgery to repair a hip bone he
broke on Monday while exercising. Al-Bayda is 1,400 kilometers (865
miles) east of Tripoli, the Libyan capital.
	   The state Libyan television showed Mubarak shaking hands with
Gadhafi who sat on a wheel chair dressed in a golden brown
traditional Libyan gown. Mubarak also kissed Gadhafi on both cheeks
and inquired about his health.
	   Large crowds of Libyans greeted Mubarak on his arrival at the
Al-Abrak airport, the television said.
	   No reason was given for the visit, but Mubarak was believed to
have gone to Libya to wish Gadhafi a speedy recovery after his
surgery.
	   During their meeting, Gadhafi's doctors showed Mubarak three
X-rays of the broken hip.
	   Since the surgery on Monday, Gadhafi, 56, is reported to be in
good condition and resumed normal work on Wednesday, the Libyan
official news agency JANA said. Gadhafi's surgery was broadcast by
Libyan television on Tuesday.
	   Mubarak has visited Libya many times since 1992 but has always
driven across the Egyptian-Libyan border.
	   Last month, the Organization of African Unity urged member
states to ignore the sanctions for visits with humanitarian and
religious implications or those relating to official OAU work.
	   But until Thursday's flight by Mubarak, only Chad and Niger had
heeded the call, and Gadhafi twice canceled a visit to Egypt last
month, apparently angered by Egypt's refusal to let him fly to
Cairo.
	   Libya recently launched a campaign to win wider support from the
22-nation Arab League to lift the U.N. embargo. In September 1997,
the League had urged member states to ``take steps to ease the
toughness of the sanctions.''

Spain's Balearic Islands deploy language police
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain's Balearic Islands, one of Europe's
top tourist attractions, is forcing businesses that advertise or
label products in foreign languages to provide matching Spanish or
Catalan.
	   The Mediterranean islands of Mallorca, Menorca, Ibiza and
Formentera lure millions of tourists each year, many of them
British and German. In some beach resorts virtually all advertising
_ from menus to real estate ads _ is written in the languages of
the visitors.
	   Enforcing a consumer-protection law passed by the regional
parliament in March, inspectors have begun checking 1,000
establishments for foreign-language ads and labels to make sure
they are accompanied by ones that locals can understand, regional
government officials said Thursday.
	   ``We have detected discrimination in favor of foreigners and
against Spaniards,'' said Juan Morell, director of the consumer
protection office in Palma de Mallorca.
	   He cited as an example a complaint about a store that catered to
Germans so closely that its price tags were in Deutsch marks rather
than pesetas.
	   Goods with exclusively foreign-language labels will be seized
from store shelves immediately, Morell said. Merchants who
advertise in foreign languages will have up to 90 days to provide
local equivalents, with infractions punishable by a fine of up to
2.5 million pesetas (dlrs 16,000).
	   Morell said the fine would depend on the size of the business.
The maximum penalty would be imposed, for example, on a big hotel
that defied a warning to abide by the new regulation.

Taiwan launches diplomatic offensive following setback
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNIE HUANG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan is renewing its bid for U.N.
membership and pushing for increased economic ties with Europe to
avoid the further diplomatic isolation it fears could follow U.S.
President Bill Clinton's visit to China.
	   During the China summit, Clinton stated publicly the U.S. policy
that it does not support Taiwanese independence, a separate Taiwan
government or the island's bid to join the United Nations.
	   Taiwanese fear that such a public pledge could reduce Taiwan's
room to maneuver for more world recognition.
	   On Wednesday, it gathered its small pool of diplomatic allies to
launch a bid for the sixth straight year for U.N. membership.
Meanwhile, the economics minister will lead a 65-member delegation
to six European countries, promising investment and infrastructure
contracts in exchange for a higher international profile.
	   Taiwan is the seat of the Nationalist government that fled the
communist takeover of the Chinese mainland in 1949. China considers
Taiwan a renegade province with no right to its own foreign
relations.
	   While annoyed by Clinton's statement, Taiwanese officials say
they want Washington to at least keep its promise to help Taiwan
make its voice heard in the world.
	   Seeking to ease Taiwan's concerns, Richard Bush, Washington's
top liaison official, visited the island early this week.
	   Bush said Clinton's comments would not hurt Taiwan's interests.
	   The Foreign Ministry said Thursday 11 Latin American, African
and Caribbean countries have proposed that the United Nations
reconsider its 1971 resolution to exclude Taiwan and admit China.
	   The bid is expected to be blocked again by China. Since 1971,
the United Nations has accepted the claim of the Beijing government
to be the only legitimate government of all of China.
	   ``We don't have any illusion of entering the United Nations in a
short period of time,'' said Hsia Li-yen, head of the ministry's
Department of International Organizations, ``but we want to
highlight the issue by bringing it up again.''
	   China must realize that reunification should be based on mutual
respect and mutual trust and ``isolation, suppression and threat
shall only widen the gap between our peoples,'' Hsia told a news
conference.
	   Most countries in the world recognize China, while Taiwan is
recognized by 27 countries.
	   Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang will visit Germany, France,
Italy, Belgium, Austria and Netherlands in the next two weeks and
hopes to sign investment guarantee agreements, ministry officials
said.
	   All the six countries recognize Beijing, and China has warned
them against official contacts with Taiwan, officials said.
	   The 65-member delegation includes executives from Taiwan's
state-run power, petroleum and aerospace companies, and the private
China Steel and China Trust groups. Many plan investment or big
purchases there.
	   In Brussels, Wang is expected to finalize Taiwan's bilateral
negotiations with the European Union on the island's entry into the
World Trade Organization.

Explosion kills four in Istanbul's spice market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ An explosion ripped through the heart of
Istanbul's tourist area Thursday, killing four people and seriously
injuring five, NTV television reported.
	   Initial reports said the explosion in the historic spice market
was triggered by a faulty gas container used for a stove at a food
stand. But bomb disposal experts rushed to the scene to verify the
cause of the blast, NTV said.
	   No further details, including the identities or nationalities of
the victims, were available.

New commander of Israel's armed forces takes office
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, an Iranian-born career
officer, on Thursday took over as head of the Israeli armed forces
after a bitter wrangle with a rival for the top job.
	   As Israel's 16th chief of staff, Mofaz will have to contend with
the emerging threat of long-range missiles and non-conventional
weapons in the hands of Israel's enemies, including Iran and Syria.
	   Mofaz, 50, also inherits an ongoing war against Iranian-backed
guerrillas in southern Lebanon. With a steady toll of casualties,
there have been growing demands in Israel for a unilateral
withdrawal from southern Lebanon.
	   In a ceremony Thursday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
Mofaz would have to prepare the armed forces to meet the threat
from Iraq and Iran and other Mideastern countries aspiring to
obtain nuclear warheads for ballistic missiles.
	   ``I am confident that the armed forces and the new chief of
staff are capable of meeting this challenge,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Born in 1948 in Iran, Mofaz immigrated to Israel in 1957. He was
drafted in 1966 and fought as a paratrooper in the 1967 Mideast
war. In the 1973 Mideast war, he served as commander of a
paratrooper reconnaissance unit. He also took part in the 1976
rescue raid of hostages in Entebbe, Uganda.
	   More recently, Mofaz served as head of Southern Command, head of
the planning division at the general staff and deputy chief of
staff.
	   Mofaz was chosen for the top military post over the more
experienced Maj. Gen. Matan Vilnai who has said he had been led to
believe by Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai that he had the job.
Vilnai left the army prematurely last week.
	   Mofaz is replacing Lt. Gen. Amnon Shahak, 54, who according to
Israeli media speculation is expected to enter politics, possibly
by joining the opposition Labor Party.
	   The regular term of a chief of staff is three years, but it is
often extended for another year.

Soldiers in heavy fighting with Muslim rebels in southern
</HEADLINE>
Philippines &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ About 50 government soldiers and
militiamen entered a Muslim rebel-controlled area in the southern
Philippines, touching off heavy clashes, a rebel leader said
Thursday.
	   Ghadzali Jaafar, chief peace negotiator for the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front, said the number of casualties was still unknown
in the fighting, which started early Wednesday in Pigcawayan in
North Cotabato province.
	   Jaafar said the clashes began after government soldiers failed
to observe an agreement to inform the rebel group when they enter a
rebel-controlled area.
	   The government and the MILF have agreed to a cease-fire, but it
has been violated frequently by both sides.
	   A government spokesman confirmed the clash but refused to give
details or comment on the rebel charges.
	   Jaafar said that aside from the government patrol, there were
reports that tanks and armored personnel carriers had been brought
to the area, forcing hundreds of civilian Muslim residents to flee.
	   He said other Muslim residents, many of them relatives of Muslim
rebels, have armed themselves with AK-47 rifles and grenade
launchers to resist the alleged intrusion.
	   ``Right now, tension is running high,'' Jaafar said.
	   He said he will present a complaint to the government when peace
talks are resumed after newly inaugurated President Joseph Estrada
appoints a new batch of government negotiators.
	   The MILF, which has been holding peace talks with the government
since last year, is the bigger of two Muslim groups still fighting
the government. The largest Muslim rebel group, the Moro National
Liberation Front, signed a peace pact in 1996.

Malaysia-Singapore dispute will not move to international court
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia has rejected Singapore's
proposal to submit a dispute over moving a border checkpoint to the
International Court of Justice, the foreign minister said Thursday.
	   Singapore plans to move its customs, immigration and quarantine
checkpoint from the island's Tanjung Pagar train station, in the
south, to a new site on the Malaysian border at the Woodlands
station Aug. 1.
	   Malaysia initially agreed to relocate from the Tanjung Pagar
station, which is owned by a Malaysian company, KTM Berhad, but
later changed its mind. The move, planned by Singapore since 1989,
would effectively shut down Malaysia's customs office at the old
location.
	   Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said the dispute, which
Singapore had proposed referring to the International Court of
Justice, would better be handled by the neighbors themselves.
	   ``A negotiated settlement is better since the dispute does not
involve a specific treaty,'' Abdullah was quoted as saying by the
Bernama news agency. It falls under a less formal accord called The
Points of Agreement, signed in 1990.
	   Abdullah said several Malaysian officials were currently in
Singapore to discuss the checkpoint's relocation and how it would
affect travelers.
	   Abdullah added that a settlement could be reached if Singapore
sincerely wanted to negotiate and improve ties with Malaysia.
	   Tension has risen between the two countries recently over issues
ranging from a water-supply agreement and territorial dispute to a
diplomatic snub.
	   Abdullah, asked to describe the state of relations, said, ``I am
not unhappy but I'm aware that there are many problems. And
sometimes I feel we shouldn't be raising issues which are
sensitive.''
	   The focus, he said, should be on revitalizing the flagging
economies, both of which have been hit by a regional downturn.
	   ``Perhaps this is the time we begin to think more in terms of
what we can do to help in bringing about economic recovery, because
there is a certain strong linkage between the economies of Malaysia
and Singapore,'' the minister said.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The love letters are waiting. The
birthday cards are waiting. The bills are waiting.
	   Mail piled up in post offices across India Thursday as most of
the estimated 650,000 workers in India's postal department began an
indefinite strike to demand higher wages and bonuses.
	   Later Thursday, Minister for Communications Sushma Swaraj met
with union representatives to try to end the strike.
	   The strikers want their wages increased to 3,050 rupees (dlrs
72) a month from the present 2,750 rupees (dlrs 65) most postal
employees get. The average per capita income in India, one of the
world's poorest countries, is dlrs 450.
	   ``We work very hard. We deserve to be paid much better,'' said
Dharampal Singh, secretary of the All India Postal Employees Union.
``We have to carry huge parcels and are paid worse than porters. We
face the risk of being robbed or killed when we carry fat checks or
money orders.''
	   Local news agencies had reported employees who deliver the mail
did not join the strike, but delivery workers were on the picket
lines Thursday.
	   Groups of employees demonstrated outside post offices,
displaying banners and shouting anti-government slogans. Inside,
customers lined up at counters staffed by retired employees hired
to help out during the strike.
	   British tourist Chris Mclellan and his girlfriend returned
disappointed from a New Delhi post office where they had gone to
collect mail from their families in London.
	   ``We've been seriously inconvenienced,'' said Mclellan, a
university student.

Veteran Lebanese singer-actress Noor el-Huda dies at 74
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese singer and actress Noor El-Huda
who recorded more than 100 songs in a career that began at the age
10 died Thursday after a short illness, the state-run radio said.
She was 74.
	   Noor el-Huda was admitted to the St. Georges hospital in Beirut
on June 27 suffering from a liver and lung infection, the radio
said.
	   Born Alexandra Nicholas Badran, she changed her name to Noor
el-Huda, or Light of Guidance, at the behest of Youssif Wahbi, the
dean of Arab theater, after he invited her to play opposite him in
his film Jawhara (The Jewel).
	   In that movie, as in the more than 30 movies that followed, Noor
el-Huda gained attention for refusing to kiss or wear revealing
clothes on screen.
	   This earned her respect from conservative Arabs and she was
given medals by the Russian Orthodox church and Lebanon's Greek
Orthodox Church in addition to decorations from the Lebanese and
Syrian governments.
	   Along with cinema she made her name in music. Beginning her
career at the age 10, she became known as the ``girl with the
golden voice,'' and in later years recorded more than 100 songs for
the Arab world's most prominent composers and lyricists.
	   For reasons never explained fully, Noor el-Huda withdrew from
the limelight in the 60s. She went into seclusion and moved with
her sister after her house in Beirut was destroyed during the
1975-1990 civil war.
	   Noor el-Huda was one of few people with a street named after
them in their lifetime in the Lebanese capital.
	   She was not known to have married and will be buried in Beirut
on Friday.

Australian minister condemns isolationist party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Australia's visiting foreign minister
on Thursday condemned a new right-wing party's anti-Asian policies
as insular and potentially disastrous for his nation's future.
	   Downer's speech to Indonesian and Australian business leaders
and diplomats in Jakarta followed an upsurge in popular support for
Pauline Hanson's One Nation party, which won 11 of 89 Queensland
state Parliament seats last month due to growing dissatisfaction
with the major parties.
	   Hanson has called for trade protectionism and curbs on Asian
immigration at a time when Australia has been seeking to forge
greater ties with the region.
	   ``One Nation promotes an insular Australia _ inward looking,
narrow-minded, protectionist and separated from the region and the
world,'' Downer said. ``Down that path lies disaster for Australia,
and the government will not take it.''
	   He said Hanson's comments were thoughtless and were endangering
Australian export earnings and jobs.
	   ``It is sad that she is willing to risk the future of Australian
families for the sake of ambition and fleeting notoriety,'' Downer
said.
	   The minister said the One Nation Party had won support among
some Australians who found rapid change from globalization
disconcerting.

Riot's wreckage still smoldering, Nigeria awakes to calm
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with military junta planning to meet Thursday to
discuss handover to civilian rule. &QL; 
 &UR; By FRANK AIGBOGUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Black smoke billowed up over a large
market in central Lagos on Thursday from a blaze police say was set
by youths enraged at the death of the country's leading political
prisoner.
	   Although parts of Lagos were calm after two tumultuous days, the
fire at the Agege Market warned that life in Nigeria was far from
returning to normal.
	   The country's ruling military junta was preparing to meet
Thursday to discuss plans to hand over power to civilians and
release Nigeria's remaining political prisoners.
	   The military's Provisional Ruling Council was also to discuss
the fate of several people convicted earlier this year of plotting
a coup against the late dictator Gen. Sani Abacha.
	   Nigeria's former deputy ruler Gen. Oladipo Diya and five others
were sentenced to die by firing squad in connection with the
alleged coup plot.
	   The junta was rocked and is under fire after the death of
Moshood Abiola, Nigeria's best-known political prisoner, who died
while still in detention on Tuesday.
	   The arson in Lagos is the latest fallout after shock at the
death of Abiola turned to rage and boiled over into deadly rioting
on Wednesday.
	   Police and firefighters battled the blaze that started
mid-morning in several market stalls. Several houses were
reportedly also set alight by marauding groups of youths.
	   Abiola, the man many hoped would become Nigeria's next civilian
president, died Tuesday after falling ill during a meeting with
visiting U.S. dignitaries.
	   The government says he died of a heart attack, but authorities
plan an autopsy. The procedure may be performed Thursday, a
relative of Abiola said on condition of anonymity.
	   Rioters on Wednesday tore through parts of the commercial
capital of Lagos, the southern university town of Ibadan and
Abiola's hometown of Abeokuta. At least 19 people were killed in
the violence.
	   Police used tear gas to quell the violence that began to ebb
Wednesday evening.
	   Many people in Lagos stayed home. The smoldering ruins of the
mayhem, piles of burning tires, were left along street corners.
	   On Wednesday, Nigeria's new military leader added to the
confusion situation by dissolving his Cabinet. However, Gen.
Abdulsalam Abubakar left untouched the country's Provisional Ruling
Council, the core of the junta that rules this oil-rich but
poverty-wracked nation.
	   He had inherited the Cabinet from dictator Gen. Sani Abacha. who
died June 8 of a heart attack.
	   Abubakar, in a nationwide television address Wednesday night,
called the death of Moshood Abiola a ``national tragedy'' and
appealed for calm.
	   ``Our national grief cannot be assuaged by recourse to
lawlessness,'' he said.
	   He made no mention of his plans for the Cabinet, though he said
that returning Nigeria to democracy was imperative.
	   Abiola, the apparent winner of 1993 presidential elections later
annulled by the military leadership, had been in prison since 1994.
He died Tuesday after suddenly falling ill during a meeting with
U.S. diplomats who were appealing for his freedom. He was 60.
	   A potent symbol of reform for Nigeria's poor masses, Abiola was
enormously popular in Nigeria's southwest, home of his Yoruba
ethnic group, where a growing number of people are blaming the
military for his death. The government said Abiola died of a heart
attack.
	   Col. Mohammed Marwa, the popular military administrator of Lagos
state, appealed for calm in an afternoon radio broadcast on
Wednesday.
	   ``Violence will not profit anyone,'' he said, adding: ``Only God
knows why He has taken Abiola away at this crucial period of
national reconciliation.''
	   Some of the violence was ethnic-based, with Yorubas from
Nigeria's southwest attacking Hausas. Hausas and Fulanis, both from
the north, make up a majority in the military and the junta.
	   While Abiola reportedly had been very ill last year, his death
came as a surprise, just days after U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan announced that all Nigeria's political prisoners would be
freed, including Abiola.
	   The U.S. State Department said there was no reason to believe
that Abiola's death was from anything other than natural causes.
	   But Abiola's family was suspicious, jaded by the oppressiveness
of the Abacha years.
	   ``I suspect that he was poisoned, that he was murdered,'' his
daughter Hafsat said in an interview.
	   Abubakar said in his speech that an autopsy would be conducted
in cooperation with the Abiola family, and that pathologists were
being flown in from the United States, Canada and the United
Kingdom.

Militant leader urges holy war against U.S., Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Muslim militant groups have agreed that a holy war
against the United States and Israel is a religious duty, a leading
Egyptian militant was quoted Thursday as saying.
	   Ayman al-Zawahry, considered the leader of al-Jihad, successor
of the group that assassinated Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, said
the world ``Muslim movement'' has no other choice but to wage war
against the United States ``because it humiliates all Muslims.''
	   ``America insists on humiliating the (Muslim) nation, robbing
its resources, and imposing collective sanctions on it,'' Zawahry
told Kuwait's Al-Rai Al-Amm daily. The interview was conducted by
fax through a mediator from an undisclosed location.
	   Al-Zawahry said Muslims should also wage the same war against
Israel, which he said flourished at the expense of Arabs.
	   ``Therefore, the only choice which is left for the Muslim nation
is to wage a holy war against America and Israel,'' he said.
	   Al-Zawahry did not name the other groups. But earlier this year,
Saudi billionaire Osama Bin Laden, who lives in Afghanistan, was
reported to have forged a new alliance of radical groups which
vowed to fight a holy war against Americans.
	   Al-Zawahry, a doctor also believed to live in Afghanistan, was
released from an Egyptian prison in 1985 after serving four years
for belonging to the group that assassinated Sadat in 1981. Later,
he was sentenced to death in absentia on other charges.
	   Last month, Egyptian police detained 17 people and accused them
of trying to revive the group which was largely crushed following
Sadat's assassination. Other reports suggested that the men were
also planing to kidnap Americans in Egypt.
	   Zawahry said Egypt has imprisoned 3,000 members of his group.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A fire raced through parched grass and
olive trees near ancient ruins at the foot of the Acropolis on
Thursday, forcing tourists to dodge billowing smoke and stranding
firefighters on narrow streets.
	   The blaze, which burned for about an hour, broke out between the
Roman Agora, or market place, and the Tower of the Winds, a more
than 2,000-year-old pillar that served as a sun dial and weather
vane.
	   Firefighters had troubled reaching the site in the historic
Plaka district. Most fire trucks became stuck on the narrow,
winding streets. Residents used extinguishers and garden hoses to
help battle the flames.
	   No injuries were reported. The cause of the fire was not
immediately clear.
	   More than 180 forest and brush fires swept the country beginning
Saturday, leaving dozens of homes and thousands of acres (hectares)
of forest and farm land destroyed. At least two deaths have been
blamed on the fires.
	   Three people have been arrested on arson charges in the past
week, while another three have been charged with negligence in
connection with the weekend fires.

Italy, Libya sign agreement pledging to fight terrorism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy and Libya signed an agreement Thursday which
included vows to fight terrorism, respect human rights and combat
the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
	   A statement from the foreign ministry said the two sides pledged
to ``close for good a history of conflicts,'' which began when
Italy invaded Libya in 1911.
	   Libya, which is under U.N. sanctions for refusing to surrender
two suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner, in the past
has been accused of building chemical weapons factories. It has
always denied the charge.
	   Italy's foreign minister Lamberto Dini and Libya's Omar
al-Muntasser signed the agreement following a week of talks.
	   Closer relations between Libya and Italy, ``are important for
the security of the Mediterranean area,'' Dini told La Repubblica
daily. ``We are convinced (Col. Moammar) Gadhafi has adopted more
responsible policies ... Tripoli is no longer involved in terrorist
acts.''
	   Dini's talks with the Libyans fit into broader Italian efforts
to improve Western relations with countries under U.N. or U.S.
embargo or shunned for suspected support of terrorism.
	   Earlier this month, Premier Romano Prodi became the first
European Union leader to travel to Iran for talks since 1992.
Earlier this year Dini went to Cuba, a country under U.S. embargo.
	   Relations between Italy and Libya hit a low in 1986 when Tripoli
fired a missile at the tiny Sicilian island of Lampedusa to
retaliate for U.S. bombings of two Libyan cities. But Italy is
heavily dependant on Libyan petroleum and gas, and relations, while
tested at times, have endured.

Twelve killed, eight injured in two attacks in Burundi

<TEXT>
	   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) _ Unidentified assailants have killed 12
people and injured eight others in two separate attacks in southern
and northwestern Burundi, a military source said Thursday.
	   Twelve members of two families were hacked to death with
machetes Tuesday night in Kinoso, Makaba province, about 80
kilometer (50 miles) south of Bujumbura, one source said on
condition his name not be used.
	   The official military spokesman was unavailable for comment.
	   The raiders then set fire to nine homes before attacking two
shopping centers, where they injured four people and stole food,
the source said.
	   During the same night, another group raided a village in Bubanza
province, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of Bujumbura,
injured four people and stole an unspecified number of cattle and
goats.
	   The source declined to speculate on the identity of the
attackers and the victims. But Hutu rebels fighting the
Tutsi-dominated army routinely attack both Tutsis and Hutus they
suspect of collaborating with government soldiers.
	   On June 21, participants in the first all-party peace talks on
Burundi agreed to a cease-fire and pledged to resolve the country's
bloody conflicts through peaceful means.
	   The cease-fire was to take effect no later than July 20 when the
second round of talks is supposed to begin.
	   Although there have been no reports of clashes between the army
and the rebels, both parties raised doubts about their commitment.
	   The army said it was not bound by the cease-fire because its job
was to maintain peace. The main rebel group, the Council for the
Defense of Democracy, said the person who signed the accord in the
group's name had no mandate to do so.

 &UR; German foreign minister meets Kosovo refugees, warns Serbia
 &UR; By MERITA DHIMGJOKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) - On a mission to contain Balkan tensions,
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel urged Kosovo Albanians on
Thursday to drop a quest for full independence from Serbia, while
warning that NATO intervention remained an option.
	   Kinkel met in the border region of Bajram Curri with ethnic
Albanians who fled from Kosovo to Albania to escape the violence in
the Serbian province before leaving for Macedonia, with its own
sizable and restive ethnic Albanian population.
	   ``I asked the Albanian government to support those Albanian
forces in Macedonia who are in favor of cooperation and dialogue,''
said Kinkel before departure. ``I asked the Albanian government to
object to the further radicalization of the situation in Kosovo.
	   ``We want to give Albania and Macedonia stability injections in
order to prevent the spreading of the conflict in the region,'' he
said. While acknowledging the Kosovo Albanian wish for full
independence, Kinkel said ``secession ... will not be supported by
the international community.''
	   The United States and others in the six-member Contact Group
trying to cap Balkan tensions have recently eased away from
threatening military action in Kosovo.
	   Faced with opposition to that plan from Contact Group member
Russia, they instead now are pushing for a negotiated settlement
between Serbia, the larger of Yugoslavia's two republics, and
Kosovo Albanians wanting to break the province away from Serbia.
	   But Kinkel said Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic ``should
know that if political action fails there is (still) a military
option.''
	   Kinkel said the Western European Union _ the European Union's
fledgling military wing _ was considering ways of helping Albania
stop arms smuggling into neighboring Kosovo. Albania asserts it
favors interdiction but does not have the means to control its
rugged and lawless northern border.
	   And he said that while the Contact Group considers pacifist
Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova the main negotiator of a
settlement, ``we will talk to anyone'' _ including the Kosovo
Liberation Army fighting for independence.
	   Kinkel and other Contact Group representatives, meeting in Bonn,
Germany to try and stop the Kosovo fighting, called Wednesday on
governments for the first time to intercept the flow of funds to
the ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   Acknowledging the rising strength of the militant Kosovo
Liberation Army, the Contact Group warned of possible sanctions
against the fighters if they stand in the way of new peace talks.

Rogue monkey eludes police, terrorizes city residents
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A wild monkey has eluded police armed with nets and
bananas in the central Japanese city of Osaka, abducting pets and
terrorizing schoolchildren.
	   Police continued their hunt Thursday for the monkey, which a
city official said probably had descended into Japan's
third-largest city from mountains near its eastern edge.
	   No injuries have been reported since the one-meter
(three-foot)-tall monkey first appeared Tuesday.
	   Police cornered the monkey at one point Wednesday but had to
back off after it seized two kittens. They feared the monkey might
harm the other animals, said the city official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   The monkey escaped. The kittens' fate was unknown.
	   Also Wednesday, officials at an elementary school in the nearby
town of Settsu locked windows and ordered children not to go home
alone after the monkey appeared on the building's roof.
	   The monkey slipped away even after police and television camera
crews surrounded the school.
	   Dozens of police conducted a house-to-house search Thursday of
neighborhoods in eastern Osaka.
	   They warned residents to avoid eye contact with the monkey,
which might provoke an attack.
	   The policemen moved in pairs, one carrying a two-meter
(6.5-foot) pole with bananas dangling from the end and the other
holding a large net.
	   Monkeys have long been a problem in many areas in rural Japan,
where they damage crops, swipe food from grocery stalls and even
bite humans.
	   Monkey population growth in recent years means they are making
more frequent forays out of the forests and into the farms and
towns.
	   The monkeys, a species of macaque, are one of the most common

Court condemns Belgium over EU voting rights
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union's high court found
Belgium guilty Thursday of violating EU law by refusing to grant
voting rights to foreign residents coming from other EU nations.
	   The ruling could lead to the country hosting EU headquarters
paying fines of up to 7.5 million francs (dlrs 200,000) a day until
it complies.
	   Under EU law adopted in 1994, citizens from the 15 EU nations
who move to another member country should be allowed to vote and
stand in municipal elections in their host nations.
	   Only Belgium has refused to extend voting rights,
disenfranchising some the 650,000 residents from the other EU
nations _ many of them working at the EU.
	   The reasons for Belgium's reluctance lie in the linguistic
squabbles between Dutch- and French-speaking Belgians.
	   Since most of the newcomers speak French, rather than Dutch, as
a second language, many Dutch-speaking Flemish politicians fear the
foreigners will vote overwhelmingly for French-speaking parties,
particularly in and around Brussels.
	   That, they say, could tip a delicate linguistic and political
balance in the capital and its suburbs in favor of their
Francophone rivals.
	   Opposition from Flemish lawmakers means the government has been
unable to muster the two-thirds majority in parliament needed to
amend Belgium's constitution to take account of the European law.
	   Following Thursday's verdict in the Luxembourg-based European
Court of Justice, the European Commission said it would give
Belgium up to five months to change its laws.
	   If not, the EU's executive body said will open a second case
that could lead to heavy fines kicking in as early as next year.
Commission officials said they hoped the threat of fines would
prompt Belgium to allow foreigners to vote by the time the next
scheduled municipal elections are held in 2000.
	   In 1994, Belgium did allow other EU nationals to vote in its
elections to the European Parliament, but few bothered.
	   Of the 200,000 Italians eligible to vote in Belgium, just 16,000
cast their ballots. A mere 600 of the 20,000 British voted, and
only 200 of the 16,000 Portuguese.

Judge: Tehran mayor's work to have impact on verdict

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A judge hearing the corruption trial of
Tehran's reformist mayor said Thursday that his verdict will take
into account the official's efforts to improve the capital city.
	   The judge, Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejaei, who also acts as the
prosecutor in keeping with Iranian laws, made the assurance after
wrapping up the government's case at the end of a four-hour
session.
	   Mayor Gholamhossein Karbaschi, who has pleaded innocent to the
charges of corruption and embezzlement, will begin his defense on
Saturday.
	   Karbaschi's trial is widely seen as an attempt by hard-liners in
the ruling clergy to topple key officials allied with moderate
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami. Karbaschi ran Khatami's
election campaign last year.
	   ``Karbaschi was a phenomenon among the officials of the country,
but now this phenomenon has turned to a legendary hero and has
become part of Iranian history,'' said Bahman Keshavarz, one of
Karbaschi's lawyers.
	   Another defense lawyer, Masoud Haeri, lashed out at the court,
accusing it of failing to recognize Karbaschi's work.
	   His spoke of some of Karbaschi's achievements over the past
eight years, including the construction of 500 parks and numerous
highways.
	   Judge Mohseni interrupted to warn Haeri that he was close to
committing contempt of court.
	   ``If you don't respect the court's reputation, I will order that
you be expelled. What you are saying is an insult to the court,''
Mohseni said.
	   However, the judge told reporters later that Karbaschi's work in
office will be taken into account.
	   ``His services and achievements will have an impact on the
verdict,'' he said.
	   In past sessions, Karbaschi had sparred boldly with the judge
and accused authorities of torturing senior municipality officials
in a bid to make them testify against him.
	   On Thursday, Karbaschi appeared relaxed and composed, speaking
only occasionally in a low voice.
	   Mohseni said the verdict will be issued in the next two weeks.
	   If convicted, Karbaschi faces up to 10 years in jail, a fine and
a ban from holding public office.

New Philippine government willing to compromise with Marcos family
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By OLIVER TEVES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The government of new President
Joseph Estrada is willing to compromise with the family and
associates of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos to end years of
fruitless efforts to recover their alleged ill-gotten wealth and
unpaid taxes, an official said Thursday.
	   Presidential Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said the
government will resort to a settlement ``if we cannot use any other
way'' and in cases ``where years have dragged on.''
	   ``This is not a question of whether we are open or not to an
amicable settlement with a particular individual. It is whether we
see that as an efficient way of disposing of particular cases,'' he
said.
	   Since Marcos was ousted in a ``people power'' revolt in 1986,
the government has been locked in a legal battle with his family
over about dlrs 540 million in his Swiss bank accounts, part of
billions of dollars the government claims he embezzled during his
20-year rule.
	   The money, frozen since 1986, has been transferred to an escrow
account in a Philippine bank under the condition that it will be
released to the government only if it wins a criminal case against
Marcos' widow, Imelda, in connection with the funds, and if victims
of human rights abuses under his government are fairly compensated.
	   Another way to acquire the money, however, is through an
out-of-court settlement with the Marcos family, but the Supreme
Court has barred the government from negotiating an agreement with
the Marcoses.
	   Zamora said the government may push Congress to approve a
compromise agreement with the Marcos family that was aborted in
1995. Under it, the government would have received 75 percent of
the Swiss money in exchange for immunity for the Marcoses.
	   Felix de Guzman, chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good
Government, the agency in charge of recovering the Marcos wealth,
also said compromises could settle the long legal battles.
	   ``The PCGG will not be adversarial this time,'' de Guzman said.
``We will explore the possibility of compromise settlements in all
those pending cases.''
	   There are 102 pending civil cases against the Marcoses and their
associates in the anti-graft court, 36 in the Supreme Court, five
in the Court of Appeals, and 52 in various local courts. There are
also 27 criminal cases against the Marcoses and their associates in
the anti-graft court, 55 in lower courts and 46 cases under
investigation by the government ombudsman.
	   Estrada, a former Marcos supporter, has said he wants the good
government commission abolished in six months. The ill-gotten
wealth cases would then be turned over to the Justice Department or
the office of the president.
	   Anti-Marcos groups have expressed concern over efforts to
negotiate settlements with the Marcos family and their associates.
	   ``Any agreement with the Marcoses should not absolve them of
their crimes against the Filipino people nor should they be granted
immunity from future suits,'' said Marie Enriquez, a leader of a
group of former political detainees under Marcos.

 &UR; Palestinian negotiators leave for Washington to meet with Albright &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Palestinian negotiators leaving for
Washington, quotes from Netanyahu, Palestinian Cabinet minister &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian negotiators, who have been summoned
to Washington by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, will
not accept changes in a U.S. proposal for an Israeli troop pullback
in the West Bank, a Palestinian Cabinet minister said Thursday.
	   The negotiators, Nabil Shaath and Saeb Erekat, left for the
United States early Thursday, following a phone call between
Albright and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   ``There are certain issues she (Albright) wants to present to
the Palestinian side,'' said Hanan Ashrawi, Palestinian minister of
higher education.
	   The Palestinian envoys will listen, but ``will not renegotiate
the (U.S.) initiative,'' Ashrawi told a news conference.
	   Some 450 Jewish settlers and 130,000 Palestinians live in
Hebron. The downtown area is patrolled by Israeli troops while 80
percent of the city are under Palestinian Authority control.
	   Israel has demanded that the United States make changes in the
plan which calls for a gradual Israeli pullback from 13 percent of
the West Bank, accompanied by Palestinian security measures.
	   Israel reportedly is ready to hand over 10 percent in full, but
wants to retain control over zoning and planning in the remaining 3
percent.
	   Israel also demands that the Palestinian Authority extradite
suspects in the killings of Israelis and that the Palestine
National Council, rather than the smaller PLO Executive Committee,
annul sections of the PLO Covenant calling for Israel's
destruction.
	   The U.S. initiative does not call for the extradition of wanted
men and is satisfied with a vote on the covenant by the PLO
Executive Committee.
	   Israel radio said Thursday that Washington has agreed only to
cosmetic changes in the original initiative which was accepted by
the Palestinians several weeks ago.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday it was
up to the Palestinians to achieve a breakthrough. The Palestinians
should carry out their commitments, such as confiscating illegal
weapons and reducing the size of their police force, he said.
	   The Palestinians have accused Netanyahu of playing for time in
hopes of eventually wriggling out of his commitment to hand over
more land. ``The peace process is not only in a state of deadlock.
We feel that it has been destroyed by Netanyahu,'' Ashrawi said.
	   In other developments Thursday, Israeli troops imposed a curfew
on parts of downtown Hebron after shots were fired at a car driven
by Jewish settlers.

Vicar sentenced to 2 1/2 years in jail for sex with two boys
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ An Anglican priest has been sentenced
to 2 1/2 years prison after admitted having sex with Romanian
street boys, according to court records released Thursday.
	   Rev. Michael Taylor, 35, of Essex in southeastern England, was
not present for the sentencing which took place Wednesday. He was
also ordered to pay court costs of dlrs 90 and 340,000 lei (dlrs
40).
	   Taylor has already served 11 months in a Bucharest jail. He was
removed from his parish by the Church of England last week after he
pleaded guilty.
	   Last August, Taylor was caught by police and film cameras
wearing his underpants with a naked street boy in an apartment used
by prostitutes.
	   He initially pleaded guilty and then switched his plea to
innocent, claiming he had made a guilty plea on a bargain with
police for his release.
	   Last week, Taylor pleaded guilty of having oral sex with two
13-year-old street boys.
	   The maximum penalty for sex with minors of the same sex is seven
years and the minimum is two years.
	   Romania has attracted foreign pedophiles in recent years because
of thousands of street children who are prepared to have sex for
small favors and food.

Lawmakers say India should spend more on its defense
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The government should spend more than
the 412 billion rupees (dlrs 10 billion) it proposes for India's
defense, lawmakers urged Thursday.
	   Parliament's Standing Committee on Defense said in a report that
the military allocation presented as part of the budget proposal
earlier this month, which was 14.3 percent higher than in the
previous year, did not accord ``the defense of our country (the)
due priority it deserves.''
	   The committee said the increase would be just enough to cover
higher salaries and meet the inflation rate of 6 percent, leaving
nothing for modernizing weaponry.
	   Military experts have said much of the defense budget, which has
been declining in recent years, went for maintaining conventional
weapons.
	   In May, India carried out a series of nuclear tests, saying it
feared its neighbors China and Pakistan. Pakistan responded with
its own tests two weeks later.
	   In a budget announced soon after the tests, Finance Minister
Yashwant Sinha said he would consider spending more than the
proposed 412 billion rupees (dlrs 10 billion) on defense.
	   Annual defense spending has been about 2.4 percent of the gross
domestic product in the past decade. Lawmakers in the past have
demanded that the defense spending should be raised to three
percent of GDP.

JonBenet's parents vow to find her killer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The parents of JonBenet Ramsey, the six-year-old
murdered American beauty queen, break a 14-month silence in a
British television interview Thursday night proclaiming they are
innocent and vowing to find her killer.
	   ``I don't know what happened,'' her mother Patsy Ramsey said in
a Channel 4 documentary, according to highlights published in The
Times of London on Thursday. ``God knows, and He's not telling.''
	   JonBenet was found beaten and strangled Dec. 26, 1996 in her
home in Boulder, Colorado. There have been no arrests, and
authorities have said only that Patsy and John Ramsey are under
suspicion. The Ramseys have denied any involvement.
	   Newsweek reporters Sherry Keene-Osborn and Daniel Glick, who are
associate producers of the documentary ``Who Killed JonBenet?'',
previewed the show in The Times, saying the Ramseys accused the
media of convicting them of JonBenet's murder.
	   The reporters noted that the child, dressed in a pink cowgirl
outfit singing ``I Wanna Be A Cowboy's Sweatheart,'' or posing in
elaborate clothes, wearing make-up and high heels, has become known
throughout the United States through coverage of her unsolved
murder.
	   ``The American public has been led to believe that, after a
wonderful Christmas, we brutally beat JonBenet, sexually molested
her, strangled her, went to sleep, got up the next morning, wrote a
ransom note, called the police, sat around the house for four
hours, then I went downstairs and discovered her body and was able
to act distraught,'' Ramsey said.
	   ``Patsy was able to throw up that morning because of
gut-wrenching anxiety. Help me to understand that. Where is our
commonsense as a society, as a race of people?,'' he asked.
	   ``The single most important thing to us, from that day until
even now, is to find the killer of our daughter,'' Ramsey said.
``This ... creature.''
	   The Newsweek reporters wrote that the Ramseys displayed a range
of emotions in the interview in the two-story home in suburban
Atlanta where they moved after JonBenet's death.
	   ``Everything in our lives has been scoured,'' Patsy said. ``They
talked with my fourth-grade teacher, my friends from elementary
school. There's nothing. I'm not saying I've been perfect my whole
life, but there is no history of any activity like this. It's
ridiculous.''
	   Ramsey said that when he was told that police had tried to
withhold his daughter's body for burial in order to force an
interrogation, he lost all confidence in them, the reporters wrote.
	   ``They were not there to help us, they were there to hang us,''
he said.
	   The Ramseys denied allegations that John was an avid consumer of
pornography and that he had abused his other children, a view
supported by the children of his first marriage and his first wife,
the reporters wrote. JonBenet's pediatrician also said he never
suspected she was being abused.

	   CAVALESE, Italy (AP) _ A U.S. delegation on Thursday pledged to
help restore tourism in the alpine region where an American jet
sliced a cable car line, sending 20 people plunging to their death.
	   During a visit of the accident site, the group told regional
officials they hoped to hand them a dlrs 20 million check within 90
days. The funds, which must still be approved by the Senate, will
also go towards resconstructing the gondola line.
	   ``We hope the economic recovery will be quick so the ski area
can be rebuilt and we can put this tragic accident behind us,''
Bill Young, Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on National
Security, told reporters in Cavelese.
	   The delegation toured the area to best determine how it could
contribute to reviving the region's tourism-based economy, which
nosedived following the accident.
	   ``I hope that today we can alleviate the difficulties of this
town,'' said U.S. Ambassador to Italy, Thomas Foglietta, who
accompanied the group.
	   Evidence showed the Marine Corps EA-6B Prowler, on a low-level
training mission, was flying too fast and too low when it struck
the cable at the Cermis ski area Feb. 3.
	   Following investigative hearings in Camp Lejeune, N.C., a
military judge recommended courts-martial for the jet's pilot and
navigator on charges including involuntary manslaughter. The judge
asked that charges against two backseat crewmen be dropped.

Hong Kong government announces new projects to curb unemployment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The financial secretary presented new projects
Thursday to stimulate Hong Kong's troubled economy, while admitting
that unemployment would remain ``at a relatively high level for
some time.''
	   In the second meeting of the government task force on
unemployment, Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said progress was
being made on a program to create 100,000 jobs and stimulate the
recession-bound economy.
	   Tsang said the government had a ``good range of ideas,'' which
included mediating disputes between employers and workers to
minimize layoffs, and strengthening retraining programs.
	   ``Short of the onset of an economic recovery, there are no quick
fixes to the problem,'' Tsang added.
	   With unemployment at a 14-year high of 4.2 percent and the
economy shrinking for the first time in 14 years, pressure has
mounted on the government to adopt stronger rescue measures.
	   Economists, business leaders and political parties from across
Hong Kong's spectrum all have said they doubted whether the
government's program was enough to get the economy moving.
	   The task force _ including government officials, academics, and
union and business representatives _ has said that as part of the
program, the government will push ahead with infrastructure
projects, as well as expand maintenance and social services.
	   Tsang said after the second task force meeting that 3,000 jobs
would be created from new tourism projects in the next two years.
More than 3,700 jobs also would be created in the next year for
major repairs in government-run schools.
	   Tsang also announced new programs to train jobless workers to
become seamen or domestic helpers.
	   In keeping with the government's view that there is only a
limited amount it can do to improve the economy, Tsang told the
public not to expect immediate relief.
	   On Wednesday, members of Hong Kong's 60-seat legislature buried
differences during their first working session and voted 51-1 in
favor of a motion demanding deeper tax cuts and fee reductions than
the government has proposed. The move presented Hong Kong's
post-handover government with its first meaningful opposition.
	   The motion has no legal effect, but places the government under
tremendous pressure and could be a sign of things to come.
	   While pro-Beijing politicians and Hong Kong's business elite
form a solid majority generally loyal to the government,
speculation has been rife that the pro-Beijing faction could line
up with government critics on economic issues.

Ousted co-premier promises to seek justice after election
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS two grafs with monitoring group saying violence a setback
to free elections &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MONG RUSSEI, Cambodia (AP) _ While a funeral was held for one of
his murdered supporters, Prince Norodom Ranariddh promised Thursday
to bring the perpetrators of political violence to trial if he wins
elections July 26.
	   Speaking to a crowd of 2,000 in the northwestern province of
Battambang, the prince said he wanted to find justice for those who
were ``brutally murdered'' after he was ousted as co-prime minister
by strongman Hun Sen in a bloody takeover last year.
	   Opponents of Hun Sen say he is trying to ensure victory in the
upcoming polls by using violence, including murder, and
intimidation, plus rigging the electoral machinery in his favor.
	   At least six opposition members have died in political killings
since the electoral campaign began last month. Additionally, human
rights workers say that as many as 100 supporters of Ranariddh's
royalist FUNCINPEC party were killed after his ouster.
	   There have been no arrests by the Hun Sen-controlled legal
machinery in any of the cases.
	   ``I promise to find the culprits and send them to trial. This is
FUNCINPEC's commitment,'' Ranariddh said.
	   A funeral was held near Phnom Penh for FUNCINPEC activist Thong
Sophal, 45, whose body was discovered by police two weeks ago.
	   Thong Sophal's fingers and left ear were cut off and he had been
struck a massive blow to the left side of his head. Authorities
immediately labeled the death a suicide, but human rights workers
said it was political and the injuries suggested torture.
	   Meanwhile, the opposition party headed by dissident Sam Rainsy
reported the death of a party official, Hun Thai, who was shot
while riding his motorbike Tuesday in the southeastern province of
Takeo.
	   Party officials were not yet sure if the killing was political.
	   Hun Sen, who has been Cambodia's most powerful politician since
the mid-1980s, has called the elections to win back international
aid and legitimacy lost because of his takeover.
	   Ranariddh, who was driven into exile by the pitched battles in
the capital, was allowed to return in March following diplomatic
pressure on Hun Sen.
	   In 1993, Ranariddh emerged the winner in U.N.-sponsored polls
backed by thousands of peacekeeping troops, but Hun Sen forced his
way into a coalition by threatening civil war.
	   This time, United Nations assistance is limited to observers and
technical aid.
	   An independent monitoring group, the Committee for Free and Fair
Elections in Cambodia, issued a statement expressing ``deep concern
over widespread cases of election-related violence, threats and
intimidation.''
	   The problems, COMFREL said, have ``taken place in most of the
nation's provinces and represent a significant setback to the
effort to uphold free and fair nationwide polls.''

Italy, Libya sign agreement pledging to fight terrorism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy and Libya signed an agreement Thursday which
included vows to fight terrorism, respect human rights and combat
the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
	   A statement from the foreign ministry said the two sides pledged
to ``close for good a history of conflicts,'' which began when
Italy invaded Libya in 1911.
	   Libya, which is under U.N. sanctions for refusing to surrender
two suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner, in the past
has been accused of building chemical weapons factories. It has
always denied the charge.
	   Italy's foreign minister Lamberto Dini and Libya's Omar
al-Muntasser signed the agreement following a week of talks.
	   Closer relations between Libya and Italy, ``are important for
the security of the Mediterranean area,'' Dini told La Repubblica
daily. ``We are convinced (Col. Moammar) Gadhafi has adopted more
responsible policies ... Tripoli is no longer involved in terrorist
acts.''
	   Dini's talks with the Libyans fit into broader Italian efforts
to improve Western relations with countries under U.N. or U.S.
embargo or shunned for suspected support of terrorism.
	   Earlier this month, Premier Romano Prodi became the first
European Union leader to travel to Iran for talks since 1992.
Earlier this year Dini went to Cuba, a country under U.S. embargo.
	   Relations between Italy and Libya hit a low in 1986 when Tripoli
fired a missile at the tiny Sicilian island of Lampedusa to
retaliate for U.S. bombings of two Libyan cities. But Italy is
heavily dependant on Libyan petroleum and gas, and relations, while
tested at times, have endured.

World Cup: FIFA says Blanc misses final despite French appeal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with suspension automatic, no appeal possible &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ FIFA said Thursday that defender Laurent Blanc will
definitely miss the World Cup final despite any French bid to
appeal his suspension for a red card in the semifinal.
	   The Olympic Marseille star, who has played 73 times for France,
was sent off for the first time in his long career for pushing
Croatian defender Slaven Bilic in the face Wednesday as the two
prepared to chase a free kick.
	   Although they weren't optimistic, French team officials said
they planned to appeal the automatic suspension.
	   But FIFA said that, unless there was a case of mistaken identity
and it wasn't Blanc who committed the offense, there was no chance
of the suspension being dropped.
	   ``A one or two-game ban can't be appealed against,'' said FIFA
spokesman Marius Schneider. ``Only a suspension of three games or
more can be appealed.
	   ``The disciplinary committee doesn't have the power to relieve
him of a suspension for this match.''
	   FIFA regards that as violent conduct and has suspended other
players, such as Dutch striker Patrick Kluivert and Argentina's
Ariel Ortega, for more than one game for similar conduct. Any
suspension means Blanc misses Sunday's final against four-time and
defending titlist Brazil at the Stade de France.
	   Blanc was clearly shown to push Bilic in the face after the two
players had tugged each other shirts. The French felt it was a
yellow rather than a red card offense.
	   ``It was unjust, it was too harsh of the referee,'' French coach
Aime Jacquet said of the expulsion.
	   ``We will appeal but we fear it will be a formality. We always
have hope but I don't want to give Blanc any false hope.''
	   Blanc, scorer of the extra time ``Golden Goal'' against Paraguay
that put the French into the quarterfinal, said he wasn't confident
either that a suspension could be avoided.
	   ``It would be a great surprise,'' he said. ``It would be
unique.''
	   But he's still upset.
	   ``My expulsion punishes the player but the really bad scenario
is that it also punishes the team. I have this feeling of having
tasted the cake, but now I'm not allowed to touch the cherry,''
said Blanc.
	   Bilic said that Blanc's red card was all his own fault.
	   ``I didn't get him sent off, he did,'' the Everton defender
said.
	   ``He touched me, technically that's an offense, and the referee
saw it.
	   ``I'm not happy that he's going to miss the final, but if you do
something like that you're going to get punished. That's all there
is to say about it.''

How do Russian police do it? They cook the books, government says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ On paper, it would be hard to find better police.
For every 100 crimes committed, Russian police solve nearly 80 _ a
success rate roughly double what their counterparts achieve in the
West.
	   How do they do it?
	   The answer, the country's top prosecutor says, is simple: They
lie, cheat and ignore hard-to-solve crimes, all in the interest of
achieving near-perfect success rates.
	   Several Russian newspapers reported on the issue Thursday,
saying senior government officials are drafting a new system of
evaluating police that will discourage the practice of cooking the
books.
	   Under the current system, the newspaper Noviye Izvestia said,
police are encouraged to make lots of arrests for petty
administrative offenses, meanwhile ignoring serious crimes.
	   ``If solving a theft of three hamsters or a contract killing is
all part of the same total, it makes people concentrate on what is
easier to solve,'' the newspaper said.
	   It quoted a police union official, Mikhail Pashkov, as saying
that some Moscow police have a quota that requires them to issue
800 administrative fines a year.
	   The practices described by Prosecutor General Yuri Skuratov and
other top officials are hardly unheard of in other countries. But
the extent of the whitewash might be hard to match.
	   In one Russian region, Ingushetia, which is plagued by unsolved
kidnappings and other crimes, police claim to solve 98 percent of
all crimes.
	   In St. Petersburg, the Moscow Times reported, prosecutors
recently discovered that 600 crimes, including 20 homicides and 30
armed robberies, were simply not registered by police because they
were hard to solve.
	   In one case, the newspaper said, St. Petersburg police found
parts of a mutilated body but did not open a criminal
investigation. Their explanation: There were no witnesses to prove
a murder.
	   Even when there is a witness, the newspaper said, police will
sometimes try to persuade them not to report a difficult crime.
	   ``They even tell the victim that they will try hard to resolve
the crime only if he withdraws his report,'' said Moscow's first
deputy prosecutor, Yuri Sinelshchikov.
	   In one Russian city, Skuratov said, police kept raiding a drug
den and arresting drug users, but ignored the drug dealer running
the place. Their motive, he said, was to make lots of easy arrests,
and that depended on the dealer staying in business.
	   This is not the first time Russian officials have raised alarms
about police crime statistics. In April, one of new Sergei
Kiriyenko's first acts after being named prime minister was to
accuse police of telling ``shameless lies'' to make themselves look
good.

Man asks court to let him die
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PRIYA MALHOTRA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India(AP) _ Eighty years old and determined to die,
C.A. Thomas regularly makes the steamy, 70-kilometer (43-miles) bus
ride from his southern Indian village to a nearby town to see his
lawyer about his assisted suicide case.
	   From his village 1,900 kilometers (1,100 miles) south of New
Delhi, the retired school principal is challenging Indian law and
beliefs. He insists he should be able to choose when he dies,
though his wife Eliamma is appalled at his crusade.
	   ``I definitely do not support him here,'' she said in a
telephone interview this week, speaking in Malayalam. ``I feel he
should die according to God's will.''
	   Thomas, according to his lawyer, is healthy, financially secure
and content with his family life, but believes he has lived long
enough and does not want to wait until his health deteriorates to
die.
	   His wife described Thomas as exhausted and worried no one will
take care of him as he becomes increasingly frail.
	   Thomas was too deaf to speak to an Associated Press reporter by
telephone. He was quoted as telling a local reporter from the Times
of India: ``I must go at my will.''
	   Lawyer Vincent Panikulangara submitted a petition on Thomas's
behalf in June demanding that doctors in state hospitals across the
country help even healthy people die when they are ready, and that
the government conduct a survey to determine whether Indians want
provisions for assisted suicide.
	   Panikulangara prefers the term ``voluntary death.'' But what he
is describing is euthanasia or physician assisted death, both,
according to Kusum Kumar of the Indian Law Institute, illegal in
India. Attempted suicide is also punishable by jail terms or fines.
	   There have been unsuccessful moves in the past to legalize
medically assisted death in India, but only for terminally ill
patients.
	   '' We are not in favor of physician assisted death, since
diseases and treatments are changing so rapidly that what might
seem terminal today might not be tomorrow,'' added Dr. Prem
Aggarwal, general secretary of the Indian Medical Association.
	   H.D. Shourie, one of India's few prominent euthanasia advocates,
said Thomas has little chance of legal success. But Shourie said
the case could be useful because it raises questions about
attitudes toward death and dying.
	   Panikulangara cited Hindu texts in his court papers, saying
voluntary relinquishment of the body has been exalted for centuries
in India. Both Kulangara and Thomas are Christian, but Kulangara
says they share the cultural heritage of the majority of Indians,
who are Hindu.
	   Most Hindus believe that no one can choose his karma, or fate.
But Hindu holy men have been known to commit ritual suicide.
	   ``Many saints used to just walk into the Holy Ganges,''
Panikulangara said.

Earthquake strikes Azores Islands, killing five
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ An earthquake shook Portugal's Azores
Islands in the Atlantic Ocean just before dawn Thursday, killing at
least five people and leaving some 1,000 people homeless.
	   The quake's magnitude was 5.8 and had its epicenter at sea, 15
kilometers (10 miles) northeast of Faial island, one of the group's
nine volcanic islands, a spokesman for Portugal's National
Seismological Institute said.
	   By midday the death toll stood at five, according to Helena Vaz,
spokeswoman for the Azores Civil Protection Service.
	   Vaz said at least 40 people were injured and some 1,000 were
left homeless on Faial, an island with a population of about 5,000
and the one said to be hardest hit by the quake.
	   It was not immediately known if other islands were affected.
	   Two Portuguese Air Force Puma helicopters were being used to
take casualties to the hospital in Horta, Faial's main city.
	   An Air Force C-130 transport plane carrying emergency aid was
due to leave Lisbon at 1 p.m. (1200 GMT) for the three-hour flight
to the archipelago.
	   The plane was taking sniffer dogs, medical teams, electricity
generators, rescue experts, 2,000 blankets and 160 army tents with
capacity for about 1,000 people, Antonio Capinha, a spokesman for
the Internal Affairs Ministry said.
	   ``What they need mainly at the moment is sniffer dogs to find
people who may be buried in the rubble of their own homes,'' said
Capinha.
	   Prime Minister Antonio Guterres canceled a weekend vacation with
Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar to fly to the Azores.
	   Portuguese state television RTP showed images in the small Faial
village of Ribeirinha with families standing about in their
nightwear in the bright morning sunshine as they surveyed the
damage done to their houses and cars.
	   Residents said the quake lasted between 15 and 20 seconds and
was followed by a series of minor aftershocks.
	   The quake was felt at 5:22 a.m. (0522 GMT) on four of the
islands which lie 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) west of Portugal,
Portuguese state radio RDP reported.
	   Besides Faial, Civil Protection Services were also alerted on
the islands of Pico, Sao Jorge and Terceira, where the U.S. Air
Force has a base, RDP said.
	   Gregory Adams, a spokesman at the U.S. Embassy in Lisbon, said
there was no damage reported at the base.
	   The Azores have a total population of about 250,000, most of
whom make their living from agriculture. The islands have been hit
by earthquakes in the past, with 49 people killed and some 300
injured in one of the worst tremors in 1980.

Two grenades thrown at Cambodian justice minister's house
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with newspaper report on dispute, 5th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Two grenades were thrown at the home
of Cambodia's justice minister early Thursday, but did not explode,
police and witnesses said.
	   One Russian-made grenade was lobbed over the fence and landed in
Chem Snguon's courtyard at 8:20 a.m., according to a family member
who said that the minister was not at home at the time.
	   Police discovered the other explosive outside the compound after
they arrived at the house to investigate, said municipal police
chief Khuon Sophan, who speculated that the grenades were thrown
from a distance.
	   ``I dare not guess who was behind this,'' he said. ``We are
still investigating.''
	   The newspaper Cambodian Daily reported that Chem Snguon was in
the middle of a legal dispute between rival police units. On
several occasions, the dispute had threatened to turn violent, it
said.
	   Family members were unwilling to speculate whether there was a
political motive behind the planned attack, noting that the justice
minister has many enemies.
	   ``Of course, he is the minister of justice,'' said Chem Snguon's
son-in-law. ``So for every 50 friends he has, he also has 50
enemies.''
	   Cambodia is awash with weapons, a legacy of more than two
decades of civil war. Laws controlling unauthorized possession of
guns and grenades are rarely enforced.
	   On Monday, a grenade was thrown in a children's amusement park,
killing one person and injuring at least six others.
	   Though the blast came during the tense run-up to parliamentary
elections July 26, police said they believe the attack was not
politically motivated.

Taliban army rebuilding museum with U.N. help

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's Taliban religious army
began rebuilding its war-devastated museum Thursday with the help
of the United Nations.
	   A casualty of the protracted civil war that has destroyed entire
neighborhoods of Kabul, the museum, once an elegant dome-shaped
building that stood guard on the southeastern outskirts of the city
for 200 years, is in ruins.
	   The roof is gone, shattered by relentless rocket attacks. Inside
the building doors hang off their hinges, the floors are littered
with the debris of spent shells and charred artifacts.
	   Most of the treasures of the museum -- a fortune in Byzantine
gold coins, precious ivory pieces and Buddhist statues -- have
mostly been stolen.
	   About 30 percent of the original collection is all that is left,
Deputy Information Minister Abdul Rehman Ottaqi said during a brief
inauguration ceremony to mark the start of the reconstruction.
	   The destruction was wrought by warring Islamic groups who took
control of Kabul from the ousted communist regime in 1992. Then the
museum was untouched. It's treasures on display.
	   But marauding bands of mujahedeen or Islamic warriors swept
through the museum. The stolen artifacts were brought to
neighboring Pakistan and sold in the markets and bazaars of
Peshawar on the border with Afghanistan.
	   A non-profit group called the Society for the Preservation of
Afghan Culture was established in 1993 and included representatives
from several countries. Currently the Italian ambassador to
Pakistan heads the group, which has spent money trying to buy back
museum artifacts and return them to Afghanistan.
	   But many of Afghanistan's treasurers have left the region and
now are believed to be in the hands of collectors in several
countries, including Britain and Japan.
	   ``This is our history. This is Afghanistan's history,'' Ottaqi
said. ``This museum belongs not just to Afghanistan, but to the
world and the world should help with the reconstruction.''
	   Until 1996 when the Taliban took control of Kabul the museum was
on the front line. Rival Islamic rebels would hide their weapons
inside and scurry for cover from incoming rockets.
	   The area was heavily mined, but has since been cleared of most
of the deadly devices, said officials.
	   The Taliban army which now rules roughly 85 percent of
Afghanistan is fighting a northern-based alliance, led by former
military chief Ahmed Shah Massood, who is believed to have hidden
some of the artifacts for safekeeping in the hills that surround
the beleaguered capital.
	   The northern-based alliance controls about 15 percent of the
country.

Defense makes final arguments in extradition hearing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Sheinbein's attorney concluding final arguments,
court in recess before hearing state's brief response &QL; 
 &UR; By DANNA HARMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The lawyer for an American teen-ager wanted for
murder in Maryland on Thursday delivered six hours of closing
arguments in his client's extradition hearings.
	   The teen-ager, Samuel Sheinbein, 17, sat in court handcuffed and
shackled. When asked by a reporter during recess whether he wanted
to say something, Sheinbein laughed and shook his head.
	   Sheinbein, clean-shaven and wearing a white T-shirt and black
pants, sat close to his parents in the crowded, stuffy courtroom.
His father, Sol, squeezed the younger Sheinbein's hand from time to
time, and at one point kissed him on the head and ruffled his hair.
	   In Thursday's closed-door hearing, defense lawyer David Libai
delivered six hours of final arguments on why his client should not
be sent to Maryland to stand trial in the September dismemberment
killing of a 19-year-old acquaintance, Alfred Tello Jr.
	   After an afternoon recess, the state was given a chance to
respond briefly. The judge was not expected to rule Thursday.
	   Sheinbein fled to Israel after the killing and is claiming
Israeli citizenship in an attempt to prevent his extradition.
Israeli law bars citizens from being sent abroad to stand trial.
	   Israeli prosecutor Irit Kaan has said that allowing Sheinbein to
take refuge in Israel would be a ``cynical exploitation'' of
Israel's citizenship laws.
	   Sheinbein's lawyers argue that his father is an Israeli citizen,
and that the status was automatically passed on to him.
	   But Israel says that Sheinbein's father lost his citizenship
because he moved his family to the United States in 1950, before
the country's citizenship law went into effect.
	   Sheinbein never lived in Israel and never held an Israeli
passport.
	   Another teen-ager charged in the murder, 18-year-old Aaron
Needle, hanged himself in his Maryland cell in April.

Death toll from Central Asia flood rises to 43
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The death toll has risen to 43 from a flood that
washed over villages in the mountainous border region of Uzbekistan
and Kyrgyzstan, the Interfax news agency reported Thursday.
	   The dam broke Wednesday on the Kuban-Kel lake, which forms the
border between the two Central Asian nations. Officials reported
Wednesday that 38 people had been killed, and said Thursday that
five more victims had been found.
	   Many of the deaths were in the mountainous Kadamzhai district in
western Kyrgyzstan and the Shakhimardan district in eastern
Uzbekistan.

Right-wing party produces music video to praise nuclear tests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ A dancing Indian soldier heads home on
vacation, singing the praises of India's nuclear tests.
	   That music video image will begin appearing on Indian television
stations Friday as part of a campaign by members of the Hindu
nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party to encourage their countrymen to
take pride in the tests.
	   A song reaches out to more people than a politician's speech,
said Abhiram Singh, the video's producer and a BJP representative
in the state assembly of Western Maharashtra state. The Maharashtra
state capital of Bombay is the center of the Indian entertainment
industry.
	   Titled ``We are Indian,'' the five-minute Hindi-language video
shows women and children joining the exuberant soldier in
celebrations. The camera then turns to mountains and the rivers.
	   ``Our country will always remain safe,'' the soldier sings.
	   ``The song speaks of the whole nation being united in praise of
the tests despite India's diversity,'' Singh said.
	   Indians initially reacted with euphoria to the May underground
tests. But answering tests from neighbor and rival Pakistan and
international economic sanctions later dampened enthusiasm.
	   The BJP-led federal governing coalition said Indian needed a
deterrent in face of the nuclear threat posed by Pakistan and
China.
	   ``We will respect our friends,'' goes Singh's chorus. ``But if
the climate of enmity increases, we vow we will not be afraid.''

Bad loan ratio for Philippine banks rises to 8.79 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The ratio of Philippine commercial
banks' non-performing loans rose to 8.79 percent of total
outstanding loans at the end of April from 7.58 percent in March
and 6.74 percent in February, the central bank said Thursday.
	   The central bank attributed the rise in part to a tightening of
the definition of past-due loans to three months from six months,
which became effective in April.
	   It noted that while the ratio of non-performing loans has risen,
the financial difficulties resulting from Asia's currency turmoil
have slowed loan growth.
	   The central bank said the reserves of commercial banks for
possible loan losses totaled 41 billion pesos (dlrs 1 billion) in
April, or 2.7 percent of the total loan portfolio.
	   At least one-third of past-due loans are covered by loan-loss
provisioning.
	   The central bank said the ratio of non-performing loans in the
Philippines is better than in other members of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations.
	   At the end of June, the ratio in Thailand was 25 percent and in
Indonesia it was more than 30 percent, the central bank said.
	   The monetary authority expects the ratio of non-performing loans
in Thailand to increase further when the definition of
non-performing loans changes to three months from the present six
months.

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ An Anglican priest was sentenced
Thursday to 2 1/2 years prison after admitting having sex with
Romanian street boys. His lawyer said he would appeal.
	   Rev. Michael Taylor, 35, of Essex in southeastern England, was
not present for the sentencing. He was also ordered to pay court
costs of dlrs 90 and 340,000 lei (dlrs 40).
	   Taylor has already served 11 months in a Bucharest jail. He was
removed from his parish by the Church of England last week after he
pleaded guilty.
	   Last August, Taylor was caught by police and film cameras
wearing his underpants with a naked street boy in an apartment used
by prostitutes.
	   He initially pleaded guilty and then switched his plea to
innocent, claiming he had made a guilty plea on a bargain with
police for his release.
	   Last week, Taylor pleaded guilty of having oral sex with two
13-year-old street boys. His lawyer, Jean Talupca, said he would
appeal and that the court should have considered his client's
previous good character.
	   The maximum penalty for sex with minors of the same sex is seven
years and the minimum is two years.
	   Romania has attracted foreign pedophiles in recent years because
of thousands of street children who are prepared to have sex for
small favors and food.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Premier Romano Prodi sat down with his coalition
partners Thursday to try to heal divisions within his center-left
government.
	   Prodi called the talks after the Communist Refoundation party,
which is outside the coalition but gives Prodi a majority in the
Chamber of Deputies, refused last month to back the government on a
bill for NATO's eastward expansion. The measure passed with the
support of a centrist opposition party.
	   The Communists, led by Fausto Bertinotti, are demanding stronger
strategies to combat unemployment in exchange for continued
support.
	   However, they have said they would back Prodi in any confidence
vote, making any imminent government collapse or early elections,
unlikely.
	   ``Some steps forward have been made,'' Bertinotti said after
emerging from the talks, which are expected to continue for several
days. ``But we have yet to make a real breakthrough.''

Indian businesses welcome Senate review of sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS total import figure for Pakistan in 8th graf.
 &UR; By KRISHNAN GURUSWAMY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Indian business leaders on Thursday
welcomed a proposal by U.S. senators to exempt American farm
exports to India and Pakistan from the sanctions imposed following
their nuclear tests.
	   In Washington, a special Senate panel reviewing the U.S.
economic sanctions on India and Pakistan pressed Wednesday to lift
trade restrictions on farm products.
	   Senators Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, and Joe Biden,
a Delaware Democrat, said they would introduce legislation to allow
President Bill Clinton to waive some of the sanctions imposed
against India and Pakistan after the tested nuclear devices two
months ago. The amendments would exempt financing of agricultural
exports from the ban on loans and aid to India and Pakistan.
	   The sanctions Clinton imposed were virtually automatic under a
1994 law and can only be lifted or amended by Congress.
	   ``We welcome anything that promotes business between the two
countries,'' said Dilip Chenoy, director of the Confederation of
Indian Industries, a powerful trade body.
	   Chenoy said the proposed legislation was partly prompted by the
eagerness of American farmers to outbid Australian farmers selling
wheat to India.
	   ``Currently, the sanctions prevent American farmers from selling
wheat to India. This is a major opportunity for them,'' Chenoy
said.
	   India imported dlrs 154.3 million worth of farm produce from the
United States in 1997, about dlrs 42 million more than the previous
year, according to U.S. government figures. Pakistan imported dlrs
385 million in 1997, up dlrs 25 million from 1996.
	   In recent weeks, Sen. Richard Lugar, an Indiana Republican has
led efforts in Washington to reduce the number and severity of
economic sanctions. American businesses say the sanctions hurt U.S.
interests and end up helping competitors in other countries.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said last month that
the sanctions were ``all sticks and no carrot .... We must do
something about it because sanctions that have no flexibility, no
waiver authority, are just blunt instruments, and diplomacy
requires us to have some finesse.''
	   Last month, Senators Sam Brownback, a Kentucky Republican, and
Charles S. Robb, a Virginia Democrat, flew to New Delhi and
Islamabad to discuss the sanctions with Indian politicians.
	   ``On the issue of sanctions, I want to be clear: I reject the
use of food as a weapon in foreign policy,'' Brownback said then.
	   The U.S. joined other nations such as Japan, Britain and Germany
in condemning the nuclear tests and imposing sanctions.
	   In New Delhi, Foreign Ministry spokesman K.C. Singh refused to
comment on the proposed change, saying the situation was still
evolving.
	   India said it tested nuclear weapons because it needed a
deterrent because of the security threats it saw in Pakistan and
China. Pakistan responded with its own tests, stepping up the
region's nuclear arms race.
	   U.S. envoy Strobe Talbott and his Indian counterpart, Jaswant
Singh, meet Thursday in Frankfurt, Germany, for the second round of
talks on their nuclear differences.

Bomb blast kills two people
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ An explosive planted around a public
telephone near the main square in the northern Slovak town of
Zilina killed two people and injured two others early Thursday,
interior ministry officials said.
	   The powerful explosion instantly killed an unidentified man and
woman and critically injured another woman and left a third without
a leg, Peter Pleva a press officer at the interior ministry said.
The injured were being treated at the local hospital. No further
information on the victims was immediately available.
	   Police investigating the blast found numerous bank notes
scattered at the site, but refused to draw any conclusions as to
what caused the explosion that threw body parts as far as 70 meters
(yards) away, Pleva said.
	   More than 70 bombs, most of them planted in cars, have exploded
across Slovakia since 1995, killing at least eight people. Police
have so far arrested six people in connection to the bombings.
	   The ministry does not have clear statistics on the blasts, but
said three of those killed were involved in organized crime and two
others were policemen.
	   Robert Remias, one of the key witnesses in the kidnapping case
of the former Slovak president's son, was also murdered when his
car exploded as he drove home in April 1996. His death remains
unsolved.
	   Last week, Prosecutor General Michal Valo publicly admitted
there is vast corruption among the underpaid police, prosecutors
and judges.

In unusual case, man goes to court to die
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS attorney's name in graf 12.
 &UR; By PRIYA MALHOTRA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India(AP) _ Eighty years old and determined to die,
C.A. Thomas regularly makes the steamy, 70-kilometer (43-miles) bus
ride from his southern Indian village to a nearby town to see his
lawyer about his assisted suicide case.
	   From his obscure village 1,900 kilometers (1,100 miles) south of
New Delhi, the retired school principal is challenging Indian law
and beliefs. He insists he should be able to choose when he dies,
though his wife Eliamma is appalled at his crusade.
	   ``I definitely do not support him here,'' she said in a
telephone interview this week, speaking in Malayalam. ``I feel he
should die according to God's will.''
	   Thomas, according to his lawyer, is healthy, financially secure
and content with his family life, but believes he has lived long
enough and does not want to wait until his health deteriorates to
die.
	   His wife described Thomas as exhausted and worried no one will
take care of him as he becomes increasingly frail.
	   Thomas was too deaf to speak to an Associated Press reporter by
telephone. He was quoted as telling a local reporter from the Times
of India: ``I must go at my will.''
	   Lawyer Vincent Panikulangara submitted a petition on Thomas's
behalf in June demanding that doctors in state hospitals across the
country help even healthy people die when they are ready, and that
the government conduct a survey to determine whether Indians want
provisions for assisted suicide.
	   Panikulangara prefers the term ``voluntary death.'' But what he
is describing is euthanasia or physician assisted death, both,
according to Kusum Kumar of the Indian Law Institute, illegal in
India. Attempted suicide is also punishable by jail terms or fines.
	   There have been unsuccessful moves in the past to legalize
medically assisted death in India, but only for terminally ill
patients.
	   '' We are not in favor of physician assisted death, since
diseases and treatments are changing so rapidly that what might
seem terminal today might not be tomorrow,'' added Dr. Prem
Aggarwal, general secretary of the Indian Medical Association.
	   H.D. Shourie, one of India's few prominent euthanasia advocates,
said Thomas has little chance of legal success. But Shourie said
the case could be useful because it raises questions about
attitudes toward death and dying.
	   Panikulangara cited Hindu texts in his court papers, saying
voluntary relinquishment of the body has been exalted for centuries
in India. Both Panikulangara and Thomas are Christian, but
Panikulangara says they share the cultural heritage of the majority
of Indians, who are Hindu.
	   Most Hindus believe that no one can choose his karma, or fate.
But Hindu holy men have been known to commit ritual suicide.
	   ``Many saints used to just walk into the Holy Ganges,''
Panikulangara said.

U.S. will assess Cambodian polls independently
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The United States will issue an
independent judgment of whether Cambodia's elections are free and
fair and won't be bound by the assessment of an international group
of observers, officials said Thursday.
	   Washington has already shown indications of drawing a harder
line than other international players involved in the elections,
refusing to supply direct election aid to strongman Hun Sen's
government.
	   A U.S. Embassy official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said that 25 long-term U.S. observers will continue to participate
in the United Nations' umbrella observation group, which is
coordinating more than 500 international observers.
	   No explanation was given for the decision to craft a separate
judgment, but the United States has taken a more critical stance on
Cambodia than the European Union and some other other donor
countries since Hun Sen deposed his co-prime minister in a bloody
coup last year.
	   In an effort to win back legitimacy and aid, Hun Sen has called
for new elections July 26 and is allowing the man he ousted, Prince
Norodom Ranariddh, to participate.
	   Critics say that the process has been stacked in Hun Sen's favor
and that his Cambodian People's Party has engaged in killings and
intimidation of opposition members.
	   Before last year's coup, the United States was considering
giving Cambodia dlrs 7 million for elections, but it since has
decided to allot only dlrs 2.3 million _ none of it to any agency
linked to Hun Sen's government.
	   The European Union, which is contributing dlrs 11 million in
technical support and training for the Cambodian elections, has
been less critical about the process.

Solana visits Ukraine to mark one year of cooperation charter

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana marked
one year of NATO's partnership charter with Ukraine on Thursday,
meeting with top Ukrainian officials and praising their efforts to
work with the alliance.
	   ``It has been a very positive year,'' Solana said. ``In the
construction and structure of security on the continent, Ukraine
has continued to play a fundamental role.''
	   ``The stability, security and prosperity (in Europe) is
impossible without strong relations between Ukraine and NATO,''
Solana told reporters.
	   Ukraine signed a special cooperation charter with the U.S.-led
alliance exactly one year ago and has eagerly hosted and
participated in peacekeeping maneuvers under NATO's Partnership for
Peace program.
	   Some Ukrainian officials have said the country may eventually
seek NATO membership. The government formally says, however, that
it only wants close relations with NATO.
	   Russia, Ukraine's giant northern neighbor, has vehemently
opposed any of the former Soviet republics joining NATO.
	   The top NATO official met with Defense Minister Oleksandr
Kuzmuk, Security Council secretary Volodymyr Horbulin and other
officials, and later in the day held prolonged talks with President
Leonid Kuchma.
	   The sides discussed military, technological and scientific
cooperation as well as peacekeeping and joint work in dealing with
civil emergencies.
	   ``We shall have cooperation not only in military issues, not
only in the Partnership for Peace program but in many other''
spheres, said Kuchma, who hailed Ukraine's cooperation with NATO as
``fruitful and constructive.''
	   The sides also agreed on the appointment of a NATO liaison
officer to Ukraine, the first step toward opening a mission that
could negotiate military contacts with the former Soviet republic,
according to Ukraine's Foreign Ministry.
	   Ukrainian officials praised Solana's visit. Underlining its
importance, a full military guard greeted Solana at the ornate
Mariinsky Palace where he met with Kuchma.
	   The Foreign Ministry said Ukraine plans to focus future
cooperation with the alliance on a variety of military and
technical issues, such as joint design of weapons and military
conversion projects.
	   Ukraine also wants to cooperate with NATO in space research, it
said.
	   From Kiev, Solana was to travel later Thursday to the eastern
Ukrainian city of Dnipropetrovsk, where he would be visiting the
huge Yuzhmash rocket plant.

Suspect in Sudan bombing plot dies in custody
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ A suspect in an alleged anti-government
bombing plot has died in custody, and officials are calling it a
suicide, a daily newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The Akhabr Al_Youm quoted unidentified officials as saying that
the suspect swallowed poison pills. Guards prevented another
suspect from eating similar pills, the newspaper said.
	   It did not say when the deaths occurred or how the suspects
managed to get hold of the pills, which also were not identified.
Neither suspect was named.
	   Government officials were not immediately available for comment
and the report could not be independently confirmed.
	   On Monday, the state television showed three men with bruises on
their faces, confessing that they were among those who planted
bombs in the capital Khartoum. They said they were members of the
exiled opposition group, the National Democratic Alliance.
	   The government said the bombs were meant to target government
installations on June 30 during celebrations marking the ninth
anniversary of the 1989 military coup that brought President Omar
el-Bashir to power.
	   It said the plot was discovered after some bombs exploded
prematurely without causing injuries.
	   On Wednesday, Information Minister Ghazi Salah Eddin said Sudan
is asking the Interpol to help extradite opposition leaders in
exile whom he said were involved in the bombings. He did not
elaborate.
	   Opposition groups have accused the government of fabricating the
report about the bombings and the plot.

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ An explosion apparently caused by a gas
container ripped through the heart of Istanbul's crowded tourist
area Thursday, killing at least six people in a historic spice
market, the semi-official Anatolia news agency reported.
	   At least 91 people were injured, five seriously, Istanbul's
Chief Prosecutor Ferzan Citici told APTV. Many people were injured
in the panic that followed the blast.
	   The explosion was reportedly triggered by a faulty gas container
used for a stove at a food stand in the covered market.
	   ``It is highly unlikely that is was a bomb. We are working on
the basis that it was a gas explosion,'' Citici said.
	   But explosives experts rushed to the scene to determine whether
a bomb might have caused the explosion, said Istanbul's Police
Chief Hasan Ozdemir.
	   The market was evacuated.
	   Witnesses said the market was overcrowded at the time of the
explosion because of the heavy rain.
	   ``I heard a big bang, at first I thought it was lightning. Then
I realized it was an explosion,'' shopowner Unal Akkaya told APTV.
``I ran to the scene, there were bodies lying on the ground and
injured people scattering around. The place is totally destroyed.''
	   Television footage showed the injured being sent to the hospital
in taxis. The identities or nationalities of the victims were not
available.
	   The 17th century spice market, known in Turkey as the Egyptian
market, is situated near the Blue Mosque and Istanbul's renowned
Covered Bazaar. The covered market offers exotic food, spices and
dried fruits in hundreds of stands.
	   The market overlooks The Golden Horn, an inlet of the Marmara
Sea.

Big Puerto Rican strike begins with bang, fizzles down to scuffles

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Police arrested five people
planting homemade bombs at dawn Thursday at the headquarters of the
Puerto Rico Telephone Co., whose controversial sale prompted the
biggest protest in the U.S. territory's history.
	   Five adults and two 15-year-olds were found planting five bombs
made of acid, metal, keys and shards of glass at the company's
suburban Guaynabo offices, police Col. Adalberto Mercado said. The
bomb squad had to detonate one of the bombs in an abandoned house,
he said.
	   The police, who suspect a clandestine pro-independence guerrilla
group in previous bomb plantings, did not identify those arrested.
	   The attempted attack came hours after union leaders ended a
48-hour general strike that started with a dramatic blockade of the
main airport, a bomb and the strafing of a bank.
	   Then it fizzled to picket line scuffles with police and an ax
attack on a telephone pole.
	   The strike united Puerto Ricans like few other issues in a
century of U.S. rule, union leaders and opposition politicians
said.
	   It ended Wednesday night in a rhetoric of rallies by
``independentistas,'' whose stand is supported by fewer than 8
percent of Puerto Ricans, according to a recent poll.
	   A Newspaper Guild official recited a poem urging islanders ``to
resist those from abroad,'' at the biggest rally in San Juan.
	   It featured a speech by Lolita Lebron, the unrepentant militant
who led a 1954 armed attack on the U.S. House of Representatives
that wounded five lawmakers.
	   On Thursday, labor leaders will discuss ending the
three-week-old walkout by the telephone company's 6,400 workers,
which inspired the massive strike.
	   They are considering a change of tactics, including periodic
one-day walkouts, said Annie Cruz, leader of the Independent
Brotherhood of Telephone Employees.
	   ``We won't go (back to work). Not after what happened here,''
said Aida L. Rivera Marrero, a union delegate in an office park
where riot police clubbed protesters three weeks ago.
	   The strikers failed to move Gov. Pedro Rossello, whom they want
to hold a referendum on the dlrs 1.9 billion sale of Puerto Rico
Telephone Co. to a consortium led by GTE Corp. of Stamford,
Connecticut.
	   Rossello said the only referendum would be one on the status of
the island, which already has been approved by the U.S. House of
Representatives and awaits the vote of the Senate.
	   Union leaders accuse the governor of ``selling the national
patrimony'' in his campaign to make the island the 51st state of
the union. Statehood supporters say the strike is aimed at
presenting Puerto Rico as an unstable and unfriendly prospect for
the union and dissuading foreign investment in Rossello's ambitious
privatization plans.
	   Rossello has said that state companies cannot compete in a newly
deregulated world. The telephone company slashed rates last year.
But a call to California still costs about a third what it costs to
call across the island (34 cents a minute).
	   Union leaders said 200,000 government employees stayed away from
work, along with another 300,000 islanders. But the government said
80 percent of its 300,000 employees worked through the strike.
	   Major shopping malls closed because of a rash of bomb threats.
Buses and taxis stayed off the roads, and small commuter airlines
and cargo companies were grounded at regional airports.
	   On Tuesday, hundreds of strikers blocked the freeway entrance to
San Juan's main international airport, forcing some tourists loaded
with baggage to walk more than a mile to the terminal.

Finance minister to seeks funds abroad for bad debt cleanup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's finance minister will
travel to the United States and Europe at the end of July to raise
funds for a new agency trying to clean up banks' bad loans, a
Finance Ministry official said Thursday.
	   Anwar Ibrahim will spend a week raising funds in London, Zurich,
Washington and New York, the official said.
	   The money would go for a dlrs 1 billion to dlrs 2 billion
sovereign bond issue to fund the Asset Management Company,
Malaysia's newly established bad-debt agency.
	   The AMC was created in May to take over bad loans and, in some
cases, the management of companies involved, freeing banks to
concentrate on lending.
	   Commercial banks, burdened with bad debt from the economic
downturn, have cut back on lending in recent months, fearing that
loans would not be repaid.
	   The estimated amount needed for the bad-debt agency is 25
billion ringgit (dlrs 6.1 billion). The initial sovereign bond
issue would take place by next month with J.P. Morgan and Arthur
Anderson and Co. acting as financial advisers.
	   Newly appointed Special Functions Minister Daim Zainuddin, in
charge of economic recovery, will be leading another team abroad,
the Finance Ministry official said. Daim's office, however, said it
would be ``improper to make a statement at this time'' ahead of the
official announcement.
	   Daim's recent appointment by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad was
seen as a political shove to Anwar, whose tight monetary policies
have failed to revive Malaysia's economy and conflicted with
Mahathir's proposals for more lenient policies.
	   Daim and Anwar are due to meet in New York, the official added.
	   Anwar will also be going to Washington next weekend in his
capacity as chairman of the joint ministerial development committee
at the World Bank, the official said.

World Cup: Vogts to stay on, soccer chief confirms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Berti Vogts will stay on as national team coach
despite Germany's ouster in the World Cup quarterfinals by Croatia,
German soccer federation President Egidius Braun said Thursday.
	   Braun and Vogts talked by telephone and agreed that Vogts will
remain in his post.
	   ``He told me that he will continue to follow the goal of
building a strong national team,'' Braun said.
	   ``He will develop a concept, which will be discussed in the
coming weeks'' by top federation officials, Braun said.
	   Braun said he fully supported Vogts, who had also offered to
resign in 1994, when Germany lost to Bulgaria in the quarterfinals
at the World Cup in the United States.
	   ``As president, I carry responsibility. I am fully convinced
that he is the right man and I have to give him the possibility to
fulfill his job. He had my full support,'' Braun said.
	   ``I am impressed by his creativity. There isn't another man who
has such a comprehensive overview of the German soccer,'' he said.
	   Vogts has been under fire from the German media since Germany's
elimination.
	   His conservative tactics and choice of players have been blamed
for Germany's dismal performance and bland style of play.
	   ``Berti, have you seen this?,'' the banner headline in Thursday
mass-circulation Bild newspaper asked the coach. The paper referred
to the semifinal game between Brazil and the Netherlands and said
it offered everything soccer had to give, as opposed to Germany's
pale game.
	   Bild has also installed reader phone-in lines, and the calls
have been overwhelming against Vogts, with 75 percent of callers
saying he should resign.
	   Vogts, 51, took over the team in 1990. He won the European title
in 1996, but his two World Cup trips have ended in the
quarterfinals. Germany, a three-time World Cup champion, had never
before lost two quarterfinals in a row.
	   The coach has said he will reshuffle the team, bring in younger
players and put pressure on Bundesliga clubs to give playing time
to young German talents, who are now often languishing on the bench
because of the high number of foreigners.
	   Braun said Vogts and other officials will sit down together to
discuss what went wrong.
	   ``It must be possible to find 30 excellent soccer players among
80 million people,'' Braun said.

Suspect in Sudan bombing plot dies in custody

 &UR; Eds: FIXES typo in spelling of newspaper name, graf 2; no pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ A suspect in an alleged anti-government
bombing plot has died in custody, and officials are calling it a
suicide, a daily newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The Akhbar Al_Youm quoted unidentified officials as saying that
the suspect swallowed poison pills. Guards prevented another
suspect from eating similar pills, the newspaper said.
	   It did not say when the deaths occurred or how the suspects
managed to get hold of the pills, which also were not identified.
Neither suspect was named.
	   Government officials were not immediately available for comment
and the report could not be independently confirmed.
	   On Monday, the state television showed three men with bruises on
their faces, confessing that they were among those who planted
bombs in the capital Khartoum. They said they were members of the
exiled opposition group, the National Democratic Alliance.
	   The government said the bombs were meant to target government
installations on June 30 during celebrations marking the ninth
anniversary of the 1989 military coup that brought President Omar
el-Bashir to power.
	   The government said the plot was discovered after some bombs
exploded prematurely without causing injuries.
	   On Wednesday, Information Minister Ghazi Salah Eddin said Sudan
is asking the Interpol to help extradite opposition leaders in
exile whom he said were involved in the bombings. He did not
elaborate.
	   Opposition groups have accused the government of fabricating the
report about the bombings and the plot.

No solution after meeting with Blair
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with more comment from Orange Order, Martin
McGuinness, new police figues on violence; edits throughout
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Leaders of the Orange Order met
with Prime Minister Tony Blair Thursday but found no solution to a
showdown over a blocked march which has triggered five nights of
violence in Northern Ireland.
	   Some Orange leaders condemned the continuing attacks on police
officers and Catholic homes, but they continued to refuse to meet
with the leader of their Catholic opponents on the Garvaghy Road in
Portadown.
	   Northern Ireland's Parades Commission barred some 1,400
Orangemen from Portadown from following their traditional route
down the Garvaghy Road, now a Catholic area, and police and
soldiers stopped the march at the rural Drumcree church on Sunday.
	   Police fired plastic bullets overnight to repel a group of march
supporters who felled trees to improvise a bridge over a line of
barbed wire blocking the marchers. No injuries were reported.
	   Blair's spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
meeting with four Orange leaders was constructive, but said the
prime minister was ``not in a position to reverse the decision of
the Parades Commission.''
	   The Portadown march had been expected to be the first severe
test of the new spirit of compromise in Northern Ireland, where
more than 70 percent of the voters last month endorsed a new form
of local government in which Catholics and Protestants would share
power.
	   Earlier Thursday, David McNarry, a member of the Orange Order's
strategy committee, said Protestant unionists could, ``if we wish,
put our minds to paralyze this country in a matter of hours.''
	   The delegation which met Blair in London took a more
conciliatory line.
	   ``Who gains from that?'' said Rev. William Bingham, a chaplain
to the order. ``We love our country - we are not in the business of
bringing our country to rack and ruin.''
	   Martin McGuinness, a leader of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party,
met with Garvaghy Road residents Thursday morning and said they
were determined to resist the march.
	   ``It's time for the Orange Order, for unionism, to waken up,''
McGuinness said. ``The reality is that the people that we represent
are no longer going to be second-class citizens in their own
country.''
	   Orangemen have refused to meet the leader of the Garvaghy Road
protesters, Brendan MacCionnaith, who served a prison term for
Irish Republican Army offenses. Police and soldiers forced the
march through protesters in the past three years, though in 1996
they stopped the march for four days before relenting in the face
of spreading Protestant violence.
	   Overnight, police and soldiers were the target of gunfire and
bombs at Newtownabbey, 5 miles (8 kms) north of Belfast, and in
Portadown, and stolen vehicles were set afire. Six men were
arrested, but police said it was the quietest night since Sunday.
	   At midday Thursday, the Royal Ulster Constabulary said there had
been 64 attacks on police officers and 50 officers injured since
Sunday. There had been 125 arrests, and more than 500 gasoline bomb
attacks. Upwards of 8,000 Orange marchers and supporters were
massed near the church Wednesday night.
	   Security forces expect tension to increase amid Protestant
celebrations of the 12th of July, the anniversary of the Protestant
King William's victory over the Catholic King James II at the
Battle of the Boyne in 1690.
	   Across the province, members of the Orange Order will march on
Monday march with fife and drum _ marches which many Catholics
regard as swaggering demonstrations of Protestant dominance.

Asian markets end mixed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Bangkok stock exchange closed due to public holiday

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian markets ended mixed Thursday as investors
sought a better grip on the volatile economic and currency
situation in Japan.
	   The Tokyo stock market closed lower, as investors grew
disappointed over a lack of details about permanent tax cuts from
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto. A weaker yen may also have
contributed to the fall, analysts said.
	   The Nikkei average of 225 selected issues was down 84.02 points
at 16,446.95.
	   In currency trading, the dollar was trading around 140.35 yen in
Tokyo late Thursday, up from 139.43 yen in New York late Wednesday
and 138.46 yen in Tokyo late Wednesday.
	   The stock market was lower throughout the day despite
Hashimoto's vow Wednesday evening that the government will
permanently tax cuts in 1999, which may boost Japan's failing
consumption.
	   Traders said they wanted more details about the nature of the
tax cuts, such as how big they would be and which taxes would be
affected.
	   The market needs something ``to get its teeth into,'' said
Stephen Wood, a senior salesman in the foreign institutional sales
department at ING Baring Securities in Tokyo.
	   Wood said that among the things the market is looking for is a
reduction in the top income tax rates for both individuals and
corporations.
	   In Seoul, share prices closed slightly higher on hopes that
recent falling local interest rates will draw investors to the
stock market instead of the bond market.
	   The Composite Index closed at 319.73, up 0.23 from Wednesday's
318.79.
	   Analysts said the index gave up much of its gains early Thursday
on uncertainty over which companies will be deemed non-viable by
the government in the near future.
	   Elsewhere:
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices ended moderately higher,
extending a series of gains to 10 consecutive sessions, led once
again by quality shares. The All Ordinaries Index closed at
2,788.9, up 14.8 points from Wednesday's close at 2,774.1.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand shares closed higher, building on
previous gains. The NZSE-40 capital index closed at 2,095.62, up
6.63 points from Wednesday's close of 2,088.99.
	   TAIPEI: Shares ended higher at a new six-week high as investors
were encouraged by record June sales from several Taiwan technology
companies and a stronger Nasdaq Composite Index. The Weighted Price
Index was up 10.71 points, or 0.13 percent, ending at 7,947.53
points, the highest finish since May 28.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares closed lower, hounded by profit-taking
as the market grappled for a better handle on the developments in
Japan and prospects of higher interest rates. The PSE-30 index was
down 29.10 points, or 1.6 percent, closing at 1,828.40.
	   JAKARTA: Indonesian shares closed lower as investors cashed in
on profits for the second day in a row. The JSX index was down
2.659 points, closing at 470.321.
	   SINGAPORE: Shares closed mostly lower as a Japanese announcement
of permanent tax cuts failed to spur buying interest. The Straits
Times Industrial Index Thursday closed 4.13 points lower at
1,103.65.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Shares finished broadly lower on concerns over a
sharp decline in the Malaysian currency. The benchmark Composite
Index which tracks 100 blue-chip stocks was down 7.39 points, or
1.62 percent, at 447.89 points.
	   HONG KONG: Hong Kong stocks closed lower, despite news that the
territory's quasi-central bank had recently repatriated US dlrs 1
billion into the territory's banking system to relieve the tight
liquidity condition. The benchmark Hang Seng Index was down 195.40
or 2.3 percent, ending at 8,433.78.

Yeltsin spokesman praises Clinton for dropping objections to visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A presidential spokesman praised U.S. President
Bill Clinton on Thursday for deciding to visit Moscow this fall
regardless of whether Russia ratifies the START II nuclear arms
treaty.
	   Clinton's earlier efforts to tie his visit to START II
ratification was ``counterproductive,'' said Sergei Yastrzhembsky,
the spokesman for Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
	   Clinton said Monday that he would come to Moscow in September
for meetings with Yeltsin _ the first full-scale summit between the
two leaders since March 1997.
	   He had earlier said he probably wouldn't come until the Russian
Duma, the lower house of parliament, had ratified START II.
	   The treaty, which has already been approved by the U.S. Senate,
has faced strong opposition and repeated delays in the Duma, which
now is expected to vote on the issue sometime this fall. It would
cut Russian and American nuclear arsenals roughly in half.

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on Jordan, Kuwait, Egypt &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Share prices and turnover shored up on the
Amman stock exchange this week because foreign investors traded
actively with shares of lucrative commercial banks, brokers said
Thursday.
	   A stock market report said the 60-company general share index
nudged up by 1.02 percent to 174.93 points. The report reflected
activity in five days ending Wednesday with a day off Monday
marking the birthday of the seventh century Prophet Mohammed of
Islam.
	   Shares of commercial banks increased by 3.57 percent. But those
of industrial firms dropped by 4.18 percent, insurance companies by
0.79 percent and the services sector by 0.40 percent, the report
said.
	   It said turnover also increased by 25.2 percent to 5.72 million
Jordanian dinars (dlrs 8 million), of which 47.6 percent was
trading in shares of commercial banks.
	   Stocks of 97 firms were traded during the week.
 &UR; ___
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The price index of the Kuwait Stock Exchange
continued an alarming slide this week, closing at 2,028.2 points
and losing 66.3 points or 3.17 percent from last week, the National
Investments Co. said Thursday.
	   ``The question now is not whether the market will continue to
slip, but to which levels, and whether it will approach the 1,800
point barrier,'' the company said in a weekly report.
	   The exchange has been bogged down by low oil prices, political
tensions between parliament and the government, and promised
economic reform measures that have yet to materialize.
	   Some 108.74 million shares were traded this week, 50.95 million
shares, or 31.9 percent, lower than the previous week. The value of
these shares also fell 14.3 million dinars (dlrs 46.73 million), or
34.65 percent, to 26.97 million dinars (dlrs 88.13 million). The
exchange was closed Monday for a Muslim holiday.
	   Of the 75 companies listed on the exchange, four closed higher,
33 closed lower, and 21 companies were unchanged. The report said
the rest of the companies were not traded, and one, the
Bahrain-based Arab Banking Corp. was delisted as of July 1. It did
not say why.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ President Hosni Mubarak inaugurated Thursday
a 14.5-kilometer (9-mile) long elevated expressway linking central
Cairo with a national highway.
	   The expressway connects the Mohandeseen neighborhood in central
Cairo to a desert highway, which runs up to the northern port city
of Alexandria via the industrial cities of Sixth of October, Sadat
and Sheik Zayed.
	   Officials say the expressway will help ease traffic jams in this
sprawling city of about 15 million people, especially on the road
to the Pyramids of Giza which is being used at present to reach the
national highway.
	   The expressway, which is 34 meters (112 feet) wide and has three
lanes on each side, was built in six months by 12,000 workers at a
cost of 320 million pounds (dlrs 94 million), the minister of
housing and new communities, Mohammed Ibrahim Suleiman, said.
	   The expressway is part of a giant project that will link all
major streets in Cairo without going through the center of the
city.

EU pursues legal action against France, Italy over women's rights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission said Thursday
it was pursuing legal action against France and Italy, claiming
their bans on women working at night infringe EU equal rights laws.
	   The bans led to the European Court of Justice condemning both
countries last year, but they have still failed to alter national
laws that prohibit night work for women, the Commission said in a
statement.
	   The European Union executive body said it would give France two
months to make the necessary changes or it would ask the EU high
court to impose fines. It said it would take similar steps against
Italy if it failed to act.
	   Greece and Luxembourg could also face fines for failing to adopt
EU laws granting access for citizens from all 15 EU nations to jobs
in the public service.

Floods kill 170 in southwest China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Floods caused by torrential rains have killed 170
people and injured more than 1,750 others in southwest China's
Sichuan province, state media said Thursday.
	   The downpours began June 27, with six counties receiving between
20 and 50 centimeters (8 and 20 inches) of rain, the Xinhua News
Agency said.
	   Aside from the dead and injured, another 12 people were missing.
The flooding toppled about 60,000 houses, paralyzed roads and
public utilities in many areas and destroyed 58,000 hectares
(143,260 acres) of crops, Xinhua said.
	   Total property losses were estimated at 2.5 billion yuan (dlrs
300 million).
	   More heavy rains are expected in the next few weeks, it said.

Russia considering reaction to South Korea's expulsion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian Foreign Ministry was weighing Thursday
whether to respond in kind to South Korea's expulsion of a Russian
diplomat after one of its envoys was expelled on spying charges,
officials said.
	   ``The Korean side has chosen to further exacerbate the
situation, and now it's our turn to make a move,'' said ministry
spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin.
	   He added that Moscow is also considering whether to accept South
Korea's proposal to hold a meeting between both nations' foreign
ministers to discuss the crisis.
	   The spy scandal started last Friday, when Russia's Federal
Security Service detained Cho Sung-woo, a political officer at
South Korean embassy, as he met with an alleged Russian contact.
Cho was declared persona non grata and ordered to leave Russia.
	   Moscow insisted Cho was caught red-handed and warned Seoul
against any attempt to retaliate, but South Korea responded in
kind, ordering the expulsion of a Russian diplomat Wednesday.
	   ``The Korean authorities' actions are a serious escalation,''
Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin said on Thursday,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   ``We attach great importance to relations with the Republic of
Korea,'' he said. ``However, the decision to expel a Russian
diplomat wasn't provoked by anything, and, of course, aroused a
negative reaction in Moscow.''
	   Officials have identified Cho's contact as Valentin Moiseyev, a
top official in the Foreign Ministry's Asian department. He is in
custody and is expected to be charged with high treason.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Close to 800 houses were flooded in western
Ukraine as a result of heavy rains in recent days, officials said
Thursday.
	   All water reservoirs in the Zakarpatsky region were overflowing,

	   Some 400 houses were flooded in the city of Berehovo, about 320
in the village of Zarichya, and about 60 in other locations, it
said.
	   Last month, heavy rainstorms flooded nearly 200 settlements in
western Ukraine, damaging more than 5,600 houses and large
agricultural areas.

injured by rock collapse at a mine in eastern Ukraine, officials
said Thursday.
	   The accident occurred Wednesday in the town of Kryvyi Rih, said
the Emergency Situations Ministry.
	   The death brought to 220 the number of Ukrainian mine workers
killed on the job this year, according to figures from the State
Committee for Work Safety.
	   The committee blames the high number of deaths on neglect of
safety rules and outdated equipment.

Judge: Tehran mayor's work to have impact on verdict
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Mohseni correct on 2nd reference to judge &QL; 
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A judge hearing the corruption trial of
Tehran's reformist mayor said Thursday that his verdict will take
into account Gholamhossein Karbaschi's efforts to improve the
capital.
	   The judge, Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejaei, who also acts as the
prosecutor in keeping with Iranian laws, made the assurance after
wrapping up the government's case at the end of a four-hour
session.
	   The mayor, who has pleaded innocent to the charges of corruption
and embezzlement, was to begin his defense Saturday.
	   Karbaschi's trial is widely seen as an attempt by hard-liners in
the ruling clergy to topple key officials allied with moderate
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami.
	   Defense lawyer Masoud Haeri accused the court of failing to
recognize Karbaschi's accomplishments during the past eight years,
including the construction of 500 parks and numerous highways.
	   Judge Mohseni interrupted to warn Haeri that he was close to
committing contempt of court.
	   ``If you don't respect the court's reputation, I will order that
you be expelled. What you are saying is an insult to the court,''
Mohseni said.
	   Later, however, he told reporters that Karbaschi's deeds will be
considered: ``His services and achievements will have an impact on
the verdict.''
	   In past sessions, Karbaschi had sparred with the judge and
accused authorities of torturing senior municipality officials in a
bid to make them testify against him. Thursday, the mayor appeared
relaxed and composed, speaking only occasionally.
	   Mohseni said the verdict will be issued in the next two weeks.
	   If convicted, Karbaschi faces up to 10 years in jail, a fine and
a ban from holding public office.

	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings
was accorded a full ceremonial welcome Thursday in the capital,
where he reviewed an honor guard and was given a 21-gun salute.
	   The Ghanaian president was to attend a business forum in
Johannesburg on Friday then travel to Cape Town on Saturday for a
visit to Robben Island, where Mandela was imprisoned for fighting
apartheid, before returning home on Sunday.
	   An 8-year-old boy got to share the spotlight.
	   After Rawlings inspected the guard of honor, Mandela noticed
Lukas Beukes, standing next to his father, police sergeant Michael
Beukes, and called him forward. Mandela and Rawlings shook hands
with the boy before going inside for talks and to witness the
signing of a bilateral agreement on the promotion and protection of
investments.

	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ Zambia's principal opposition grouping,
the United National Independence Party, has deferred a decision on
the retirement of ex-president Kenneth Kaunda as its leader.
	   ``My intention is to retire from active politics and I handed in
my resignation letter to the Central Committee,'' Kandau, 74, told
a press conference after three days of deliberations by the
committee end Thursday.
	   He said the retirement issue was referred to the National
Council, the party's supreme organ.
	   Kaunda, arrested on Christmas Day on allegations of plotting a
coup against the rule of President Frederick Chiluba, was released
from house arrest last month when all charges were dropped.
	   He ruled Zambia from 1964 independence to the country's first
multi-party elections in 1991 but boycotted 1996 general and
presidential elections to protest alleged unfairness.
	   Kaunda announced UNIP, which held 26 out of 150 Parliament seats
in the 1991-96 national legislature, would re-enter politics by
contesting forthcoming local government elections. He demanded
appointment of a new electoral supervisory commission, claiming the
existing one was dominated by members of Chiluba's ruling Movement
for Multi-Party Democracy.

	   BUSHBUCKRIDGE, South Africa (AP) _ The death toll from a bridge
collapse climbed to 14 after a 27-year-old engineer died of her
injuries.
	   Marilee Gouws sustained serious head injuries when the bridge
under construction over the Marite River collapsed Monday near
Bushbuckridge in Northern Province.
	   Gouws was declared brain dead Wednesday and her family donated
her organs for transplant. Her heart was flown to Cape Town and
transplanted into a woman in her 50s. Gouws' kidneys were also
donated, but details weren't available.
	   ------
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The U.N. environment agency on Thursday
unveiled the first volume of an Eastern Africa atlas of coastal
resources, part of a project that aims to map Africa's Indian Ocean
coast from Somalia to Mozambique.
	   It also will map coastal resources of the Seychelles and Comoros
archipelagos.
	   Volume I on the Kenyan coast includes five maps and a book.
	   The atlas project is part of a dlrs 1.65 million project on the
Eastern Africa coastal and marine environment database project
funded by Belgium.
	   ------
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ A three day forum on conflict
prevention in the region has begun in Burkina Faso's capital of
Ouagadougou.
	   The meeting, organized by the 16-member regional grouping known
as the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), opened
Wednesday.
	   Attending the forum were diplomats, military experts, government
officials, including ECOWAS Executive Secretary Lansana Kouyate,
who addressed the opening ceremony.
	   ``Most of the conflicts today in the sub-region result from
internal contradictions,'' he said. ``Prevention is not only to
foresee, but to sort the trouble out.''
	   The three-day forum ends Friday.
	   ------
	   ACCRA, Ghana (AP) _ The eighth meeting of the Ghana-Burkina Faso
Permanent Joint Commission for Cooperation has ended in Accra with
a call for stronger ties between the two neighbors.
	   In addition to calling for new trade and transport links, the
two countries signed agreements to increase cooperation in the
field of energy.
	   The meeting ended Wednesday.
	   ------
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Christians have no basis for supporting
gays and lesbians, the president of the Zimbabwe Council of
Churches told the organization's annual meeting Wednesday.
	   The Rev. Enos Chomutiri echoed the words of President Robert
Mugabe when he said Christian scriptures viewed gay and lesbian
relationships as a violation of God's ordinances. In repeated
attacks not only on homosexuals but on those defending homosexuals'
rights to associate and express themselves, Mugabe has said gays
and lesbians were ``lower than pigs or dogs'' and ``had no rights
at all.''
	   The issue of homosexuality, and presence of a gay rights
observer group, may split a planned meeting here later this year of
the World Council of Churches.

Palestinian negotiators leave for Washington to meet with Albright
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu meeting opposition leader.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian negotiators, who have been summoned
to Washington by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, will
not accept changes in a U.S. proposal for an Israeli troop pullback
in the West Bank, a Palestinian Cabinet minister said Thursday.
	   The negotiators, Nabil Shaath and Saeb Erekat, left for the
United States early Thursday, following a phone call between
Albright and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   ``There are certain issues she (Albright) wants to present to
the Palestinian side,'' said Hanan Ashrawi, Palestinian minister of
higher education.
	   The Palestinian envoys will listen, but ``will not renegotiate
the (U.S.) initiative,'' Ashrawi told a news conference.
	   Israel has demanded that the United States make changes in the
plan which calls for a gradual Israeli pullback from 13 percent of
the West Bank, accompanied by Palestinian security measures.
	   Israel reportedly is ready to hand over 10 percent in full, but
wants to retain control over zoning and planning in the remaining 3
percent.
	   Israel also demands that the Palestinian Authority extradite
suspects in the killings of Israelis and that the Palestine
National Council, rather than the smaller PLO Executive Committee,
annul sections of the PLO Covenant calling for Israel's
destruction.
	   The U.S. initiative does not call for the extradition of wanted
men and is satisfied with a vote on the covenant by the PLO
Executive Committee.
	   Israel radio said Thursday that Washington has agreed only to
cosmetic changes in the original initiative which was accepted by
the Palestinians several weeks ago.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday it was
up to the Palestinians to achieve a breakthrough. The Palestinians
should carry out their commitments, such as confiscating illegal
weapons and reducing the size of their police force, he said.
	   Later on Thursday, Netanyahu met for two hours with Israeli
opposition leader Ehud Barak to brief him on the contacts with the
Americans. Israel army radio quoted Barak as saying that he
believed some progress had been made since he last met with
Netanyahu a month ago.
	   The Palestinians have accused Netanyahu of playing for time in
hopes of eventually wriggling out of his commitment to hand over
more land. ``The peace process is not only in a state of deadlock.
We feel that it has been destroyed by Netanyahu,'' Ashrawi said.
	   In other developments Thursday, Israeli troops imposed a curfew
on parts of downtown Hebron after shots were fired at a car driven
by Jewish settlers.
	   Some 450 Jewish settlers and 130,000 Palestinians live in
Hebron. The downtown area is patrolled by Israeli troops while 80
percent of the city are under Palestinian Authority control.

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch officials have asked
authorities in Trinidad and Tobago to arrest and extradite
Suriname's former dictator Desi Bouterse, who is reportedly
visiting the Caribbean country, an official said Thursday.
	   Prosecutors in The Hague have charged Bouterse with cocaine
smuggling, claiming he transported hundreds of kilograms (pounds)
of cocaine to Europe, said Elizabeth Horstink, a spokeswoman for
the prosecutor's office.
	   Bouterse has denied the charges, and Suriname refuses to
extradite him to the Netherlands for trial.
	   ``We've received information that he is traveling around,''
Horstink said.
	   She added that Interpol issued a warrant for Bouterse's arrest
in August 1997, and the request sent to authorities in Trinidad and
Tobago this week was ``a logical next step.''

<SLUG> Real Madrid coach resigns after month on job </SLUG>


<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Real Madrid's coach Jose Antonio Camacho
tendered his resignation on Thursday after less than a month on the
job, news reports said.
	   Club chariman Lorenzo Sanz has apparently accepted the former
Real Madrid player's resignation, Camacho's agent Angel Castillo
told the national news agency EFE.
	   Camacho, 43, was hired on June 17 with a two-year contract. He
took over from German Jupp Heynckes, who was fired despite having
guided the club to a record seventh European Champions title.
	   Camacho was to hold a press conference later Thursday to explain
his decision.
	   	   A regular on Madrid's first team between 1974 and 1989, Camacho
was the team's third coach in three seasons. As a player with
Madrid, he won six championships and two UEFA Cup trophies.
	   After retiring as a player in 1989, Camacho coached the
first-division teams Espanyol and Sevilla.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli judge said Thursday he will rule by
September 1 on whether an American teen-ager wanted for murder in
Maryland can be extradited to the United States.
	   Samuel Sheinbein's lawyer delivered six hours of closing
arguments in the closed door hearing on Thursday to wrap up months
of testimony. Sheinbein, 17, sat in court handcuffed and shackled.
When asked by a reporter during recess whether he wanted to say
something, Sheinbein laughed and shook his head.
	   Sheinbein, clean-shaven and wearing a white T-shirt and black
pants, sat close to his parents in the crowded, stuffy courtroom.
His father, Sol, squeezed the younger Sheinbein's hand from time to
time, and at one point kissed him on the head and ruffled his hair.
	   His mother left the hearings weeping, and declined to speak to
reporters.
	   Defense lawyer David Libai delivered six hours of final
arguments on why his client should not be sent to Maryland to stand
trial in the September dismemberment killing of a 19-year-old
acquaintance, Alfred Tello Jr.

Minister: Hanson's comments costly to Australia's education
</HEADLINE>
industry &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ In a veiled attack on right-wing
populist Pauline Hanson's One Nation party, a Queensland state
minister said Thursday that ``loose-tongued politicians'' were
damaging Australia's valuable international education industry.
	   Queensland Education Minister Dean Wells said that at a recent
information day for Hong Kong students considering attending
university in Australia, 20 percent of 1,100 students specifically
asked not to receive information on Queensland.
	   The figures were passed on by education marketing body EDP
Education Australia, host for the information day, Wells said.
	   One Nation, in its first test at the ballot box since its
creation about 18 months ago, attracted about 23 percent of the
vote at a June 13 Queensland election, winning 11 seats _ but no
power in government _ in the state's Parliament.
	   Hanson claims Australia is becoming ``Asianized'' and wants to
severely cut immigration and subject applicants to an
English-language test.
	   Wells said international students injected U.S. dlrs 5.6 million
(9 million Australian dollars) a week into the Queensland economy,
or about U.S. dlrs 310 million (500 million Australian dollars) a
year.
	   ``The loose talk going around pushed by careless politicians who
are letting their mouths run ahead of their brains is going to cost
Australia _ and in particular Queensland _ a fortune if we cannot
turn this around,'' Wells said.
	   The government supported a campaign by nine Queensland
universities aimed at informing Asian students that Queensland has
strong anti-discrimination laws.
	   ``It's important to get the true picture out there into Asian
countries,'' Wells said.
	   ``It is important that overseas students understand the true
nature of Queensland people and the fears and misrepresentations
they may have heard.''

Howe given 22-match ban over positive tests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian rugby league test forward
Rodney Howe was banned Thursday for 22 matches after returning
positive tests to two banned substances.
	   Melbourne's Howe, 25, became the third Australian first grade
player in the past fortnight to receive the maximum ban, following
Newcastle players Wayne Richards and Robbie O'Davis.
	   Howe admitted he injected steroid stanozolol, the drug made
famous by Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson at the Seoul Olympics, to
aid recovery from a knee reconstruction.
	   Few details of the four-hour hearing were available Thursday
night but the tribunal of Sir Laurence Street, Dr. George Peponis
and Michael Cleary heard Howe had also taken the steroid andriol in
tablet form. Howe was too distressed to talk to the media after the
hearing but his club boss, John Ribot, said Melbourne would support
him.
	   A fourth player, Newcastle's Adam MacDougall, has also returned
a positive A sample and will face the tribunal if his B sample is
also positive.
	   The results of three more clubs involved in the first round of
blanket-testing were released Thursday, with all players from
Canberra, Manly and Penrith cleared after giving samples on June
21.
	   Newcastle players tested that day following the match against
Canberra were also cleared.
	   National Rugby League chief Neil Whittaker admitted he expected
more positive tests.
	   ``We know these four positive results may be the first of more
positive samples expected over the next few weeks,'' Whittaker
said. ``So it is armed with the knowledge that there could be more
players to face the tribunal that we must confront and exorcise our
demons.''

 &UR; Real Madrid coach resigns after month on job &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Real Madrid's coach Jose Antonio Camacho
tendered his resignation on Thursday after less than a month on the
job, news reports said.
	   Club chariman Lorenzo Sanz has apparently accepted the former
Real Madrid player's resignation, Camacho's agent Angel Castillo
told the national news agency EFE.
	   Camacho, 43, was hired on June 17 with a two-year contract. He
took over from German Jupp Heynckes, who was fired despite having
guided the club to a record seventh European Champions title.
	   Camacho was to hold a press conference later Thursday to explain
his decision.
	   	   A regular on Madrid's first team between 1974 and 1989, Camacho
was the team's third coach in three seasons. As a player with
Madrid, he won six championships and two UEFA Cup trophies.
	   After retiring as a player in 1989, Camacho coached the
first-division teams Espanyol and Sevilla.

US delegation pledges to rebuild area of cable car tragedy

<TEXT>
	   CAVALESE, Italy (AP) _ A U.S. delegation on Thursday pledged to
help restore tourism in the alpine region where an American jet
sliced a cable car line, sending 20 people plunging to their death.
	   During a visit of the accident site, the group told regional
officials they hoped to hand them a dlrs 20 million check within 90
days. The funds, which must still be approved by the Senate, will
also go towards resconstructing the gondola line.
	   ``We hope the economic recovery will be quick so the ski area
can be rebuilt and we can put this tragic accident behind us,''
Bill Young, R-Fla., chairman of the House Appropriations
Subcommittee on national security, told reporters in Cavelese.
	   In addition to Young, the delegation included two committee
staff members, the U.S. consul general in Milan, George Griffin,
and the U.S. ambassador to Italy, Thomas Foglietta, accompanied by
an embassy official.
	   ``I hope that today we can alleviate the difficulties of this
town,'' said Foglietta after touring the area to determine how the
United States could contribute to reviving the region's
tourism-based economy, which nosedived following the accident.
	   Evidence showed the Marine Corps EA-6B Prowler, on a low-level
training mission, was flying too fast and too low when it struck
the cable at the Cermis ski area Feb. 3.
	   Following investigative hearings in Camp Lejeune, N.C., a
military judge recommended courts-martial for the jet's pilot and
navigator on charges including involuntary manslaughter. The judge
asked that charges against two backseat crewmen be dropped.
	   On Monday, a court in Trento will consider an Italian
prosecutor's request that the U.S. Marine crew also be indicted in
Italy.

Chernobyl victims protests cuts in national programs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Dozens of demonstrators rallied at
Ukraine's Cabinet headquarters on Thursday to protest a recent
presidential decree that would cut Chernobyl programs.
	   The protesters, who came from regions heavily contaminated by
the 1986 catastrophe, protested against President Leonid Kuchma's
decision to halve payments by employers to the state-owned
Chernobyl Fund.
	   ``Implementation of the decree will almost completely destroy
all social programs targeting Chernobyl victims,'' said Yuri
Andreyev of the Chernobyl Ukraine Union, which organized the
picket.
	   He said Kuchma's decree, which cut employers' payments to the
Chernobyl Fund to 5 percent of their workers' salaries, would
deprive the government of the money to finance medical treatment
and pay compensation to those who suffered from the Chernobyl
disaster.
	   The government set up the fund to address the consequences of
the 1986 explosion and fire that destroyed Chernobyl's reactor No.
4 and sent a radioactive cloud over much of Europe.
	   The 10 percent Chernobyl tax allowed the government to collect
over dlrs 1 billion annually.
	   Thursday's picket by some 150 protesters continued a series of
recent demonstrations by angry Chernobyl victims near government
headquarters in Kiev.
	   The government estimates that over 10 percent of Ukrainian
territory has been contaminated by radiation. About 3,600
Ukrainians who took part in the Chernobyl cleanup effort have died
from radiation exposure.
	   Kuchma recently estimated Chernobyl's total cost to Ukraine at
dlrs 130 billion.

Getty has world's most expensive book _ but may not display this
</HEADLINE>
one &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Sir Paul Getty, the American-born billionaire
philanthropist, has not yet decided whether to put on display his
most recently acquired treasure, the world's most expensive book,
the dealer said Thursday.
	   Getty bought a first edition of Geoffrey Chaucer's ``Canterbury
Tales'' Wednesday for 4,621,500 pounds (dlrs 7.53 million).
	   The auctioneers, Christie's, said the red leather-bound classic
of English literature _ printed by William Caxton, England's
earliest typographer, in either 1476 or 1477 _ fetched a record
price, outstripping the dlrs 5.3 million paid at auction in New
York in Oct. 1987 for a Gutenberg bible printed in 1455.
	   Getty called the book ``one of the finest in any library in the
world'' and said he has admired it for a long time.
	   ``Canterbury Tales'' was one of eight rare books sold at the
auction. All were part of a collection owned by Olive, Countess
Fitzwilliam, and housed at Wentworth Woodhouse in Yorkshire,
northern England. The collection was started in the 15th century by
Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford.
	   ``I have always hoped that it might be sold one day by the
family,'' Getty said. ``But never dared to expect that I would be
able to own such a book and ensure its retention in this country.''
	   Robert Harding, a representative of the London book dealer Maggs
Brothers which bought the book on behalf of Getty, said, for the
moment, Getty plans to keep the book at his estate library in
Britain.
	   ``A decision has not yet been taken as to what will happen to it
in the end,'' he said.
	   The 17,000 line tale tells the story of a group of pilgrims
traveling from London to Canterbury Cathedral to visit St. Thomas a
Beckett's shrine.
	   Getty, who became a naturalized Briton last year, has given at
least 120 million pounds (200 million dlrs) to the arts to keep
other works of art in Britain.
	   ``Canterbury Tales,'' sold for 6 pounds (dlrs 10) at a
Christie's sale in 1776. This time, Christie's had estimated its
sale price between 500,000 pounds (dlrs 800,000) and 700,000 pounds
(dlrs 1.12 million).

Australia wants to extend its sea area, scientists say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Australia will seek jurisdiction over
an additional 2.5 million square miles (6 million square
kilometers) of seabed and subsoil under a claim being prepared for
the United Nations, government scientists said Thursday.
	   The area stretches far beyond Australia's current 200-nautical
mile Exclusive Economic Zone and would increase the offshore area
over which Australia has rights to more than 7.4 million square
miles (19 million square kilometers), compared with its almost 5
million square-mile (13 million square-kilometer) land mass.
	   Philip Symonds, principal research scientist with the Australian
Geological Survey Organization, said it has just finished
collecting data under which Australia would define the outer limits
of its legal continental shelf.
	   Scientists will spend three years interpreting the data before
lodging Australia's shelf limit claim under the 1982 U.N.
Convention on the Law of the Sea by a deadline in 2004.
	   Symonds told the Australian Marine Sciences Association
conference the claim would give Australia rights over conventional
resources such as oil, gas and mineral deposits in the extended
continental shelf.
	   It also would provide rights to unconventional resources such as
bacteria on the seafloor that could be used for pharmaceutical
production in the future.
	   Under the U.N. convention, Australia would not have fishing
rights to the extended zone, he said.
	   ``The bottom line is that we don't really know what may be there
because these areas are so remote and unexplored. It's frontier
territory,'' Symonds said.
	   During the organization's most recent data collection foray,
scientists found gas hydrates trapped in sediment in the Northern
Lord Howe Rise, near Lord Howe Island, about 600 yards (meters)
below the seafloor.
	   Symonds said gas hydrates _ frozen methane and water trapped in
sediment _ could become an alternative source of gas and may hold
twice the energy contained in all the world's known resources of
oil, natural gas and coal.
	   Australia would have to negotiate with neighboring countries to
define the legal boundaries between the countries before lodging
its claim.
	   Eventually, it also would have to provide a proportion of the
income generated from the extra jurisdiction to the international
community to benefit landlocked and other geographically
disadvantaged countries, he said.

Five artists nominated for prestigious Japanese culture awards
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Jurors for the prestigious
Japanese-sponsored Praemium Imperiale awarded lifetime achievement
prizes Thursday to five artists.
	   The winners, announced in Munich, were: British director Richard
Attenborough; Russian composer Sofia Gubaidulina; Israeli sculptor
Dani Karavan; American painter Robert Rauschenberg; and Portuguese
architect Alvaro Siza.
	   The awards of 15 million yen (dlrs 143,600) will be presented in
Tokyo in October. The Praemium Imperiale honors artistic fields not
covered by Nobel Prizes, and the awards are often referred to as
the Japanese Nobel for culture.
	   Attenborough was cited for his films ``Gandhi'' and ``Cry for
Freedom;'' Rauschenberg for the strength and playfulness of his
work in mixed media; and Karavan for his recognition as a UNESCO
``Artist for Peace.''
	   Jurors honored Siza's architecture for its ``clearness and
simplicity.''
	   Gubaidulina, who has lived in Germany's port city of Hamburg
since 1992, has had international success with her compositions
since 1985.
	   Only Attenborough and Rauschenberg did not attend the brief
ceremony.
	   Also on hand for the announcement were three jurors: German
Chancellor Helmut Schmidt; former British Prime Minister Edward
Heath; and former French Prime Minister Raymond Barre.
	   The other jurors are U.S. industrialist David Rockefeller Jr.,
Japan's former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and Italian
industrialist Umberto Agnelli.
	   Previous award winners have included artist Cy Twombly, actor
Sir John Gielgud, composer Leonard Bernstein, architect I.M. Pei
and film director Ingmar Bergman.

Italy's coalition government partners meet to heal divisions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with premier, party leaders confident government will
survive; edits to conform &QL; 
 &UR; With AP photos

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Premier Romano Prodi and his political allies
emerged from key talks Thursday confident that the government will
survive.
	   ``I believe that the government will last the entire
legislature,'' said Massimo D'Alema, leader of the Democratic Left,
the main force in Prodi's center-left government.
	   In office since mid-1996, the government already has lasted
longer than a large part of the other 54 Italian governments since
World War II. Its mandate expires in 2001.
	   ``The meeting was very constructive,'' Prodi said. ``A new cycle
of reform has opened.''
	   Prodi called a vote of confidence in Parliament for next week,
which he is expected to win.
	   He called the talks after the Communist Refoundation party,
which is outside the coalition but gives Prodi a majority in the
Chamber of Deputies, refused last month to back the government on a
bill for NATO's eastward expansion. The measure passed with the
support of a centrist opposition party.
	   The Communists, led by Fausto Bertinotti, are demanding stronger
strategies to combat unemployment in exchange for continued
support.
	   However, they have said they would back Prodi in any confidence
vote, making any imminent government collapse or early elections,
unlikely.
	   ``Some steps forward have been made,'' Bertinotti said after
emerging from the talks, which are expected to continue for several
days. ``But we have yet to make a real breakthrough.''
	   However, he called the test of the government in Parliament ``an
obligatory step,'' indicating Prodi's coalition would not fall
apart.
	   The Communists main requests are a 35-hour work week and a new
agency to help create jobs in Italy's lesser developed south where
unemployment is twice the national rate of 12.5 percent.
	   Prodi has said that if a strong coalition does not emerge from
the talks, he won't lead another one.

	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Jurors for the prestigious
Japanese-sponsored Praemium Imperiale awarded lifetime achievement
prizes Thursday to five artists.
	   The winners, announced in Munich, were: British director Richard
Attenborough; Russian composer Sofia Gubaidulina; Israeli sculptor
Dani Karavan; American painter Robert Rauschenberg; and Portuguese
architect Alvaro Siza.
	   The awards of 15 million yen (dlrs 143,600) will be presented in
Tokyo in October. The Praemium Imperiale honors artistic fields not
covered by Nobel Prizes; the awards are often referred to as the
Japanese Nobel for culture.
	   Attenborough was cited for his films ``Gandhi'' and ``Cry for
Freedom;'' Rauschenberg for the strength and playfulness of his
work in mixed media; and Karavan for his recognition as a UNESCO
``Artist for Peace.''
	   Jurors honored Siza's architecture for its ``clearness and
simplicity.''
	   Gubaidulina, who has lived in Germany's port city of Hamburg
since 1992, has had international success with her compositions
since 1985.
	   Only Attenborough and Rauschenberg did not attend the brief
ceremony.
	   Also on hand for the announcement were three jurors: former
German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt; former British Prime Minister
Edward Heath; and former French Prime Minister Raymond Barre.
	   The other jurors are U.S. industrialist David Rockefeller Jr.,
Japan's former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and Italian
industrialist Umberto Agnelli.
	   Previous award winners have included artist Cy Twombly, actor
Sir John Gielgud, composer Leonard Bernstein, architect I.M. Pei
and film director Ingmar Bergman.

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ An explosion apparently caused by a gas
container ripped through Istanbul's crowded tourist area Thursday,
killing at least seven people in a historic spice market, the
semi-official Anatolia news agency reported.
	   Some 104 people were injured, including 11 foreigners, the
report said adding that three French, three Germans, two Iraqis,
two Norwegians and one Romanian national were brought to hospital
for care.
	   No further details on their condition were available. Five
people were said to be in a serious condition.
	   Many people were injured in the panic that followed the blast.
	   The explosion was reportedly triggered by a faulty gas container
used for a stove at a food stand in the covered market.
	   ``It is highly unlikely that is was a bomb. We are working on
the basis that it was a gas explosion,'' Citici said.
	   But explosives experts rushed to the scene to determine whether
a bomb might have caused the explosion, said Istanbul's Police
Chief Hasan Ozdemir. Anatolia quoted Istanbul's anti-terrorism unit
as saying that no traces of a bomb were found at the scene.
	   The market was evacuated.

Defense makes final arguments in extradition hearing

 &UR; By DANNA HARMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli judge said Thursday he will rule by
September 1 on whether an American teen-ager wanted for murder in
Maryland can be extradited to the United States.
	   Samuel Sheinbein's lawyer delivered six hours of closing
arguments in the closed door hearing on Thursday to wrap up months
of testimony. Sheinbein, 17, sat in court handcuffed and shackled.
When asked by a reporter during recess whether he wanted to say
something, Sheinbein laughed and shook his head.
	   Sheinbein, clean-shaven and wearing a white T-shirt and black
pants, sat close to his parents in the crowded, stuffy courtroom.
His father, Sol, squeezed the younger Sheinbein's hand from time to
time, and at one point kissed him on the head and ruffled his hair.
Sheinbein reached out once and touched the hand of his mother,
Victoria.
	   Mrs. Sheinbein left the hearings weeping, and declined to speak
to reporters. As her son went out of the courthouse, she hugged and
kissed him and emptied a box of chocolate chip granola bars into
his chained hands.
	   Defense lawyer David Libai delivered six hours of final
arguments on why his client should not be sent to Maryland to stand
trial in the September dismemberment killing of a 19-year-old
acquaintance, Alfred Tello Jr.
	   Sheinbein fled to Israel after the killing and is claiming
Israeli citizenship in an attempt to prevent his extradition.
Israeli law bars citizens from being sent abroad to stand trial.
	   ``In my understanding of the term citizen, it's not a term that
is divisible,'' Libai told the court. ``Either a person is a
citizen or they're not a citizen ... and Samuel Sheinbein is a
citizen.''
	   Israeli prosecutor Irit Kaan has said that allowing Sheinbein to
take refuge in Israel would be a ``cynical exploitation'' of
Israel's citizenship laws.
	   Sheinbein's lawyers argue that his father is an Israeli citizen,
and that the status was automatically passed on to him.
	   But Israel says that Sheinbein's father lost his citizenship
because he moved his family to the United States in 1950, before
the country's citizenship law went into effect.
	   Sheinbein never lived in Israel and never held an Israeli
passport.
	   Another teen-ager charged in the murder, 18-year-old Aaron
Needle, hanged himself in his Maryland cell in April.

Real Madrid coach resigns after month on job
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reports that club is chasing Dutch national
coach &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Real Madrid was reported to be chasing
Dutch World Cup coach Guus Hiddink to replace Jose Luis Camacho who
resigned unexpectedly Thursday after just three weeks on the job,
news reports said.
	   No sooner had Real chairman Lorenzo Sanz accepted the
resignation but club officials began seeking contacts with Hiddink,
the Spanish national news agency EFE said. Hiddink is currently in
France awaiting the Netherlands' game Saturday against Croatia for
third place in the World Cup.
	   A former Real Madrid player, Camacho, 43, was hired on June 17
with a two-year contract. He was the team's third coach in three
seasons.
	   Camacho took over from German Jupp Heynckes, who was fired
despite having guided the club to a record seventh European
Champions title in May.
	   Camacho resigned following disagreements over new player
signings and transfers and over who would be his team trainer,
according to EFE.
	   The decision came as a blow to Real given that it occurs in the
run-up to the start of the new season on Aug. 30. He was also a
popular figure among team members and club officials.
	   Camacho was to hold a press conference later Thursday to explain
his decision.
	   Hiddink, meanwhile, is a known figure in Spain having previously
coached Valencia.
	   As a player with Madrid between 1974 and 1989, Camacho won six
championships and two UEFA Cup trophies. In recent years he has
coached first divisision sides Espanyol and Sevilla.

World Cup: French dreams of title awaken Brazil
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LESIGNY, France (AP) _ The French may be causing Brazilians to
lose sleep, but not over the prospect of meeting their hosts in the
World Cup final.
	   A boisterous party erupted outside the team's hotel in this
quiet Paris suburb, moments after France beat Croatia 2-1 Wednesday
night to reach the final for the first time.
	   The usually sedate residents cheered and honked car horns at the
hotel gate until Brazilian coach Mario Zagallo came down and asked
police to disperse them.
	   But for Zagallo, the pressure of home crowd fans is France's
biggest weapon. Their team doesn't impress him, and he promises to
turn the tables after the game.
	   ``A full house is their greatest strength,'' he said. ``But
after Sunday, they're the ones that won't sleep.''
	   Zagallo thought the ``Blues'' looked nervous against a Croatian
team that wasn't up to its previous game, when it knocked out
three-time Cup winner Germany.
	   ``They showed that they're not prepared to reach the final,''
Zagallo said. ``They lacked the jersey,'' a Brazilian term meaning
soccer tradition.
	   ``Jersey'' is what Brazilians have over any rival. The only team
to play in all 16 World Cups, they have reached the final five
times and won four of them.
	   France also will be weakened by the absence of Laurent Blanc,
who was expelled for pushing Croatia's Slaven Bilic in the face.
The sturdy Olympique Marseille defender was one reason France has
allowed just two goals in six games.
	   But even with Blanc, the French defense doesn't awe Zagallo. He
thinks the French will offer fewer problems than the Dutch, who
took Brazil to a shootout before succumbing.
	   ``France plays offensively. It's the team that has shot more
than any in the Cup. So it pays a price on defense,'' Zagallo said.
Barring Croatia, he added, ``they haven't faced a team with a
strong attack.''
	   Zico, the team's coordinator, also was not overwhelmed by
France's performance.
	   ``They didn't play well against Croatia. The Dutch were
better,'' he said. ``They're a dangerous team but not intimidating
and certainly not unbeatable.''
	   Zico thinks the French will miss Blanc's leadership, though he
urges caution with playmaker Zinedine Zidane and versatile defender
Lilian Thuram, who scored both goals against Croatia.
	   Still, Brazilians know how a home crowd can pick up a team. On
Sunday, 80,000 spectactors will pack Stade de France, and for once
Brazil's yellow jerseys won't set the tone.
	   ``Fans are important in big games,'' Zagallo said. ``The best we
can do is not to antagonize them.''
	   A winner of four Cups as player, coach or coordinator, Zagallo
understands the significance of the moment.
	   ``This is the biggest sporting event of the century,'' he said.
``We're in the capital of the world, the owners of the house are in
the final and will try for their first title against the four-time
champions. And every team outdoes itself against Brazil.''
	   Still, it's hard to match the Brazilian jersey.
	   ``We have a history in World Cups,'' said midfielder Leonardo.
``And that gives us a lot of support.''

Marines end record losing streak at 18
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Chiba Lotte Marines finally got enough hits and
ran up a big enough lead.
	   With a 9-1 cushion after five innings, they held on for a 9-6
victory over the Orix BlueWave at Kobe Thursday and ended their
Japanese professional baseball record losing streak at 18 games.
	   The Marines rapped out 18 hits while the BlueWave had 14,
including eight in the sixth inning, when they scored five runs.
	   The old record of 16 consecutive losses was set by the former
DaiTokyo team in 1936 and tied by the Yakult Swallows in 1970.
	   The Marines also had a lead over the BlueWave Tuesday, but ended
up with a 7-3 loss _ the record-breaking No. 17 in a row _ in 12
innings. No. 18 was a 6-4 loss to the BlueWave on Wednesday.
	   The streak started June 13, also with a 6-4 loss to the
BlueWave.
	   In another Pacific League game, Rob Mattson pitched a six-hitter
over 8 1/3 inning and Phil Clark and Tuffy Rhodes each hit a home
run as the Kintetsu Buffaloes beat the front-running Nippon Ham
Fighters 9-2 at Tokyo Dome.
	   Mattson, who formerly played in the Mexican League, is 2-0.
	   Clark and Rhodes each have 12 homers. Both joined the Buffaloes
from the Boston Red Sox.
	   The Fighters are still seven games ahead of the Buffaloes, who
moved into second place with the victory.
	   At Seibu Dome, Domingo Martinez hit a two-run home run in the
three-run first inning as the Seibu Lions beat the Fukuoka Daiei
Hawks 5-1 in a game called in the top of the eighth inning because
of torrential rains.
	   Martinez, formerly with the Triple-A Rochester team, has 17
homers.
	   The Lions ended their losing streak at three and the Hawks ended
their winning streak at seven.
	   In the Central League, the front-running Yokohama BayStars beat
the Hanshin Tigers 11-3 on 15 hits at Osaka Dome.
	   The BayStars are two games ahead of the Chunichi Dragons, who
lost to the Yakult Swallows 8-1 at Nagoya Dome.
	   The Swallows' Shinya Miyamoto singled home two runs in the
four-run first inning.
	   The Yomiuri Giants and the Hiroshima Toyo Carp were idle
Thursday.

	   BERLIN (AP) _ It started out small _ just 150 people dancing
behind a VW van.
	   Ten years later, the Love Parade has become the world's biggest
open-air rave _ a colossal blowout in the heart of Berlin to the
thumping, electronic beat of techno music. Last year, 1 million
exuberant techno lovers shimmied around the bass-booming
megaspeakers, a turnout expected to be matched Saturday at Love
Parade 98.
	   Hotels, restaurants, bars and dance clubs rejoice at the extra
business, estimated at 180 million marks (dlrs 100 million) in
1997. City officials revel in the positive publicity and youthful
image the psychedelic parade gives Berlin.
	   Organizers call it a paean to peace and tolerance.
	   But despite the mellow message _ this year's theme is ``One
World, One Future'' _ not everyone loves the Love Parade, which in
1996 was rerouted for safety reasons from a crowded commercial
strip to a boulevard through the Tiergarten park.
	   Environmentalists trash it as a tree-killing, animal-scaring
eco-disaster.
	   And local officials grouse about cleanup and repairs.
	   ``With such a mass of people, plants are devastated and the
ground is tramped down so much that the trees will eventually
die,'' says Carmen Schultze of BUND, a national association of
environmental watchdogs.
	   Even the birds and squirrels get stressed.
	   ``They just withdraw from this area and hide,'' she says. ``Of
course it disturbs them.''
	   Last year, city officials had to pick up 264 tons of trash _ not
to mention hosing down grass and bushes with 300,000 liters (80,000
gallons) of water to dilute the flood of urine and wash away layers
of dust produced by the dancers.
	   Re-aerating trampled earth and replacing injured vegetation cost
260,000 marks (dlrs 144,000), says Horst Porath, a Tiergarten
official who wants the parade out of his backyard.
	   And because the parade is registered as a political
demonstration, rather than a commercial event, the city has to pick
up the tab.
	   Legally speaking, the Love Parade has no official organizer, so
it qualifies as a demonstration despite its money-making aspects,
says Petra Reetz, spokeswoman for city transportation department.
	   Besides, ``the city absolutely gets something out of it,'' she
adds, namely tax revenues, an international spotlight and lots of
free advertising.
	   Airlines are offering special Love Parade fares to Berlin. The
German railway added 69 Love Parade trains. And the subway system
is offering a weekend Love Parade ticket _ an ``attractive and
fluorescent'' armband.
	   Planetcom, the multimedia firm that runs the parade, has
copyrighted the yellow sun Love Parade logo, which appears on
T-shirts, caps and other items.
	   Sales are so brisk on Love Parade weekend they've even attracted
counterfeiters. Last year police seized about 4,500 phony items
worth some 100,000 marks (dlrs 56,000).
	   Planetcom also charges the 50 or so sound trucks 5,000 marks
(dlrs 2,800) each to join the parade and even has negotiated a deal
with a TV soap opera to film during the event.
	   All that raises about 1.5 million marks (dlrs 833,000), which
Planetcom manager Ralf Regitz insists is just enough to cover
costs, although he declines to release a detailed accounting.
	   Techno purists _ something of a counter-culture bunch _ complain
the parade has become less about love and more about money.
	   Regitz, 34, insists it's all about people expressing themselves
_ and says the lack of violence proves the message is still getting
through.
	   ``Here's a culture that's open and peaceful,'' he says. ``That's
the vision of the Love Parade.''
	   For the masses, though, it's more like a big party.
	   ``Peace and happiness and a lot of harmony _ there's nothing
wrong with that,'' says Heiko Thedens, 25, a student from Hamburg
who'll be attending his fifth Love Parade this weekend.
	   ``But I have to confess I never think a lot about it. I'm more
there to have fun.''

EU jobless rate holds steady at 10.2 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Unemployment in the European Union held
steady at 10.2 percent in May, unchanged from the previous two
months, according to figures released Thursday by the EU's
statistics office.
	   The EU rate compares with 4.4 percent in the United States and
4.1 percent in Japan.
	   Eurostat's data showed 17.1 million citizens were out of work
across the 15-nation bloc.
	   Year-on-year figures showed a slight decline in the unemployment
level from 10.7 percent in May, 1997, and 10.9 in May, 1996.
	   The jobless rate in the 11 countries adopting the euro as their
common currency on Jan. 1 was down to 11.2 from 11.3 in April.
	   Luxembourg had the lowest rate at 2.2 percent, Spain the highest
rate with 18.8 percent.
	   Eurostat gave the following seasonally-adjusted jobless rates
for May 1998 with May 1997 rates in brackets:
	   Luxembourg, 2.2 percent (2.6); Austria, 4.5 (4.3); Portugal, 6.4
(6.6); Sweden, 8.9 (10.3); Belgium, 8.9 (9.3); Ireland, 9.2 (10.2);
Germany, 9.8 (9.9); France, 11.9 (12.4); Finland, 12.7 (13.8);
Spain, 18.8 (21).
	   May 1998 figures were unavailable for Greece, Italy and the
Netherlands, Denmark and Britain.
	   Latest figures from Eurostat showed Denmark with 4.7 percent and
the Netherlands with 4.2 percent in April; Britain with 6.4 percent
in March; Italy with 12 percent in January; and Greece with 9.6
percent in May, 1997.

Moody's lowers Vietnam's debt rating, citing Asian financial
</HEADLINE>
crisis &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A leading credit agency lowered its rating of
Vietnam's debt further into speculative territory Thursday, a step
that could make it even more difficult and costly for the
financially troubled Asian nation to borrow money.
	   Vietnam's ratings on long-term bonds and on bank deposits were
already considered speculative, or in the ``junk'' category. On
Thursday, Moody's dropped the rating on long-term bonds to B1 from
Ba3, and on bank deposits to B3 from B1.
	   Only the service's top four grades are considered investment
quality, from a high of Aaa to the lowest investment grade Baa. The
rating Ba is a grade below investment quality, and Moody's uses
numbers from a high of 1 to a low of 3 to denote standing within a
grade. The B grade is two grades into speculative territory.
	   The lower the rating, the higher the risk of not being paid on
time. That means borrowers typically have to offer higher interest
to raise money when ratings are lowered. Some banks and trust funds
won't lend money to or buy bonds from borrowers listed in the
speculative-grade rankings.
	   Moody's, based in New York, said it lowered the ratings because
efforts to reform the Vietnamese economy have stalled, threatening
the nation's balance of payments and the banking sector. Also, the
agency said, Vietnam is particularly vulnerable to Asia's ongoing
financial crisis, although so far, foreign exchange controls have
kept the Vietnamese economy from going into a tailspin.
	   Moody's also cited a slowdown in foreign investment in Vietnam.

Supreme court to decide whether to reopen martial law trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The Supreme Court will decide whether a
provincial court made a formal error when it acquitted 22 riot
policemen in Poland's largest prosecution of martial law-era
deaths, a Warsaw appeals court said Thursday.
	   Drawing public outrage, a provincial court last November
acquitted the policemen of killing nine miners protesting the 1981
communist crackdown for lack of evidence.
	   The court said it was unable to verify if someone other than
riot police used weapons during the strike. The defendants claimed
that they shot into the air, well above the heads of the
protesters.
	   Prosecutors appealed the verdict claiming the court made a
formal mistake by not asking the plaintiff's side if they agreed to
replacing a judge who resigned under psychological stress.
	   If the Supreme Court rules an error was made, the trial will
reopen. If the verdict is upheld, an appeals court will consider a
prosecution request to re-examine the evidence.
	   The nine miners killed on the third day of martial law in 1981
after they refused to leave a mine were, the first fatalities in 1
1/2 year crackdown that eventually claimed the lives of 100
government opponents.

American Airlines flight to Boston forced back to London
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ An American Airlines jet made an emergency landing
Thursday after the captain took off for Boston and soon noticed a
warning light indicating an oil filter was blocked.
	   The captain switched off one engine of the Airbus 300-600 that
was carrying 174 passengers and 11 crew members and flew back to
Heathrow Airport.
	   But the jet braked hard on the runway, lighting a small fire in
the undercarriage, American spokeswoman Louise Falp said.
	   The fire was extinguished by emergency crews with no problems
and passengers were taken off the plane via a portable set of
stairs rather than using emergency landing slides, Falp said.
	   No one was hurt, she said.
	   The small fire was not connected with the oil filter problem,
and American expected to have the jet back in service later in the
day, Falp said.
	   ``It's not a major problem,'' she said.
	   The passengers who had hoped to get to Boston on flight AA 109
were set to depart five hours late on another jet, American said.

World Cup: In dream final at last, France dreams of victory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ France is floating on air after
reaching the World Cup final for the first time, elevated by a
groundswell of popular support. Les Bleus believe not even Brazil
will be able to bring it back to earth on Sunday.
	   If only there wasn't that one black cloud hanging overhead.
Defensive stalwart Laurent Blanc, emblematic of France's rush to
the final, will be suspended for hitting an opponent in Wednesday
night's 2-1 win over Croatia.
	   Coach Aime Jacquet wept tears of joy Wednesday, president
Jacques Chirac unabashedly celebrated in the stands, and all over
France there were some of the biggest parties since the 1944
Liberation.
	   Now comes Brazil, the dream final against a team the French
nation loves only a little bit less than its own.
	   ``'Brazil _ France.' The sound alone is already beautiful,''
said French defender Lilian Thuram, who scored both goals in the
semifinal win. ``This final is such a dream and it can lead us to
something beyond that.''
	   ``Now we hope for the ultimate happiness on Sunday,'' said
Jacquet, after a short night, cut even shorter by the celebrations
that accompanied France's first-ever qualification for the final.
	   There is no underestimating Brazil though. ``It's the greatest
team, they're the best,'' said Jacquet. But up against that, France
will throw a united front, welded in so many tough World Cup games
that lasted into the dying moments before releasing victory for the
French.
	   Jacquet said the team had to search in ``the deepest of the
heart and soul,'' to get to the final and he would now channel that
energy to conquer Brazil. ``We can move mountains after this.
Anything can happen.''
	   The final is seen as France's weak offense against Brazil's weak
defense and as the defending champion's potent offense against the
host nation's watertight defense.
	   France has one big hole to plug though _ Laurent Blanc. The
Marseille veteran scored the Golden Goal against Paraguay to get
France to the quarterfinals. He scored the decisive penalty in a
shootout against Italy to get France to the semifinals.
	   And the whole nation felt the red card was too tough on Blanc.
``I feel this great anger, this great anger,'' Jacquet said.
	   For six games, the central defender led an ironclad defense that
made France the envy of the world.
	   Now, Chelsea's Frank Leboeuf will line up with Marcel Desailly
at the heart of the defense instead. Leboeuf already had a good
match at that position in France's 2-1 win over Denmark in the
first round.
	   France has one day less to recover from the semifinal after
Brazil's Tuesday win over the Netherlands, but that will hardly
matter when Sunday rolls around.
	   ``For our whole lives we have wanted this so we will have all
the energy we need,'' said Thuram.
	   France's only injury worry is Christian Karembeu. The midfielder
reinjured his left ankle early on in Wednesday's game and was
celebrating with a thick pack of ice on his foot. Jacquet was
hoping though, he would be able to recover him for Sunday's final.
	   And the French players are hardly dwarfed by the challenge
ahead.
	   Ronaldo and Co. inspire respect _ and even that.
	   ``Sometimes we don't need to have too much respect. We have a
culture of victory now,'' said Thuram.
	   Captain Didier Deschamps agreed. ``We have our anti-Ronaldo plan
in place. It's called Marcel Desailly,'' he said of the defender
who has had a standout tournament so far.
	   ``We will welcome Brazil with all our might,'' said Jacquet.

China takes anti-dumping measures against foreign newsprint
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China has decided to take temporary anti-dumping
measures against newsprint from Canada, South Korea and the United
States, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade announced Thursday.
	   The decision follows an official investigation that determined
that 17 to 79 percent of imported Canadian, Korean and U.S.
newsprint was dumped, causing ``substantial damage to China's
newsprint industry,'' the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   Dumping involves selling a product abroad at a price lower than
in the producer's home market.
	   Xinhua said temporary anti-dumping measures against newsprint
from the three countries would begin Friday, although it gave no
details. Importers will have to pay cash deposits in accordance
with anti-dumping rulings, it said.
	   It added that investigations would continue and that officials
would issue a final decision in the case ``in due time.''
	   Chinese companies have been subject to hundreds of anti-dumping
investigations overseas. But the investigation launched by the
trade ministry in December 1997 was the first by Beijing against
foreign companies, Xinhua said.

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Track and field stars will compete for dlrs
7 million in prize money over six meets in the International
Amateur Athletic Federation's new Golden League series.
	   Individual athletes could win a dlrs 1 million jackpot by
winning their event at all six meets plus the IAAF Grand Prix
final.
	   IAAF president Primo Nebiolo said the additional prize money was
part of a sponsorship deal with Ericsson, the Swedish
telecommunications company.
	   The Golden League, devised by Nebiolo to increase the profile of
international athletics competition, was set to commence with the
Bislett Games in Oslo on Thursday.
	   The series will continue in Rome on July 14, Monaco, Zurich and
Brussels in August and in Berlin on Sept. 1 before culminating with
the IAAF Grand Prix final in Moscow on Sept 5.
	   Events in the men's competition will include 100 meters, 200,
400, 1,500, 3,000 (or 10,000), 400 hurdles, triple jump and pole
vault.
	   Women's events will include 100, 200, 400, 1,500, 100 hurdles
and javelin.

Parliament fails to elect president _ for the fifth time
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ A fifth attempt to elect a president
failed on Thursday, when a candidate nominated by the government
for parliamentary approval fell just short of the necessary votes.
	   University rector Otto Tomecek was the only candidate. He was
put forward by Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's Movement for
Democratic Slovakia.
	   Tomecek was supported by 86 legislators, four short of the 90
needed in the 150-seat legislature.
	   Slovakia has been without a president since March, when Meciar
rival Michal Kovac ended his term. In the absence of a replacement,
Meciar has assumed most of the president's powers, except the
authority to dismiss and appoint new governments.
	   To avoid legal limbo after parliamentary elections in September,
the government has proposed a law investing the speaker of
parliament with those powers. The bill is expected to be approved
next week.

Brazilian priests wrap themselves in flags, say virgin made team

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Brazilian priests attending an international
gathering here traded their vestments for the yellow jerseys of
their national soccer team and said the Virgin of Guadalupe
intervened in their victory.
	   The Brazilian priests are attending a weeklong gathering of
4,000 Roman Catholic priests from five continents being held at the
Basilica of Guadalupe, Mexico's holiest shrine.
	   During sessions Wednesday, the Brazilian clergymen draped their
national flag on a wall after Brazil's soccer team advanced to the
World Cup finals with a win Tuesday against the Netherlands.
	   ``The intervention of the Virgin of Guadalupe in the soccer game
gave the team its victory,'' a Brazilian priest told the local
newspaper Reforma, which didn't give his name.
	   The Virgin of Guadalupe is Mexico's patron saint, an apparition
of the Virgin Mary on a hillside just outside Mexico City in 1531.

Prosecutors investigate more than 10,000 bad loans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Prosecutors investigating Bulgaria's
economic crash a year ago are looking into more than 10,000 bad
loans worth 1.6 billion dollars, the general prosecutor announced
Thursday.
	   The cases include loans made by 41 state and private banks to
firms and individuals, Prosecutor General Ivan Tatarchev said.
	   ``Bank executives have have allowed loans without any control,
without the necessary guarantees and collateral,'' Tatarchev told
the state news agency BTA.
	   The prosecution is acting on a report on bad loans published
earlier this year by the central bank.
	   While some of the money has been used to keep inefficient state
companies going, much is suspected to have been embezzled under
former governments controlled by ex-communists.
	   One of Europe's poorest countries, Bulgaria owes dlrs 9 billion
in foreign debt. The average salary in the country of 8.2 million
is the equivalent of less than dlrs 100 a month.
	   Lax financial policies and foot-dragging on market reforms
resulted in hyperinflation in early 1997 that unleashed mass street
protests and forced the Socialist government of former communists
to resign.
	   The present government has imposed tight financial discipline
and pledged to prosecute those responsible for the economic
collapse.

Rogue monkey eludes police, terrorizes city residents

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A wild monkey has eluded police armed with nets and
bananas in the central Japanese city of Osaka, abducting pets and
terrorizing schoolchildren.
	   Police said they were continuing their hunt Thursday for the
monkey, which they said had probably descended into Japan's
third-largest city from mountains near its northern edge.
	   ``It just moves too fast,'' said Osaka police officer Noriyuki
Manabe.
	   Manabe said his precinct in northern Osaka had received a few
calls from residents reporting sightings, but each time the monkey
had vanished by the time officers rushed to the scene.
	   No injuries have been reported since the one-meter
(three-foot)-tall monkey first appeared Tuesday, Manabe said.
	   Police cornered the monkey at one point Wednesday but had to
back off after it seized two kittens. They feared the monkey might
harm the other animals, television reports quoted a city official
as saying.
	   The official, not named in the reports, said the monkey escaped
carrying the kittens, whose fate was unknown.
	   Also Wednesday, teachers at an elementary school in the nearby
town of Settsu locked windows and ordered children not to go home
alone after the monkey appeared on the building's roof, the city
official said.
	   The monkey slipped away even after police and television camera
crews surrounded the school.
	   National television showed dozens of police conducting a
house-to-house search Thursday of neighborhoods in northern Osaka.
	   They warned residents to avoid eye contact with the monkey,
which might provoke an attack.
	   TV footage showed the policemen moving in pairs, one carrying a
two-meter (6.5-foot) pole with bananas dangling from the end and
the other holding a large net.
	   Monkeys have long been a problem in many areas in rural Japan,
where they damage crops, swipe food from grocery stalls and even
bite humans.
	   Monkey population growth in recent years means they are making
more frequent forays out of the forests and into the farms and
towns.
	   The monkeys, a species of macaque, are one of the most common
wild mammals in Japan.

Foreigners eligible only for jobs Malaysians don't want
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia will only renew work
permits of foreigners toiling in service-sector jobs shunned by
Malaysians, the government said Thursday.
	   As the government continues to sweep the country of foreigners
to provide more jobs for Malaysians during the economic downturn,
Malaysians have deemed certain jobs unfit, said Deputy Home
Minister Tajol Rosli Ghazali.
	   The recently created Special Cabinet Committee on Foreign
Workers decided that foreigners therefore could retain jobs at
cemeteries, vegetable gardens, old age homes, laundries, gas
stations and other workplaces undesirable to Malaysians, Tajol was
quoted as saying by the Bernama news agency.
	   Employers told the special committee that Malaysians didn't seem
to want those jobs, which entail long hours and offer no job
security, Tajol said.
	   Work permits for more desirable jobs will not be renewed,
including those for positions at beauty salons, health clinics,
supermarkets and furniture shops, Tajol said.
	   Employers will only be allowed to renew service-sector work
permits for foreigners already in the country. New applications for
work permits in the plantation and manufacturing sectors, however,
would still be accepted, Tajol said.
	   Authorities have cracked down on foreign workers as the
country's economic woes deepened. Since January, an estimated
30,000 Indonesian illegal entrants, who made up the majority of
Malaysia's foreign work force, have been deported and another
200,000 are expected to be kicked out by Aug. 15, the government
says.
	   Tajol said Malaysia currently had 977,276 foreign workers,
compared with 1.1 million earlier.

Court orders retrial of nurse sentenced to death for murder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An Egyptian nurse condemned to death for
murder won a reprieve Thursday when the Court of Cassation set the
sentence aside and ordered a retrial.
	   Court officials said the appeal judges, led by Mohammed Yahia
Rashwan, found that the original verdict against Aida Nur el-Din
was flawed.
	   Their finding supported the view of Prosecutor-General Raja
al-Arabi who had asked the appeal court in May to overturn the
death sentence, saying the Alexandria criminal court had failed to
make sure that she intended to kill when she injected a patient
with muscle relaxant, court officials said.
	   Nur el-Din, 25, was convicted of murdering a patient, Mohammed
Abdel-Qader Ibrahim, and attempting to kill 29 others by injecting
them with respiratory muscle relaxants. She was sentenced to death
on March 11.
	   She did not attend Thursday's session, but her relatives were
present.
	   Nur el-Din was arrested in August 1997 after staff at Al-Meeri
Hospital in Alexandria discovered a pattern in the deaths of 33
patients from respiratory failure shortly after they had
successfully undergone surgery.
	   Police say they suspected her of being behind all 33 deaths, but
she was charged with the murder of the only patient on whom an
autopsy was conducted.
	   Nur el-Din pleaded innocence, claiming she was framed by
hospital officials and doctors seeking to cover their negligence.
Her case sparked accusations in the local media about malpractice
in Egypt's hospitals.
	   The case also pitted doctors and nurses against each other, with
nurses arguing that they are over-worked, underpaid and abused by
physicians.
	   Nur el-Din's defense lawyers appealed the verdict on numerous
grounds. Prosecutor-General al-Arabi said Nur el-Din was not sure
that her injections were going to cause death and, therefore, she
did not have the intention to kill.
	   In a bizarre twist, Nur el-Din fell from a third-story window of
a police station while being led to an interrogation room. It was
never determined if she jumped or was pushed.
	   Nur el-Din also was convicted of illegally administering drugs
to patients and forging patient records to hide their condition.

Yeltsin too weak for a third term, aide says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. Recasts throughout, CHANGES byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By MAURA REYNOLDS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin's health is so poor that he cannot
maintain a vigorous work schedule and should not run for another
term in office, a senior aide said in an interview published
Thursday.
	   The remarks by Igor Shabdurasulov contradict the standard
Kremlin line that the president's health is strong.
	   ``You can't say that Yeltsin is in ideal physical shape, that
he's full of energy and activity to work round the clock,''
Shabdurasulov, Yeltsin's recently appointed deputy chief of staff,
said in an interview with the liberal daily Russky Telegraph.
	   ``It seems to me that he has become so tired both physically and
psychologically that it outweighs every politician's natural desire
for power,'' Shabdurasulov said.
	   The remarks were highly unusual for a senior aide, and they drew
a swift retort from Yeltsin's office.
	   Shabdurasulov ``expressed his own viewpoint, which does not
reflect the opinion of the leadership of the presidential
administration,'' said spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky.
	   Yeltsin's uncertain health periodically sparks rumors that the
president is seriously ill. A new round of unsubstantiated rumors
began Thursday, apparently originating in foreign financial
markets.
	   Yastrzhembsky said Yeltsin was feeling well and holding meetings
as planned.
	   Doctors say the 67-year-old president, who underwent a heart
bypass in November 1996, has fully recovered and is in good shape.
Yeltsin makes regular public appearances and has made clear he
intends to serve out his current term, which runs two more years.
	   However, the Kremlin makes no secret of the fact that the
president spends much more time at his country residence outside
Moscow than he did before his operation. It is a rare week in which
he spends five full days working at the Kremlin.
	   Yeltsin still makes working trips inside Russia and abroad,
though he travels less frequently than during his early years in
office.
	   Shabdurasulov's comments were surprising because top Kremlin
officials generally refuse to speak about the president's health,
other than to say that he's well.
	   Yeltsin has repeatedly said he does not intend to run for
another term in the year 2000, but he has not flatly ruled it out.
	   Russia's constitution, approved in 1993, limits a president to
two terms.
	   But some Kremlin aides say that Yeltsin's first term, from 1991
to 1996, doesn't count because it began before the Soviet Union
collapsed and the current constitution took effect.
	   Russia's Constitutional Court is expected to rule on the issue
later this year.
	   Shabdurasulov said Yeltsin himself is still hesitating about
whether to run again.
	   ``He hasn't made a firm decision yet,'' Shabdurasulov told the
newspaper.
	   Shabdurasulov served as a spokesman for former Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin, who was sacked in March. In April,
Shabdurasulov was named deputy presidential chief of staff in
charge of relations with media.

After long controversy, Alberta's Chinamans Peak gets new name
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CALGARY, Alberta (AP) _ A mountain peak near Banff National
Park, known for decades as Chinamans Peak, has been given a new
name after prolonged debate over whether the original name was
derogatory.
	   The Alberta government had withdrawn the official status of the
name Chinamans Peak last year after receiving complaints that it
reflected an era when people of Chinese origin were looked down on.
	   On Wednesday, the peak was formally renamed Ha Ling Peak, in
honor of a miner who lived in the era at the end of the 19th
century and scaled the mountain on a bet.

EU foreign policy chief optimistic about Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The European Union has become Russia's main
trading partner and an important investor in Russia's economy, the
foreign policy chief of the European Commission said Thursday,
according to a news agency.
	   Hans van der Broek said economic cooperation between Russia and
the EU is developing quickly, giving him hope that Russia will
weather its present financial crisis, the Interfax news agency
said.
	   European Union countries account for 40 percent of all Russian
exports and 50 percent of all foreign investment in Russia, van der
Broek said.
	   Exports to Russia from the EU in 1997 totaled ECU 23 billion
(dlrs 21 billion), five times the figure for 1991.
	   Van der Broek was meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov on Thursday to discuss Russia's economic problems, among
other things.

Havel takes break from politics to meet rock star Lou Reed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) - Between tedious negotiations on
forming a new Cabinet, President Vaclav Havel found time Thursday
to meet with American pop singer Lou Reed.
	   ``The president found out that his friend Lou Reed is around and
decided to invite him over for a private visit,'' a presidential
spokesman, Martin Krafl, said.
	   Havel thanked Reed for his hospitality during the president's
last private visit to New York and ``recalled the good times they
had together,'' the spokesman said.
	   The meeting took place as Havel was conferring with political
leaders on forming a new government after last month's elections,
in which no party won a clear majority in the Czech parliament.
	   Reed, founder of the rock group ``The Velvet Underground,'' is
attending an international film festival in Karlovy Vary, 150
kilometers (90 miles) west of Prague.
	   The two have known each other since 1990 when Reed was sent to
what was then Czechoslovakia by Rolling Stone magazine to interview
Havel.
	   In the past, Havel has invited other pop stars, including the
Rolling Stones and Michael Jackson, to his office at the Prague
Castle.

World Cup: On brightest day for Les Bleus, black day for Blanc
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ Laurent Blanc had been the
cornerstone during the whole of France's World Cup campaign. Now
Les Bleus will almost certainly have to do without him during
Sunday's final against Brazil.
	   Fifteen minutes away from the supreme match, he was sent off in
the closing stages of France's 2-1 semifinal win over Croatia
Wednesday, for slapping an opponent in the face.
	   ``I have this feeling of having tasted the cake, but now I'm not
allowed to touch the cherry,'' said Blanc.
	   The veteran Olympique Marseille defender scored the World Cup's
first extra time ``Golden Goal'' against Paraguay to get France to
the quarterfinals. He also scored the decisive penalty in a
shootout against Italy to get France to the semifinals.
	   For six games, the central defender led an ironclad defense that
made France the envy of the World Cup.
	   A red card usually carries an automatic suspension for at least
one match, and even though the French federation is appealing to
FIFA, it has little hope.
	   ``We fear it will be a formality. We always have hope but I
don't want to give Blanc any false hope,'' said French coach Aime
Jacquet. ``It was unjust, it was too harsh of the referee,'' he
said of the decision by Spain's Jose Maria Garcia.
	   No sooner had the French tried to prise open the door for Blanc
to play, then FIFA slammed it shut.
	   ``A one or two-game ban can't be appealed against,'' said FIFA
spokesman Marius Schneider. ``Only a suspension of three games or
more can be appealed.
	   ``The disciplinary committee doesn't have the power to relieve
him of a suspension for this match.''
	   The whole nation was crying out injustice because it felt the
goalmouth incident deserved perhaps a yellow card but certainly not
an expulsion that robbed the Marseille player of his greatest day.
	   ``It's a personal catastrophe,'' the 32-year old defender said.
``It would have been worse if the Croats would have been allowed to
come back and beat us. Then I would never have forgiven myself.''
	   It was Blanc's first sending off for France in 74
internationals.
	   Together with Marcel Desailly in the center of defense, Blanc
had given poise and confidence to the team over the last month as
it scored six successive World Cup wins.
	   And for symbolism, nothing could be more cruel to Les Bleus. For
six games so far Blanc had been kissing goalie Fabien Barthez on
his bald head, before and after the game, and the lucky charm
worked like a dream.
	   ``It has brought us luck. See, we're in the final,'' said
Barthez. ``I'm sure Laurent will be able to come up with something
for the final.''
	   Blanc wasn't as sweet with Slaven Bilic through.
	   During the whole match, whenever the tall Blanc surged forward
for freekicks and corners, he came face-to-face with the Croat
defender in one long push-and-shove match.
	   And so again in the 75th minute.
	   ``We scuffled and there was contact. Then he threw himself on
the ground,'' said Blanc. Red came out and France had to pull back
in defense to put off the Croats seeking a last-minute equalizer.
	   Bilic said that Blanc's red card was all his own fault.
	   ``I didn't get him sent off, he did,'' the Everton defender
said.
	   ``He touched me, technically that's an offense, and the referee
saw it.
	   ``I'm not happy that he's going to miss the final, but if you do
something like that you're going to get punished,'' Bilic said.
	   Blanc saw it differently. ``It was a free kick for me. I had not
intention to get hold of him. He gripped me.
	   He said that after the match, Bilic came over to apologize.
``Maybe I should have punched him there,'' he said, only half in
jest.

Israeli sculptor Dani Karavan wins Praemium Imperiale prize

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) - Israeli sculptor Dani Karavan says he hopes winning
Japan's 100,000-dollar Praemium Imperiale prize will help make city
officials aware of the need to preserve outdoor sculpture created
for specific sites.
	   The 67-year-old artist famous for spectacular, sprawling works
incorporating the elements was among the five laureates announced
today in Munich.
	   The others are Robert Rauschenberg of the United States for
painting, Portugal's Alvaro Siza for architecture, composer Sofia
Gubaidulina of Russia for music, and Britain's Richard Attenborough
for film.
	   Karavan, who spends half the year working in Paris, has created
site-specific pieces the world over: a tribute to Walter Benjamin
on the spot where he died during World War II on the Spanish coast
and a garden of white concrete and trees in Seoul's Olympic Park,
among them.
	   His early works include the Negev monument _ a village of
concrete forms overlooking the Israeli desert city of Beersheva.
	   ``It has been poorly maintained, but it was strong and it
survived,'' Karavan said in a recent interview. ``Perhaps officials
will now take note and decide to restore it.''
	   Karavan said the prize was ``confirmation that what I'm doing is
right.''
	   ``It gives me the strength to go on. What I do isn't
intellectual. It isn't abstract. I start with a site and I look, I
think, I listen. I try to understand what it needs, what it will
accept,'' he said.
	   Karavan he hoped the prize would alert administrators worldwide
to the importance of upkeep.
	   ``Maintenance is the main problem today. You need administrators
who are committed to protecting public art,'' he said.
	   The prestige may also help him find the funds to complete ``Axe
Majeur,'' an 18-year-old project in Cergy-Pontoise, an industrial
suburb northwest of Paris.
	   Karavan is currently working on ``The Way of Peace,'' a row of
100 columns inscribed with the word peace in 100 languages which
stretches along three kilometers of the Israeli-Egyptian border.
	   ``Maybe now the Egyptian government will be encouraged to
commission one of their own artists to meet me half-way,'' he said.

Ukrainian exports to Russia fall
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Exports from Ukraine to Russia fell in the first
quarter of 1998 to dlrs 1.7 billion, a news agency reported
Thursday.
	   The figure is down 25 percent from the same period last year,
the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Imports decreased 7 percent, down to dlrs 2.9 billion.
	   Russia's primary export to Ukraine was energy-related, the news
agency said.
	   Even though Russia lifted a stifling value-added tax in
February, Ukrainian goods sold poorly in Russia. Ukrainian
suppliers said that Russian demand for their goods has declined.

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ A bomb exploded Thursday at a crowded
flea market in an Algiers suburb, killing 10 people and injuring
21, a communique from the hospital services said.
	   About 1,000 people were at the market when the bomb went off
about 9 a.m, causing people to run in panic in all directions away
from the market.
	   The explosive apparently was concealed in a shopping basket.
	   The attack came just before a march organized by the Front of
Socialist Forces to protest a law that bans all languages except
Arabic from official use.
	   The Front also wants the government to give official status to
the Tamazight language, which is used by Berbers, who make up about
one-third of Algeria's population.
	   The new law took effect Sunday. It is opposed by the Berber
community, which is still in shock over the murder last month of a
popular Berber singer. Islamic militants claimed responsibility for
that killing.
	   Many Algerians believe the government is seeking to appease
Islamic groups with the Arabic-only language law.
	   The Algerian government has been fighting an Islamic insurgency
since 1992 that has left an estimated 75,000 people dead, mostly in
bombings and massacres.

Yeltsin condemns registration of extremist parties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin criticized his own Justice
Ministry on Thursday for certifying extremist parties and
organizations, a news agency reported.
	   Yeltsin said the Russian constitution prohibits registration of
parties that openly call for the government's ouster, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.
	   The comments were made during a meeting with Justice Minister
Pavel Krasheninnikov.
	   The Russian government has complained recently about the rise of
various extremist groups in Moscow, after repeated attacks by
skinheads on foreigners, as well as synagogues and Jewish
cemeteries.
	   Krasheninnikov himself said recently that Russia must adopt
legislation to cut down on fascism and extremism.
	   More extremists are entering politics, such as the
ultranationalist Russian National Unity paramilitary organization
that plans to run in next year's parliamentary elections.

World Cup: FIFA says Blanc misses final despite French appeal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS Blanc's appearances to 74, 2nd graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ FIFA said Thursday that defender Laurent Blanc will
definitely miss the World Cup final despite any French bid to
appeal his suspension for a red card in the semifinal.
	   The Olympic Marseille star, who has played 74 times for France,
was sent off for the first time in his long career for pushing
Croatian defender Slaven Bilic in the face Wednesday as the two
prepared to chase a free kick.
	   Although they weren't optimistic, French team officials said
they planned to appeal the automatic suspension.
	   But FIFA said that, unless there was a case of mistaken identity
and it wasn't Blanc who committed the offense, there was no chance
of the suspension being dropped.
	   ``A one or two-game ban can't be appealed against,'' said FIFA
spokesman Marius Schneider. ``Only a suspension of three games or
more can be appealed.
	   ``The disciplinary committee doesn't have the power to relieve
him of a suspension for this match.''
	   FIFA regards Blanc's action as violent conduct and has suspended
other players, such as Dutch striker Patrick Kluivert and
Argentina's Ariel Ortega, for more than one game for similar
conduct. Any suspension means Blanc misses Sunday's final against
four-time and defending titlist Brazil at the Stade de France.
	   Blanc was clearly shown to push Bilic in the face after the two
players had tugged each other shirts. The French felt it was a
yellow rather than a red card offense.
	   ``It was unjust, it was too harsh of the referee,'' French coach
Aime Jacquet said of the expulsion.
	   ``We will appeal but we fear it will be a formality. We always
have hope but I don't want to give Blanc any false hope.''
	   Blanc, scorer of the extra time ``Golden Goal'' against Paraguay
that put the French into the quarterfinal, said he wasn't confident
either that a suspension could be avoided.
	   ``It would be a great surprise,'' he said. ``It would be
unique.''
	   But he's still upset.
	   ``My expulsion punishes the player but the really bad scenario
is that it also punishes the team. I have this feeling of having
tasted the cake, but now I'm not allowed to touch the cherry,''
said Blanc.
	   Bilic said that Blanc's red card was all his own fault.
	   ``I didn't get him sent off, he did,'' the Everton defender
said.
	   ``He touched me, technically that's an offense, and the referee
saw it.
	   ``I'm not happy that he's going to miss the final, but if you do
something like that you're going to get punished. That's all there
is to say about it.''

Greek Cypriots to support no-fly zone over island
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HAMZA HENDAWI &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Cyprus supports the creation of a no-fly
zone over the war-divided island to reduce tension, government
spokesman Christos Stylianides said Thursday.
	   The announcement followed discussions Wednesday in Washington
between U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen and his Greek
counterpart, Takis Tsohatozopulos, on ways to ease the conflict in
Cyprus. A non-fly zone was one option considered.
	   Tensions rose significantly over Cyprus last month when
traditional rivals Greece and Turkey sent warplanes to the eastern
Mediterranean island in a show of force.
	   Both NATO partners, the two are the main backers of the island's
Greek and Turkish communities, who have lived apart since Turkey
invaded and occupied the northern third of Cyprus in 1974 after a
short-lived coup in Nicosia by supporters of union with Greece.
	   Cohen on Wednesday said ``it would be a mistake'' for the
government of Greek Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides to deploy
Russian-made S-300 antiaircraft missiles. ``We think it would only
add to tensions, rather than decrease them,'' he said.
	   But Stylianides said the government was ready to accept
proposals for a no-fly zone and that such a move would be ``part of
our common policy and strategy with Greece.''
	   ``Our positions are well known and we will discuss them with
anybody with the aim of demilitarization and disarmament,'' he
said.
	   Turkey has threatened to take military action if necessary to
prevent the deployment of the missiles later this year. But the
Clerides government, the island's only internationally recognized
administration, maintains it will go ahead unless progress is made
on demilitarizing Cyprus or in talks on a settlement.
	   The Greek Cypriot daily Philelephtheros, meanwhile, said
Thursday that U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had sent a
letter to Clerides two weeks ago urging him to reconsider the
purchase of the missiles. She also suggested, according to the
newspaper, that they be stored outside Cyprus or that missiles of a
shorter range be deployed instead.
	   Stylianides confirmed that Albright had written to Clerides and
said the Greek Cypriot leader wrote back, but declined to give
further details.

Swedish gold may have come from Nazi victims, commission says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The tons of gold that Sweden received
in business dealings with Nazi Germany may have included gold
looted from Jews, a commission said Thursday in an interim report
to the government on the sensitive question.
	   However, the commission said, there is no evidence that any of
the gold came from death camps where the Nazis melted down victims'
jewelry and even tooth fillings.
	   The report was part of Sweden's detailed investigation into its
commerce with Germany during World War II, in which Sweden was
neutral. Sweden sold Nazi Germany iron ore, ball bearings and other
supplies critical to its war effort.
	   The trade has been a nagging issue for a country that prides
itself on supporting tolerance and human rights, raising questions
about whether the country's war-era leaders turned a blind eye to
Nazi horrors.
	   ``From today's perspective, it can be established that the moral
aspect should have been considered openly, on a broad basis and
seriously, not later than the summer of 1944,'' commission head
Rolf Wirten said.
	   The commission, which also is investigating whether other Jewish
property including unclaimed bank accounts remains in Sweden, did
not make recommendations on whether the government should consider
restitution for the possibly looted gold.
	   But its strong statement of Sweden's moral responsibility
parallels position of the World Jewish Congress, which was a strong
force in urging Sweden to begin the investigation. In a visit to
Sweden last month WJC leader Israel Singer said a moral accounting
was more important than a fiscal tally.
	   According to the commission, Sweden received 30.4 tons (33.4
avoirdupois tons) of gold from Germany in 1940-1944. Of this, 1.5
tons (1.65 tons) was in gold coins, which could have been obtained
by Germany either by plundering it from Holocaust victims or by
ordering Jews to sell their gold to the Nazi government.
	   After the war, Sweden returned 13.2 tons (14.5 tons) of gold to
Belgium and the Netherlands after determining that it had been
taken by the Nazis from their central banks.
	   Of the remainder, ``the possibility of this quantity of gold
having contained a minor proportion of gold confiscated or
plundered from individuals cannot be excluded,'' the commission
report said.
	   But the commission said it did not intend ``to give the
impression that any exactitude can be achieved'' in determining
whether any of the gold was tainted.
	   The commission, appointed by the government last year, is
expected to give its final report by the end of the year.

<TEXT>
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ Former President Kenneth Kaunda resigned
Thursday as leader of Zambia's biggest opposition party, five weeks
after he was released from house arrest when coup-related charges
against him were dropped.
	   Kaunda's United National Independence Party must now formally
accept the resignation and consider a replacement for the
74-year-old Kaunda. No top candidates have emerged as of yet.
	   ``My intention is to retire from active politics and I handed in
my resignation letter to the Central Committee,'' Kandau told a
press conference. He said the party's Central Committee has
referred the resignation to the party's supreme organ, the National
Council, which is also responsible for choosing a new party leader.
	   Even though Kaunda says he wants out of politics, his voice as
opposition leader was not immediately stilled.
	   During the news conference, Kaunda announced the United National
Independence Party would contest upcoming local elections. A date
for the vote has not been set yet. He also demanded a new electoral
supervisory commission be appointed, claiming the existing one was
dominated by members of President Frederik Chiluba's Movement for
Multi-Party Democracy.
	   Kaunda's party boycotted the 1996 general elections, claiming
they were unfair.
	   Kaunda was arrested on Christmas Day on allegations of plotting
a coup attempt last October against Chiluba. He was ultimately
charged with knowing about the coup plot but failing to notify
authorities. He was released from house arrest on June 1 when all
charges were dropped.
	   The treason trial of 77 soldiers and two politicians charged
with plotting the Oct. 28 coup is ongoing. The coup, mounted by
junior army officers, was quickly quelled by loyal troops.
	   Kaunda ruled Zambia from 1964 independence to the country's
first multi-party elections in 1991, which he lost to Chiluba.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with protests from small center-right parties &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The Social Democrats, who came
first in last month's elections, signed an agreement with a rival
party on Thursday that would allow them to form a minority
government.
	   Social Democratic leader Milos Zeman was to meet later Thursday
with President Vaclav Havel, who was expected to designate him as
prime minister.
	   But protests from two small center-right parties, the Freedom
Union and the Christian Democrats, who complain the agreement is
unconstitutional, may delay Havel's decision to appoint Zeman as
premier.
	   Christian Democrat Josef Lux traveled to the presidential
residence in Lany outside Prague to protest the agreement.
	   ``We asked the president to reject that agreement,'' Lux told
Czech radio after the meeting.
	   Lux and leader of the Freedom Union, Jan Ruml, say the agreement
violates the constitution by eliminating the influence of small
parties in the parliament.
	   Under the agreement, former Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus's Civic
Democratic Party will allow Zeman's Social Democrats to form a
single-party minority government by not voting against them in
Parliament.
	   In exchange, Klaus' party will be allowed to appoint the
speakers of both chambers of Parliament and the chairmen of key
parliamentary committees.
	   Both parties also agreed not to initiate a non-confidence vote
during the lower chamber's four-year term and not to dissolve the
chamber before the term's end.
	   Each side also promised not to form a coalition or an alliance
with a third party to the detriment of each other's party.
	   The agreement is expected to boost the power of the two largest
political parties, putting pressure on parliament's three smaller
groups - the Christian Democrats, Freedom Union and unreformed
Communists.
	   ``Today, I completed my mission given to me by the president,''
Zeman said after signing ceremony Thursday morning. ``This
afternoon, I will hand him this agreement as a result of the
mission.''
	   ``It is possible that the president ... will take a few days to
think how to deal with this issue,'' Havel's adviser Jiri Pehe was
quoted as saying.
	   Both Zeman and Klaus stress that the agreement is not a
coalition agreement.
	   ``By this agreement, the Civic Democratic Party moves into
opposition,'' Klaus said, adding his party still remains a
``political rival of the Social Democrats.''
	   Zeman's center-left party won 74 of the 200 parliamentary seats
in the June 19-20 elections, Klaus' Civic Democrats finished second
with 63 seats.
	   After coalition talks with two small center-right parties - the
Christian Democrats and the Freedom Union - failed, Zeman settled
on Klaus, his archrival.

diplomatic blow in the General Assembly earlier this week, is
trying to head off an Arab-sponsored resolution in the Security
Council that would condemn Israel for trying to expand Jerusalem.
	   U.S. and Arab representatives met Wednesday night to try to work
out a compromise, and proposals were being sent to Washington and
other capitals to see what leverage negotiators could offer,
diplomatic sources said Thursday.
	   Both sides were trying to find common ground on a presidential
statement, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Such a statement doesn't carry the weight of international law that
a resolution does.
	   No vote has been scheduled.
	   An Arab-sponsored draft resolution would condemn the June 21
decision by the Israeli cabinet and demand it be rescinded. The
decision called for the extension of Jerusalem's boundaries to
include several towns and the expansion of some municipal services
from Jerusalem to West Bank settlements.
	   Washington has argued that the move would inflame passions and
hinder U.S. diplomatic efforts to revive the stalled Middle East
peace process.
	   The United States used the same argument unsuccessfully on
Tuesday when the General Assembly voted overwhelmingly to give more
rights and privileges to the Palestinian observer mission.
	   The assembly voted 124-4 to enhance the Palestinians' role to
that just short of a member state. Ten countries abstained.
	   U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson called the symbolic move ``the
wrong resolution at the wrong time.''

Mubarak defies U.N. embargo to fly to Libya
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Mubarak's return grafs 1 and 2, no pickup

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak violated a
U.N. air embargo Thursday by flying to Libya to meet Col. Moammar
Gadhafi.
	   Mubarak, accompanied by several ministers and aides, returned a
few hours later, repeating the breach of the embargo, which bans
direct flights to and from Libya.
	   Mubarak is the most senior world leader to defy the air embargo,
which was imposed in 1992 after Gadhafi refused to hand over two
Libyans suspected in the 1988 bombing of an American airliner over
Lockerbie, Scotland that killed 270 people.
	   Mubarak flew from Cairo to Al-Abrak town, 60 kilometers (37
miles) from the northern seaside town of Al-Bayda, Libyan
television said.
	   ``President Hosni Mubarak arrived aboard an Egyptian plane at
Al-Abrak civilian airport,'' a commentator on Libyan television
said in a live broadcast from Al-Abrak where Libyan officials gave
Mubarak a red carpet welcome.
	   Mubarak's visit was not announced and Egypt's official Middle
East News Agency only reported his arrival in Libya at about the
same time Libyan television started its live broadcast.
	   The broadcast was monitored in Cairo.
	   From Al-Abrak, Mubarak drove to Al-Bayda where he met with
Gadhafi who is recovering from a surgery to repair a hip bone he
broke on Monday while exercising. Al-Bayda is 1,400 kilometers (865
miles) east of Tripoli, the Libyan capital.
	   The state Libyan television showed Mubarak shaking hands with
Gadhafi who sat on a wheel chair dressed in a golden brown
traditional Libyan gown. Mubarak also kissed Gadhafi on both cheeks
and inquired about his health.
	   Large crowds of Libyans greeted Mubarak on his arrival at the
Al-Abrak airport, the television said.
	   No reason was given for the visit, but Mubarak was believed to
have gone to Libya to wish Gadhafi a speedy recovery after his
surgery.
	   During their meeting, Gadhafi's doctors showed Mubarak three
X-rays of the broken hip.
	   Since the surgery on Monday, Gadhafi, 56, is reported to be in
good condition and resumed normal work on Wednesday, the Libyan
official news agency JANA said. Gadhafi's surgery was broadcast by
Libyan television on Tuesday.
	   Mubarak has visited Libya many times since 1992 but has always
driven across the Egyptian-Libyan border.
	   Last month, the Organization of African Unity urged member
states to ignore the sanctions for visits with humanitarian and
religious implications or those relating to official OAU work.
	   But until Thursday's flight by Mubarak, only Chad and Niger had
heeded the call, and Gadhafi twice canceled a visit to Egypt last
month, apparently angered by Egypt's refusal to let him fly to
Cairo.
	   Libya recently launched a campaign to win wider support from the
22-nation Arab League to lift the U.N. embargo. In September 1997,
the League had urged member states to ``take steps to ease the
toughness of the sanctions.''

	   LONDON (AP) _ Brazil is the odds-on favorite of bookies to win
the a fifth World Cup against France.
	   The defending champions were set at 4-to-6 picks Thursday by
Ladbroke's, the largest of Britain's legal betting houses.
	   France is ranked a 6-5 chance to win its first Cup.
	   Ladbrokes said odds for the team winning in normal time were 5-4
for Brazil, 2-1 for France and 15-8 for a draw.
	   Ladbrokes spokesman Sean Boyce said Brazil and France had been
favorites in the betting since 1994.
	   ``For many this is the dream final of the hosts playing the
defending champions _ as it is, we'll be facing a big payout come
Sunday,'' he said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ It worked so well in 1994, Brazil is positive it
will work again.
	   The defending World Cup champions were scheduled to meet
Thursday night with Evandro Motta, a specialist in success
psychology.
	   FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said Motta would address the team on
``mastering positive energy which, in turn, creates success.''
	   Motta met with the team before the '94 championship in Pasadena,
California, where Brazil won its record fourth title in a shootout
over Italy.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ Whatever you do, don't get up to get a beer during
the 75th minute of Sunday's championship. You'll miss the best
chance of seeing a goal.
	   FIFA said twice as many goals _ 35 _ have been scored in the
75th minute of World Cup than at any other time in the matches.
	   There have been 1,749 goals in World Cup games since 1930, and
alot of them came late in the games. FIFA statistics showed 20.1
percent of all scoring occurred in the last 15 minutes play.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP ) _ Ejections are up, warnings are down compared with
the last World Cup.
	   Laurent Blanc's ejection in Wednesday night's semifinal between
France and Croatia was the 21st red card of the tournament, an
average of .33 per game. In 1994, games averaged .29 ejections.
	   Warning, or yellow, cards have been shown 241 times, an average
of 3.9 a match or a half-card less than four years ago.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP _ World Cup organizers said Thursday that attendence
was right where they thought it would be _ a full calendar of full
houses.
	   Committee spokesman Bruno Travade said attendence through
Wednesday night's France-Croatia semifinal was a capacity 2.5
million. Another 112,000 fans will watch the third-place game
Saturday at Parc des Princes and the championship Sunday at Stade
de France, he said.
	   Ticket revenues met the organizer's budget of dlrs 233 million,
Travade said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Brazilian priests at a religious gathering
believe the Virgin of Guadalupe intervened in a World Cup victory.
	   The Brazilian priests are attending a weeklong meeting of 4,000
Roman Catholic priests from five continents being held at the
Basilica of Guadalupe, Mexico's holiest shrine.
	   During sessions Wednesday, the priests draped Brazil's flag on a
wall after the team advanced to the World Cup finals with a win
Tuesday against the Netherlands.
	   ``The intervention of the Virgin of Guadalupe in the soccer game
gave the team its victory,'' an unnamed Brazilian priest was quoted
by the local newspaper Reforma.
	   The Virgin of Guadalupe is Mexico's patron saint, an apparition
of the Virgin Mary on a hillside just outside Mexico City in 1531.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Although Vietnam never has advanced to the
World Cup finals, soccer is by far the top sport in the country.
	   Vietnamese have been mesmerized by broadcasts of the tournament
in France, even though some matches are shown live at 2 a.m. local
time.
	   Partly in recognition of Vietnam's interest in soccer, the
eight-nation Tiger Cup will be staged in the country Aug. 26-Sept.
5.
	   The competition was to have been held in Indonesia, but economic
and political turmoil led the Asian Football Federation to seek a
new site. Malaysia was then offered the tournament, but declined
because it will be busy with the Commonwealth Games.
	   With government backing, the Vietnam Football Association then
got the nod and will stage the tournament in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh
City.
	   The countries fielding teams are Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar,
Indonesia, Singapore, Laos, Vietnam and the Philippines.

Experts reject global strategy to phase out CFC-driven inhalers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A U.N.-sponsored meeting Thursday called on
nations to find their own ways of cutting out ozone-damaging gases
used in inhalers and firefighting equipment.
	   Some 300 experts from 97 countries decided against a global
strategy to phase out inhalers driven by chlorofluorocarbon gases,
linked to the shrinking of the planet's protective ozone layer.
	   They also said countries should develop appropriate plans to cut
emissions of halon, still used to fight fires although no longer
produced.
	   Countries shouldn't push too hard to phase out CFCs in uses such
as inhalers, which cause relatively little environmental damage,
cautioned Vishwanath Anand of India's Environment Ministry.
	   Such a move could push up health costs for thousands of people
suffering asthma in developing countries, he told a news
conference. Only one inhaler is currently available without CFCs.
	   The three-day Geneva gathering prepared the way for a November
meeting in Cairo of parties to the Montreal Protocol, signed by
some 160 nations.
	   The protocol banned the production and import of CFCs in
developed countries, and gave developing nations until 2010 to
phase them out. They must start doing so next year.
	   Some East European countries which signed up as industrialized
nations have too few resources to comply fully in the wake of this
decade's economic troubles, said Finnish official Jukka Uosukainen.
	   A U.N. assessment last month said the gases and other chemicals
are entering the atmosphere at a slower rate, but it could be 20
years before ozone levels recover noticeably. It said they should
return to their pre-1980s levels around the middle of the next
century.
	   Although CFC concentrations in the atmosphere have started to
decline, halon levels continue to rise. The gases' long lifespan
means that reduction will be slow.

out to check battle zone
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Albanians reporting shelling Serbs
reportedly failing to drive ethnic Albanians from border positions &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian militants brushed
aside the latest call to stop their fight for an independent Kosovo
and claimed Serb forces Thursday shelled villages near the Albanian
border.
	   Elsewhere, international observers fanned out across the
rebellious Serb province Thursday for a first-hand look at battle
zones.
	   In western Kosovo, ethnic Albanian fighters held their ground a
few kilometers (miles) from the Albanian border. Their deputy
commander, Gani Shehu, told a reporter Thursday that Serb police
failed to dislodge the guerrillas in two days of attacks which
ended Wednesday night.
	   The United States and European countries trying to stop the
fighting in the Serbian province demanded an immediate cease-fire
Wednesday and for the first time called on governments to crack
down on the flow of funds to the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   But the latest cease-fire call, issued by the six-nation Contact
Group in Bonn, Germany, appeared to have little effect on the
militants.
	   In Geneva, Switzerland, the Popular Movement of Kosovo, which
claims to bankroll the KLA, said nothing short of independence
would satisfy the guerrillas.
	   Spokesman Mahmuti Bardhyl said the KLA would agree to a
cease-fire only if the Serbs withdrew all armed units from the
province, where Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
	   That message was repeated by Naim Maloku, a top KLA commander in
western Kosovo. Maloku said in an interview published Thursday by
the Albanian language daily Koha Ditore that Kosovo Albanians had
no choice but to fight for what they consider their rights.
	   ``The war has been imposed on us,'' Maloku said. ``We had no
other way out.''
	   He also rejected calls by the Contact Group _ the United States,
Russia, Britain, France, Germany and Italy _ for the KLA to accept
the leadership of the province's leading non-violent Albanian
politician, Ibrahim Rugova.
	   The Contact Group wants the KLA to allow Rugova to negotiate the
future of the province with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
Kosovo is a province of Serbia, which together with Montenegro
forms Yugoslavia.
	   ``For nine years, Rugova has been calling for dialogue,'' Maloku
saaid. ``We call for dialogue and the Serbs respond with
repression.''
	   As part of the international campaign to curb the crisis,
observers from the United States, Russia, the Netherlands, Belgium
and Britain left Pristina on Thursday for a first-hand look at
areas of recent fighting.
	   The observers -- driving in bullet-proof cars and wearing flack
jackets -- barred reporters from the tour.
	   It was unclear whether the observers would try to visit Morina,
a border town 90 kilometers (56 miles) southwest of here, where
ethnic Albanian sources reported a strong Serb attack Wednesday in
an apparent bid to cut supply lines to Albania.
	   In a village about five kilometers (three miles) from Morina,
Shehu said KLA fighters were still holding their positions Thursday
although strong Serb attacks over the past two days had left ``many
dead'' on both sides.
	   The area appeared quiet Thursday. There were no reports from
Serb sources in the area.
	   The Albanian Kosovo Information Center also claimed government
forces shelled several villages late Wednesday and Thursday near
Djakovica, about 75 kilometers (47 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   There were no reports of casualties and no confirmation from
independent sources.
	   In neighboring Albania, President Rexhep Mejdani appealed for an
``international presence'' in Kosovo. Mejdani told visiting German
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel that such a presence would reduce
violence and open the way for a diplomatic solution.
	   Kinkel visited the Albanian border town of Bajram Curri on
Thursday to meet with Kosovo Albanians who fled there to escape
fighting. Afterward, he told reporters in the Albanian capital
Tirana that major powers would never accept an independent Kosovo.
	   He also said the Europeans were considering ``how to help
Albania stop the arms smuggling'' across the border into Kosovo. He
did not elaborate but added that ``everything must be done to stop
the violence.''

Police battle Nigerian demonstrators; junta to discuss transition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with three grafs to UPDATE with other clashes in
Lagos.UPDATES with military junta planning to meet to discuss
handover to civilian rule. &QL; 
 &UR; By FRANK AIGBOGUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Black smoke billowed up over a large
market in central Lagos on Thursday from a blaze police say was set
by youths enraged at the death of the country's leading political
prisoner, Moshood Abiola.
	   Although parts of Lagos were calm after two tumultuous days, the
fire at the Agege Market _ and clashes between demonstrators and
police in three other parts of Lagos _ warned that life in Nigeria
was far from returning to normal.
	   Police and firefighters battled the blaze that started
mid-morning in several market stalls. Several houses were
reportedly also set alight by marauding groups of youths.
	   The country's ruling military junta was preparing to meet
Thursday to discuss plans to hand over power to civilians and
release Nigeria's remaining political prisoners.
	   The military's Provisional Ruling Council was also to discuss
the fate of several people convicted earlier this year of plotting
a coup against the late dictator Gen. Sani Abacha.
	   Nigeria's former deputy ruler Gen. Oladipo Diya and five others
were sentenced to die by firing squad in connection with the
alleged coup plot.
	   The junta was under fire after the death of Abiola, Nigeria's
best-known political prisoner, who died on Tuesday.
	   Abiola, the man many hoped would become the next civilian
president of Africa's most populous nation, died Tuesday after
falling ill during a meeting with visiting U.S. dignitaries.
	   The government says he died of a heart attack, but authorities
plan an autopsy. The procedure may be performed Thursday, a
relative of Abiola said on condition of anonymity.
	   Rioters on Wednesday tore through parts of the commercial
capital of Lagos, the southern university town of Ibadan and
Abiola's hometown of Abeokuta. At least 19 people were killed in
the violence.
	   Police used tear gas to quell the violence that began to ebb
Wednesday evening.
	   Many people in Lagos stayed home. The smoldering ruins of the
mayhem, piles of burning tires, were left along street corners.
	   On Wednesday, Nigeria's new military leader added to the
confusion situation by dissolving his Cabinet. However, Gen.
Abdulsalam Abubakar left untouched the country's Provisional Ruling
Council, the core of the junta that rules this oil-rich but
poverty-wracked nation.
	   He had inherited the Cabinet from dictator Gen. Sani Abacha. who
died June 8 of a heart attack.
	   Abubakar, in a nationwide television address Wednesday night,
called the death of Moshood Abiola a ``national tragedy'' and
appealed for calm.
	   ``Our national grief cannot be assuaged by recourse to
lawlessness,'' he said.
	   He made no mention of his plans for the Cabinet, though he said
that returning Nigeria to democracy was imperative.
	   Abiola, the apparent winner of 1993 presidential elections later
annulled by the military leadership, had been in prison since 1994.
He died Tuesday after suddenly falling ill during a meeting with
U.S. diplomats who were appealing for his freedom. He was 60.
	   A potent symbol of reform for Nigeria's poor masses, Abiola was
enormously popular in Nigeria's southwest, home of his Yoruba
ethnic group, where a growing number of people are blaming the
military for his death. The government said Abiola died of a heart
attack.
	   Col. Mohammed Marwa, the popular military administrator of Lagos
state, appealed for calm in an afternoon radio broadcast on
Wednesday.
	   ``Violence will not profit anyone,'' he said, adding: ``Only God
knows why He has taken Abiola away at this crucial period of
national reconciliation.''
	   Some of the violence was ethnic-based, with Yorubas from
Nigeria's southwest attacking Hausas. Hausas and Fulanis, both from
the north, make up a majority in the military and the junta.
	   While Abiola reportedly had been very ill last year, his death
came as a surprise, just days after U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan announced that all Nigeria's political prisoners would be
freed, including Abiola.
	   The U.S. State Department said there was no reason to believe
that Abiola's death was from anything other than natural causes.
	   But Abiola's family was suspicious, jaded by the oppressiveness
of the Abacha years.
	   Abubakar said in his speech that an autopsy would be conducted
in cooperation with the Abiola family, and that pathologists were
being flown in from the United States, Canada and the United
Kingdom.

Pakistan husbands foreign exchange while waiting for IMF

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan announced Thursday that it
is conserving its foreign exchange reserves, while it waits for the
International Monetary Fund to decide whether it can release money
and stave off a looming financial crisis.
	   The announcement was made at a joint press conference by IMF
director Paul Chabrier and Pakistan's Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz.
The IMF director ended two days of meetings in Pakistan.
	   Chabrier said he listened to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif explain
why his country was forced to explode six nuclear devices in
response to neighboring India, and why it was ``unfair'' to punish
both nations for a crisis instigated by one _ India.
	   After India and Pakistan exploded the nuclear devices in May,
the world's leading industrialized nations announced punishing
sanctions.
	   Included in the sanctions were contributions to the IMF and
other international lending institutions like the World Bank and
the Asian Development Bank.
	   For Pakistan that means an automatic loss of about dlrs 1.5
billion. For India it translates into a loss of about dlrs 3
billion.
	   For Pakistan the sanctions are devastating. If they stay in
place, it is certain that this country will not be able to make its
payments on a dlrs 30 billion debt, said Aziz. That leaves open the
possibility of either declaring a moratorium on repayment or an
outright default.
	   The problem is an immediate one. On Wednesday, Aziz said
Pakistan needs an answer within three weeks. It has barely dlrs 800
million remaining in its foreign exchange reserves, enough to pay
for six weeks of imports.
	   Aziz said Pakistan will try to reduce its imports and conserve
its reserves, taking a careful look at all its outstanding bills.
It will defer any dollar payment it can, a decision that will be
taken by the State Bank of Pakistan.
	   Aziz also said the State Bank of Pakistan will no longer provide
foreign exchange at official rates to Pakistanis traveling outside
the country.
	   Chabrier said Pakistan's leaders know the financial difficulties
that lie ahead.
	   ``It is a situation of great uncertainty,'' he said.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Orthodox church leaders called Thursday
for millions of dollars in missing money to be accounted for as
part of an ongoing investigation into the church's mysterious and
allegedly mismanaged finances.
	   An internal investigation that has lasted more than a year has
brought to light the literally Byzantine manner in which the
church's vast fortune is managed.
	   Archbishop Christodoulos, who took office in April, is using the
battle against negligence and embezzlement to show he's serious
about giving the Greek Orthodox Church a new image.
	   But the 450-page document detailing crimes from mismanagement to
theft from 1988 to 1996 has rekindled an old debate about the
church's untouchable status. Church leaders wield considerable
influence and often are more popular than political leaders.
	   A prosecutor is looking into the findings, and pressure is
mounting to make the report public. There also has been some
grumbling in Parliament that the church has been allowed to keep
its financial matters under wraps for too long.
	   Although so far only lay employees been implicated, the bishops
and metropolitans who supervise them will be held accountable,
church leaders said.
	   ``Clergy supervised lay employees and certainly are responsible
for being extremely negligent,'' said Metropolitan Maximos of
Serres, who spoke for the Holy Synod during its three-day meeting
about the financial report.
	   After the Holy Synod met Thursday, Church leaders said they had
asked two private citizens to return dlrs 2 million withdrawn from
church accounts.
	   Lay employees were given until Friday to return tens of
thousands of dollars more in missing or embezzled money.
	   ``No matter how much these findings may hurt the church, they
are beneficial,'' said Father Ignatius, a spokesman for the church.
``This investigation will create conditions so that such things
don't happen again.''
	   But many are wondering how deep the church is willing to cut to
remove financial corruption. The Orthodox Church is the largest
landowner in Greece and enjoys tax-free status.
	   The state pays the salaries of the country's 12,000 clerics and
gives large grants to restore monasteries and churches.
	   Estimates place the church's fortune _ which it won't reveal _
at about dlrs 1 billion.
	   ``There is no control,'' said Nitsa Loule, a leftist
Parliamentary deputy. ``No one oversees their budget, or how they
spend their money.''
	   Alleged scandals range from renovation grants spent for other
purposes to vast embezzlement schemes involving church property
leased in complicated scams.
	   Politicians recently backed off an a proposal to
constitutionally separate church and state. Orthodoxy is Greece's
official religion and more than 90 percent of the country is
baptized in the church.
	   A full conference of Greece's 80 bishops will meet in October
after examining the report. Afterwards, it may file criminal
charges.
	   For critics such as Loule, that's not enough.
	   ``Independent commissions should oversee all the church's
economics,'' she said. ``The church has enough money. They should
pay their own salaries.''

Earthquake strikes Azores Islands, killing nine

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ An earthquake shook Portugal's Azores
Islands in the Atlantic Ocean just before dawn Thursday, killing
nine people and leaving some 1,000 people homeless.
	   The quake's magnitude was 5.8 and had its epicenter at sea, 15
kilometers (10 miles) northeast of Faial, one of the group's nine
volcanic islands, a spokesman for Portugal's National Seismological
Institute said.
	   By 2 p.m (1300 GMT), the death toll stood at nine, all of them
on Faial, according to Helena Vaz, spokeswoman for the Azores Civil
Protection Service. About 90 people on the island were injured, one
seriously.
	   The tremor also caused damage to buildings on the nearby islands
of Pico and Sao Jorge, but no injuries were reported there.
	   Vaz said the rescue services were not expecting to find any more
bodies in the rubble of houses which collapsed on Faial.
	   ``We've reached all areas of the island. Local people have not
reported anyone else missing,'' she said by telephone.
	   Roads were cut off and bridges caved in, forcing rescue crews to
use two Portuguese Air Force Puma helicopters to reach remote
villages, she said. Faial has a population of about 5,000.
	   The quake was felt at 5:19 a.m. (0519 GMT) on four of the nine
Azores Islands which lie 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) west of
Portugal, officials said.
	   Residents said the quake lasted between 15 and 20 seconds and
was followed by a series of minor aftershocks.
	   Portuguese state television RTP showed images filmed in the
small Faial village of Ribeirinha of families standing about in
their nightwear in the bright morning sunshine surveying the damage
done to their houses and cars.
	   An Air Force C-130 transport plane carrying emergency aid left
Lisbon in the afternoon for the three-hour flight to the
archipelago.
	   The plane was taking sniffer dogs, medical teams, electricity
generators, rescue experts, 2,000 blankets and 160 army tents with
capacity for about 1,000 people, Antonio Capinha, a spokesman for
the Internal Affairs Ministry, said.
	   Prime Minister Antonio Guterres canceled a weekend vacation with
Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar to fly to the Azores.
	   The archipelago has a total population of about 250,000, most of
whom make their living from agriculture and fishing.
	   The islands have been hit by earthquakes in the past, with 49
people killed and some 300 injured in one of the worst tremors in
1980.

Prosecutors investigate more than 10,000 bad loans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Prosecutors investigating Bulgaria's
economic crash a year ago are looking into more than 10,000 bad
loans worth 1.6 billion dollars, the general prosecutor announced
Thursday.
	   The cases include loans made by 41 state and private banks to
firms and individuals, Prosecutor General Ivan Tatarchev said.
	   ``Bank executives have allowed loans without any control,
without the necessary guarantees and collateral,'' Tatarchev told
the state news agency BTA.
	   The prosecution is acting on a report on bad loans published
earlier this year by the central bank.
	   While some of the money has been used to keep inefficient state
companies going, much is suspected to have been embezzled under
former governments controlled by ex-communists.
	   One of Europe's poorest countries, Bulgaria owes dlrs 9 billion
in foreign debt. The average salary in the country of 8.2 million
is the equivalent of less than dlrs 100 a month.
	   Lax financial policies and foot-dragging on market reforms
resulted in hyperinflation in early 1997 that unleashed mass street
protests and forced the Socialist government of former communists
to resign.
	   The present government has imposed tight financial discipline
and pledged to prosecute those responsible for the economic
collapse.

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ With one engine on fire, an
American Airlines jet made an emergency landing at San Juan's
international airport Thursday.
	   Two passengers were treated for injuries after the plane landed
and firefighters extinguished the flames, said Mari Tere Pacheco of
the Puerto Rico Civil Defense. He had no details.
	   Officials could not immediately say how many passengers were
aboard nor give the origin of the Boeing 727, which they said had
been headed for San Juan.
	   A spokeswoman at American Airlines headquarters in Fort Worth,
Texas, said they were gathering information.

Reports: Russia's Gazprom to spin off assets, pay taxes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian natural gas giant Gazprom plans to
spin off its non-core assets, sell stakes to investors, and is
working on a plan to pay off all its back taxes, Russian news
agencies reported Thursday.
	   Just how much those taxes amount to, however, remains a
question.
	   A week ago, the government threatened to seize Gazprom's assets
if it didn't pay its tax arrears at once. Later, the government
eased its demands and gave Gazprom until Aug. 2 to figure out the
exact amount of unpaid taxes.
	   Gazprom is the largest of the country's ``natural monopolies''
as well as its largest tax debtor. It is the world's largest gas
company.
	   Alexander Semenyaka, a member of the board of Gazprom, said the
company hopes to raise more than 100 million rubles (dlrs 16.6
million) from the sale of cars, hotels and other recreational
amenities.
	   The properties are a vestige of the company's Soviet past, when,
like other government ministries, it operated a broad range of
facilities, including farms and hospitals.
	   Semenyaka also confirmed plans to raise dlrs 2 billion by
selling an unspecified number of shares later this year to Italian
oil concern ENI and Royal-Dutch Shell. The company has long planned
such a sale, but has been forced to postpone it because of market
volatility.
	   Semenyaka said the company paid 3.3 billion rubles (dlrs 550
million) to cover its June taxes, 900 million rubles (dlrs 150
million) short of what the government says it owes.
	   Semenyaka said the company is still negotiating the June bill,
and is determined to pay its July taxes by the end of the month.
	   Last week, Russia's tax chief, Boris Fyodorov, said Gazprom's
total debts to the budget as of July 1 were 6.4 billion rubles
(dlrs 1 billion), not counting penalties for late payments.
	   While the government acknowledged that various federal agencies
also owe money to Gazprom, the accurate figures are still a matter
of discussion.

Official: Jordan should clear mines quicker, sign ban treaty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan should swiftly clear 185,000 land
mines buried during its wars with Israel and sign a global mine ban
treaty, a mine expert said on Thursday.
	   ``We would like to see Jordan move beyond the rhetoric, to
accelerate its work to clear mines and help the victims and most
importantly to sign the mine ban treaty,'' said Jerry White,
executive director of the private Landmine Survivors Network.
	   The Mine Ban Treaty, reached in Ottawa, Canada, in December
1997, prohibits the use, production, stockpiling and transferring
of anti-personal land mines. More than 120 countries worldwide
signed it, but only 10 have ratified it.
	   White declined to say why he thought that Jordan was hesitant to
clear its mines, many of them planted along the border with Israel
following the 1967 Middle East War.
	   Government officials were not immediately available for comment.
	   But White's assistant, Kamel Saadi, said Jordan has cleared
65,000 mines in the last five years. The slow pace is believed to
be caused by the lack of equipment to do the job, he said.
	   ``I feel the will is there, but the need for assistance is also
there too,'' added Saadi, 34, a Jordanian who lost his left leg in
a mine blast near the Israeli border 20 years ago.
	   White's organization, which is based in Washington, provides
assistance to mine survivors worldwide. It plans a two-day
discussion here starting Saturday on ways to rehabilitate mine
survivors in the Arab world.
	   Saadi said of the 300,000 mine victims worldwide, 30 percent are
Arabs. He declined to say how many were Jordanians.
	   White and Saadi said U.N. statistics show that Arab and Muslim
states are the ``most heavily mined'' in the world, possessing more
than 50 percent of the estimated 100 million mines worldwide.
	   In the region, Egypt is the most mined, with more than 20
million planted since World War I. Iraq was second with 10 million
mines, Saadi said.

Two British navy ships to visit Syria next week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ The coming visit by two Royal Navy ships
to a Syrian port will improve military relations between Britain
and Syria, the British ambassador to Syria said Thursday.
	   The ships' docking in Latakia, scheduled for July 17, will be
the first contact between the two states' armed forces since
Britain broke diplomatic relations with Syria over an attempt to
blow up an Israeli airliner flying from London in 1986.
	   It will also be the first time the Royal Navy has called on
Syria in 48 years.
	   ``We hope that the visit will re-establish the relationship of
easy partnership between the armed forces of our countries,''
Ambassador Basil Eastwood said at a news conference in Damascus.
	   Britain's decision to send the ships to Latakia ``symbolize our
national determination to build a relationship of partnership
between Syria and the United Kingdom,'' Eastwood added.
	   Asked if the visit heralds the development of military relations
between the two countries, Eastwood said: ``We cannot get into
details about this ... We are at the beginning of the process and
we hope that in the course of this visit there can be some joint
activities between the British and the Syrian navies.''
	   ``We have tentative plans to have joint activities between
Syrian and British frogmen,'' he said.
	   Britain restored diplomatic relations with Syria in 1991.

U.S. envoy Talbott hold talks with India on nuclear issue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ U.S. and Indian representatives held
talks Thursday on nuclear weapons, the second attempt to ease
relations strained since India set off a series of underground
nuclear tests in May.
	   No details were released about the meeting between U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and his counterpart from India,
Jaswant Singh. The two met in Washington last month.
	   The U.S. government cut off aid and loans to India after its
nuclear tests and called on New Delhi to sign the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty. Other countries also criticized the tests and
imposed sanctions.
	   India's neighbor, Pakistan, responded to the tests by carrying
out its own, raising fears that their 50-year standoff could start
a nuclear war.
	   Indian politicians have long criticized the test ban treaty as
leaving the traditional nuclear powers _ Britain, China, France,
Russia and the United States _ at a technological advantage after
carrying out tests for decades.
	   But India's Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said after the
tests that he could consider signing some form of the treaty, which
many arms control experts want as a first step toward eliminating
all nuclear weapons.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton had been planning to travel to India
in November, and the outcome of Talbott's meetings with Singh,
which are expected to continue in New Delhi next month, may decide
whether the trip is still on.
	   Talbott's spokesman, Tom Dougherty, said Assistant Secretary of
State Karl F. Indefurth also attended the meeting.

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ With one engine on fire, an
American Airlines jet made an emergency landing at San Juan's
airport Thursday.
	   Three or four of the 242 passengers were treated for slight
injuries incurred as they escaped down emergency slides, an airline
spokesman said.
	   The left engine of Flight 574, an Airbus A300 on its way to
Miami, burst into flames soon after taking off from San Juan's Luis
Munoz Marin International Airport, spokesman John Hotard said from
the airline's headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas.
	   ``The captain returned to the airport, landed about two-thirds
down the runway, pulled the slides and evacuated,'' he said.
	   Nine crew members accompanied the 242 passengers.
	   Earlier, Puerto Rico's Civil Defense reported the aircraft was a
Boeing 727 on its way to San Juan. Hotard said initial reports had
wrongly identified Flight 465 coming to San Juan from Miami.

Investigation into church's finances chips away at secrecy

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Orthodox church leaders called Thursday
for millions of dollars in missing money to be accounted for as
part of an ongoing investigation into the church's mysterious and
allegedly mismanaged finances.
	   An internal investigation that has lasted more than a year has
brought to light the literally Byzantine manner in which the
church's vast fortune is managed.
	   Archbishop Christodoulos, who took office in April, is using the
battle against negligence and embezzlement to show he's serious
about giving the Greek Orthodox Church a new image.
	   But the 450-page document detailing crimes from mismanagement to
theft from 1988 to 1996 has rekindled an old debate about the
church's untouchable status. Church leaders wield considerable
influence and often are more popular than political leaders.
	   A prosecutor is looking into the findings, and pressure is
mounting to make the report public. There also has been some
grumbling in Parliament that the church has been allowed to keep
its financial matters under wraps for too long.
	   Although so far only lay employees been implicated, the bishops
and metropolitans who supervise them will be held accountable,
church leaders said.
	   ``Clergy supervised lay employees and certainly are responsible
for being extremely negligent,'' said Metropolitan Maximos of
Serres, who spoke for the Holy Synod during its three-day meeting
about the financial report.
	   After the Holy Synod met Thursday, Church leaders said they had
asked two private citizens to return dlrs 2 million withdrawn from
church accounts.
	   Lay employees were given until Friday to return tens of
thousands of dollars more in missing or embezzled money.
	   ``No matter how much these findings may hurt the church, they
are beneficial,'' said Father Ignatius, a spokesman for the church.
``This investigation will create conditions so that such things
don't happen again.''
	   But many are wondering how deep the church is willing to cut to
remove financial corruption. The Orthodox Church is the largest
landowner in Greece and enjoys tax-free status.
	   The state pays the salaries of the country's 12,000 clerics and
gives large grants to restore monasteries and churches.
	   Estimates place the church's fortune _ which it won't reveal _
at about dlrs 1 billion.
	   ``There is no control,'' said Nitsa Loule, a leftist
Parliamentary deputy. ``No one oversees their budget, or how they
spend their money.''
	   Alleged scandals range from renovation grants spent for other
purposes to vast embezzlement schemes involving church property
leased in complicated scams.
	   Politicians recently backed off an a proposal to
constitutionally separate church and state. Orthodoxy is Greece's
official religion and more than 90 percent of the country is
baptized in the church.
	   A full conference of Greece's 80 bishops will meet in October
after examining the report. Afterwards, it may file criminal
charges.
	   For critics such as Loule, that's not enough.
	   ``Independent commissions should oversee all the church's
economics,'' she said. ``The church has enough money. They should
pay their own salaries.''

Prince William meets Camilla Parker Bowles for the first time
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS; UPDATES with palace confirms meeting; new detail
and info throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ For the first time, Prince William has met Camilla
Parker Bowles, his father's longtime flame and the woman his
mother, Princess Diana, blamed for the breakup of their marriage,
Prince Charles' office confirmed Thursday.
	   In an unusual move, a spokeswoman at Charles' London residence,
St. James's Palace confirmed a report of the meeting in The Sun
newspaper _ including that the tabloid had held up the story for 24
hours so that Charles could talk to 16-year-old William about it.
	   ``Basically, we can confirm that, yes, it is true, they have
met,'' said a spokeswoman at St. James's, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   The Sun, in a story which St. James's palace did not dispute,
said the June 12 meeting happened by chance when William arrived at
the palace unexpectedly.
	   Camilla, 50, was there on a regular visit and Charles, realizing
they might bump into each other, asked William if he wanted to meet
her, The Sun said. William agreed and three had an amicable
half-hour of small talk.
	   William has since met Mrs. Parker Bowles twice again, The Sun
said, and Prince Harry, 13, will soon meet her too, if he wants to.
	   ``There was no discussion at all about sensitive matters or
Princess Diana,'' The Sun quoted a ``royal insider'' as saying.
	   Aug. 31 will be the first anniversary of the death of
36-year-old Diana in a car crash in Paris.
	   The newspaper said Mrs. Parker Bowles _ a figure as well known
in Britain as the royals themselves _ was highly nervous about the
meeting.
	   Charles and Mrs. Parker Bowles, who is now divorced, first met
in their 20s. Diana maintained that Charles never really gave up
the relationship, but Charles indicated that he was faithful after
his 1981 marriage to Diana until relations broke down following the
birth of Harry.
	   Mrs. Parker Bowlesm has tow growup children and Charles is
godfather to the elder one, Tom.
	   ``Our readers have a right to know that Charles, Camilla and
William have finally got together,'' the newspaper said.
	   The watchdog Press Complaints Commission also appeared to think
the story did not violate the privacy of the young princes _ which
newspapers have pledged to respect since their mother died with
photographers in pursuit.
	   ``I recognize that certain stories have a public interest,''
said commission chairman Lord Wakeham. ``The palace thought this
one had, it was justified.''
	   As part of the Diana anniversary buildup, her former butler,
Paul Burrell, on Thursday unveiled controversial plans for a
27-acre (11-hectare) memorial garden round Kensington Palace, her
London home. Angry residents say it will turn the top-price
district into a tourist trap.
	   ``This is not going to be a Disneyworld for Diana,'' said
Burrell. ``It is to be a very simple, quiet place for
contemplation.''

Earthquake strikes Azores Islands, killing nine

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES death toll to nine, expected to be final. TRIMS. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ An earthquake shook Portugal's Azores
Islands in the Atlantic Ocean just before dawn Thursday, killing
nine people and leaving some 1,000 people homeless.
	   The quake's magnitude was 5.8 and had its epicenter at sea, 15
kilometers (10 miles) northeast of Faial, one of the group's nine
volcanic islands, a spokesman for Portugal's National Seismological
Institute said.
	   By 2 p.m (1300 GMT), nine people were confirmed dead, all of
them on Faial, according to Helena Vaz, spokeswoman for the Azores
Civil Protection Service. About 90 people on the island were
injured, one seriously.
	   The tremor also caused damage to buildings on the nearby islands
of Pico and Sao Jorge, but no injuries were reported there.
	   Vaz said the rescue services were not expecting to find any more
bodies in the rubble of houses which collapsed on Faial.
	   ``We've reached all areas of the island. Local people have not
reported anyone else missing,'' she said by telephone.
	   Roads were cut off and bridges caved in, forcing rescue crews to
use two Portuguese Air Force Puma helicopters to reach remote
villages, she said. Faial has a population of about 5,000.
	   The quake was felt at 5:19 a.m. (0519 GMT) on four of the nine
Azores Islands which lie 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) west of
Portugal, officials said.
	   Residents said the quake lasted between 15 and 20 seconds and
was followed by a series of minor aftershocks.
	   Portuguese state television RTP showed images filmed in the
small Faial village of Ribeirinha of families standing about in
their nightwear in the bright morning sunshine surveying the damage
done to their houses and cars.
	   An Air Force C-130 transport plane carrying emergency aid left
Lisbon in the afternoon for the three-hour flight to the
archipelago.
	   The plane was taking sniffer dogs, medical teams, electricity
generators, rescue experts, 2,000 blankets and 160 army tents with
capacity for about 1,000 people, Antonio Capinha, a spokesman for
the Internal Affairs Ministry, said.
	   Prime Minister Antonio Guterres canceled a weekend vacation with
Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar to fly to the Azores.
	   The archipelago has a total population of about 250,000, most of
whom farm or fish.
	   The islands have been hit by earthquakes in the past, with 49
people killed and some 300 injured in one of the worst tremors in
1980.

New law brings rise in reports of money laundering, Swiss say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Changes to Swiss law aimed at cracking
down on money laundering appear to be working, with a sharp rise in
suspected cases reported, the government said Thursday.
	   In the three months since the new legislation took effect, 35
cases have been reported to the authorities by banks and other
money managers. This is more than there were during a whole year
under previous rules, the Swiss Office of Police Affairs said.
	   The change to Switzerland's banking secrecy law obliges bankers
and other money managers to report to authorities suspected money
laundering and freeze the assets in question.
	   Following the reports, 57.8 million Swiss francs (dlrs 40
million) held in Swiss-based financial institutions have been
frozen.
	   The majority of the cases involve foreigners, particularly from
the United States and Britain, said Daniel Thelesklaf, who heads
the special police branch dealing with them. Only two or three
cases originated in Switzerland.
	   Around a quarter of the cases involve suspected investment fraud
and a number of others are thought to be linked to drug-related
crimes, although Thelesklaf couldn't specify how many.
	   The new rules apply not only to banks, but to insurance
companies, bureaux de change, investment advisors and other
financial institutions and professionals.
	   Failure to comply with the law brings a fine of 200,000 Swiss
francs (dlrs 130,000).
	   The police office has passed 22 of the 35 reported cases to
prosecuting authorities, Thelesklaf said.
	   The other 13 cases have either been put on file or suspended
pending further inquiries.
	   Under the old rules, 30 to 40 cases annually were passed on to
criminal authorities.
	   The change, which brings Switzerland up to basic international
standards for dealing with money laundering, comes after a series
of embarrassing episodes involving assets deposited by former
foreign rulers in Switzerland.
	   In December, the country's high court ordered the transfer of
assets belonging to the late Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos
to the Philippines, saying it was against Swiss interests ``to
serve as a safe haven'' for flight capital or criminal proceeds.
	   Also frozen in Switzerland pending legal action are assets
belonging to the former Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko and
former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.

Hot weather sets off forest fires across Italy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) - Firefighters worked Thursday to put out blazes that
have already destroyed huge tracts of forest on the island of
Sardinia and in parts of southern Italy.
	   Some 600 hundred tourists were evacuated Wednesday from a
coastal resort at Santa Margherita di Pula, near Cagliari, in the
southern part of the island. No one was injured.
	   ``All the fires in Sardinia's most popular tourist destinations
are under control,'' said Piergiorgio Togni, President of the
Italian National Tourism Organization. ``There is no reason for
alarm.''
	   Sardinia's scenic coastline and crystal clear water attract
thousands of tourists each summer. Authorities have blamed the
fires on arsonists who want to discourage tourism and construction
on the island.
	   Already about 1,000 acres (hectares) have been destroyed in
Sardinia alone. Several days of near heat wave temperatures and
strong winds set off the blazes earlier this week.
	   Despite cooler weather, scattered blazes continued to burn
across Puglia and Basilicata, in southern Italy, and on the island
of Sicily.

U.N. driver killed by bandits in northern Uganda
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Armed bandits have killed a U.N. World
Food Program driver in northern Uganda, raising concern that the
distribution of relief food to people displaced by fighting and
famine in the region and in neighboring southern Sudan could be
threatened, the agency said Thursday.
	   Ugandan William Asiku was killed Wednesday when 12 heavily armed
men blocked his car as he headed towards the northwestern town of
Arua on the border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo and
just south of the border with Sudan, WFP said in a statement.
	   The assailants dragged Asiku from the car, shot him and then
blew up the clearly marked WFP vehicle, the statement said.
	   The statement did not identify the assailants, but rebels of the
Lord's Resistance Army, who are based in southern Sudan, have been
oeprating in the region since 1987.
	   An estimated 300,000 people have been driven from their homes
and are living in camps. The WFP supplies them and 160,000 refugees
from neighboring countries with food, the statement said.
	   The main road from Uganda to southern Sudan, which is in the
throes of a civil war and famine, passes through Arua.
	   WFP said it trucks in between 500 and 1,000 metric tons of food
and supplies every month through Arua.
	   ``Insecurity in Arua has far-reaching implications, not only for
thousands of displaced Ugandans and refugees WFP is trying to
assist in the north, but also for many famine-struck communities of
southern Sudan reached by road from Uganda,'' the statement said.
	   ``Continued problems with insecurity on this road could greatly
jeopardize this vital supply route.''
	   The U.N. agency said Asiku's death was the second of a WFP staff
member in northern Uganda this year. Another Ugandan died when his
car overturned as he was trying to escape a bandit attack in
northeastern Uganda.
	   Two other WFP staff members were killed in Sudan on their way
back from distributing relief food to camps for displaced people in
central Kordofan province.
	   WFP Executive Director Catherine Bertini called on the Ugandan
authorities to investigate the ``vicious and senseless killing.''

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Suriname president confirming Bouterse is abroad,
rumors say in either Trinidad or Brazil. Has moved to some points. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch officials have asked
authorities in Trinidad and Tobago to arrest and extradite
Suriname's former dictator Desi Bouterse, who is reportedly
visiting the Caribbean country, an official said Thursday.
	   Prosecutors in The Hague have charged Bouterse with cocaine
smuggling, claiming he transported hundreds of kilograms (pounds)
of cocaine to Europe, said Elizabeth Horstink, a spokeswoman for
the prosecutor's office.
	   Bouterse has denied the charges, and Suriname refuses to
extradite him to the Netherlands for trial.
	   The former army officer who led a military coup in 1980, five
years after Suriname won independence from the Netherlands, remains
the most powerful man in his South American country. His
military-based party lost 1992 elections but regrouped and won on a
strong national platform in 1996. It is widely expected to win 2000
elections and make Bouterse president again.
	   ``We've received information that he is traveling around,''
Horstink said.
	   She added that Interpol issued a warrant for Bouterse's arrest
in August 1997, and the request sent to authorities in Trinidad and
Tobago this week was ``a logical next step.''
	   Rumors in Suriname place Bouterse in either Trinidad or Brazil.
Surinamese President Jules Wijdenbosch on Wednesday confirmed he
was out of the country but would not reveal Bouterse's whereabouts
because of the international arrest warrant.

Taliban army rebuilding museum with U.N. help

 &UR; EDS: Adds more context about U.N.'s difficulty with Taliban.
UPDATES with U.N. money coming from UNESCO &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos KAB101-2
 &UR; By ZAHEERUDDIN ABDULLAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's Taliban religious army
began rebuilding the war-devastated Kabul Museum Thursday with the
help of the United Nations.
	   A casualty of the protracted civil war that has destroyed entire
neighborhoods of Kabul, the museum, once an elegant dome-shaped
building that stood guard on the southeastern outskirts of the city
for 200 years, is in ruins.
	   The roof is gone, shattered by relentless rocket attacks. Inside
the building doors hang off their hinges, the floors are littered
with the debris of spent shells and charred artifacts.
	   Most of the treasures of the museum -- a fortune in Byzantine
gold coins, precious ivory pieces and Buddhist statues -- have been
stolen.
	   About 30 percent of the original collection is all that remains,
Deputy Information Minister Abdul Rehman Ottaqi said during a brief
inauguration ceremony to mark the start of the reconstruction.
	   UNESCO, the cultural arm of the United Nations, is giving dlrs
14,000 toward the reconstruction, most of it in building materials.
	   Kabul Museum and the preservation of its remaining treasures
represents UNESCO's first foray into Afghanistan, where U.N.
agencies providing humanitarian assistance have had difficulties
dealing with the Taliban religious army.
	   For a brief period earlier this year the U.N. pulled its staff
out of southern Kandahar to protest attacks on its staff. Most of
the friction between the Taliban and the U.N. has been over access
to health care and education for women, something the U.N. is
insisting upon.
	   The damage to the museum was the fault of warring Islamic groups
who took control of Kabul from the ousted communist regime in 1992.
Then the museum was untouched. It's treasures on display.
	   But marauding bands of mujahedeen or Islamic warriors swept
through the museum. The stolen artifacts were brought to
neighboring Pakistan and sold in the markets and bazaars of
Peshawar on the border with Afghanistan.
	   A non-profit group called the Society for the Preservation of
Afghan Culture was established in 1993 and included representatives
from several countries. Currently the Italian ambassador to
Pakistan heads the group, which has spent money trying to buy back
museum artifacts and return them to Afghanistan.
	   But many of Afghanistan's treasurers have left the region and
now are believed to be in the hands of collectors in several
countries including Britain and Japan.
	   ``This is our history. This is Afghanistan's history,'' Ottaqi
said. ``This museum belongs not just to Afghanistan, but to the
world and the world should help with the reconstruction.''
	   Until 1996 when the Taliban took control of Kabul the museum was
on the front line. Rival Islamic rebels would hide their weapons
inside and scurry for cover from incoming rockets.
	   The area was heavily mined, but has since been cleared of most
of the deadly devices, said officials.
	   The Taliban army which now rules roughly 85 percent of
Afghanistan is fighting a northern-based alliance, led by former
military chief Ahmed Shah Massood, who is believed to have hidden
some of the artifacts for safekeeping in the hills that surround
the beleaguered capital.
	   The northern-based alliance controls about 15 percent of the
country.

Swedish gold may have come from Nazi victims, commission says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The tons of gold that Sweden received
in business dealings with Nazi Germany may have included gold
looted from Jews, a commission said Thursday in an interim report
to the government on the sensitive question.
	   However, the commission said, there is no evidence that any of
the gold came from death camps where the Nazis melted down victims'
jewelry and even tooth fillings.
	   The report was part of Sweden's detailed investigation into its
commerce with Germany during World War II, in which Sweden was
neutral. Sweden sold Nazi Germany iron ore, ball bearings and other
supplies critical to its war effort.
	   The trade has been a nagging issue for a country that prides
itself on supporting tolerance and human rights, raising questions
about whether the country's war-era leaders turned a blind eye to
Nazi horrors.
	   ``From today's perspective, it can be established that the moral
aspect should have been considered openly, on a broad basis and
seriously, not later than the summer of 1944,'' commission head
Rolf Wirten said.
	   The commission, which also is investigating whether other Jewish
property including unclaimed bank accounts remains in Sweden, did
not make recommendations on whether the government should consider
restitution for the possibly looted gold.
	   But its strong statement of Sweden's moral responsibility
parallels position of the World Jewish Congress, which was a strong
force in urging Sweden to begin the investigation. In a visit to
Sweden last month WJC leader Israel Singer said a moral accounting
was more important than a fiscal tally.
	   According to the commission, Sweden received 30.4 tons (33.4
avoirdupois tons) of gold from Germany in 1940-1944. Of this, 1.5
tons (1.65 tons) was in gold coins, which could have been obtained
by Germany either by plundering it from Holocaust victims or by
ordering Jews to sell their gold to the Nazi government.
	   After the war, Sweden returned 13.2 tons (14.5 tons) of gold to
Belgium and the Netherlands after determining that it had been
taken by the Nazis from their central banks.
	   Of the remainder, ``the possibility of this quantity of gold
having contained a minor proportion of gold confiscated or
plundered from individuals cannot be excluded,'' the commission
report said.
	   But the commission said it did not intend ``to give the
impression that any exactitude can be achieved'' in determining
whether any of the gold was tainted.
	   The commission, appointed by the government last year, is
expected to give its final report by the end of the year.

Three Israelis on boat briefly detained in Egypt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian authorities briefly detained three
Israeli citizens after their boat drifted into Egyptian waters,
police officials said Thursday.
	   The three, aged 40, 17 and 14, were taken to a police station in
the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba, near Israel, said the
officials, who spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Police said the arrest occurred late Wednesday. But Effie
Ben-Mattityahu, a spokesman at the Israeli Foreign Ministry, said
the three were detained Monday and released after two hours.
	   He called the arrest ``routine in the summer season.''

Mubarak defies U.N. embargo to fly to Libya
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Mubarak's return grafs 1 and 2.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak violated a
U.N. air embargo Thursday by flying to Libya to meet Col. Moammar
Gadhafi.
	   Mubarak, accompanied by several ministers and aides, returned a
few hours later, repeating the breach of the embargo, which bans
direct flights to and from Libya.
	   Mubarak is the most senior world leader to defy the air embargo,
which was imposed in 1992 after Gadhafi refused to hand over two
Libyans suspected in the 1988 bombing of an American airliner over
Lockerbie, Scotland that killed 270 people.
	   Mubarak flew from Cairo to Al-Abrak town, 60 kilometers (37
miles) from the northern seaside town of Al-Bayda, Libyan
television said.
	   ``President Hosni Mubarak arrived aboard an Egyptian plane at
Al-Abrak civilian airport,'' a commentator on Libyan television
said in a live broadcast from Al-Abrak where Libyan officials gave
Mubarak a red carpet welcome.
	   Mubarak's visit was not announced and Egypt's official Middle
East News Agency only reported his arrival in Libya at about the
same time Libyan television started its live broadcast.
	   The broadcast was monitored in Cairo.
	   From Al-Abrak, Mubarak drove to Al-Bayda where he met with
Gadhafi who is recovering from surgery to repair a hip bone he
broke on Monday while exercising. Al-Bayda is 1,400 kilometers (865
miles) east of Tripoli, the Libyan capital.
	   The state Libyan television showed Mubarak shaking hands with
Gadhafi who sat on a wheel chair dressed in a golden brown
traditional Libyan gown. Mubarak also kissed Gadhafi on both cheeks
and inquired about his health.
	   Large crowds of Libyans greeted Mubarak on his arrival at the
Al-Abrak airport, the television said.
	   No reason was given for the visit, but Mubarak was believed to
have gone to Libya to wish Gadhafi a speedy recovery after his
surgery.
	   During their meeting, Gadhafi's doctors showed Mubarak three
X-rays of the broken hip.
	   Since the surgery on Monday, Gadhafi, 56, is reported to be in
good condition and resumed normal work on Wednesday, the Libyan
official news agency JANA said. Gadhafi's surgery was broadcast by
Libyan television on Tuesday.
	   Mubarak has visited Libya many times since 1992 but has always
driven across the Egyptian-Libyan border.
	   Last month, the Organization of African Unity urged member
states to ignore the sanctions for visits with humanitarian and
religious implications or those relating to official OAU work.
	   But until Thursday's flight by Mubarak, only Chad and Niger had
heeded the call, and Gadhafi twice canceled a visit to Egypt last
month, apparently angered by Egypt's refusal to let him fly to
Cairo.
	   Libya recently launched a campaign to win wider support from the
22-nation Arab League to lift the U.N. embargo. In September 1997,
the League had urged member states to ``take steps to ease the
toughness of the sanctions.''

Free vacation for young rape suspect draws sharp reactions in
</HEADLINE>
Norway &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Lacking treatment facilities for a
15-year-old rape suspect, authorities sent him on an
all-expenses-paid foreign vacation.
	   The suspect, whose name was not released, was arrested on
charges of raping a 22-year-old shop clerk as she was working by
herself in June.
	   Child-care officials wanted to place him in a treatment program
after he was released from detention, but could not find one, so he
was allowed to join a vacation trip by two child-care
professionals, Sverre Shetelig, of the Oslo Child Welfare Board,
said by telephone.
	   The two-week car trip, whose iteninerary was not detailed, cost
Norwegian taxpayers 50,000 kroner (dlrs 6,600), and many fear that
the boy will interpret the trip as a reward for committing a sex
crime, the Oslo newspaper Aftenposten reported Thursday.
	   ``We understand that people react to this, but it was not meant
as any reward,'' said Shetelig. He said the trip was the best the
board could come up with on short notice, and would help the boy
build bonds with the two staff members who will treat him later.
	   Reports of the free trip came at the same time as the rape
victim's attorney, Anne Kristine Bohinen, accused welfare
authorities of doing to help her client.
	   ``The boy is young, but he is a criminal. It is very
questionable that the child welfare authorities follow up in this
way,'' she was quoted as telling the Oslo newspaper Verdens Gang.
His victim, on the other hand, didn't even get an offer to talk to
a psychologist, she said.

Report: Private security guards outnumber police in Mexico City
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Private security agents now outnumber police
officers in Mexico City, according to a study published Wednesday
in the newspaper La Jornada.
	   With a high crime rate and a corrupt and ineffective police
force, wealthy and even middle-class Mexicans have increasingly
turned to bodyguards and private security agencies to protect them.
	   While there are fewer than 100,000 uniformed officers in the
three police forces of Mexico City's Public Security Secretariat,
private security agencies employ more than 150,000, according to a
Mexico City council committee.
	   And of the 1,500 private security companies, only 300 operate
legally, city councilman Victor Manuel Soto Camacho told La
Jornada.

	   BOULDER, Colorado (AP) _ Frank Shorter has proof the East German
who beat him for the gold medal in the 1976 Olympic marathon used
steroids.
	   Shorter, the gold medalist in 1972, finished 50 seconds behind
Waldemar Cierpinski four years later and got the silver medal.
	   The German government is investigating the performance-enhancing
program used by the former East German government. Ten volumes of
research files regarding East Germany's track and field athletes
were uncovered in Leipzig in November.
	   Two doctors and four coaches currently are on trial in Berlin
for allegedly administering steroids to swimmers. Last week, one
doctor agreed to cooperate in return for a lighter sentence.
Athletes have testified they were forced to take the drugs.
	   ``As someone potentially harmed by this (East German doping),
under German law I have the right to the documents,'' Shorter, who
has a law degree, told the Rocky Mountain News Wednesday. ``In my
hands is the code list, which I've had for several months. It's got
judo, it's got swimming, it's got track and field. I have
everybody's number who was on that drug program. Cierpinski was No.
62.''
	   Shorter said he has spoken with the chief investigator, Werner
Franke, who told him Cierpinski also was an informer for the Stasi,
East Germany's secret police.
	   ``So I'm not sure he's going to have a very easy time pleading
lack of knowledge of what was going on,'' Shorter said.
	   The ramifications of the German investigation are immense for
the International Olympic Committee, which could be inundated with
appeals from athletes who finished behind medal-winning East
Germans. American Don Kardong, who was fourth in the 1976 Olympic
marathon, could win the bronze medal.
	   East Germany's women swimmers, who failed to win a medal at
Munich in 1972, won 11 gold medals in 13 events four years later at
Montreal. Bill Hybl, president of the U.S. Olympic Committee, said
as many as 50 U.S. women swimmers could be affected by the Berlin
trial or subsequent trials.
	   ``We are going to support U.S. Swimming in those cases where
there is conclusive proof,'' Hybl said. ``The athletes are
testifying. Their admissions, along with at least one of the
coaches, look like pretty strong evidence to me. We will pursue
with the International Olympic Committee any injustices that have
occurred.''
	   Shorter was heavily favored at Montreal, but he was running with
a sore ankle, and Cierpinski broke him at 20 miles. Shorter later
learned he had a broken foot.
	   Shorter said Wednesday he suspected at the time Cierpinski had
used steroids but chose not to say anything because he didn't want
to sound like a whiner.
	   ``I suspected the minute he ran away from me,'' Shorter said.
``Just the way he did it, the ease with which he did it. It sounds
like sour grapes when you say nobody could do it that easy. You
know what kind of effort it would take for a normal person? It's
like, `Go ahead, pull away from me, but show some effort.' ''

World Cup: FIFA says defender misses final despite French appeal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Blanc suspended for two games &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ FIFA Thursday banned Laurent Blanc for two games,
confirming that the French defender was out of Sunday's World Cup
final.
	   The suspension, which also will rule him out of France's first
qualifying game of the next European Championship, can't be
appealed.
	   The Olympic Marseille star, who has played 74 times for France,
was sent off for the first time in his long career for pushing
Croatian defender Slaven Bilic in the face Wednesday as the two
prepared to chase a free kick.
	   Although there were claims that Bilic, who tumbled to the
ground, may have been guilty of play-acting to get the Frenchman
sent off, FIFA said the red card and the suspension stayed.
	   Reacting to French officials who said earlier they would appeal
any suspension, FIFA said that, unless there was a case of mistaken
identity and it wasn't Blanc who committed the offense, there was
no chance of the ban being dropped.
	   ``A one or two-game ban can't be appealed against,'' said FIFA
spokesman Marius Schneider. ``Only a suspension of three games or
more can be appealed.
	   ``The disciplinary committee doesn't have the power to relieve
him of a suspension for this match.''
	   FIFA regards Blanc's action as violent conduct and has suspended
other players, such as Dutch striker Patrick Kluivert and
Argentina's Ariel Ortega, for more than one game for similar
conduct. Any suspension means Blanc misses Sunday's final against
four-time and defending titlist Brazil at the Stade de France.
	   Blanc was clearly shown to push Bilic in the face after the two
players had tugged each other shirts. The French felt it was a
yellow rather than a red card offense.
	   ``It was unjust, it was too harsh of the referee,'' French coach
Aime Jacquet said of the expulsion.
	   ``We will appeal but we fear it will be a formality. We always
have hope but I don't want to give Blanc any false hope.''
	   Blanc, scorer of the extra time ``Golden Goal'' against Paraguay
that put the French into the quarterfinal, said he wasn't confident
either that a suspension could be avoided.
	   ``It would be a great surprise,'' he said. ``It would be
unique.''
	   But he's still upset.
	   ``My expulsion punishes the player but the really bad scenario
is that it also punishes the team. I have this feeling of having
tasted the cake, but now I'm not allowed to touch the cherry,''
said Blanc.
	   Bilic said that Blanc's red card was all his own fault.
	   ``I didn't get him sent off, he did,'' the Everton defender
said.
	   ``He touched me, technically that's an offense, and the referee
saw it.
	   ``I'm not happy that he's going to miss the final, but if you do
something like that you're going to get punished. That's all there
is to say about it.''

World Cup: On brightest day for Les Bleus, black day for Blanc
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Blanc suspended for two games &QL; 
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ Laurent Blanc had been the
cornerstone during the whole of France's World Cup campaign. Now
Les Bleus will have to do without him during Sunday's final against
Brazil.
	   Fifteen minutes away from the supreme match, he was sent off in
the closing stages of France's 2-1 semifinal win over Croatia
Wednesday, for slapping an opponent in the face. On Thursday he was
suspended for two games, including the final.
	   ``I have this feeling of having tasted the cake, but now I'm not
allowed to touch the cherry,'' said Blanc.
	   The veteran Olympique Marseille defender scored the World Cup's
first extra time ``Golden Goal'' against Paraguay to get France to
the quarterfinals. He also scored the decisive penalty in a
shootout against Italy to get France to the semifinals.
	   For six games, the central defender led an ironclad defense that
made France the envy of the World Cup.
	   A red card usually carries an automatic suspension for at least
one match. Even though the French federation appealed to FIFA, it
had little hope.
	   ``We fear it will be a formality. We always have hope but I
don't want to give Blanc any false hope,'' French coach Aime
Jacquet said before making the appeal. ``It was unjust, it was too
harsh of the referee,'' he said of the decision by Spain's Jose
Maria Garcia.
	   No sooner had the French tried to prise open the door for Blanc
to play, FIFA slammed it shut.
	   ``A one or two-game ban can't be appealed against,'' said FIFA
spokesman Marius Schneider. ``Only a suspension of three games or
more can be appealed.
	   ``The disciplinary committee doesn't have the power to relieve
him of a suspension for this match.''
	   The whole nation was crying out injustice because it felt the
goalmouth incident deserved perhaps a yellow card but certainly not
an expulsion that robbed the Marseille player of his greatest day.
	   ``It's a personal catastrophe,'' the 32-year old defender said.
``It would have been worse if the Croats would have been allowed to
come back and beat us. Then I would never have forgiven myself.''
	   It was Blanc's first sending off for France in 74
internationals.
	   Together with Marcel Desailly in the center of defense, Blanc
had given poise and confidence to the team over the last month as
it scored six successive World Cup wins.
	   And for symbolism, nothing could be more cruel to Les Bleus. For
six games so far Blanc had been kissing goalie Fabien Barthez on
his bald head, before and after the game, and the lucky charm
worked like a dream.
	   ``It has brought us luck. See, we're in the final,'' said
Barthez. ``I'm sure Laurent will be able to come up with something
for the final.''
	   Blanc wasn't as sweet with Slaven Bilic through.
	   During the whole match, whenever the tall Blanc surged forward
for freekicks and corners, he came face-to-face with the Croat
defender in one long push-and-shove match.
	   And so again in the 75th minute.
	   ``We scuffled and there was contact. Then he threw himself on
the ground,'' said Blanc. Red came out and France had to pull back
in defense to put off the Croats seeking a last-minute equalizer.
	   Bilic said that Blanc's red card was all his own fault.
	   ``I didn't get him sent off, he did,'' the Everton defender
said.
	   ``He touched me, technically that's an offense, and the referee
saw it.
	   ``I'm not happy that he's going to miss the final, but if you do
something like that you're going to get punished,'' Bilic said.
	   Blanc saw it differently. ``It was a free kick for me. I had not
intention to get hold of him. He gripped me.
	   He said that after the match, Bilic came over to apologize.
``Maybe I should have punched him there,'' he said, only half in
jest.

New law brings increase in reports of money laundering, Swiss say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Changes to Swiss law aimed at cracking
down on money laundering appear to be working, with a sharp rise in
suspected cases reported, the government said Thursday.
	   In the three months since the new legislation took effect, 35
cases have been reported to the authorities by banks and other
money managers. This is more than there were during a whole year
under previous rules, the Swiss Office of Police Affairs said.
	   The change to Switzerland's banking secrecy law obliges bankers
and other money managers to report to authorities suspected money
laundering and freeze the assets in question.
	   Following the reports, 57.8 million Swiss francs (dlrs 40
million) held in Swiss-based financial institutions have been
frozen.
	   The majority of the cases involve foreigners, particularly from
the United States and Britain, said Daniel Thelesklaf, who heads
the special police branch dealing with them. Only two or three
cases originated in Switzerland.
	   Around a quarter of the cases involve suspected investment fraud
and a number of others are thought to be linked to drug-related
crimes, although Thelesklaf couldn't specify how many.
	   The new rules apply not only to banks, but to insurance
companies, bureaus of change, investment advisors and other
financial institutions and professionals.
	   Failure to comply with the law brings a fine of 200,000 Swiss
francs (dlrs 130,000).
	   The police office has passed 22 of the 35 reported cases to
prosecuting authorities, Thelesklaf said.
	   The other 13 cases have either been put on file or suspended
pending further inquiries.
	   Under the old rules, 30 to 40 cases annually were passed on to
criminal authorities.
	   The change, which brings Switzerland up to basic international
standards for dealing with money laundering, comes after a series
of embarrassing episodes involving assets deposited by former
foreign rulers in Switzerland.
	   In December, the country's high court ordered the transfer of
assets belonging to the late President Ferdinand Marcos to the
Philippines, saying it was against Swiss interests ``to serve as a
safe haven'' for flight of capital or criminal proceeds.
	   Also frozen in Switzerland pending legal action are assets
belonging to the late Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko and former
Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.

World Cup: Tottenham join bidding for Kluivert
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Tottenham Hotspur appears poised to win the
bidding war to lure Dutch World Cup star Patrick Kluivert to
England.
	   The Evening Standard newspaper reported Thursday that Kluivert's
Italian club, AC Milan, had negotiated a 7.5 million pound (dlrs
12.45 million) fee with Tottenham and the deal hinged on the
striker's consent.
	   The Standard said Kluivert, who scored two goals in the
Netherlands' last two World Cup games against Argentina and Brazil
after being sent off earlier in the tournament, is expected to
finalize personal terms with Spurs.
	   Earlier this week, the 22-year-old striker was reportedly close
to signing with Arsenal after the Premier League champions agreed
to a 7 million pound (dlrs 11.62 million) deal with AC Milan.
	   However, the Evening Standard reported Arsenal's interest cooled
because of his likely wage damands, estimated to be about 30,000
pounds (dlrs 49,800) a week.
	   Kluivert joined AC Milan from Ajax last season and still has
three years on his contract with the Serie A club.
	   ``I have to try to leave Italy now. It has not worked out for me
at Milan,'' he said earlier this week. ``If I can move from Milan
my best choices would be England or Spain.''

Chernobyl victims protest cuts in national programs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with government official's comments on Chernobyl Fund
in new grafs 7-9 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Dozens of demonstrators rallied at
Ukraine's Cabinet headquarters on Thursday to protest a recent
presidential decree that would cut Chernobyl programs.
	   The protesters, who came from regions heavily contaminated by
the 1986 catastrophe, protested against President Leonid Kuchma's
decision to halve payments by employers to the state-owned
Chernobyl Fund.
	   ``Implementation of the decree will almost completely destroy
all social programs targeting Chernobyl victims,'' said Yuri
Andreyev of the Chernobyl Ukraine Union, which organized the
picket.
	   He said Kuchma's decree, which cut employers' payments to the
Chernobyl Fund to 5 percent of their workers' salaries, would
deprive the government of the money to finance medical treatment
and pay compensation to those who suffered from the Chernobyl
disaster.
	   The government set up the fund to address the consequences of
the 1986 explosion and fire that destroyed Chernobyl's reactor No.
4 and sent a radioactive cloud over much of Europe.
	   The 10 percent Chernobyl tax allowed the government to collect
over dlrs 1 billion annually.
	   But on Thursday, Emergency Situations Minister Valery Kalchenko
warned that the reduction in the Chernobyl tax would make it much
more difficult for the government to deal with the aftermath of the
catastrophe.
	   He said the government needs to raise an additional 400 million
hryvna (dlrs 200 million) this year to compensate for the shortfall
the new 5 percent tax would cause. In addition, the Chernobyl Fund
owed 458 million hryvna (dlrs 229 million) in social payments as of
the beginning of 1998, said Kalchenko.
	   ``It's a fantastic sum for our ministry,'' Kalchenko said,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Thursday's picket by some 150 protesters continued a series of
recent demonstrations by angry Chernobyl victims near government
headquarters in Kiev.
	   The government estimates that over 10 percent of Ukrainian
territory has been contaminated by radiation. About 3,600
Ukrainians who took part in the Chernobyl cleanup effort have died
from radiation exposure.
	   Kuchma recently estimated Chernobyl's total cost to Ukraine at
dlrs 130 billion.

Scientists: Not enough evidence that drug prevents breast cancer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Embargoed for release until 2301 GMT; time set by source
 &UR; By EMMA ROSS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Contradicting U.S. findings, British scientists
who conducted the longest running study of tamoxifen conclude there
is not enough evidence that the drug prevents breast cancer,
according to research published Friday.
	   Although scientists agree that tamoxifen fights the recurrence
of breast cancer in women who have already had surgery, they are
divided over whether it prevents the disease from occurring in the
first place. Part of the caution over use of the drug relates to
its side effects, which include doubling the risk of getting
uterine cancer and a tripling of risk for a blood clot in the
lungs, a potentially fatal disorder.
	   A U.S. National Cancer Institute study released in April said
tamoxifen reduced by 45 percent the chances of breast cancer in
high-risk women, and the trial of 13,388 women was abandoned early
to give every woman involved the option of taking the drug.
	   But researchers from the Royal Marsden Hospital in London, in a
smaller but longer-running study, found that the incidence of
breast cancer among 2,494 women with a family history of the
disease was the same whether they had been taking the drug or not.
	   A separate study following 5,408 women for 4 years, conducted by
the European Institute of Oncology in Milan, Italy, came to a
similar conclusion. Both studies were published in The Lancet, a
British medical journal.
	   ``There are significant numbers of women requesting to take
tamoxifen since the American study and I have grave concerns about
the widespread use of it in healthy women,'' said Dr. Trevor
Powles, leader of the British study.
	   Tamoxifen is known as an ``anti-estrogen'' because it blocks the
effects of the hormone in some tissues and retards growth of cancer
cells that depend upon estrogen.
	   Powles said the results obtained in the U.S. study, which
followed women for an average of 3 years, could mean that tamoxifen
merely was treating existing undetectable tumors rather than
preventing new ones and it is unclear how effective the drug would
have proved if the study had continued for several more years. He
said the women who later develop tumors could be worse off because
their cancer would be resistant to tamoxifen, the most widely used
drug for the treatment of the disease.
	   At the time the U.S. study was abandoned, the British scientists
accused the National Cancer Institute of acting prematurely, and
perhaps raising false hopes.
	   ``We could see no difference in the incidence of breast
cancer,'' Powles said. ``The chances of this being a statistical
quirk is less than 10 percent and the chances that our study and
the Milan study are both a statistical quirk are less than 2
percent.''
	   Powles said his study, which followed women for an average of 8
years, does not conclude that tamoxifen does not prevent breast
cancer, only that there is not enough evidence yet to say it does.
	   After six years in the trial, 34 of the women on tamoxifen
developed breast cancer, compared with 36 women on the placebo, the
study said.
	   ``We still believe tamoxifen will prevent a large number of
women from getting breast cancer, but it will take 10 years of
follow-up to see a real prevention,'' Powles said.
	   Barnett Kramer, deputy director of the National Cancer Institute
in Washington, D.C., said the British and Italian studies do not
shake his confidence in the findings of the U.S. study.
	   ``We are extremely confident, because of the number of women
that the data stands, and the chance that our results occurred by
chance were 1 in 10,000,'' he said, adding the British study size
was small.
	   He said that the inclusion of women taking hormone replacement
therapy also confounded Powles' results because it added estrogen,
which he said can blunt the effect of tamoxifen.
	   Powles countered that even discounting the women on HRT, there
still could have been a significant difference in the cancer rate
and there was not.
	   And in a separate commentary in The Lancet, Kathleen Pritchard
of the University of Toronto in Canada said the differences in the
findings between the European studies and the U.S. study may result
from the fact that more women participated in the American study,
that they were older in the U.S. study and that the risk factors
taken into account were different.

 &UR; Yugoslavia to allow OSCE mission to visit next week &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ In what a U.S. diplomat termed a ``step
in the right direction,'' Yugoslavia has agreed to let an
international mission visit rebellious Kosovo province, officials
said Thursday.
	   Yugoslavia had refused to allow a mission from the 54-nation
Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe, or OSCE, to
visit the country until Belgrade's membership in the group was
restored.
	   The United States and key European countries have been demanding
for months that the Yugoslavs allow the mission into the country as
part of diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis in Kosovo, where
ethnic Albanians are fighting for independence.
	   Sources in the OSCE, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the organization decided Thursday to accept an offer by the
Yugoslavs for limited-duration visit to Kosovo and other parts of
the country.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, which along with Montenegro
forms Yugoslavia.
	   According to the sources, U.S. representative David Johnson told
the OSCE meeting the Yugoslav offer was a ``step in the right
direction'' and could pave the way for a longer term mediation by
the group's special envoy, former Spanish Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez.
	   In the Yugoslav capital Belgrade, the private Beta news agency
quoted government spokesman Ivica Dacic as saying the invitation
was made as a ``goodwill gesture'' and that the OSCE team would
stay about a week.

Hallmark Cards buys out British competitor
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: LEADS with closing stock price, speculation about higher bid
from Hallmark's rival, comment from Creative Publishing chairman,
ADDING byline &QL;

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Maybe investors should mail a thank-you note to
Hallmark Cards, which agreed Thursday to snap up British rival
Creative Publishing PLC for 188 million pounds (dlrs 306 million)
in cash.
	   The deal would create Britain's biggest greeting card group,
with a market share approaching 30 percent. The announcement sent
Creative Publishing shares soaring on the London Stock Exchange.
	   Hallmark bid 233 pence (dlrs 3.80) per share, or 37 percent more
than Creative Publishing's closing price on Wednesday. Creative
Publishing finished just slightly shy of the bid price, closing at
227 pence (dlrs 3.70) per share.
	   There were reports in London suggesting that Hallmark's U.S.
rival, American Greetings, might try to enter the fray with an
unsolicited bid, but Hallmark and Creative Publishing sought to
play down the idea.
	   ``I'm not aware of it,'' Creative Publishing chairman Keith
Chapman said by telephone. ``We've had talks with them through the
years, but nothing recent.''
	   Hallmark characterized rumors of a rival bid as ``a speculative
game'' and said it had offered ``a full and fair price.''
	   A spokeswoman at American Greetings did not immediately return a
reporter's phone call placed to the company's headquarters in
Cleveland, Ohio.
	   Executives at Hallmark and Creative Publishing called their
companies a perfect fit and said no layoffs are planned.
	   Hallmark is a leader at the high end of Britain's greeting card
business, selling fancy cards at premium prices. Creative
Publishing is the market leader of boxed cards, such as Christmas
greetings sold in bulk for much cheaper prices per card.
	   Hallmark will also get Creative Publishing's manufacturing plant
at its home base of Bradford, England. Hallmark's British
subsidiary has previously hired outside contractors to make cards
for the British market.
	   The companies said they anticipated no regulatory problems with
the merger, because there is little overlap in their businesses and
the British greeting card industry will remain highly competitive.
	   Hallmark Cards Inc., the world's largest manufacturer of
greeting cards, is privately held and based in Kansas City,
Missouri.

What World Cup? Ireland prepares to party as Tour de France hits
</HEADLINE>
town
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ While the French have their eye on the
World Cup final, Ireland is gearing up for the biggest sporting
event in its history _ the Tour de France.
	   The red, white and blue of the French tricolor adorned shops,
pubs and homes from Dublin to Cork on Thursday as the Irish started
a weeklong party to celebrate the start of the world's premier
cycling event.
	   Dublin Castle, headquarters for the Tour's weekend start in the
capital, rechristened itself the Chateau de Dublin in a sign of how
this Gaelic land is going Gallic as host of the 85th annual Tour.
Tourists and fans rubbernecked at the tall, thin athletes in
bodyhugging Lycra.
	   ``It's like when the Pope came here, people try to be blase but
the emotion's building and building,'' said Bill Morrison, an
official for the Irish tourist authority Bord Failte, which has
struggled for find accommodation for more than 10,000 extra guests
associated with the Tour.
	   The Irish government committed 2 million pounds (dlrs 3 million)
_ part of it invested in improving its hit-and-miss road network _
for the right to hold the first three days of the competition,
which is likely to draw 300,000 to 400,000 spectators. The offer
couldn't have been better timed for France, which already has its
hands full hosting the World Cup.
	   The 21 cycling teams _ including six French, six Italian and
four Spanish, plus the lone but potent German team, Telekom _
arrived Thursday afternoon for their physicals and to start
exploring the first two days' courses.
	   Chris Boardman, the British sprint specialist and a favorite to
win Saturday's opening 5.7-kilometer (3.5-mile) prologue in
downtown Dublin for his French Gan sponsors, admitted he felt
insecure and under pressure.
	   ``I'm not in the best shape I could be in,'' he said, citing
distractions in his personal life for his lackluster season.
	   ``This year I'll probably be in the first five and might win,''
said Boardman, an Olympic champion who already has two Tour de
France prologue wins under his belt. ``I'm not being negative, just
realistic.''
	   Dubliners high and low were just being expansive.
	   ``It's a magnificent achievement for Ireland to woo the Tour
here,'' said Irish Foreign Minister David Andrews, taking a stroll
past the Oscar Wilde statue on Merrion Square, the first sharp turn
in Saturday's prologue.
	   Andrews plans to watch the first 180.5-kilometer (111.9-mile)
stage Sunday as the cyclists traverse the coastal road south of
Dublin _ then, along with Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, catch a
flight to Paris to watch France play Brazil in the World Cup final.
	   ``It's a great honor for us. But then we've got a great affinity
with the French _ ties of blood, ties of passion,'' said John
O'Leary, holding a placard touting the services of ``Christine
Murphy, True Irish Traditional Fortune Teller.''
	   But he'd make no predictions of who might win, since like most
Dubliners he has no idea who any of the competitors are.
	   Asked if he'd heard of last year's winner, Germany's Jan
Ullrich, O'Leary said: ``Sounds like he's Swedish. Or is he a
lady?''
	   ``Nobody knows who the riders are, but it should be good
crack,'' said Ciaran Parker, 30, using the Irish slang for fun
conversation. A cyclist himself, he plans to watch the race from
the vantage point of a pub as the racers return to Dublin via the
narrow winding roads of the Wicklow Mountains.
	   ``They're Irish mountains. We're not talking the Alps here,'' he
said.
	   Local cycling enthusiasts are hoping that the Tour's sojourn
through Ireland will rekindle interest in a sport barely on the
national consciousness since the glory days of 1980s, when Stephen
Roche won the Tour in 1987 and Sean Kelly four times won the Tour's
``green jersey'' as its most consistent finisher.
	   ``I never really thought it would be possible to bring such a
big event here,'' said Kelly, who on Monday will see the race
travel past his hometown of Carrick-on-Suir, midway along the
205.5-kilometer (125 mile) route to Ireland's second city, Cork.

World Cup: Crowds at Stade de France and Les Bleus don't get along
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ The longer Les Bleus play at
gleaning new Stade de France, the less they like the crowds.
France's diehard, passionate soccer fans can't afford World Cup
tickets. Mostly it's the well-heeled who occupy the spectator
tribunes.
	   From coach Aime Jacquet down to third-string goalie Lionel
Charbonnier, there is only one message ahead of Sunday's final:
Loosen up that tie and start truly rooting. Otherwise the final
might as well played in Rio de Janeiro's Maracana Stadium.
	   ``The small worker and farmer who think blue-white-red from
morning till night are not there,'' said French captain Didier
Deschamps.
	   ``The people who are there are not necessarily those who love
soccer,'' coach Aime Jacquet complained.
	   For all its futuristic splendor and fancy facilities, the
80,000-capacity Stade de France has failed to yield one key service
for the French team _ home advantage. The fans who get tickets just
don't have it.
	   This was obvious in the semifinal Wednesday against Croatia.
	   ``Two-thirds of the two grandstands were full of uptight
people,'' said Deschamps.
	   ``When we walked out of the tunnel, we saw nothing but people in
black suits and ties. It felt like a funeral,'' he said.
	   The way things were going, it almost turned out to be France's
burial.
	   When Les Bleus were suffering at the end of the first half and
needed a singleminded roar from crowd to get them through the
slump, they got an ``Ola-wave,'' at best.
	   ``It wasn't a public that carried us through. It was one that
just went along with things,'' Jacquet said diplomatically.
	   It got even worse when France was reduced to 10 men in the final
15 minutes and was under heavy pressure to hold onto their 2-1
lead.
	   ``The public scared me just by their lack of reaction,'' said
Charbonnier. He took the initiative and ran behind the goals to
fire up support. ``They lost heart.''
	   While the French remained stuck to their seats, he said, ``the
Croatian fans were all up,'' rooting for their underdog team.
	   The players and coach compared the blase reception at Stade de
France to the heartwarming scenes of public support elsewhere in
France, from city squares in the north to Mediterranean beaches in
the south.
	   For the opening game in Marseille, when the French media were
still putting question marks behind the quality of the team, true
fans never wavered.
	   During the tense stages of the second-round game against
Paraguay in the northern city of Lens, with potential elimination
only seconds away, the fans started their own rendition of ``La
Marseillaise'' to boost the players. France won.
	   The Stade de France, flush with celebrities and high-profile
business people, is different. It has become symbolic for the
transition of the game's working class roots to the glossy global
entertainment industry soccer is increasingly becoming.
	   ``What we need are the people who are outside,'' said Deschamps.
``Our 12th man is outside.''
	   The captain criticized the prices of tickets and the facilities
for sponsors that gobble up about a quarter of the available space.
	   ``It really bothers me. The access to the stadiums should be
open to true fans of soccer,'' he said.
	   It won't change for Sunday's final so the players are thinking
of some drastic measures.
	   ``Why don't they all cut off their ties,'' ventured Deschamps.
``It really makes me mad.''
	   ``They should put up a sign outside the Stade de France _ ``No
suits allowed. It's an offense to soccer'','' said defender Frank
Leboeuf.

Feuding Villeneuve and Schumacher turn down code of conduct
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout; adds quotes from Schumacher, Villeneuve &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SILVERSTONE, England (AP) _ Jacques Villeneuve and Michael
Schumacher turned down a suggestion Thursday that Formula One needs
a code of driving conduct.
	   Villeneuve, who says Schumacher's driving puts others ``at
risk,'' suggested instead taking matters into his own hands.
	   ``I think it would be very difficult to have a written code of
conduct,'' he said on the eve of Sunday's British Grand Prix.
	   ``It's very difficult from the outside to know what someone is
doing inside his car. You just need mutual respect. Once you know
what people do, then you just pay them back.''
	   Villeneuve, sitting three feet (one meter) away from Schumacher
_ and sporting new purple hair _ left little doubt about whom he
was speaking.
	   The Canadian criticized Schumacher's driving tactics in last
month's Canadian Grand Prix. In that race, Villeneuve's Williams'
teammate Heinz-Harald Frentzen was nearly forced off the track by
Schumacher.
	   ``Taking risks for yourself is one thing, putting other people
at risk is another thing,'' Villeneuve said about that race. ``It
goes beyond what I believe is acceptable.''
	   The Schumacher-Villeneuve feud goes back to the final race of
last season. In that race, Schumacher openly rammed Villeneuve as
the Canadian tried to overtake. Schumacher's car spun off the track
and Villeneuve went on to take the series championship.
	   The governing body of motor sport _ the FIA _ later slapped
Schumacher on the wrist for his action, stripping him of his
second-place finish in the final standings. Some suggested he
should have been banned for a season, or at least a few races.
	   Schumacher, six points off the series lead this season as he
goes for his third world title, Thursday called on the FIA for
stricter enforcement of the rules.
	   Ironically, some observers said it was the FIA's lax enforcement
that let Schumacher off the hook last season.
	   ``Some of the drivers I can imagine don't know now what is the
rule and what isn't the rule. And that's what has to happen,'' said
Schumacher, a two-time world champion.
	   ``The rule is the FIA _ and they have to give us the
guidelines.''
	   Sunday's British Grand Prix marks the start of the second half
of the season with Mika Hakkinen of McLaren Mercedes leading with
50 points. Schumacher's Ferrari has 44 with 30 for Hakkinen's
teammate David Coulthard.
	   Villeneuve, the defending series champion and back-to-back
winner of the British GP, has scored only 11 points for Williams.
	   ``I'm optimistic for a good finish,'' Villeneuve said. ``To
reach the McLarens and Ferraris is still a big step, but we're
getting closer and closer. At least it's a dog fight now.''
	   Villeneuve, rumored to be moving next season to the new British
American Racing team, admitted he might consider it.
	   ``If all the indicators were that it could be a winning
combination, then why not,'' he said. ``But you need to be assured
of many thing before you do that because it's a big risk.''
	   Asked when Williams wanted to know his plans, Villeneuve said
``pretty quick.''
	   Craig Pollock, Villeneuve's former manager, is British
American's general manager. The new team has reported financing of
200 million pounds (dlrs 330 million) over the next five years from
British American Tobacco.
	   Asked if he'd be returning next season to Ferrari, where he is
reported to earn about 20 million pounds (dlrs 33 million) in
salary alone, Schumacher replied, ``There is good reason that could
happen.''

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ A bomb exploded Thursday at a crowded
flea market in an Algiers suburb, killing 10 people and injuring
21, a communique from the hospital services said.
	   About 1,000 people were at the market when the bomb went off
about 9 a.m, causing people to run in panic in all directions away
from the market.
	   The explosive apparently was concealed in a shopping basket.
	   The attack came just before a march organized by the Front of
Socialist Forces to protest a law that bans all languages except
Arabic from official use.
	   Tens of thousands of people, many holding banners criticizing
the law and the violence wracking this North African nation, took
part in the march through Algiers.
	   The Front also wants the government to give official status to
the Tamazight language, which is used by Berbers, who make up about
one-third of Algeria's population.
	   The new law took effect Sunday. It is opposed by the Berber
community, which is still in shock over the murder last month of a
popular Berber singer. Islamic militants claimed responsibility for
that killing.
	   Many Algerians believe the government is seeking to appease
Islamic groups with the Arabic-only language law.
	   The Algerian government has been fighting an Islamic insurgency
since 1992 that has left an estimated 75,000 people dead, mostly in
bombings and massacres.
	   One of the leading ``emirs'' of the Armed Islamic Group, the
most violent movement in the insurgency, was killed by security
forces on Thursday, a government official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said.
	   Athmane Khelifa, who goes by the name ``Flicha,'' was killed in
hills outside Algiers, the official said. Khelifa was a leading GIA
official in the Algiers region.

Czech leaders sign cooperation pact
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with Havel saying he will probably name Zeman prime
minister; ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By NADIA RYBAROVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) - Czech President Vaclav Havel said
Thursday he will ``most probably'' name Social Democratic leader
Milos Zeman the country's new premier.
	   ``As soon as the current Cabinet resigns, I will most probably
name Mr. Zeman the new premier,'' Havel told journalists, after
meeting Zeman in his presidential residence outside Prague.
	   The president said, however, he would first seek an expertise on
whether an agreement Zeman signed with a rival party earlier in the
day does not contradict the constitution.
	   Under the agreement, former Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus's Civic
Democratic Party will allow Zeman's Social Democrats to form a
single-party minority government by leaving the chamber during the
initial confidence vote.
	   In exchange, Klaus' party will be allowed to appoint the
speakers of both chambers of Parliament and the chairmen of key
parliamentary committees.
	   Both parties also agreed not to initiate a non-confidence vote
during the lower chamber's four-year term and not to dissolve the
chamber before the term's end.
	   Each side also promised not to form a coalition or an alliance
with a third party to the detriment of each other's party.
	   The agreement immediately drew protests from two small
center-right parties who fear it will eliminate their influence in
the parliament.
	   Havel himself called the agreement a nonstandard solution,
adding he fears such an accord could lead to ``a permanent division
of power in the state.'' He also said he feared the agreement could
contradict some points of the constitution, calling this his ``main
worry.''
	   ``I would be happy if my worries do not prove true and ... I
could name Mr. Zeman premier,'' Havel said.
	   Zeman said the agreement was reached as ``the only way to
prevent another early election that would solve nothing in only a
few months.'' He blamed the smaller parties, the Christian
Democrats and the Freedom Union for the failure of his talks on a
majority government.
	   Zeman's center-left party won 74 of the 200 parliamentary seats
in the June 19-20 early elections, Klaus' Civic Democrats finished
second with 63 seats.
	   After the Christian Democrats and the Freedom Union rejected his
offers to join his Cabinet, Zeman settled on Klaus, his arch-enemy.

Italians do well in rain-interrupted claycourt classic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASTAD, Sweden (AP) _ Andrea Gaudenzi of Italy moved into the
quarter finals in the Swedish Open ATP claycourt classic by ousting
Spaniard Juan Antonio Marin 6-2, 7-5 Thursday.
	   Gaudenzi's less merited countryman Davide Sanguinetti was
battling 6th-seeded Swede Tomas Johansson for a spot in the
quarters when play was interrupted by increasing showers. Johansson
narrowly led Sanguinetti, who earlier upset Sweden's Mikael
Tillstrom, 6-7 (5-7), 6-3, 2-1, when the match was stopped for the
day.
	   Gaudenzi, after some rest, also teamed with fellow-countryman
Diego Nargiso to advance into the quarters of the doubles.
	   In other pre-rain action Moroccan Karim Alami advanced into the
quarters after a tough seesaw fight against Spanish qualifier
Fernando Vicente, 1-6, 7-6 (7-3), 6-4.
	   Australian Richard Fromberg from Tasmania, who won the title at
Bastad eight years ago, led 6-5 in the first set against Andrei
Medvedev when rain interrupted all play. The two incomplete matches
will be played Friday before quarter finals play is set to start.
	   If Johansson is upset by Sanguinetti, seven out of eight Swedish
players will be out and the remaining hope pinned on top-seed
Magnus Gustafsson, who is chasing his fourth Swedish Open title. He
lost a set Wednesday to Austrian qualifier Markus Hipfl.
	   In the quarters, scheduled to start around noon Friday on the
often windy seaside centercourt, Gustafsson will be heavily favored
against Jerome Golmard, a 24-year old Frenchman from Dijon with no
titles and a lowly 75th ranking on the ATP list.
	   If Gustafsson, who won here in 1991, 1992 and 1996 and has a
total of 11 titles, pulls through all the way he will not only
improve his current 26th ATP ranking but also be one up on fellow
Swedes Bjorn Borg and Mats Wilander, the only other players with
three titles.
	   Two other seeds were eliminated in Wednesdays action. The
defending champion, second-seed Magnus Norman of Sweden, joined
fourth-seed Magnus Larsson who exited Tuesday when he lost on the
home turf to unheralded Spaniard Fernando Vicente.

Investigation into church's finances chips away at secrecy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photo ATH105 &QL; 
 &UR; By THANASSIS CAMBANIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Orthodox church leaders called Thursday
for millions of dollars in missing money to be accounted for as
part of an ongoing investigation into the church's mysterious and
allegedly mismanaged finances.
	   An internal investigation that has lasted more than a year has
brought to light the literally Byzantine manner in which the
church's vast fortune is managed.
	   Archbishop Christodoulos, who took office in April, is using the
battle against negligence and embezzlement to show he's serious
about giving the Greek Orthodox Church a new image.
	   But the 450-page document detailing crimes from mismanagement to
theft from 1988 to 1996 has rekindled an old debate about the
church's untouchable status. Church leaders wield considerable
influence and often are more popular than political leaders.
	   A prosecutor is looking into the findings, and pressure is
mounting to make the report public. There also has been some
grumbling in Parliament that the church has been allowed to keep
its financial matters under wraps for too long.
	   Although so far only lay employees been implicated, the bishops
and metropolitans who supervise them will be held accountable,
church leaders said.
	   ``Clergy supervised lay employees and certainly are responsible
for being extremely negligent,'' said Metropolitan Maximos of
Serres, who spoke for the Holy Synod during its three-day meeting
about the financial report.
	   After the Holy Synod met Thursday, Church leaders said they had
asked two private citizens to return dlrs 2 million withdrawn from
church accounts.
	   Lay employees were given until Friday to return tens of
thousands of dollars more in missing or embezzled money.
	   ``No matter how much these findings may hurt the church, they
are beneficial,'' said Father Ignatius, a spokesman for the church.
``This investigation will create conditions so that such things
don't happen again.''
	   But many are wondering how deep the church is willing to cut to
remove financial corruption. The Orthodox Church is the largest
landowner in Greece and enjoys tax-free status.
	   The state pays the salaries of the country's 12,000 clerics and
gives large grants to restore monasteries and churches.
	   Estimates place the church's fortune _ which it won't reveal _
at about dlrs 1 billion.
	   ``There is no control,'' said Nitsa Loule, a leftist
Parliamentary deputy. ``No one oversees their budget, or how they
spend their money.''
	   Alleged scandals range from renovation grants spent for other
purposes to vast embezzlement schemes involving church property
leased in complicated scams.
	   Politicians recently backed off an a proposal to
constitutionally separate church and state. Orthodoxy is Greece's
official religion and more than 90 percent of the country is
baptized in the church.
	   A full conference of Greece's 80 bishops will meet in October
after examining the report. Afterwards, it may file criminal
charges.
	   For critics such as Loule, that's not enough.
	   ``Independent commissions should oversee all the church's
economics,'' she said. ``The church has enough money. They should
pay their own salaries.''

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ A bomb exploded in an abandoned
house at dawn Thursday, alerting police who arrested five people
with homemade bombs at the headquarters of the Puerto Rico
Telephone Co.
	   The explosion, which hurt no one, occurred just hours after
labor leaders ended the biggest strike in the U.S. territory's
history, one to protest the sale of the phone company.
	   Three young men and two 15-year-olds were found planting five
bombs made of acid, metal, keys and shards of glass at the
company's suburban Guaynabo offices, police Col. Adalberto Mercado
said.
	   He said police, who were on duty at the scene where picketers
remain day and night, were alerted when one of the saboteurs threw
a bomb that exploded in an abandoned house, apparently to test it.
	   The police, who suspect a clandestine pro-independence guerrilla
group in previous bomb plantings, identified the three adults
arrested as Alex Noel Ramos Vazquez, 21, Heriberto Olivera Vargas,
21, and Luis A. Morales Andaluz, 20.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak flew to
Libya Thursday to see Col. Moammar Gadhafi on a trip for which he
had permission to override a U.N. air embargo.
	   Mubarak was accompanied by several ministers, aides and a
medical team on the flight, which Egypt billed as intended to check
on the health of Gadhafi.
	   Libyan state-run television showed Mubarak greeting Gadhafi who
sat in a wheel chair. Gadhafi had an operation Monday on his hip
which he broke while exercising.
	   It was the first time the U.N. sanctions committee had given
approval for such a flight _ waivers are generally made for
humanitarian purposes only, U.N. officials said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   The air embargo was imposed in 1992 after Gadhafi refused to
hand over two Libyans suspected in the 1988 bombing of an American
airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland that killed 270 people.

Ronaldo borderline for best World Cup XI
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Sports-Soccer-All-Star Formation &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ He's scored four goals and set up at least two
others, but Ronaldo hasn't quite set the World Cup on fire as the
fans expected. With the final still to come he'd be a borderline
case for a World Cup All-Star team.
 &UR; Strikers &QC; 
	   Dutch striker Dennis Bergkamp looks more worthy of a place after
three standout goals and classy performances on the way to getting
his team to the semifinal.
	   Davor Suker hit five during Croatia's unexpected run to the last
four on its first appearance at the World Cup. While the
performance was a team effort, it couldn't have happened without
the Real Madrid striker's nose for goal chances.
	   Michael Owen, only 18, is still being applauded for his
astonishing solo goal against Argentina, even though England went
home more than a week ago. With his phenomenal pace and direct,
confident style of attacking defenses, Owen, who also scored as a
substitute against Romania, showed he has a huge future in the
game.
	   A two-time FIFA player of the year, Ronaldo has nothing to
prove. But even his coach and colleagues have noticed he hasn't
been quite as effective as usual at the World Cup.
	   ``He's still not the Ronaldo we all want to see,'' coach Mario
Zagallo said even after his star striker scored twice in the 4-1
second round win over Chile.
	   ``He has a lot more to give, and I'm sure we'll see it in the
games we have left.''
 &UR; Midfielders &QC; 
	   Ronaldo's national team colleague Rivaldo has been one of the
most effective attacking midfielders. The Barcelona star has scored
three times and unlocked defenses with his surging runs to open up
chances for his teammates.
	   Cesar Sampaio came into the World Cup as something of a
30-year-old journeyman player from Japan's J-League. He combined
solid, midfield performances with three well-taken goals to make a
big impact for the Brazilians especially in the early stages when
the team was knitting together.
	   Dutch midfielder Edgar Davids has excelled with his tireless
performances and tenacious tackling. The Juventus star also fired
the Dutch into the quarterfinal with a last-minute goal against the
Yugoslavs.
	   Argentina's Ariel Ortega was a livewire midfielder who burst
past opponents with his darting runs to open up goalscoring
chances. But his needless expulsion for headbutting Dutch
goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar in the quarterfinal would keep him off
an All-Star team.
 &UR; Defenders &QC; 
	   Likewise French defender Laurent Blanc, who pushed Croatia's
Slaven Bilic in the face and was expelled in the semifinal. Blanc,
who scored the first World Cup extra time ``Golden Goal'' to put
France into the last eight, would have made it to the team
alongside countryman Marcel Desailly.
	   The powerfully built Desailly, who has been playing in midfield
for AC Milan and has now moved on to Chelsea, let very little past
him in the six games he has played. Now he has to tangle with
Ronaldo and Bebeto in the final and the French are confident he can
handle the pressure.
	   Frank de Boer has been assured and confident on the ball in a
Dutch defense which was considered a weak point. Going forward, he
also set up Bergkamp's wonder goal in the final minutes against
Argentina with an accurately-aimed through ball from deep.
	   Sol Campbell showed a maturity far beyond his age of 23,
especially when the team had to play for 75 minutes against
Argentina after the expulsion of David Beckham. Campbell thought he
had headed England's winner but it was ruled out for a foul by
team-mate Alan Shearer and his team lost on penalties.
	   Lilian Thuram had performed consistently well on the right side
of defense for France even before he came up with his two semifinal
goals in the semifinal victory over Croatia.
	   It was Thuram who played Suker onside for the Croats' goal. But
he made up for it with a determined charge upfield to score the
equalizer a minutes later and hit the winner after winning back the
ball 20 meters from goal.
 &UR; Goalkeeper &QC; 
	   Based on previous performances, Taffarel came into the World Cup
considered a weak link in the Brazilian team. But the 'keeper, who
saved a penalty in the 1994 World Cup final shootout against the
Italians, got Brazil to the final again with two saves from the
spot against the Dutch. That also was in a shootout but he has also
looked secure in general play.
 &UR; Prospective all-stars &QC; 
	   Among the eye-catching players from the teams knocked out early
were Japan's 21-year-old orange-haired midfielder Hidetoshi Nakata,
who could become a star when his country co-hosts the 2002 World
Cup with South Korea, and Morocco's Moustafa El Hadji, scorer of a
memorable goal against Norway.

Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   National Weather Service forecast for Puerto Rico and the U.S.
Virgin Islands.
	   Clouds across the east this morning moved west and diminished
giving way to increased sunshine across the east. But clouds
increased across the interior and south portion of Puerto Rico.
Only a few light and spotty showers fell across the interior and
east. The U.S. Virgin Islands were mainly sunny and rain free.
Winds picked up out of the northeast to produce breezy and gusty
conditions across Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
	   Surface high pressure will continue to extend from the
east-central Atlantic southwest into the Bahamas through Friday
producing east to northeast winds across the islands. Southerly
winds around an upper high will continue to carry moisture in at
very high levels in the atmosphere. This will create a slightly
hazy appearance to the sky this afternoon. Surface heating and sea
breeze effects will produce thunderstorms out west, but the main
focus will be over the southwest since the winds are out of the
northeast.
	   The high pressure at high levels has pushed the upper trough
responsible for unstable conditions across our area to the distant
northwest. Therefore more of our normal weather will continue
through tonight. The gusty northeast winds will help to enhance
shower activity across the east to northeast overnight but will
remain isolated to widely scattered.
	   The fresh to strong northeast winds across the Caribbean and
Atlantic coastal waters has prompted a small craft advisory which
will remain in effect for this afternoon. Winds will begin to
diminish by Friday afternoon.

Former East German trade chief gets suspended sentence for
</HEADLINE>
technical imports &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Former East Germany's trade chief, who trial has
dragged on nearly three years due to illness, was found guilty by
the Berlin state court Thursday of illegal technology imports, and
give a one year and four months suspended sentence.
	   Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski, 66, was charged with acquiring
169 firearms and 233 night-vision devices and other technical
equipment through West German and Austrian companies in the 1980s.
	   He was also charged with transferring millions of marks
(millions of dollars) in East German funds to prevent it being
confiscated by West Germany, but was found not guilty on that
charge.
	   Schalck headed former East Germany's Foreign Trade Ministry's
commercial coordination bureau, known as KoKo, which handled the
purchase of high-tech, luxury and other goods, and the sale of East
German products to pay off state debts.
	   As its chief, Schalck moved in the highest East-West circles
arranging deals and was known to have contact with the late
Bavarian Governor Franz-Josef Strauss.
	   Since unification in 1990, Schalck has resided in Bavaria.
	   Schalck, who is suffering from cancer, which delayed the trial,
appeared for the verdict against doctor's orders to finally get it
over with, his lawyer Anke Mueller said.
	   During the trial he had argued that unified Germany's courts had
no right to try him for his actions as an agent of a sovereign
government.
	   He also maintained that most of the technical equipment he
obtained for the east Germans was for medical purposes.
	   Edgar Kutscheidt of west Germany was convicted in July 1994
helping Schalck by smuggling weapons worth dlrs 6 million into East
Germany from 1987 to 1989 and was sentenced to 3 years in prison.
He was released for health reasons after 13 months.

Mubarak defies U.N. embargo to fly to Libya
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES saying Egypt got U.N. permission for
flight; DELETES references to breaking U.N. sanctions &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak flew to
Libya Thursday to see Col. Moammar Gadhafi on a trip for which he
had permission to override a U.N. air embargo.
	   Mubarak was accompanied by several ministers, aides and a
medical team on the flight, which Egypt billed as intended to check
on the health of Gadhafi.
	   Libyan state-run television showed Mubarak greeting Gadhafi who
sat in a wheel chair. Gadhafi had an operation Monday on his hip
which he broke while exercising.
	   It was the first time the U.N. sanctions committee had given
approval for such a flight _ waivers are generally made for
humanitarian purposes only, U.N. officials said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   The air embargo was imposed in 1992 after Gadhafi refused to
hand over two Libyans suspected in the 1988 bombing of an American
airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland that killed 270 people.
	   Mubarak flew from Cairo to Al-Abrak town, 60 kilometers (37
miles) from the northern seaside town of Al-Bayda, Libyan
television said.
	   ``President Hosni Mubarak arrived aboard an Egyptian plane at
Al-Abrak civilian airport,'' a commentator on Libyan television
said in a live broadcast from Al-Abrak where Libyan officials gave
Mubarak a red carpet welcome.
	   Mubarak's visit was not announced and Egypt's official Middle
East News Agency only reported his arrival in Libya at about the
same time Libyan television started its live broadcast.
	   The broadcast was monitored in Cairo.
	   From Al-Abrak, Mubarak drove to Al-Bayda where he met with
Gadhafi who is recovering from surgery to repair a hip bone he
broke on Monday while exercising. Al-Bayda is 1,400 kilometers (865
miles) east of Tripoli, the Libyan capital.
	   The state Libyan television showed Mubarak shaking hands with
Gadhafi who sat on a wheel chair dressed in a golden brown
traditional Libyan gown. Mubarak also kissed Gadhafi on both cheeks
and inquired about his health.
	   Large crowds of Libyans greeted Mubarak on his arrival at the
Al-Abrak airport, the television said.
	   No reason was given for the visit, but Mubarak was believed to
have gone to Libya to wish Gadhafi a speedy recovery after his
surgery.
	   During their meeting, Gadhafi's doctors showed Mubarak three
X-rays of the broken hip.
	   Since the surgery on Monday, Gadhafi, 56, is reported to be in
good condition and resumed normal work on Wednesday, the Libyan
official news agency JANA said. Gadhafi's surgery was broadcast by
Libyan television on Tuesday.
	   Mubarak has visited Libya many times since 1992 but has always
driven across the Egyptian-Libyan border.
	   Last month, the Organization of African Unity urged member
states to ignore the sanctions for visits with humanitarian and
religious implications or those relating to official OAU work.
	   But until Thursday's flight by Mubarak, only Chad and Niger had
heeded the call, and Gadhafi twice canceled a visit to Egypt last
month, apparently angered by Egypt's refusal to let him fly to
Cairo.
	   Libya recently launched a campaign to win wider support from the
22-nation Arab League to lift the U.N. embargo. In September 1997,
the League had urged member states to ``take steps to ease the
toughness of the sanctions.''

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Here are excerpts from editorials in publications in various
countries:
	    &UR; ___
	   Liberation, Paris, on politics and soccer:
	   As much as the war that ravaged the Balkans, the World Cup has
put Croatia on the map. Make no mistake about it, soccer is a
political tool: behind the celebrations are nationalistic
aspirations.
	   For the young Croatia hoping to project a more democratic image,
gaining recognition on the playing field, as opposed to the
recognition they gained on the battlefield, would be the best flag
of all.
	   Miroslav Blazevic, colonel in the Croatian army reserves, former
coach of leading club Dinamo Zagreb and intimate friend of
Croatia's president Franjo Tudjman, is now his country's best
ambassador.
	   The team with the red checkerboard shirts wants its history
written with the path of a soccer ball, not with the deadly
etchings of the bullets and shells used against Serb and Montenegro
enemies, who were eliminated in the second round under the
Yugoslavian banner.
	    &UR; ___
	   Asahi Shimbun, Tokyo, on Kosovo:
	   There is the danger that the tense situation will spill over
into neighboring countries like Macedonia and Albania.
	   Even though sovereignty of a country is important, the principle
of non-intervention in internal affairs is no longer so sacrosanct.
The question is to solve the question by striking a balance between
the two. We want to think that Kosovo is a test case.
	   When international intervention is required, what procedures
must be taken? This is not a time for big powers to forcibly call
the shots. For the moment, the reliable basis for action is a
resolution of the U.N. Security Council.
	   In the case of Kosovo, use of military force of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization is being studied. Some in the United
States maintain that NATO troops can be used even without a United
Nations resolution. But European countries broadly agree that a
U.N. resolution is indispensable. We support the latter position.
	   Although the bloodshed in Bosnia was halted by NATO troops' air
strikes, military force is not a panacea. We cannot be too careful
in the use of force.
	    &UR; ___
	   Corriere della Sera, Milan, Italy, on international criminal
court conference in Rome:
	   With only two weeks left, delegates attending the international
criminal court conference in Rome are far from reaching a
satisfactory compromise. ...
	   Although agreed on conceptually, in reality the establishment of
an international criminal court raises radical objections.
	   The Pentagon and the Department of Defense do not agree to have
their military personnel subjected to an international court and
they oppose it vehemently, in spite of (President Bill) Clinton's
stand.
	   The Arab states, India and Mexico have their own reservations.
	   In general, several other countries hope that the Rome effort
will fail and that everyone will return to their countries and wash
the dirty laundry at home. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   Basler Zeitung, Basel, Switzerland, on Slobodan Milosevic:
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic can rest content. Western
diplomats are dancing in his direction.
	   Western threats towards the authoritarian Belgrade regime have
long been forgotten.
	   They are now limiting themselves to sending off diplomats on an
observer mission.
	   As Milosevic wants no foreign meddling, only diplomats who
already have approval from Belgrade can take part in the round
trip.
	   For years, Belgrade has put a stop to effective crisis
prevention in Kosovo.
	   Already, in 1993, observers from the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe were thrown out of the country.
	   In between, valuable years have passed by. The conflict has
developed into a small war, which threatens to envelop the entire
Balkan region.
	   With this background, the mission appears to all to be an
indication of Western helplessness. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   Clarin, Buenos Aires, on China:
	   It is not possible to conceive of a coherent world order without
that country which, within its borders, contains a quarter of all
humanity. The profuse show of friendship that China has received
from the West in recent years _ and which finds its latest
manifestation in the visit of President Clinton _ represents the
logical recognition of a historical and geopolitical reality. ...
	   Approaching China _ now more than ever _ is necessary to
maintain (channels) of possible pressure on Indian, Pakistan, Iran
and even Iraq. But, of course, closer ties with Beijing clash with
principles that cannot be ignored at all. The Asian giant continues
to remain distant from the canons that define democracy. And there
are no signs whatsoever that the political nature of the (Chinese)
regime is going to change in the near future. ... As a consequence,
Western ties with China should be advanced cautiously and along
clear lines.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Sydney (Australia) Morning Herald, on President Clinton and
China:
	   President Clinton tends to confuse image with reality. It was
inevitable, therefore, that his historic nine-day trip to China
would be dismissed by his political opponents and by most of the
commentators as an exercise in tickling the China tiger. The
criticism is that Clinton did not achieve any concrete results from
his meetings with China's President Jiang Zemin. The problem of
Chinese businesses stealing American and the rest of the world's
intellectual property in a vast range of goods from computer
technology to manufacturing was not really addressed. ... There was
little concession, either, even by way of rhetoric, regarding
improvement in human rights for dissidents in China. ...
	   Open, honest and fair governments, Clinton lectured the Chinese
leaders through his historic television debate with President Jiang
and later with a group of students, regulate and supervise markets
rather than direct them. Clinton directly related this theme to the
collapse of a number of the Asian tiger economies that had been
built, he argued, ``on the shaky foundations of cronyism,
corruption and over-extended credit.''
	   In foreign policy, as in other area of politics, ideas matter.
Clinton has set up the opening rhetorical shots in a critical
battle over ideologies. The China tiger may only have been tickled.
But a more rigorous confrontation is now possible.

UNDATED: now possible.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   The Straits Times, Singapore, on Japan's economy:
	   Last Friday on the campaign trail, Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto suggested that there might be permanent tax cuts to put
life back into the ailing Japanese economy.
	   On Sunday, he fudged and flip-flopped. Not for the first time.
Nor will this be the last. The world cannot but shake its head at
Japan's vacillating leadership. Mr. Hashimoto's prevarication on
tax cuts to boost consumer confidence shows how feeble and
indecisive he is.
	   Above all, he lacks political will. His action bespeaks the
problem of inertia, if not paralysis, at the top. This is an
economic crisis and the way he is going about dealing, or, to be
exact, not dealing with the ills of the economy gives little hope
that he can lead Asia's other floundering economies out of the sink
hole.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Jordan Times, Amman, Jordan, on the Middle East's arms race:
	   Israel's latest contribution to the accelerating arms race in
the Middle East involves the introduction of submarines capable of
firing nuclear missiles, ostensibly to deter surprise first-strikes
against the Jewish state's land-based nuclear arsenal, according to
recent press reports confirmed by the Pentagon. With this program,
Israel is intensifying the drive to set itself up as the police of
the entire region.
	   There is at present an international consensus that Israel
possesses the world's sixth largest nuclear arsenal; now it is
acquiring mobile nuclear-capable platforms. Surely this is enough
evidence that the Jewish state does have the means and will to use
such weapons.
	   The introduction of the submarines is certain to speed up, not
slow down, the regional trend of countries moving to acquire and
expand arsenals of non-conventional weapons.
	   It is unclear why Israel should want to take this step. Does the
region really need another vehicle of destruction? Or is this a
step to make the prophecy of Gog and Magog fighting it out on the
plains of Armageddon in the final battle self-fulfilling?
	    &UR; ___
	   Der Standard, Vienna, Austria, on EU:
	   The European Commission must be aware the majority of Austrians
fear eastward expansion of the EU.
	   It is hard to drive home the need for eastward expansion to the
gas station attendant at the eastern border, whose customers travel
over the border for cheaper gas.
	   But the gas station attendant will win indirectly ... because
'over there' prosperity will increase through ... a loosening of
trade regulations, allowing those eastern neighbors to sell
something other than gasoline.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Palm Beach Post, Palm Beach, Florida, on the AIDS
conference:
	   The euphoria that marked the 11th World AIDS conference in 1996
was missing ... as researchers gathered in Geneva for the 12th
international meeting. This year, the focus returned to the
epidemic's relentless march. ...
	   The hope sparked two years ago by protease inhibitors has also
dimmed. ... Two new drugs reduce the number of pills that must be
taken daily. But the drugs are expensive for developing countries,
which have 90 percent of HIV infections. ...
	   Worst of all, some countries still deny they have an AIDS
problem. ...
	   In America, denial remains strong in the group hardest hit today
_ African-Americans. ...
	   Surgeon General David Satcher blames black ministers and civil
rights groups for not speaking out more forcefully about what is
becoming ``an epidemic of color.'' ...
	   Prevention _ frank talk about transmission _ remains the only
sure way to avoid this fatal disease. International conferences can
be of little help if silence is allowed to fuel its spread.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Daily Times, Farmington, New Mexico, on foreign military
policies:
	   U.S. military presence in several of the world's hot spots,
necessary because of potential armed conflict, is not being aided
by the uncertainty of long-term diplomatic vision in the Clinton
administration.
	   There may well be an increase in tensions, despite U.S. Defense
Secretary Cohen's stated hope to the contrary, following the June
30 incident of an American F-16 firing on an Iraqi missile site
that had used radar to illuminate British jets flying over southern
Iraq. ...
	   There is nothing wrong with the firm military response made by
U.S. forces, but there is a distinct danger the Clinton
Administration will not prove capable of backing up such firm
actions in the long term. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   The Dallas Morning News, Dallas, on world criminal court:
	   ... Believe it or not, there is no permanent international court
to prosecute war crimes. The International Court of Justice, based
in the Netherlands, handles only civil matters.
	   The only international criminal courts have been temporary
structures established by the United Nations to deal specifically
with crimes committed during the recent civil wars in Bosnia and
Rwanda. In each case, they had to start from scratch: obtain
funding, find offices, hire a staff and, finally, deliberate.
	   This is no way to deter future Pol Pots. The world needs a
permanent war crimes court. The United States should fully
participate in the effort to create one. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   The Item, Sumter, South Carolina, on President Clinton's trip to
China:
	   President Clinton's China trip has been one an Oriental
potentate would appreciate. ...
	   We have no quarrel with the president of the United States
visiting and engaging Chinese leader Jiang Zemin in fruitful
discussion. ...
	   Clinton's joint press conference with President Jiang, hyped by
handlers and some members of a swooning press corps as a ``debate''
that featured a ``harsh exchange'' between the two leaders, was a
perfect opportunity for him to establish himself as an eloquent and
outspoken champion of human rights.
	   Unfortunately, a complete review of the joint meeting reveals a
cautious Clinton describing Tiananmen Square as a ``tragic loss of
life'' rather than a massacre. ...
	   In fact, the joint press conference was dominated by Jiang, who
laughingly claimed to have conducted a ``very earnest''
investigation into ``so-called political contributions in the
United States'' from the Chinese Government and found no evidence
of same.
	   Those remarks were undoubtedly welcomed by Clinton, who would
just as soon forget about the ``Chinese connection'' in his 1996
political campaign. ...

Italians do well in rain-interrupted claycourt classic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds. CORRECTS nationality of Marin in lead, inserts Gaudenzi*s
seeding  &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BASTAD, Sweden (AP) _ Andrea Gaudenzi of Italy moved into the
quarter finals in the Swedish Open claycourt classic by ousting
Juan Antonio Marin of Costa Rica 6-2, 7-5 Thursday.
	   Third-seeded Gaudenzi*s less merited countryman Davide
Sanguinetti was battling 6th-seeded Swede Tomas Johansson for a
spot in the quarters when play was interrupted by increasing
showers. Johansson narrowly led Sanguinetti, who earlier upset
Sweden*s Mikael Tillstrom, 6-7 (5-7), 6-3, 2-1, when the match was
stopped or the day.
	   Gaudenzi after some rest also teamed with fellow-countryman
Diego Nargiso to advance into the quarters of the doubles.
	   In other pre-rain action Moroccan Karim Alami advanced into the
quarters after a tough see-saw fight against spanish qualifier
Fernando Vicente, 1-6, 7-6 (7-3), 6-4.
	   Australian Richard Fromberg from Tasmania, who won the title at
Bastad eight years ago, led 6-5 in the first set against Andrei
Medvedev when rain interrupted all play. The two incomplete matches
will be played Friday before quarter finals play is set to start
	   If Tomas Johansson is upset by Sanguinetti seven out of eight
Swedish players will be out and the remaining hope pinned on
top-seed Magnus Gustafsson, who is chasing his fourth Swedish Open
title. He lost a set Wednesday to Austrian qualifyer Markus Hipfl.
	   In the quarters scheduled to start around noon Friday on the
often windy seaside centercourt Gustafsson will be heavily favored
against Jerome Golmard, a 24-year old Frenchman from Dijon with no
titles and a lowly 75th ranking on the ATP list.
	   If Gustafsson, who won here in 1991, 1992 and 1996 and has a
total of 11 titles, pulls through all the way he will not only
improve his current 26th ATP ranking but also be one up on fellow
Swedes Bjorn Borg and Mats Wilander, the only other players with
three titles.
	   Two other seeeds were eliminated in Wednesdays action. The
defending champion, second-seed Magnus Norman of Sweden, joined
fourth-seed Magnus Larsson who exited Tuesday when he lost on the
home turf to unheralded Spaniard Fernando Vicente.

Three-day strike call hangs over Spanish airports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spanish labor unions on Thursday announced
strike action intended to paralyze the nation's airports for three
key vacation days beginning July 31st.
	   The 72-hour strike call affecting all 41 Spanish airports came
just as Madrid's Barajas airport was recovering from weeks of
baggage chaos and constant delays triggered by technical problems
due to the introduction of a new traffic control system.
	   The unions have called the 8,000 workers employed by the
national airports authority out on strike because ``20 months of
talks have failed to produce any progress in the negotiation of a
new collective contract'' a union spokesman Francisco Valenzuela
said.
	   The authority's rejection of union demands for redefined job
descriptions and salary scales that recognize the new skills
workers are required to learn was the main cause of the stalemate,
Valenzuela said.
	   Air traffic controllers are expected to ignore the strike call.
The independent union representing some 1,400 controllers
negotiated a separate deal after strikes at the end of May forced
the cancellation of dozens of flights and affected an estimated
200,000 passengers.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ On a campaign poster, a liberal party says
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative political allies have become
so tough on immigrants that if Jesus showed up in Germany today,
he'd be deported.
	   The archconservative Christian Social Union accused the Greens
of going too far Thursday and demanded they withdraw the poster.
	   Their spat showcases the increasingly anti-foreigner tone of
Germany's national electionins lawmaker
Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, Kohl's former justice minister.
	   For years, Germans have argued over how to deal with their large
foreign population _ the biggest in Europe. But as the Sept. 27
vote approaches, mainstream political parties more and more are
taking a hard line on immigrants _ demanding that fewer be let in
and stricter rules for those already here.
	   They are responding to a spreading anti-foreigner sentiment,
evidenced most starkly in April with the shocking success of an
extreme-right party in the former communist east, where
unemployment is nearly 20 percent.
	   The German People's Union came from nowhere to win 13 percent of
the legislative vote in Saxony-Anhalt state with calls for
expelling ``foreign bandits'' and stressing ``German jobs for
Germans.''
	   Violence is also rising, after four years of decline. German
officials recorded 790 right-wing attacks last year, 27 percent
more than in 1996.
	   Most involved skinheads in the east beating up foreigners, whom
they accuse of stealing jobs or living off welfare and spreading
drugs and crime.
	   Some 7 million foreigners live in Germany, the vast majority of
whom work and pay taxes. Officials also say there's no significant
statistical difference in crime rates among Germans and foreigners.
	   Still, sensing the national mood, mainstream politicians have
been eager to show they can be tough on foreigners, too.
	   _Parliament's lower house last month voted by a wide margin to
trim millions of marks (dollars) in annual welfare benefits to some
refugees.
	   _Social Democratic chancellor candidate Gerhard Schroeder,
leading Kohl in the polls, has called for quick deportations for
foreigners who commit crimes, despite opposition from within his
traditionally leftist party.
	   _Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, of the liberal Free Democrats,
flew to the Balkans Thursday to check on the Kosovo crisis. Among
his top worries: ``a new stream of refugees'' to Germany.
	   This week, Kohl persuaded leaders of the archconservative
Christian Social Union, part of his governing coalition, not to
include the line ``Germany is not an immigration country'' in its
campaign platform, even though his own Interior Minister has
expressed similar views.
	   But Kohl signed on to the rest of the package, adopted
Wednesday, entitled: ``Effective Stemming of Undesired
Immigration.''
	   Among other demands, the paper calls for limiting the number of
foreigners in public housing and requiring foreigners to learn more
German if they want permission to stay here.
	   Some CSU members go further. The party's deputy general
secretary, Joachim Herrmann, suggested last week that Germany set
up separate facilities for desirable and undesirable foreigners.
	   Hermann said skilled people coming to work in Germany should not
have to stand in line to be processed with unwanted or criminal
types seeking entry.
	   Ignatz Bubis, head of the Central Council of Jews in Germany,
blasted the idea as akin to the live-or-die selection process at
Auschwitz.
	   And the latest broadside comes from the Greens and their Jesus
poster, which attacks Bavarian state Interior Minister Guenther
Beckstein for his alleged zeal in ordering deportations _ even to
places like Bosnia, where many refugees face hostilities.
	   The violet poster, 70 centimeters (28 inches) by 1 meter (39
inches), features only white lettering that reads: ``Beckstein
would also expel Jesus.''
	   The CSU leader in Bavaria, Alois Glueck, accused the Greens of
defaming Beckstein and of seeking to dictate which asylum policies
are Christian and which aren't _ a sensitive point in
overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Bavaria.
	   The Green party has said it would withdraw the poster only if
the CSU moderates its anti-immigrant stance, which also has met
criticism from other opposition parties and even from the Free
Democrats, junior partner in Kohl's coalition government.
	   CSU chairman Theo Waigel, who is Kohl's finance minister, called
the flap ``ridiculous'' Thursday and denied his party was echoing
the extreme-right slogan of ``foreigners out.''

Mubarak defies U.N. embargo to fly to Libya
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs, EDITS to conform with Mubarak's receiving U.N. permission
for visit; DELETES repetition of Gadhafi's hip operation; no
pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak flew to
Libya Thursday to see Col. Moammar Gadhafi on a trip for which he
had permission to override a U.N. air embargo.
	   Mubarak was accompanied by several ministers, aides and a
medical team on the flight, which Egypt billed as intended to check
on the health of Gadhafi.
	   Libyan state-run television showed Mubarak greeting Gadhafi who
sat in a wheel chair. Gadhafi had an operation Monday on his hip
which he broke while exercising.
	   It was the first time the U.N. sanctions committee had given
approval for such a flight _ waivers are generally made for
humanitarian purposes only, U.N. officials said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   The United Nations took note of the fact that Mubarak would be
visiting Gadhafi with a medical team, U.N. officials said.
	   The air embargo was imposed in 1992 after Gadhafi refused to
hand over two Libyans suspected in the 1988 bombing of an American
airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland that killed 270 people.
	   Mubarak flew from Cairo to Al-Abrak town, 60 kilometers (37
miles) from the northern seaside town of Al-Bayda, Libyan
television said in a broadcast monitored in Cairo.
	   ``President Hosni Mubarak arrived aboard an Egyptian plane at
Al-Abrak civilian airport,'' a commentator on Libyan television
said in a live broadcast from Al-Abrak where Libyan officials gave
Mubarak a red carpet welcome.
	   Mubarak's visit was not announced and Egypt's official Middle
East News Agency only reported his arrival in Libya at about the
same time Libyan television started its live broadcast.
	   From Al-Abrak, Mubarak drove to Al-Bayda where he met with
Gadhafi. Al-Bayda is 1,400 kilometers (865 miles) east of Tripoli,
the Libyan capital.
	   The state Libyan television showed Mubarak shaking hands with
Gadhafi and kissing him on both cheeks.
	   The Egyptian agency reported Mubarak's return early Thursday
evening, saying he had gone to Libya ``to be reassured of the
health of brother Moammar Gadhafi.''
	   The agency said nothing about how Mubarak traveled to Libya nor
that he had received permission from the United Nations.
	   Gadhafi, 56, is recovering well from his operation and resumed
normal work on Wednesday, the Libyan official news agency JANA
said. Footage of the operation was broadcast by Libyan television
on Tuesday.
	   During their meeting, Gadhafi's doctors showed Mubarak three
X-rays of the broken hip.
	   Mubarak has visited Libya many times since 1992 but has always
driven across the Egyptian-Libyan border.
	   Last month, the Organization of African Unity urged member
states to ignore the sanctions for visits with humanitarian and
religious implications or those relating to official OAU work.
	   So far only Chad and Niger have heeded the call. Their
presidents flew to Libya earlier this week.
	   U.N. officials said Thursday the Chad and Niger governments
neither requested nor received permission to fly to Libya.
	   Gadhafi twice canceled a visit to Egypt last month, apparently
angered by Egypt's refusal to let him fly to Cairo.
	   Libya recently launched a campaign to win wider support from the
22-nation Arab League to lift the U.N. embargo. In September 1997,
the League had urged member states to ``take steps to ease the
toughness of the sanctions.''

Brush fire burns near Acropolis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A fire raced through parched grass and
olive trees Thursday near ancient ruins at the foot of the
Acropolis, forcing tourists to dodge billowing smoke.
	   The blaze, which burned for about an hour, broke out between the
Roman Agora, or marketplace, and the Tower of the Winds _ a more
than 2,000-year-old pillar that served as a sundial and weather
vane.
	   Firefighters' trucks became stuck on the narrow, winding
streets, making it difficult for them to reach the blaze. Residents
used extinguishers and garden hoses to help fight the flames.
	   No injuries were reported. The cause of the fire was not clear.
	   More than 180 forest and brush fires have swept across Greece
since last week, burning dozens of homes and thousands of acres of
forest and farmland. At least two deaths have been blamed on the
fires.

Belarusians protest U.S. policies, diplomatic dispute
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARINA BABKINA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Communists and other presidential
supporters protested Thursday outside the U.S. Embassy, accusing
the United States of aggression towards Belarus.
	   The United States is among nine countries that have protested
orders from the Belarusian government to vacate ambassadors'
residences in a diplomatic compound in the suburb of Drozdy.
	   ``We are shocked by the story with Drozdy,'' said protester
Anatoly Voronkevich. ``The ambassadors must adhere to the laws of
the country where they stay.''
	   About 40 people took part in the picket, which was organized by
a movement supporting President Alexander Lukashenko. Lukashenko is
an authoritarian leader who wins praise at home for keeping order
and earns criticism abroad for stifling political opposition.
	   Lukashenko is a firm opponent of NATO and its expansion, and the
demonstrators tied the disputes together with placards that read
``Today you destroy Yugoslavia, tomorrow Belarus.''
	   Protest leaders gave the embassy petitions warning that the
``provocation'' would worsen relations with Belarus.
	   The picket came a day after Belarus eased its position on the
diplomatic compound, relaxing a deadline for ambassadors to move
their belongings out.
	   Moreover, a deputy foreign minister said even though Lukashenko
has declared the compound to be his personal residence, treaties
with the various countries are still in force.
	   ``Until the treaties between the embassies and the Belarusian
side are canceled... these are residences of the ambassadors,''
said Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Gerasimov.
	   Belarus has said it needs to repair the plumbing and sewage
system in the Drozdy compound. The ambassadors say Belarus has no
right to force them out for any reason.
	   Diplomats from the United States, Britain, Germany, France,
Greece, Italy, Japan, Bulgaria and Poland have all left Minsk in
protest.

Transportation Secretary discusses aviation standards in Africa
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ABEBE ANDUALEM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ U.S. Transportation Secretary
Rodney Slater met Thursday with Ethiopian officials to discuss the
improvement of aviation standards in Africa as part the Africa Safe
Skies initiative proposed by President Bill Clinton.
	   Slater's stop in Ethiopia was his second on an eight-day African
tour to promote better civil aviation practices and expand Africa's
air links with the United States.
	   During his 12-day tour in March, Clinton stressed the importance
of aviation in U.S. efforts to boost trade and economic relations
with African nations.
	   Before leaving Washington Tuesday, Slater said his goal was to
increase the number of African airports that meet international
aviation standars as well as the number of direct flights to the
United States.
	   International pilots' associations and civil aviation bodies
have expressed concern about low standards in air traffic control
and safety at many of Africa's commercial airports.
	   In Addis Ababa, Slater delivered a message from Clinton to Prime
Minister Meles Zenawi stressing the importance of continuing to
build U.S.-Ethiopian cooperation despite the two-month
confrontation between Ethiopia and Eritrea over disputed border
areas.
	   Both Horn of Africa countries have enjoyed good relations with
Washington.
	   ``Despite the current dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea, it
is important that we continue to advance U.S.-Ethiopian
cooperation,'' Clinton wrote in a letter distributed to reporters.
	   Slater also signed a dlrs 100,000 grant to Ethiopian Airlines,
the national carrier, for flight simulators to train pilots on the
Boeing 757 and 767 model aircraft, which will facilitate
certification by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.
	   ``The simulators will be the only ones outside the U.S. to be
certified by the FAA,'' Slater told a news conference at the
headquarters of Ethiopian Airlines.
	   Until Kenya Airways and Nigerian Bellview began flights to Lagos
earlier this year from Nairobi, Ethiopian was the only airlines
linking eastern and western Africa.
	   Since the inauguration of direct service to Washington via Rome
on June 4, the 52-year-old airline is the only one flying from
eastern Africa to the United States.
	   Slater was to leave for Harare, Zimbabwe later Thursday to chair
a conference of eastern and southern African transport ministers on
the Safe Skies project. He will chair a similar meeting in Dakar,
Senegal for western and central african transport ministers.
	   Slater's visit began in Cape Verde and will also include stops
in Luanda, Angola and Yaounde, Cameroon.

Top seed Novotna advances to quarterfinals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Wimbledon champion Jana Novotna
defeated her compatriot Radka Bobkova 6-2, 7-6 (7-3) Thursday to
advance into the quarterfinals of the dlrs 160,000 Skoda Czech Open
ladies tournament.
	   Top-seeded Novotna lived up to her role as tournament favorite
in the first set, before she began to lose steam in the second one.
	   Bobkova, ranked 123rd on the WTA Tour, was trailing Novotna 0-4,
but fought back to level the score 6-6. She eventually lost the set
in a tie-break.
	   Novotna capitalized on her powerful serve and traditionally
efficient play on the net to keep the upper hand throughout the
match.
	   ``I played better than in the first round but I was still tired
from Wimbledon,'' she said after the match.
	   Novotna moves on to face Sarah Pitkowski of France, who beat
Romania's Ruxana Dragomir 7-5, 6-3, in Friday's quarterfinals.
	   In other second-round action Thursday, Wimbledon semifinalist,
fourth-seed Natasha Zvereva of Belarus beat 18-year-old Czech
Michaela Pastikova, 7-5, 3-6, 6-1 after a two-hour battle.
	   Second seed Sandrine Testude of France beat the Czech Republic's
Denisa Chladkova 7-6 (8-6), 7-5, Amelie Mauresmo of France ousted
Elena Makarova of Russia 7-5, 6-1, and Italy's Silvia Farina
rallied to beat Asa Carlsson of Sweden 7-5, 4-6, 6-1.

Coke to recall soft drink bottles contaminated by paint thinner
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Coca-Cola in Israel has recalled plastic
bottles of the soft drink nationwide after several were found to be
contaminated with paint thinner, the Health Ministry said Thursday.
	   Dr. Gabi Barabash, director general of Israel's health ministry
said five families from Rehovot, southwest of Tel Aviv, became ill
from bottles bought at a local grocery store which were
contaminated by a paint thinner.
	   Three daughters from one of the families remained hospitalized
for observation Thursday and a family in Haifa also reported a
suspect bottle, Israeli media reported.
	   Yitzhak Tamir, the deputy director of Coca-Cola in Israel said
that although the company was convinced the problem was limited to
the one Rehovot supermarket, they had to decided to recall all
15,000 1.5 liter bottles with an expiration date of October 7,
1998.
	   In an interview with Israel Radio, Tamir said that tests inside
Coke's Israeli factory revealed that the contamination could not
have happened during production. The Israeli police department and
Coke said they were carried out lab tests and would further
investigate the incident.

Mubarak defies U.N. embargo to fly to Libya

Swiss diplomat accuses New York finance chief of `intimidation
</HEADLINE>
tactics' &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ The Swiss diplomat heading the
country's task force on its wartime past Thursday accused New York
City's finance chief of ``manipulations'' and ``intimidation
tactics'' in the controversy over Holocaust assets.
	   New York City Comptroller Alan Hevesi was ``in clear
contradiction with the facts'' to claim the Swiss government had
broken a promise to take part in a settlement, said Thomas Borer.
	   In a strongly worded letter to Hevesi, Borer rejected Hevesi's
assertion last week that the Swiss government was ``misleading
millions of Swiss.''
	   Borer denied that the Swiss government had ever agreed to take
part in negotiations.
	   ``Such manipulations typify the way the way Switzerland has been
treated by some quarters since the beginning of the controversy,''
Borer said.
	   Hevesi said a commission he chairs advising hundreds of city and
state finance officials had decided to recommend sanctions after a
Swiss government representative said Switzerland ``will never,
ever'' participate in negotiating a settlement of Holocaust
survivors' claims against Swiss banks.
	   ``Intimidation tactics like this can only recall the most
flagrant propaganda methods,'' Borer said. ``They will certainly
not help resolve this most important issue.''
	   Borer pointed to a survey published Sunday which showed 70
percent of Swiss in favor of concerted diplomatic moves against any
sanctions and 61 percent for a protest to the World Trade
Organization.
	   He regretted a turn of events ``which cannot in any way be in
the interest of the Holocaust survivors.''
	   Switzerland's three biggest banks made what they said was their
final offer of dlrs 600 million last month. Jewish leaders said
they should be paying more than dlrs 1 billion.
	   Hevesi and State Comptroller H. Carl McCall announced plans to
bar investments with Swiss banks from Sept. 1 if no settlement is
reached. Other states have also announced sanctions plans.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Ukrainian Foreign Minister Borys Tarasyuk
and Canadian Minister of National Defense Arthur Eggleton met
Thursday to discuss military and political cooperation, the Foreign
Ministry said.
	   The ministers praised Ukrainian-Canadian relations and discussed
Ukraine's relations with NATO, nuclear non-proliferation and other
issues, the ministry said.
	   During his two-day visit, which began Wednesday, Eggleton also
met with Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksandr Kuzmuk and offered
his country's help to Kiev in eliminating land mines.
	   Ukraine has eliminated some 100,000 mines without joining the
Ottawa Treaty on eliminating the weapons, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said. Eggleton ``was impressed by the results,'' said Ukrainian
Defense Ministry spokesman Valentyn Korol.
	   Eggleton said Canada would take part in the NATO-linked Sea
Breeze-98 exercises later this year and would discuss the
possibility of sending its troops to the 204th Ukrainian-Polish
peacekeeping battalion.
	   The Canadian minister also was due to visit an airfield near
Kiev and the Antonov aircraft design bureau.
	   On Friday, Eggleton was to travel to a training range near the
western city of Lviv to familiarize himself with the activities of
the 204th battalion unit.

	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ Former President Kenneth Kaunda submitted
his resignation Thursday as leader of Zambia's biggest opposition
party, five weeks after he was released from house arrest when
coup-related charges against him were dropped.
	   Kaunda's United National Independence Party must now formally
accept the resignation or ask the 74-year-old Kaunda to reconsider
and stay on. If the party agrees Kaunda should go, it would

World Cup: FIFA says defender misses final despite French appeal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS criticism that referees ignore play-acting &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ FIFA Thursday banned Laurent Blanc for two games,
confirming that the French defender was out of Sunday's World Cup
final against Brazil.
	   The suspension, which also will rule him out of France's first
qualifying game of the next European Championship, can't be
appealed.
	   But it comes amid criticism that World cup referees are taking
no action against players guilty of feigning injury or play-acting.
	   The Olympic Marseille star, who has played 74 times for France,
was sent off for the first time in his long career for pushing
Croatian defender Slaven Bilic in the face Wednesday as the two
prepared to chase a free kick.
	   Although there were claims that Bilic, who tumbled to the ground
clutching his face, may have been guilty of play-acting to get the
Frenchman sent off, FIFA said the red card and the suspension
stayed.
	   Reacting to French officials who said earlier they would appeal
any suspension, FIFA said that, unless there was a case of mistaken
identity and it wasn't Blanc who committed the offense, there was
no chance of the ban being dropped.
	   ``A one or two-game ban can't be appealed against,'' said FIFA
spokesman Marius Schneider. ``Only a suspension of three games or
more can be appealed.
	   ``The disciplinary committee doesn't have the power to relieve
him of a suspension for this match.''
	   FIFA, which is holding a referee-relating news briefing on
Friday, likely will come under criticism for the performance of the
officials here.
	   ``These players at the World Cup deserve Oscars for their acting
and their actions have brought about the demise of refereeing
standards at France 98,'' said England's former FIFA referee, Roger
Milford.
	   ``While technically-speaking the offence by Blanc was a
sending-off offense, irrespective of severity, there is no doubt
Bilic made a meal of it.''
	   FIFA regarded Blanc's action as violent conduct and has
suspended other players, such as Dutch striker Patrick Kluivert and
Argentina's Ariel Ortega, for more than one game for similar
conduct.
	   Blanc was clearly shown to push Bilic in the face after the two
players had tugged each other shirts. The French felt it was a
yellow rather than a red card offense.
	   ``It was unjust, it was too harsh of the referee,'' French coach
Aime Jacquet said of the expulsion.
	   ``We will appeal but we fear it will be a formality. We always
have hope but I don't want to give Blanc any false hope.''
	   Blanc, scorer of the extra time ``Golden Goal'' against Paraguay
that put the French into the quarterfinal, said he wasn't confident
either that a suspension could be avoided.
	   ``It would be a great surprise,'' he said. ``It would be
unique.''
	   But he's still upset.
	   ``My expulsion punishes the player but the really bad scenario
is that it also punishes the team. I have this feeling of having
tasted the cake, but now I'm not allowed to touch the cherry,''
said Blanc.
	   Bilic said that Blanc's red card was all his own fault.
	   ``I didn't get him sent off, he did,'' the Everton defender
said.
	   ``He touched me, technically that's an offense, and the referee
saw it.
	   ``I'm not happy that he's going to miss the final, but if you do
something like that you're going to get punished. That's all there
is to say about it.''

Russia seeks new loan from international lenders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS and UPDATES thruout with Chubais comments, market
close and reax, report on devaluation. Changes byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A government negotiator said Thursday he expects
to settle all major issues this week in talks with two Western
lending agencies, which are drafting plans to bail out Russia's
sinking economy.
	   Anatoly Chubais, the government's lead negotiator in meetings
with the lending agencies, said he had reached a ``decisive'' stage
in talks with the World Bank and hoped to iron out any remaining
problems with the International Monetary Fund on Friday.
	   Chubais met with the two international lending agencies again
Thursday, but there was no word on the specifics of the talks.
	   Russia says it needs dlrs 10 billion to 15 billion in new loans
to restore confidence in financial markets that have been in a
tailspin for months.
	   However, it's not clear that it will get that much, and it's not
clear when it will get anything.
	   The IMF and World Bank may be reluctant to finalize any loan
deal until Russia's parliament approves an economic stabilization
package proposed by President Boris Yeltsin's administration.
	   Parliament's lower house is not scheduled to meet again until
July 15, and the Communists and other opposition members have
strong reservations about measures that would raise taxes.
	   The lending agencies consider improved tax revenues to be the
key to a Russian recovery. The government has pledged to improve
tax collection. It said Thursday that tax revenues for June were
11.2 billion rubles (dlrs 1.8 billion), up 600 million rubles (dlrs
100 million) from May. Customs collections were slightly down,
however.
	   Russian stocks inched upward Thursday, but trading was minimal.
Most investors are waiting to see what the IMF and World Bank will
do.
	   Gary Kinsey, a trader at the Brunswick Warburg brokerage, said
the market is edgy about the prospects for a devaluation of the
ruble if the lending agencies don't come up with enough cash to
support the Russian currency.
	   ``Nobody knows what the fallout would be of a real
devaluation,'' he said.
	   One organization took a stab at it. The Association of Russian
Banks calculated that devaluation would cost the country's banks
more than 50 billion rubles (dlrs 8.3 billion) _ a sum 2.5 times
their total pretax profits, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   However, Yeltsin continued to insist that the government could
maintain the ruble's value.
	   ``We will firmly keep the ruble from devaluation,'' Yeltsin told
reporters in the Kremlin.
	   Thursday's talks with the World Bank focused on a structural
adjustment loan that would give the Russian government dlrs 600
million to dlrs 800 million in budget support, officials said.
	   The government would like the loan as soon as possible to deal
with a wide range of problems. Millions of workers have to wait
months for their salaries. Labor unrest is on the rise. The Russian
stock market has fallen by more than half so far this year, and
foreign investors are fleeing in droves.

Solana visits Ukraine to mark one year of cooperation charter

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana marked
one year of NATO's partnership charter with Ukraine on Thursday,
meeting with top Ukrainian officials and praising their efforts to
work with the alliance.
	   ``It has been a very positive year,'' Solana said. ``In the
construction and structure of security on the continent, Ukraine
has continued to play a fundamental role.''
	   ``The stability, security and prosperity (in Europe) is
impossible without strong relations between Ukraine and NATO,''
Solana told reporters.
	   Ukraine signed a special cooperation charter with the U.S.-led
alliance exactly one year ago and has eagerly hosted and
participated in peacekeeping maneuvers under NATO's Partnership for
Peace program.
	   Some Ukrainian officials have said the country may eventually
seek NATO membership. The government formally says, however, that
it only wants close relations with NATO.
	   Russia, Ukraine's giant northern neighbor, has vehemently
opposed any of the former Soviet republics joining NATO.
	   The top NATO official met with Defense Minister Oleksandr
Kuzmuk, Security Council secretary Volodymyr Horbulin and other
officials, and later in the day held prolonged talks with President
Leonid Kuchma.
	   The sides discussed military, technological and scientific
cooperation as well as peacekeeping and joint work in dealing with
civil emergencies.
	   ``We shall have cooperation not only in military issues, not
only in the Partnership for Peace program but in many other''
spheres, said Kuchma, who hailed Ukraine's cooperation with NATO as
``fruitful and constructive.''
	   The sides also agreed on the appointment of a NATO liaison
officer to Ukraine, the first step toward opening a mission that
could negotiate military contacts with the former Soviet republic,
according to Ukraine's Foreign Ministry.
	   Ukrainian officials praised Solana's visit. Underlining its
importance, a full military guard greeted Solana at the ornate
Mariinsky Palace where he met with Kuchma.
	   The Foreign Ministry said Ukraine plans to focus future
cooperation with the alliance on a variety of military and
technical issues, such as joint design of weapons and military
conversion projects.
	   Ukraine also wants to cooperate with NATO in space research, it
said.
	   From Kiev, Solana traveled later Thursday to the eastern
Ukrainian city of Dnipropetrovsk, where he visited the huge
Yuzhmash rocket plant.
	   Solana said he was happy that the once-secret plant was no
longer producing weapons such as the Soviet SS-18 nuclear missiles,
the Interfax news agency reported.
	   ``And the former director of the plant is serving his nation as
president of democratic and sovereign Ukraine,'' Solana added in
reference to Kuchma, Yuzhmash's former boss.

 &UR; Yugoslavia to allow OSCE mission to visit next week &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ In what a U.S. diplomat termed a ``step
in the right direction,'' Yugoslavia has agreed to let an
international mission visit rebellious Kosovo province, officials
said Thursday.
	   Yugoslavia had refused to allow a mission from the 54-nation
Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe, or OSCE, to
visit the country until Belgrade's membership in the group was
restored.
	   The United States and key European countries have been demanding
for months that the Yugoslavs allow the mission into the country as
part of diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis in Kosovo, where
ethnic Albanians are fighting for independence.
	   Sources in the OSCE, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the organization decided Thursday to accept an offer by the
Yugoslavs for limited-duration visit to Kosovo and other parts of
the country.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, which along with Montenegro
forms Yugoslavia.
	   According to the sources, U.S. representative David Johnson told
the OSCE meeting the Yugoslav offer was a ``step in the right
direction'' and could pave the way for a longer term mediation by
the group's special envoy, former Spanish Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez.
	   In the Yugoslav capital Belgrade, the private Beta news agency
quoted government spokesman Ivica Dacic as saying the invitation
was made as a ``goodwill gesture'' and that the OSCE team would
stay about a week.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Maybe investors should mail a thank-you note to
Hallmark Cards, which agreed Thursday to snap up British rival
Creative Publishing PLC for 188 million pounds (dlrs 306 million)
in cash.
	   The deal would create Britain's biggest greeting card group,
with a market share approaching 30 percent. The announcement sent
Creative Publishing shares soaring on the London Stock Exchange.
	   Hallmark bid 233 pence (dlrs 3.80) per share, or 37 percent more
than Creative Publishing's closing price on Wednesday. Creative
Publishing finished just slightly shy of the bid price, closing at
227 pence (dlrs 3.70) per share.
	   There were reports in London suggesting that Hallmark's U.S.
rival, American Greetings, might try to enter the fray with an
unsolicited bid, but Hallmark and Creative Publishing sought to
play down the idea.
	   ``I'm not aware of it,'' Creative Publishing chairman Keith
Chapman said by telephone. ``We've had talks with them through the
years, but nothing recent.''
	   Hallmark characterized rumors of a rival bid as ``a speculative
game'' and said it had offered ``a full and fair price.''
	   American Greetings declined comment on what spokesman Jim King
also termed ``speculation.''
	   King noted that his company, based in Cleveland, Ohio, had
already made a big expansion this year in the British greeting
cards business by purchasing two competitors, Hanson White and
Camden Graphics.

Top seed Novotna advances to quarterfinals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Wimbledon champion Jana Novotna
defeated her compatriot Radka Bobkova 6-2, 7-6 (7-3) Thursday to
advance into the quarterfinals of the dlrs 160,000 Skoda Czech Open
ladies tournament.
	   Top-seeded Novotna lived up to her role as tournament favorite
in the first set, before she began to lose steam in the second one.
	   Bobkova, ranked 123rd on the WTA Tour, was trailing Novotna 0-4,
but fought back to level the score 6-6. She eventually lost the set
in a tie-break.
	   Novotna capitalized on her powerful serve and traditionally
efficient play on the net to keep the upper hand throughout the
match.
	   ``I played better than in the first round but I was still tired
from Wimbledon,'' she said after the match.
	   Novotna moves on to face Sarah Pitkowski of France, who beat
Romania's Ruxana Dragomir 7-5, 6-3, in Friday's quarterfinals.
	   In other second-round action Thursday, Wimbledon semifinalist,

Israel demolishes five Palestinian structures in the West Bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ The Israeli army demolished five
Palestinian structures in the West Bank Thursday built without
Israeli-issued permits, an official said.
	   Two warehouses, and three partially built homes were destroyed
outside the Palestinian-run city of Ramallah, said Peter Lerner, a
spokesman for the Israeli military in the West Bank.
	   Lerner said that one of the houses was demolished after Israel's
Supreme Court rejected an appeal by the family to save it.
	   Palestinians complain that Israel uses house demolitions as a
political tool and refuses to issue building permits in areas of
the West Bank it wants to keep under its control.
	   The United States has said house demolitions send the wrong
signal to the Palestinians at a time when trust between the sides
is low and Israeli-Palestinian peace talks remained deadlock
despite American efforts to revive them.
	   After the demolitions, some 100 Palestinians held a protest
outside the Jewish settlement of Beit-El near Ramallah. The Israeli
government has said it would not limit growth for the settlements
and would allow building there.

Rwandan rebels kidnap one Canadian, two Rwandan nuns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Hutu rebels kidnapped a Canadian and two
Rwandan Roman Catholic nuns in an attack in northwestern Rwanda
that also left a local official dead, area residents said Thursday.
	   The residents told the Kinyarwanda language service of the
British Broadcasting Corp. _ which is broadcast to Rwanda _ that
the rebels attacked Bungwe, 60 kilometers (35 miles) north of
Kigali in Byumba Prefecture, Tuesday evening where they killed the
official, robbed a bank and attacked a Roman Catholic mission.
	   It was not immediately possible to obtain comment from Rwandan
authorities. The Canadian Embassy in Kigali confirmed that the
Canadian nun, a long-time resident of Rwanda, was among the three
kidnapped. Neither her name nor her home town were immediately
available.
	   The residents said the attackers escaped pursuing government
soldiers and managed to disappear into heavily forested neighboring
Ruhengeri Prefecture where they are believe to have bases.
	   Thousands have died in rebel attacks since the return in
November 1996 of more than 1 million Hutu refugees from exile.
Among them were former Hutu soldiers and militiamen responsible for
the 1994 Hutu-organized genocide of more than 500,000 minority
Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus.
	   Tutsi-led rebels overthrew the Hutu extremist government in July
1994 and stopped the killing.
	   In March, the rebels kidnapped three Spanish nuns, who were
later released unharmed.

 &UR; International observers complete first mission amid lull in combat &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Yugoslavia allowing OSCE mission;
Albanians holding ground after Serb attacks; CHANGES byline &QL; 
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JUNIK, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian rebels held their
ground Thursday near Kosovo's border with Albania after two days of
attacks by Serb security forces. International observers took
advantage of the lull to tour flashpoints in the province.
	   In Vienna, Austria, the Organization of Security and Cooperation
in Europe, or OSCE, said Yugoslavia had agreed to let an OSCE
delegation visit the country, including Kosovo, for about 10 days
as part of international efforts to end the crisis.
	   Yugoslavia has refused to accept OSCE mediation until its
membership in the 54-member organization is restored. Although the
Yugoslav agreement falls short of accepting OSCE mediation, U.S.
and European officials termed the invitation a step in the right
direction.
	   The United States and the Europeans are trying to prevent the
conflict from spreading to other Balkan countries with substantial
Albanian communities.
	   But those countries oppose independence for Kosovo _ a province
of Serbia _ as demanded by both Kosovo's Albanian moderate
politicians and the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army. Serbia is part of
Yugoslavia.
	   Albanian sources reported scattered shelling Thursday by Serb
near the southwestern Kosovo town of Djakovica. There were no
reports of casualties nor confirmation by government sources.
	   Outside the border town of Junik, 20 kilometers (12 miles) north
of Djakovica, a local KLA officer, Gani Shehu, said two of his
fighters were wounded during two days of Serb attacks which ended
Wednesday.
	   Shehu said casualties were apparently much higher, however, in
the nearby town of Morina, which also came under Serb mortar,
artillery and infantry attacks Tuesday and Wednesday. Shehu said
communications to the area had been cut.
	   It appeared the Serbs were trying to seal off KLA supply lines
to nearby Albania, the rebels' major source of weapons and
ammunition.
	   About a dozen diplomats and military personnel from the United
States, Russia, the Netherlands, Belgium and Britain toured parts
of western Kosovo on Thursday as part of what U.S. officials say
will be a series of visits throughout the province.
	   The visits are designed in part to reassure both Albanian and
Serb civilians that the world has not abandoned them. The visits
are also aimed at gathering first hand information about the
conflict, in which hundreds have been killed since late February.
	   The United States and European countries have demanded an
immediate cease-fire and have threatened to crack down on the flow
of funds to the KLA from Albanian communities abroad.
	   Those countries want the rebels to accept moderate ethnic
Albanian politician Ibrahim Rugova as the leader in future talks
with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on the future of the
province.
	   Rugova also supports independence but has rejected violence.
That has so far made him unacceptable to the guerrillas.
	   ``For nine years, Rugova has been calling for dialogue,'' Naim
Maloku, a top KLA commander in western Kosovo, said in an interview
published Thursday by the Albanian language daily Koha Ditore.
``The war has been imposed on us. We had no other way out.''
	   In neighboring Albania, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
repeated calls for the Kosovo Albanians to accept Rugova and end
the violence. Kinkel also warned the rebels that ``the secession of
Kosovo will not be supported by the international community.''
	   He said the Europeans were studying ways to help stop the flow
of arms into Kosovo and reminded the Albanian government that it
``has a special responsibility'' to halt the violence.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Officials announced a flood alert on
Thursday in part of the southeastern Przemysl province, after a few
farms and some local roads were flooded, private nationwide Radio

the situation is being closely monitored. Rescue workers have been
alerted.
	   More rain was forecast, Olbrych said.
	   Last year's floods in southern and western Poland, claimed 55
lives, swamped 46,000 homes and caused an estimated 12 billion
zlotys (dlrs 3.4 billion) in damage.

Crunch time approaches at U.N. meeting on world court
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIEL J. WAKIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ It's crunch time at the U.N. conference to set up a
global criminal court.
	   With a week left in marathon negotiations, a first draft of the
treaty establishing the tribunal was expected to be in the hands of
delegates Friday.
	   But the battle won't be over.
	   Agreement is near on most of the nuts and bolts issues, such as
rules of procedure and cooperation between governments, the court's
composition and administration.
	   However, the draft will leave unresolved some of the fundamental
political issues that have been the subject of contentious debate:
the independence and power of the prosecutor.
	   The deadline for the five-week conference is July 17.
	   At stake is a permanent tribunal that would pursue cases of
genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.
	   Such a court would culminate decades of efforts growing out of
the Nuremberg and Tokyo tribunals that followed World War II. It
would create a permanent substitute for the more recent ad hoc
prosecutions of war criminals -- the accused killers, torturers and
rapists of former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.
	   ``This is it. It's now or never for an effective, independent
international court,'' said Richard Dicker of Human Rights Watch.
	   Over the past several days, delegations have been stating stands
on the key issues. On Thursday, it was the turn of the United
States, which showed some flexibility but also a tough line on
limiting the court's scope.
	   That infuriated members of the human rights community, who have
been major lobbyists here for the most powerful court possible.
Dozens of other nations, including U.S. allies like Britain and
Canada, are at odds with Washington at the conference.
	   The United States would reject a treaty and would even
``actively oppose this court'' if it were granted ``universal
jurisdiction,'' even over non-treaty signers, said chief U.S.
delegate David J. Scheffer.
	   ``Actively opposing'' could mean refusing to cooperate in
investigations or persuading allies not to, said Scheffer, who is
the U.S. human rights ambassador.
	   Washington also opposes allowing the prosecutor to go after
suspects of war crimes and crimes against humanity unless signing
countries give consent. Genocide would be fair game without
consent.
	   The crux of American concerns are exposing U.S. soldiers,
whether stationed abroad or carrying out peacekeeping operations,
to politically motivated charges.
	   The U.S. stance ``would prevent the future Pol Pots from ever
being tried and convicted,'' said Jelena Pejic, an attorney for the
New York-based Lawyers Committee for Human Rights.
	   The United States did signal it would compromise on the issue of
U.N. Security Council control over launching prosecutions.
Originally, it wanted the council to trigger cases. As a permanent
member with veto power, it would thus have veto power over court
actions.
	   On Thursday it signaled flexibility, suggesting it would accept
a compromise giving the Security Council mainly the power to
suspend, with a unanimous vote, a prosecution.
	   A side issue that has garnered some attention is the proposed
crime of ``forced pregnancies.'' Until the conference there was no
dispute on including it, but it has now come up for discussion
after heavy lobbying by the Vatican, delegates said.
	   The Vatican fears the issue could jeopardize anti-abortion laws
in some countries or imply that abortion was a right. But delegates
said the matter would not seriously jeopardize any final agreement.

Police battle Nigerian demonstrators; junta to discuss transition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. LEADS throughout to UPDATE with more rioting, raises
death toll from Wednesday to 24. ADDS situation at Abiola's house,
other details. Edits throughout. &QL; 
 &UR; By FRANK AIGBOGUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria _ Nigeria's ruling military junta mulled over
this embattled country's transition to democracy, while police
fought rioters Thursday as unrest flared anew over the death of the
country's most prominent political prisoner.
	   Fires lit in anger burned through parts of a popular central
market in Lagos; homes there and in the southern city of Abeokuta
were gutted by arsonist's fires.
	   There were no immediate reports of injuries in the fighting or
from the fires, but the bodies of at least 24 victims from violence
Wednesday have been either spotted or collected.
	   Police say the Lagos fires were set by youths enraged at the
death earlier this week of Moshood Abiola, the imprisoned
businessman who was the apparent winner of 1993's annulled
presidential elections.
	   The government says he died of a heart attack but his backers _
particularly across Nigeria's southwest where his support was the
strongest _ believe he was killed by the junta.
	   Many members of Abiola's family have also said they believed he
was killed.
	   The government says it has already completed an autopsy, but has
not yet released the results. A second independent autopsy to be
conducted by a team of visiting foreign pathologists was scheduled
for Friday.
	   On Thursday, hundreds of angry students were gathered outside
Abiola's home in the Lagos neighborhood of Ikeja, watched over by a
large detachment of riot police.
	   Abiola's son Kola angered the crowd, who accused him of siding
with the junta, after he waded through them saying ``My father was
a man of peace.''
	   Tempers were cooled after he re-emerged from the house to appeal
for calm.
	   ``This is the time for common sense so we can actualize the
ideals for which my father lived and died,'' he said.
	   The country's military junta, meanwhile, was meeting Thursday
evening to discuss plans to hand over power to civilians and
release Nigeria's remaining political prisoners.
	   They are believed to be discussing competing proposals on when
the junta should conduct fresh elections.
	   Nigeria was in the midst of a flawed transition to democracy
program when the country's former dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, died
early last month. His successor, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, has
vowed to move the country to democracy, but he has said nothing
about how it will be completed.
	   The schedule had originally called for a return to democracy by
Oct. 1, though that date seems highly improbable at this point.
	   The military's Provisional Ruling Council was also to discuss
the fate of several people convicted earlier this year of plotting
a coup against Abacha.
	   While Lagos woke up Thursday to calm streets, the situation
quickly deteriorated. Four houses were burned in Abiola's hometown
of Abeokuta, where at least ten people died in Wednesday rioting. A
dusk-to-dawn curfew did not stop demonstrators from pouring into
the streets again Thursday, where they clashed with police firing
tear gas.
	   Police say 75 people have been arrested in Abeokuta, about 70
kilometers (45 miles) north of Lagos.
	   Firefighters and police in Lagos battled a blaze that started
mid-morning in several stalls in a central market. Several houses
reportedly were also set alight by marauding groups of youths, who
police were trying to control with tear gas.
	   Brief skirmishes between police and demonstrators also broke out
in the southwestern city of Ile-Ife, where the university has been
shut down.
	   On Wednesday, Abubakar added to Nigeria's chaotic mess when he
dissolved his Cabinet. The military's ruling Provisional Ruling
Council, the core of the junta, was left untouched.
	   Abubakar, in a nationwide television address Wednesday night,
called the death of Abiola a ``national tragedy'' and appealed for
calm.
	   Abiola had been in prison since 1994, but many hoped would
emerge from jail to fulfill his 1993 electoral mandate. He died
Tuesday after suddenly falling ill during a meeting with U.S.
diplomats. He was 60.
	   A potent symbol of reform for Nigeria's poor masses, Abiola was
enormously popular in Nigeria's southwest, home of his Yoruba
ethnic group.
	   Some of the violence has been ethnic-based, with Yorubas
attacking ethnic Hausas in Lagos. Hausas and Fulanis, both from the
north, make up a majority in the military and the junta.
	   While Abiola reportedly had been very ill last year, his death
came as a surprise, just days after U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan announced that all Nigeria's political prisoners would be
freed, including Abiola.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Stone sculptures of 10 modern Christian martyrs,
including American civil rights leader Martin Luther King and
assassinated Archbishop Oscar Romero of El Salvador, took an
honored place Thursday on the medieval front of Westminster Abbey.
	   Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip joined Archbishop of
Canterbury George Carey, relatives of those honored, and state and
church representatives of many countries at an unveiling ceremony
at the abbey.
	   The 10 limestone statues, near life size, fill niches above the
Great West Door to the 900-year-old abbey church. The 20th century
martyrs are from every continent and many Christian denominations.
	   Prince Philip is a great-nephew of one of those honored _ Grand
Duchess Elizabeth of Russia, a saint of the Orthodox Church, who
was killed by the Bolsheviks in 1918.
	   Romero, the Roman Catholic archbishop of El Salvador, was
assassinated in 1980. The Franciscan Greyfriar, Maximilian Kolbe of
Poland, who is a saint of the Catholic Church, was killed by the
Nazis in 1941.
	   Anglicans honored were Manche Masemola, a 16-year-old convert in
South Africa who was killed by her animist parents in 1928; Lucian
Tapiedi, killed in 1942 during the Japanese invasion of Papua New
Guinea; and Janani Luwum, an archbishop in Uganda assassinated
during the rule of Idi Amin in 1977.
	   King, assassinated in 1969, was a Baptist preacher. Dietrich
Bonhoeffer, a German Lutheran pastor and theologian, was killed in
1945 by the Nazis; Wang Zhiming, a Chinese pastor and evangelist,
was killed in 1972 during the Cultural Revolution, and Esther John,
a Presbyterian evangelist in Pakistan, was killed in 1960.
	   The men and women were chosen, after wide consultation, to
represent major areas of persecution and oppression in the 20th
century, the abbey said.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A moderate earthquake struck a north Iranian
town Thursday, but there were no immediate reports of casualties,
Iranian officials said.
	   The quake of magnitude 5.9 shook the town of Astara on the coast
of the Caspian Sea at 6.50 p.m. local time (1420 GMT), officials at
the Natural Disasters Headquarters in Tehran said.
	   The epicenter of the quake was thought to be under the sea.
	   There were no immediate reports of damage to the town, which
lies on the border with Azerbaijan, 400 kilometers (250 miles)
north of Tehran.

Russia won't limit oil exports by tax dodgers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government can't crack down on many
tax-dodging oil companies' access to export pipelines, as it had
threatened to do, a top government official conceded Thursday.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Khristenko said the companies'
exports have already been pledged as collateral against foreign
loans.
	   That is a problem for the government's much-vaunted anti-crisis
plan, in which it aimed to plug its budget deficit with a strict
crackdown on tax deadbeats.
	   Russia's oil companies are among the budget's biggest
contributors. The government had said last month it would limit
exports of companies that had not paid their taxes.
	   ``The oil that has been committed to exports as security to
credits signed before June 15 can't be limited,'' Khristenko said
at a news conference. ``The reason is related to the defaults that
would arise at oil companies, and that could become a problem for
the federal budget.''
	   A large part of Russian crude oil production has been committed
to export through such loan deals, industry sources say.
	   Also Thursday, the government announced that it was extending
the deadline for bidding on the state-owned oil company Rosneft,
the Interfax news agency said.
	   The agency quoted Fuel and Energy Minister Sergei Generalov as
saying the deadline will probably be extended until September or
October, because ``by that time oil prices will reach an acceptable
level.''
	   The current deadline for the Rosneft tender expires July 16, but
the tender's failure looked likely because two key bidders said
they wouldn't bid.
	   An earlier tender for the stake of 75 percent plus one share in
the company failed because no one bid for it. They said the dlrs
2.1 billion starting price was too high.
	   The cash-starved federal budget desperately needs the money from
the sale. The government set the starting price at the second sale
at dlrs 1.6 billion.

U.S. government and European Union suspend aid to Sarajevo

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Leading U.S. and European
organizations have suspended money to fund aid projects for
rebuilding Sarajevo, until more minorities return to the capital,
international officials said Thursday.
	   The U.S. Agency for International Development and the European
Union have temporarily suspended up to dlrs 20 million of
reconstruction aid, until city officials follow through on
commitments to return up to 20,000 non-Muslims to their pre war
homes, said Simon Haselock, the spokesman for the top international
official in Bosnia.
	   Under pressure from international officials, Sarajevo city
authorities signed an agreement known as the ``Sarajevo
Declaration'' last March, pledging to return up to 20,000
non-Muslims to their prewar homes, now occupied by Muslims, by mid
19
	   Since the Dayton Peace Agreement was signed in 1995, only about
2,000 non-Serbs have returned to the Bosnian Serb half of the
country and 36,000 Serbs to the Muslim-Croat federation _ half of
them to Sarajevo.

Rios, Becker, Mantilla, Corretja advance to quarterfinals,
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GSTAAD, Switzerland (AP) _ Top-seed and world number-two Marcelo
Rios marched into the quarterfinals of the dlrs 560,000 Swiss Open
tennis tournament on Thursday, with a straight sets victory over
lucky loser Lucas Arnold of Argentina.
	   The Chilean, who easily won in two sets against home hero Marc
Rosset the previous day, was just as quick to dispose of Arnold,
defeating the Argentinian 6-4, 6-1.
	   Rios, who briefly took over as world number one from Pete
Sampras earlier this year, will next meet Spain's Francisco Clavet
in the quarterfinal on Friday.
	   Clavet advanced to the round of eight with a 2-6, 6-4, 6-4 win
over Gustavo Kuerten, putting an end to the Brazilian's bid for a
first title since winning the French Open last year.
	   Now ranked 119th in the world, Boris Becker proved that while he
might be semi-retired he is still a force to be reckoned with,
defeating fourth-seed Cedric Pioline 7-6 (7-2), 7-5.
	   ``I played my best match of the year,'' said Becker, the winner
of six career Grand Slam titles. ``I surprised myself. I don't
think I can play much better tennis than I did today.''
	   The 30-year-old German is hoping his first appearance at the
tournament might result in a 50th career singles title, and his
first ever on clay.
	   The defeat offered nothing but ongoing disappoinment for the
Frenchman, who, for the seventh time in as many appearances, failed
to advance past the second round of the tournament.
	   It also marked the seventh time in as many matches that the
Frenchman lost to Becker, who has not given up one set to Pioline
in the pair's last four head-to-heads.
	   Becker will have his work cut out for him in the quarterfinals,
where he will face reigning champion and fifth-seed Felix Mantilla
of Spain, who posted an up-and-down 6-4, 0-6, 6-2 victory over
France's Fabrice Santoro.
	   ``I still have a long way to go before perhaps winning my first
title on clay,'' said Becker. ``But if I serve as well as I did
today against Pioline I have a chance.''
	   In a Spanish quarterfinal showdown, third-seed Alex Corretja
will take on sixth-seed and 1996 champion Albert Costa on Friday.
	   Corretja advanced to the round of eight with a 6-0, 7-5 win over
Slava Dosedel of the Czech Republic, while Costa beat compatriot
Galo Blanco 7-6 (7-3), 6-3.
	   Eighth-seed Nicolas Kiefer of Germany secured his place in the
quarterfinals with a 6-3, 3-6, 6-1 win over Julian Alonso of Spain.
The German will take on Belgian Filip Dewulf, who posted a 3-6,
7-5, 6-3 second-round win over Fernando Meligeni of Brazil.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ France and Poland signed an agreement
Thursday on protecting military information.
	   French Defense Minister Alain Richard and his Polish counterpart
Janusz Onyszkiewicz agreed to share information and experience in
the area of air and marine armaments, communications and
modernization of tanks.
	   They also discussed restructuring of the Polish armaments
industry. The Polish ministries of defense and economy are
currently drafting a plan to consolidate and privatize the weapons
industry.
	   Richard was also scheduled to meet with President Aleksander
Kwasniewski and Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek.
	   On Wednesday, Richard observed joint exercises of French and
Polish pilots at the military airport in Minsk Mazowiecki outside
Warsaw.
	   France was the first NATO country to sign a military cooperation
with Poland in 1992, in an early step moving forward the Poles
aspirations to join the western alliance.

Mexico City borough doubles revenue by blocking corruption
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Just by forcing construction inspectors to
stop demanding bribes, a Mexico City borough has more than doubled
its revenue in only five months.
	   ``We have stopped corrupt officials from putting all that money
in their pockets,'' Jorge Legoretta, head of one of Mexico City's
16 boroughs, told reporters Wednesday.
	   Corruption in the Mexican capital has been notorious for decades
under the Institutional Revolutionary Party. The party previously
had always been led by Mexico's presidents, who had always
appointed Mexico City's mayors.
	   That changed when Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the leftist Democratic
Revolutionary Party was elected last year on a platform of
combating lawlessness.
	   It was the first time in seven decades that the city's 8.5
million people voted directly for a mayor, and Cardenas ended the
ruling party's grip on power when he took office in December.
	   Previously, inspectors went from one construction project to
another, negotiating permits and other paperwork for a price.
Often, too, they discovered or invented minor offenses, which they
also ``fixed'' for a price.
	   Legorreta fired some of the more corrupt inspectors, sent others
to training courses, and insisted that builders apply for permits
directly at the borough office.
	   As a result, Legoretta announced that revenue _ mostly from
construction permit fees, and a bit from fines _ totaled about dlrs
700,000 from January to May.
	   He said that compares to dlrs 326,000 collected by the
ruling-party administration in the borough during all of last year.

Real Madrid coach resigns after month on job
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with confirmation of resignation, comments from
outgoing coach Camacho and club chairman Sanz &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Real Madrid's coach Jose Antonio Camacho
tendered his resignation on Thursday after less than a month on the
job.
	   Camacho told reporters he was leaving the club following a
dispute over the conditions of the contract of one of his
assistants.
	   ``If I had given in on this I would have been giving in all
year'' he said on what he described as ``the saddest day of my
life.''
	   In a later press conference club chairman Lorenzo Sanz confirmed
that the former Real Madrid player's resignation as coach had been
accepted.
	   Despite lauding Camacho's qualities he said the coach had made
unreasonable demands on behalf of one of his trainers and described
the dispute as ''a matter of principle.''
	   Camacho, 43, was hired on June 17 with a two-year contract. He
took over from German Jupp Heynckes, who was fired despite having
guided the club to a record seventh European Champions title.
	   A regular on Madrid's first team between 1974 and 1989, Camacho
was the team's third coach in three seasons. As a player with
Madrid, he won six championships and two UEFA Cup trophies.
	   After retiring as a player in 1989, Camacho coached the
first-division teams Espanyol and Sevilla.

Mubarak defies U.N. embargo to fly to Libya
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS in para 5 details on permission for Mubarak's trip.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak flew to
Libya on Thursday to see Col. Moammar Gadhafi on a trip for which
he had permission to override a U.N. air embargo.
	   Mubarak was accompanied by several ministers, aides and a
medical team on the flight, which Egyptian officials said was to
check on Gadhafi's health.
	   Libyan state-run television showed Mubarak greeting Gadhafi who
sat in a wheel chair. Gadhafi had an operation Monday on his hip
which he broke while exercising.
	   It was the first time the U.N. sanctions committee had given
approval for such a flight _ waivers are generally made for
humanitarian purposes only, U.N. officials said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   Egypt requested and got approval Wednesday afternoon from the
U.N. sanctions committee for the flight, said U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard. Chad and Niger, however, did not request and did not have
such approval.
	   The United Nations took note of the fact that Mubarak would be
visiting Gadhafi with a medical team, U.N. officials said.
	   The air embargo was imposed in 1992 after Gadhafi refused to
hand over two Libyans suspected in the 1988 bombing of an American
airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland that killed 270 people.
	   Mubarak flew from Cairo to Al-Abrak town, 60 kilometers (37
miles) from the northern seaside town of Al-Bayda, Libyan
television said in a broadcast monitored in Cairo.
	   ``President Hosni Mubarak arrived aboard an Egyptian plane at
Al-Abrak civilian airport,'' a commentator on Libyan television
said in a live broadcast from Al-Abrak where Libyan officials gave
Mubarak a red carpet welcome.
	   Mubarak's visit was not announced and Egypt's official Middle
East News Agency only reported his arrival in Libya at about the
same time Libyan television started its live broadcast.
	   From Al-Abrak, Mubarak drove to Al-Bayda where he met with
Gadhafi. Al-Bayda is 1,400 kilometers (865 miles) east of Tripoli,
the Libyan capital.
	   The state Libyan television showed Mubarak shaking hands with
Gadhafi and kissing him on both cheeks.
	   The Egyptian agency reported Mubarak's return early Thursday
evening, saying he had gone to Libya ``to be reassured of the
health of brother Moammar Gadhafi.''
	   The agency said nothing about how Mubarak traveled to Libya nor
that he had received permission from the United Nations.
	   Gadhafi, 56, is recovering well from his operation and resumed
normal work on Wednesday, the Libyan official news agency JANA
said. Footage of the operation was broadcast by Libyan television
on Tuesday.
	   During their meeting, Gadhafi's doctors showed Mubarak three
X-rays of the broken hip.
	   Mubarak has visited Libya many times since 1992 but has always
driven across the Egyptian-Libyan border.
	   Last month, the Organization of African Unity urged member
states to ignore the sanctions for visits with humanitarian and
religious implications or those relating to official OAU work.
	   So far only Chad and Niger have heeded the call. Their
presidents flew to Libya earlier this week.
	   U.N. officials said Thursday the Chad and Niger governments
neither requested nor received permission to fly to Libya.
	   Gadhafi twice canceled a visit to Egypt last month, apparently
angered by Egypt's refusal to let him fly to Cairo.
	   Libya recently launched a campaign to win wider support from the
22-nation Arab League to lift the U.N. embargo. In September 1997,
the League had urged member states to ``take steps to ease the
toughness of the sanctions.''

Ethiopian minister: Russia should maintain Soviet interest in
</HEADLINE>
Africa &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin concluded
a visit to Moscow on Thursday by urging Russia to maintain the
Soviet Union's strong role in Africa, a news agency said.
	   ``Just as the former Soviet Union backed the struggle of African
peoples against colonialism, Russia today also expresses solidarity
with their struggle against poverty and backwardness,'' Mesfin told
the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   ``Russia has a broad arsenal of means for supporting African
states. Realizing this, we urge Moscow to continue to develop a
reasonable, comprehensive and mutually advantageous partnership
with Africa.''
	   Despite Mefsin's statement, Russia is not capable of maintaining
anything like the material and financial support the Soviet Union
lavished on some African countries.
	   Mesfin said one potentially sore subject _ old debts to Russia _
did not come up in his talks with Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov.
	   ``I am convinced that we will settle all issues in a friendly
way, in the interests of both Russia and Ethiopia,'' he said.

Red Cross brings together Serb family after members abducted
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The International Red Cross reunited
a Serb family Thursday, after negotiating the release of the father
and son who had been abducted by Albanian militants fighting for
independence of Kosovo.
	   Vojko Bakrac, 45, and son Ivan, 18 were seized by armed men
wearing uniforms of the Kosovo Liberation Army while riding a bus
to Pristina 10 days ago. Bakrac and his family were bound for the
Yugoslav capital Belgrade to obtain papers for emigration to
Canada.
	   The two were released to the ICRC Monday, after the organization
helped Vesna Bakrac, who had witnessed the kidnapping, appeal
through local media for her husband and son to be freed, said
Thomas Markelbach, an ICRC spokesman in Belgrade.
	   On Thursday, ICRC brought the three Bakracs to Belgrade to be
reunited with the family's other son. The family was living in
Kosovo's southwestern town of Djakovica, after they were forced to
abandon their homes in Croatia during wars there in the early
1990s.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and dozens of other abducted
since Serb security forces launched a crackdown on ethnic Albanian
militants fighting for Kosovo's independence. Kosovo is a province
of Serbia, which along with Montenegro forms Yugoslavia.
	   In the a report released Thursday, the ICRC called on all those
who hold civilians to give them access to the abducted persons.
Dozens of families remain without news of their loved ones who have
been abducted or gone missing.

Holocaust survivors appalled by publication of rightist party's
</HEADLINE>
membership list &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout, edits to tighten, ADDS byline. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Holocaust survivors angrily
criticized a Jewish magazine's decision to publish names from a
right-wing party's membership list, saying Thursday it reminds them
of Nazi-era attacks on privacy and other freedoms.
	   Marika Weinberger, a survivor of the Auschwitz death camp and
president of the Australian Jewish Holocaust Survivors, said she
was very distressed by the publication.
	   ``The countries we have come from, those of us who survived,
came to Australia because privacy was something we cherished and
didn't have,'' Weinberger said.
	   ``We know the implications of what happens when lists, any
lists, are published and handed over to people.''
	   The decision by The Australia-Israel Review, a private
pro-Israeli magazine, to publish the list of 2,000 members of the
right-wing One Nation party has split the 100,000-strong Jewish
community.
	   Publisher Mark Leibler defended the decision, but said no more
names would be published, as had been promised. He said the list
was given to the magazine by senior members of One Nation who were
unhappy with party leaders.
	   The right-wing party condemned the publication of the list.
	   ``That in particular it would be members of the Jewish community
that would perpetrate such a crime as publishing a private
membership list would seem almost without explanation,'' said party
spokesman David Oldfield.
	   But many in the Jewish community supported the magazine's
decision.
	   ``I don't believe that the people whose names have been
published are likely to be targeted, anyway, and the only thing
they are likely to suffer is embarrassment,'' said Peter Wertheim,
acting president of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, a
leading Jewish group.
	   Others said the publication was undemocratic and could cause a
backlash against the Jewish community.
	   Vic Alhadeff, editor of the Australian Jewish News, the
country's largest Jewish newspaper, said many were concerned about
media coverage stemming from the incident. The Sydney tabloid Daily
Telegraph ran a front page photo of neo-Nazis giving the Heil
Hitler salute.
	   ``There has been an unfortunate reaction in drawing comparisons
with Nazis. Obviously the circumstances are hugely different and
it's also drawn extremists out of the woodwork,'' Alhadeff said.
	   He said the Australia-Israel Review has a very small circulation
and doesn't represent the sentiments of the entire Jewish
community.
	   The controversy comes amid the reemergence of race issues onto
the Australian political and social agenda.
	   One Nation, led by independent federal legislator Pauline
Hanson, sent shockwaves through Australian politics by securing
more than 20 percent of the vote at a June 13 Queensland election,
the party's first electoral test since its creation less than 18
months ago. National opinion polls put One Nation support in the
low- to mid-teens.
	   Hanson claims Australia is becoming ``Asianized'' and has called
for immigration to be cut and welfare benefits specifically
targeting Aborigines to be abolished.

Red Cross brings together Serb family after members abducted
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The International Red Cross reunited
a Serb family Thursday, after negotiating the release of the father
and son who had been abducted by Albanian militants fighting for
independence of Kosovo.
	   Vojko Bakrac, 45, and son Ivan, 18 were seized by armed men
wearing uniforms of the Kosovo Liberation Army while riding a bus
to Pristina 10 days ago. Bakrac and his family were bound for the
Yugoslav capital Belgrade to obtain papers for emigration to
Canada.
	   The two were released to the ICRC Monday, after the organization
helped Vesna Bakrac, who had witnessed the kidnapping, appeal
through local media for her husband and son to be freed, said
Thomas Markelbach, an ICRC spokesman in Belgrade.
	   On Thursday, ICRC brought the three Bakracs to Belgrade to be
reunited with the family's other son. The family was living in
Kosovo's southwestern town of Djakovica, after they were forced to
abandon their homes in Croatia during wars there in the early
1990s.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and dozens of other abducted
since Serb security forces launched a crackdown on ethnic Albanian
militants fighting for Kosovo's independence. Kosovo is a province
of Serbia, which along with Montenegro forms Yugoslavia.
	   In the report released Thursday, the ICRC called on all those
who hold civilians to give them access to the abducted persons.
Dozens of families remain without news of their loved ones who have

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GSTAAD, Switzerland (AP) _ Top-seed and world number-two Marcelo
Rios marched into the quarterfinals of the dlrs 560,000 Swiss Open
tennis tournament on Thursday, with a straight sets victory over
lucky loser Lucas Arnold of Argentina.
	   The Chilean, who easily won in two sets against home hero Marc
Rosset the previous day, was just as quick to dispose of Arnold,
defeating the Argentinian 6-4, 6-1.
	   Rios, who briefly took over as world number one from Pete
Sampras earlier this year, will next meet Spain's Francisco Clavet
in the quarterfinal on Friday.
	   Clavet advanced to the round of eight with a 2-6, 6-4, 6-4 win
over Gustavo Kuerten, putting an end to the Brazilian's bid for a
first title since winning the French Open last year.
	   Now ranked 119th in the world, Boris Becker proved that while he
might be semi-retired he is still a force to be reckoned with,
defeating fourth-seed Cedric Pioline 7-6 (7-2), 7-5.
	   ``I played my best match of the year,'' said Becker, the winner
of six career Grand Slam titles. ``I surprised myself. I don't
think I can play much better tennis than I did today.''
	   The 30-year-old German is hoping his first appearance at the
tournament might result in a 50th career singles title, and his
first ever on clay.
	   The defeat offered nothing but ongoing disappoinment for the
Frenchman, who, for the seventh time in as many appearances, failed
to advance past the second round of the tournament.
	   It also marked the seventh time in as many matches that the
Frenchman lost to Becker, who has not given up one set to Pioline
in the pair's last four head-to-heads.
	   Becker will have his work cut out for him in the quarterfinals,
where he will face reigning champion and fifth-seed Felix Mantilla
of Spain, who posted an up-and-down 6-4, 0-6, 6-2 victory over
France's Fabrice Santoro.
	   ``I still have a long way to go before perhaps winning my first
title on clay,'' said Becker. ``But if I serve as well as I did
today against Pioline I have a chance.''
	   In a Spanish quarterfinal showdown, third-seed Alex Corretja
will take on sixth-seed and 1996 champion Albert Costa on Friday.
	   Corretja advanced to the round of eight with a 6-0, 7-5 win over
Slava Dosedel of the Czech Republic, while Costa beat compatriot
Galo Blanco 7-6 (7-3), 6-3.
	   Eighth-seed Nicolas Kiefer of Germany secured his place in the
quarterfinals with a 6-3, 3-6, 6-1 win over Julian Alonso of Spain.
The German will take on Belgian Filip Dewulf, who posted a 3-6,
7-5, 6-3 second-round win over Fernando Meligeni of Brazil.

	   JUNIK, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo's ethnic Albanian rebels held
their ground Thursday near the border with Albania after two days
of attacks by Serb security forces. International observers took
advantage of the lull in fighting to tour flash points in the
province.
	   In Vienna, Austria, the Organization of Security and Cooperation
in Europe said Yugoslavia had agreed to let an OSCE delegation
visit the country, including Kosovo, for about 10 days as part of
international efforts to end the conflict.
	   Yugoslavia has refused to accept OSCE mediation until its
membership in the 54-member organization is restored. Although the
Yugoslav agreement falls short of accepting OSCE mediation, U.S.
and European officials called the invitation a step in the right
direction.
	   The United States and the Europeans are trying to prevent
Kosovo's fighting from spreading to other Balkan countries with
substantial Albanian communities.
	   But those countries oppose independence for Kosovo _ a province
of Serbia, which is one of two republics in Yugoslavia. Both
Kosovo's Albanian moderate politicians and the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army insist on independence for the province, whose
population is overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian.
	   Albanian sources reported scattered shelling by Serbs on
Thursday near the southwestern Kosovo town of Djakovica. There were
no reports of casualties and no confirmation by government sources.
	   Outside the border town of Junik, 20 kilometers (12 miles) north
of Djakovica, a local KLA officer, Gani Shehu, said two of his
fighters were wounded during two days of Serb attacks.
	   Shehu said casualties were apparently much higher in the nearby
town of Morina, which also came under Serb mortar, artillery and
infantry attacks Tuesday and Wednesday. Shehu said communications
to the area had been cut.
	   It appeared the Serbs were trying to seal off KLA supply lines
to nearby Albania, the rebels' major source of weapons and
ammunition.
	   About a dozen diplomats and military personnel from the United
States, Russia, the Netherlands, Belgium and Britain toured parts
of western Kosovo on Thursday as part of what U.S. officials say
will be a series of visits throughout the province.
	   The visits are designed in part to reassure both Albanian and
Serb civilians that the world has not abandoned them. The visits
are also aimed at gathering firsthand information about the
conflict, which has killed hundreds since late February.
	   The United States and European countries have demanded an
immediate cease-fire and have threatened to crack down on the flow
of funds to the KLA from Albanian communities abroad.
	   Those countries want the rebels to accept moderate ethnic
Albanian politician Ibrahim Rugova as the leader in future talks
with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on the future of the
province.
	   Rugova also supports independence but has rejected violence.
That has so far made him unacceptable to the guerrillas.
	   ``For nine years, Rugova has been calling for dialogue,'' Naim
Maloku, a top KLA commander in western Kosovo, said in an interview
published Thursday by the Albanian language daily Koha Ditore.
``The war has been imposed on us. We had no other way out.''
	   In neighboring Albania, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
repeated calls for Kosovo's Albanians to accept Rugova and end the
violence. Kinkel warned the rebels that ``the secession of Kosovo
will not be supported by the international community.''
	   He said the Europeans were studying ways to help stop the flow
of arms into Kosovo and told the Albanian government that it ``has
a special responsibility'' to halt the violence.

Police battle Nigerian demonstrators; junta to discuss transition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more rioting, raises death toll from Wednesday to

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria _ Nigeria's ruling military junta debated this
embattled country's transition to democracy, while police fought
rioters Thursday as unrest flared anew over the death of the
country's most prominent political prisoner.
	   Fires lit in anger burned through parts of a popular central
market in Lagos; homes there and in the southern city of Abeokuta
were gutted by arsonist's fires.
	   There were no immediate reports of injuries in the fighting or
from the fires, but the bodies of at least 24 victims from violence
Wednesday have been either spotted or collected.
	   Police say the Lagos fires were set by youths enraged at the
death earlier this week of Moshood Abiola, the imprisoned
businessman who was the apparent winner of 1993's annulled
presidential elections.
	   The government says he died of a heart attack but his backers _
particularly across Nigeria's southwest where his support was the
strongest _ believe he was killed by the junta.
	   Many members of Abiola's family have also said they believed he
was killed.
	   The government says it has already completed an autopsy, but has
not yet released the results. A second independent autopsy to be
conducted by a team of visiting foreign pathologists was scheduled
for Friday.
	   On Thursday, hundreds of angry students were gathered outside
Abiola's home in the Lagos neighborhood of Ikeja, watched over by a
large detachment of riot police.
	   Abiola's son Kola angered the crowd, who accused him of siding
with the junta, after he waded through them saying ``My father was
a man of peace.''
	   Tempers were cooled after he re-emerged from the house to appeal
for calm.
	   ``This is the time for common sense so we can actualize the
ideals for which my father lived and died,'' he said.
	   The country's military junta, meanwhile, was meeting Thursday
evening to discuss plans to hand over power to civilians and
release Nigeria's remaining political prisoners.
	   They are believed to be discussing competing proposals on when
the junta should conduct fresh elections.
	   Nigeria was in the midst of a flawed transition to democracy
program when the country's former dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, died
early last month. His successor, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, has
vowed to move the country to democracy, but he has said nothing
about how it will be completed.
	   The schedule had originally called for a return to democracy by
Oct. 1, though that date seems highly improbable at this point.
	   The military's Provisional Ruling Council was also to discuss
the fate of several people convicted earlier this year of plotting
a coup against Abacha.
	   While Lagos woke up Thursday to calm streets, the situation
quickly deteriorated. Four houses were burned in Abiola's hometown
of Abeokuta, where at least ten people died in Wednesday rioting. A
dusk-to-dawn curfew did not stop demonstrators from pouring into
the streets again Thursday, where they clashed with police firing
tear gas.
	   Police say 75 people have been arrested in Abeokuta, about 70
kilometers (45 miles) north of Lagos.
	   Firefighters and police in Lagos battled a blaze that started
mid-morning in several stalls in a central market. Several houses
reportedly were also set alight by marauding groups of youths, who
police were trying to control with tear gas.
	   Brief skirmishes between police and demonstrators also broke out
in the southwestern city of Ile-Ife, where the university has been
shut down.
	   On Wednesday, Abubakar added to Nigeria's chaotic mess when he
dissolved his Cabinet. The military's ruling Provisional Ruling
Council, the core of the junta, was left untouched.
	   Abubakar, in a nationwide television address Wednesday night,
called the death of Abiola a ``national tragedy'' and appealed for
calm.
	   Abiola had been in prison since 1994, but many hoped would
emerge from jail to fulfill his 1993 electoral mandate. He died
Tuesday after suddenly falling ill during a meeting with U.S.
diplomats. He was 60.
	   A potent symbol of reform for Nigeria's poor masses, Abiola was
enormously popular in Nigeria's southwest, home of his Yoruba
ethnic group.
	   Some of the violence has been ethnic-based, with Yorubas
attacking ethnic Hausas in Lagos. Hausas and Fulanis, both from the
north, make up a majority in the military and the junta.
	   While Abiola reportedly had been very ill last year, his death
came as a surprise, just days after U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan announced that all Nigeria's political prisoners would be
freed, including Abiola.

Defense makes final arguments in extradition hearing

 &UR; Eds: AMs RECAST. UPDATES with fresh quotes; details &QL; 
 &UR; By DANNA HARMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A teary-eyed Victoria Sheinbein stuffed half a
dozen chocolate chip granola bars into the chained hands of her son
Samuel Thursday, as she said goodbye to the 17-year-old who is
fighting extradition to Maryland.
	   Mrs. Sheinbein flew in from the United States to attend the
final day of extradition hearings in an Israeli court. The judge
promised to rule by Sept. 1 on whether Sheinbein should be returned
to the United States to stand trial in the brutal killing of a
19-year-old acquaintance.
	   In his six hour summation Thursday, Sheinbein's attorney, David
Libai, wrapped up months of testimony with a detailed account of
the Sheinbein family's connection to Israel, in an attempt to prove
his client's entitlement to Israeli citizenship.
	   Sheinbein fled to Israel after the Sept. 19, 1997 killing of
Alfred Tello Jr. and is claiming Israeli citizenship in an attempt
to prevent his extradition. Israeli law bars citizens from being
sent abroad to stand trial.
	   In the closed-door hearing at Jerusalem's magistrate court,
Libai argued that Sol Sheinbein, Samuel's father, is and always was
an Israeli citizen, and that the status is automatically passed on
to the younger Sheinbein.
	   ``We stand here against extradition not because we want to avoid
justice,'' said Libai according to the court transcript. ``We want
the defendant to be tried, and, if he deserves it, to be punished.
But to extradite him would be illegal.''
	   Libai told the court that to extradite Sheinbein would be ``a
dangerous precedent,'' and would be seen as a submission to U.S.
political pressure. The Maryland prosecution team, who was
listening to a translation of the arguments on a conference call,
did not respond.
	   State prosecutor Irit Kaan, however, said that allowing
Sheinbein to take refuge in Israel would be a ``cynical
exploitation'' of Israel's citizenship laws. She argued that
Sheinbein's father lost his citizenship because he moved his family
to the United States in 1950, two years after the state was
founded, and before the country's citizenship law went into effect.
	   Throughout the session, Sheinbein sat quietly, handcuffed and
shackled. Asked repeatedly by reporters during recesses if he
wanted to say anything, he replied, ``no, not now, not ever.'' His
parents, who both sat near him and patted him on the back, also
declined comment.
	   Sheinbein never lived in Israel and never held an Israeli
passport. If he were to be tried and convicted in Israel, his
sentence would most likely be lighter then if he were to be
convicted in the United States. Another teen-ager charged in the
murder, 18-year-old Aaron Needle, hanged himself in his Maryland
cell in April.
	   At the end of the day's hearings, Mrs. Sheinbein slipped out of
the courtroom and stood crying in the corridor. When she returned,
Sheinbein reached out to hold her hand. She emptied a box of
granola bars into his handcuffed hands for him to take back to
detention. ``Come on,'' she insisted, ``you need strength.''

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Real Madrid's coach Jose Antonio Camacho
tendered his resignation on Thursday after less than a month on the
job.
	   Camacho told reporters he was leaving the club following a
dispute over the conditions of the contract of one of his
assistants.
	   ``If I had given in on this I would have been giving in all
year'' he said on what he described as ``the saddest day of my
life.''
	   In a later press conference club chairman Lorenzo Sanz confirmed
that the former Real Madrid player's resignation as coach had been
accepted.
	   Despite lauding Camacho's qualities he said the coach had made
unreasonable demands on behalf of one of his trainers and described
the dispute as ``a matter of principle.''
	   Real Madrid was immediately reported to be chasing Dutch World
Cup coach Guus Hiddink to replace Camacho, but Sanz said it was
''far too early to name a replacement,'' despite the fast
approaching new season.
	   Camacho, 43, was hired on June 17 with a two-year contract. He
took over from German Jupp Heynckes, who was fired despite having
guided the club to a record seventh European Champions title.
	   A regular on Madrid's first team between 1974 and 1989, Camacho
was the team's third coach in three seasons. As a player with
Madrid, he won six championships and two UEFA Cup trophies.
	   After retiring as a player in 1989, Camacho coached the
first-division teams Espanyol and Sevilla.

Defense makes final arguments in extradition hearing

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A teary-eyed Victoria Sheinbein stuffed half a
dozen chocolate chip granola bars into the chained hands of her son
Samuel Thursday, as she said goodbye to the 17-year-old who is
fighting extradition to Maryland.
	   Mrs. Sheinbein flew in from the United States to attend the
final day of extradition hearings in an Israeli court. The judge
promised to rule by Sept. 1 on whether Sheinbein should be returned
to the United States to stand trial in the brutal killing of a
19-year-old acquaintance.
	   In his six hour summation Thursday, Sheinbein's attorney, David
Libai, wrapped up months of testimony with a detailed account of
the Sheinbein family's connection to Israel, in an attempt to prove
his client's entitlement to Israeli citizenship.
	   Sheinbein fled to Israel after the Sept. 19, 1997 killing of
Alfred Tello Jr. and is claiming Israeli citizenship in an attempt
to prevent his extradition. Israeli law bars citizens from being
sent abroad to stand trial.
	   In the closed-door hearing at Jerusalem's magistrate court,
Libai argued that Sol Sheinbein, Samuel's father, is and always was
an Israeli citizen, and that the status is automatically passed on
to the younger Sheinbein.
	   ``We stand here against extradition not because we want to avoid
justice,'' said Libai according to the court transcript. ``We want
the defendant to be tried, and, if he deserves it, to be punished.
But to extradite him would be illegal.''
	   Libai told the court that to extradite Sheinbein would be ``a
dangerous precedent,'' and would be seen as a submission to U.S.
political pressure. The Maryland prosecution team, who was
listening to a translation of the arguments on a conference call,
did not respond.
	   State prosecutor Irit Kaan, however, said that allowing
Sheinbein to take refuge in Israel would be a ``cynical
exploitation'' of Israel's citizenship laws. She argued that
Sheinbein's father lost his citizenship because he moved his family
to the United States in 1950, two years after the state was
founded, and before the country's citizenship law went into effect.
	   Throughout the session, Sheinbein sat quietly, handcuffed and
shackled. Asked repeatedly by reporters during recesses if he
wanted to say anything, he replied, ``no, not now, not ever.'' His
parents, who both sat near him and patted him on the back, also
declined comment.
	   Sheinbein never lived in Israel and never held an Israeli
passport. If he were to be tried and convicted in Israel, his
sentence would most likely be lighter then if he were to be
convicted in the United States. Another teen-ager charged in the
murder, 18-year-old Aaron Needle, hanged himself in his Maryland
cell in April.
	   At the end of the day's hearings, Mrs. Sheinbein slipped out of
the courtroom and stood crying in the corridor. When she returned,
Sheinbein reached out to hold her hand. She emptied a box of
granola bars into his handcuffed hands for him to take back to
detention. ``Come on,'' she insisted, ``you need strength.''

No hint of compromise emerges from Orange meeting with Blair
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: AMs; UPDATES throughout
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Protestant marchers, Catholic
protesters, the soldiers and police between them, and the British
government which ordered the march halted, all stubbornly held
their ground Thursday after a fourth night of violence in Northern
Ireland.
	   In London, Prime Minister Tony Blair told a delegation of Orange
Order leaders that he would not reverse the Northern Ireland
Parades Commission's decision blocking the Protestant brotherhood
from marching down the Garvaghy Road and through a hostile Catholic
neighborhood in Portadown, 25 miles (40 kms) southwest of Belfast.
	   One Orange leader threatened that Protestants could ``paralyze''
Northern Ireland unless its march goes through. While others were
more conciliatory, Orangemen still refused to talk directly to
their Catholic opponents as the volatile 12th of July holiday draws
closer.
	   Portadown Orangemen and their supporters have been camped out in
fields around the rural Drumcree Anglican church since police and
British soldiers stopped the contentious march on Sunday. Every
night since then, hard-line Protestants across Northern Ireland
have vented their wrath by blocking roads, setting fire to stolen
cars and trucks and, in some cases, shooting at police and
soldiers.
	   The province's Housing Executive said that it was dealing with
52 cases of people who had been forced out of their homes by
bombings and other intimidation.
	   Beween Sunday and 6 a.m. Thursday, police said there had been
501 attacks on police and soldiers, including 14 cases of gunfire;
125 arrests; 509 gasoline bomb attacks; 1,687 gasoline bombs
seized, 154 vehicles stolen; 86 attacks on homes and 14 attacks on
other buildings; 317 attacks on cars and 50 injuries to police
offices.
	   Neither the marchers nor the Catholics of the Garvaghy Road have
given an inch.
	   ``I believe that the real solution to this problem is to
recognize freedom of movement, freedom of assembly and allow
Portadown District to return along their traditional route home,''
said the Orange Order's executive officer, George Patton, who was
part of a group that went to London on Thursday.
	   To the Catholic protesters, the situation boils down to the
slogan: ``No talk, no walk.'' They demand that the Orange Order
meet with local residents, led by former Irish Republican Army
prisoner Breandan MacCionnaith.
	   Martin McGuinness, a leader of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party,
met with Garvaghy Road residents Thursday and said it was ``time
for the Orange Order ... to wake up.''
	   ``The reality is that the people that we represent are no longer
going to be second-class citizens in their own country,''
McGuinness said.
	   David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionist Party and the newly
elected First Minister of Northern Ireland's new Assembly, said his
emissary had met MacCionnaith last week and met ``total obduracy.''
	   ``We all realize that the situation could come to a boil over
the weekend. We don't want to see that happening. I hope that
people will still find a way of arriving at an accommodation over
the time that is available,'' Trimble said.
	   The 12th of July is the big day on the Protestant calendar, as
hundreds of Orange Order marches commemorate the victory of the
Protestant monarch William of Orange over the Catholic King James
II at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. Because the 12th falls on a
Sunday, the marches will be held on Monday this year.

Swiss diplomat accuses New York finance chief of `intimidation
</HEADLINE>
tactics' &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ The Swiss diplomat heading the
country's task force on its wartime past Thursday accused New York
City's finance chief of ``manipulations'' and ``intimidation
tactics'' in the controversy over Holocaust assets.
	   New York City Comptroller Alan Hevesi was ``in clear
contradiction with the facts'' to claim the Swiss government had
broken a promise to take part in a settlement, said Thomas Borer.
	   In a strongly worded letter to Hevesi, Borer rejected Hevesi's
assertion last week that the Swiss government was ``misleading
millions of Swiss.''
	   Borer denied that the Swiss government had ever agreed to take
part in negotiations.
	   ``Such manipulations typify the way the way Switzerland has been
treated by some quarters since the beginning of the controversy,''
Borer said.
	   Hevesi said a commission he chairs advising hundreds of city and
state finance officials had decided to recommend sanctions after a
Swiss government representative said Switzerland ``will never,
ever'' participate in negotiating a settlement of Holocaust
survivors' claims against Swiss banks.
	   ``Intimidation tactics like this can only recall the most
flagrant propaganda methods,'' Borer said. ``They will certainly
not help resolve this most important issue.''
	   Borer pointed to a survey published Sunday which showed 70
percent of Swiss in favor of concerted diplomatic moves against any
sanctions and 61 percent for a protest to the World Trade
Organization.
	   He regretted a turn of events ``which cannot in any way be in
the interest of the Holocaust survivors.''
	   Switzerland's three biggest banks made what they said was their
final offer of dlrs 600 million last month. Jewish leaders said
they should be paying more than dlrs 1 billion.
	   Hevesi and State Comptroller H. Carl McCall announced plans to
bar investments with Swiss banks from Sept. 1 if no settlement is
reached. Other states have also announced sanctions plans.

German chancellor's main challenger takes credit for economic
</HEADLINE>
upswing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MAINZ, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl's main challenger
in September national elections said Thursday any upswing going on
now in the German economy is attributable to him because the
country is expecting a change in government.
	   The comments, in an interview with Mainz-based national ZDF
television, brought an immediate outcry from Kohl's
conservative-centrist coalition, with government spokesman Otto
Hauser calling it ``the hour of fairy tales.''
	   With the election less than three months away on Sept. 27, Kohl
who is behind in the polls, has been campaigning heavily on a drop
in unemployment saying the economy is picking up.
	   But Social Democratic candidate Gerhard Schroeder told ZDF ``the
improvement that we now have is my improvement.'' Hopes for a
better economic situation were pinned on ``hopes for a change of
government,'' he said.
	   The federal labor office in Nuremberg has attributed part of the
economic improvement on Kohl's government funding public work
projects putting more people back on the job just before the
election.
	   But many economists say the drop in joblessness to 10.5 percent
in June from l0.9 percent in May is a real indication the economy
is picking up.
	   Kohl's Christian Democratic party General Secretary, Peter
Hintze, called Schroeder's claim ``the summit of shamelessness.''
	   Labor Minister Norbert Bluem said Schroeder was ``mistaking
himself for God. Through awaiting his coming the world has already
improved.''
	   Schroeder has said he wants major tax reforms and is for
imposing a minimum 20 percent tax on wealthy individuals who are
experts at using Germany's tax law loopholes to avoid paying at
all.
	   Kohl's coalition blames Schroeder's leftist Social Democrats for
blocking a major tax reform bill that was aimed at boosting the
economy for more than a year, and now using that idea for their own
political purposes.
	   Latest polls show Schroeder's party leading Kohl's coalition 43
to 36 percentage points, and the challenger has said he can foresee
governing with the environmentalist Greens if they get the minimum
5 percent of the vote needed to return to parliament. Polls have
them running at about that level.
	   But Schroeder rejected recent Greens calls for reducing speed
limits on Germany's super highways, saying he's satisfied with the
law as it now is.

Mubarak flies to Libya with U.N. permission
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from Mubarak grafs 7-8; minor edits to
grafs 11-17; no pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak flew to
Libya Thursday to see Col. Moammar Gadhafi on a trip for which he
had permission to override a U.N. air embargo.
	   Mubarak was accompanied by several ministers, aides and a
medical team on the flight, which Egypt billed as intended to check
on the health of Gadhafi.
	   Libyan state-run television showed Mubarak greeting Gadhafi who
sat in a wheel chair. Gadhafi had an operation Monday on his hip
which he broke while exercising.
	   It was the first time the U.N. sanctions committee had given
approval for such a flight _ waivers are generally made for
humanitarian purposes only, U.N. officials said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   The United Nations took note of the fact that Mubarak would be
visiting Gadhafi with a medical team, U.N. officials said.
	   The air embargo was imposed in 1992 after Gadhafi refused to
hand over two Libyans suspected in the 1988 bombing of an American
airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland that killed 270 people.
	   ``We (Arabs) are one nation and these borders are illusionary.
Libyans come to visit us and Egyptians visit Libya,'' Mubarak told
reporters with Gadhafi sitting beside him.
	   ``We are happy that (Gadhafi's injury) was only an accident,
otherwise we would have rumors and different stories here and
there,'' Mubarak said in reference to the numerous reports of
attempts to assassinate the Libyan leader.
	   Mubarak flew from Cairo to Al-Abrak town, 60 kilometers (37
miles) from the northern seaside town of Al-Bayda, Libyan
television said in a broadcast monitored in Cairo.
	   ``President Hosni Mubarak arrived aboard an Egyptian plane at
Al-Abrak civilian airport,'' a commentator on Libyan television
said in a live broadcast from Al-Abrak where Libyan officials gave
Mubarak a red carpet welcome.
	   From Al-Abrak, Mubarak drove to Al-Bayda where he met with
Gadhafi. Al-Bayda is 1,400 kilometers (865 miles) east of Tripoli,
the Libyan capital.
	   Libyan television showed Mubarak shaking hands with Gadhafi,
kissing him on both cheeks, and looking at X-rays of the broken
hip.
	   Mubarak's visit was not announced. Egypt's official Middle East
News Agency only reported his arrival in Libya at about the time
Libyan television started its broadcast.
	   The agency reported Mubarak's return early Thursday evening,
saying he had gone to Libya ``to be reassured of the health of
brother Moammar Gadhafi.''
	   The report said nothing about how Mubarak traveled to Libya nor
that he had received permission from the United Nations. Only late
Thursday did the agency report from New York that the world body
had authorized the flight to Libya.
	   Gadhafi, 56, is recovering well from his operation and resumed
normal work on Wednesday, the Libyan official news agency JANA
said. Footage of the operation was broadcast by Libyan television
on Tuesday.
	   Mubarak has visited Libya many times since 1992 but always used
to drive across the Egyptian-Libyan border.
	   Last month, the Organization of African Unity urged member
states to ignore the sanctions for visits with humanitarian and
religious implications or those relating to official OAU work.
	   So far only Chad and Niger have heeded the call. Their
presidents flew to Libya earlier this week.
	   U.N. officials said Thursday the Chad and Niger governments
neither requested nor received permission to fly to Libya.
	   Gadhafi twice canceled a visit to Egypt last month, apparently
angered by Egypt's refusal to let him fly to Cairo.
	   Libya recently launched a campaign to win wider support from the
22-nation Arab League to lift the U.N. embargo. In September 1997,
the League had urged member states to ``take steps to ease the
toughness of the sanctions.''

UN ready to OK Sierra Leone observer mission
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Security Council members have agreed to
establish a U.N. observer mission for Sierra Leone to help disarm
the former ruling junta and support civilian rule in the West
African country.
	   A resolution that would authorize the 70-member team could be
approved Monday, said council President Sergey Lavrov of Russia.
All the permanent council members were in favor, said council
sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan had recommended such a team be
sent to Sierra Leone to ``lend much-needed impetus to a fragile but
vital process.''
	   Nigerian-led West African peacekeepers ousted the military junta
of Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma in February and restored the elected
government of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
	   Koroma toppled Kabbah in a coup in May of last year.
	   The U.N. team's mission would be to help the Nigerian-led force
demobilize junta members and their allies who are still hiding out
in remote parts of the countryside.
	   A draft of the resolution ``condemns the continued reistance of
remnants of the ousted junta and members of the Revolutionary
United Front to the authority of the legitimate government and the
violence they are perpetrating against the civilian population of
Sierra Leone and demands they lay down their arms immediately.''
	   The team would have an initial six-month mandate, through Jan.
13, and would be accompanied by a medical unit and military
observers.
	   The resolution also said it welcomed efforts by the Sierra Leone
government to respond to the needs of children affected by the
fighting. The notation comes after the Security Council debated the
issue of child soldiers last month and pledged to pay close
attention to the plight of children whenever they deal with the
role of the United Nations in conflict zones.
	   The Security Council last month lifted an arms embargo on Sierra
Leone, the last remaining sanction from a series of penalties
imposed in October.
	   But the council ordered all U.N. member states to ensure that
weapons shipments to Sierra Leone pass exclusively through areas
under the control of the civilian government and its Nigerian
allies.
	   Member states have also been asked to prevent senior junta
figures and their families from entering their territory.

Gucci slay defendant implicates millionaire's ex-wife
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ The man who hired the killer of Maurizio
Gucci and drove the getaway car testified Thursday he could prove
the former fashion mogul's ex-wife was behind the slaying.
	   The testimony by former pizzeria operator Orazio Cicala was a
blow to the defense of Gucci's ex-wife, Patrizia Reggiani
Martinelli.
	   She is charged with arranging Gucci's murder for 600 million
lire (dlrs 335 thousand) with the help of four accomplices: her
close friend and psychic Giuseppina Auriemma; hotel doorman Ivano
Savioni; Benedetto Ceraulo, a mechanic; and Cicala. The prosecution
says she wanted control of his fortune.
	   Reggiani Martinelli's lawyers deny she ordered the murder,
arguing that the others took it upon themselves to kill Gucci and
then blackmail her.
	   They also say she was mentally infirm and couldn't have given a
true mandate for her former husband's death.
	   Cicala's version, however, seemed to leave little doubt that
Reggiani Martinelli was the instigator.
	   He described several meetings with Reggiani Martinelli in which
she pressed him to carry out the killing as soon as possible,
confirming confessions earlier this week from Auriemma and Savioni.
	   ``There are two people on this earth who know the truth: me and
Mrs. Gucci,'' said Cicala.
	   Under questioning from Nocerino, Cicala said he could provide
the court with precise documentation, including addresses, messages
and other papers, as well as a receipt that Reggiani Martinelli had
asked him to sign for the money he had received.
	   Cicala also described how the killing took place, saying that at
one point he was even determined to do it himself.
	   ``She told me that money was no object. She said that it was a
matter of finding the right people and that if these people were
proper and honest and carried out the job, the price was
symbolic,'' Cicala said.

Statue in honor of baseball great stirs racial misgivings

	   KENNETT SQUARE, Pennsylvania (AP) _ Major league baseball's
struggle with integration during Jackie Robinson's rookie season
wasn't made any easier by the Philadelphia Phillies or their
general manager, Herb Pennock.
	   The Phillies, regarded at one time as the most racist team in
baseball, hurled racial insults at Robinson from the dugout their
first trip to Brooklyn of 1947. And Pennock further warned the
Dodgers not to bring the ``nigger'' to Philadelphia two weeks
later.
	   Fifty years after Pennock's death, the general manager and Hall
of Fame pitcher for the New York Yankees is again at the center of
a controversy, this time in his hometown.
	   The Historic Commission in Kennett Square wants to put up a
statue of Pennock commemorating the 50th anniversary of his
induction into the Hall of Fame. Some people in town don't want to
see it happen.
	   ``If he was a racist, I don't think he should have anything done
for him,'' said Russell Brown, who is black.
	   ``Ain't no way in hell I'll contribute,'' added Ed Brison, who
also is black.
	   About 600 blacks live in the town of 6,000, about 30 miles (50
kilometers) west of Philadelphia. The area is known for its
mushroom farms and its exploding population of Mexican migrant
workers.
	   The Historical Commission is collecting donations for the
statue, which is expected to cost dlrs 80,000. Commission
chairwoman Priscilla Roberts refused to comment Thursday.
	   Mayor Charles S. Cramer, who is black, said he understands the
concerns about Pennock but supports the idea of a statue.
	   ``I went to World War II and risked my life over there. When I
came home, they gave us a parade, but there were places I still
wasn't allowed to go,'' he said. ``The man was a great pitcher. I
don't want to hurt his image, but back in those times those things
were said.''
	   In April 1947, the Phillies manager, a Southerner named Ben
Chapman, led his players in taunting Robinson from the dugout.
Later, Pennock told Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey he would
keep the Phillies off the field if Robinson was on the roster May
9.
	   ``(You) just can't bring the nigger here, Branch. We're just not
ready for that sort of thing yet,'' Pennock said as one of Rickey's
aides, who later recalled the conversation, listened in.
	   The teams played anyway. Robinson had two hits and scored two
runs in a 6-5 Brooklyn loss.
	   Pennock died in 1948 of a brain hemorrhage, and the Phillies
would not have have a black player for nine more years.
	   ``Certainly the perception was that the Phillies organization,
back when (manager) Bob Carpenter was running it _ I wouldn't call
them racist, but they certainly did not embrace African American
players initially,'' said William Y. Giles, the Phillies' chairman
and principal owner.
	   In Burton's Barbershop in Kennett Square, where white retirees
gather daily, photographs of Pennock line the walls: one of him in
uniform, another showing him on horseback with Babe Ruth at a local
fox hunt.
	   Owner Bobby Burton, who is white, said Pennock's actions 50
years ago shouldn't be judged by today's standards.
	   ``That was the way people referred to (blacks) in those days. It
was a shame, but that's the way it was,'' Burton said. ``How many
small towns like this have a Hall of Famer like him to call their
own? As far as baseball goes in this town, he's the man.''

Mubarak flies to Libya with U.N. permission
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from Mubarak and minor edits throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak flew to
Libya on Thursday to see Col. Moammar Gadhafi on a trip for which
he had permission to override a U.N. air embargo.
	   Mubarak was accompanied by several ministers, aides and a
medical team on the flight, which Egyptian officials said was to
check on Gadhafi's health.
	   Libyan state-run television showed Mubarak greeting Gadhafi who
sat in a wheel chair. Gadhafi had an operation Monday on his hip
which he broke while exercising.
	   It was the first time the U.N. sanctions committee had given
approval for such a flight _ waivers are generally made for
humanitarian purposes only, U.N. officials said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   Egypt requested and got approval Wednesday afternoon from the
U.N. sanctions committee for the flight, said U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard. Chad and Niger, however, did not request and did not have
such approval.
	   The United Nations took note of the fact that Mubarak would be
visiting Gadhafi with a medical team, U.N. officials said.
	   The air embargo was imposed in 1992 after Gadhafi refused to
hand over two Libyans suspected in the 1988 bombing of an American
airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland that killed 270 people.
	   ``We (Arabs) are one nation and these borders are illusionary.
Libyans come to visit us and Egyptians visit Libya,'' Mubarak told
reporters with Gadhafi sitting beside him.
	   Mubarak flew from Cairo to Al-Abrak town, 60 kilometers (37
miles) from the northern seaside town of Al-Bayda, Libyan
television said in a broadcast monitored in Cairo.
	   ``President Hosni Mubarak arrived aboard an Egyptian plane at
Al-Abrak civilian airport,'' a commentator on Libyan television
said in a live broadcast from Al-Abrak where Libyan officials gave
Mubarak a red carpet welcome.
	   From Al-Abrak, Mubarak drove to Al-Bayda where he met with
Gadhafi. Al-Bayda is 1,400 kilometers (865 miles) east of Tripoli,
the Libyan capital.
	   The state Libyan television showed Mubarak shaking hands with
Gadhafi, kissing him on both cheeks, and looking at X-rays of the
broken hip.
	   Mubarak's visit was not announced. Egypt's official Middle East
News Agency only reported his arrival in Libya about the time
Libyan television started its broadcast.
	   The agency reported Mubarak's return early Thursday evening,

that he had received permission from the United Nations. Only late
Thursday did the agency report from New York that the world body
had authorized the flight to Libya.
	   Gadhafi, 56, is recovering well from his operation and resumed
normal work on Wednesday, the Libyan official news agency JANA
said. Footage of the operation was broadcast by Libyan television
on Tuesday.

Police battle Nigerian demonstrators; junta to discuss transition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to RAISE and ADD detail from inter-ethnic
fighting in Lagos, ADDS report of fighting in Ibadan. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By FRANK AIGBOGUN &QC;

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria _ Nigeria's ruling military junta debated this
embattled country's transition to democracy, while police fought
rioters Thursday as unrest flared anew over the death of the
country's most prominent political prisoner.
	   Fires lit in anger burned through parts of a popular central
market in Lagos; homes there and in the southwestern city of
Abeokuta were gutted by arsonist's fires.
	   There were no immediate reports of injuries in the fighting or
from the fires, but the bodies of at least 24 victims from violence
Wednesday have been either spotted or collected.
	   Police say the Lagos fires were set by youths enraged at the
death earlier this week of Moshood Abiola, the imprisoned
businessman who was the apparent winner of 1993's annulled
presidential elections.
	   The government says he died of a heart attack but his backers _
particularly across Nigeria's southwest where his support was the
strongest _ believe he was killed by the junta.
	   Many members of Abiola's family have also said they believed he
was killed.
	   The government says it has already completed an autopsy, but has
not yet released the results. A second independent autopsy to be
conducted by a team of visiting foreign pathologists was scheduled
for Friday.
	   On Thursday, hundreds of angry students were gathered outside
Abiola's home in the Lagos neighborhood of Ikeja, watched over by a
large detachment of riot police.
	   Abiola's son Kola angered the crowd, who accused him of siding
with the junta, after he waded through them saying ``My father was
a man of peace.''
	   Tempers were cooled after he re-emerged from the house to appeal
for calm.
	   ``This is the time for common sense so we can actualize the
ideals for which my father lived and died,'' he said.
	   The country's military junta, meanwhile, was meeting Thursday
evening to discuss plans to hand over power to civilians and
release Nigeria's remaining political prisoners.
	   They are believed to be discussing competing proposals on when
the junta should conduct fresh elections.
	   Nigeria was in the midst of a flawed transition to democracy
program when the country's former dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, died
early last month. His successor, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, has
vowed to move the country to democracy, but he has said nothing
about how it will be completed.
	   The schedule had originally called for a return to democracy by
Oct. 1, though that date seems highly improbable at this point.
	   The military's Provisional Ruling Council was also to discuss
the fate of several people convicted earlier this year of plotting
a coup against Abacha.
	   While Lagos woke up Thursday to calm streets, the situation
quickly deteriorated. Four houses were burned in Abiola's hometown
of Abeokuta, where at least ten people died in Wednesday rioting. A
dusk-to-dawn curfew did not stop demonstrators from pouring into
the streets again Thursday, where they clashed with police firing
tear gas.
	   Police say 75 people have been arrested in Abeokuta, about 70
kilometers (45 miles) north of Lagos.
	   Firefighters and police in Lagos battled a blaze that started
mid-morning in several stalls in a central market. Several houses
reportedly were also set alight by marauding groups of youths, who
police were trying to control with tear gas.
	   In a number of Lagos neighborhoods, Yorubas from Nigeria's
southwest were battling Hausas from the north of the country using
knives, clubs and bows and arrows, witnesses said.
	   In one area, Yorubas accused Hausas of celebrating Abiola's
death. Hausas and Fulanis, both ethnic groups from the north, make
up a majority in the military and the junta, while much of
Nigeria's pro-democracy leadership, including Abiola, is Yoruba.
	   Brief skirmishes between police and demonstrators also broke out
in the southwestern city of Ile-Ife, where the university has been
shut down.
	   The city of Ibadan, where at least five people were killed
Wednesday, was also reportedly the scene of renewed clashes, with
student demonstrators driving around town in a government bus they
had stolen.
	   On Wednesday, Abubakar added to Nigeria's chaotic political
situation when he dissolved his Cabinet. The military's ruling
Provisional Ruling Council, the core of the junta, was left
untouched.
	   Abubakar, in a nationwide television address Wednesday night,
called the death of Abiola a ``national tragedy'' and appealed for
calm.
	   Abiola had been in prison since 1994, but many hoped would
emerge from jail to fulfill his 1993 electoral mandate. He died
Tuesday after suddenly falling ill during a meeting with U.S.
diplomats. He was 60.
	   A potent symbol of reform for Nigeria's poor masses, Abiola was
enormously popular in Nigeria's southwest.
	   While Abiola reportedly had been very ill last year, his death
came as a surprise, just days after U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan announced that all Nigeria's political prisoners would be
freed, including Abiola.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The parents of JonBenet Ramsey, the six-year-old
murdered American beauty queen, break a 14-month silence in a
British television interview Thursday night proclaiming they are
innocent and vowing to find her killer.
	   ``I don't know what happened,'' her mother Patsy Ramsey said in
a Channel 4 documentary, according to highlights published in The
Times of London on Thursday. ``God knows, and He's not telling.''
	   JonBenet was found beaten and strangled Dec. 26, 1996 in her
home in Boulder, Colorado. There have been no arrests, and
authorities have said only that Patsy and John Ramsey are under
suspicion. The Ramseys have denied any involvement.
	   An extract of the TV interview was aired on Channel 4 news
earlier Thursday. When asked if either parent was involved in
JonBenet's death, Mr. Ramsey paused and told the documentary:
``That's the most difficult question I have ever been asked, and I
have been asked that before. I would have given my life for
JonBenet, and I regret - and I will regret for the rest of my life
- that I wasn't able to that night. No; to answer the question, no,
we did not.''

Ethnic Albanians hold ground, Yugoslavia invites international

	   JUNIK, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo's ethnic Albanian rebels held
their ground Thursday near the Albanian border after two days of
attacks by Serb security forces. International observers took
advantage of the lull in fighting to tour flash points in the
province.
	   In Vienna, Austria, the Organization of Security and Cooperation
in Europe said Yugoslavia had agreed to let an OSCE delegation
visit the country, including Kosovo, for about 10 days as part of
international efforts to end the conflict.
	   Yugoslavia has refused to accept OSCE mediation until its
membership in the 54-member organization is restored. Although the
Yugoslav agreement falls short of accepting OSCE mediation, U.S.
and European officials called the invitation a step in the right
direction.
	   The United States and the Europeans are trying to prevent
Kosovo's fighting from spreading to other Balkan countries with
substantial Albanian communities.
	   But those countries oppose independence for Kosovo _ a province
of Serbia, which is one of two republics in Yugoslavia. Both
Kosovo's Albanian moderate politicians and the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army insist on independence for the province, whose
population is overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian.
	   Albanian sources reported scattered shelling by Serbs on
Thursday near the southwestern Kosovo town of Djakovica. Serb
sources said two Albanians were killed and one wounded early
Thursday near a border outpost south of Djakovica, while attempting
to smuggle a large quantity of arms from Albania.
	   The Serbian Media Center, citing an army source, said Yugoslav
border guards shot the two after they refused to lay down their
weapons and opened fire. Neither report could be independently
confirmed.

World Cup: Croatians get day off, try to motivate for third place
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The Croatians got a day off Thursday, to get over
their semifinal defeat against France and prepare for the
consolation prize: the third-place match against the Netherlands.
	   But how do you motivate a team that has just missed its greatest
moment in history? How do you get over a major letdown for a match
that is little more than a slot-filling television exercise?
	   ``We really wanted to play the final, but now we have to
concentrate and try to be third,'' said striker Davor Suker, whose
fifth goal of the tournament had given Croatia a brief 1-0 lead.
	   ``We will be motivated and I pray that the Dutch won't be,''
Suker said. ``It will be a difficult game, but it's better to
finish third than fourth.''
	   France struck back with two goals from defender Lilian Thuram to
advance to its first World Cup final.
	   The Croatians felt they had let the match slip away. But still,
reaching the last four was a magnificent achievement for the small
Balkan nation that had gained independence from Yugoslavia in 1991
and is taking part in its first World Cup.
	   ``I think we can be really proud of what we achieved in this
World Cup. But still I can't get rid of the impression that we
could have done more,'' said coach Miroslav Blazevic.
	   The Croatians retreated to their new headquarters at Chantilly,
north of Paris, after their loss Wednesday night at the Stade de
France.
	   The players, visibly depressed after a defeat they felt could
have been easily avoided, pledged to play hard for the third place.
	   ``If we had managed to hold on to our lead for five minutes, we
would have won,'' said defender Slaven Bilic. ``But now we have to
concentrate on the match on Saturday.''
	   Midfielder Mario Stanic also expected a tough match against the
gifted Dutch team, which was beaten on penalties by Brazil in the
semifinals.
	   ``We want to finish third in our first World Cup,'' Stanic said.
	   Midfielder Aljosa Asanovic said, ``We're going to find hard for
the third place.''
	   ``We'll give everything to capture third place,'' said defender
Igor Stimac.
	   ``Whatever happens, we will have had a great World Cup,'' said
captain Zvonimir Boban.
	   Boban is suffering from muscle problems and was substituted
after his error helped France get the first goal. The AC Milan
midfielder could be doubtful for Saturday.

Schussel: Pressure needed on both Serbs and Albanians for Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
violence to end &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The international community must exert
pressure on both the Serbs and the Kosovo Albanians in order for
the conflict in the troubled Yugoslav province to end, Austria's
foreign minister said Thursday.
	   ``Pressure on both sides is needed to stop violent acts,'' said
Wolfgang Schussel, whose country currently holds the rotating
European Union presidency.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic must be convinced ``to
stop the violence against civilians and in the region,'' he said,
speaking after meeting with his Greek counterpart Theodoros
Pangalos.
	   ``On the other side, the same strong and clear message should be
sent to the Kosovo Albanians,'' he added.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo since February,
when Serb forces cracked down on ethnic Albanian militants fighting
for independence. Tens of thousands have been forced by the
fighting to flee their homes.
	   Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in the province. There
are fears the conflict could spread to other areas of the Balkans
with large Albanian populations.
	   Schussel stressed there is no international support for Kosovo
independence.
	   ``We need a political solution inside Yugoslavia,'' he said.
``The more autonomy the better. ... But we don't want separation,
we don't want a greater Albania. This is a clear message which
should be understood by the Kosovo Albanians.''
	   EU nations have increased their embassy staff in Yugoslavia in
order ``to be there, to show presence, visibility,'' Schussel said,
stressing the ``good cooperation'' between Europeans, Americans and
Russians participating in the Contact Group that coordinates
international policy for the Balkans.
	   ``If we can keep that momentum, this is the only way to avoid
additional conflict of military strikes,'' he added.
	   NATO has repeatedly threatened to use force against the Serbs if
Milosevic continues to use violence against the Kosovo Albanians.
	   But Schussel stressed responsibility for a solution to the
current crisis lies firmly with the two sides.
	   ``It's up to the two parties, Milosevic and his people on the
one side and the Albanian Kosovar people on the other, to stop the
violence and to sit down and negotiate,'' he said.

Canadian mayor faces bias complaint for opposing Gay Pride Week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FREDERICTON, New Brunswick (AP) _ The mayor of a Canadian city
appeared before a human rights tribunal Thursday to explain why,
for more than a decade, he has refused to sign a proclamation
recognizing Gay Pride Week.
	   The hearing stemmed from a complaint filed with the New
Brunswick provincial human rights commission two years ago by a
local gay-rights group against Fredericton Mayor Brad Woodside.
	   Woodside repeated to the tribunal his longstanding contention
that sexual orientation is not a matter to be dealt with by the
city council. He also dismissed suggestions that Gay Pride Week
festivities in larger cities such as Toronto have become
broad-based celebrations of diversity.
	   ``Excuse me, this is not Toronto,'' Woodside said. ``We don't
like to be compared with what they're doing in Toronto or Bangkok
or any other place.''
	   The hearing is expected to end Friday. If the tribunal decides
the complaint against Woodside is justified, it could order the
mayor to issue a Gay Pride Week proclamation and back that order
with the threat of a fine.
	   Woodside, who has been in office for almost 20 years, says a
majority of Fredericton's 50,000 people support his position.
	   There has been a similar controversy in London, Ontario, where
the city council recently voted to issue a Gay Pride proclamation
following a three-year battle between the local gay community and
the mayor.
	   A human rights inquiry in that case resulted in a dlrs 10,000
(dlrs 7,000 U.S.) fine against Mayor Dianne Haskett and the city.

Rwandan rebels kidnap one Canadian, two Rwandan nuns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Hutu rebels kidnapped three Roman Catholic
nuns _ one Canadian, the others, Rwandan _ during a deadly attack
on a city in northwestern Rwanda, residents there told the British
Broadcasting Corp. on Thursday.
	   The rebels killed an official, attacked a Catholic mission and
robbed a bank in Tuesday night's attack on Bungwe, 60 kilometers
(35 miles) north of the Rwandan capital, Kigali, the residents told
the BBC.
	   It was not immediately possible to obtain comment from Rwandan
authorities about the attack on Byumba Prefecture. The Canadian
Embassy in Kigali confirmed that the Canadian nun, a longtime
resident of Rwanda, was among the three kidnapped. Neither her name
nor her hometown were immediately available.
	   The residents said the attackers escaped pursuing government
soldiers and disappeared into heavily forested Ruhengeri
Prefecture, where they are believed to have bases.
	   Rebel attacks have killed thousands in Rwanda since November
1996, when more than 1 million Hutu refugees returned from exile.
The returning refugees included the former Hutu soldiers and
militiamen responsible for the 1994, Hutu-organized genocide of
more than 500,000 minority Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus.
	   Tutsi-led rebels overthrew the Hutu extremist government in July
1994 and stopped the killing.
	   In March, the rebels kidnapped three Spanish nuns, who were
later released unharmed.

Missionary group insists kidnapped members still alive
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JENNIFER ABRAHAMSON &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ American missionaries appealed Thursday
to leftist rebels and Colombia's incoming government to work for
the release of colleagues kidnapped in 1993 and presumed by many to
be dead.
	   ``We are convinced they are still alive,'' said Dan Germann,
Foreign Secretary of the Florida-based New Tribes Mission. He spoke
at a news conference after meeting with U.S. consular officials and
a top aide to President-elect Andres Pastrana, who takes office in
August.
	   Protestant missionaries Richard Tenenoff, David Mankins and Mark
Rich were abducted from a village in southern Panama on Jan. 31,
1993 and taken into a lawless region of Colombia dominated by the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.
	   Their captors ransom demands _ initially dlrs 5 million _ were
refused.
	   The rebels have denied responsibility, blaming the abduction on
a band of rebel deserters and Colombian soldiers posing as members
of FARC, the country's largest guerrilla group.
	   Germann said he was not accusing the FARC, but asked the rebels
to aid in their release for the good of anguished relatives.
	   ``The wives, the children, the parents, the brother and
sisters...every night before going to bed they think about Richard,
David and Mark,'' he said.
	   Gustavo Bell, who will be vice-president under Pastrana,
promised to help determine the men's fate.
	   But Colombian anti-kidnapping officials believe the missionaries
are dead.
	   Former Mideast hostages Terry Anderson and Terry Waite traveled
to Colombia in May to appeal for guerrillas to free the men or to
reveal their fate.
	   And the U.S. State Department has urged FARC, to return the men
or to provide information on their fate. But U.S. officials have
said privately it is unlikely the man are alive.
	   U.S. embassy official Mike Jacobsen on Thursday said resolving
the missionaries' fate would be ``very important'' in deciding U.S.
support for peace efforts in Colombia.

	   JUNIK, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo's ethnic Albanian rebels held
their ground near the border with Albania on Thursday after two
days of attacks by Serb security forces. International observers
took advantage of the lull in fighting to tour flash points in the
province.
	   In Vienna, Austria, the Organization of Security and Cooperation
in Europe said Yugoslavia had agreed to let an OSCE delegation
visit the country, including Kosovo, for about 10 days as part of
international efforts to end the conflict.
	   Yugoslavia has refused to accept OSCE mediation until its
membership in the 54-member organization is restored. Although
Yugoslavia stopped short of accepting OSCE mediation, U.S. and
European officials called the invitation a step in the right
direction.
	   The United States and the Europeans are trying to prevent
Kosovo's fighting from spreading to other Balkan countries with
substantial Albanian communities.
	   But those countries oppose independence for Kosovo _ a province
of Serbia, which is one of two republics in Yugoslavia. Both
Kosovo's Albanian moderate politicians and the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army insist on independence for the province, whose
population is overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian.
	   Albanian sources reported scattered shelling by Serbs on
Thursday near the southwestern Kosovo town of Djakovica. Serb
sources said two Albanians were killed and one wounded early
Thursday while attempting to smuggle a large quantity of arms from
Albania. The sources said the attack happened near a border outpost
south of Djakovica.
	   The Serbian Media Center, citing an army source, said Yugoslav
border guards shot the two after they refused to lay down their
weapons and opened fire. Neither report could be independently
confirmed.

Selig elected US baseball commissioner in unanimous vote
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Bud Selig was unanimously elected baseball's
ninth commissioner Thursday, nearly six years after he took over
the post on an acting basis.
	   Selig, the Milwaukee Brewers' owner since 1970, will put the
shares of his team in a trust. His election marks the first time an
owner was picked to fill the post. In the past, commissioners had
been independent.
	   The vote by the owners was 30-0.
	   ``I think people recognized the job that was being done,'' said
New York Mets co-owner Fred Wilpon. ``There was a great turnaround
in baseball, and Bud should get the credit. It happened on his
watch.''
	   Selig, the owner of the Brewers since 1970, was part of the
group that helped force Fay Vincent to resign on Sept. 7, 1992. He
was angered that both Vincent and Peter Ueberroth deemed themselves
impartial and immune to the owners' wishes.
	   That won't happen with Selig, called baseball's champion
vote-counter by several owners. Even though he'll have the title
and a five-year term, he'll still rule by consensus.
	   ``A commissioner is not a czar sitting above the law,'' Selig
said as his election approached. ``Yes, a commissioner has a lot of
power, but it must be confined to certain areas.''
	   His term as acting commissioner, which began two days after
Vincent's resignation, already has gone on 2,131 days, longer than
the span of four of his eight predecessors: William Eckert,
Ueberroth, A. Bartlett Giamatti and Vincent.
	   Selig presided over the start of interleague play, the
introduction of three-division leagues and wild cards and vastly
increased revenue sharing between the large- and small-market
clubs.
	   And he also was in charge during the 230-day strike that led to
a sharp dropoff in attendance and popularity. But with that behind,
he hopes the next five years will be calmer than the last five.
	   Three issues figure to dominate his agenda during the remainder
of the year: Marge Schott, the Minnesota Twins and Pete Rose.
	   Schott, the Cincinnati Reds owner, was forced to give up
day-to-day control of the team in the middle of the 1996 season
because of inflammatory remarks that angered women, blacks and
Jews. The sanctions against her expire after this season, but
baseball officials informally have discussed whether the team
should continue to operate largely without her influence.
	   ``We'll deal with that in due course,'' Selig said.
	   Rose figures to be the easiest issue for him. Baseball's career
hits leader, banned for life in 1989 following a gambling
investigation by Giamatti, has applied for reinstatement, which
would make him eligible for the Hall of Fame. Selig shows no
inclination to reverse the ban.
	   ``I think Bart did the right thing,'' Selig said earlier this
year. ``There's no reason to change that.''

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak flew to
Libya on Thursday to see Col. Moammar Gadhafi on a trip for which
he had permission to override a U.N. air embargo.
	   Mubarak was accompanied by several ministers, aides and a
medical team on the flight, which Egyptian officials said was to
check on Gadhafi's health.
	   Libyan state-run television showed Mubarak greeting Gadhafi who
sat in a wheel chair. Gadhafi had an operation Monday on his hip
which he broke while exercising.
	   It was the first time the U.N. sanctions committee had given
approval for such a flight _ waivers are generally made for
humanitarian purposes only, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
	   Egypt requested and got approval Wednesday afternoon from the
U.N. sanctions committee for the flight, Eckhard said. Chad and
Niger, however, did not request and did not have such approval.
	   The United Nations took note of the fact that Mubarak would be
visiting Gadhafi with a medical team, Ekhard said.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Leading U.S. and European
organizations have suspended funds for rebuilding Sarajevo, until
more minorities return to the capital, international officials said
Thursday.
	   The U.S. Agency for International Development and the European
Union have temporarily suspended up to dlrs 20 million of
reconstruction aid, until city officials follow through on
commitments to return up to 20,000 non-Muslims to their pre war
homes, said Simon Haselock, the spokesman for the top international
official in Bosnia.
	   Under pressure from international officials, Sarajevo city
authorities signed an agreement known as the ``Sarajevo
Declaration'' last March, pledging to return up to 20,000
non-Muslims to their prewar homes, now occupied by Muslims, by mid
1998. No comment from either USAID or the EU Missions in Sarajevo
was immediately available.
	   According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees,
only about 800 the city's prewar Croat and Serb residents have
returned.
	   According to Haselock, ``there is not sufficient progress with
the Sarajevo Declaration moving forward and as such some of these
projects have been suspended by the donors themselves.'' He said
the process of minority return will be fully reviewed by the end of
the month.
	   Sarajevo officials are unwilling expel Muslim refugees who fled
to Sarajevo from other parts of Bosnia out of the former Croat and
Serb apartments, until the Bosnian Serb republic allows them to
return home.
	   While international officials are reluctant to encourage turning
refugees into the streets, they say thousands of former Serb and
Croat apartments are occupied by local Muslim strongmen and
politicians who own several apartments and must find somewhere else
to live.
	   Since the Dayton Peace Agreement was signed in 1995, only about
2,000 non-Serbs have returned to the Bosnian Serb half of the
country and 36,000 Serbs to the Muslim-Croat federation _ half of
them to Sarajevo.

Boxing promoter Don King found innocent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A U.S. jury found boxing promoter Don King
innocent of all counts Thursday at his second trial on charges of
faking a contract to cheat Lloyd's of London out of dlrs 350,000.
	   The jury was unable to reach a verdict on charges against his
company, Don King Productions Inc.
	   ``Thank you all very much,'' King said to the jurors, then shook
the hands of each.
	   The verdict came after a 10-week trial in which prosecutors
tried to persuade jurors that the defendant who cheerily nodded and
smiled at them frequently during the trial was a crook.
	   Defense lawyers had accused prosecutors of abusing the power of
government by waging a crusade against King that threatened to tear
him down. King has been an icon of the boxing landscape for three
decades.
	   The flamboyant King did not take the witness stand, but his
testimony in a 1995 trial on the same nine wire fraud charges
figured prominently in the government's case. The 1995 trial ended
with a deadlocked jury. The charges would have carried a potential
penalty of up to 45 years in prison and a dlrs 2.2 million fine.
	   Assistant U.S. Attorney Baruch Weiss in closing arguments last
week told the jurors to remember that King admitted that it would
be wrong and deceptive to submit a fake contract to Lloyd's.
	   Prosecutors alleged that King did just that to qualify for an
extra dlrs 350,000 after a 1991 bout between Julio Cesar Chavez and
Harold Brazier was canceled because Chavez was injured in training.
	   Weiss said it would be fair for the jury to conclude that King
either altered the contract himself or ordered someone to do it,
because he kept such close tabs on every financial aspect of his
business that he even once signed a check worth a nickel.
	   ``Who was responsible for this?'' Weiss asked. ``Who else but
King? Who stood to gain from this?
	   ``But again, those two words are still there. `Wrong' and
`deceptive,' and you know, all of King's lawyers and all of King's
men just can't change King's own words at the end. `Wrong.'
`Deceptive.' ''
	   This brought lawyer William Murphy Jr. to his feet.
	   ``Objection. Now we're Humpty Dumpty?'' said Murphy,
representing Don King Productions Inc., which was added as a
defendant in the case after the previous trial.
	   The moment provided a glimpse of the kind of lively exchanges
between defense lawyers and prosecutors that sometimes went on for
hours, leaving jurors to complain of being forced to wait in the
jury room for long periods with no explanation.
	   Chavez, former WBC super lightweight champion, testified that
King paid him only dlrs 80,000 to train for Brazier and never told
him about an insurance claim. He said he knew nothing about the
insurance policy with Lloyd's that covered his training expenses or
that he would not be required to pay the expenses back to King.
	   King's lawyer, Peter Fleming Jr., told jurors that because
Lloyd's representatives understood that the insurance policy could
also cover money that had been lent to Chavez.
	   ``This is obviously complicated, detailed, smoky, obscure,
confusing,'' Fleming said in his closing statement. ``I believe you
may find this case to be a case of guesswork, an invitation to
speculate.
	   ``You may find that when a page of the contract is changed, that
can bother ordinary people, raise some sort of concern, some sort
of suspicion. You may find also that the real question is whether
the new page is honest and accurate and reflects, shows, the
agreement.
	   ``If it is fairly reflective on the first page, on the changed
page, the modified page, then you may ask yourself, `Where is the
fraud? Where is the crime?' ''

Bubka no-heights; Fredericks edges Greene in the 200
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Sergei Bubka no-heighted in the pole vault
and Frankie Fredericks edged world 100-meter champion Maurice
Greene by one-hundredth of a second in early events Thursday at the
Bislett Games.
	   Competing in chilly weather, Bubka's miseries continued in a
stadium where he often had problems in the past.
	   The Ukrainian legend, who has broken more world records (17
outdoors and 18 indoors) than any other athlete, failed to clear
his opening height at 5.60 meters.
	   ``My only comment today is 'no comment,'' said Bubka before
leaving the stadium through the back entrance, which was unlocked
on his request.
	   The 34-year-old Bubka, the only track and field athlete to win
six straight world championship gold medals, set the world record
of 6.14 meters at Sestriere, Italy, in 1994.
	   This was his third meet of the outdoor season, having cleared
5.80 in the Doha Grand Prix in May and 5.72 in Athens last month.
	   Fredericks, a two-time Olympic silver medalist from Namibia,
clocked 9.95 seconds in edging Greene. It was the fourth fastest
time of the year.
	   Frederick's winning time extended his record total of legal
sub-10-second marks to 21. Carl Lewis is second (15).
	   Francis Obikwelu of Nigeria (10.01), was third with two other
Americans, Brian Lewis (10.07) and Tim Harden (10.19) next.
	   Greene, who also clocked a 9.96 during the U.S. Championships in
New Orleans last month, only made the final as the second loser in
the qualifying heats. He was third in heat one.
	   ``The best man won,'' Greene said. ``I can't complain about it.
I'm not going to make excuses. Frankie beat me.''
	   Bryan Robson, who set the third fastest time ever in the 400
hurdles in New Orleans, won his specialty in 47.94.
	   ``I'm happy to win and with the time,'' said Robson, who had a
47.03 in New Orleans. ``But I made two mistakes at two of the
hurdles.''
	   Melissa Morrison took the women's 100 hurdles in 12.67. Cheryl
Dickey made it a double for the U.S., finishing second in 12.76.

Drummond snatches last gasp lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ Scotland's Ross Drummond fired a 66 to
go 5-under and take the lead in the 850,000-pound (dlrs 1.4
million) Loch Lomond tournament _ a tournament he was lucky to be
playing.
	   The 41-year-old Scot snatched a one-stroke lead from Lee
Westwood and Australia's Stephen Allan with a 25-foot putt on the
last hole.
	   Drummond, who has lost his tour card and was a late call-up for
the event when American Davis Love withdrew, now leads at the
halfway mark.
	   ``I couldn't even have told you what I'd scored when I
finished,'' the Paisley golfer said Thursdy.
	   ``I just focused on what I was doing. I saw with a few holes to
play I was one behind Lee, but I can't say I was trying to get to
5-under. I was just trying to play solidly.''
	   The outcome of this tournament will dictate his fate as a
professional, for the next year at least.
	   ``It would be nice if I could get my card back here, but I'm not
going to put pressure on myself,'' he said. ``Whatever happens
happens _ I'm just glad to be playing.''
	   European No.2 Lee Westwood, who shot a second successive 69,
held the lead at 4-under with Australia's Stephen Allan until the
last half-hour of play when Drummond stormed home to card the best
round of the tournament.
	   The 41-year-old Scot birdied the 16th to draw level with
Westwood and Allan, who had birdied three of the last four holes
for a 68, before taking the lead.
	   Westwood's second round 69 in the final tune-up before next
week's British Open at Royal Birkdale demonstrated he is in the
right frame of mind to win a major.
	   ``I seem to be running into form at the right time,'' Westwood
said Thursday.
	   ``As each round goes by I'm playing better and better and
feeling more and more in control. Hopefully, that will continue
next week.''
	   Westwood could have improved on his second round score but
missed birdie chances on the first two greens, three-putted the
third for par and missed a three-foot birdie putt at the ninth.
	   The 25-year-old Englishman said he was in a good position at
Loch Lomond and was confident of continueing his form into the
British Open.
	   Sweden's Dennis Edlund is three under after his second-round 69.
	   Westwood's playing partner Andrew Coltart _ brother of his
fiance Laurae _ fired two birdies in his first three holes and
finished with 69 to go 2-under.
	   He was level with first round leader Ian Woosnam, who shot a
disappointing 73 after his 67 on Wednesday, Scotland's Gary Orr and
England's Paul Broadhurst.
	   Defending champion Tom Lehman played in the worst of the weather
on Wednesday to card 73 but returned to better form Thursday to
fire a 68 and get back into contention at 1-under.
	   European No.1 Colin Montgomerie, still seeking his first win on
home soil, shot a 71 after a double bogey on the 14th and was
1-over at the halfway mark.
	   Spain's Sergio Garcia, the British amateur champion, shot a 71
to go with his first round 71 and is even-par with two rounds to
play.
	   U.S. amateur champion Matt Kuchar, playing in his first European
tour event, shot 76 to go with his first-round 73.

Report: Albright tells Netanyahu negotiations on withdrawal over
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS for AMs. LEADS throughout with reported
Albright-Netanyahu phone call, INCORPORATES material from
Israel-House Demolitions; ADDS Byline &QL; 
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel television said in an unattributed
report Thursday that the United States has told Israel it is
through negotiating the terms of a West Bank troop withdrawal and
wants an answer on its proposal within two weeks.
	   The report said that in a heated telephone conversation with
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright threatened to go public with a report on the
status of the deadlocked peace talks, if Israel and the
Palestinians failed to make headway on cinching an agreement within
the next two weeks.
	   Netanyahu's spokesman Shai Bazak called the TV report
``inaccurate,'' but declined further comment. Netanyahu's senior
advisor David Bar-Illan said he had no knowledge of the phone call.
	   The United States has said repeatedly that it would reassess its
role as mediator in talks which have been stalled for 16 months, if
it saw that no progress was being made.
	   The U.S. has been pressuring Israel to accept its proposal to
restart the peace process which includes an Israeli troop
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank. Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat accepted the ideas proposed in January and has said
he would not renegotiate the terms.
	   However, Arafat dispatched two senior Palestinian negotiators to
Washington Thursday, apparently at the request of Albright. But
Palestinian Cabinet Minister Hanan Ashrawi said the two envoys will
listen, but ``will not renegotiate the (U.S.) initiative,'' Ashrawi
told a news conference.
	   Israel radio said Thursday that Washington has agreed to slight
cosmetic changes in the original initiative.
	   Netanyahu, who has been haggling with the U.S. over the plan,
originally rejected a 13 percent withdrawal as dangerous to
Israel's security but is now reportedly willing to cede 10 percent
and retain control over zoning and planning in the remaining 3
percent.
	   Earlier Thursday, Netanyahu said any deal hinged on Palestinian
compliance with a list of commitments they made in previous
accords, including extradition of suspects in the killings of
Israelis, and an annulment of sections in the PLO Covenant which
call for Israel's destruction.
	   ``We are moving forward in the process, at present mainly in
very intensive contacts with the Americans that have moved the
process forward to no small degree,'' Netanyahu said.
	   The Palestinians have accused Netanyahu of playing for time in
hopes of eventually wriggling out of his commitment to hand over
more land. ``The peace process is not only in a state of deadlock.
We feel that it has been destroyed by Netanyahu,'' Ashrawi said.
	   Ashrawi complained that the United States was not pressing
Israel hard enough. ``We recognize that so far every single
deadline and every single timetable the United States has presented
has been violated by Israel,'' she said.
	   In other developments Thursday, the army demolished five
Palestinian structures in the West Bank built without
Israeli-issued permits.
	   Palestinians complain that Israel uses house demolitions as a
political tool and refuses to issue building permits in areas of
the West Bank it wants to keep under its control.
	   The United States has said house demolitions send the wrong
signal to the Palestinians at a time when trust between the sides
is low and Israeli-Palestinian peace talks remained deadlock
despite American efforts to revive them.
	   And in the divided West Bank city of Hebron, Israeli troops
imposed a curfew on parts of the city after shots were fired at a
car driven by Jewish settlers. No one was hurt in the Wednesday
night shooting, but several bullets struck the car, the army said
and Palestinian radio said three Palestinian had been taken for
questioning.

Rangers sign MacLean
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The New York Rangers signed free-agent right
wing John MacLean on Thursday in an attempt to boost their
struggling offense.
	   Terms of the deal were not disclosed, although MacLean
reportedly was offered a dlrs 5 million, two-year deal by the
Toronto Maple Leafs. The Los Angeles Kings were also interested in
MacLean.
	   The Rangers scored just 197 goals last season, fifth-worst in
the league, as they finished out of the playoffs for the first time
in five years.
	   MacLean, who was traded last December from New Jersey to San
Jose, had 16 goals and 27 assists last season. MacLean, originally
drafted by New Jersey in 1983, has 360 career goals and 373
assists, in his 15-year career.
	   MacLean's scoring will be welcomed by a Rangers' team that got
little consistent offense from players other than Wayne Gretzky,
who finished tied for third in the league scoring race, and Pat
LaFontaine, the team's leading goal-scorer before he was sidelined
by a concussion late in the season.
	   MacLean, a 6-foot (1.8-meter), 200-pound (90-kilogram) forward,
has scored 20 or more goals in a season 10 times, has six career
hat tricks and led the Devils in goals five times. He is New
Jersey's career leader in games, goals and assists.
	   MacLean's career highlights include playing in National Hockey
League All-Star games in 1989 and 1991, playing for Team Canada at
the 1989 World Championships and the 1984 World Junior
Championships, and being named to the Memorial Cup of the Canadian
Major Junior Hockey Championship All-Star Team in 1982-83.

Disneyland Paris strikers meet labor officials
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Rallied by Mickey Mouse and Snow White, about 50
striking Disneyland Paris parade performers took their grievances
to the Labor Ministry on Thursday.
	   While union officials met with Labor Minister Martine Aubry, the
strikers _ one dressed as Minnie Mouse, another as Mickey _ sang
and danced at the entrance.
	   ``Mickey needs you!'' strikers shouted to passers-by through a
loudspeaker.
	   One was dressed as a prisoner, a ball-and-chain around one of
his feet, to symbolize what he called Euro Disney's imprisoning of
its workers into low-pay contracts.
	   Michel Gautherin, one of seven union officials to meet with
Aubry, said the strike over a pay dispute would continue
indefinitely, and appealed to management to meet workers' demands.
	   The performers wantreclassified as ``artists'' rather than
``extras.'' That would not only raise their pay but give them a
more prestigious status.
	   Gautherin said the Labor Ministry had referred them elsewhere.
	   ``They explained to us that they're not taking a position, that
they only enforce labor laws, that they don't interpret the laws,''
Gautherin said. ``That's for the Justice Ministry.''
	   The workers say they will now march on the Justice Ministry.
	   Disneyland Paris says the strikers have permanent contracts,
much better benefits, and an extra month's bonus _ none of which
they would have at other French theme parks, where work is only
seasonal.

Lebanon accuses 18 ex-Christian militiamen of bombings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ A prosecutor accused 18 former members of
a Christian militia Thursday of trying to destabilize the country
through a bombing campaign, the state-run news agency reported.
	   Prosecutor Nasri Lahoud also accused the ex-members of the
right-wing Lebanese Forces of trying to get arms from Israel, a
crime punishable by death in Lebanon which is technically at war
with the Jewish state.
	   Eleven of the 18 accused were handed over to the prosecutor
Thursday by the Lebanese army's intelligence department. The other
seven accused are still at large, the National News Agency
reported.
	   No date has been set for their trial, but it is expected to take
place in a military court owing to its state security nature.
	   In his indictment, Lahoud charged the 18 with forming ``a gang
with the aim of attacking people and properties and attempting to
carry out terrorist acts with bombs and inflammable material.''
	   He also accused the 18 of planning to assassinate two cabinet
ministers.
	   Lahoud did not name the ministers, but the National News Agency
said last week that the group had targeted Interior Minister Michel
Murr and Minister of Electricity and Hydraulic Resources Elias
Hobeika.
	   The indictment said the 18 were behind a bus bomb explosion in
Damascus, Syria, in 1996 that killed 11 people; a 1996 attack on a
Syrian bus in Lebanon that killed its driver; and an explosion at
the main Beirut bus terminal in October 1997 that caused no
casualties.
	   It added that two members of the group were killed in Beirut on
June 12 when one of their bombs exploded prematurely.
	   The main Christian militia during the 1975-90 civil war, the
Lebanese Forces was disbanded by the government in 1994. During the
war, the LF opposed Syrian influence in Lebanon and had close ties
to Israel.
	   Syria today maintains some 30,000 soldiers in Lebanon and is the
main power broker in the country.
	   The charges against the 18 came a day after Lahoud accused 77
people of spying for Israel by providing information on Lebanese
and Syrian troop movements and Lebanese guerrillas.

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ A bomb exploded Thursday at a crowded
flea market in an Algiers suburb, killing 10 people and injuring 21
others, a communique from the hospital services said.
	   About 1,000 people were at the market when the bomb went off
about 9 a.m, causing people to run away in panic in all directions.
	   The explosive apparently was concealed in a shopping basket.
	   The Algerian government has been fighting an Islamic insurgency
since 1992 that has left an estimated 75,000 people dead, mostly in
bombings and massacres.
	   One of the leading ``emirs'' of the Armed Islamic Group, the
most violent movement in the insurgency, was killed on Thursday,
Algeria's security forces said in a statement.
	   Athmane Khelifa, who goes by the name ``Flicha,'' was killed,
along with ten Islamic militants, in an attack on their hideout in
hills outside Algiers. Khelifa was a leading GIA official in the
Algiers region.
	   A large amount of weapons was seized from the hideout, according
to the statement, which said the militants had been ``eliminated.''
No further details were given.
	   Thursday's bombing came just before a march organized by the
Front of Socialist Forces to protest a law that bans all languages
except Arabic from official use.
	   Tens of thousands of people, many holding banners criticizing
the law and the violence wracking this North African nation, took
part in the march through Algiers.
	   The Front also wants the government to give official status to
the Tamazight language, which is used by Berbers, who make up about
one-third of Algeria's population.
	   The new law took effect Sunday. It is opposed by the Berber
community, which is still in shock over the murder last month of a
popular Berber singer. Islamic militants claimed responsibility for
that killing.
	   Many Algerians believe the government is seeking to appease
Islamic groups with the Arabic-only language law.

U.S. government and European Union suspend aid to Sarajevo

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Leading U.S. and European
organizations are withholding funds for rebuilding Sarajevo until
more minorities return to the Bosnian capital, international
officials said Thursday.
	   The U.S. Agency for International Development and the European
Union have halted up to dlrs 20 million of reconstruction aid until
city officials allow up to 20,000 non-Muslims to return to their
prewar homes, said Simon Haselock, the spokesman for the top
international official in Bosnia.
	   Under pressure from international officials, Sarajevo city
authorities signed an agreement in March pledging to return up to
20,000 Bosnian Serbs and Croats to their prewar homes, now occupied
by Muslims, by the middle of this year.
	   According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees,
only about 800 of the city's prewar Croat and Serb residents have
returned.
	   No comment from either USAID or the EU Missions in Sarajevo was
immediately available.
	   Haselock said the process of minority return will be fully
reviewed by the end of the month.
	   Sarajevo officials are unwilling to expel Muslim refugees who
fled to Sarajevo from other parts of Bosnia.
	   However, international officials say thousands of the former
Serb and Croat apartments are occupied by local Muslim strongmen
and politicians who own several apartments.

Don King found innocent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with background; ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By LARRY NEUMEISTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A federal jury found boxing promoter Don King
innocent of all counts Thursday at his second trial on charges of
faking a contract to cheat Lloyd's of London out of dlrs 350,000.
	   The jury was unable to reach a verdict on charges against his
company, Don King Productions Inc.
	   ``Thank you all very much,'' King said to the jurors, then shook
the hands of each.
	   King has had several brushes with the law and once served time
in prison on a conviction of beating a man to death.
	   The verdict came after a 10-week trial in which prosecutors
tried to convince jurors that the defendant who cheerily nodded and
smiled at them frequently during the trial was a crook.
	   Prosecutors alleged that King submitted a fake contract to
Lloyd's to qualify for an extra dlrs 350,000 after a 1991 bout
between Julio Cesar Chavez and Harold Brazier was canceled because
Chavez was injured in training.
	   Defense lawyers had accused prosecutors of abusing the power of
government by waging a crusade against King that threatened to tear
him down. King has been an icon of the boxing landscape for three
decades.
	   King did not take the witness stand, but his testimony in a 1995
trial on the same nine wire fraud charges figured prominently in
the government's case. The 1995 trial ended with a deadlocked jury.
The charges would have carried a potential penalty of up to 45
years in prison and a dlrs 2.2 million fine.
	   Assistant U.S. Attorney Baruch Weiss in closing arguments last
week told the jurors to remember that King admitted that it would
be wrong and deceptive to submit a fake contract to Lloyd's.
Prosecutors alleged that King did just that.
	   Weiss said it would be fair for the jury to conclude that King
either altered the contract himself or ordered someone to do it,
because he kept such close tabs on every financial aspect of his
business that he even once signed a check worth a nickel.
	   ``Who was responsible for this?'' Weiss asked. ``Who else but
King? Who stood to gain from this?
	   ``But again, those two words are still there. `Wrong' and
`deceptive,' and you know, all of King's lawyers and all of King's
men just can't change King's own words at the end. `Wrong.'
`Deceptive.'''
	   This brought lawyer William Murphy Jr. to his feet.
	   ``Objection. Now we're Humpty Dumpty?'' said Murphy,
representing Don King Productions Inc., which was added as a
defendant in the case after the previous trial.
	   The moment provided a glimpse of the kind of lively exchanges
between defense lawyers and prosecutors that sometimes went on for
hours, leaving jurors to complain of being forced to wait in the
jury room for long periods with no explanation.
	   Chavez, former WBC super lightweight champion, testified that
King paid him only dlrs 80,000 to train for Brazier and never told
him about an insurance claim. He said he knew nothing about the
insurance policy with Lloyd's that covered his training expenses or
that he would not be required to pay the expenses back to King.
	   King's lawyer, Peter Fleming Jr., told jurors that because
Lloyd's representatives understood that the insurance policy could
also cover money that had been lent to Chavez.
	   ``This is obviously complicated, detailed, smoky, obscure,
confusing,'' Fleming said in his closing statement. ``I believe you
may find this case to be a case of guesswork, an invitation to
speculate.
	   ``You may find that when a page of the contract is changed, that
can bother ordinary people, raise some sort of concern, some sort
of suspicion. You may find also that the real question is whether
the new page is honest and accurate and reflects, shows, the
agreement.
	   ``If it is fairly reflective on the first page, on the changed
page, the modified page, then you may ask yourself, `Where is the
fraud? Where is the crime?'''
	   King has been the subject of at least three grand jury
investigations. In the one federal case that reached trial, he was
acquitted of tax evasion charges in 1985.
	   In 1954, he killed a man who was robbing a numbers house he
operated in Cleveland. It was ruled self defense. In 1967, he was
convicted in Cleveland of the beating death of a man who owed him
money and served four years in prison. After his release, King was
pardoned in 1983 by then-Ohio Gov. James A. Rhodes just before he
left office.

Investigation into church's finances chips away at secrecy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recasts throughout to ADD details on allegations, comments
from Greek media. No pickup. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ An investigation into the Greek Orthodox
Church's finances has triggered a national scandal, raising
troubling questions about the powerful church and its secretive
business dealings.
	   The probe, which has taken more than a year, has brought to
light the archaic manner used to manage the church's vast fortune.
But critics say the investigation must go further.
	   ``There is no control,'' said Nitsa Loule, a leftist
Parliamentary deputy. ``No one oversees their budget, or how they
spend their money.''
	   On Thursday, church leaders called for millions of dollars in
missing money to be tracked down. But critics say the church, the
country's largest landowner, must do more to lower its wall of
secrecy.
	   The matter has provided grist for talk shows and political
cartoonists. In one of the many editorials on the matter, the
Athens daily Ethnos called the investigation ``a fire that burns
many.''
	   Archbishop Christodoulos, who was elected head of the Greek
church in April, has tried to use the battle against negligence and
embezzlement to give the embattled church a new image.
	   A recent 450-page report detailed crimes such as mismanagement
and theft from 1988 to 1986. Initially commissioning the report as
an internal investigation, church leaders reluctantly turned the
document over to a public prosecutor Wednesday after stalling for
three days.
	   Several members of parliament have also asked for copies,
grumbling that the church has been allowed to keep its financial
matters under wraps for too long. Several deputies want to look
into church finances and the lack of oversight.
	   Estimates place the church's fortune _ which it won't reveal _
at about dlrs 1 billion. In addition, the church enjoys tax-free
status, and the state pays the salaries of the country's 12,000
clerics and gives large grants to restore monasteries and churches.
	   The revelations about the church's disordered finances have
rekindled an old debate about the institution's untouchable status.
	   Church leaders wield considerable influence and often are more
popular than political leaders. And despite a string of scandals,
including the alleged embezzlement of collection plate money at one
church, few clergymen have been punished.
	   ``No matter how much these findings may hurt the church, they
are beneficial,'' said Father Ignatius, a church spokesman said
Thursday. ``This investigation will create conditions so that such
things don't happen again.''
	   Church officials on Thursday called for an investigation into
millions of dollars of missing money. Although so far only lay
employees have been implicated, the bishops and metropolitans who
supervise them will be held accountable, church leaders said.
	   ``Clergy supervised lay employees and certainly are responsible
for being extremely negligent,'' said Metropolitan Maximos of
Serres, who spoke for the Holy Synod during its three-day meeting
about the financial report.
	   After the Holy Synod met Thursday, Church leaders said they had
asked two private citizens to return dlrs 2 million withdrawn from
church accounts.
	   Lay employees were given until Friday to return tens of
thousands of dollars more in missing or embezzled money.
	   The announcements did not give details on the allegations.
	   Many are wondering how deep the church is willing to cut to
remove financial corruption.
	   ``The bell tolls only for lay employees as metropolitans hide
their own responsibility,'' said the respected Athens daily
Eleftherotypia in a headline.
	   Alleged scandals range from renovation grants spent for other
purposes to vast embezzlement schemes involving church property
leased in complicated scams.
	   Politicians recently backed off a proposal to constitutionally
separate church and state. Orthodoxy is Greece's official religion
and more than 90 percent of the country is baptized in the church.
	   A full conference of Greece's 80 bishops will meet in October
after examining the report. Afterwards, it may file criminal
charges.

Amnesty: 11 prisoners on death row for treason in Equatorial Guinea
</HEADLINE>
are starving &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Eleven political prisoners sentenced to
death for treason in Equatorial Guinea could die of starvation in
their cells, the international human rights group Amnesty
International said Thursday.
	   ``Unless something is done to improve their situation
immediately, executions will not be necessary to kill many of
them,'' the group warned in a statement that stressed the prisoners
were suffering from dehydration and hunger.
	   A military court in this former Spanish colony of 400,000
inhabitants handed down the death sentences to the 11 Equatorial
Guineans, and four others tried in their absence, on June 1st, at
the end of a mass treason trial of over 110 people.
	   Amnesty said the trial and convictions appeared to be motivated
by the desire to crack down on groups representing the ethnic Bubi
minority in this tiny west African country.
	   Although President Teodoro Obiang suspended the executions, due
to take place by firing squad, he has yet to bow to international
pressure to commute the death sentences to jail terms, the Amnesty
statement said.
	   The group sent observers to the trial which concluded with jail
sentences of between six and 26 years for a further seventy
defendants. The exact numbers of the numbers tried, convicted and
absolved were not available.
	   ``All the convictions were based on confessions extracted under
torture'' Amnesty's statement said.
	   The charges stemmed from an attack in January on a military
barracks on the Equatorial Guinean island of Bioko _ the home of
most of the ethnic Bubi.
	   Many of the condemned belong to the Bioko Autonomy Movement, an
outlawed political group that strongly opposes Obiang.
	   Amnesty, along with several European countries and the United
States, has long accused Obiang's government of human rights
violations.
	   Obiang seized power in this oil-rich country wedged between
Cameroon and Gabon in 1979 by overthrowing his uncle Francisco
Macias Nguema.
	   Some 500 people, mostly Bubi, were arrested in the military
crackdown that followed the January attack, which left four
soldiers and one civilian dead.
	   Amnesty's statement said that at least six people died during
pretrial detention and many of those convicted were still weak from
the torture they received.

German foreign minister lobbies Macedonia for support on Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kinkel to returnin in graf 11. Deletes extranious
words in graf 1. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SKJOPE, Macedonia (AP) _ Germany's foreign minister praised
Macedonia as a stabilizing factor in the Balkans Thursday and
lobbied the government to help contain violence within Kosovo's
borders.
	   ``Dreams of greater Albania were and never will be supported,''
Klaus Kinkel told reporters at a news conference, following
discussions with his Macedonian counterpart Blagoje Hadzinski.
	   Earlier in the day, Kinkel visited Albania's northern border,
where he met with ethnic Albanian refugees from Kosovo. On
Wednesday, he pressured Tirana for support in finding a peaceful
solution to the crisis in Kosovo.
	   In Macedonia, Kinkel reiterated the two primary strategic aims
of international officials trying to calm the crisis were to
decrease the violence in the province and prevent the conflict from
spilling over into neighboring countries _such as Macedonia and
Albania.
	   Germany is especially worried that increased fighting between
Serb security forces and ethnic Albanians will force thousands of
refugees to flee and seek asylum on its doorstep.
	   Kinkel also held an unscheduled meeting with Fehmi Agani, a
close aide to Rugova and member of the Kosovo Albanian negotiating
team, during which he explained the position of the six-nation
Contact Group.
	   The Contact Group _ which along with Germany, includes the
United States, Russia, France, Britain and Italy _ supports
autonomy, but not independence for Kosovo.
	   Ethnic Albanians in Kosovo outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 and seek
independence from Serbia, which together with Montenegro makes up
Yugoslavia.
	   Agani told reporters after the meetings that while independence
was the Albanian's position, it was not a precondition for
dialogue. ``We hope to attain independence through dialogue,'' he
said.
	   ``The international community's standing on the matter of
autonomy for Kosovo is a broad concept which we suppose includes a
confederal or a federal status,'' Agani concluded.
	   Kinkel was to return to Bonn following Thrusday's meetings.

Stoltenberg defeats Hewitt in Hall of Fame tennis tournament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEWPORT, Rhode Island (AP) _ Top-seeded Jason Stoltenberg got
his revenge by defeating fellow Australian Lleyton Hewitt in
straight sets in the second round of the Hall of Fame Tennis
Championships on Thursday.
	   Stoltenberg, 28, defeated Hewitt 6-1, 6-3, breaking the
youngster's serve six out of eight games. Earlier this year,
Hewitt, 17, defeated Stoltenberg in the finals to win the
Australian Men's Hardcourt Championships in Hewitt's hometown of
Adelaide.
	   ``I used my grass court experience,'' Stoltenberg, 35th in the
ATP ratings, said. ``He's a little inexperienced, a little
impatient perhaps.''
	   Stoltenberg broke Hewitt's serve all three games in the first
set. After Hewitt went up 3-0 in the second set, Stoltenberg fought
off two break points with an ace and a service winner, and went on
to win the final six games of the match.
	   ``He came up with two big serves,'' said Hewitt, who didn't have
an ace in the match. ``If I had won one of those, we'd still be in
the third set.
	   ``He was more used to the surface than I was,'' said Hewitt.
``He played a lot smarter. I played in patches today.''
	   Only one other of the tournament's eight seeds advanced to the
quarterfinals, seventh-seeded John Van Lottum of the Netherlands,
who outlasted American David Wheaton 7-5, 1-6, 6-3.
	   Defending champion Sargis Sargsian, the fourth seed, lost to
Rainer Schuttler of Germany 6-2, 6-7 (7-0), 6-4 in a match
suspended Wednesday and completed Thursday.
	   Sargsian, who became the first Armenian to win an ATP tournament
here a year ago, said the interruption of his match due to
Wednesday's rain did not make a difference. Sargsian had just won
the second set tiebreaker 7-0 when the match was suspended.
	   ``Actually, I was happy we stopped,'' he said. ``I was upset
with the way I started the match.''
	   Van Lottum, 22, who is coming off a fourth-round showing at
Wimbledon, won't benefit much from being the only other seed still
remaining. He plays Stoltenberg in the quarterfinals.
	   ``If I play as well as I did at Wimbledon and as I have here, I
should win,'' Van Lottum said.

Report: Albright tells Netanyahu negotiations on withdrawal over
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout to LEAD with reported Albright-Netanyahu
phone call, information on house demolitions. ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The United States has told Israel it is through
negotiating the terms of a West Bank troop withdrawal and wants an
answer on its proposal within two weeks, according to an
unattributed report Thursday on Israel television.
	   The report said that U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
held a heated telephone conversation with Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu in which she threatened to go public with a report on the
status of the deadlocked peace talks if Israel and the Palestinians
failed to make headway on an agreement within two weeks.
	   Netanyahu's spokesman Shai Bazak called the TV report
``inaccurate,'' but declined further comment. Netanyahu's senior
advisor David Bar-Illan said he had no knowledge of the phone call.
	   The United States has said repeatedly that it would reassess its
role as mediator in talks, which have been stalled for 16 months,
if no progress was being made.
	   The United States has been pressuring Israel to accept its
proposal, which includes an Israeli troop withdrawal from 13
percent of the West Bank. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat accepted
the ideas proposed in January and has said he would not renegotiate
the terms.
	   However, Arafat dispatched two senior Palestinian negotiators to
Washington on Thursday, apparently at Albright's request.
Palestinian Cabinet Minister Hanan Ashrawi said the two envoys will
listen, but ``will not renegotiate the (U.S.) initiative.''
	   Israel radio said Thursday that Washington has agreed to slight
cosmetic changes in the original plan.
	   Netanyahu originally rejected a 13 percent withdrawal as
dangerous to Israel's security but is now reportedly willing to
cede 10 percent and retain control over zoning and planning in the
remaining 3 percent.
	   Earlier Thursday, Netanyahu said any deal hinged on Palestinian
compliance with a list of commitments they made in previous
accords, including extraditing suspects in the killings of
Israelis, and annulling sections in the PLO Covenant that call for
Israel's destruction.
	   ``We are moving forward in the process, at present mainly in
very intensive contacts with the Americans that have moved the
process forward to no small degree,'' Netanyahu said.
	   The Palestinians have accused Netanyahu of playing for time in
hopes of eventually wriggling out of his commitment to hand over
more land. ``The peace process is not only in a state of deadlock.
We feel that it has been destroyed by Netanyahu,'' Ashrawi said.
	   Ashrawi complained that the United States was not pressing
Israel hard enough. ``We recognize that so far every single
deadline and every single timetable the United States has presented
has been violated by Israel,'' she said.
	   In other developments Thursday, the army demolished five
Palestinian structures in the West Bank built without
Israeli-issued permits.
	   Palestinians complain that Israel uses house demolitions as a
political tool and refuses to issue building permits in areas of
the West Bank it wants to keep under its control.
	   The United States has said house demolitions send the wrong
signal to the Palestinians at a time when trust between the sides
is low and Israeli-Palestinian peace talks remained deadlock
despite American efforts to revive them.
	   In the divided West Bank city of Hebron, Israeli troops also
imposed a curfew on parts of the city after shots were fired at a
car driven by Jewish settlers. No one was hurt in the Wednesday
night shooting, but several bullets struck the car, the army said.
Palestinian radio said three Palestinian had been taken for
questioning.

JonBenet's parents portrayed as victims of ``witch hunt''
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EDITS, ADDS details of program

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The parents of JonBenet Ramsey, the six-year-old
murdered American beauty queen, broke a 14-month silence in a
British television documentary aired Thursday that portrayed them
as victims of a ``modern-day witch hunt.''
	   ``I don't know what happened,'' Patsy Ramsey said of her
daughter's death in the Channel 4 documentary. ``God knows, and
He's not telling.''
	   JonBenet was found beaten and strangled Dec. 26, 1996 in her
home in Boulder, Colorado. There have been no arrests, and
authorities have said only that Patsy and John Ramsey are under
suspicion. The Ramseys deny involvement.
	   The program quoted friends and relatives saying that from the
day after the killing, the Ramseys were the victims of leaks from
police designed to pressure them into admitting guilt, and also
quoted doctors saying that there was no evidence that JonBenet was
sexually abused.
	   John Ramsey said that when he was told that police had tried to
withhold his daughter's body for burial in order to force an
interrogation, he lost all confidence in them.
	   ``They were not there to help us, they were there to hang us. We
became very suspicious, defensive, untrusting,'' he said.
	   Mr. Ramsey denied allegations that he was a consumer of
pornography and that he had abused his other children, a view
supported by interviews with the children of his first marriage and
his first wife.
	   Francesco Beuf, a doctor who saw JonBenet 27 times for a variety
of mild illnesses and colds, said there was no sign that she was
being sexually abused.
	   ``I saw absolutely no signs of sexual abuse. I had no suspicion
of it. I always think about sexual abuse with any child ... who
comes through this practice, because it is such a terribly
destructive thing ... in JonBenet's case I saw absolutely no
evidence,'' Beuf said.
	   JonBenet, dressed in a pink cowgirl outfit singing ``I Wanna Be
A Cowboy's Sweatheart,'' or posing in elaborate clothes, wearing
make-up and high heels, has become known throughout the United
States through coverage of her unsolved killing.
	   When asked if either parent was involved in JonBenet's death,
Mr. Ramsey paused and told the documentary: ``That's the most
difficult question I have ever been asked, and I have been asked
that before. I would have given my life for JonBenet, and I regret
- and I will regret for the rest of my life - that I wasn't able to
that night. No; to answer the question, no, we did not.''
	   ``How do u say `no` any more clearly than `no?`'' Mrs. Ramsey
said.
	   ``The American public has been led to believe that, after a
wonderful Christmas, we brutally beat JonBenet, sexually molested
her, strangled her, went to sleep, got up the next morning, wrote a
ransom note, called the police, sat around the house for four
hours, then I went downstairs and discovered her body and was able
to act distraught,'' Mr. Ramsey said.

New Spanish senate commission begins experiment in virtual
</HEADLINE>
democracy &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spanish citizens have been asked to
participate in an experiment in virtual democracy on the Internet
by contributing to the debates of a new senate commission set up
precisely to study the impact and possibilities of the web.
	   According to Senator Esteban Gonzalez Pons, president of the
commission that started work one month ago, ``the opinions of the
citizens will be as important as those of the senators when the
time comes to reach conclusions,'' the national news agency EFE
reported Thursday.
	   ''If the experience is positive, people participate, and the
debate is constructive then in a little while all Spanish
parliamentary commissions could have a virtual forum of debate on
the web open to the citizen,'' EFE quoted Gonzalez Pons as saying.
	   The Spanish project follows similar pages in the United States
and France, EFE said.
	   According to the introductory blurb on the new site the
commission's purpose is ``to examine the political, economic,
social, cultural and technological consequences of the phenomenon
of the Internet.''
	   These include the kind of jobs that will be created and
destroyed by the mass transfer of information on the web, how the
Internet influences consumer habits, and what the consequences of
electronic elections could be.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spanish citizens have been asked to
participate in an experiment in virtual democracy on the Internet
by contributing to the debates of a new senate commission set up to
study the possibilities of the Internet.
	   ``The opinions of the citizens will be as important as those of
the senators when the time comes to reach conclusions,'' commission
head Senator Esteban Gonzalez Pons was quoted as saying by the
national news agency EFE Thursday.
	   ``If the experience is positive, people participate, and the
debate is constructive, then in a little while, all Spanish
parliamentary commissions could have a virtual forum of debate on
the Web open to the citizen,'' EFE quoted Gonzalez Pons as saying.
	   The Spanish project follows similar Internet sites in the United
States and France, EFE said.
	   According to the site, the commission's purpose is ``to examine
the political, economic, social, cultural and technological
consequences of the phenomenon of the Internet.''
	   These include the kind of jobs that will be created and
destroyed by the mass transfer of information on the Internet, how
the Internet influences consumer habits and what the consequences
of electronic elections could be.

Tunisia's last diplomat in Israel leaves without successor named
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Tunisia's last remaining diplomat in
Israel has returned home amid reports that the North African nation
is angry over Israel's handling of Mideast peace.
	   But an Israeli foreign ministry spokesman said Thursday he
believes a replacement would be sent for Mohammed Nabil Saqar, who
held the number two position at Tunisia's interests office in Tel
Aviv.
	   As a result of historic peace accords between Israel and the PLO
in 1993, Israel developed low-level ties with several Arab
countries including Tunisia, Qatar, Oman and Morocco, and signed a
full peace agreement with Jordan.
	   But Saqar's departure signaled a further deterioration in the
relations between The Jewish state and the Arab world since the
collapse of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks 16 months ago.
	   Last August, Tunisia recalled the head of its mission to Israel.
Shiron said the office would be run for the time being by local
staff.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Saboteurs exploded a bomb in an
abandoned house behind the Puerto Rico Telephone Co. at dawn
Thursday, showing that pockets of strong resistance remain to the
company's privatization even as a huge general strike petered out.
	   Police patrolling the area, where picketers remain day and
night, said they arrested five males _ two just 15 years old _ with
four other primitive bombs made of acid, metal, keys and shards of
glass.
	   They identified the adults arrested as Alex Noel Ramos Vazquez,
21, and Luis A. Morales Andaluz, 20, both unemployed, and
construction worker Heriberto Olivera Vargas, 21. The three are
from the town of Bayamon just south of San Juan.
	   The arrests came hours after union leaders ended a 48-hour
general strike that began Tuesday with a dramatic blockade of the
main airport, an aborted bombing and the strafing of a bank. The
strike fizzled Wednesday to picket line scuffles with police and an
ax attack on a telephone pole.
	   The general strike was called in support of 6,400 telephone
workers who continue their three-week-old strike.
	   For the first time Thursday, government officials indicated they
were ready to talk to the strikers, though not about the sale.
	   ``We can talk about conditions for them to return to work and
other matters, but the decision to sell Telefonica _ that's already
made,'' Secretary of State Norma Burgos told a news conference.
	   Gov. Pedro Rossello last week signed a bill completing the dlrs
1.9 billion sale to a consortium led by GTE Corp. of Stamford,
Connecticut, and Banco Popular, the island's largest bank.
	   However, the government committee in charge of the sale said
Thursday it was giving serious consideration to a belated offer
from the Spanish company Telefonica Internacional S.A., and would
make its decision the week of July 20.
	   The Spaniards took advantage of the dissension to make a higher
bid of dlrs 2.1 billion, which would more than cover the dlrs 25
million breakup fee if Puerto Rico abandons its agreement with GTE.
	   The Spanish company reportedly has done a better job of winning
over the unions, who fear thousands of job losses.
	   Puerto Rican officials' recent willingness to talk to the
strikers appeared to be a reaction to indications that strikers
might be ready to return to work next week if the government
promises no reprisals.
	   Labor leaders were to meet Thursday evening to discuss a change
of strategy that could include periodic 24-hour walkouts, said
Annie Cruz of the Independent Brotherhood of Telephone Employees.
	   Economists, meanwhile, estimated the strike has cost the
Caribbean island as much as dlrs 300 million.
	   The telephone company said it had lost dlrs 10.1 million in
damage caused by saboteurs who slashed telephone cables and left
more than a quarter-million islanders without long-distance service
this week.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak flew to
Libya on Thursday to see Col. Moammar Gadhafi on a trip for which
he had permission to override a U.N. air embargo.
	   Mubarak was accompanied by several ministers, aides and a
medical team on the flight, which Egyptian officials said was to
check on Gadhafi's health.
	   Libyan state-run television showed Mubarak greeting Gadhafi who
sat in a wheel chair. Gadhafi had an operation Monday on his hip
which he broke while exercising.
	   It was the first time the U.N. sanctions committee had given
approval for such a flight _ waivers are generally made for
humanitarian purposes only, U.N. officials said.
	   In a letter, however, the sanctions committee took note of the
fact that Mubarak would be visiting Gadhafi with a medical team.
	   Egypt requested and got approval Wednesday afternoon from the
U.N. sanctions committee for the flight. Chad and Niger, however,
did not request and did not have such approval, U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard said.

Lebanon accuses 18 ex-Christian militiamen of bombings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ A prosecutor accused 18 former members of
a Christian militia Thursday of trying to destabilize the country
through a bombing campaign, the state-run news agency reported.
	   Prosecutor Nasri Lahoud also accused the ex-members of the
right-wing Lebanese Forces of trying to get arms from Israel, a
crime punishable by death in Lebanon, which is technically at war
with the Jewish state.
	   Eleven of the 18 accused were handed over to the prosecutor
Thursday by the Lebanese army's intelligence department. The other
seven accused are still at large, the National News Agency
reported.
	   No date has been set for their trial, but it is expected to take
place in a military court owing to its state security nature.
	   In his indictment, Lahoud charged the 18 with forming ``a gang
with the aim of attacking people and properties and attempting to
carry out terrorist acts with bombs and inflammable material.''
	   He also accused the 18 of planning to assassinate two cabinet
ministers.
	   Lahoud did not name the ministers, but the National News Agency
said last week that the group had targeted Interior Minister Michel
Murr and Minister of Electricity and Hydraulic Resources Elias
Hobeika.
	   The indictment said the 18 were behind a bus bombing in
Damascus, Syria, in 1996 that killed 11 people; a 1996 attack on a
Syrian bus in Lebanon that killed its driver; and an explosion at
the main Beirut bus terminal in October 1997 that caused no
casualties.
	   It said that two members of the group were killed in Beirut on
June 12 when one of their bombs exploded prematurely.
	   The main Christian militia during the 1975-90 civil war, the
Lebanese Forces was disbanded by the government in 1994. During the
war, the LF opposed Syrian influence in Lebanon and had close ties
to Israel.
	   Syria today maintains about 30,000 soldiers in Lebanon and is
the main power broker in the country.
	   The charges against the 18 came a day after Lahoud accused 77
people of spying for Israel by providing information on Lebanese
and Syrian troop movements and Lebanese guerrillas.

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch officials have asked
Trinidad and Tobago to arrest and extradite Suriname's former
dictator Desi Bouterse, but the Caribbean country has refused, an
official said Thursday.
	   Prosecutors in The Hague have charged Bouterse with cocaine
smuggling, claiming he transported hundreds of kilograms (pounds)
of cocaine to Europe, said Elizabeth Horstink, a spokeswoman for
the prosecutor's office.
	   Bouterse has denied the charges, and Suriname refuses to
extradite him to the Netherlands for trial.
	   Trinidad and Tobago also refused the extradition request.
	   ``The government of Trinidad and Tobago is not in a position to
respond to this request because there is no bilateral legal
mechanism to allow Trinidad and Tobago to respond,'' Foreign
Minister Ralph Maraj told The Associated Press.
	   A Trinidadian police source confirmed that Bouterse had arrived
on the Caribbean island a couple of days ago and was staying with
his country's consul general in Port-of-Spain. The source, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, said Bouterse was supposed to
leave Trinidad later Thursday.

Mexican government peace move called disappointing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo MO101 &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN RICE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Nearly five months after Zapatista rebel
leaders vanished from view, the government's plan to lure them back
to peace talks met a chilly response Thursday.
	   Members of a congressional peace commission expressed
disappointment, Zapatista supporters dismissed the plan outright
and, as become customary, Subcomandante Marcos, the rebel leader,
was silent.
	   The Interior Secretariat on Wednesday promised actions to relax
political tensions in the southernmost state of Chiapas and urged
the Zapatista National Liberation Army to resume talks to end the 4
1/2-year-old rebellion.
	   Negotiations collapsed in late 1996, leading to more than a year
of squabbling between the government and leftist rebels over who
was to blame.
	   But the masked, pipe-puffing Marcos _ a normally effusive sort
whose collected communiques and playful parables fill three books _
has not been seen publicly since a videotaped statement in
February.
	   That silence has cast greater uncertainty over peace efforts.
Marcos did not even comment when troops and police raided several
pro-Zapatista villages and clashed with Zapatista fighters in
recent months.
	   He repeatedly has ignored efforts by government and independent
peace mediators to meet him.
	   The silence seems more ominous because it follows a Dec. 22
massacre of Zapatista sympathizers by a vigilante group who
officials say received help from police and military figures.
	   Rumors that Marcos was dead or sick, disgraced or abroad, or
perhaps preparing a new offensive, have seen not a hint of
confirmation.
	   The government said Tuesday it would free Zapatista prisoners
accused of nonviolent crimes and might recognize now-illegal
pro-rebel townships as part of a state proposal to redraw municipal
boundaries.
	   It asked rebels to turn in weapons and to avoid setting up new
townships.
	   The measures stopped short of those suggested by a congressional
committee trying to draw the two sides back to talks.
	   ``I think this proposal lacks the fresh breath we hoped for....
or the transcendence that the moment demands,'' said Congressman
Felipe de Jesus Vicencio, spokesman for the commission.
	   He complained that it failed to suggest a pullback of federal
troops and was confusing about which actions the government would
take before hearing from the Zapatistas.
	   Vicencio also said it was unclear if most Zapatista prisoners
might be released. Dozens were arrested in recent raids on
pro-rebel villages. But the government has insisted their rebel
affiliation had nothing to do with the arrests.
	   With the Zapatistas themselves still mute, their supporters
spoke up.
	   ``There is nothing new. (The government) remains in the logic of
war,'' said Ana Maria Aragones, a former Zapatista adviser and now
member of the Citizens Network of Aid for the Zapatista Cause.
	   She told a news conference Marcos had been silent because the
government has ignored Zapatista conditions for talks.
	   ``He has said what he has to say and if (the government) still
fails to comply, what is he going to say?''
	   The Zapatistas demand an army pullback, release of prisoners,
acceptance of their townships and enactment of an Indian rights
bill drafted by the congressional peace committee. It is based on
the only pact so far in the peace talks.
	   The government insists it accepts the agreement with the rebels,
but the Zapatistas reject the government proposal for enacting it.

Amnesty: 11 prisoners on death row for treason in Equatorial Guinea
</HEADLINE>
are starving &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Eleven political prisoners sentenced to
death for treason in Equatorial Guinea could die of starvation in
their cells, Amnesty International reported Thursday.
	   ``Unless something is done to improve their situation
immediately, executions will not be necessary to kill many of
them,'' the group warned in a statement.
	   The human rights group said the prisoners were suffering from
dehydration and hunger.
	   A military court in the former Spanish colony of 400,000
inhabitants sentenced the 11 on June 1 at the end of a mass treason
trial of more than 110 people. The court sentenced four other
people, tried in absentia, to death. Another 70 people were
sentenced to jail terms.
	   The exact numbers of those tried and convicted were unavailable.
	   Amnesty said the trial and convictions appeared to be motivated
by the desire to crack down on groups representing the ethnic Bubi
minority in the tiny west African country.
	   Although President Teodoro Obiang suspended the executions, due
to take place by firing squad, he has yet to bow to international
pressure to commute the death sentences to jail terms, the Amnesty
statement said.
	   ``All the convictions were based on confessions extracted under
torture'' Amnesty's statement said.
	   The charges stemmed from an attack in January on a military
barracks on the Equatorial Guinean island of Bioko _ the home of
most of the ethnic Bubi.
	   Many of the condemned belong to the Bioko Autonomy Movement, an
outlawed political group that strongly opposes Obiang.
	   Some 500 people, mostly Bubi, were arrested in the military
crackdown that followed the January attack, which left four
soldiers and one civilian dead.
	   Amnesty's statement said that at least six people died during
pretrial detention and many of those convicted were still weak from
the torture they received.
	   Amnesty, along with several European countries and the United
States, has long accused Obiang's government of human rights
violations.
	   Obiang seized power in the oil-rich country wedged between
Cameroon and Gabon in 1979 by overthrowing his uncle Francisco
Macias Nguema.

Former Salvadoran guardsman blames officers in American nuns'
</HEADLINE>
killing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   QUEZALTEPEQUE, El Salvador (AP) _ A former national guardsman,
now serving prison time, claimed Thursday that he and four other
guardsmen were acting under orders when they killed four American
church workers in 1980.
	   ``We are in prison for a crime that was not motivated by us. We
were just following orders,'' Carlos Joaquin Contreras Palacios
told The Associated Press in an interview in Quezaltepeque.
	   He refused to say who gave the orders.
	   The other guardsmen have made similar claims in the past.
	   The five guardsmen were convicted of kidnapping, raping and
killing Roman Catholic nuns Ita Ford, Dorothy Kazel and Maura Clark
and layworker Jean Donovan on Dec. 2, 1980. Military-backed death
squads had suspected the nuns of sympathizing with leftist
guerrillas.
	   Judge Gloria Platero ruled on June 24 that three of the
guardsmen, sentenced to 30 years in prison, were entitled to an
early release under a new law intended to ease prison overcrowding.
The other two did not qualify for release because one had
previously been convicted on weapons charges and the other had
participated in a prison disturbance.
	   On July 2, she rejected a motion filed by prosecutors seeking to
block the release of former guardsmen Luis Colindres, Jose Roberto
Moreno and Daniel Canales. She also rejected a motion from defense
attorneys arguing the other two guardsmen, Orlando Contreras and
Contreras Palacios, should be freed.
	   Both sides have until next week to file appeals to a panel of
magistrates, which would make the final decision.
	   The national guard was disbanded after a 1992 peace agreement
ended the civil war, which killed an estimated 75,000 people.

Annan says India, Pakistan close to talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. chief said Thursday that Pakistan
and India appeared ready to hold talks on security and other issues
_ including Kashmir _ by the end of July and that he himself might
visit the region.
	   In a letter to the Security Council, Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said he was encouraged by indications from leaders of both
countries and would continue efforts to bring the two sides
together to discuss nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament.
	   A meeting between the two heads of state during a South Asian
regional meeting in Colombo, Sri Lanka at the end of July is likely
to materialize, Annan wrote.
	   Tensions between the south Asian neighbors escalated after India
detonated five underground nuclear explosions in early May.
Pakistan responded with six tests, heightening tensions between the
rivals who have fought three wars in the last 50 years.
	   Two of the wars have been over India-controlled Kashmir, where
Muslim rebels have been fighting a separatist war since 1989. India
has two-thirds of the northern territory and Pakistan the rest,
while both claim all of Kashmir.
	   Annan's letter was circulated to council members Thursday as his
envoy, Alvaro de Soto, briefed the council on his recent trip to
Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. He canceled a visit to India
after New Delhi said he was not welcome.
	   ``Mr. de Soto's contacts with regional leaders, while not as
complete as would have been desirable, nevertheless confirmed my
concern that the new situation which had emerged following the
developments of May, compounding as it does the longstanding causes
of friction between India and Pakistan, may have serious
implications for peace and security in the region and beyond,''
Annan wrote.
	   ``In this connection, I have been encouraged by indications from
both sides of their readiness to enter into a dialogue addressing
peace and security matters and causes of tension, including
Kashmir,'' he wrote.
	   India has flatly rejected international mediation over the
Kashmir dispute. Pakistan has urged the United Nations and others
to step in.
	   De Soto delivered letters with Annan's offer to visit the region
``at the appropriate time,'' to Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.

Italians do well in rain-interrupted claycourt classic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASTAD, Sweden (AP) _ Andrea Gaudenzi of Italy moved into the
quarter finals in the Swedish Open claycourt classic by ousting
Juan Antonio Marin of Costa Rica 6-2, 7-5 Thursday.
	   Third-seeded Gaudenzi*s less merited countryman Davide
Sanguinetti was battling 6th-seeded Swede Tomas Johansson for a
spot in the quarters when play was interrupted by increasing
showers. Johansson narrowly led Sanguinetti, who earlier upset
Sweden*s Mikael Tillstrom, 6-7 (5-7), 6-3, 2-1, when the match was
stopped or the day.
	   Gaudenzi after some rest also teamed with fellow-countryman
Diego Nargiso to advance into the quarters of the doubles.
	   In other pre-rain action Moroccan Karim Alami advanced into the
quarters after a tough see-saw fight against spanish qualifier
Fernando Vicente, 1-6, 7-6 (7-3), 6-4.
	   Australian Richard Fromberg from Tasmania, who won the title at
Bastad eight years ago, led 6-5 in the first set against Andrei
Medvedev when rain interrupted all play. The two incomplete matches
will be played Friday before quarter finals play is set to start
	   If Tomas Johansson is upset by Sanguinetti seven out of eight
Swedish players will be out and the remaining hope pinned on
top-seed Magnus Gustafsson, who is chasing his fourth Swedish Open
title. He lost a set Wednesday to Austrian qualifyer Markus Hipfl.
	   In the quarters scheduled to start around noon Friday on the
often windy seaside centercourt Gustafsson will be heavily favored
against Jerome Golmard, a 24-year old Frenchman from Dijon with no
titles and a lowly 75th ranking on the ATP list.
	   If Gustafsson, who won here in 1991, 1992 and 1996 and has a
total of 11 titles, pulls through all the way he will not only
improve his current 26th ATP ranking but also be one up on fellow
Swedes Bjorn Borg and Mats Wilander, the only other players with
three titles.
	   Two other seeeds were eliminated in Wednesdays action. The
defending champion, second-seed Magnus Norman of Sweden, joined
fourth-seed Magnus Larsson who exited Tuesday when he lost on the
home turf to unheralded Spaniard Fernando Vicente.

President-elect met with top rebel leader

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ In a dramatic announcement heightening
expectations of an end to Colombia's 34-year civil war,
President-elect Andres Pastrana said he met Thursday with the
leader of Colombia's oldest and most powerful leftist rebel group.
	   ``I want to announce to the country and the international
community that today I met in a location on Colombian territory
with Manuel Marulanda y Jorge Briceno,'' Pastrana said.
	   Marulanda is a top leader and a ranking military commander of
the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.
	   Pastrana, who is set to take office in August, declined to
disclose the exact location o his meeting with Marulanda.
	   It was the first-ever meeting between an elected or sitting
president and rebel leaders on Colombian soil.
	   Pastrana showed a 45-second video in which he is seen in jeans
and a collared shirt embracing the camouflaged rebel leaders.
	   He said peace talks would begin during the first 90 days of his
government and _ conceding to a longstanding rebel demand _ would
be preceded by the withdrawal of army troops from five towns in
guerrilla-contested territory.
	   Pastrana vowed to seek a ``stable and lasting peace,'' and said
FARC leaders characterized the meeting as ``historic.''
	   The rebels could not be reached for comment.
	   News of the clandestine encounter comes before meetings
beginning Sunday in Germany between Colombian civic leaders and
representatives of the 5,000-member National Liberation Army,
Colombia's second-largest guerrilla group.
	   Those talks are meant to pave the way for direct negotiations
with Pastrana, but political analysts had warned against inflated
peace expectations, in part because the Germany meetings do not
include FARC.
	   The 15,000-member FARC, which increasingly finances its
operations by protecting cocaine trafficking in the southern
coca-growing regions, has scored military victories over the past
two years against an ill-equipped and dispirited 120,000-member
army.
	   FARC refused to negotiate with outgoing President Ernesto
Samper, calling his government illegitimate due to allegations
Samper's campaign received millions of dollars from drug
traffickers.
	   Rebels have previously said they will only talk peace if the
government dismantles right-wing paramilitary groups who have
committed dozens of massacres of civilians suspected of supporting
the rebels.

Canada-Alaska salmon talks collapse
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) _ Talks aimed at reaching a
salmon-sharing deal between Canada and Alaska for this fishing
season have collapsed, Canadian Fisheries Minister David Anderson
said Thursday.
	   Anderson said the two sides could not agree on the most
important issue _ conservation and protection of coho salmon that
swim through Alaskan and British Columbian waters.
	   He said Canada is now calling for an independent expert to
review the status of Pacific coho stocks, which Canada believes are
threatened.
	   Canada and Alaska were trying to reach interim fishing
arrangements for 1998 in the absence of a long-term arrangements
under the U.S.-Canada Pacific Salmon Treaty. Talks to renew the
treaty have been stalled since 1994.
	   Canada earlier announced agreements with Washington state to
conserve coho in waters they share. That deal allowed Washington to
take Canadian-bound chinook salmon and one quarter of the lucrative
Fraser River sockeye run.
	   The extent of the disagreement with Alaska was evident Thursday
in contradictory descriptions of coho populations by Canadian and
U.S. officials.
	   Pat Chamut, the Canadian Fisheries Department's assistant deputy
minister, said coho in upper Skeena River region ``are at
significant risk'' and without some type of conservation agreement,
they ``could become extinct.''
	   But Alaska's analysis of its own and Canada's data ``doesn't
indicate that coho are endangered,'' said Phil Doherty, manager of
the Fish and Game Department for southeast Alaska.
	   Canada and Alaska agree the 1997 coho fishery was poor. Canada,
however, sees it as a long-term problem, whereas Alaska wants to
assess the state of the 1998 coho fishery before deciding on
conservation measures.
	   ``If 1998 is similar, we'll take conservation steps,'' said
Doherty.
	   Last summer, British Columbia fishermen angered by what they
perceived as Alaskan overfishing blocked an Alaskan ferry in the
harbor at Prince Rupert, British Columbia.
	   Fisherman's union president John Radosevic refused to say
Thursday whether fishermen would consider retaliatory action again
this year. An out-of-court settlement of an Alaskan lawsuit over
the 1997 blockade forbids them from interfering with the ferry.
	   British Columbia Premier Glen Clark has condemned the deal with
Washington state as a sellout. He has agreed with fishermen in his
province who complain that Americans will be free to fish Canadian
stocks while the Canadians face harsh fishing restrictions imposed
by Anderson to protect coho.
	   Fishing in Canadian waters has been banned from several areas to
rule out any accidental coho catches, while on other parts of the
coast, boats must use fishing techniques that minimize coho
mortality if they're accidentally caught.

Gunmen fire on U.N. helicopter during Angola mission
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Unidentified gunmen shot at a United
Nations helicopter as it prepared to land at a rural village, the
U.N mission overseeing Angola's peace process said Thursday.
	   No one was hurt in the Tuesday incident that underlined the
growing insecurity in remote areas where thousands of demobilized
soldiers have rejoined civilian life.
	   Their reintegration has been made difficult by the failure to
fully implement the 1994 peace pact between the government and
UNITA rebels, hindering economic development.
	   In a separate incident, gunmen ambushed a vehicle in Malanje
province 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of Luanda on Wednesday,
killing 19 people, Angolan state radio reported Thursday.
	   Also, 16 policemen were killed in an ambush on Monday in Lunda
Norte province, 500 kilometers (310 miles) northeast of Luanda,
according to police.
	   There was no independent verification of the reports.
	   The U.N. helicopter came under small arms fire from a group of
about 15 men as it approached Toto in Uige province, about 300
kilometers (186 miles) north of Luanda, the United Nations said in
a statement.
	   The aircraft, carrying U.N. staff as well as representatives of
the government and UNITA, was hit by five rounds, forcing the
helicopter to flee the area.
	   Since March, two U.N. helicopters have come under fire from
unidentified gunmen, two U.N. monitoring sites have been attacked
and U.N. personnel have been assaulted, the statement said.
	   Humanitarian aid has been halted in nine of the vast southwest
African nation's 18 provinces because of concern about security.
	   The United Nations called on the government and UNITA to
collaborate in identifying the gunmen.
	   The government has blamed the former rebels for the attacks,
saying UNITA wants to undermine the peace accord that ended a
two-decade civil war.
	   UNITA denies the charges.

Nigerian junta commutes sentences while police battle protesters

 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with junta announcement on alleged
coup plotters, transition. TRIMS. No pickup. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria _ Nigeria's ruling junta commuted the death
sentence against a former deputy leader Thursday while police
fought rioters as unrest flared anew over the death of the
country's most prominent political prisoner.
	   Late Thursday night the Provisional Ruling Council, the core of
the country's junta, announced that death sentences handed down
earlier this year against Gen. Oladipyo Diya and five other men for
plotting an alleged coup would be reduced.
	   Diya and two of his alleged co-conspirators now face 25 years in
prison, while three others sentenced to death face 20 years. The
various jail terms of nine other conspirators were also reduced.
	   A statement released by the junta said ``this gesture of
goodwill is to facilitate the ongoing reconciliation process in the
country'' and in answer to numerous pleas for mercy.
	   The junta also announced it would set up a commission of top
officials to sketch out the broad outline of a transition to
democracy, and that the country's new military ruler, Gen.
Abdulsalam Abubakar, would address the nation on the plan next
week.
	   In the streets of Nigeria, though, there was little thought of
reconciliation.
	   Fires lit in anger burned through parts of a popular central
market in Lagos; homes there and in the southwestern city of
Abeokuta were gutted by arsonist's fires.
	   There were no immediate reports of injuries in the fighting or
from the fires, but the bodies of at least 24 victims from violence
Wednesday have been either spotted or collected.
	   Police say the Lagos fires were set by youths enraged at the
death earlier this week of Moshood Abiola, the imprisoned
businessman who was the apparent winner of 1993's annulled
presidential elections.
	   The government says he died of a heart attack but his backers _
particularly across Nigeria's southwest where his support was the
strongest _ believe he was killed by the junta.
	   Many members of Abiola's family have also said they believed he
was killed.
	   The government says it has already completed an autopsy, but has
not yet released the results. A second independent autopsy to be
conducted by a team of visiting foreign pathologists was scheduled
for Friday.
	   On Thursday, hundreds of angry students were gathered outside
Abiola's home in the Lagos neighborhood of Ikeja, watched over by a
large detachment of riot police.
	   Abiola's son Kola angered the crowd, who accused him of siding
with the junta, after he waded through them saying ``My father was
a man of peace.''
	   Tempers were cooled after he re-emerged from the house to appeal
for calm.
	   ``This is the time for common sense so we can actualize the
ideals for which my father lived and died,'' he said.
	   Nigeria was in the midst of a flawed transition to democracy
program when the country's former dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, died
early last month. His successor, Abubakar, has vowed to move the
country to democracy, but he has said nothing about how it will be
completed.
	   The junta had been expected to discuss the sentences against
Diya and his alleged conspirators, who were accused of plotting to
overthrow Abacha last December. Diya, Abacha's former right-hand
man and the alleged mastermind, claimed he was framed.
	   Fifteen of the 30 people accused were acquitted when the
verdicts were handed down in May. With Thursday's commutations, the
15 people still facing prison terms will serve anywhere from two
years to 25 years.
	   While Lagos woke up Thursday to calm streets, the situation
quickly deteriorated. Four houses were burned in Abiola's hometown
of Abeokuta, where at least ten people died in Wednesday rioting. A
dusk-to-dawn curfew did not stop demonstrators from pouring into
the streets again Thursday, where they clashed with police firing
tear gas.
	   Police say 75 people have been arrested in Abeokuta, about 70
kilometers (45 miles) north of Lagos.
	   Firefighters and police in Lagos battled a blaze that started
mid-morning in several stalls in a central market. Several houses
reportedly were also set alight by marauding groups of youths, who
police were trying to control with tear gas.
	   In a number of Lagos neighborhoods, Yorubas from Nigeria's
southwest were battling Hausas from the north of the country using
knives, clubs and bows and arrows, witnesses said.
	   In one area, Yorubas accused Hausas of celebrating Abiola's
death. Hausas and Fulanis, both ethnic groups from the north, make
up a majority in the military and the junta, while much of
Nigeria's pro-democracy leadership, including Abiola, is Yoruba.
	   Brief skirmishes between police and demonstrators also broke out
in the southwestern city of Ile-Ife, where the university has been
shut down.
	   The city of Ibadan, where at least five people were killed
Wednesday, was also reportedly the scene of renewed clashes.
	   Abiola had been in prison since 1994, but many hoped would
emerge from jail to fulfill his 1993 electoral mandate. He died
Tuesday after suddenly falling ill during a meeting with U.S.
diplomats. He was 60.

Scores plummet in first round; Pak seven back

	   SYLVANIA, Ohio (AP) _ Vickie Odegard lipped out a 6-foot
(1.8-meter) birdie putt on the final green Thursday, costing her a
course record and the outright lead in the opening round of the
Jamie Farr Kroger Classic.
	   Odegard's tap-in par left her with a 7-under-par 64 and a tie
for the top spot with Dana Dormann, who had earlier matched the
competitive record at Highland Meadows Golf Club.
	   The 64s matched the low score on a par-71 course this year.
Neither of the co-leaders had a bogey.
	   Se Ri Pak shot an even-par 71 just three days after winning the
U.S. Open in a playoff.
	   Defending tournament champion Kelly Robbins, who set records
with an eight-stroke victory margin and a 19-under score, picked up
where she left off with a 69. But 30 players had lower scores.
	   A week ago, only 10 of 150 players broke par in the first round
of the U.S. Open at Blackwolf Run Golf Course. But 62 were under
par in the Farr, including the lone amateur in the field, Grace
Park. Eighty players were at par or better.
	   Eight holes played under par, including the 132-yard
(120-meter), par-3 eighth hole which yielded 39 birdies against
only six bogeys.
	   The 1993 Farr winner, Brandie Burton, was two shots back after a
66, along with former Ohio State player Meg Mallon.
	   At 4-under 67 were Karrie Webb, Hall of Famer Betsy King, Leta
Lindley, Laura Baugh, Kris Tschetter, Charlotta Sorenstam, Smriti
Mehra and Maria Hjorth.
	   Odegard, whose best career finish was fourth here as a rookie a
year ago, made the turn in 5-under. After two more birdies, she hit
her approach to the par-4 ninth hole _ her closing hole _ to six
feet. But she missed the putt that would have bettered the 64s
posted by five others, including Robbins in the second round last
year.
	   Dormann, winless since her second tour victory in 1993, was
1-under through five holes before stringing together four straight
birdies. Included in the streak was a 40-foot (12-meter) birdie
putt on the 16th green.
	   Dormann lost in a playoff to Wendy Ward in the Hawaiian Open in
February, then two weeks later at Tucson bogeyed the last hole to
miss a playoff with Helen Alfredsson by a shot.
	   None of the previous 13 Farr winners has shot lower than 67 in
the opening round. The 1987 winner, Jane Geddes, had a 70, as did
the only two-time winner, Penny Hammel (1985, '89).
	   The top three tour money-winners _ Liselotte Neumann, Donna
Andrews and Annika Sorenstam _ skipped the Farr, but the 144-player
field still includes the rest of the top 10 and 24 of the top 30.
	   The winner collects a dlrs 120,000 paycheck from a purse of dlrs
800,000.

Iraq accuses Kuwait of selling its tankers; asks UN to intervene
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq has accused Kuwait of selling five
Iraqi oil tankers it had been holding as scrap for dlrs 16.5
million and has urged the U.N. chief to intervene.
	   Baghdad didn't name the buyers, but said it was prepared to take
legal action against them and reserved the right to seek
compensation from Kuwait for any damage done to the tankers.
	   There was no reaction Thursday evening from Kuwait's U.N.
mission, which was closed for the night.
	   The accusation was contained in a letter from Iraqi Foreign
Minister Mohammed Said al-Sahaf to Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   ``As it protests against this illicit act, the government of
Iraq urges you to intervene at once with the Kuwaiti authorities in
oder to induce them to void the illegal sale and request them to
return the tankers to the Iraqi authorities,'' al-Sahaf wrote.
	   The tankers were registered in international shipping records as
belonging to the Iraqi Oil Tanker Company, he said. ``Any
conveyance of the tankers by the Kuwaiti authorities is therefore
illicit and has no legal basis.''
	   He said Kuwait had been holding the five tankers since 1991.
Four were in good condition _ the Al-Muthanna, Al-Qadisiyah, Hittin
and Tariq ibn Ziyad _ and one, the Al-Faw, was damaged, he said.
	   Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, touching off the Gulf War that
eventually drove Baghdad's forces from the oil-rich state.

Sore hip and all, Nicklaus can still play
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HARRY ATKINS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DEARBORN, Michigan (AP) _ Jack Nicklaus was more than just a
sentimental favorite.
	   Nicklaus, whose streak of 154 majors will end when he skips the
British Open next week, shot a 5-under-par 67 in the first round of
the Senior Players Championship on Thursday and was just one stroke
off the lead.
	   The leaders were Hale Irwin and John Jacobs with 66s at the TPC
of Michigan, a course Nicklaus designed. Nicklaus, who birdied the
final two holes, was tied with Bob Murphy and Terry Dill.
	   ``I walked around and I didn't hurt a step,'' said Nicklaus, who
is considering surgery for his arthritic left hip. ``Can I take
back what I said yesterday (about breaking the streak)?''
	   Nicklaus got off to a shaky start with two bogeys in the first
eight holes and was just 1-under at the turn. But he was once again
the Golden Bear as he charged around the back nine.
	   Putting with a confidence of old, the 58-year-old winner of 18
majors and two U.S. Amateur titles stroked in a putt for birdie at
No. 11 and another at the 12th to go 3-under.
	   It stayed that way until the par-5 17th where he carried a
2-iron over a long pond to the edge of the green, 60 feet (18
meters) from the hole. Nicklaus got down in two for birdie and
followed with a tricky 12-footer (3.6 meters) for birdie on the
finishing hole.
	   ``I always love to have a round where I can complain and still
shoot 5-under,'' Nicklaus said with a contented smile. ``That means
I missed a few putts, but obviously I had to make something.
	   ``What I like is I gave myself a lot of chances by playing some
good golf.''
	   Jacobs, who claimed his first pro victory with a one-stroke
victory over Irwin in the Nationwide Championship in June, birdied
the 16th and 17th, then got up and down to save par from in front
of No. 18.
	   ``It's kind of fun to be in a tournament when Jack's playing
well,'' Jacobs said. ``You know you're in a tournament when Jack's
playing like he is.''
	   Irwin, the leading money-winner after three victories this
season, took advantage of almost perfect playing conditions for a
bogey-free round. Still, his round featuring two sides of 33
included some close calls. Irwin needed a 15-footer (4.5 meters) to
save par at No. 14 and rolled in an 8-foot (2.4-meter) putt after
missing the green at the par-3 15th.
	   ``I hit really good irons, except 14 and 15,'' Irwin said.
``I've been playing well, but I'm not overconfident with my game.''
	   Bob Murphy and Terry Dill were at 67, one stroke better than Bob
Duval, Jose Canizares and 1991 winner Jim Albus.
	   Dave Stockton, who won the tournament in 1992 and 1994, was tied
with Lee Trevino, Jim Colbert and several others at 69.
	   Murphy, seeking his first win of the season, was cruising
through a bogey-free round and was 7-under through 15 holes. But he
bogeyed two of the final three holes.
	   Murphy, 35th on the money list, conceded he hasn't been playing
very well. But that may be about to change for the ESPN broadcaster
who has won at least once a year since joining the senior tour in
1993.
	   ``I went home and took a lesson from Laurie Hammer, an old
college teammate,'' Murphy said. ``We found I was taking the
clubface back closed. Laurie helped me quite a bit.''
	   Playing conditions were almost perfect, with soft fairways and
greens holding mistakes to a minimum on the 6,876-yard
(6,257-meter) layout in the shadow of sponsor Ford Motor Co.'s
world headquarters.
	   That seemed to help Dill, who was leading at one point during
the final round of last week's State Farm Senior Classic. He
birdied the last two holes for a 67, the best round he's ever shot
at the TPC of Michigan.
	   ``They've let the fairway grass grow a little longer,'' Dill
said. ``Plus, they had a pretty good rain here a couple of days ago
which softened up the greens.
	   ``But, I'm playing some of the best golf of my life right now,
at 59 years old.''

JonBenet's parents portrayed as victims of `witch hunt'
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The parents of JonBenet Ramsey broke a 14-month
silence in a television documentary aired Thursday in Britain which
portrayed them as victims of a media ``witch hunt.''
	   ``I don't know what happened,'' Patsy Ramsey said of her
daughter's death in the Channel 4 documentary. ``God knows, and
He's not telling.''
	   JonBenet, 6, was found beaten and strangled Dec. 26, 1996 in her
home in Boulder, Colorado. There have been no arrests, and
authorities have said only that Patsy and John Ramsey are under
suspicion. JonBenet, a former Little Miss Colorado, has become a
household name in the United States because of the unsolved
killing.
	   The program said the Ramseys were victims of leaked information
from police designed to pressure them into admitting guilt. Much of
the information was easily disproved, the program said, ``but for
virtually all the American media this case is closed ... guilty or
not they (the Ramseys) are the victims of a modern day witch
hunt.''
	   The program also quoted two doctors saying that there was no
evidence that JonBenet had been sexually abused.
	   ``I saw absolutely no signs of sexual abuse. I had no suspicion
of it. I always think about sexual abuse with any child, boy or
girl, who comes through this practice, because it is such a
terribly destructive thing ... in JonBenet's case I saw absolutely
no evidence,'' pediatrician Francesco Beuf said. Beuf saw JonBenet
27 times over four years for minor ailments or general checks, the
program said.
	   John Ramsey said he lost confidence in the police when he
discovered they wanted to withhold his daughter's body for burial
in order to force an interrogation.
	   ``It changed the whole chemistry on how we viewed the police,''
Ramsey said. ``They were not there to help us, they were there to
hang us.''
	   Mr. Ramsey denied allegations that he bought pornography and
that he had abused his other children, a view supported by
interviews with the adult children of his first marriage and his
first wife, Lucinda Ramsey-Johnson.
	   John Ramsey ``is affectionate, he is kind and very gentle,''
said Ramsey-Johnson.
	   ``He has never ever raised a hand to any of his children. He has
never ever abused us in any way,'' said Ramsey's elder daughter
Melinda.
	   The program also quoted from Boulder social services, who
concluded that JonBenet's brother, Burke, had not been physically
or sexually abused either. Police watched the interview between
social workers and the then nine-year-old behind a two-way mirror.
	   Both Ramseys fiercely deny any involvement in the death of their
daughter.
	   ``The American public has been led to believe that, after a
wonderful Christmas, we brutally beat JonBenet, sexually molested
her, strangled her, went to sleep, got up the next morning, wrote a
ransom note, called the police, sat around the house for four
hours, then I went downstairs and discovered her body and was able
to act distraught,'' Mr. Ramsey said.
	   Police have been criticized for their handling of the case,
particularly for failing to secure the crime scene and allowing
John Ramsey to search the home and find JonBenet's body. He found
her about eight hours after Mrs. Ramsey said she found a ransom
note demanding $118,000.
	   The Ramseys have moved back to suburban Atlanta, where they
lived until 1991. JonBenet is buried near their new home.

Study disputes human's first use of fire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Peking Man may not have built campfires in his
caves after all, according to a new study.
	   Archaeologists have believed for more than 50 years that a cave
in Zhoudoudian, China, contained the evidence that humans learned
to control and use fire about 500,000 years ago, the era when Homo
erectus, also known as Peking Man, was the dominant hominid.
	   Now researchers analyzing sediments from the cave say the
specimens lack the telltale traces of wood ash needed to prove the
ancient human-like creatures used and controlled fire.
	   ``If fire was used at this location in the site, it is difficult
to account for the absence of ... wood ash,'' the researchers
reported in a study to be published Friday in the journal Science.
	   ``In a sense, we spoil the story,'' said Steve Weiner, a
biologist from the Weizmann Institute in Israel and the lead author
of the study.
	   The study, by scientists from Israel, China, Harvard and Boston
University, said sediments previously identified as remnants of a
campfire lacked some key chemical features of in-place burning.
Charred bones found at the site, they said, could have burned in a
natural fire and moved to the site by water, since the sediments
show evidence that they were once submerged.
	   Some stone tool chips _ called quartzite _ found in the site
also fail to prove that dwellers in the cave used fire, the study
says.
	   ``The co-occurence of burned black bones and quartzite artifacts
in the same layer is only suggestive of a cultural association, and
hence of the use of fire by humans, but does not prove it,'' the
study said.
	   Indeed, the researchers question if the site cave was used as a
home by humans at all. The cave was actually a depression in a
vertical fault that was open to the sky and would provide little
real shelter, Science reports.
	   If the new analysis is accepted, then archaeologists have no
strong evidence that humans used fire earlier than 300,000 years
ago, Science reports. This means that Homo erectus, the hominid
that is thought to have colonized Asia starting about 1.8 million
years ago, may have moved into colder latitudes without the benefit
of controlled fire.
	   ``We now have to reconsider Homo erectus, their migrations and
their capability,'' Huang Weiwen, a Chinese archaeologist, told
Science.

Gebrselassie misses 3,000 world record; Bubka no-heights
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with later events &QL;

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The cold weather spoiled red-hot Haile
Gebrselassie's attempt to break a third world record since early
June.
	   The Ethiopian, returning to the track where he slashed the world
10,000-meter record a year ago, missed the 3,000 mark by more than
six seconds Thursday at the Bislett Games.
	   ``Seven 20 is very fast,'' he said. ``It's a very good record. I
thought I could do it, but during the warm-up I felt it wasn't warm
enough for a new record.
	   ``The pacemakers were very good, but I got too tired to do the
work. So I slowed down to be sure I could win.''
	   Gebrselassie clocked 7 minutes, 27.42 seconds, the fastest time
of the year. A pair of Kenyans, Luke Kipkosgei and John Kibowen,
were second and third in 7:28.28 and 7:29.09.
	   Daniel Komen of Kenya set the record of 7:20.67 two years ago at
Rieti, Italy.
	   In his first two races this season, Gebrselassie shattered world
records at 10,000 meters (26:22.75) at Hengelo, Holland, and then
the 5,000 mark (12:39.36) in another Grand Prix meet at Helsinki,
Finland. He has set 14 world records and world bests during his
career.
	   Jonathan Edwards, the world-record holder from Britain, had
another seasonal best as he won the triple jump at 18.01 meters.
His world record from the 1995 World Championships is 18.29.
	   ``I'm chuffed to bits about it,'' he said. ``In 1995, it was so
easy. Ever since then I'd been chasing after it and I hadn't
expected it here in the least. I'm in great shape, but I felt 18
(meters) might be possible in about five week's time.''
	   Edwards jump was the fourth longest all-time and the best in the
world for two years.
	   For Sergei Bubka, the miseries continued in a stadium where the
great Ukrainian pole vaulter often had problems in the past.
	   Bubka, who has broken more world records (17 outdoors and 18
indoors) than any other athlete, failed to clear his opening height
at 5.60 meters.
	   ``My only comment today is 'no comment,'' said Bubka before
leaving the stadium through the back entrance, which was unlocked
on his request.
	   The 34-year-old Bubka, the only track and field athlete to win
six straight world championship gold medals, set the world record
of 6.14 meters at Sestriere, Italy, in 1994.
	   This was his third meet of the outdoor season. He cleared 5.80
in the Doha Grand Prix in May and 5.72 in Athens last month.
	   Jeff Hartwig of the United States won the pole vault at 5.90
with 1996 Olympic champion Jean Galfione of France second at 5.80.
Hartwig cleared six meters last month in a meet at Saint-Denis,
France, and is the leading vaulter this summer.
	   Marion Jones of the United States led from the start and won the
women's 100 in 10.82, improving her Bislett Staduium record from
last year.
	   ``''The race was easy,'' she said. ``I felt very relaxed. That's
why it was a good time.''
	   Jones, ranked No. 1 in the world at 100, 200 and the long jump,
ran a seasonal best of 10.71 in China two months ago.
	   Frankie Fredericks, a two-time Olympic silver medalist from
Namibia, clocked 9.95 seconds in edging world champion Maurice
Greene of the United States by one-hundredth of a second in the
men's 100. It was the fourth fastest time of the year.
	   Frederick's winning time extended his record total of legal
sub-10-second marks to 21. Carl Lewis is second (15).
	   Greene, who also clocked a 9.96 during the U.S. Championships in
New Orleans last month, only made the final as the second loser in
the qualifying heats. He was third in heat one.
	   ``The best man won,'' Greene said. ``I can't complain about it.
I'm not going to make excuses. Frankie beat me.''
	   Bryan Robson, who set the third fastest time ever in the 400
hurdles in New Orleans, won his specialty in 47.94.
	   ``I'm happy to win and with the time,'' said Robson, who had a
47.03 in New Orleans. ``But I made two mistakes at two of the
hurdles.''
	   Cathy Freeman's two-year unbeaten streak at 400 meters ended as
the world champion from Australia only finished fourth in 50.92.
Charity Opara of Nigeria won the race in 50.13.
	   World champion Ato Bolden of Trinidad won the men's 200 in 20.23
and Mark Richardson of Britain took the 400 in 44.37 with Olympic
and world champion Michael Johnson of the United States only third
in 44.58.
	   The Bislett Games was the opening meet of the new Golden League,
which also counts toward the established Grand Prix competition and
offers dlrs one million for anyone who can win at all six meets
plus the final.
	   Others meets include Rome (July 14), Monte Carlo (August 8),
Zurich (August 12), Brussels (August 27), Berlin (September 2) with
the final set for Moscow September 5.
	   The selected events for men are the 100, 400, 1,500 meters,
either the 3,000, 5,000 or 10,000 meters, 400 hurdles, triple jump
and pole vault.
	   The selected events for women are the 100, 400, 1,500 meters,
the 100 hurdles and javelin.

Resolution condemning Israel still being worked on
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS comment at end from Israeli U.N. ambassador &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United States, which suffered a
diplomatic blow in the U.N. General Assembly earlier this week, is
trying to head off an Arab-sponsored resolution in the Security
Council that would condemn Israel for trying to expand Jerusalem.
	   U.S. and Arab representatives met Wednesday night to try to work
out a compromise, and proposals were being sent to Washington and
other capitals to see what leverage negotiators could offer,
diplomatic sources said Thursday.
	   Both sides were trying to find common ground on a presidential
statement, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Such a statement doesn't carry the weight of international law that
a resolution does.
	   No vote has been scheduled.
	   An Arab-sponsored draft resolution would condemn the June 21
decision by the Israeli cabinet and demand it be rescinded. The
decision called for the extension of Jerusalem's boundaries to
include several towns and the expansion of some municipal services
from Jerusalem to West Bank settlements.
	   Washington, which said it regretted the cabinet decision, has
nonetheless argued that a U.N. resolution would inflame passions
and hinder U.S. diplomatic efforts to revive the stalled Middle
East peace process.
	   The United States used the same argument unsuccessfully on
Tuesday when the General Assembly voted overwhelmingly to give more
rights and privileges to the Palestinian observer mission.
	   The assembly voted 124-4 to enhance the Palestinians' role to
that just short of a member state. Ten countries abstained.
	   U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson called the symbolic move ``the
wrong resolution at the wrong time.''
	   In Washington on Thursday, Israel's U.N. ambassador, Dore Gold,
repeated his insistence that the cabinet decision on Jerusalem was
a local municipal one that didn't affect the political status of
the city.
	   The Palestinians want Jerusalem as the capital of a future
state.
	   ``We are not altering the borders of Jerusalem and annexing
pre-1967 territory,'' he told a luncheon meeting of the Democratic
Leadership Council. He said that the only change in municipal
borders was into areas that have been under Israeli control prior
to the 1967 war.
	   The purpose, he said, was to acquire land for development. ``If
we don't do that, people will leave Jerusalem because the price of
real estate will go too high.''

Boston museum rejects Guatemalan request to return artifacts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ The Boston Museum of Fine Arts has refused a
formal request by Guatemala to return pre-Columbian artifacts that
the Guatemalan government believes were looted and then given to
the museum.
	   The 32 pieces, which include pottery, burial urns and figurines,
went on permanent display at the museum in December.
	   In a June 26 letter, museum director Malcolm Rogers told the
Guatemalan cultural minister that after a ``thorough examination of
applicable law, we have found no basis for concluding that the
Government of Guatemala has any claim to ownership of the
objects.''
	   Rogers, in an interview Thursday, said he now considered the
issue closed.
	   But the Guatemalan government disagrees.
	   Luisa Costanza, of the Guatemalan Embassy in Washington, D.C.,
told The Associated Press that the government was hoping to resolve
the issue outside the courts, but might sue the museum if the
pieces aren't recovered.
	   ``The minister of culture is working to research what other
things Guatemala can do to have these pieces to go back to
Guatemala,'' Costanza said. ``If that means doing it legally via a
lawsuit we would consider it.''
	   The museum has come under fire in recent months for displaying
artifacts from both Mali and Guatemala that officials from those
countries believe were looted and exported illegally. Mexican
officials have also said that they are investigating whether the
museum has items that may have been taken from Mexico illegally.
	   The Mayan artifacts were given to the museum by Landon T. Clay,
a museum trustee.
	   Museum spokeswoman Kelly Gifford said all the objects the
Guatemalan government has claimed were brought into the United
States between 1974 and 1981, long after Guatemala passed a law in
1947 banning the export of pre-Columbian artifacts.
	   But museum officials said the pieces were imported before the
United States signed on to an international agreement not to import
such artifacts.
	   Rogers would not say whether the museum had considered
Guatemalan law when it concluded the Guatemalan government had no
legitimate claim to artifacts.
	   Carlos Enrique Zea Flores, Guatemala's vice minister for
culture, said he does not consider the museum to be reputable
because ``it does not respect the cultural heritage of our country
or our laws against looting.''
	   ``We cannot call them a museum because that is a term of
honor,'' he told The Boston Globe. ``Their collectors buy looted
pieces, and then they accept them. A real museum with ethics would
not accept looted goods,'' he said.

Tyson can apply for a boxing license, but he'll have to do it
</HEADLINE>
personally &QL; 
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ If Mike Tyson wants to fight again, he's going
to have to pick up a telephone and let Nevada boxing officials know
his intentions.
	   On the first day Tyson could formally ask to return to the sport
he once dominated, Nevada officials made it clear Thursday they
want to hear from Tyson personally before setting a hearing on his
request for a new boxing license.
	   ``I want to hear from Mike directly,'' said Marc Ratner,
executive director of the Nevada Athletic Commission. ``I will need
to talk to him before we do anything.''
	   A year after Tyson's license was revoked and he was fined dlrs 3
million for biting Evander Holyfield's ears, the former heavyweight
champion became eligible Thursday to apply for a new license that
would allow him to return to the ring.
	   No such request had been made to the commission by midday,
however, and both Ratner and members of the commission say it will
have to come from Tyson himself. That's because, they don't know
who is representing Tyson.
	   ``Every time we turn around we have another person representing
him or meeting with him,'' said Dr. James Nave, a commission
member. ``As far as I know, nobody has given us anything in writing
to indicate they are representing him.''
	   In the year since his license was revoked, Tyson split from
promoter Don King and his former co-managers, Rory Holloway and
John Horne, claiming they took millions of dollars from him that
were rightfully his.
	   In February, Tyson aligned himself with Hollywood agents Jeff
Wald and Irving Azoff, but that relationship has since cooled.
Recently, fight manager Shelly Finkel said he represents the boxer.
	   Finkel said in June that Tyson would apply for a new license
this month, with hopes of a comeback fight in October or November.
	   Nave, who was influential in the decision to revoke Tyson's
license instead of suspending him from boxing for a set period of
time, said he and other commissioners have paid little attention to
the one-year anniversary of the license revocation.
	   ``I know people will find that hard to believe but we really
haven't talked about it,'' Nave said.
	   Nave said he remains comfortable with the decision the
commission made in the wake of the June 28, 1997, WBA heavyweight
title fight that ended when Tyson was disqualified in the third
round after biting a chunk out of Holyfield's right ear, then
biting his left ear.
	   ``My number one emotion at the time was sadness and it remains
so,'' Nave said. ``What a wonderful night that could have been for
the sport. Then, in a split second, it disappeared.''
	   Tyson, whose only venture into the ring since the biting was an
appearance at Wrestlemania in March that paid him dlrs 3.5 million,
reportedly has been training on the East Coast for an eventual
return to the sport.
	   If the commission grants him a license, he would be expected to
first have a tuneup fight such as he did when he fought Peter
McNeeley after being released from prison in 1995.
	   The biggest money fight for Tyson remains a rematch with
Holyfield, who has beaten him twice. Holyfield has not ruled out
such a fight, especially since he has been unable to come to terms
on a title unification fight with WBC champion Lennox Lewis.

	   Here is a summary of late news from The Associated Press.
Stories carried ``i'' or ``f'' category codes. Some of the items
below have moved on this circuit in expanded form:
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's ruling junta announced Thursday
that death sentences handed down earlier this year against Gen.
Oladipyo Diya and five other men for allegedly plotting a coup
would be commuted. The junta also announced it would set up a
commission of top officials to sketch out the broad outline for a
transition to democracy. It said the country's new military ruler,
Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, would address the nation on the plan next
week. Meanwhile riots and protests flared anew over the death of
the country's most prominent political prisoner. (Nigeria)
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ British Prime Minister Tony
Blair refused to reverse a ban on a controversial Protestant march,
while marchers and Catholic protesters held their ground Thursday
in a violent standoff. Blair told Orange Order leaders in London he
would let stand a Northern Ireland Parades Commission decision
blocking the Protestant brotherhood from marching down Garvaghy
Road through a hostile Catholic neighborhood in Portadown, 25 miles
(40 kilometers) southwest of Belfast. One Orange leader threatened
that Protestants could ``paralyze'' Northern Ireland unless its
march goes through. While others were more conciliatory and have
appealed for calm, the Orangemen still refused to talk directly to
their Catholic opponents. (Northern Ireland)
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ In a dramatic announcement heightening
expectations of an end to Colombia's 34-year civil war,
President-elect Andres Pastrana said he met Thursday with the
leader of Colombia's oldest and most powerful leftist rebel group.
His meeting with Manuel Marulanda and Jorge Briceno, two leaders of
the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, was the first-ever
meeting between an elected or sitting president and rebel leaders
on Colombian soil. Pastrana, who is set to take office in August,
declined to disclose the exact location of the meeting.
(Colombia-Rebel Meeting)
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. chief said Thursday that Pakistan
and India appeared ready to hold talks on security and other issues
_ including Kashmir _ by the end of July and that he himself might
visit the region. In a letter to the Security Council,
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he was encouraged by indications
from leaders of both countries and would continue efforts to bring
the two sides together to discuss nuclear nonproliferation and
disarmament. A meeting between the two heads of state during a
South Asian regional meeting in Colombo, Sri Lanka at the end of
July is likely to materialize, Annan wrote. Tensions between the
south Asian neighbors escalated after India detonated five
underground nuclear explosions in early May. Pakistan responded
with six tests. (UN-India-Pakistan)
	   JUNIK, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo's ethnic Albanian rebels held
their ground near the border with Albania on Thursday after two
days of attacks by Serb security forces. International observers
took advantage of the lull in fighting to tour flash points in the
province. In Vienna, Austria, the Organization of Security and
Cooperation in Europe said Yugoslavia had agreed to let an OSCE
delegation visit the country, including Kosovo, for about 10 days
as part of international efforts to end the conflict. Yugoslavia
has refused to accept OSCE mediation until its membership in the
54-member organization is restored. Although Yugoslavia stopped
short of accepting OSCE mediation, U.S. and European officials
called the invitation a step in the right direction.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Technology shares lifted the Nasdaq market to
another record, but most stocks fell Thursday, with a profit
warning from DuPont preventing an assault on new highs by the Dow
industrials. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average fell
85.19 points _ or 0.9 percent _ to 9,089.78, giving back most of an
89-point gain from Wednesday that had left the blue-chip barometer
less than 40 points below May 13's record of 9,211.84. (US-CLOSING
STOCKS)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Unemployment in the European Union held
steady at 10.2 percent in May, unchanged from the previous two
months, according to figures released Thursday by the EU's
statistics office. The EU rate compares with 4.4 percent in the
United States and 4.1 percent in Japan. Eurostat's data showed 17.1
million citizens were out of work across the 15-nation bloc.
Year-on-year figures showed a slight decline in the unemployment
level from 10.7 percent in May, 1997, and 10.9 in May, 1996. The
jobless rate in the 11 countries adopting the euro as their common
currency on Jan. 1 was down to 11.2 from 11.3 in April. Luxembourg
had the lowest rate at 2.2 percent, Spain the highest rate with
18.8 percent. (EU-UNEMPLOYMENT)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A leading credit agency lowered its rating of
Vietnam's debt further into speculative territory Thursday, a step
that could make it even more difficult and costly for the
financially troubled Asian nation to borrow money. Vietnam's
ratings on long-term bonds and on bank deposits were already
considered speculative, or in the ``junk'' category. On Thursday,
Moody's dropped the rating on long-term bonds to B1 from Ba3, and
on bank deposits to B3 from B1. Only the service's top four grades
are considered investment quality, from a high of Aaa to the lowest
investment grade Baa. The rating Ba is a grade below investment
quality, and Moody's uses numbers from a high of 1 to a low of 3 to
denote standing within a grade. The B grade is two grades into
speculative territory. (VIETNAM-MOODY'S)
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Motorola Inc. is combining its vast
communications businesses _ including cellular phones, pagers and
satellites _ into one division to become more efficient, the
company said Thursday in unveiling its promised turnaround plan.
The plan will enable the company to shift its focus to selling
packages of its products to consumers, phone companies, government
and industrial customers, said spokesman Tim Kellogg. Motorola's
divisions for satellites, cellular phones, wireless network
equipment and paging accounted for a total of about two-thirds of
the company's dlrs 28.9 billion in sales last year. Much of the
rest came from semiconductors. (US-MOTOROLA)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia has reached a ``decisive'' stage in its
talks with Western lenders, and hopes to reach final agreement this
week on loans to bail out its sinking economy. Anatoly Chubais, the
government's lead negotiator, said he hopes any remaining issues
will be worked out with International Monetary Fund officials in
meetings Friday. Russia says it needs dlrs 10 billion to 15 billion
in new loans to restore confidence in financial markets that have
been in a tailspin for months. But IMF and World Bank may be
reluctant to conclude a loan deal before Russia's parliament
approves an economic stabilization package that tightens tax
collection. The lending agencies consider improved tax revenues to
be the key to a Russian recovery. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Prosecutors investigating Bulgaria's
economic crash a year ago are looking into more than 10,000 bad
loans worth dlrs 1.6 billion, the general prosecutor announced
Thursday. The cases include loans made by 41 state and private
banks to firms and individuals, Prosecutor General Ivan Tatarchev
said. ``Bank executives have allowed loans without any control,
without the necessary guarantees and collateral,'' Tatarchev told
the state news agency BTA. The prosecution is acting on a report on
bad loans published earlier this year by the central bank. While
some of the money has been used to keep inefficient state companies
going, much is suspected to have been embezzled under former
governments controlled by ex-communists. (BULGARIA-BAD LOANS)
	   LONDON (AP) _ Hallmark Cards is buying British rival Creative
Publishing PLC for dlrs 306 million in cash in a deal that will
create Britain's biggest greeting card group with nearly 30 percent
of the market. Hallmark is a leader at the high end of Britain's
greeting card business, selling fancy cards at premium prices.
Creative Publishing is the market leader of boxed cards, such as
Christmas greetings sold in bulk for much cheaper prices per card.
Executives called their companies a perfect fit and said no layoffs
are planned. (BRITAIN-HALLMARK CARDS)

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Matt Damon and Ben Affleck won another award
Thursday for their ``Good Will Hunting'' script, and it came with a
dlrs 25,000 check.
	   The hot young actor-authors received the Humanitas Prize, which
recognizes film and TV scripts that illuminate life and foster
compassion. The ``Good Will Hunting'' screenplay also won an Oscar.
	   Episodes of the television series ``Murphy Brown'' and the
animated series ``Life with Louie'' also won the prizes, given out
by the Human Family and Educational Cultural Institute.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Vaclav Havel took a break Thursday
from forming a new government to schmooze with rocker Lou Reed.
	   The two have known each other since 1990, when Reed interviewed
Havel for Rolling Stone magazine. Reed was in town for a film
festival.
	   ``The president found out that his friend Lou Reed is around and
decided to invite him over for a private visit,'' said Martin
Krafl, a Havel spokesman.
	   Havel thanked the rock star for his hospitality during the
president's last private visit to New York and ``recalled the good
times they had together,'' Krafl said.
	   The visit was a welcome break for Havel as talks continue on
forming a new government. No party won a clear majority in
Parliament during last month's elections.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Joe Jackson, father of singers Michael and
Janet Jackson, had a stroke but didn't appear to suffer any
paralysis, his lawyer said.
	   Jackson, 70, was at home Tuesday when his speech became slurred.
He was hospitalized overnight, Brian Oxman said.
	   ``He is doing much better,'' Oxman said. ``He has from what we
can tell no paralysis anywhere. And his smile is just as big as
ever.'' ___ &QC; 
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Francis Ford Coppola, already awarded dlrs 20
million in compensatory damages by a jury, was granted another dlrs
60 million in punitive damages Thursday in his lawsuit that accused
Warner Bros. studios of thwarting his chances to make a feature
film about ``Pinocchio.''
	   ``Warner Bros. has traditionally not treated its creative people
well,'' Coppola said. ``Hopefully, this will teach them to treat
creative people as an asset, not as serfs.''
	   The studio, which the jury earlier found acted with ``fraud''
and ``malice'' in claiming it owned the screenplay Coppola wanted
to make into a movie, said the latest award was ``simply
ludicrous.''
	   A Warner Bros. spokeswoman said the studio would appeal.
	   The director of the ``Godfather'' trilogy and ``Apocalypse Now''
filed the Superior Court lawsuit against Warner Bros. in 1995. He
sought about dlrs 23 million in damages.
	   The case dates back to 1991 began when Warner Bros. bought a
treatment of Coppola's screenplay from one of his collaborators,
then threatened to sue any other studio that tried to produce it
even though it refused to pay Coppola to develop the film.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Sandra Bullock says she learned to
love her body during a visit to the famous Copacabana beach here
last year.
	   In an exclusive interview with Manchete magazine on newstands
Thursday, the actress said she was inspired by seeing Brazilian
women freely showing off their bodies.
	   ``In Brazil, people are voluptuous but are extremely comfortable
with their bodies,'' she told the weekly magazine adding that the
same was not true in the United States.
	   ``When a friend and I first went to Copacabana beach fully
dressed we felt ridiculous,'' Bullock said. ``The next day I was
already more liberated. I was even thinking of wearing a G-string
bikini!''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) _ Talk about a wide load. An Asian
elephant weighing more than 4,000 kilos (8,800 pounds) traveled for
three days in the back of a semi-trailer from one Canadian zoo to
another.
	   Assiniboine Park Zoo director Doug Ross said the highway trek
didn't faze Limba, a 36-year-old white Asian elephant, one bit.
	   ``She stepped out of the trailer and it was just so nice,'' said
Ross. ``She's just a sweetheart.''
	   Limba, the first elephant at the Winnipeg zoo since 1991, will
be on loan until September when she is to return to her home at the
Bowmanville Zoo in the Ontario province.
	   The elephant, who is expected to live another 30 years, will
make her home in the zoo's camel field.

Romania seen as Thailand of Europe for pedophiles

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Like many 16-year-olds, Ovidiu
idolizes soccer players and characters in the movies. His current
favorite is the lead in ``Titanic,'' the happy-go-lucky Jack
Dawson, because he's a street kid, too.
	   But unlike Dawson, Ovidiu hasn't won a ticket off the streets.
He sleeps in the grass outside a Bucharest railway station, where
he ekes out a living begging and running odd errands.
	   And he struggles with the mental scars from five years of sexual
abuse.
	   Ovidiu, who asked that his last name not be used, is one of the
2,500 or so children estimated to be living on the streets of
Romania's capital. And, like some of those youngsters, he is a
victim of foreign pedophiles drawn to Romania in recent years by
its reputation as a place where it is easy to find sex with
children.
	   Ovidiu, who was talked out of the pedophilia life by a social
worker, says he hasn't come face to face with a pedophile in a year
and is determined to never let another one touch him.
	   ``Now, if I spot a pedophile, I would start talking to him, but
then I tell the police,'' he says.
	   Romania has all the ingredients to attract pedophiles: large
numbers of homeless children looking for comfort, widespread
poverty that makes them susceptible to offers of money or food, and
a perception that law enforcement officials are corrupt or deal
leniently with foreigners.
	   Because communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu banned
contraception and family planning services, Romania has 100,000
abandoned or orphaned children.
	   Ceausescu also banned psychology and social work in 1977, which
left few trained people to help street children. Long neglected and
struggling to get by, some kids will have sex for as little as a
handful of dollars or a packet of cigarettes.
	   Authorities long ignored or were unaware of the problem. Col.
Ioneta Vintileanu, a police official, says the government does not
even keep statistics on pedophile arrests.
	   But in a bid to crack down on the pedophile traffic, the Chamber
of Deputies passed legislation June 25 to make pedophilia a
specific crime. The law, which now goes to parliament's upper
house, covers sexual relations with anyone younger than 14 and
carries a maximum penalty of seven years in prison.
	   Only seven pedophilia cases _ five involving foreigners and two
involving Romanians _ have been publicized since 1996, the first
year that anyone was ever charged in such a case.
	   The first convicted pedophile, Michel Albenque of France, was
caught two years ago, shortly after a conference in Stockholm on
child sex abuse revealed that Romania was attracting pedophiles.
Albenque is now serving a five-year prison term for endangering a
minor.
	   Last August, a British clergyman, the Rev. Michael Taylor, was
charged with forcing two 13-year-old boys to perform oral sex.
Taylor, whose trial is still going on, first denied the charge but
has confessed, authorities say. If convicted, he faces up to seven
years in jail.
	   Police say they also have information about an Italian, a Swiss
and another British man who engaged in sex with children but no
charges have been filed. Two Romanians have been charged with
sexually abusing children.
	   Virginia Hristu, spokeswoman for the Romanian operation of the
United Nations Children's Fund, says typically a pedophile flies in
as a tourist and heads to one of Bucharest's railway stations,
where kids hang out begging and scrounging for food.
	   The pedophile _ almost always a man _ then ``picks out'' a child
and begins working on winning his trust, presenting the youngster
with food and small gifts, she says.
	   When that trust has been won, the pedophile talks the child into
engaging in sex.
	   ``It can take up to two weeks,'' says Ovidiu, who met with a
reporter under the watchful eye of his psychologist, Diana Serban.
	   Authorities are concerned about the Internet, which allows
pedophiles easy communication with children and makes it hard to
catch suspects.
	   George Roman, who works for the Romanian branch of the
international humanitarian group Save the Children, has spent years
tracking and helping police catch pedophiles. He spends hours
surfing the Internet scouring for pedophiles.
	   ``Foreigners come here because they hear that Romania is the
Thailand of eastern Europe,'' he says.
	   Recently, Roman found pictures of young boys on one of the
pedophilia sites on the Internet that he recognized as children
from Bucharest.
	   It was Roman who persuaded Ovidiu to give up having sex with
pedophiles.
	   Ovidiu, skinny and looking about 13, wants to be a social worker
when he grows up, so he can ``tell other children not to do what I
did.''

Hindu hermit guards his Himalayan forest preserve

<TEXT>
	   HIDIMBA MOUNTAIN, India (AP) _ The Hindu hermit stood on his
mountain top, watching a violent hailstorm topple thick-trunked
trees and send them crashing down the lower Himalayan slopes.
	   When followers of 80-year-old Swami Vankhandi climbed up after
the storm, they found that all the trees in his six-hectare
(15-acre) environmental retreat were among the mountain's plant
life that escaped damage. They immediately proclaimed it a miracle.
	   But unlike many other Indian hermits, Swami Vankhandi _ whose
name means ``sage of the forest'' _ does not claim to be a miracle
worker.
	   Rather than cloak his work in mysticism, he shares what he knows
about ancient systems of medicine and nature worship and tries to
teach by example that environmental protection can succeed with
patience and hard work, as well as faith.
	   ``People here did not care for the trees and their environment.
Now they are facing the wrath of the gods,'' he said after the
storm that battered his 1,500-meter-tall (5,000-foot-tall) Hidimba
Mountain.
	   The Indian government estimated in 1997 that the country had a
net loss of about 6,000 square kilometers (2,400 square miles) of
dense forest between 1995 and the last survey in 1996.
	   Swami Vankhandi found only pines and two dry springs when he
arrived four decades ago at his mountain in the Kumaon, the
Himalayan outback that draws millions of tourists every year.
	   He squatted on government-owned land on the mountain top. In his
retreat and elsewhere on the mountain, he has planted more than
3,000 trees and hundreds of medicinal roots, herbs and plants. He
has posted small signs identifying wild, edible tree and shrub
species, orchids, ferns, flowering plants and healing herbs on the
slopes.
	   The swami, or master, also banned logging, foraging for wood or
fodder and hunting in his retreat. Similar government rules had
been ignored for decades, but the swami's orders, although
resented, were followed by most local people who respected his
religious position.
	   But he has enemies. Wood poachers have tried to shoot or poison
him on several occasions, said Sanjay Rattan, an environmental
activist who once worked with the World Wildlife Fund and now
occasionally represents the Hindi-speaking swami at international
environment conferences.
	   ``The people are not happy with me, but the trees and birds
are,'' the swami said.
	   Saffron-robed swamis are common in India. They take vows of
lifelong celibacy and give themselves up to lives of religious
learning, roaming cities, sleeping in temples and living mostly on
offerings from devotees.
	   Swami Vankhandi grew up in a village in the nearby hill resort
of Almora, where he began his religious training. He later lived
alone for 11 years in a cave close to India's mountainous border
with Tibet. When he emerged, it was to do his part for the
preservation of rare plant varieties, animals and birds _ his
lifelong passion.
	   The swami lives alone in a mud-thatched hut that is reached by a
rugged climb. He sustains himself on offerings from local people,
and devotees say he never asks for favors. Some people call him
``the environment saint.''
	   Scientists from the U.S. Agency for International Development,
the World Wildlife Fund and leading Indian botanical laboratories
have taken note of the swami's work. But no one has come through
with money to help finance his work, he said.
	   ``They all come and stay here, say nice things about my efforts,
but go back and forget about it,'' the swami said.
	   In 1995, he stepped out of the forest for the first time in
decades to travel to Japan for an international conference on faith
and the environment, organized by the Alliance on Religion and
Conservation headed by Britain's Prince Philip.
	   Two years later, officials of the international group traveled
to the swami's mountain to discuss a conservation project. But he
rejected it because all spending and decision-making powers would
have been with the group.
	   If, for instance, the swami wanted to build a tank to store
water for the dry summer months, he would have had to get an OK
from faraway officials.
	   ``I can only serve the forest,'' he said.

	   SHENZHEN, China (AP) _ China has undergone an economic
revolution in the past 20 years, and all of it _ from consumerism
to a building boom to great disparities in wealth _ is on display
here, just across the border from Hong Kong.
	   Two decades ago, Shenzhen was little more than a tightly
controlled rural border crossing. Today, its skyscrapers aspire to
rival those of Hong Kong. So does its consumer class.
	   Since it was declared a Special Economic Zone, one of the focal
spots of China's economic transformation, Shenzhen has drawn
several million people. They came seeking factory jobs that paid a
bit better, provided better conditions and offered hope for a
better life than they lived in the interior provinces they left
behind.
	   Now Shenzhen is moving on, outgrowing the factories that are
heading farther inland and turning into a business and commerce
center.
	   Members of an increasingly prosperous class make their money
running factories and services, shop in malls stuffed with consumer
goods and have money to spend on air conditioners to cool southern
China's steamy days. Prostitution and crime flourish.
	   Even families squeezed into one-room apartments have a bit more
money than average Chinese. In the shadow of Shenzhen's new
skyscrapers, they too can contemplate buying anything from lingerie
to electronics in the numerous open markets.
	   People still stream in from the provinces, but it is becoming
harder for the unskilled to find work. Many end up scanning job
postings around town, but those notices are as likely to be for
computer programmers as for factory workers.
	   Some people become beggars, a common sight on the streets today.
Others don't make it at all; after a time, they turn around and go
home.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ When Russia's last czar is finally put to rest
next week, he will be buried in a smaller-than-usual coffin.
Instead of a 21-gun salute, he'll get just 19. And instead of a
bishop or patriarch, a local priest will do the honors.
	   In fact, nearly everything about the funeral of Nicholas II and
his family that starts Wednesday has been scaled down _ but not
because it has become less important.
	   On the contrary, it has been scaled back precisely because the
czar retains enormous political and symbolic power in Russia: The
question of how to bury and honor him has inflamed emotions across
the political spectrum.
	   It was 80 years ago that Nicholas, his wife Alexandra, and their
five children were executed by a Bolshevik firing squad. All but
two of the skeletons were exhumed from a roadside pit in 1991.
	   When planning for the funeral got under way, it was to be a
three-day, no-holds-barred affair, presided over by president and
patriarch, attended by world leaders and ranks of royalty. The
remains were to travel to the imperial capital of St. Petersburg in
a special train that would make stops across Russia, collecting
tributes from ordinary citizens.
	   Now they'll be whisked to St. Petersburg in an Aeroflot jet. The
cortege will travel straight from the airport to the cathedral.
Decorations will be limited to the streets on which the hearses
pass. And when Nicholas is lowered into the crypt, the priest won't
even refer to him by name.
	   Of course, though the symbolism is powerful, it is open to
debate. Katherine Verdery, an American anthropologist who has
studied how ex-socialist countries rebury former leaders, says such
events are politically potent because different people give them
different meanings.
	   ``What gives a dead body symbolic effectiveness in politics is
precisely its ambiguity, its capacity to evoke a variety of
understandings,'' she says.
	   For some Russians, burying the family in proper graves is an act
of national contrition, a way to ask forgiveness for the sins of
communism.
	   For others, it's a way to reclaim history, to bridge the schism
between past and present torn open by the Bolshevik Revolution.
	   For still others, it could be seen as a kind of blessing for the
new regime, a way to pass the scepter of Russian nationhood from
the czar to the government of Boris Yeltsin.
	   The fact that the ceremonies are so weighted with symbolism
helps explain why the Russian Orthodox Church decided to keep its
participation to a bare minimum. No member of the church hierarchy
will be present, and the requiem will be said by a respected, but
local, priest.
	   That decision set off a chain reaction that resulted in the
president pulling out and invitations being scaled back to
ambassadors and relatives.
	   The church says it's reluctant because society is still divided
over the question of whether the bones are those of the czar.
	   But scientists say the forensic evidence is indisputable. Three
separate sets of DNA tests, including one in Britain and another in
the United States, have definitely identified the bones as
belonging to Nicholas, his wife Alexandra, three of their five
children and four servants.
	   The debate over the bones' authenticity is actually part of a
larger battle within the church over how to patch up relations with
Orthodox believers living in exile since the revolution.
	   The exiled church already has canonized the czar, and would take
deep offense if the Moscow-based church were to recognize the bones
as the czar's but bury them without the formalities of sainthood.
The Moscow patriarchate is considering canonizing the family, but
the proceedings will take several more years.
	   So the church has struck an awkward compromise: It will recite a
simple requiem for the souls of all the Romanov martyrs, but not
say whose bones are in the small, skeleton-sized coffins.
Officially, the church will be burying unnamed ``believers.''
	   For their part, ordinary Russians don't quite know what to make
of the whole spectacle. A recent poll showed that the largest
section of the population, 39 percent, expressed no view on the
proceedings.
	   Vika Smirnova falls into that group. Nonetheless, the
20-year-old laboratory assistant made a pilgrimage to the St.
Petersburg cathedral where the coffins will be buried, drawn by the
sense that history will be made there next week.
	   ``It all happened a long time ago,'' she said. ``But at the same
time these things are close to us. This is our czar, our ruler, our
Russia.''

Questions and answers: What happened to the Romanovs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Russia-Burying the Czar; Russia-Czar Ceremony &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Answers to common questions concerning the remains of Russia's
last royal family _ Nicholas II, Alexandra and their five children:
	   Q: How did they die?
	   A: The entire family along with their doctor and three
attendants were lined up against a wall in the basement of a house
in the Ural Mountains city of Yekaterinburg. A firing squad burst
into the room and opened fire, emptying the barrels of their guns.
Jewels sewn into the womens' corsets caused some of the bullets to
ricochet off. The squad used bayonets to finish them off.
	   Q: What happened to the bodies?
	   A: First they were stripped of clothes and jewels and then
dumped in a mine shaft outside town. Grenades were thrown into the
pit to try to destroy them. Rumors quickly circulated in town
identifying the site, so the following day the bodies were
retrieved and the squad set off for another site. When their truck
broke down, they decided to try to destroy the bodies by burning
them. They set fire to two of the smallest corpses _ the eldest son
Alexei and one of his sisters _ but it took a long time to burn
them. The revolutionaries were growing nervous and decided to bury
the rest of the bodies by the side of the road. They poured barrels
of sulfuric acid into the pit in the hope it would destroy the
remains.
	   Q: How were they found?
	   A: In the late 1970s, a local geologist and an interested
filmmaker pooled their resources, eventually obtaining an account
of the botched burial written by the leader of the squad in which
he identified the site. They found the site, dug into the pit, and
retrieved three skulls. Afraid of discovery, however, they later
replaced them and held onto their secret until Mikhail Gorbachev's
glasnost. In 1989, the filmmaker announced he had discovered the
bodies. In July 1991, the same month Boris Yeltsin became Russia's
first president, the bodies were exhumed.
	   Q: How were they identified?
	   A: Russian officials sent samples of the bones to Britain and
the United States for DNA testing. Those tests definitively
concluded that five of the skeletons were members of one family,
and four were unrelated. Of the five, three were the children of
the two parents. The mother was determined to be related to the
British royal family, as was Alexandra. The father was determined
to be related to several other Romanovs. Scientists have said the
accuracy of the identification is greater than 99 percent.
	   Q: Which are the two missing skeletons?
	   A: The body of Alexei, the hemophiliac heir to the throne, is
missing, as is one of his sisters, either Maria or Anastasia. One
American scientist using bone measurement techniques concluded that
the missing sister was Anastasia. But all other tests, including
facial reconstructions, have led investigators to conclude that the
missing skeleton is Maria.
	   Q: What about stories that Alexei or Anastasia escaped?
	   A: Hundreds of people have come forward over the years claiming
to be an escaped member of the royal family. None of the claims
have ever been proven, and claimants who have submitted to DNA
testing have been unrelated to the Romanovs. Perhaps the most
famous pretender, Anna Anderson, was determined by genetic testing
to be a Polish peasant named Franziska Schanzkowska.
	   Q: Why is the Russian Orthodox Church refusing to recognize the
bones as belonging to the czar and his family?
	   A: The debate is tied to larger battles within the church and
with Orthodox believers who have been living in exile since the
revolution. The exiled church has canonized the czar and has made
canonization by the Moscow patriarchate a precondition for
reunification _ which would significantly boost the church's
standing both within Russia and among other branches of Orthodoxy.
The Moscow-based church has started canonization proceedings, but
they are likely to take several more years. In the interim, if they
were to bury the czar without treating his remains as the holy
relics of a saint, the exiled church would take deep offense. Until
the Moscow patriarchate resolves the issue of canonization and
comes to an understanding on reunification with the exiled church,
it is unlikely to be able to move forward on identifying the bones.
	   Q: What will happen if the Russian Orthodox Church canonizes
Nicholas and the rest of the family?
	   A: According to Orthodox tradition, they will be exhumed,
ritually washed and dressed in sacred garments. After canonization
rites, they will be interred in special above-ground boxes known as
reliquaries, and their bones will be objects of veneration.

World Cup: Brazilian goalie Taffarel hits big time in Turkey
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SELCAN HACAOGLU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Taffarel is not only a hero for
Brazilians. But for Turks as well.
	   Reigning Turkish league champion Galatasaray of Istanbul is
proud to have signed him on for next season.
	   Especially after saving two penalty kicks by Dutch strikers to
secure Brazil's place in Sunday's World Cup final against France.
	   ``It is proven that we made a correct decision,'' Galatasaray
coach Fatih Terim said. ``We will reach out to great successes in
Europe and at home with Taffarel.''
	   Taffarel signed a two-year, dlrs 1.5 million contract with the
12-time league champion Galatasaray on June 24 in Paris.
	   His performance in the World Cup quickly pleased Turkish fans
and the media.
	   ``We kiss you Taffarel,'' headlined daily Sabah on Wednesday.
	   The 32-year-old warded off shot after shot against the
relentless Dutch strikers. But he saved the best for last, blocking
two attempts in a penalty-kick shootout _ that ranks as one of the
most important and tense in Brazil's soccer history.
	   Galatasaray president Faruk Suren said the club, which will
represent Turkey in the European Champions Cup next year, will not
have any problems in goal.
	   The club has been desperately seeking a goalkeeper for the past
few years worthy of the champion team.
	   ``Taffarel relieved Galatasaray fans with saves like those of a
panther,'' the sports daily Foto Mac said Thursday.
	   But fans have already started to worry that Taffarel's position
in the Brazilian national team could hurt Galatasaray if he misses
too many domestic games.
	   ``I am very glad that he joined Galatasaray, he is superb,''
said Candan Kurkcuoglu, a fan. ``But, I hope he won't leave us too
often.''
	   Taffarel was a starter on Brazil's World Cup team in 1990.
Brazil was knocked out in the second round and Taffarel began a
long slide that reached a low point when he was benched on Italy's
Parma.
	   In 1994, he allowed only three goals during the World Cup, in
which Brazil won an unprecedented fourth title. In that final, he
also saved a spot kick in a penalty shootout against Italy.
	   It was downhill again after that, and Taffarel seemed to be
playing out his career on Atletico Mineiro until Brazilian coach
Mario Zagallo wanted his experience on the renewed national team he
was assembling this year.
	   ``I promised the championship to Galatasaray fans after signing
the contract,'' daily Fanatik quoted Taffarel as saying on
Thursday. ``I will keep my promise.''
	   His wife, Andrea, visited Istanbul last month to look for a
house.
	   Galatasaray finished last season with a 23-6-5 record and 75
points, four points ahead of rival Fenerbahce.
	   Taffarel's transfer would boost Galatasaray's power against
Fenerbahce which recently transferred another Brazilian soccer
player, Sergio Neves from Saudi Arabia's Alahari team.
	   Fenerbahce won championships under famous Brazilian coaches
Walderia Didi in early 1970s and Alberto Parreira in 1996.

Danes, Chileans, Mexican and especially Croats win new respect
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BRIAN TRUSDELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Denmark and Paraguay! Chile and Mexico! And who
really considered Croatia a threat?
	   These weren't darkhorses, they were exercise horses, thrown in
to round out the World Cup field, and then had more than their
opponents scrambling.
	   Called ``El Tritanic'' by its own media in the run-up to the
World Cup as a mocking reference to their usual nickname of El
Tricolor, Mexico's qualification for the second round after a tie
with the semifinalist Dutch opened many eyes.
	   Especially after two-goal, second-half rallies against both the
Belgians and the Netherlands to earn 2-2 draws.
	   Against the Germans, the Mexicans led 1-0 until a pair of goals
in the final 15 minutes stalled the Aztec engine in a 2-1 defeat
and elimination.
	   ``This proves we're not the pudding we were made out to be,''
said Mexican coach Manuel Lapuente, who was harshly criticized in
the month before the start of the tournament.
	   But the flicker from the Mexicans was dim compared with the
explosion of semifinalist Croatia.
	   With seven of its starting 11 playing in first division in major
Western European leagues, the 66-1 outsider clearly had the talent.
Yet it had to beat Ukraine in the two-leg playoff to get to the
World Cup and many disregarded it as a serious threat.
	   With names like AC Milan's Zvonimir Boban, Real Madrid's Davor
Suker and Real Betis' Robert Jarni, the Croats scored unspectacular
but convincing victories over Jamaica and Japan and a 1-0 loss to
Argentina to reach the last 16.
	   Croatia, a nation of scant more than 5 million, only came into
being as a country in 1991. It wasn't able to put a qualifying
effort together for the 1994 World Cup in the United States and
then in its first major competition made it to the quarterfinals of
the 1996 European Championship in England.
	   It was beaten by the Germans 2-1 in that game, a loss it avenged
in the World Cup quarters with a 3-0 victory over the three-time
champions, one of the biggest upsets in World Cup history.
	   Despite the Croats loss in the semifinals to host France, it's
unlikely they will be treated as a heavy underdog again.
	   Neither will Chile.
	   The last of five South American teams, it only got to France
thanks to goal difference over Peru.
	   It's advancement to the second round on a trio of draws, one of
which could have been a 2-1 victory over Italy save for a disputed
penalty in the 84th minute, was even more triumphant considering
that it was returning from a cheating scandal during qualifying in
1989. It was expelled from the 1990 qualifying tournament and
barred from trying to qualify in 1994.
	   It's ``reward'' for reaching the second round was a meeting with
four-time champion Brazil, which won handily 4-1 and, in some
respects, tarnished Chile's achievement.
	   While Chile came with Salas and his even more highly regarded
striking partner Ivan Zamorano, Paraguay came with only one widely
known player, and he played in the back _ goalkeeper Jose Luis
Chilavert.
	   But it mustered enough offense for a 3-1 victory over Nigeria in
the Group D finale, reached the second round and even drew the
attention of FIFA president Sepp Blatter.
	   ``Maybe the surprise is Paraguay,'' Blatter said after the first
round. ``Although not if you look at the way they played in
qualifying.''
	   It, too, had an unlucky second-round draw _ host France. And
after appearing to play for penalty kicks, finally succumbed 1-0 in
the first ``Golden Goal'' in World Cup history.
	   Not the least of the head-turners was Denmark, who have a knack
of surprising the soccer world.
	   The Danes more than caused a stir when, in 1992, it was called
in less than two weeks before the start of the European
Championship to replace Yugoslavia, banned by United Nations
sanctions, and promptly won the title.
	   But it didn't even qualify for the 1994 World Cup.
	   So when it reached France as the top team from an admittedly
weak qualifying group, then scraped into the second round over
teams like South Africa and Saudi Arabia, not much was expected.
	   A 4-1 second-round victory over a much more highly regarded
Nigerian squad raised the bar, and a 3-2 loss to Brazil in the
quarters _ after taking the lead only two minutes into the game _
won some converts to the ``Danish Dynamite''.
	   ``It was great propaganda for Danish football,'' midfielder
Michael Laudrup said. ``We played Brazilian-style football.''

World Cup: Blanc's dismissal latest in list of feigning incidents
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CLAIREFONTAINE, France (AP) _ One man's cheat is another's
misfortune.
	   The World Cup has seen some world class acting almost from day
one. It has cost people yellow cards, red cards and Laurent Blanc
the brightest day of his long career.
	   Time and again, French television repeated from every angle how
Blanc planted his palm on the chin of Slaven Bilic, yet the
Croatian went down holding his forehead as if hit by a
sledgehammer.
	   Red card for Blanc, and FIFA's own sledgehammer inevitably
followed late Thursday with a two-match suspension that costs one
of the World Cup's greatest defenders an appearance in the final.
	   ``The referee robbed him off his final,'' said France's coach
Aime Jacquet.
	   That there was a foul was beyond doubt. That it deserved an
expulsion was another issue. Bilic's theatrics certainly didn't
help and there are no plans to punish the Croatian.
	   With 24 hours hindsight, even Blanc recognized the Croatian's
driving force.
	   ``He was trying to win his match,'' almost trying to apologize
for Bilic's action that cost him the final.
	   Then again, such stuff is happening close to home for Blanc. In
the same press tent where he was exhorting his sorrow, a few days
earlier Zinedine Zidane admitted that he feigned a tumble after a
challenge from Giuseppe Bergomi in the quarterfinal. It earned the
Italian defender a yellow card he did not deserve.
	   By now, each of the 32 participating nations can surely think of
one incident where an opponent tricked or feigned a foul, making
unfair play almost an institution in the World Cup.
	   On day three, Belgian defender Lorenzo Staelens went down like a
man struck by lightning when Dutchman Patrick Kluivert shoved him.
A foul? Sure. A two-match suspension followed.
	   To one nation, it's a clear and obvious penalty. Like the crash
of Englishman Michael Owen in the Argentine penalty area. To the
other it's cheating.
	   None at this World Cup were as bad as Roberto Rojas' act in
1989.
	   Goalkeeper Rojas cut himself when a flare was thrown near him
during a match in Rio de Janeiro. Losing 1-0, Chile walked off the
field in protest, carring the bleeding Rojas on a stretcher.
	   An inquiry however found Rojas faked the injury and FIFA barred
him from playing at the national level for life. It barred Chile
from the 1990 and 1994 World Cups, banned coach Orlando Aravena and
issued lesser sanctions to several other officials and players.
	   In comparison, the worst fakers get off with a yellow card at
worst.
	   For Blanc, all that's left is a bitter taste in the mouth.
	   ``I have this feeling of having tasted the cake, but now I'm not
allowed to touch the cherry,'' said Blanc. ``It's a personal
catastrophe,'' the 32-year old defender said.
	   Bilic remained unrepentant.
	   ``I didn't get him sent off, he did,'' the Croat defender said.
	   ``He touched me, technically that's an offense, and the referee
saw it.''

World Cup: Organizers say security is a success despite incidents,
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHANIE VAN DEN BERG &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The French organizing committee and FIFA say World
Cup security measures were successful in spite of violence that
erupted in two cities early in the tournament.
	   ``Under the circumstances we know it was a success even though
we know there were incidents,'' Horst Schmidt, head of security for
the world soccer federation, said Thursday.
	   Schmidt and his counterpart on the France 98 organizing
committee, Dominique Spinosi, stressed that stadiums were almost
trouble-free and that the worst violence occurred outside the
playing areas.
	   Under French law, the World Cup organizers are responsible for
security in and around the stadiums. Security in other urban areas
bordering on the stadiums is the responsibility of French police.
	   ``We cannot take care of the problems which arise in cities. We
can only act as advisors to the police,'' Schmidt said.
	   Spinosi played down the street battles between local youths and
English fans in Marseille on June 13-15, calling the clashes ``an
alcohol-related brawl.''
	   ``The problems with the English fans were ... alcohol
consumption and the loss of control on their part,'' she said.
	   The supporters who drank too much were not by definition
hooligans, according to Spinosi.
	   The World Cup's other serious incident occurred June 21 in Lens,
in northern France, where several hundred masked, well-organized
German extremists met to fight with French security forces posted
for the Yugoslavia-Germany match.
	   Several thugs attacked a 44-year-old policeman, David Nivel,
with an iron bar, smashing his skull and leaving him senseless on a
street. Nivel is still comatose in a hospital in Lille, with his
condition said to be improving.
	   ``There were 450 people known to be members of extremist groups
from 30 cities in Germany who got together to fight the security
forces,'' Spinosi said. ``What they found were security forces that
controlled the situation.''
	   Spinosi noted that Nivel was a regular policeman, not a member
of the special security forces for the World Cup. Had he not been
injured, she said, the trouble in Lens would not have been judged
so harshly.
	   Both Spinosi and Schmidt blamed a lack international laws for
not being able to stop hooligans coming into France. The Schengen
treaty allows people to travel freely among European Union
countries.
	   ``We did know that these people would be in France,'' Schmidt
said. ``Legislation was not good enough that it could be avoided
that these people showed up.''
	   Spinosi and Schmidt both praised the cooperation with foreign
police forces, especially officers specialized in identifying known
hooligans and troublemakers. Arrests and expulsions could be
carried out against some before they made trouble.
	   ``It's impossible to put 10,000 police around a group of people
and put everyone in jail. You have to identify trouble makers and
put them in court,'' Spinosi said.
	   The organizers said they chose to keep the venues open and the
mood festive for the World Cup.
	   ``If we made our French cities into bunkers we would miss the
World Cup,'' Spinosi said.

World Cup: Repeat of 1986? Bring it on
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ If Sunday's World Cup final is anything like the
last time Brazil and France met in the tournament, well, bring it
on.
	   A dozen years ago in the quarterfinals at Guadalajara, Mexico,
an entertaining, aggressive France met the usually creative,
sometimes brilliant squad from Brazil.
	   Unlike this year's final, in which the four-time champion
Brazilians are favored, that game was considered a tossup. France
featured possibly the best midfielder in the world in Michel
Platini _ the organizer of France 98. It had such other stalwarts
as Luis Hernandez, Jean Tigana, Jean-Pierre Papin and Dominique
Rocheteau. The French could score with anyone.
	   Brazil featured Careca, Zico, Socrates, Julio Cesar and Junior,
all considered among its greatest players.
	   ``It'll be a battle for control of the midfield and we'll have
to close up the lanes and block the space,'' Junior said, echoing
the exact task the French will have on Sunday in Stade de France.
	   ``We have the belief we can compete with Brazil,'' coach Henri
Michel said. ``We are a strong team, also.''
	   The two strong teams pushed for a goal early and never stopped.
	   Brazil's Muller hit the goalpost and the crossbar. Rocheteau
missed a wide open net.
	   In the 17th minute, Careca, one of Brazil's greatest finishers,
completed a three-way move with Muller and Junior, sending a
one-touch shot past goalkeeper Joel Bats.
	   The French didn't back down to merely try to keep it close. It
simply was not their style, and they got the tying goal as Platini
ended a scramble in the penalty area with a short shot. On his 31st
birthday, no less.
	   That was the only goal Brazil allowed all tournament.
	   Brazil looked like it was in charge when Bats was forced to
tackle Branco in the box with 16 minutes to go. Awarded a penalty
kick, up stepped Zico _ now the team's coordinator, but then one of
its veteran players.
	   He missed, with Bats making a diving save.
	   In overtime, both teams had excellent scoring opportunities, but
couldn't find the net. That led to the shootout.
	   Brazil was magnificent in its semifinal shootout against the
Netherlands on Tuesday in Marseille, knocking in all four penalty
kicks to win. But back in Mexico, it hardly was as sharp.
	   Socrates, another veteran, shot to Bats' right and the goalie
got there to block it. Yannick Stopyra scored for France.
	   Alemao was successful for Brazil and Manuel Amoros hit for
France. Zico, getting another chance, drilled in his shot, but
Bruno Bellone connected. It was 3-2 for France.
	   Branco evened matters, but Platini certainly would give the
French the lead. Sorry _ he shot well over the crossbar.
	   That brought on Julio Cesar with a chance to give Brazil the
lead and force Hernandez to score to keep France in the shootout.
But he hit the goalpost, putting Hernandez in position to win it.
	   No problem.
	   That began wild celebrations on the field and in Paris _ the
kind expected Sunday if France wins.
	   And it began some deep soul-searching in Brazil, where the world
title is considered a birthright.
	   ``It's time now to form a new selection that has possibilities
for winning the next World Cup,'' midfielder Elzo said. ``This
can't afford to wait four years.''
	   Tele Santana, who resigned as Brazilian coach after the loss,
looked for consolation in the quality and high drama of the match,
calling it ``the best I've ever seen in a World Cup . . . it should
have been the final.''
	   This time, it is.

World Cup: Americans lead the parade of fallers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY WILNER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Seven coaches lost their jobs. One team fell from
potential semifinalist to first-round casualty. And two three-time
World Cup winners couldn't get out of the quarterfinals after
barely getting there.
	   France 98 was filled with flops, from Europe to Africa to Asia
to America. The biggest disaster, of course, was the U.S. team's
performance.
	   After impressive victories over Brazil and Argentina since the
last World Cup, the Americans seemed to have the right mixture of
experience, youth, speed and creativity. They had a coach who knew
his players well, spoke their language _ a key in American soccer _
and had gotten them to respond.
	   Then it all fell apart. Steve Sampson began to tinker. He had a
tiff with captain John Harkes, one of the team's most popular
players, and cut him.
	   He also, for the most part, ignored his veterans. Then he turned
ultraconservative for the first match with Germany.
	   The results were ugly: 0-3, including an historic 2-1 loss to
Iran, and a last-place overall finish out of 32 teams. Sampson
resigned days later.
	   Still, the United States is a relative neophyte on soccer's
landscape. Such powers as Spain, Bulgaria and Belgium could not get
out of the first round, while three-time champions Italy and
Germany went down in the quarterfinals, much earlier than they
expected to get tested, let alone lose.
	   Spain was one of the favorites heading into the World Cup, but
when it blew a lead to Nigeria in its opener and lost, it was left
to scramble. Not even a 6-1 rout of the Bulgarians, who never
seemed much interested in being here, could save the Spaniards.
	   ``We expected more. But we're going out with our heads high,
because although we didn't go through, we fought to the end,''
defender Miguel Angel Nadal said.
	   Bulgaria looked weak throughout two losses and a tie, four years
after a sensational World Cup in which it upset Germany and
finished fourth.
	   ``My morale didn't allow me to stay around any longer,'' said
coach Hristo Bonev, who resigned when the team got back to Sofia.
	   Bonev joined Sampson and the coaches of Saudi Arabia (Carlos
Alberto Parreira, who led Brazil to the championship in 1994),
Japan, Tunisia, South Korea and South Africa in being fired or
resigning. Several others said before the tournament they would not
remain in the job.
	   The Italians, who lost in a quarterfinal shootout to France
after a lackluster second-round win against Norway, seemed to lose
focus after the first round. They got too cautious, not playing up
their strength at striker, and it cost them.
	   Germany was the oldest team in the field with more than half its
starters 30 or over.
	   Nigeria, the Olympic champion and a 1994 quarterfinalist, got
off to a rousing start, then sputtered. Denmark blew away the only
African team to get out of the first round 4-1. That was a big
disappointment for that continent, which had five representatives _
two more than in '94 _ and for FIFA, which pinpointed Africa as the
future of soccer.
	   Scotland, for the eighth straight time, couldn't get out of the
opening round; South Korea failed for the fifth time. Cameroon,
once a budding power in Africa, was eliminated after three games.
Saudi Arabia, which went to the second round in the '94 World Cup,
fizzled here, as did Belgium and perennial underachievers Colombia
and Austria.
	   England came to the World Cup primed to go far with a solid
defense, steady scorer Alan Shearer and rising star Michael Owen.
But by blowing a first-round game to Romania in the final moments,
it was relegated to second in its group. That meant Argentina in
the second round, and despite a valiant effort playing a man down
for more than 73 minutes, the English lost in a shootout.
	   ``There was such a strange emotion, a feeling among us about how
well we'd done and what we should have achieved,'' England coach
Glenn Hoddle said. ``That's the saddest thing. It wasn't that we'd
lost to Argentina or that we had been knocked out, but that we'll
never know what we could have achieved.
	   ``I felt we would have gone from strength to strength and
perhaps gone all the way and won it.''

	   PARIS (AP) _ Come on you Reds!
	   The World Cup has produced an All-Stars lineup with a
difference.
	   Dutch star Patrick Kluivert teams with Frenchman Zinedine Zidane
in attack with England's David Beckham and Argentina's Ariel Ortega
sparking the moves from behind.
	   At the back, talented French star Laurent Blanc patrols the
defense alongside Germany's Christian Woerns and Dutch defender
Arthur Numan.
	   Throw in Cameroon defender Rigobert Song, Scottish midfielder
Craig Burley and his Glasgow Celtic team-mate from Denmark, Morten
Wieghorst, and the lineup is taking shape.
	   All it needs is a goalkeeper.
	   But there isn't one.
	   All these stars have been sent off during the World Cup, some of
them after some standout performances for their teams. With just
two games left, the final and the third/fourth place game, no
goalkeepers have so far been expelled.
	   In Woerns case, he was expelled for hauling down a Croatian
striker who was about to race for goal.
	   A goalkeeper may not be necessary.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ Desperate to get away from AC Milan after a
confidence-sapping season, Patrick Kluivert maybe on his way to
Tottenham.
	   According to the Evening Standard newspaper, Spurs had
negotiated a 7.5 million pound (dlrs 12.45 million) fee with Milan
and the deal hinged on the striker's consent.
	   Earlier this week, the 22-year-old striker was reportedly close
to signing with Arsenal after the Premier League champions agreed
to a 7 million pound (dlrs 11.62 million) deal with AC Milan.
	   However, the Evening Standard reported Arsenal's interest cooled
because of his likely wage damands, estimated to be about 30,000
pounds (dlrs 49,800) a week.
	   After helping Ajax Amsterdam to a 1-0 Champions Cup final
triumph over Milan in 1996, Kluivert moved to Milan. Hampered by
injuries, his form slumped and he lost his place.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ Defending champion Brazil and host France will both
play in their traditional colors in Sunday's World Cup final.
	   The French, who had to play in all-white in the quarterfinal
against Italy and then all-blue in the semifinal against Croatia,
will face the Brazilians in blue shirts, white shorts and red socks
when they make their first appearance in the final.
	   Brazil, aiming to stretch its record of titles to five, will
wear yellow shirts, blue shorts and white socks.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Taffarel's two penalty saves did
more than just guarantee a spot in the World Cup finals for Brazil.
They gave the world two more Taffarels.
	   Two sets of parents named new born babies Taffarel in honor of
the Brazilian goalkeeper, newspapers reported Thursday.
	   The babies, a boy and a girl, were born shortly after Taffarel
knocked away two penalty kicks to give Brazil the victory over
Holland in the Cup semi-finals Tuesday.
	   Igor Taffarel was born in Belo Horizonte, 210 miles (339 kms)
north of Rio de Janeiro, as the gripping shoot-out took place, the
O Dia newspaper reported. Bruna Taffarel came into the world in
Brasilia, 577 miles (931 kms) northwest of Rio, shortly after.
	   Her parents considered naming their baby after Brazilian striker
Ronaldo but opted for Taffarel after his match-winning performance,
the daily reported.

Annan says India, Pakistan close to talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs. CORRECTS last graf to letters delivered to heads
of region sted names leaders
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. chief said Thursday that Pakistan
and India appeared ready to hold talks on security and other issues
_ including Kashmir _ by the end of July and that he himself might
visit the region.
	   In a letter to the Security Council, Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said he was encouraged by indications from leaders of both
countries and would continue efforts to bring the two sides
together to discuss nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament.
	   A meeting between the two heads of state during a South Asian
regional meeting in Colombo, Sri Lanka at the end of July is likely
to materialize, Annan wrote.
	   Tensions between the south Asian neighbors escalated after India
detonated five underground nuclear explosions in early May.
Pakistan responded with six tests, heightening tensions between the
rivals who have fought three wars in the last 50 years.
	   Two of the wars have been over India-controlled Kashmir, where
Muslim rebels have been fighting a separatist war since 1989. India
has two-thirds of the northern territory and Pakistan the rest,
while both claim all of Kashmir.
	   Annan's letter was circulated to council members Thursday as his
envoy, Alvaro de Soto, briefed the council on his recent trip to
Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. He canceled a visit to India
after New Delhi said he was not welcome.
	   ``Mr. de Soto's contacts with regional leaders, while not as
complete as would have been desirable, nevertheless confirmed my
concern that the new situation which had emerged following the
developments of May, compounding as it does the longstanding causes
of friction between India and Pakistan, may have serious
implications for peace and security in the region and beyond,''
Annan wrote.
	   ``In this connection, I have been encouraged by indications from
both sides of their readiness to enter into a dialogue addressing
peace and security matters and causes of tension, including
Kashmir,'' he wrote.
	   India has flatly rejected international mediation over the
Kashmir dispute. Pakistan has urged the United Nations and others
to step in.
	   De Soto delivered letters with Annan's offer to visit the region
``at the appropriate time,'' to heads of state of the region.

Russia seeks new loan from international lenders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia has reached a ``decisive'' stage in its
talks with Western lenders and hopes to reach final agreement this
week on loans to bail out its sinking economy.
	   Anatoly Chubais, the government's lead negotiator, said he hopes
any remaining issues will be worked out with International Monetary
Fund officials in meetings Friday.
	   Russia says it needs dlrs 10 billion to 15 billion in new loans
to restore confidence in financial markets that have been in a
tailspin for months.
	   But IMF and the World Bank may be reluctant to conclude a loan
deal before Russia's parliament approves an economic stabilization
package that tightens tax collection. The lending agencies consider
improved tax revenues to be the key to a Russian recovery.
	   Parliament's lower house is not scheduled to meet again until
July 15, and the Communists and other opposition members have
strong reservations about measures that would raise taxes.
	   Russian stocks inched upward Thursday, but trading was minimal
as most investors waited to see what the IMF and World Bank will
do.
	   Gary Kinsey, a trader at the Brunswick Warburg brokerage, said
the market is edgy about the prospects for a devaluation of the
ruble if the lending agencies don't come up with enough cash to
support the Russian currency.
	   ``Nobody knows what the fallout would be of a real
devaluation,'' he said.
	   The Association of Russian Banks issued an estimate Thursday
that devaluation would cost the country's banks more than 50
billion rubles (dlrs 8.3 billion) _ a sum 2.5 times their total
pretax profits, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   But President Boris Yeltsin continues to insist that the
government will not permit the ruble to fall.
	   ``We will firmly keep the ruble from devaluation,'' Yeltsin told
reporters in the Kremlin.
	   Thursday's talks with the World Bank focused on a structural
adjustment loan that would give the Russian government dlrs 600
million to dlrs 800 million in budget support, officials said.
	   The government would like the loan as soon as possible to deal
with a wide range of problems. Millions of workers have to wait
months for their salaries. Labor unrest is on the rise. The Russian
stock market has fallen by more than half so far this year, and
foreign investors are fleeing in droves.

Mexico's treasury secretary says budget cut is permanent'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexican Treasury Secretary Jose Angel Gurria
has said that the latest round of government spending cuts was a
``permanent'' response to lost oil export income.
	   In an address before members of the American Chamber of
Commerce, Gurria said Thursday that authorities ``hope this winter
will be more severe'' than last winter, when unusually warm weather
in the northern hemisphere led to a fall in world oil demand.
	   But he said the government avoided making assumptions about
improving conditions in the oil market and chose a ``permanent
adjustment'' over alternatives such as increased debt.
	   Mexico cut 1998 spending an additional 5.5 billion pesos (dlrs
617 million), on Wednesday to counter the drop in oil revenue.
	   The government now expects the average price of Mexican crude to
sell for dlrs 11.50 a barrel in 1998, down from the previous
estimate of dlrs 12.50.
	   The drop, coupled with oil export reductions agreed to with
other world producers, entails a further public revenue loss in
1998 of 9.8 billion pesos (dlrs 1.1 billion), although the latest
spending cuts were tempered by higher-than-expected tax collections
and income from privatizations.
	   Gurria said one of the effects of globalization is that
shortcomings in economic policy are immediately punished in the
marketplace, in the exchange rate or investment, regardless of
whether analysts and others agree with the measures.
	   He also reiterated the estimate that gross domestic product
growth in 1998 would be between 4.5 percent and 5 percent. The
government hasn't moved its growth target of 5 percent as a result
of the latest budget cuts.

President-elect Andres Pastrana said he met Thursday with the

Byrum leader in the first round of Quad City tournament
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER THORNE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COAL VALLEY, Illinois (AP) _ Curt Byrum sank a 20-foot (6-meter)
putt on his final hole Thursday for a 7-under-par 63 and a
one-stroke lead over four players in the first round of the Quad
City Classic.
	   Byrum, a Nike Tour regular who got into this PGA Tour event with
a sponsor's exemption, rode a hot putter to overcome two early
bogeys.
	   Playing the back nine first, he had bogeys after driving into
the trees on No. 14 and into the rough on 18. But he birdied his
last four holes.
	   ``I really didn't let the bogeys bother me, and I'm sure that
helped me get things going down the road,'' he said.
	   Dave Stockton Jr., Hal Sutton, Steve Jones and D.A. Weibring
each shot 64s over the 6,696-yard (6,093-meter) Oakwood Country
Club course. Casey Martin, who won a lawsuit for the right to ride
a cart in PGA tournaments, shot a 66, and John Daly shot a
3-under-par 67.
	   Byrum called the first-round lead a relief after struggling to
overcome elbow surgery in 1996 and torn rib muscles in 1997.
	   ``You get to wondering. Obviously, these last couple years, with
the injuries and all,'' he said, his voice trailing off with a
shrug. ``It's a surprise.''
	   Byrum's best finish this year was ninth in the Nike Greater
Austin Open. Of 14 Nike tournaments, he's made the cut in seven.
	   A lack of wind helped scoring at Oakwood, although many players
said the short game was tricky because of slopes and bowls on the
greens.
	   ``Even though the greens are fair in size, if you hit it on the
wrong side of the slope it kind of makes you sorry you did,'' said
Sutton, winner of the 1983 PGA Championship and the 1986 Phoenix
Open. ``You've got to pick the shots when you (decide to) shoot at
the flag pole.''
	   Byrum, who has played in the Quad City every year since 1992,
said familiarity with the greens definitely gave him an edge.
	   ``I'm pretty comfortable reading the greens,'' he said. ``I
putted well, and that's got to give you some confidence.''

Dollar higher in Tokyo, Japanese stocks fall in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen early Friday
amid uncertainty over the outlook for the sluggish Japanese economy
and the outcome of elections this Sunday. Tokyo stocks drifted
lower.
	   The dollar bought 141.12 yen in early trading, up 0.88 yen from
late Thursday in Tokyo and also slightly above its late New York
rate of 141.10 yen overnight.
	   The dollar rose on worry Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's
government has not done enough to stimulate the economy by failing
to detail proposed tax cuts, traders said.
	   It was also buoyed by concern economic reforms could be delayed
if Hashimoto's ruling party suffers a big loss in elections on
Sunday for the upper house of Parliament, they said.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue benchmark Nikkei
Stock Average fell 13.43 points, or 0.08 percent, to 16,433.52
points in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Wednesday, it lost
84.02 points, or 0.51 percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section declined 3.69 points, or 0.29 percent, to 1,258.59.
The TOPIX closed down 6.12 points, or 0.48 percent, the day before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.370 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.360 percent,
driving its price down to 110.66 yen from 110.73 yen.

Mahathir says there is no cronyism in Malaysia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
claimed that his detractors within the governing party no longer
believe that Malaysia is plagued by nepotism and cronyism.
	   ``There is no nepotism and cronyism in Malaysia. Only foreigners
and the foreign media are making such allegations of nepotism and
cronyism,'' Mahathir told reporters Thursday after a meeting of his
United Malays National Organization.
	   Last month's UMNO annual convention was rocked by accusations of
party bosses misusing an affirmative action program for Malays to
enrich their friends and relatives by awarding them lucrative
government contracts.
	   Mahathir had reacted sharply, portraying the attack on
corruption and favoritism as an assault on the affirmative action
policy which fixed quotas for the dominant Malays in business, jobs
and education.
	   He completed his political triumph by releasing lists of people
who were awarded some of the contracts in an attempt to convince
critics that there was no bias. Among the prominent names was that
of Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, the powerful youth wing chief, who had led
the campaign that was seen by many as an attack on Mahathir.
	   ``There is no longer any misunderstanding and Datuk Zahid
himself no longer believes there is nepotism and cronyism in
Malaysia,'' said Mahathir, who is the party president.
	   Mahathir, 72, became Asia's longest-serving leader after
President Suharto's recent ouster in Indonesia. His 17-year rule
has been uninterrupted despite many political challenges from
within the governing party.

Marion Jones: rising star who wants to be remembered
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By KRISTIAN KAHRS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ She used to have Jesse Owens and Carl Lewis
as her role models. Now, 22-year-old sprint ace Marion Jones is her
own role model.
	   ``I'm running well, and there is no time for role models,'' she
said.
	   In the Golden League opener at Bislett Stadium on Thursday,
Jones won the 100-meter race in 10.82 seconds. She has the five
fastest times of the year this season, including a 10.71 at
Chengdu, China, in May and the USA Championships at New Orleans
last month.
	   And she is pushing Florence Griffith Joyner's world record time
at 10.49 from 1988.
	   ``My ultimate goal is to be the greatest female athlete who have
ever competed, and I want to win five gold medals in Sydney,'' a
confident Jones said.
	   She is already a favorite to grab the dlrs one million jackpot
in the Golden League. There is only a few obstacles; she has to win
the remaining five races. Still, Jones is not easily frightened.
	   One million dollars?
	   ``What about the million dollars? It's a lot of money. If they
want to give away the million dollars, I'm not going to throw it
away,'' Jones said, adding that she is not in track for the money.
	   All she wants is to compete, and the jackpot does not make her
nervous.
	   ``There is no added pressure on me,'' she said. ``Every time I
run, I pressure myself to run faster every time I start.''
	   In the next Olympics in Sydney, she wants five gold medals in
the 100 and 200 meters, the long jump, and 400 and 1,600 relays.
However, five are enough, even if some people think she should go
for the 400 as well.
	   ``The 400 is not of my favorite events because it hurts too
much,'' she grinned.
	   Jones also would like to bring some of the atmosphere and
interest for athletics in Europe back to the United States.
	   ``Track and field is not the same in Europe as the USA, and
that's a shame. We cannot even fill the stands for our national
championships. That's why we come over here,'' she said.
	   Jones won her 100-meter in front of a packed Bislett Stadium.
	   ``It's very exciting to come here and break the track record in
front of this wonderful and enthusiastic crowd,'' she said.
	   Despite her age, Jones has a great record as an athlete. In
college, she proved herself as a point guard for North Carolina's
1995 NCAA basketball champions. However, she decided to concentrate
on track after the Tar Heels failed to make the Final Four in March
1997.
	   When she was a 16-year-old high school junior in California, she
finished fifth in the 100 and fourth in the 200 at the 1992 U.S.
Olympic trials and earned an alternate's spot on the 400-meter
relay team.
	   In other events at Bislett Stadium, Ethiopia's Haile
Gebrselassie missed a world-record attempt in the 3,000 meters by
more than six seconds.
	   ``Seven 20 is very fast,'' he said. ``It's a very good record. I
thought I could do it, but during the warm-up I felt it wasn't warm
enough for a new record.
	   Gebrselassie clocked 7:27.42, the fastest time of the year.
	   In his first two races this season, Gebrselassie shattered world
records at 10,000 meters (26:22.75) at Hengelo, Holland, and then
the 5,000 mark (12:39.36) in another Grand Prix meet at Helsinki,
Finland. He has set 14 world records and world bests during his
career.
	   Jonathan Edwards, the world-record holder from Britain, had
another seasonal best as he won the triple jump at 18.01 meters.
His world record from the 1995 World Championships is 18.29.
	   Edwards' jump was the fourth-longest in history and the best in
the world for two years.
	   For Sergei Bubka, the miseries continued in a stadium where the
great Ukrainian pole vaulter often had problems in the past.
	   Bubka, who has broken more world records (17 outdoors and 18
indoors) than any other athlete, failed to clear his opening height
at 5.60 meters.
	   ``My only comment today is 'no comment,'' said Bubka before
leaving the stadium through the back entrance, which was unlocked
on his request.
	   Bubka, 34, the only track and field athlete to win six straight
world championship gold medals, set the world record of 6.14 meters
at Sestriere, Italy, in 1994.
	   Jeff Hartwig of the United States won the pole vault at 5.90,
just 10 centimeters off his world seasonal best this summer.
	   Frankie Fredericks, a two-time Olympic silver medalist from
Namibia, clocked 9.95 seconds in edging world champion Maurice
Greene of the United States by .01 in the men's 100.
	   Frederick's winning time extended his record total of legal
sub-10-second marks to 21. Carl Lewis is second (15).
	   The Bislett Games was the opening meet of the new Golden League,
which also counts toward the established Grand Prix competition and
offers dlrs one million for anyone who can win at all six meets
plus the final.

International observers complete first mission amid lull in combat

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ International officials push ahead
Friday with efforts to calm the crisis in Serbia's separatist
Kosovo province following the successful completion of the first
diplomatic observation mission to flashpoints in the region.
	   The multinational missions are to identify regions that require
further observation and determine the needs for humanitarian
support and displaced persons, John Freely, head of the U.S. team
told reporters Thursday. He said the mission traveled without
incident into regions previously sealed off to diplomats.
	   Clashes between Serb security forces and ethnic Albanian
militants have grown increasingly violent since late February,
killing hundreds of people and forcing thousands of others to flee.
Serbia and Montenegro make up the Yugoslav federation.
	   In Vienna, Austria, the Organization of Security and Cooperation
in Europe said Yugoslavia agreed to let an OSCE delegation visit
the country, including Kosovo, for about 10 days as part of
international efforts to end the conflict.
	   Yugoslavia has refused to accept OSCE mediation until its
membership in the 54-member organization is restored. Although the
Yugoslav agreement falls short of accepting OSCE mediation, U.S.
and European officials called the invitation a step in the right
direction.
	   The United States and the Europeans are trying to prevent
Kosovo's fighting from spreading to other Balkan countries with
substantial Albanian communities.
	   Speaking in the Macedonian capital Skopje late Thursday, German
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel urged the government to support
international officials' attempts to contain the crisis within
Kosovo's borders. Macedonia has its own sizable Albanian
population.
	   Montenegro's Commissioner for Refugees, the told independent
Montena-fax news agency Thursday a record number of refugees had
crossed the border Wednesday. An estimated 15,000 refugees, mostly
women and children, have fled Kosovo for shelter in Montenegro
since violence in May.

Hard-line Protestants test police lines at Drumcree
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Leaders of Northern Ireland's
new Assembly hope meetings with community leaders Friday will help
end the continuing violence sparked when authorities banned a
Protestant march through a Catholic neighborhood.
	   The Assembly's leader, Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble,
will join Seamus Mallon, the Catholic elected as deputy first
minister of the Assembly, in meeting with leaders of churches,
businesses, unions and community groups to promote compromise.
	   In a joint statement, they said an accommodation could be
reached if the two sides in the dispute showed ``vision, courage
and leadership.''
	   ``The body politic, the people on the ground, the whole system
in Northern Ireland cannot stand the strain that is being put on
it,'' Mallon said.
	   ``When you look at it ... in the most mercenary terms, 40
million pounds (dlrs 65 million) have been lost as a result of this
confrontation so far. Put that into perspective _ if people think
what 40 million is in terms schools, hospitals, care for the
elderly might do. And here we have it down the drain,'' Mallon
said.
	   On Thursday night, supporters of the thwarted Protestant
marchers hurled ball bearings from catapults and threw fireworks at
police. None of the officers was seriously injured, police said.
	   Tensions are expected to peak this weekend with the 12th of July
holiday, the annual Protestant jamboree celebrating the victory of
the Protestant King William of Orange over the Catholic King James
II at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690.
	   Leaders of the Protestant Orange Order say there is only one
solution: Their march must be allowed down the Garvaghy Road,
through a hostile Catholic neighborhood in Portadown, 25 miles (40
kms) southwest of Belfast.
	   The Catholics of Garvaghy Road, backed by Northern Ireland's
Parades Commission and by Prime Minister Tony Blair, insist that
the Orangemen will not be allowed to pass down the road.
	   Rev. John Dixon, moderator of the Presbyterian Church, Northern
Ireland's largest Protestant denomination, urged both sides to back
down.
	   ``Now is the time to free and empower men and women of goodwill
on both sides _ for I have no doubt there are such who are working
very strenuously to ensure that an accommodation can be reached and
this local problem will not continue to fester,'' Dixon said.
	   An estimated 20,000 Orangemen and supporters gathered at
Drumcree on Thursday night, the largest turnout since the march was
stopped on Sunday. Some alarmed Catholics put the numbers even
higher.
	   ``I don't think that by any stretch of the imagination anybody
should describe the massing of over 25,000 Orangemen on the edge of
this area as a peaceful protest,'' said Brid Rodgers, an Assembly
member from the Social Democratic and Labor Party, which gets the
largest share of Catholic votes in Northern Ireland.
	   ``People are becoming very concerned and very angry that this is
being presented as a peaceful demonstration,'' he said.
	   Protestant hard-liners across Northern Ireland again expressed
their rage by blocking roads and setting fires. In Londonderry,
police said a Protestant mob dragged two men and an 11-year-old boy
from a car and battered them. The boy was reported in stable
condition in a hospital.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Greg Smith, Australia's most recent
rugby coach before incumbent Rod Macqueen, has had surgery to
remove a brain tumor.
	   Smith stood down in October as officials moved towards sacking
him following a disappointing season.
	   A hospital spokesman at Sydney's Prince of Wales Private
Hospital said Smith, 48, was in a stable condition following
Wednesday's operation.
	   Smith, who had been complaining of severe headaches, was
admitted to hospital on Tuesday after doing an interview for a New

Commercial dairy cow cloning a year away, says scientist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMILTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Cloning dairy herds to reproduce
only top milk producers and maximize farm earnings could begin on a
commercial basis within a year, agricultural scientists said
Friday.
	   Dr. William Vivanco, an agricultural research scientist at the
Ruakura Research Center, which brings new technology up to
commercial speed, said scientists were already working on farms.
	   He said the technique for cloning multiple embryos from donor
cow eggs, sexing the embryo and implanting it in a recipient cow
could be ready for sale to farmers by August 1999.
	   The cost of such cloning would be about U.S. dlrs 150 (300 NZ
dollars) so the farmer could recoup the money and make a profit.
	   Vivanco could not say if his team would be first to
commercialize the technique, because ``the race is on'' around the
world.
	   The New Zealand dairy industry could earn an extra U.S. dlrs 20
million (40 million NZ dollars) a year when embryo cloning goes
commercial, he said.
	   The genetic gain potential for the industry from embryo cloning
and pre-selected sex implants in recipient cows was ``mind
boggling,'' he said.
	   The research team last year cloned healthy twin calves at their
facilities as part of the program.
	   Last week, Japanese researchers announced the birth of two
cloned calves, the first in the world cloned from an adult cow.

Crew defeats Fire 3-0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) _ Brian McBride, Stern John and Rob Smith
each scored Thursday night as the Columbus Crew beat Chicago 3-0,
snapping the Fire's winning streak at 11, one short of a Major
League Soccer record.
	   The Los Angeles Galaxy won 12 straight games to start the 1996
season.
	   McBride put the Crew up 3-0 in the 73rd minute on a spectacular
full-volley shot. McBride fought off a defender and put a shot past
Fire goalkeeper Scott Coufal with a flying kick from six yards out
off a cross by Andrew Gregor.
	   John opened the scoring eight minutes into the game by chasing
down a loose ball in the box after a crossing pass deflected off
two defenders. John sent a shot from nine yards out that hit off
the crossbar and went in. John is third in the MLS with 10 goals.
	   Rob Smith scored the first goal of his career to put Columbus up
2-0 in the 40th minute off assists by Ansil Elcock and Jason
Farrel.
	   Chicago's best scoring chances came off direct kicks by Lubos
Kubik. In the 41st minute Kubik bent a shot from 30 yards out
around a wall of defenders that Crew goalkeeper Juergen Sommer just
managed to push past the goal post. Kubik had a shot hit the
crossbar from 20 yards out in the 76th minute.
	   The Crew handed Chicago its worst defeat of the season despite
being outshot 16-11 and 7-5 in shots on goal.
	   Columbus (9-8) moved ahead of the New York MetroStars into
second place in the Eastern Division. Chicago (13-6) remained
second in the Western Conference behind Los Angeles.

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Gary Sheffield's two-run homer highlighted a
four-run first inning for Los Angeles, and the Dodgers went on to
pound the San Diego Padres 12-3 on Thursday.
	   Trenidad Hubbard added a two-run homer in the seventh, and Chan
Ho Park (8-5) limited the Padres to three hits in six innings. The
only run Park allowed was unearned, on Eric Karros' fielding error
in the fifth inning.
	   Eric Karros, Charles Johnson and Juan Castro added two RBIs
apiece for the Dodgers, who ended a three-game winning streak by
the National League West-leading Padres. Los Angeles is still a
distant 12 1/2 games off the pace.
	   The Dodgers battered Mark Langston (3-2) for six runs in 3 1-3
innings, his worst outing of the season
 &UR; Braves 6, Marlins 4 &QC; 
	   In Miami, Chipper Jones, Gerald Williams and Javy Lopez homered
to power Atlanta its ninth straight victory.
	   Jones hit a two-run homer in the first, Williams had a solo shot
in the fifth and Lopez reached the left-field upper deck with a
three-run blast in the sixth, all against Livan Hernandez (7-5).
	   Atlanta's winning streak is its longest since winning nine
straight heading into the 1995 All-Star break.
	   John Smoltz (6-2) went six innings for the victory, and Kerry
Ligtenberg pitched the ninth for his 10th save.

Brazil measures World Cup team against 1994 champions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   OZOIR-LA-FERRIERE, France (AP) _ Four years ago, Brazil won the
World Cup with a low-wattage team that relied on defense,
discipline and the inspiration of Romario and Bebeto.
	   Now they're trying again, this time with a more talented but
underachieving group that has produced the most proficient offense
and the worst defense of the Cup.
	   Which was better?
	   Coach Mario Zagallo, who was assistant to Carlos Alberto
Parreira in 1994, uses the ultimate yardstick.
	   ``The '94 team. They were world champions,'' he said. ``This one
hasn't won anything yet.''
	   By that measure, Brazil's final against France on Sunday is a
chance for Ronaldo and company to prove that dazzle and daring can
be every bit as efficient as the '94 defensive machine.
	   In style and philosophy, the teams are vastly different, but
many of the names are the same. The backbone of the team is
unchanged, with Taffarel, Aldair, Dunga and Bebeto. Ronaldo and
Cafu, reserves four years ago, are now starters.
	   In 1994, Brazilians were desperate to win the title that had
eluded them since 1970. Brilliant teams had lost the Cup through
overconfidence in their goal-scoring ability, so Parreira designed
tactics to tie opponents in knots. Then he looked for players to
fill the roles.
	   The defensive fortress he came up with had a solid back line and
another blockade in the midfield. The sector once ruled by artists
like Didi and Gerson now featured Mauro Silva, Dunga, Mazinho and
Zinho, a striker so limited by defensive duties that he was dubbed
``the floorwaxer,'' because he just went around in circles.
	   Romario and Bebeto handled the playmaking and scoring, and did
it well enough to win the Cup. Still, the boring 0-0 final against
Italy, decided in a penalty-kick shootout, was worthy of the
defense-first mindset.
	   Ronaldo, then a 17-year-old promise, recalls watching from the
bench.
	   ``Our trump card was the security of the defense,'' he said.
``The team was closed in back and marked very well. It was hard for
anyone to get free around Mauro Silva, Dunga, Jorginho and
Branco.''
	   That all changed when Zagallo took over. With a generation of
gifted strikers like Ronaldo, Denilson and Rivaldo, he redesigned
the team to stress offense and ``art-soccer.''
	   But in France, the team has failed to catch fire. While playing
well enough to win, Brazil hasn't been the juggernaut many
expected. And if its dramatic victories over Denmark and the
Netherlands provided some of the Cup's most gripping moments, the
team's shaky defense helped to make them close.
	   Through six games, Brazil has scored 14 goals and allowed seven,
tops in the Cup in either category and surpassing its totals in
1994.
	   For team captain Dunga, the two teams have distinct
personalities and virtues.
	   ``In 1994, defense was our strong suit,'' he said. ``Now, our
team is a killer. It's our nature to play on the attack. No matter
how we try to control it, it's impossible.''

	   OAKLAND, California (AP) _ Ivan Rodriguez singled in the
tie-breaking run in the ninth and John Burkett pitched eight strong
innings as the Texas Rangers beat the Oakland Athletics 4-1
Thursday.
	   Burkett (5-9), who lost his previous four decisions, allowed one
run on four hits and struck out five. John Wetteland finished for
his 23rd save.

 &UR; Yankees 2, Devil Rays 0
	   In St. Petersbyrg, Florida, Andy Pettitte pitched five-hit ball

built on baseball's best start in 96 years.

second inning as Pettitte (11-5) won his fifth straight decision.
He struck out eight and walked one.

World Cup: Cantor almost through tournament with voice intact
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOSH DUBOW &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Andres Cantor, the only U.S. announcer to call
every World Cup game _ and all 165 GOOOOOAAALS _ has made it
through the first 62 games with his voice intact.
	   But there have been a few shaky moments, especially during those
dramatic moments when his distinctive ``GOOOOOAAAL!'' call
frequently lasts longer than the delirious celebrations by the
scorers themselves.
	   ``I was very worried about losing my voice at the beginning when
we had three or four games a day,'' said Cantor, who took six
months of voice lessons to prepare for the 64-game tournament.
``Now the games are more spaced out, but they are also more intense
and when I get carried away with emotion I tend to lose my voice
and strain it more.''
	   Cantor spent the months leading up to the World Cup poring over
videotape and rosters to learn the 32 teams and more than 700
players in France. He didn't have much experience with teams like
Iran and Morocco in his 11 years at Univision.
	   But it is the voice lessons that proved most important,
especially when a player like Ronaldo gets in striking distance of
the goal: Yell from the gut, not the vocal cords.
	   Goal calls like Cantor's are commonplace throughout Latin
America, but he is one of the only announcers whose audience does
not share the same home team.
	   ``I do it for all sides,'' he said. ``The length depends on the
intensity of the match and how much breath I have.''
	   But even Cantor plays favorites, with only a few ``GOOOOOAAAL''
calls worthy of those minute-long bellows that truly test his
tireless pipes. Mexico's late second-round clinching goal against
Holland, its lone goal against Germany, and the tying score by
Cantor's native Argentina against England were the most memorable
calls.
	   ``There is so much at stake for the teams that I get carried
away,'' he said. ``My voice is thinning out a bit now, but I have a
couple of days to rest.''
	   Cantor's passion and the excitement for the tournament fire up
the Spanish-speaking audience and even drive many English speakers
to flip the channel to Univision from ESPN or ABC immediately after
a goal.
	   Most of America, however, is slow to embrace the game, with low
ratings. That is something that has bothered Cantor since he moved
to the United States 18 years ago, when the only soccer to watch
was the Los Angeles Aztecs of the NASL.
	   Since being hired by Univision in 1987, Cantor no longer had to
drive hundreds of kilometers to see games on closed-circuit
television. All the games he would ever want are there for him at
the Univision studio in Miami and at the World Cup studio in Paris.
	   ``This is always a thrill for me because I love soccer so
much,'' he said. ``To be able to call all 64 games is like doing 64
Super Bowls for me.''
	   The only thing missing so far: a memorable ``GOOOOOAAAL'' to end
the World Cup.

Hundreds of Tokyo school kids fall ill from summer smog: reports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A stagnant air pattern, oppressive summer heat and
urban pollution formed a smog cocktail over greater Tokyo which is
suspected of sickening hundreds of school children, local press
reports said Friday.
	   More than 300 children in Tokyo and neighboring Chiba
prefecture, or state, complained of headaches and itchy eyes
Thursday as the temperature soared above 35 degrees Celsius (95
degrees Fahrenheit), the reports said.
	   The sickness was allegedly caused by a thick layer of
photochemical smog which settled over the city and triggered a
hazard warning shortly after 11:00 a.m. (0200 GMT) Thursday, the
Mainichi newspaper reported.
	   At an elementary school in central Tokyo, dozens of students
were rushed by ambulance to a local hospital, reported the Yomiuri,
Japan's largest newspaper.
	   The last time smog was believed to have caused more than 100
illnesses in Tokyo was in 1984, the Asahi newspaper said.

Dollar rises in Tokyo, Japanese stocks mixed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with midday trading &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen Friday morning
amid uncertainty over the outlook for the sluggish Japanese economy
and the outcome of elections this Sunday. Tokyo stocks turned
mixed.
	   The dollar bought 141.35 yen at midday, up 1.11 yen from late
Thursday in Tokyo and also slightly above its late New York rate of
141.10 yen overnight.
	   Traders said the dollar advanced on worry Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto's government has not done enough to stimulate the economy
by failing to detail proposed tax cuts, traders said.
	   The dollar was also buoyed by concern economic reforms could be
delayed if Hashimoto's ruling party suffers a big loss in Sunday's
elections for the upper house of Parliament, they said.
	   Recent polls in Japanese newspapers showing Hashimoto's party
will be unlikely to fare well in the vote have weighed on the yen,
traders said.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, some blue chips were among early
gainers but trading remained subdued ahead of Sunday's elections,
dealers said.
	   The 225-issue benchmark Nikkei Stock Average gained 75.03
points, or 0.46 percent, to 16,521.98 points at the end of the
morning session. On Wednesday, the Nikkei index closed down 84.02
points, or 0.51 percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section lost 0.82 points, or 0.06 percent, to 1,261.46. The
TOPIX closed down 6.12 points, or 0.48 percent, the day before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.370 percent from Thursday's finish of
1.360 percent, driving its price down to 110.66 yen from 110.73
yen.

Summer bonuses for Japanese salaried workers up 0.39 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Reflecting the nation's slumping economy, the
summer bonuses of Japanese salaried workers rose a marginal 0.39
percent from last year, a major newspaper reported Friday.
	   The average bonus paid by companies in both the manufacturing
and non-manufacturing sectors totaled 757,755 yen (dlrs 5,374) per
worker, the Nihon Keizai business daily reported.
	   The newspaper obtained the results by surveying 1,327 major
Japanese companies.
	   This year's increase comes after a rise of 3.39 percent in the
summer of 1997 compared with the year before, the report said.
	   In Japan, bonuses are considered part of workers' salaries and a
similar winter bonus is paid in December. Their amount is
considered a barometer of the health of the overall economy.
	   Japan has been in the doldrums for most of this decade, beset by
a bad debt-ridden banking sector and weak consumer spending.
	   Last month the government announced that Japan suffered its
first full year of negative growth in over 20 years during fiscal
1997. In May, the number of jobless rose to a record high of 2.93
million people, while the unemployment rate remained at a record
4.1 percent.

Two Americans arrested for allegedly robbing Tokyo store
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A pair of United States citizens suspected of
robbing about 1.6 million yen (dlrs 11,338) from a shop in Tokyo
have been arrested, local police said Friday.
	   Taken into custody were Darnell Hopkins, 24, and Michael Anthony
Sheppard, 26, said a Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department
spokesman, who declined to be named.
	   Police did not release the names of the suspects' hometowns in
the United States.
	   Late Thursday, the two men allegedly broke into a shop which
specializes in exchanging cash for trinkets won by players of
``pachinko'' pinball, a popular type of gambling, and robbed the
proprietress of the cash.
	   A third suspect in the crime remains at large, police said.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Japanese television network provoked angry
protests from animal lovers after it aired a gourmet-food program
featuring a controversial dish: Stir-fried Bengal tiger,
Cantonese-style.
	   The endangered animal was served up to Japanese television stars
at a restaurant in Shanghai, China, in a segment of Fuji
Television's ``World Gourmet Trip,'' which aired Thursday night.
	   The World Wildlife Fund, an international animal protection
agency, called Fuji to point out that that trade in Bengal Tigers
is prohibited by the 142-nation Convention on International Trade
in Endangered Species.
	   ``The program shows absolutely no recognition of efforts to save
the Bengal tiger from extinction,'' Sakiko Takada, a WWF
spokeswoman in Tokyo, told the Associated Press on Friday.
	   There remain between 3,030 and 4,730 Bengal tigers left in the
wild, according to WWF statistics.
	   Other viewers also called the network to protest, saying the
program was ``in bad taste.''
	   But Fuji defended it, saying the tiger had not been killed
especially for the program. The network also said the animal had
died a year ago in a Chinese zoo and been preserved in the
restaurant's freezer.
	   ``We don't believe this program violated (the international
convention),'' Fuji said in a terse statement.
	   But it did make a concession to the sensibilities of the
protesters, adding: ``We will be careful to consider the feelings
of animal lovers in the future.''
	   Also, Fuji spokesman Seitaro Murao explained that Bengal tiger
isn't on the featured restaurant's menu, but that customers can
request it if the establishment happens to have the meat in stock.
	   Fuji's ``World Gourmet Trip'' is one of the ubiquitous food and
travel programs on Japanese television, in which celebrities travel

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ President-elect Andres Pastrana said he
met with the leader of Colombia's oldest and most powerful leftist
rebel group, in a dramatic announcement heightening expectations of
an end to Colombia's 34-year civil war.
	   ``I want to announce to the country and the international
community that today I met in a location on Colombian territory
with Manuel Marulanda and Jorge Briceno,'' Pastrana said Thursday.
	   Marulanda is a top leader and Briceno a ranking military
commander of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.
	   Pastrana, who is set to take office in August, declined to
disclose the exact location of his meeting with Marulanda and
Briceno.
	   It was the first-ever meeting between an elected or sitting
president and rebel leaders on Colombian soil.
	   Pastrana showed a 45-second video in which he is seen in jeans
and a collared shirt embracing the camouflaged rebel leaders.
	   He said peace talks would begin during the first 90 days of his
government and _ conceding to a longstanding rebel demand _ would
be preceded by the withdrawal of army troops from five towns in
guerrilla-contested territory.
	   Pastrana vowed to seek a ``stable and lasting peace,'' and said
FARC leaders characterized the meeting as ``historic.''
	   The rebels could not be reached for comment.
	   News of the clandestine encounter comes before meetings begin
Sunday in Germany between Colombian civic leaders and
representatives of the 5,000-member National Liberation Army,
Colombia's second-largest guerrilla group.
	   Those talks are meant to pave the way for direct negotiations
with Pastrana, but political analysts had warned against inflated
peace expectations, in part because the Germany meetings do not
include FARC.
	   The 15,000-member FARC, which increasingly finances its
operations by protecting cocaine traffickers in the southern
coca-growing regions, has scored military victories over the past
two years against an ill-equipped and dispirited 120,000-member
army.
	   FARC refused to negotiate with outgoing President Ernesto
Samper, calling his government illegitimate due to allegations
Samper's campaign received millions of dollars from drug
traffickers.
	   Rebels have previously said they will only talk peace if the
government dismantles right-wing paramilitary groups who have
committed dozens of massacres of civilians suspected of supporting
the rebels.

Expelled Russian diplomat leaves Seoul
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A Russian diplomat, expelled by South
Korea on spy charges, left for home Friday amid indications that
Moscow might escalate the diplomatic spat.
	   Oleg N. Abramkin, one of six councilors at the Russian Embassy
in Seoul, was declared persona non grata Wednesday and given three
days to leave the country.
	   Abramkin's expulsion was Seoul's tit-for-tat response to
Moscow's expulsion of a South Korean diplomat a week ago. Russia
said Thursday it was considering further retaliatory action.
	   South Korea's Foreign Ministry said Abramkin had engaged in
``activities that go against his status as a diplomat,'' a common
diplomatic euphemism for spying.
	   ``The Korean side has chosen to further exacerbate the
situation, and now it's our turn to make a move,'' said Russian
Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin. He called Abramkin's
expulsion ``unwarranted.''
	   He added that Moscow was considering whether to accept South
Korea's proposal to hold a meeting between both nations' foreign
ministers to discuss the matter.
	   The dispute started last Friday, when Russia's Federal Security
Service detained Cho Sung-woo, a political officer at South Korea's
embassy, after he allegedly received classified data from a Russian
contact.
	   The Federal Security Service, a successor of the Soviet-era KGB,
identified Cho's Russian contact as Valentin Moiseyev, a deputy
chief of the Foreign Ministry's First Asian Department, which deals
with both North and South Korea as well as China and Mongolia.
	   South Korean media, reporting from Moscow, said Moiseyev, who
once worked as a newspaper reporter and then later a trade official
in North Korea, is expected to be charged with high treason.
	   The old Soviet Union, a longtime ally of communist North Korea,
opened formal diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1990.
	   Trade and other relations between Russia and South Korea have
since developed significantly, while Moscow's relations with North
Korea have cooled considerably.

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The secretary of a former Mexican prosecutor
accused of ties to drug smugglers has been extradited to Mexico a
day after she was arrested in Costa Rica.
	   Mexico had requested the extradition of Maria Dolores Mota Rubio
on charges she diverted government funds and committed fraud during
her work as personal secretary to Deputy Attorney General Mario
Ruiz Massieu.
	   Ruiz Massieu, who is under house arrest in the state of New
Jersey while the United States considers his extradition to Mexico
for alleged money laundering and drug smuggling, is the brother of
Francisco Ruiz Massieu, the assassinated secretary-general of
Mexico's ruling party.
	   Ruiz Massieu allegedly had Mota Rubio divert public money to
bank accounts to which only he had access.
	   Mota Rubio, who had been living in Costa Rica since March 1995,
was returned to Mexico aboard a Mexican government plane Thursday
evening, the government news agency Notimex reported. She then was
escorted to offices of the federal Attorney General.
