<HEADLINE> Ancient Graves Unearthed in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 24 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi archaeological team has
unearthed a number of ancient graves at Al-Musaihley village in the
northern Neiveva province, a report said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ancient graves date back to around 4,500 B.C., displaying
the long-standing ancient civilization of Iraq, according to Rabee
Al-Qaisi, general director of the Department of Archaeology and
Antiques subordinate to the Iraqi Ministry of Culture and
Information.
</P>
<P>
But the report did not say what the archaeologists found inside
the graves.
</P>
<P>
The graves were first found by farmers while they ploughed
fields near the Al-Musaihley village, said the report.
</P>
<P>
In Iraq, there are a lot of cultural and archaeological relics
that record Mesopotamia's history of more than 9,000 years.
</P>
<P>
However, archaeology of Iraq has been hit hard by the decade-old
U.N. sanctions due to severe shortage of funds as well as rampant
smuggling that has plagued the country for years.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under sweeping U.N. sanctions ever since its 1990
invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Iranian DM in Saudi Arabia on Security Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Defense Minister Ali
Shamkhani arrived in the western port city of Jeddah Monday on a
visit aimed to forge defense and security cooperation between the
two Gulf countries.
</P>
<P>
Shamkhani, the first Iranian defense minister to visit Riyadh in
21 years, is to hold talks with Saudi Second Deputy Prime Minister
and Defense and Aviation Minister Prince Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Saudi Okaz newspaper published on Sunday,
the Iranian defense chief said the meeting would center on the
process of working out a joint security mechanism, which Iran has
been calling for over the past years.
</P>
<P>
He added that the two sides are designed to discuss the
possibility of reaching a comprehensive accord to resolve the
outstanding issues that are considered as threats to the regional
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi cabinet decided last Monday to start negotiations with
Iran on an agreement on combating drug trafficking, terrorism and
organized crime.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the political issues, Shamkhani said his meeting with
Prince Sultan will cover the latest developments in the region and
worldwide, as well as bilateral relations between the two states.
</P>
<P>
Shamkhani's visit is seen as the last phase in the comprehensive
Iranian-Saudi rapprochement process, in which political ties are
steadily improved, oil policies coordinated and security
cooperation discussed.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Saudi Arabia were once in mistrust and discord for
nearly two decades because of Tehran's policy of exporting its
Islamic Revolution ideology. The 1979 Islamic Revolution toppled
the late shah's regime and brought about the clergymen's rule.
</P>
<P>
Tehran and Riyadh began to ease tension and re-build mutual
trust after Iran's moderate President Mohmmad Khatami took office
in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
The past years have witnessed a constant warming-up of relations
between Iran and Saudi Arabia, as a number high-level visits were
exchanged.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Crown Prince and First Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ibn
Abdul-Aziz went to Tehran to attend the summit of Organization of
the Islamic Conference (OIC) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Iran's former President Hashmi Rafsanjani spent 14 days in Saudi
Arabia in February 1998 to "thaw ice" and coordinate oil policy.
</P>
<P>
President Khatami made a landmark visit to Riyadh last May,
crowning efforts by the two sides to bring back on track the once-
suspended ties.

<HEADLINE> Cash Injection Ordered to Ease Egyptian Currency Liquidity Lack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
ordered the government on Monday to ease a shortage of local
currency by injecting around 25 billion Egyptian pounds (7.25
billion U.S. dollars) into the market in eight months.
</P>
<P>
The cash injection will take the form of immediate payment of
government debts to public and private companies, Information
Minister Safwat el-Sharif told reporters after a meeting between
Mubarak, Prime Minister Atef Obeid and economic sector ministers.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been suffering from liquidity problems for several
months, combined with economic stagnation which has made it
difficult to sell stocks of industrial and food products,
government newspapers have reported.
</P>
<P>
The president ordered the money to be repaid at a minimum
monthly rate of 2.5 billion pounds (725 million dollars) over a
maximum time period of eight months starting in May, el-Sharif
added.
</P>
<P>
He did not specify where the money would come from but said the
funds would be drawn from "real resources."
</P>
<P>
Minister of Economy and Foreign Trade Youssef Boutros Ghali said
at the weekend that such a move would be partly financed from
central bank assets.
</P>
<P>
The state has accumulated large debts with construction
companies and the national electricity company largely from
financing mega projects such as the Toshka land reclamation in
southern Egypt which aims to irrigate desert land with water from
the Nile.

<HEADLINE> Russian Missile Hits Ukrainian Ship, Five Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A cruise missile launched from a
Russian coastal missile complex from Cape Khersones in Sevastopol
in the Black Sea accidentally struck a Ukrainian passenger ship
Monday,injuring five people.
</P>
<P>
The accident happened during the Russian Black Sea Fleet
exercises about 48 kilometers from Donuzlav in the Crimea, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Progress missile reportedly hit the "Vereshchagin" ship
above the waterline, wounding five people. One of the victims, a
crewmember,sustained serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the accident is still under investigation, but
preliminary reports said the Ukrainian vessel inadvertently
entered the training area, which had been closed to navigation by
the Black Sea Fleet.
</P>
<P>
Monday's incident was the second that involved a Russian
missile within a week.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, a Strizh-3 rocket launched from within Russia
landed in Atyrau region, west Kazakhstan, creating a crater about
five meters across and 2.5 meters deep. Rocket fragments were
scattered over a distance of 50-60 meters around the crater,
Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Nobody was hurt in the incident, but it prompted the Kazakh
Foreign Minister Yerlan Idrisov to consider demanding Moscow
refrain from rocket launches from the Russian air defense test
site in Ashuluk.
</P>
<P>
"This is an unpleasant case. The worst thing about it is that
people could have been hurt," Idrisov said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have set up a joint team to look into details
of the incident, he added.

<HEADLINE> White House Blames Elian's Relatives For Forceful Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart Monday blamed Elian Gonzalez's relatives for the forceful
seizure of the Cuban boy by the government.
</P>
<P>
This would not happen if Elian's relatives had respected the
law and allowed him to be reunited with his father, Lockhart said
at a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton felt the raid was "the right thing to do and
was the only alternative remaining," Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
"All of this could have been avoided. None of this had to
happen. This happened because the family did not respect the legal
process here that dictated the father should be reunited with the
young boy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Janet Reno also defended the government's
actions, saying "I have no regrets whatsoever."
</P>
<P>
"I tried my level best to make sure we avoided this situation,"
she said on NBC's "Today". "I'm satisfied with the result."
</P>
<P>
Armed federal agents broke into the Miami home of Elian's
relatives early Saturday and snatched the 6-year-old boy for
reunion with his Cuban father after negotiations between the
government and his relatives failed.
</P>
<P>
Elian and his father are staying at Andrews Air Force Base
outside Washington. Some of their Cuban relatives tried to meet
with the boy, but did not succeed so far.
</P>
<P>
"I will not leave until I see this boy," Marisleysis Gonzalez,
ELian's cousin said at a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
Elian was rescued on November 25 of last year near a shipwreck
in the Atlantic sea off Florida after his mother and 10 others
were drowned when their immigrant smuggling boat capsized. Elian
stayed in the house of his Miami relatives until he was snatched
by federal agents.

<HEADLINE> Ice, Human Error Blamed for Russian Air Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Russian investigators have blamed
ice buildup and a crew error for the crash of Yak-40 aircraft on
March 9 that killed nine people, the Interfax news agency reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The small airliner, heading for Kiev, dropped from the sky soon
after take-off at Moscow's Sheremetyevo-1 airport.
</P>
<P>
The Interstate Aviation Committee (MAK), which analyzed the
plane's"black box" recordings, and the Air Force Research
Institute, which examined fragments of the plane, reached the
conclusion that ice buildup and crew error had caused the accident,
Interfax quoted MAK Chairman Rudolf Teimurazov as saying.
</P>
<P>
After checking the pre-flight operations at Sheremetyevo before
the accident, the investigators discovered that the ill-fated Yak-
40 was among several aircraft that had not been de-iced. This was
considered the main cause of the crash.
</P>
<P>
The human error committed by the crew was that the jet's flaps
only elevated 10 degrees during the take-off, instead of the
normal 20.

<P>
ABUJA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Health experts from African
countries and international organizations met in Nigeria's
capital on Monday to prepare for the African Summit on Roll Back
Malaria, which is to be held here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The expert session reviewed malaria occurrence in Africa,
evaluated previous preventative measures and made proposals on
future intervention policies to be discussed at the forthcoming
summit.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting, Nigerian Health Minister Tim Menakaya
challenged the experts to find ways out of the upsurge of malaria
in some parts of the world, where the deadly disease was once
considered to have been eradicated.
</P>
<P>
He also asked the experts to deal with the drug resistant
strains in some other areas.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 African heads of state, health ministers and
leaders of international organizations are expected to attend
Tuesday's summit, according to a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
The summit is to be co-sponsored by the Nigerian government and
such international agencies as the World Health Organization
(WHO), the United Nations Children's Fund, the United Nations
Development Fund and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
As one of the most deadly diseases, malaria kills one child
every 30 seconds in the world, with most of them in Africa,
according to statistics by the WHO.

<HEADLINE> Talks on Cyprus Should Be Substantive: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
has reiterated that the third round of U.N.-sponsored proximity
talks on Cyprus should be substantive, government spokesman
Michalis Papapetrou said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
There is no need for inviting the two sides to make further
clarifications on clarifications already made, Papapetrou told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"The key to the success of the third round of proximity talks
and the general effort for a solution to the Cyprus problem is in
Ankara," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded and occupied the
northern third of the Mediterranean island after a failed pro-
Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been pushing for reunification of Cyprus under a
bicommunal, bizonal federation formula, but all efforts have so for
failed.
</P>
<P>
Clerides, leader of the Greek Cypriots, and Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash have held two rounds of proximity talks on
Cyprus, the first in New York last December and the second in
Geneva in February.
</P>
<P>
The talks, under the auspices of U.N., were aimed at preparing
the ground for substantive talks which may lead to a comprehensive
settlement of the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the two sides have already put forward their
positions on the Cyprus issue and given their clarifications.
</P>
<P>
The third round of talks is scheduled to start on May 23 in New
York.
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou said the forthcoming meeting in the U.S. between
Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou and his Turkish
counterpart Ismail Cem is important, noting that the Greek Cypriot
side hopes Ankara will be convinced to change its "intransigent
position" and persuade the Turkish Cypriot side to enter into
substantive talks.
</P>
<P>
If Ankara sticks to its intransigent position on Cyprus, "there
is no hope for breaking the deadlock," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Papandreou and Cem will go to New York on May 3 to
receive an award. Papandreou is expected to raise the Cyprus issue
during his meeting with Cem.
</P>
<P>
Backed by Ankara, the Turkish Cypriot side is seeking a
confederation of two "states" on the island.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Journalists Condemn Closure of Papers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Association of Journalists
on Monday condemned the closure of 12 reformist periodicals by the
conservative judiciary, which it said has caused tension in the
society.
</P>
<P>
"The judiciary's unprecedented move has created a wave of fear
and tension among the journalists and in the society," the Islamic
Republic News Agency quoted the organization as saying in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The press has acted as a powerful means in the Iranian political
scene and it has been targeted by those who wield power, the
statement read.
</P>
<P>
Despite so many hardships and problems, however, the community
of young journalists has won confidence of the people and, by so
doing, promoted the noble standing of the journalism in the
country, it stated.
</P>
<P>
The statement called on the judiciary to respect the law by
ending bans on the newspapers and allowing them to create a sound
atmosphere in the society for dialogue and debate.
</P>
<P>
The conservative judiciary ordered on Sunday night to close down
eight reformist dailies, three weeklies and a monthly, accusing
them of printing materials that disparaged Islam and the religious
principles of the Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
The unusual move came amid a mounting crackdown on reformist
press and spiraling power struggle between the conservative and
reformist camps since the reformists' landslide victory in February
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
A dozen journalists and publishers have been summoned to courts
and three journalists and publishers have been sent to prison on
charge of insulting Islamic sanctities and principles.

<P>
TEHRAN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Two more reformist newspapers,
Sobh-e Emrouz and Akhbar-e Eqtessad, were closed down on Monday,
following the closure of 12 reformist periodicals by the
conservative judiciary Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
An informed source with the Tehran justice administration said
orders have been issued to suspend the publication of the two pro-
reform dailies, according to the official Islamic Republic News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
Sobh-e Emrouz (This Morning) is published by Sayeed Hajjarian,
the prominent reformer who was shot and seriously injured last
month in an assassination attempt.
</P>
<P>
As a member of the Tehran municipal council and President
Mohammed Khatami's close adviser, Hajjarian played an important
role in the reformist victory in February's parliamentary
elections.
</P>
<P>
The conservative judiciary ordered Sunday night to close down
eight reformist dailies, three weeklies and a monthly, accusing
them of printing materials that disparaged Islam and religious
principles of the Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
The closure of so many reformist publications came amid a

between the conservative and reformist camps since the reformists'

</P>
<P>
A dozen journalists and publishers have been summoned to courts
and three journalists and publishers have been sent to prison on
charge of insulting the Islamic sanctities and principles.
</P>
<P>
The closure of papers has invited condemnation from many
circles, including the Association of Journalists and the Islamic
Human Rights Commission, which termed the judiciary's act as
violating the press freedom stipulated in the constitution.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Urges Doubled Efforts to Combat Nuclear Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Monday called on all parties to the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) to redouble their
efforts to combat the nuclear threat.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of the 2000 Review Conference
of the Parties to the Treaty of NPT, Annan said, "We meet to seek
progress on a question of vital significance to our common future:
how to fulfill the promise of non-proliferation and disarmament
embodied in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty."
</P>
<P>
"In the first year of the new millennium, the NPT is needed
more than ever. However, it stands today as a paradox. The fact
that 187 states are parties to this treaty testifies to its global
appeal. And yet no one can be satisfied with the degree of
implementation so far," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"Former nuclear rivals are now cooperating to reduce threats
posed by their weapons. Nuclear safeguards have been strengthened,
memberships in nuclear-weapon-free zones have grown. A
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was negotiated, and though the
treaty is not yet in force, and de facto moratorium on testing is
continuing," the Secretary-General continued.
</P>
<P>
"This is an unmistakable record of achievement and hard-won
progress. However, this is no time for complacency when it comes
to the threat of nuclear war. Nuclear conflict remains a very real,
and very terrifying possibility at the beginning of the 21st
century," Annan noted.
</P>
<P>
"The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, including
nuclear weapons, remains a major threat to peace, and a major
challenge to every Member State. The fact is that compliance with
the NPT's non-proliferation obligations remains incomplete and has
not always been satisfactory," he said.
</P>
<P>
 "We are also facing major challenges in fulfilling the
disarmament aims of the NPT. Some 35,000 nuclear weapons remain in
the arsenals of the nuclear powers, with thousands still deployed
on hair-trigger alert. There have been no nuclear disarmament
negotiations for many years concerning strategic or tactical
nuclear weapons," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. chief criticized the United States by not mentioning
its name for deploying national missile defenses, which could lead
to a new arms race, setbacks for nuclear disarmament and non-
proliferation, and create new incentives for missile proliferation.
</P>
<P>
The 2000 NPT Review Conference, which will be held from
April 24 to May 19, is the first to meet following the Treaty's
indefinite extension at the 1995 Conference.
</P>
<P>
 States parties will examine the implementation of the Treaty'
s provisions since 1995, taking into account the decisions on the
principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and
disarmament and the strengthening of the review process for the
Treaty.

<P>
PARIS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac had
a telephone conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak on
Monday, which came on the eve of the visits to Paris by Syrian
Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
French officials at the Elysee presidential palace said that
the conversation between Chirac and Barak was focused on the
pullout of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon scheduled to be

<HEADLINE> Ireland Hopes to Restore Home Rule In Northern Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern
said in Dulin on Monday that he wanted to see home rule restored
to Northern Ireland as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"It is my determination, which I believe is widely shared,that
the (Good Friday) Agreement will become fully operational again
with the shortest possible delay," a Reuters report quoted Ahern
as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We are consulting closely with the British government and the
pro-Agreement parties to achieve this," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ahern made the remarks while addressing his Fianna Fail party's
annual commemoration of the 1916 Easter rising against British
rule.The rebellion broke out 84 years ago to the day on Easter
Monday, April 24, 1916.
</P>
<P>
The Good Friday Agreement, signed in 1998, was the blueprint
for efforts to end 30 years of sectarian strife between pro-
British Protestants and republican Roman Catholics in Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
But the peace process has stalled over lack of progress on
disarmament by Irish Republican Army (IRA) guerrillas, which led
Britain to suspend a power-sharing assembly in Northern Ireland in
last February.
</P>
<P>
Ahern met British Prime Minister Tony Blair twice last week and
the two governments are expected to make a major push in the
coming weeks to break the political stalemate in the province.

<HEADLINE> UK Prime Minister In Crisis Talks With Ford Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
has held secret talks with the chief executive of carmaker Ford in
a bid to persuade the company not to end car assembly at its
Dagenham plant.
</P>
<P>
Blair met Ford's global chief executive Jac Nasser to discuss
the future of the east London plant which is threatened with
closure because of over-capacity and problems caused by the strong
pound, it is revealed Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ford has focused on reducing its European car production
capacity after the company reported losses of 72 million pounds on
its overseas operations in the first three months of the year.
</P>
<P>
The UK government fears ending assembly of cars at the plant
will anger unions and spark a wave of strikes that could provoke
Ford into even more drastic cuts in its operations throughout
Britain.
</P>
<P>
Ford is expected to announce its restructuring in the next few
weeks, including the end of car production at Dagenham, with the
loss of 3000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
Blair, desperate to avoid a repeat of the political fallout
from BMW's decision to pull out of the Rover plant at Longbridge,
has also been in frequent telephone contact with Nick Scheele, the
chairman of Ford Europe.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister's intervention signals a high political
priority to stemming job losses in the manufacturing industry,
which has suffered because of the pound's strength abroad.
</P>
<P>
It has announced a global review of its operations, and there
are fears that Dagenham has been identified for closure in a
restructuring plan to be announced in May.

<P>
MOSCOW, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Thirteen Russian servicemen were
killed and six wounded Sunday in a rebel ambush in southern
Chechnya,a top Russian general in the breakaway Republic of
Chechnya said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Four of the 22 vehicles of a Russian military convoy were
destroyed in the attack near the village of Serzhen-Yurt, Gennady
Troshev,commander of the federal forces in Chechnya, told a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the federal troops, with air and artillery
escorts, had taken precautions and acted professionally and
thereby minimized losses.
</P>
<P>
"The commanders cannot be reproached for this. The servicemen
acted in full accordance with the rules and the (Chechen) fighters
were properly repulsed," the Interfax news agency quoted Troshev
as saying..
</P>
<P>
A group of 80 to 100 rebels led by an Arab assaulted the convoy
along its entire length and from both sides, Troshev said.
</P>
<P>
The battle lasted two hours and some of the rebels "were
eliminated, some were scattered and 11 more were taken prisoner,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Russian federal troops had encountered increased rebel ambushes
in Chechnya since early March. In two attacks last month, 69 elite
policemen from Moscow and Perm were killed.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Monday criticized the
United States, the European Union and a number of other states
that did not support a resolution on human rights and terrorism
passed at the Geneva session of the U.N. Commission on Human
Rights.
</P>
<P>
Moscow "has taken notice of the fact that all EU countries,
Canada,Norway and a number of East European members of the
Commission including the Czech Republic, Latvia, Poland and
Romania voted down the draft resolution on human rights and
terrorism, and the United States abstained," the Russian Foreign
Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"We think such a move creates doubt regarding the sincerity of
their statements on the unconditional denouncement of terrorism,"
the Interfax news agency quoted the statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
The session passed the resolution on human rights and terrorism,
which was co- authored by Russia, and the resolution on hostage
taking initiated by Russia.
</P>
<P>
The resolutions urge countries to make sure that asylum seekers
have not taken part in terrorist acts before granting them refugee
status, the statement noted.
</P>
<P>
Russia hopes that "the countries in which terrorists from
Chechnya have found refuge will revise their policy and extradite
the criminals to the Russian police," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Human Rights Commission Protests Closure of Papers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of Iran's Islamic Human
Rights Commission Mohammad Hossein Ziaeefar on Monday protested
against the closure of 12 reformist publications and urged the
authorities to deal with press violations according to laws.
</P>
<P>
Press violation cases should be examined in the press court in
presence of the jury, and such a court hearing on press violations
should be open, Ziaeefar said in reaction to an order by the
conservative judiciary Sunday night to close down eight reformist
dailies, three weeklies and a monthly.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Justice Department said at midnight that those
publications were shut down for printing materials that disparaged
Islam and the religious principles of the Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Ziaeefar underlined that the country's constitution has
stipulated press freedom, and respecting press freedom is in fact
respecting human rights, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Disregard to the stipulations of the constitution would be
interpreted as violation of human rights," the human rights
official said, adding that the 1985 press law prohibits exerting
pressure on the press and any attempt to carry out censorship.
</P>
<P>
Ziaeefar warned that the ban on several papers would damage
Iran's image, calling for contemplation in dealing with the matter.
</P>
<P>
The unusual closure of 12 reformist publications came amid
mounting crackdown by the conservatives on reformist press, and
spiraling power struggle between the conservative and reformist
camps since the reformists won a landslide victory in the February
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
A dozen of reformist journalists and publishers have been
summoned to courts and three journalists and publishers have been
sent to prison on charge of insulting the Islamic sanctities and
principles.
</P>
<P>
The outgoing conservative Majlis (parliament), which will end
work on May 28, recently passed an amendment to the press law
imposing more restrictions on the pro-reformist press. But the
amendment should first be passed by the Guardians Council before
becoming law.

<HEADLINE> Barak, Chirac Discuss Israel's Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak phoned French President Jacques Chirac on Monday and
discussed with him Israel's planned troops withdrawal from south
Lebanon, the Prime Minister's Office said.
</P>
<P>
The office did not give details about the telephone
conversation, but said it is important for Barak to inform the
French leader about the upcoming withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
France has already expressed its willingness to send peace-
keeping forces to south Lebanon after Israel's pullout.
</P>
<P>
Barak promised to withdraw the Israeli troops from the so-called
security zone in south Lebanon by July, and the Israeli government
has already informed U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan of this
decision last Monday.
</P>
<P>
Annan welcomed Barak's decision, saying the United Nations will
do everything possible to help Israel's withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Barak also decided that no Israeli military outposts will be
left inside the security zone after Israel's pullout.
</P>
<P>
However, the unilateral Israeli withdrawal was opposed by both
Lebanon and Syria, which they said would cause instability and even
war in the region.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and its main power broker Syria insisted that an Israeli
pullout from south Lebanon should be done within the framework of a
peace deal that includes Israel's return of the Golan Heights to
Syria.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security establishment warned again on Monday that the
Lebanese guerrilla group Hezbollah and Palestinians in Lebanon may
join hands to conduct "terrorist attacks" against Israel after
Israel's withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out the border strip in south Lebanon in 1985
after two invasions, with the self-proclaimed purpose of protecting
its northern security.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, backed by Syrian and Iran, has been
fighting to end Israeli occupation in the area.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Calls for Calm, Solidarity Amid Spiraling Struggles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
here on Monday called for calm and solidarity as factional power
struggles in the country reached a new peak following a crackdown
on reformist press by the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
"Iran today, more than ever, needs calm and solidarity to
achieve its goals, today, we need tranquility, especially at the
start of a new Majlis (parliament)," Khatami said at a military
parade to mark the 20th anniversary of a failed U.S. attempt to
free American hostages.
</P>
<P>
"With the approach of the closing days of the 5th Majlis, all
are getting prepared to march towards a brighter future through the
establishment of a popular, faithful and benevolent Majlis," he
said at a ceremony at Tehran Azadi Square also marking the Army
Day.
</P>
<P>
Iranian students took over the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held
its staff as hostages for 444 days in the heyday of the 1979
Islamic revolution. The U.S. failed to rescue the hostages when
several helicopters crashed in the desert near the eastern city of
Tabas.
</P>
<P>
Khatami expressed hope for closer solidarity and cooperation
between the new reformist parliament and the government, the armed
forces and people and among all segments of the system, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said that security, calm and solidarity are the prerequisites
for the smooth transition of the parliament at the end of May from
the powerful conservatives to the reformists, who won a landslide
victory in the February parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
The already white-hot powerful struggle between the
conservatives, who dominate most of the state organs and the newly-
grown reformists, the main allies of President Khatami, reached a
new peak in recent days as the conservatives launched desperate
efforts to crack down on the reformist media.
</P>
<P>
The conservative judiciary on Sunday night ordered the closure
of 12 reformist publications in an unprecedented move in the
history of the Islamic regime. A number of reformist journalists
and publishers have already been sent to prison on charge of
defaming the Islamic sanctities and principles.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said that the magnificent presence of people in all
scenes, especially in the February parliamentary elections,
demonstrated dynamism of the nation.
</P>
<P>
However, the powerful conservatives suffered a series of
humiliating setbacks in the elections during the past two years,
particularly in the February parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
They accused the reformists of advocating the U.S.-style reforms
in Iran, which would threaten the Islamic regime and was strongly
rejected by the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
However, the reformists vowed to defend the reform process
initiated by President Khatami after he came to power in 1997 and
criticized the conservatives for trying to prevent the formation of
the reformist parliament and undermining Khatami's reform programs.
</P>
<P>
Following Khatami's speech, various units of the armed forces
paraded at the square with modern equipment, including self-made
tanks and missiles.
</P>
<P>
In the course of the ceremony, a U.S. flag was set ablaze by a
group of people who were prevented by security forces from burning
more.

DHAKA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait is expected to extend a loan
of 40 million U.S. dollars to finance the foreign exchange

<HEADLINE> Babytalk Contains Clues to The Earliest Words </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some of the most persistent sounds found in languages happen to
be very easy for babies to make, and that is no accident, reported
Peter MacNeilage and Barbara Davis in the latest issue of Science.
</P>
<P>
The two researchers of the University of Texas in Austin
analyzed the pattern of babbling and first words of babies from a
variety of counties, including the Untied States, France, Sweden
and Japan.
</P>
<P>
They found four distinct patterns of consonant/vowel
combinations common to all the babies that appear to be created by
the basic movements of the mouth and jaw during speech.
</P>
<P>
Those same patterns are found in the structure of "proto-words"
- hypothetical original words that linguists have reconstructed by
comparing modern languages.
</P>
<P>
"The first words of human ancestors were like the first words
of modern infants," said Davis, "We believe the first ancestral
speakers were using basic mechanical patterns to form spoken words.

<HEADLINE> No Evidence of Church Abnormality in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 24 (Xinhua) -- South African police said
Monday they found no evidence that the worshipers of a church had
allegedly shut themselves off from the outside world to await
"Judgement Day".
</P>
<P>
Police Superintendent Tanduxolo Mthadu told South African Press
 Association that he had visited the church in Mandela Squatter
Camp, Umtata, East Cape Province, after a media report that people
had been encouraged to stop working and forbid their children to
go to school in preparation for the arrival of Jesus, sparking
concerns of mass suicide.
</P>
<P>
"When we arrived there we found people washing clothes and
doing housework," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There was no evidence of tension or any indication that people
were being kept there against their will. They said they go to
work during the day and return in the evening," he added.
</P>
<P>
The church consists of a homestead surrounded by a collection
of small houses and the leader of the sect Nokulunga Fiphaza said
on Sunday that the church had no name as it belonged to God.
</P>
<P>
Mthadu said the church has been operating since 1997 and is
well-known in the area.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that police will continue to monitor the
situation at the camp.

<HEADLINE> New Research Sheds Light on Greek Remains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- New research has concluded
that the remains unearthed from a Greek tomb in 1997 are not those
of King Philip II, the father of Alexander the Great, and Philip's
wife.
</P>
<P>
Instead, they are more likely those of one of Alexander's half
brothers, Philip III Arrhidaeus, and his wife, much less prominent
figures in the royal lineage of ancient Greece, according to a
report in the latest issue of Science.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, archaeologists uncovered a tomb, which contained the
remains of a cremated man and woman, in Greece's Vergina, the site
of the ancient Macedonian capital Aigai. Researchers at the time
identified the remains as those of King Philip II and his wife.
</P>
<P>
The find created excitement because during his reign from 359
to 336 B.C., Philip II consolidated power in Macedonia and took
control of Athens and Thebes, setting the stage for his famous son
to rule his vast empire.
</P>
<P>
The identification was based on certain features in the male
skull that appeared to be traces of an injury Philip suffered when
an arrow sliced through his right eye.
</P>
<P>
In a detailed reexamination of the remains, however,
anthropologist Antonis Bartsiokas of the Anaximandrian Institute
of Human Evolution in Greece concluded that the features are
instead anatomical quirks that were accentuated by the effects of
cremation and a faulty reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
This conclusion remains controversial. But if true, it may mean
that some of the artifacts found in the tomb, including a helmet
and ceremonial shield, may have belonged to Alexander the Great.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Golf Business to Grow 50 Percent This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's golf business is
expected to grow by 50 percent this year, bringing in overall
foreign exchange revenue of 10 billion baht (266.6 million U.S.
dollars), Thai Farmers Bank Research Center said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The research center was quoted by Thailand News Agency as
saying that the anticipated bright prospect of the golf business
should be attributed to close cooperation between the Tourism
Authority of Thailand (TAT) and Thai Airways International (THAI)
during the Amazing Thailand 1998-1999 period.
</P>
<P>
During that period, to promote tourist arrivals TAT made great
efforts in attracting foreign golfers to come to Thailand while
THAI and related private businesses helped in organizing golf
tours.
</P>
<P>
The center also cited 200 standard golf courses across the
country, well-trained caddies and cheaper service charge as the
reasons for the rapid growth of the golf business.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Many people in Harbin, capital of
northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, are becoming enthusiastic
about adopting Siberian tigers at the city's noted scenic spot
Taiyang Island.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Chengzhong, director in charge of the Siberian Tigers
Park on the island in the Songhua River, said that yesterday a
middle school student named Zhang Qingzhuo adopted a one-month-old
tiger.
</P>
<P>
The student used to visit the park and she liked Siberian
tigers very much. When she said she would like to "adopt" a tiger,
the park official accepted her donation.
</P>
<P>
Now, each year the girl will donate 500 yuan for the upkeep of
her adopted tiger named Zhuozhuo.
</P>
<P>
After the student's adoption, more than 200 people phoned the
park to express their interest in adopting other tigers, and about
50 of them registered to do just that.
</P>
<P>
The park occupies 360,000 sq.m. and is home to 70 tigers.
Zhang Chengzhong said the care of one tiger for a year takes about
30,000 yuan a year.

GUANGZHOU, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing 87th China Export
Commodity Fair in this capital of south China's Guangdong Province
is witnessing swift mine and metal products transactions.
</P>
<P>
Deals involving exports worth some 235 million US dollars were
sealed in the first five days of trading at the fair, which opened
on April 15.
</P>
<P>
This figure is 48 percent up from the same period of the
previous Spring session of the fair, signaling a resurgence of the
steel, iron, and non-ferrous metals market following a downturn
after the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Minmetal exports destined for the European Union worth 60
million US dollars accounts for 25 percent of the total, and those
to the U.S. and Japan increased by a large margin to 28 million US
dollars and 24.8 million US dollars, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Insiders say that export prices for minmetals saw an overall

NEW DELHI, April 24 (Xinhua) -- India Monday sought France's
cooperation in formulating a "united strategy" to combat terrorism
and expressed regret over what it called Pakistan's continued
defiance of international appeals to stop cross-border militancy,
the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported.

"Time has come for a concerted and united international
strategy to combat terrorism and wipe out the narco-terrorism
nexus," Indian Defense Minister George Fernandes was quoted as
saying at his talks with visiting French Chief of Defense Staff
General Jean Pierre Kelche here on Monday.

The Indian defense minister also emphasized the significance of
growing Indo-French defense cooperation and called upon the

<HEADLINE> Waves Threaten to Wash Away Lagos Beach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian environmental scientist
Ben Akpati on Monday warned that sea erosion caused by huge waves
may wash away major beach resort in Nigeria's largest city Lagos
in two years.
</P>
<P>
The News Agency of Nigeria quoted him as saying that with an
erosion rate of between 35 and 40 meters a year, the Bar beach in
the city's downtown Victoria Island would disappear in two years.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Nigerian government had spent about 1.5 billion
naira (15 million U.S. dollars) to prevent the beach from being
washed away.
</P>
<P>
Akpati, former director of the Nigerian Institute for
Oceanography and Marine Research (NIOMR), expressed
disappointment at the inability of successive federal
administration to find a permanent solution to the recurring
erosion.
</P>
<P>
"The best solution we have is that we must build break-waters.
We should have break-water systems and groins," he said, adding
that the cause of erosion on the beach is due to the action of sea
waves which originate from the southern tip of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The action of these waves along the Nigeria-Ghana, West
African coastline is very, very strong because of their long
fetch".
</P>
<P>
"We should build the break-waters about 200 meters off-shore
and parallel to the shore. The on-coming waves will smash on
these huge builders that will be placed on the sea-floor and
rising above the sea," he said, adding that the result would
diffuse the energy of the in-coming waves.
</P>
<P>
He traced the cause of the erosion to the construction of the
east and west moles (break-waters) between 1908 and 1912 to
stabilize the dredged deep entrance into the Lagos harbor.

JOHANNESBURG, April 24 (Xinhua) -- South African Department of
Foreign Affairs on Monday confirmed that two South Africans are
among the 21 people taken hostage by gunmen in Malaysia's famed
diving island of Sipadan.
</P>
<P>
The department's spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa told South African
Press Association that the identity of the man and the woman have
been known to the South African mission in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
"We know who they are and we are still trying to get hold of
their families before we release their names," he added.
</P>
<P>
Momoepa said the mission is involved in discussions with
Interpol.
</P>
<P>
"The government is doing everything in its power to secure the
release of these two people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sipadan is a world-renowned diving island off the northeast
coast of Sabah, the Malaysian side of Borneo Island, which is
shared with Indonesia.
</P>

GUANGZHOU, April 24 (Xinhua) -- "Keeping shoddy products out of

SHANGHAI, April 24 (Xinhua) -- New sea transportation routes
from Shanghai to Japan and the United States went into operation
today.
</P>
<P>
The route will be run every week, staring in Shanghai and
stopping at Yantian in south China's Guangdong Province, Hong Kong,

<HEADLINE> China's Consumer Spending to Grow Rapidly in Jan-June Period </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- According to the rate of consumer
spending in the first quarter this year, the State Administration
of Internal Trade (SAIT) forecasts continued rapid growth for the
first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Because of China's fast growing industry, smoothly operating
financial system, and deflation, retail sales volume for the first
three months is expected to hit 837.7 billion yuan, up 10.2
percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending is usually weak in the second quarter of a
year, but thanks to the recovery of the domestic and world
economic situation, both Chinese consumer spending and export
volume is expected to enjoy steady growth, said the SAIT.
</P>
<P>
The SAIT also said that retail sales volume would reach 770
billion yuan in the second quarter this year, up 7.7 percent over
the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
This means that China will realize 1.605 trillion yuan in
domestic consumer sales in the first six months of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Growth of consumer spending is expected to become evident in
household electrical appliances, personal computers,
telecommunications and clothing, as well as travel and education.
</P>
<P>
The situation of supply exceeding demand will not change much
in the first half this year, but considering the favorable
domestic and world economic situation and China's anticipated
entry into the WTO, China's price index is expected to rise during
this period.

<HEADLINE> (Profile) Laid-off Worker Helps Thousands Find Jobs (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Nine years ago, Dong Xin was laid
off from a shoe factory in Jiamusi City in northeastern China's
Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Now, Dong manages 12 employment agencies she has formed to aid
other laid-off workers, 200,000 of whom have found jobs with the
assistance of the agencies.
</P>
<P>
The Jiamusi city government has called Dong their "helping hand,
" and the people around her say she's a role model.
</P>
<P>
She will never forget the day of June 22, 1991, when she
learned she had lost her job. In the days after, the thirty-
something Dong lost her energy and enthusiasm, and she suffered
from insomnia, too worried about how she would earn a living to
sleep.
</P>
<P>
For three years she applied for work at government departments,
state-owned enterprises, and schools, but with no luck.
</P>
<P>
Her turnaround finally came after she lowered her expectations
and answered the call of a local neighborhood committee seeking
workers.
</P>
<P>
Though the wage was meager and working conditions poor, Dong
devoted herself to her job. Through her initiative, the
neighborhood committee set up a kindergarten for the children of
laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
In less than two years, there were five kindergartens and a
total of 26 laid-off workers had been re-employed as a result.
</P>
<P>
Dong was never a person to be content with her success. With an
increase in the number of laid-off workers, the idea came to her
that it might be a help to set up an employment agency, linking
the laid-off workers with those who need workers.

<P>
The idea proved to be successful, and in less than two weeks
the agency had found employment for over 30 workers in the city.
Soon, more and more people were flocking to her agency in the hope
of finding a job.
</P>
<P>
With her enormous pool of potential workers, Dong established
business contacts with all the employers in town, and the number
of her agencies expanded to over ten in the busiest parts of the
city.
</P>
<P>
In the process of helping the unemployed, Dong found that about
40 percent of the workers she introduced were turned down by
potential employers because they lacked appropriate skills.
</P>
<P>
To solve this problem, Dong set up a group of training courses
to teach those without jobs easy-to-learn, practical and
marketable skills, such as barbering, shoe repair, cooking, and
home appliance repairs. More than 400 laid-off workers were re-
employed as a result.
</P>
<P>
In the past several years, Dong has also been enthusiastically
involved in setting up community services agencies, which not only
facilitate the everyday life of local residents, but also provide
many jobs.
</P>
<P>
Dong's achievement in helping the laid-off workers has won her
the whole-hearted love and respect of the city people. She has
been granted the title of model worker by the city, the province,
and the central government.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Monday ordered the Philippine military forces to go after
the six armed pirates who reportedly kidnapped some 20 people,
mostly foreigners, in eastern Malaysia, a senior Philippine
official said.
</P>
<P>
In a press briefing, Press Secretary Ricardo Puno said the
Philippine embassy in Kuala Lumpur has received a note from the
assistant director of the Malaysian Police informing the
Philippines of the kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
The tourists were reportedly taken hostage late Sunday on a
remote resort island of Sipadan off the Sabah coast, eastern
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
But Puno, who is also the presidential spokesman, said initial
reports from the Philippine National Police could not confirm if
the pirates were Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
Citing the Malaysian police report, Puno said 10 of those
kidnapped were foreign tourists, which include French, German,
South African, Lebanese and Finnish nationals.
</P>
<P>
According the report, five staff members of the Sipadan resort,
and a Filipino, a Malaysian policeman and four staffers of the
Malaysian wildlife department, were also among the abducted.
</P>
<P>
Puno said the hostages were reportedly taken by boats heading
toward Philippine waters early Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
He added that President Estrada had given the instructions to
the Philippine Navy and the Philippine Air Force in support of the
border patrol agreement between the Philippines and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
"There is a border patrol agreement between the Philippines and
Malaysia which has been activated and so elements of both
countries are in operation in that area," Puno said.

NEW DELHI, April 24 (Xinhua) -- India's tiger population has
registered a double increase to 3,435 in 1997 from 1,578 in 1972,
Indian Minister of State for Environment and Forests Babulal
Marandi said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The statistics were based on the past six censuses of the wild
cats, which covered 14 states across the country, Marandi told
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to Project Tiger launched in the subcontinental nation
in April 1973, there are now 23 tiger reserves across India.
However, it still requires a lucky stroke for a tourist visiting
any of the reserves to catch sight of a tiger.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said that when U.S. President Bill Clinton
visited a natural reserve in Jaipur, Rajasthan during his South
Asian tour late last month, it took reserve rangers more than a
week to trace tigers so that their distinguished American guest
could be ensured a sight of the animals during his one-day stay.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid Monday asked two ministers to resign from their posts.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State for Investment and Promotion of State
Enterprises Laksamana Sukardi and Minister of Industry and Trade
Jusuf Kalla were both summoned to the presidential palace Monday
afternoon. Kalla told reporters later that the president asked
both of them to resign.
</P>
<P>
"The president explained to us that the economic team (in the
cabinet) was divided and therefore we should resign. The reason is
because the economic and industry cabinet is not solid," Kalla
said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he wanted to resign, Kalla said: "No, but we had
better resign rather than see the cabinet dissolved."
</P>
<P>
Laksamana made no comment after the meeting with Wahid.
</P>
<P>
According to cabinet secretary Marsilam Simanjuntak, Laksamana
would be replaced by his departmental secretary Rozy Munir and
that Indonesian ambassador to Singapore Lieutenant General Luhut
Pandjaitan would take over from Kalla.
</P>
<P>
The new ministers will be sworn in on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kalla came from the Golkar Party while Sukardi was treasurer of
the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle chaired by Vice
President Megawati Soekarnoputri.

ISLAMABAD, April 24 (Xinhua) -- At least five people were
injured in a series of bomb blasts in two government buildings in
Quetta, capital of Balochistan province in southwest of Pakistan
on Monday, according to a news dispatch reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Local officials and witnesses were quoted as saying that the
bomb blasts, which took place one after another at short intervals,
caused panic in the city and stirred the administrative machinery
of the provincial metropolis into action.
</P>
<P>
The first explosion took place at 14:35 (local time) in the
premises of the Quetta Commissioner's office. The main gate of the
building was broken in the blast and two people were injured.
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, another bomb exploded in Block-1 of the
Balochistan Secretariat, wounding three people. A third explosion
occurred at the Minister Block of the same building at 15:23.
</P>
<P>
The explosions stirred the local administration, which
evacuated and sealed off the buildings of the Balochistan High
Court, the provincial assembly, and district courts as a
precautionary measure. The injured were admitted to local
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
No individual or group has so far claimed responsibility for
the blasts. Last week, two bomb explosions took place in Quetta

<HEADLINE> Writethru: 20 people Taken Hostage by Armed men in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A total of 20 people were
taken hostage by six heavily armed men Sunday night from Sipadan
island off Sabah, East Malaysia, but their motives behind the
abduction are yet to be confirmed, Malaysian Police said Monday.
</P>
<P>
While police could not yet confirm the captors' motives,
politics, ransom and feelings of dissatisfaction were among the
possible reasons, Malaysian Police Inspector-General Norian Mai
told a news conference here at the federal police headquarters.
</P>
<P>
"We seriously feel that politics may be a reason," he said.
</P>
<P>
He did not rule out the possibility that the kidnapping was
connected to the Abu Sayyaf rebel group which was holding several
hostages in southern Philippines. "There is a possibility."
</P>
<P>
He said police had not made any contact with the kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
It was however confirmed that among the hostages, there are 11
foreigners -- three Germans, two South Africans, two French
nationals, two Finns, one Lebanese and one Filipino while the rest
nine are Malaysians comprising four workers of the Wildlife
Department, three workers of the Sipadan resort center, a
policeman and a staff of Syarikat Borneo Divers.
</P>
<P>
According to Norian, an American couple, both aged 51, who were
captured together with the 20 people, managed to escape before
they were forced into a boat.
</P>
<P>
They fled into the jungles and emerged Monday morning, and
their condition was good and they were not injured, he said.
</P>
<P>
Norian said the armed men raided the police base on the island
before capturing the hostages.
</P>
<P>
"They came in two 'jongkong' boats, and when fleeing with the
hostages they used only one jongkong boat and seized a boat
belonging to the resort center. Their other boat was left behind,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
A special team has been set up by the Malaysian police to
rescue the hostages and the Malaysian police are in contact with
their counterparts in Southern Philippines in efforts to track
down the kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi
said earlier Monday Malaysian security forces are in hot pursuit
of the kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
He said the authorities are determined to secure the release of
the foreign tourists and local residents held hostage. "Freeing
them is uppermost," he added.
</P>
<P>
Describing the incident as unexpected, Abdullah said it should
prompt the police to review the security of territorial waters off
Sabah.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar also
held a news conference earlier Monday on the incident, saying that
all the 20 people taken hostage by armed pirates were safe.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said the names of the hostages would be released by
the Malaysian police.
</P>
<P>
He said the incident was an "isolated" case and it was safe for
people to visit Sipadan island, a resort popular with scuba-divers.

<HEADLINE> Hotels in Zimbabwean Capital Fall Victim to Political Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Most hotels in Harare said Monday
that the unstable political situation had adverse impact on hotel
occupancy over the Easter holidays.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Harare Holiday Inn told the Zimbabwe News
Agency that hotel occupancy had been at an average of 40 percent
since last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Although I don't have last year's figures at hand, the rate
has gone down drastically compared with last year. For the past
two weeks we have been having a problem with dropping occupancy
levels attributed mainly to cancellations. The cancellations seem
to be linked to the political situation as most of them are from
international visitors who book in advance," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said many tour groups and those requiring conference
facilities had cancelled with the excuse that they had postponed
their conferences but had not given new dates.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Bronte Hotel said the hotel was experiencing a
lot of cancellations and hotel occupancy was at 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The reasons they give are that Zimbabwe at the moment is
politically unstable. It could be the issue of the two white
farmers who have been killed and the negative information about
Zimbabwe abroad," he said.
</P>
<P>
Political violence is getting a foothold in Zimbabwe and two
people from the opposition Movement for Democratic Change have
been killed in the run up to the parliamentary elections which are
scheduled for May.
</P>
<P>
Farm invasions by war veterans which have culminated in the
death of two white commercial farmers have also helped to tarnish
Zimbabwe's image as a safe tourist destination.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Blast in Zimbabwean Capital Condemned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Union of Journalists
(ZUJ) on Monday condemned the weekend bomb explosion next door to
the offices of the Daily News newspaper in downtown Harare.
</P>
<P>
ZUJ Secretary-General Basildon Peta said in a statement that it
seemed the "primitive and barbaric" act was primarily targeted at
the Daily News in view of the threatening letter sent to the
newspaper's editor-in-chief Geoff Nyarota prior to the incident.
</P>
<P>
"We urge the Zimbabwe Republic Police to seriously investigate
both the source of the threatening letter to Nyarota and the
arsonists... and bring the culprits to book," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The lack of seriousness on the part of the police in
investigating death threats made to journalists before is very
worrying and discouraging and police inaction is largely to blame
for the current state of affairs in which some sections of
Zimbabwean society now see themselves as being above the law," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the media had become a key target of the sections that
become virtually immune to the laws that governed over citizens.
</P>
<P>
The bombing of the Daily News was also a desperate attempt to
scare the independent press from fulfilling its vital mandate in
the run up to the parliamentary elections, he said.
</P>
<P>
Unless the police investigated this incident seriously and
arrested the culprits, intimidatory tactics against the media
would increase and at times with disastrous consequences, he said.
</P>
<P>
The bomb blast on Saturday night extensively damaged the art
gallery and the windows of the Daily News offices and those of the
nearby Standard Chartered Bank.

<HEADLINE> China's 1st Satellite Still Orbiting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Dongfanghong-I, China's first
satellite which was launched into the orbit 30 years ago,
continues to orbit the Earth, though its storage batteries have
run out of power, Beijing Youth Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
"The day, April 24, 1970, was the happiest day of my life,"
said Qi Faren, an expert who joined the Dongfanghong project at
the age of 37.
</P>
<P>
On this day 30 years ago, the rocket carrier, now known as "
Long-March I," stood on the launch-pad waiting for the order for
projection at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwestern
Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
The ignition took place at 21:35. "Upon seeing it ignite on
cable TV in an underground compound, I ran out and saw the
beautiful rocket dashing into the sky southeastward," recalled
Shen Jianan, a rocket expert.
</P>
<P>
The satellite, weighing 172 kg, had been broadcasting the
melody of Dongfanghong (The East is Red), a chant for late Chinese
leader Mao Zedong, until its storage cells stopped working.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three decades, China has launched 65 satellites
including 20 foreign ones. Last year, China sent its first
experimental spacecraft into orbit, opening a new era for the
country's ambitious space industry. Chinese astronauts are
expected to make a journey into space in domestically manufactured
space shuttles.

<HEADLINE> China to Develop Space Industry Properly: Vice Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have been
urged to work as hard as ever to ensure that the country's
fledgling space industry develops in a healthy, orderly, and rapid
manner.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo made the call in a letter to the
Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National
Defense, expressing congratulations on the 30th anniversary of the
launching of China's first satellite, Dongfanghong-I, on April 24,
1970.
</P>
<P>
Dongfanghong-I was developed and projected under the decision
made by the first-generation leadership of the Communist Party of
China with Mao Zedong at the core, and it was personally directed
by former Premier Zhou Enlai and Marshal Nie Rongzhen, according
to the vice premier.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists designed and manufactured the first
satellite, and its successful launching broke the superpowers'
monopoly in the field of sophisticated space technology, while
further consolidating China's status as a large country in the
international arena, the letter says.
</P>
<P>
Wu points out that China's space industry has made remarkable
achievements since that first satellite, and it is an important
symbol displaying China's economic, technological, scientific, and
defense strength.

<P>

official in charge of disciplinary work, has pledged to deepen the
current anti-corruption campaign by instituting structural reforms
meant to wipe out corruption at the source.
</P>
<P>
Wei, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau
of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, made the remark
during his inspection tour of Shenzhen and several other cities in
southern Guangdong Province from April 13-24.
</P>
<P>
To prevent abuse of power at the source has been the
fundamental measure to prevent and control corruption, Wei said.
Shenzhen has heralded a series of reforms including open-bidding
for land-use rights, setting-up of property markets, and
experimenting with government procurement in an effort to build a
clean government, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
He condemned some leading officials for misusing their
administrative powers and taking huge bribes, adding that some
loopholes in the system have been used by these corrupt officials
to make their own profits.
</P>
<P>
Wei proposed that supervision should be increased over projects
which have to be examined and approved by administrative
departments.

<HEADLINE> Universities in Gaza Resume Class </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Study was resumed at Azhar University
and the Islamic University in Gaza Strip on Monday, nearly a week
after they were closed following the bloody clashes between Hamas
supporters and the pro-Fatah students.
</P>
<P>
The situation seemed to be calm Monday with dozens of students
entering the campuses of the two universities located opposite to
each other, though Palestinian policemen were still patrolling the
streets outside.
</P>
<P>
Clashes erupted on April 18 between supporters of Fatah, the
main faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) led by
Yasser Arafat, and those of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas)
at the two universities.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 students from both sides, including six female
students, were injured in the clashes. Six policemen were also
wounded when they entered the two campuses to disperse the crowds.
</P>
<P>
The violent clashes broke out when the pro-Hamas students at the
Islamic University tried to prevent Fatah supporters from hanging
posters carrying Arafat's photos, and due to a statement issued by
the Fatah supporters defending their victory in the student
election held last month. 
</P>
<P>
The pro-Hamas faction accused the pro-Fatah group of winning the
recent election in the college of education of the university by
foul play. 
</P>
<P>
During the election at the Islamic University, dominated by
Islamites, the pro-Hamas students got 71 percent of votes, against
22 percent for the pro-Fatah supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Clashes flared up after students from the neighboring Azhar
University flooded into the campus to support their colleagues
</P>
<P>
The board of trustees at both universities ordered the closure
of the two campuses and the suspension of study for three days
starting from April 18, but they decided on April 22 to extend this
period till Monday.

<HEADLINE> Peace Serves Interest of Middle East Peoples: Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
stressed on Monday that "peace is in the interest of all peoples in
the Middle East."
</P>
<P>
In a televised speech to mark the 11th anniversary of the total
recovery of Sinai, Mubarak said the peoples in the region are "
looking forward to a historic overall reconciliation that will put
a just end to an era of pains and sufferings."
</P>
<P>
The peace process between Arab countries and Israel has made
long strides and "should not be obstructed by petty ambitions," the
Egyptian leader said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak underlined that the Sinai liberation anniversary "gives
us an incentive to be more keen on rendering the peace efforts a
success."
</P>
<P>
The Sinai Liberation Day, which falls on April 25, "makes us
more persistent on overcoming impediments facing settlement efforts
in order to bring about peace and security in the Middle East," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt was the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
Israel in 1979. Israel withdrew from Taba, a resort in eastern
Sinai, in 1989, enabling Egypt to recover the last part of its
territories occupied by the Jewish state in Mideast wars.

<HEADLINE> Chinese to Be Used in Housing Contracts in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Residents in the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) of China can, beginning from May,
choose either Chinese or Portuguese as the language used in
housing and mortgage contracts, the Macao Daily News reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The leading Chinese newspaper quoted government sources as
saying that the Notarization Authority is able to complete
contracts in the language requested by clients. Housing and
mortgage contracts have been made only in Portuguese as a result
of Portuguese rule in Macao, which was put to an end in last
December. In fact, more than 95 percent of local residents are
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law of the Macao SAR stipulates that both Chinese and
Portuguese are official languages in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Government officials said that clients only have to provide
basic data and the Notarization Authority will work out the text
of contracts, in either Chinese or Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
The Notarization Authority has also reached agreements with
local banks with regard to the use of Chinese in mortgage-related
formalities.

<HEADLINE> All Books Published in Macao to Be Seen on Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, April 24 (Xinhua) -- An Internet-based virtual library
is being constructed and in five years it will contain all books
published in Macao.
</P>
<P>
The library will become a comprehensive data bank which is
accessible to world-wide researchers and common readers interested
in Macao, said Wu Zhiliang, director of the UNESCO Center of Macao.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the full text of Encyclopedia of Macao, a
comprehensive reference book published last year, has been made
available at the website of www.unesco.org.mo.
</P>
<P>
Beginning from May, about three or four books published by the
government-subsidized Macao Foundation will be placed into the
virtual library each week. It is estimated that some 350 books
will be put onto the Internet in two years.
</P>
<P>
In the second phase of the program, about 500 books of other
publishing organs in Macao are expected to be seen on the Internet,
Wu said.
</P>
<P>
The library will also include the introductions and major works
of Macao's artists. In addition, a forum will be set up to collect
valuable articles on the studies concerning Macao.

<HEADLINE> China Regulates Lottery Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- China is computerizing its
lottery system and handing out cash awards to stamp out fraud in
the fast-growing lottery industry, according to the Ministry of
Finance.
</P>
<P>
China has issued a total of 50.277 billion yuan worth of
lottery tickets since 1987. The Chinese spent 14.302 billion yuan
on lottery games in 1999, nearly double the amount in the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
This year, the government is planning to issue 13 billion yuan
worth of lottery tickets, 44 percent more than the scheduled
figure of 9 billion yuan in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The central government, which controls China's lottery
business, has so far allowed only two kinds of lotteries to be
held around the country, namely the sports and social welfare
lotteries.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance said in a news release today that the
management of the government-run lottery industry has loopholes
and is handicapped by many problems.
</P>
<P>
For example, some institutions and individuals have held
unauthorized lotteries or sold government lottery tickets without
approval. Poor management of the lottery has led to mass looting
and destruction of property in some places.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance decided recently that lottery prize
money will be distributed in the form of cash instead of goods. It
is also holding computerized lotteries in about half of the areas
in China. It has also urged sports and social welfare authorities
to develop nation-wide computer networks for lottery ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
The news release said that these methods will sidestep such
circumstances as inferior quality of prize goods. They will also
make the process of issuing lottery tickets more manageable and
transparent.
</P>
<P>
One of the advantages of these methods is preventing large
crowds of people from congregating at ticket sales sites, which is
liable to cause losses of property and even casualties.
</P>
<P>
The computerized lottery networks enable people to buy tickets
at lottery stations around the country. Prize money can be
transmitted directly to a winner's bank account.

increase over March 1999 while the cumulative total for the first
quarter of 2000 reached 2,966,116, up 13 percent from the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
This growth is reflected in the hotel occupancy rates which
were 86 percent this March compared to 81 percent last year, while
the first quarter rate was 81 percent against the 78 percent
recorded in the same period in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Some of the strongest growth in March came from the short-haul
regional markets. Arrivals from the Republic of Korea were up 33.9
percent compared to March 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese mainland continues to be the biggest source market,
contributing 288,798 visitors, many of whom were attracted by
travel promotions and major trade fairs in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Turkey's Presidential Hopefuls Face Contest by Xing Guoxin and Huai Chengbo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of Turkey's ruling
tripartite coalition held a meeting on Monday in a last-ditch
attempt to reach a consensus on a presidential candidate who may
garner support from the opposition parties as well.
</P>
<P>
According to the election procedure, the deadline for
presidential nominations expires at midnight Tuesday and the
presidential elections should be completed by May 15.
</P>
<P>
As the three leaders entered their fourth meeting in three weeks
on the presidency, it is believed that they have a dim chance of
reaching an agreement on a joint candidate and it is much more
probable that each party will nominate its own candidate.
</P>
<P>
In this case, Speaker of the Grand National Assembly
(parliament) Yildirim Akbulut, who is expected to announce his
candidacy on Tuesday, will have an increased chance of becoming the
next president.
</P>
<P>
Four names have been mentioned for presidential candidates so
far. In their last tripartite meeting, Democratic Left Party (DSP)
leader and Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit proposed DSP deputy and
Foreign Minister Ismail Cem or Professor Mehmet Haberal, dean of
Baskent University, for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
The Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) leader and Deputy Prime
Minister Develet Bahceli proposed MHP deputy and Defense Minister
Sabahattin Cakmakoglu or Professor Kamil Turan, dean of the Law
School in Gazi University.
</P>
<P>
Mesut Yilmaz, leader of the Motherland Party (ANAP), however,
refrained from naming candidates during the meeting and reserved
the right of making an assessment of the issue with the ANAP
executives.
</P>
<P>
It was expected that other names may appear on the agenda of
Monday's meeting. After talking with his coalition partners, Ecevit
will consult the main opposition Virtue Party (FP) leader Recai
Kutan and True Path Party (DYP) leader Tansu Ciller.
</P>
<P>
During the past meetings, Ecevit asserted that none of the
ruling partners' leaders should be nominated as presidential
candidates to avoid potentially adverse impact on the stability of
the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Neither Bahceli nor Yilmaz reacted to the statement, which was a
clear indication that Ecevit was not in favor of presidency for
Yilmaz, who has been eyeing for the position since the very
beginning of his joining in the coalition government as the junior
partner.
</P>
<P>
The ANAP is still determined to nominate its leader as
presidential candidate. One ANAP executive member said that "if no
agreement is reached in the summit, we will nominate Yilmaz as our
candidate."
</P>
<P>
He predicted that Yilmaz would be the most likely candidate to
assume office, adding that those candidates suggested by Ecevit and
Bahceli will not even be able to garner votes from their own
parties.
</P>
<P>
He said that Akbulut, also from ANAP, is the only candidate
capable of challenging Yilmaz for presidency. The speaker has
reportedly affirmed to Yilmaz that he will run for presidency.
</P>
<P>
Due to the souring relations between Yilmaz and Akbulut, it is
believed that Akbulut will not hesitate to challenge Yilmaz for
office, even if Yilmaz is nominated as a presidential candidate by
ANAP.
</P>
<P>
The majority of deputies, regardless of their party background,
are strongly against the nomination of a candidate from outside the
parliament, therefore they give practically no chance to either
Professor Haberal or Professor Turan.
</P>
<P>
Although numerous public polls showed that Cem is the favorite,
he lacks support in parliament. Following a briefing on foreign
relations last week in parliament, Cem received staunch criticism
from FP and DYP deputies as well as from ANAP deputy Kamran Inan,
chairman of the Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Commission.
</P>
<P>
Cem's biggest handicap is his being a member of a left-wing
political party in a parliament dominated by right-wing ideals. The
coalition partner MHP simply would not give the green light to Cem
because he is a leftist from ANAP.
</P>
<P>
For the same reason, it is believed that the opposition parties,
the FP and DYP, will also refrain from providing him any support.
Under such circumstances, it is expected that Cem will not receive
support from his own ANAP either.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic circles here said that the MHP Defense Minister
Cakmakoglu might get some support from all the political parties
other than the DYP, though far from being adequate to carry him to
the Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
Other candidates, who officially nominated themselves for the
presidency, are DSP deputy Mail Buyukerman, ANAP deputy Agah Oktay
Guner and DSP deputy Oguz Aygun.
</P>
<P>
These candidates, who are devoid of any support and only came
forward to protest the attitude adopted by their leaders, have no
chance of winning the presidency at all, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Reformists Call for Calm Following Paper Closure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Iranian reformists on Monday called
on the people to maintain calm and to take legal actions against
the closure of 12 reformist papers by the conservative judiciary.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the reformist "May 23 Front" Behzad Nabavi said in
an interview printed in the Moshakerat (Participation) daily that
the front has started talks to find legal means to remove
restrictions on the press and freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
Voicing the front's protest to the closure of reformist papers,
Nabavi said that the front will follow up the case carefully with
consideration of the sensitive situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, dailies of the front, formed by 18 pro-reformist
parties and groups in support of President Mohammad Khatami, also
urged the people to keep calm and avoid any actions which may
damage tranquility of the country in order "not to give any
pretexts to violence-seekers."
</P>
<P>
Issuing a statement published in Moshakerat, the dailies
condemned the closure of reformist papers and underlined the need
to respect laws. Any actions out of the limits of laws would not be
accepted by the dailies of the front, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance in Charge of
Press Affairs Shaban Shahidi Moaddab told the daily "Iran" that his
ministry is making efforts to remove the closure imposed on the
reformist papers through legal channels.
</P>
<P>
He said that the ministry, which is responsible for screening
and safeguarding the press, has entered talks with the judiciary
and no result has been reached so far.
</P>
<P>
Iran's conservative judiciary on Sunday night ordered the
closure of eight dailies, three weeklies and one monthly in Tehran,
dealing a serious blow to the freedom-seeking Iranian press which
supports the reformist President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Justice Department issued a statement at midnight that
those publications were closed down for printing materials that
disparaged Islam and the religious principles of the Islamic
revolution.
</P>
<P>
The statement, quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency on
Monday, accused the publications of persistently printing "abusive
materials whose scheme was part of the cultural assault of the
foreign enemies of Iran with the aid of their agents who had
infiltrated into the ranks of Iranian journalists."
</P>
<P>
The closed dailies include Gozaresh-e Rouz (Today's Report),
Bamdad-No (the New Morning), Aftab-e Emrouz (Today's Sun), Payam-e
Azadi (the Message of Freedom), Fath (Conquer), Arya, Assr-e
Azadegan (Times of the Freed), Azad (Free).
</P>
<P>
The weeklies of Payam-e Hajar (the Message of Hajar), Aban, and
Arzesh (Value) as well as the monthly Iran Farda (Iran Tomorrow)
were also ordered to stop their publications.
</P>
<P>
The papers were also charged of violating the country's
constitution, the press law and other relevant laws and printing
materials against the good of the Iranian society and national
unity and security.
</P>
<P>
The tone of materials in those papers had brought smiles on the
faces of the enemies of the Islamic republic and hurt the feelings
of devout Muslims at home and even the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The closure of 12 reformist publications, unprecedented in the
history of the Islamic regime, came amid a mounting political
crackdown on the mouthpieces of the reformists, who won an
overwhelming victory in the February parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei, who was seen as the backbone of the conservatives, on
Thursday gave a serious warning to the reformist press and accused
a number of papers of "having turned into bases of the enemies and
doing the same thing as the British, the U.S. and the Israeli
broadcasting agencies are trying to do."
</P>
<P>
The conservatives, who dominate most of state organs but
suffered a series of setbacks in elections in the past two years,
launched desperate attacks on the reformists since the February
parliamentary polling.
</P>
<P>
A dozen of reformist journalists and publishers have been
summoned to courts in the past month and at least three journalists
and publishers have been sent to prison mainly on charge of
defaming or propagating against Islamic values.
</P>
<P>
The outgoing conservative parliament last week also passed an
amendment to the press law imposing more restrictions on the press
and allowing various judicial bodies to close down papers.
</P>
<P>
Observers noted that the harsh move by the conservatives
indicated the seriousness of power struggles in the country
following their humiliating defeat in February polls.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Defense Minister Off for Saudi Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Defense Minister Ali
Shamkhani left here Monday morning for a ground-breaking visit to
Saudi Arabia to discuss security cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Shamkhani is the first Iranian defense minister to visit Saudi
Arabia since Iran's Islamic Revolution in 1979 which toppled the
pro-U.S. shah's regime.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, Shamkhani said that following a long
period of tension-reduction, Iran has entered an era of building
confidence with other countries, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Appreciating the expansion of Tehran-Riyadh relations, he said
Iran and Saudi Arabia share common points in religious, political,
economic and security fields and the two countries have taken a
positive step in forging security cooperation by exchanging
military attaches.
</P>
<P>
He termed Tehran-Riyadh ties as a good example for the Gulf
states to expand relations and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Shamkhani's visit is in response to the visit of his Saudi
counterpart Prince Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz to Tehran in April last
year, during which the two countries agreed to exchange military
attaches. Relations between the two countries have steadily
improved since reformist Iranian President Mohammad Khatami came to
power in 1997. They went through years of mutual suspicion after
Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution.

WELLINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Six people died in a plane
crash in central Otago on New Zealand's South Island Monday,
according to TV New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The 6-seater Cessna 206 hit a hill in the Lindis Pass and
crashed.
</P>
<P>
The crash happened near state highway eight about 30 kilometers
south of Omarama.
</P>
<P>
Local police have not been able to confirm the plane's flight
plan.
</P>
<P>
A helicopter pilot, Simon Spencer-Bower, who has been to the
crash site, believes the plane may have been trying to turn around
at the time of the crash.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted as saying the plane would have been flying in low
cloud and it appears the pilot tried to turn around before
realizing the plane was too low.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Try East Timor Human Rights Abusers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Attorney General
Marzuki Darusman said Monday that his side would submit to the
court dossiers of those were allegedly involved in atrocities in
East Timor at the end of May.
</P>
<P>
"Issues of human rights abuse in East Timor is one of our main
agenda that have to be solved soon. Next week, we will start
summoning those (who) were recommended by the National Commission
on Human Rights(Komnas HAM) to have been involved in human rights
abuse in East Timor. We will launch further investigation against
them," Marzuki told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said investigators would question several generals,
including former chief of the Indonesian Military Gen. (retired)
Wiranto, next week before submitting papers to the court.
</P>
<P>
Trials usually begin about a week after the papers are
presented.
</P>
<P>
In January, the Komnas HAM recommended to the Attorney General'
s Office a total of 33 people who were suggested to have been
responsible for atrocities in the breakaway province of East Timor.
Wiranto was on the list.
</P>
<P>
After East Timor voted in favor of independence in a U.N.-
sponsored direct ballot in August last year, the territory plunged
into a bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of East Timorese then were forced to
leave the territory and took shelter at the neighboring province
of East Nusa Tenggara.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Allows Free Corporate Bonds Issuance by  Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has granted general
permission of the Controller of Foreign Exchange to resident and
non-resident controlled companies to issue corporate bonds without
seeking Bank Negara (State Bank)'s approval, according to the Bank
Negara governor Monday.
</P>
<P>
This is however subjected to the conditions that the proceeds
of the bond issues are not used to finance investments abroad or
refinance offshore borrowings, and meeting other normal conditions
on the issuance of private debts securities, central bank governor
Ali Abul Hassan Sulaiman said at Malaysia's 2nd national banking
summit here.
</P>
<P>
This is part of the measures to accelerate the development of
the capital market with the authorities well aware of the need for
expedient approval to issue corporate bonds being essential to
corporate issuers, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Bank Negara thus was committed to make the
necessary changes to allow such a process to be shortened.
</P>
<P>
On the outlook of domestic banking in the 21st Century, the
governor said one thing that would dominate the banking scenario
then was the need for financial institutions to be competitive and
innovative.
</P>
<P>
He said the banking scenario of the time would be shaped by key
factors such as greater reliance on market forces to determine
business outcome and less protection by government for individual
institutions.
</P>
<P>
The banks would also see more demanding customers for new
products and quality service, greater competition from within and
outside the country and greater disintermediation process away
from banking, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the increasing role of technology and specialized
skills and good human resource development would also determine
the winners in the financial industry.
</P>
<P>
To drive financial innovation and support economic growth, he
said the intellectual assets of the banking sector are as vital in
the virtual world as the equipment and technology.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian banking system in the 21st century would have to
be supported by a wide pool of skilled, dynamic and experienced
local talent that would be resilient under any scenario, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that to compete effectively, banks would need to
explore ways to expand their capacity and capabilities to better
serve the demands of customers.

<HEADLINE> Australia Applauds Indonesia's Move Against Illegal Immigration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government's
attempts to stop people smuggling into Australia is welcome but
would not put an end to the problem, the Australia government said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock has applauded Indonesia's
attempts to stop people fleeing to Australia after Sunday's
detention of 157 boat-bound Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian authorities detained the Iraqis, including seven
children, as they were about to board a fishing boat in West Java.
</P>
<P>
Police said they were interrogating two Indonesians believed to
be behind the operation, after a tip-off from local villagers.
</P>
<P>
"It's been evident for some time that Indonesia has been active
and this is evidence of the ongoing cooperation between Australia
and Indonesia," Ruddock told the Ten TV network.
</P>
<P>
"I don't expect that the smuggling is going to come to an end
but obviously we welcome any steps that Indonesia is able to take,
" Ruddock said.
</P>
<P>
"And we will work with them in cooperating to get people back
home," he added.
</P>
<P>
Numbers of illegal boat immigrants has declined, with problem
weather and tougher legal measures hindering their arrivals, but
it is clear that people are still planning the risky journey,
Ruddock said.

<HEADLINE> Single National Health Database Not Desirable: AMA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A single national health
database would present unacceptable risks to patient privacy and
should be avoided, the Australian Medical Association (AMA) warned
Monday.
</P>
<P>
AMA federal Vice-President Sandra Hacker said there is a
growing political momentum for a national integrated health data
bank and federal and state health ministers are expected to
consider such a proposal as early as July.
</P>
<P>
But such a proposal would be too risky, Hacker said.
</P>
<P>
"The significant issue for us is that health databases are
potentially extremely dangerous. And while the AMA is very much in
support of electronic health, it is in support of linkages rather
than an immense," she said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Single health database would be just too risky," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
Hacker said better information links between doctors,
hospitals and medical services could be provided on electronic
cards carried by the patients.
</P>
<P>
She said everyone wanted to see better use of technology to
improve patient care but there were some real dangers in the
headlong rush now being pursued by politicians.
</P>
<P>
"The world is on the brink of a major technology revolution in
health care but not all players have the best interests of the
patients at heart," she said.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Qantas Rejects Pilot Error in Rome Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Australia's Qantas airline
Monday rejected pilot error as a cause of last Saturday's runway
aircraft accident at the Rome Airport.
</P>
<P>
The jet's undercarriage collapsed as the airline's Boeing 747-
300 was performing a U-turn to line up for takeoff.
</P>
<P>
Qantas Executive General Manager of aircraft operations David
Forsyth said the accident appeared to be caused by stress on
landing gear as the fully laden plane made the turn.
</P>
<P>
"At this stage pilot error hasn't been suggested as a possible
cause," he told the ABC Television.
</P>
<P>
"It looks very much like it's a torsional failure of the upper
end of one of the landing gear cylinders," he said. "We never
rule anything out but at this stage it looks extremely unlikely
that it would be anything to do with pilot error."
</P>
<P>
"It looks very much like it's a straight mechanical-structural
failure of a landing gear component," he added.

<HEADLINE> Iran-Egypt Ties Significantly Improved: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Hamid Reza Asefi said here Monday that relations between Iran and
Egypt, particularly in the areas of economy and culture, have
improved significantly.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on recent remarks made by Egyptian Foreign Minister
Amr Moussa, Asefi said "the grounds for mutual cooperation are
different from the past," the official Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian foreign minister stated recently that a new chapter
has been opened in relations between the Iranian and Egyptian
governments and that contacts had been made with his Iranian
counterpart Kamal Kharrazi on political developments in Islamic
countries.
</P>
<P>
Asefi told reporters that both countries are pursuing bilateral
cooperation at the regional and international levels.
</P>
<P>
Continuous consultations are being held between Iranian and
Egyptian officials, he said, adding that both countries share
common views on many issues.
</P>
<P>
He expressed satisfaction with the level of Tehran-Cairo
cooperation, stressing that the two countries are determined to
make use of their potentials in order to further promote bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Egypt severed diplomatic relations after the 1979
Islamic revolution, as Tehran accused Cairo of signing the Camp
David peace accord with Israel, the first such accord signed by an
Arab country.
</P>
<P>
However, since the election of Iran's moderate President
Mohammad Khatami, Tehran and Cairo have improved bilateral
relations and cooperation, even though they have not resumed
diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian officials called on Iran to remove the hurdle to a
resumption of ties by changing the name of a main street in Tehran.
The street was named after Khaled Islamboli, the assassin of former
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981.
</P>
<P>
On its part, Iran urged the Egyptian side to demolish the tomb
of late Iranian shah in Cairo, making it a condition for Iran to
change the street name.
</P>
<P>
In January, the non-governmental Iran-Egypt Friendship
Association was formed in Tehran, regarded as a step toward
expanding bilateral contacts and ties between the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the association Sabah Zanganeh has said that his
association would lobby for the resumption of bilateral ties,
though it would not press Iranian government over the issue.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Involvement in Peace Talks Important: Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leadership stressed
Sunday night on the importance of U.S. participation in the third
round of Palestinian-Israeli negotiations which will start on April
30 in Eilat, a Red Sea resort in southern Israel.
</P>
<P>
This came after a weekly meeting of members of the executive
committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and
ministers of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), presided
over by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, in the West Bank city of
Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
According to the Palestinian News Agency, the Palestinian
leadership regards the U.S. participation in the negotiations as "
reflecting the belief of the U.S. president and administration in
the need to push these negotiations ahead and achieve a tangible
progress."
</P>
<P>
During his recent meeting with Arafat in Washington, President
Bill Clinton said the U.S. is ready to play a bigger role to help
push forward the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, which failed to
make any substantial progress during the past six months.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Clinton decided to send U.S. Mideast peace envoy
Denis Ross to the Eilat talks, which will focus on the last phase
of Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and the final-status
issues to pave the way for concluding a lasting peace treaty by
September.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leadership said it has briefed the Israeli side
on its position on the final-status issues, including Jerusalem,
borders, water, Palestinian refugees and Jewish settlements, in
accordance with the relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
It also repeated its rejection to all attempts to divide or
delay the final-status issues, noting that a final accord leading
to a comprehensive peace in the region cannot be reached without
the application of the international resolutions on the
Palestinian, Syrian and Lebanese tracks of negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Raids Hit Mosque in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli bombardment hit a mosque in
south Lebanon Monday morning, Oriental Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli attacks aimed at the village of Hadatha facing the
occupied zone in south Lebanon. A civilian house was also damaged
in the raids, but there has been no report of casualties.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said the Israeli shells nearly hit the Ireland
military camp of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon
(UNIFIL).
</P>
<P>
Retaliation attacks between the Israeli troops and Lebanese
resistance guerrillas intensified after Israel formally notified
the United Nations that it would pull out its troops from south
Lebanon by July after a 22-year occupation.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak stressed Israel will harshly retaliate
if the resistance continues firing Katyushas to northern Israel or
causes any casualties after its withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel has occupied parts of south Lebanon since 1978. It set up
the present "security zone" in 1985 with the excuse of protecting
its northern settlements from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Hezbollah, or Party of God, backed by Iran and Syria,
has since been leading a war of attrition aimed to oust the Israeli
forces and its proxy South Lebanon Army.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid said that Indonesia now needs a national reconciliation and
dialogue to revive spirit of nation unity and bridge differences
of various cultures among people in a bid to boost the on-going
reforms process and build a new Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar with the theme "Toward a New Indonesia
Through National Reconciliation" here Monday, the president said:
"What the nation needs is another reconciliation and dialogue on
how to unite the country's various cultures into one."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Tyasno Sudarto said that
the Indonesian Army will back the idea of national reconciliation
to accelerate the national reform process.
</P>
<P>
"The Indonesian Army will back national reconciliation. The
Army is a part of the nation. We back and urge all components of
the nation to materialize a national reconciliation. With the
reconciliation we hope (we will) accelerate reforms process,"
Sudarto said at the seminar.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Attorney General Marzuki Darusman said
that the most important thing for this nation is how to make a
deal to fasten the process of resolving cases now confronting the
country such as the case of former president Soeharto, the Bank
Bali scandal and human right abuse.

process. We also can learn from South Africa which has been
successful in making national reconciliation," Tandjung said.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Juwono Sudarsono shared Tandjung's point of
view. "Before 2004, all of the cases which are now still
challenging the country, such as human right abuse cases and
communal conflict issues, could be resolved, " Sudarsono said.

He urged the government to speed up the establishment of the

<HEADLINE> 1.7 Million Tourists Visit Guilin in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Some 1.7 million domestic and
overseas tourists visited Guilin, one of China's most famous
scenic cities, in the first three months of the year.
</P>
<P>
Of them, 149,000 were from other countries, up 66.6 percent in
a year-on-year comparison. Most of the foreign tourists were from
the Republic of Korea (ROK), Japan, the United States, Southeast
Asian countries, as well as Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao regions,
said local sources.
</P>
<P>
The city is best known for its natural scenery, clear water
and strange-shaped stone formations.
</P>
<P>
Industry experts said the upturn in Guilin's overseas tourism
industry reflects the end of the financial crisis that has
beleaguered most of the Asian countries since the later half of
1997.
</P>
<P>
They believe that the city has been successful in its efforts
to improve the environment for tourism. It has spent huge amounts
on rebuilding old city areas and renovating existing scenic sites,
adopted various measures to rectify the order in tourism industry,
and stepped up tourism promotion.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, they said, the business opportunities that
have emerged in the run-up to China's anticipated accession into
the World Trade Organization (WTO) have prompted a number of
businessmen from Europe and the United States to visit China, and
they often took the opportunity to sightsee in popular places like
Guilin.

<HEADLINE> Suspension Corridor Helps Tourists View Rain Forest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Visitors now can have a bird's
eye view of a dense tropical rain forest at Xishuangbanna, a
tourist attraction in southwest China's Yunnan Province, from a
suspension corridor between trees.
</P>
<P>
The 700-meter-long, wood-plank corridor on steel cables is
built between Wantian trees, the tallest arbor in the forest.
</P>
<P>
The suspension corridor, 50 meters above the ground, is said to
be the highest of its kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
Wangtian trees in Xishuangbanna's tropical rain forest can grow
to 80 meters. They are some 20 meters taller than other trees in
the forest.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Mengla Nature Reserve said that a one-
kilometer-long route has also been opened in the rain forest under
the suspension corridor, which enables visitors to see the forest
on the ground.
</P>
<P>
The Dai Nationality Autonomous Prefecture of Xishuangbanna in
Yunnan Province boasts 70,000 hectares of primitive forests, more
than 5,000 species of plants and various kinds of fruits, rare
animals like peacock, tiger, leopard, elephant and wild ox.
</P>
<P>
It also has attractive folk arts, customs, buildings and
paintings of the Dai nationality.
</P>
<P>
It was made a state-level scenic spot in 1982.

<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Municipal authorities of Beijing,
China's capital, have paid great attention to economic development
and social progress in areas inhabited by ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
There are some 480,000 people of minority ethnic groups in
Beijing, and a large number of them live in 5 townships and 109
villages in the suburbs. To help people there develop the economy,

With rapid economic growth, the per capita income reached 3,845
yuan in the townships and villages in 1999, far above the national
average.

<P>
Beijing has now 34,980 ethnic-minority government functionaries,
accounting for 4.14 percent of the city's total.
</P>

KUWAIT CITY, April 24 (Xinhua) -- One Saudi security officer was
killed and three others wounded in clashes in the southwestern
Saudi city of Najran, the official Saudi Press Agency (SPA)
monitored here reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
SPA quoted an official in the Saudi Interior Ministry as saying
the clashes broke out when security officers were searching the
house of a resident engaged in witchcraft in the city. It did not
mention the date of the search.

During the operation, an armed man opened fire at the security
force and seriously wounded one of them. The gunman was arrested.
</P>
<P>
But a group of people gathered around the residence of the emir
of the region later, calling for release of the attacker.
</P>
<P>
Some of the protesters opened fire at the residence and set cars
afire, killing one security officer and wounding three others.

<HEADLINE> Israeli PM Orders Emergency Medical Aid to Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak has issued orders to send emergency humanitarian aid and
medical supplies to famine-struck Ethiopia, Israel Radio reported
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Two Israeli Hercules cargo planes carrying medicine, baby food,
blankets and other emergency items will leave for Addis Ababa in
the coming days, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
In addition, an Israeli medical team is also expected to
accompany the shipment to treat the Ethiopian victims of the
famine.
</P>
<P>
Yossi Kucik, director-general of the Prime Minister's Office,
has been authorized to coordinate the humanitarian operation with
his counterparts in the Defense, Health and Foreign ministries.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by his office, Barak said that Israel can
not be indifferent to the terrible suffering and the human tragedy
taking place in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Millions of Ethiopians are currently fighting for survival in
the famine due to drought in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
According to the United Nation's Food Program, some eight
million Ethiopians are desperately in need for emergency food and
medical aid.
</P>
<P>
"It is incumbent upon us - as a part of the family of nations,
as the state of the Jewish people, and as a society that has
absorbed many Ethiopian immigrants - to do all we can to aid the
citizens of Ethiopia," Barak said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 26,000 Ethiopian Jews, or Falash Mura, are
reportedly waiting in compounds in two Ethiopian cities for
immigration to Israel. They are descendants of Jews who converted
to Christianity some 100 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Israel carried out Operation Moses in 1984 to bring 8,000
Ethiopians to Israel and Operation Solomon in 1991 to airlift
another 14,000 Falash Mura.
</P>
<P>
There are many debates within Israel's Jewish community over how
many of the remaining Falash Mura are eligible to immigrate under
the Law of Return.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Interior Minister Natan Sharansky flied to Addis Ababa
earlier this month to evaluate how to best handle the problem.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Hold Parliamentary Runoff in May: Daily Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran may hold the second round of
parliamentary election in early May to decide the winners of some
65 seats, the conservative daily Tehran Times reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Guardians Council (GC) is trying to set the stage for
holding the runoff on May 5, and it is believed that the council
will manage to do so, an informed source told the paper.
</P>
<P>
About 225 seats were decided in the first round of the sixth
parliamentary election on February 18, with reformers allied to
President Mohammed Khatami bagging more than 75 percent of the
total.
</P>
<P>
The results have caused political tension in the country, as the
conservatives, still controlling most of the powerful state organs,
are unwilling to accept their defeat in the competition.
</P>
<P>
The new Majlis (parliament) has a total of 290 seats. As
stipulated by the election law, those candidates who did not get
the minimum 25 percent of votes went to the second round.
</P>
<P>
The runoff was scheduled to be held later this month, but it has
to be put off because the conservative-dominated GC, watchdog of
the elections, has yet to fully approve the results in the first-
round election.
</P>
<P>
Unsatisfied with the initial polling results, the GC has
canceled the qualifications of first-round winners in a number of
constituencies around the country, stirring up a series of protests
and consequential arrests.
</P>
<P>
According to the Tehran Times report, former president Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani, currently heading the advisory and arbitrary
State Expediency Council, is still insisting that the GC should
remove all the ambiguities surrounding the outcome of the first
round of election in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, close to the conservatives, ranked the 30th in the
Tehran constituency, the last one in the winners list which is
almost totally occupied by reformers.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the same source, who asked not to be named, the paper
said that Rafsanjani will not take his seat in the parliament if
ambiguities are not removed.
</P>
<P>
In the past few weeks, the GC ordered several times to recount
votes in Tehran, including recounting votes of Rafsanjani and those
candidates that ranked near him to remove the so-called
ambiguities.
</P>
<P>
However, reformers and the Interior Ministry, organizer of the
election, have expressed their objection to the GC's measures,
insisting that the election was held fairly.
</P>
<P>
If everything goes smoothly, the new parliament should take
office at the end of May.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Reformists Call for Calm Following Paper Closure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Iranian reformists on Monday called
on the people to maintain calm and to take legal actions against
the closure of 12 reformist papers by the conservative judiciary.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the reformist "May 23 Front" Behzad Nabavi said in
an interview printed in the Moshakerat (Participation) daily that
the front has started talks to find legal means to remove
restrictions on the press and freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
Voicing the front's protest to the closure of reformist papers,
Nabavi said that the front will follow up the case carefully with
consideration of the sensitive situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, dailies of the front, formed by 18 pro-reformist
parties and groups in support of President Mohammad Khatami, also
urged the people to keep calm and avoid any actions which may
damage tranquility of the country in order "not to give any
pretexts to violence-seekers."
</P>
<P>
Issuing a statement published in Moshakerat, the dailies
condemned the closure of reformist papers and underlined the need
to respect laws. Any actions out of the limits of laws would not be
accepted by the dailies of the front, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance in Charge of
Press Affairs Shaban Shahidi Moaddab told the daily "Iran" that his
ministry is making efforts to remove the closure imposed on the
reformist papers through legal channels.
</P>
<P>
He said that the ministry, which is responsible for screening
and safeguarding the press, has entered talks with the judiciary
and no result has been reached so far.
</P>
<P>
Iran's conservative judiciary on Sunday night ordered the
closure of eight dailies, three weeklies and one monthly in Tehran,
dealing a serious blow to the freedom-seeking Iranian press which
supports the reformist President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Justice Department issued a statement at midnight that
those publications were closed down for printing materials that
disparaged Islam and the religious principles of the Islamic
revolution.
</P>
<P>
The statement, quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency on
Monday, accused the publications of persistently printing "abusive
materials whose scheme was part of the cultural assault of the
foreign enemies of Iran with the aid of their agents who had
infiltrated into the ranks of Iranian journalists."
</P>
<P>
The closed dailies include Gozaresh-e Rouz (Today's Report),
Bamdad-No (the New Morning), Aftab-e Emrouz (Today's Sun), Payam-e
Azadi (the Message of Freedom), Fath (Conquer), Arya, Assr-e
Azadegan (the Time of the Freed), Azad (Free).
</P>
<P>
The weeklies of Payam-e Hajar (the Message of Hajar), Aban, and
Arzesh (Value) as well as the monthly Iran Farda (Iran Tomorrow)
were also ordered to stop their publications.
</P>
<P>
The papers were also charged of violating the country's
constitution, the press law and other relevant laws and printing
materials against the good of the Iranian society and national
unity and security.
</P>
<P>
The tone of materials in those papers had brought smiles on the
faces of the enemies of the Islamic republic and hurt the feelings
of devout Muslims at home and even the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance, which is
responsible for screening and safeguarding the press, has not yet
shown any reaction to the closure.
</P>
<P>
The closure of 12 reformist publications, unprecedented in the
history of the Islamic regime, came amid a mounting political
crackdown on the mouthpieces of the reformists, who won an
overwhelming victory in the February parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei, who was seen as the backbone of the conservatives, on
Thursday gave a serious warning to the reformist press and accused
a number of papers of "having turned into bases of the enemies and
doing the same thing as the British, the U.S. and the Israeli
broadcasting agencies are trying to do."
</P>
<P>
The conservatives, who dominate most of state organs but
suffered a series of setbacks in elections in the past two years,
launched desperate attacks on the reformists since the February
parliamentary polling.
</P>
<P>
A dozen of reformist journalists and publishers have been
summoned to courts in the past month and at least three journalists
and publishers have been sent to prison mainly on charge of
defaming or propagating against Islamic values.
</P>
<P>
The outgoing conservative parliament last week also passed an
amendment to the press law imposing more restrictions on the press
and allowing various judicial bodies to close down papers.
</P>
<P>
Observers noted that the harsh move by the conservatives
indicated the seriousness of power struggles in the country
following their humiliating defeat in February polls.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Slams U.S., Britain for Blocking Communications Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Transport and
Communications Minister Ahmad Murtadha Ahmad Monday held the United
States and Britain responsible for blocking its contracts under the
United Nations oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the official Iraqi News Agency (INA),
the minister said that the U.S. and British delegates at the U.N.
Sanctions Committee have suspended 25 contracts valued at 154
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The contracts were signed with foreign countries under the
fourth, fifth and sixth phase of the U.N. oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
He said those blocked contracts were for the purchase of spare
parts, cables and technical instruments for repairing and
modernizing Iraq's communications system.
</P>
<P>
The minister accused the U.S. and British delegates of
deliberately putting on hold these contracts, with the aim to cause
more harm to the Iraqi people and prolong the decade-long
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under stringent U.N. sanctions ever since its 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
In an exemption to the embargo, the U.N. oil-for-food deal
launched in 1996 allows Iraq to import food, medicine and other
essential goods for its people, who have been hardest hit by the
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Sanctions Committee vets contracts Iraq signed with
foreign countries under the U.N. humanitarian program, and the U.S.
and British envoys at the committee have often delayed approval of
contracts on grounds that certain purchases could have a military
use.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Army to Observe Turkish-Jordanian Military Exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Defense Force (IDF)
is to send officers to Jordan to observe the upcoming joint
maneuvers of Jordanian and Turkish land forces, a local daily
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The exercise is to take place in mid-May and Turkey will send
120 land forces to undergo combat training with Jordanian soldiers
and the IDf has been allowed to send observers to the exercise, the
Jerusalem Post quoted IDF sources as reporting.
</P>
<P>
The move comes as Israel is quietly pushing to upgrade defense
ties with Jordan. While many senior officers from the Jordanian
armed forces have been hosted by the IDF, the number of reciprocal
visits is much lower in comparison.
</P>
<P>
"The Jordanians visit here more than we there," said a senior
IDF officer. "But we are pushing them on this," he added.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Jordan signed a peace treaty in 1994, but Israel does
not have a military attache in Amman.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Israel have twice held joint search-and-rescue naval
maneuvers in the Gulf of Eilat and Jordanian medical officers have
observed hospital training in Israel. There is also strong
coordination and communication between the IDF and Jordanian
commanders along the border.
</P>
<P>
But joint military maneuvers have yet to be held between Israeli
and Jordanian soldiers, which would mark a new era in their
military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Jordan first held a 20-day company-level army
exercise two years ago at a military base near Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Turkish defense ties are also strengthening. Turkish
Chief of Staff Gen. Huseyin Kivrikoglu and other senior Turkish
officers are expected to visit Israel in mid-May.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Drought-Hit India Crying Out For Water, Food (Part One)  By Zhou Xiaozheng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From Gujarat and Rajasthan in the west to Orissa and Andhra
Pradesh in the east, more than 50 million thirsty and starved
people are crying out for water and food, and, if possible, a
little fodder for their poor dying cattle.
</P>
<P>
The western part of the country was hit most severely by the
calamity: 26 of the total 32 districts of Rajasthan state, where
some 23,400 villages were located, were haunted by famine
resulting from the summer drought, while in the neighboring
coastal state of Gujarat, the drought situation was described as
the worst in the past century.
</P>
<P>
Reports sent back to the capital by officials and media people
flocking to the two western states in the past week depicted a
miserable and somewhat horrible picture about life of the drought-
afflicted people: fields were parched and crops wilted; wells
dried up and people caught diseases or even died from drinking
contaminated water; men were leaving home to find a living in
neighboring states like Punjab, while women, children and the
elderly were left behind waiting for government relief.
</P>
<P>
Stories with pathetic titles like "No Food, No Water" and "Not
A Drop to Drink", along with pictures of people in desperate
search of remote water sources and bodies and skeletons of dead
cattle, occupied headlines and frontpages of all major newspapers
in Delhi.

especially among scuba-divers.
</P>
<P>

</P>

<HEADLINE> Philippine Extremist Group Urged to Free Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine military appealed
Monday to the Abu Sayyaf to free all the 27 hostages to avoid
bloodshed as the military offensive continues in the southern
province of Basilan, Philippine News agency (PNA) said.
</P>
<P>
Major General Diomedio Villanueva issued the appeal while he
confirmed that the ongoing operations will continue in an effort
to safely recover the hostages from the hands of the extremists
group,the PNA said.
</P>
<P>
"I appeal to the Abu Sayyaf to give up the hostages majority
of whom are women and children," he was quoted as saying in a
press conference in Isabela town, Basilan.
</P>
<P>
According to Villanueva, the ongoing operation is not aimed to
capture terrain objectives, not to kill the Abu Sayyaf but the
primordial concern is to give the hostages maximum chance to
survive the assault.
</P>
<P>
"This is a hostage situation, not a tactical movement wherein
the primordial reason is to safely rescue hostages. we will see to
it that hostages will be given maximum chance to survive," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, operation casualties registered 15 Abu Sayyaf
members dead while three government troopers were killed and three
wounded in the government side.
</P>
<P>
Villanueva said the assault has not yet reached Camp Abdurazzak,
where the main Sayyaf lair lies and where the hostages are being
kept.
</P>
<P>
The targets are the three satellite camps, several meters away
from their main lair where no hostages stay.
</P>
<P>
Glicerio Sua, 103rd Brigade Commander based in this province,
also was quoted as saying that so far his troops have not
encountered any problem since the operation started midnight of
Holy Friday toward early dawn Black Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"So far, we have not encountered major problems in the field
except when sometimes the weather is unfavorable which somehow
interferes with the conduct of the operation but of minimal
adverse effect," the commander said.

<HEADLINE> Efficiency Improved in Kenya's Indian Ocean Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Indian Ocean port of
Mombasa has improved its efficiency as the delivery of goods from
the port to Uganda can be finished in four days instead of 28 days
a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
The improvement has been attributed to an express train service
between Mombasa and Uganda's capital Kampala that runs twice a
week starting early this month, the latest issue of the East
African weekly newspaper reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The port authority has sent a team to Uganda and Rwanda
publicizing the message of improved railway transport service.
</P>
<P>
Early this year the Kenya Ports Authority sacked corrupt port
officials at Mombasa in order to change the poor performance,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The newly-appointed team has made strategic plans like
rehabilitating and upgrading the equipment and boosting the morale
of the staff.
</P>
<P>
They also emphasized the cooperation with other stakeholders,
like Kenya Railways Corporation, Uganda Railways Corporation and
Kenya Revenue Authority.

<P>
TOKYO, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices rebounded in Tokyo
Monday on bargain-hunting following their recent sharp falls due
to selling related to the replacement of 30 of the benchmark
Nikkei's components.
</P>
<P>
The newly reshuffled Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose 227.
47 points, or 1.25 percent, from last Friday's close to end at 18,

<HEADLINE> SW China Province to Build More Affordable Housing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan Province
plans to build more affordable housing this year to provide more
apartments for medium and low-income families.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan built nearly seven million square meters of economy
housing last year with a total investment of 4.4 billion yuan (530
million US dollars), said Cheng Zhengning, director of the
provincial construction department.
</P>
<P>
"This year, the construction scale of such houses will be
larger than that of last year," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Cheng, the price per square meter for economy
housing is 100 yuan (about 12 dollars) lower than that of
commercial houses.
</P>
<P>
This has enabled more individuals to buy houses, bringing about
a 60 percent increase in sales of the province's real estate last
year, he added.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the province's per capita living space
was 11.3 square meters, three times more than 20 years ago, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
China has abolished its decades-old welfare housing
distribution system and has encouraged people to buy their own
houses.
</P>
<P>
Mindful of the modest income of most Chinese citizens, the
government worked out a series of preferential policies toward
building affordable housing, including lower land prices and a 50
percent cut in building tax.
</P>
<P>
As a result, low-priced housing has become a mainstay of China's
real estate market, local observers noted.

<HEADLINE> Yunnan Turns More Farmland into Woodland and Grassland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan
Province will spend 117 million yuan (14 million U.S. dollars) on
a State project to turn more farmland into woodland and grassland
this year, according to the provincial forestry department.
</P>
<P>
The project will be carried out in Zhongdian, Heqing, Huize,
Lijiang, Yuanmou, Xundian, Yiliang and Lanping counties as well as
in the Dongchuan District of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan.
</P>
<P>
The eight counties and Dongchuan District will plant over 53,
300 hectares of trees and grass this year.
</P>
<P>
The province will give a total 30 million kilograms of grain to
farmers who have donated their farmland.
</P>
<P>
The project was part of the program launched by the Chinese
government to curb serious soil erosion in its western region -- a
result of excessive felling of trees and farming. The program
requires all provinces and autonomous regions in western China,
including Yunnan, to turn all the fields at hillsides with a grade
of 25 degrees into woodland or grassland.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Yunnan has 800,000 hectares of sloping
fields, or 12.5 percent of the province's total arable land.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan turned 50,000 hectares of farmland to forest and
grassland in 1999. The province plans to turn 600,000 hectares of
sloping farmland into forest and grassland between 2000 and 2010.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan, one of China's biggest forest areas, is located in the
upper reaches of the Yangtze, Zhujiang and Lancang rivers.

<HEADLINE> Archeological Finding Reveals Ancient Yellow River Courses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists have
uncovered a section of earth that helps to show changing courses
of the Yellow River, the second longest in China, in the past 1,
000 years.
</P>
<P>
The finding was made in Yongji City, Shanxi Province in north
China, near the site of an ancient Yellow River crossing. The
archeologists dug deep into the ground, and found alternate layers
of sand and hard soil. They unearthed porcelain pieces and ancient
utensils in the layers of hard soil, and identified that the
layers of sand were formed by silting.
</P>
<P>
They determined that the layers were formed in six dynasties of
Chinese history, from the Tang dynasty (618-907) to the period of
the Republic of China (1912-1949), when the river changed its
course time and again.
</P>
<P>
Four huge iron oxen along with iron human figures were found
earlier at the Pujindu Ferry, an ancient river harbor in the city.
Built in the middle Tang Dynasty, they were used to fasten anchors
and people wished the lumbersome objects each weighing 146 tons
could harness the wanton river.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe the archeological finds can help the study of
the process of soil erosion in the upstream of the river.
Historical records show that the river changed its course 26 times
over the past 2,000 years. Each time, the change caused huge
economic losses and hundreds and thousands of people were forced
to abandon their homes.

and the work is urgent.
</P>
<P>
He said the country's grain production areas should tap the
most of their advantages in this regard, and turn out more and
still better agricultural produce.
</P>
<P>
While the ecologically-weak areas, especially those in the
country's dry west, local governments and farmers should place
more emphasis on reconverting farmland into forest and grassland,
and develop agriculture suitable to the distinct characteristics
of each region, Wen said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier also stressed that while efforts are made to
increase the local farmers' income, concrete measures have to be
adopted to relieve their burdens.
</P>
<P>
All localities should strictly carry out the rules and
regulations governing farmers' rights and interests, and
agricultural fees and taxes should never exceed the levels in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In his conversations with local grassroots-level officials, the

<HEADLINE> Satellite Remote Sensing Used to Monitor Red Tides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- China will use satellite remote
sensing technology to monitor red tides in its coastal areas,
according to the State Oceanic Administration.
</P>
<P>
The system is the same as meteorological satellite monitoring
used for typhoons, and it guarantees that no red tide will be
overlooked within China's seas, Qu Tanzhou, director of the State
Marine Environmental Monitoring Center, said today.
</P>
<P>
When a red tide is detected by satellite, low-flying airplanes
and ships will be sent to the area to confirm it, Qu said.
</P>
<P>
The satellite remote sensing technology was used successfully
last year to monitor red tides at three key areas including Bohai,
estuaries of Yangtze River, and Pearl River.
</P>
<P>
A red tide is a dense population of aquatic microscopic
organisms that breed in the abundance of salt in surface water.
The micro-organisms appear in most of the world's waters and most
are harmless. However, some single-cell organisms produce a poison
that paralyzes and kills fish. These organisms may also suffocate
the fish by consuming nearly all the oxygen in the water.
</P>
<P>
Specialists say that the red tide is mainly caused by pollution
from land and the large-scale farming in coastal waters, which
produce too much nitrogen and phosphorus.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the frequency of red tides along China's
coastal areas is climbing. From 1993 to 1997, a total of 265 red
tides were reported in Chinese waters.
</P>
<P>
More than eight billion tons of pollutants are released into
China's coastal areas every year. In addition, geologists note
that excessive reclamation of land from marshes has also damaged
the ocean ecology and is yet another factor leading to the
increasing occurrence of red tides.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Beef Up Coastal Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has decided to establish a
helicopter fleet to help maintain order in the country's coastal
waters, reported the Anatolia News Agency on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The fleet will be responsible primarily for preventing weapons
smuggling, drug trafficking and illegal immigration, according to a
project within the framework of the Defense Industry
Undersecretariat (SSM) program.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's coastline exceeds 8,300 kilometers. It is surrounded by
the sea on three sides: the Mediterranean in the south, the Aegean
in the west and the Black Sea in the north. The two continents,
Europe and Asia, are separated by the Straits of Bosphorus and
Dardanelles and the Sea of Marmara.
</P>
<P>
The fleet will also be used to monitor pollution, illegal
fishing, destruction of habitats and the salvaging of sunken
treasures.
</P>
<P>
Based on an agreement signed between the SSM and an Italian
company, delivery of the first nine AB-412EP helicopters, four of
which belonging to the coast guard, will begin in January, 2001 and
electronic equipment, including radio, operation monitors and video
recorders, will be installed in the copters.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The deadlines for the framework agreement and the final peace
deal for Palestinian-Israeli final-status issues will be met,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"There is absolutely no delay to the deadlines. There is going
to be a continuation of the negotiations on April 30 in Eilat and
in Taba," Arafat told reporters in Ramallah upon his arrival from
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
It was his first public statement since his Thursday meeting
with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington, at which Arafat had
briefed Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Senior Israeli and Palestinian negotiators said Sunday that
they expect to miss the May target date for the framework agreement
for a final peace between them in September.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Chief negotiator Oded Eran said dates were in any event
unimportant - and the planned May accord could be signed by June.
</P>
<P>
Senior Palestinian negotiator Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu
Mazen, blamed Israel for the delays. He said the sides would most
likely miss the September deadline for forging a treaty as well.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Arab newspapers on Sunday were predicting that Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak will host Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
for a meeting in Egypt sometime in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
One report said the summit would take place in Alexandria,
Egypt, while the international Arabic daily Al Hayat quoted
Egyptian sources as saying the meeting would take place in the
coming days.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders, who have not met for the last 18 months, are
expected to discuss the state of the peace process, with particular
attention to the still-frozen Israeli-Syrian track.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Jordan's King Abdullah, accompanied by his wife Rania and a
host of ministers, took a brief sail across the Gulf of Aqaba
Sunday to make his first visit to Israel since ascending to the
throne.
</P>
<P>
His visit to Eilat lasted only hours, but included a private
meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, a brief tour of the
southern resort town of Eilat and a visit to a fish-breeding plant
in the sea.
</P>
<P>
Although no joint press conference took place - despite advance
scheduling for such an event - the king conducted taped interviews
with Israel television stations, in which he called his
relationship with Barak "terrific," expressing "admiration" for
Barak's "courage and great responsibility."
</P>
<P>
He said that he envisions a political solution for Jerusalem
that has "two levels." One is a division of the city into two
political domains, and the other a declaration of Jerusalem as an
open city to all three religions - Judaism, Christianity and Islam.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Conservatives Close Seminaries Against Reformists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran's religious seminaries
dominated by the powerful conservatives closed on Monday in a
protest to the newly-grown reformists for attending a controversial
conference in Berlin, the state-run television reported.
</P>
<P>
The news channel of the pro-conservative television said that
seminaries throughout the country stopped regular classes to
condemn the Berlin conference and support the recent remarks of the
supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
The religious seminaries took the action amid spiraling
struggles between the two rival camps over the Berlin conference
held by the Heinrich Boell Foundation on Iran after the February
parliamentary elections, in which reformists won an overwhelming
victory over the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
The conference organizer had invited some close allies and
supporters of President Mohammad Khatami, including the
investigative journalist Akbar Ganji who was jailed on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The hard-liners, who control most of the country's sensitive
organs, condemned the conference as "religiously prohibited," after
the state-television screened parts of the conference scenes
including an oversea Iranian woman dancing without Islamic
dressing.
</P>
<P>
In the recent weeks, conservatives organized rallies and
demonstrations throughout the country and accused the reformists of
advocating the United States-style reforms in Iran, which was
strongly rejected by the supreme leader.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei has warned that Iran would never accept the U.S.-style
reforms and warned the freedom-seeking press that a number of
papers had "turned into bases of the enemies."
</P>
<P>
The conservative judiciary on Sunday night announced to close
down 12 publications for printing materials accused of having
disparaged Islam and the religious principles of the Islamic
revolution.
</P>
<P>
The reformists hit back the conservatives by accusing the state
television of trying to stop the new reformist-dominated parliament
from meeting and undermining Khatami's reform programs by screening
selective parts of the Berlin conference.
</P>
<P>
President Khatami, who opened an era of reforms in the country
after coming to power in 1997, on Saturday also blamed the
television for screening parts of the Berlin conference.

<HEADLINE> IMF Optimistic Indonesian Currency to Regain  Strength </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After having breakfast with President Abdurrahman Wahid at the
presidential palace Monday, Fischer said it is however difficult
to expect what would happen to the rupiah on a day-to-day basis.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah dropped to a six-month low against the U.S. dollar
on Thursday, hitting 8,005 to the greenback. Dealers attributed
the falling of rupiah to the slow progress of the government's
program for economic restructuring within the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said he and Wahid had discussed the delayed 400 million
U.S dollars loan from the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the IMF delayed to disburse its loan package due to
failure of the Indonesian government in implementing reforms
programs as scheduled by both sides, the IMF and the government,
in April. It was reported that Indonesia had met almost all the
conditions to win a 400-million-dollar installment and the
Indonesian government expects the IMF's board to meet on May 15 to
release the cash.
</P>
<P>
Fischer told reporters that many things should be taken into
consideration, making it too early to say when the loan could be
released.
</P>
<P>
But it could be disbursed early in June, he said, adding that
there will be more discussions on this.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the (Indonesian) government will implement all the
program," he added.
</P>
<P>
Fischer arrived here Sunday with his team to review the
progress made by the Indonesian government in implementing its
economic reform program.
</P>
<P>
After arriving here, Fischer held a session with several
economic advisors to Wahid and met with Attorney General Marzuki
Darusman to discuss the latest developments in judicial reform,
one of the most important elements of the country's reform
programs.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Police Boss Vows to Curb Road Carnage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan police have moved to
enforce public transport rules in the wake of two bus accidents
which had killed 148 people in one month, the Daily Nation
newspaper said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Police Commissioner Philemon Abong'o announced Sunday

<HEADLINE> KFOR Troops Detain Serb Leader, Release Him After Clash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 23 (Xinhua) -- A Serb leader of Yugoslavia's
Kosovo province was temporarily detained by the NATO-led
peacekeeping forces (KFOR) Sunday, leading to a clash between
local Serbs and the peacekeepers which injured several people.
</P>
<P>
According to a Tanjug report, the KFOR troops stopped and
searched the car carrying Oliver Ivanovich, a Serb leader of
Kosovska Mitrovica, on his way to Leposavich. They checked his ID
documents and demanded to take pictures of him. Ivanovich rejected
the demand, the report said.
</P>
<P>
A clash broke out soon after over 200 local Serb residents
rushed to the scene and the KFOR troops opened fire into the air.
Ivanovich later told reporters that he saw some Serbs and "one or
two Belgians" were injured.
</P>
<P>
The tension eased after a KFOR officer arrived and "recognized
Ivanovich and ordered to release him," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Ivanovich told the press that the KFOR was overtly imposing
pressure on Serb leaders, who are "unwilling" to join an interim
administration commission established last December by Bernard
Kouchner, chief of the U.N. special mission in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of such a commission was opposed by most of
the Serb leaders in Kosovo.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Japan's merchandise trade surplus
in fiscal 1999 fell 13.9 percent from the previous year to 12,102.
3 billion yen (about 108.1 billion U.S. dollars), down for the

while imports increased 3.0 percent to 36,442.9 billion yen (about
325.5 billion dollars), the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Exports fell due to a stronger yen, while imports grew on the
back of rising crude oil prices and an improving Japanese economy,
a ministry official said.

<P>
Japan's politically sensitive surplus with the United States
rose 10.6 percent to 7,371.8 billion yen (about 65.9 billion
dollars), up for the third consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
With its trading partners in Asia, Japan registered a trade
surplus of 3,887.8 billion yen (about 34.7 billion dollars), up 2.
3 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
With the 15-member European Union (EU), Japan's trade surplus
posted the first drop in three years, slumping 16.0 percent to 3,
579.3 billion yen (about 31.9 billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> Troussier Has More Chances, Says JFA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Football Association of Japan (
JFA) said Monday that Wednesday's international friendly against
South Korea in Seoul will not be viewed as the "last chance" for
Japan coach Philippe Troussier, whose contract runs out in June.
</P>
<P>
JFA Vice President Kunishige Kamamoto was quoted by Kyodo as
saying that he has already prepared a dossier on the Frenchman
which he intends to present to JFA chief Shunichiro Okano early
next month.
</P>
<P>
"We will not make a final decision on the basis of the match in
Seoul. The contents of my report are finalized and I'll be handing
it in after the holiday period," said Kamamoto.
</P>
<P>
A string of mediocre performances by Japan's senior national
side, including seven matches without a win in 1999, has led to
speculation that the JFA might not extend Troussier's contract
beyond June.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Customs Seizes Sportswear with Fake Trademarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Customs officers in Shanghai
have just uncovered a trademark infringement case involving
illegal use of world-famous sporting goods brand names Nike and
Adidas.
</P>
<P>
They seized 246,000 individual phony-label Nike and Adidas
sportswear items worth a total of 5.67 million yuan (about 683,000
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Customs sources cited this as the largest intellectual property
rights infringement case ever handled by the local customhouse.
</P>
<P>
The sportswear, made by a garment factory in Shishi, a booming
city in east China's Fujian Province, was scheduled to be exported

<HEADLINE> News Feature: A Day in Pudong (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a gateway both to the entire Chinese market and to the
broader global market, Pudong district in Shanghai daily brings in
an average eight million US dollars in foreign investment and is
the showcase of China's reform and opening up.
</P>
<P>
Attitudes of Shanghai citizens toward Pudong have made a U-turn.
In the past, they looked down on Pudong as a second-class district
-- a centuries-old shanty town.
</P>
<P>
But the face of Pudong changes with each passing day: Gray
houses and dirty streets are vanishing while some 200 high-rises
have sprung up.
</P>
<P>
Daniel S. Lam, Manager of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation Limited (HSBC) Shanghai branch, remembers that when he
first came to Pudong in 1991, he had trouble finding a restaurant
acceptable for entertaining clients, and had to take a taxi to go
to the other side of the river.
</P>
<P>
"But now, you can easily find luxury restaurants in Shangri-La
or Jinmao Tower," he said, referring to the sort of four-star
eateries common in the city.
</P>
<P>
Every day, construction workers build floor space of 5,203
square meters -- equivalent to five stories of New York's Empire
State Building.
</P>
<P>
More and more renowned multinationals consider Pudong their
primary investment destination because of its favorable policies,
superior location, sound laws and regulations as well as abundant
skilled personnel and speedy communication services.
</P>
<P>
On average, 430,000 Intel chips are manufactured in Pudong,
tens of thousands of Omron sensors roll off production lines, and
nearly 500 Sharp air conditioners are sold from the area to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
China began developing Pudong on April 18, 1990, in a drive to
reinvigorate Shanghai as an international trade and financial
center and to promote economic development of the Yangtze River
reaches.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, around 6,000 foreign companies have
established subsidiaries, nearly two a day.

<HEADLINE> Ericsson Tapping China's Mobile Internet Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Swedish telecommunications giant
Ericsson plans to launch its newly-developed Wireless Application
Protocol (WAP) phones in China in the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
An Ericsson source said that his company has listed China as a
target market for its mobile Internet technology products.
</P>
<P>
Ericsson (China) Co., Ltd has already signed an agreement with
China Motion Network Co., Ltd to jointly develop the mobile
Internet market in China this year, the source said.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, Ericsson will provide advisory
services and mobile application platforms, such as WAP, and a
mobile e-mail box platform.
</P>
<P>
Following an exhibition in Shanghai last week, Ericsson will
display its WAP phones in Beijing and Guangzhou, capital of south
China's Guangdong Province, at the end of April and in May,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
WAP technology was developed by leading mobile phone
manufacturers including Ericsson, Nokia and Motorola for the
connection of handsets with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures show that China now has 40 million mobile
phone users and ten million Internet users.

<P>
With a gleaming collection of office buildings, Lujiazui
Financial and Trade Zone is referred to as China's Wall Street,
home to nearly 100 financial institutions from both China and
abroad, including Citibank and Standard Chartered.
</P>
<P>
"Pudong is sure to become as active as London, New York, and
Singapore in economic development so long as it keeps on moving
forward," said Toru Mitarai, president of Japan's Sanwa Bank
Shanghai Branch.
</P>
<P>
Not all who pour money into Lujiazui are bankers: Tourists and
Shanghai brides and bridegrooms are plopping down big bucks in the
zone.
</P>
<P>
Every day, more than 10,000 tourists visit, and an expanse of
lawn amid skyscrapers in Lujiazui has attracted dozens of new-weds
who pose for wedding pictures there.
</P>
<P>
During the past decade, Pudong's urban space expanded from 17
to 100 square kilometers. By 2010, it is expected to further rise
to 200 square kilometers, similar to that of Osaka, Japan.
</P>
<P>
The 522-square-kilometer Pudong still reserves land for crops,
but most of the farm fields will be developed with high technology.
The Sunqiao Modern Agriculture Development Zone, with fresh
vegetables and fruits in greenhouses, is drawing more than 1,300
visitors every day.
</P>
<P>
To become an international shipping center, Shanghai is working
around the clock to build deep berths in Pudong. Construction of
the third phase of the Waigaoqiao project has started, while
preliminary preparations for the fourth stage are underway.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, Pudong's gross domestic product was six billion yuan (
about 720 million U.S. dollars), accounting for only one-
fourteenth of Shanghai's total.
</P>
<P>
But at the end of last year, Pudong's GDP soared to 80 billion
yuan, or one-fifth of Shanghai's total. The proportion may climb
to one-third by the end of 2010, said Huang Qifan, deputy
secretary general of the Shanghai Municipal Government, and
director of Shanghai Economic Commission.
</P>
<P>
"Pudong has become a hallmark of China's success in opening up
to the world," Huang said. "Many places in China are looking at
and learning from Pudong."
</P>
<P>
"Every day, every hour in Pudong is busy and efficient," said
Gu Gang, deputy director of the International Shipping Center
Construction Administration.

<P>
XI'AN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao has
called for all localities to do the spring planting carefully and
well in their respective areas.
</P>
<P>
Wen, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, made the call during a
recent inspection tour of China's northwest province of Shaanxi.
</P>
<P>
During the tour from April 19-23, Wen visited the province's
old revolutionaries bases, regions frequented by dry spells, and
some counties where he conferred with officials and farmers about
rural economy, agricultural restructuring as well as alleviation
of farmers' burdens.
</P>
<P>
China is entering into the spring planting season. Leading
officials at all government levels should go out to the
countryside and got acquainted with the problems faced by local
farmers and resolve their difficulties, the vice-premier said.
</P>
<P>
More meticulous efforts should be made to guarantee the steady
supply of crop strains and other means of agricultural production.
And agricultural science promotion departments should give more
and timely guidance to local farmers in the spring planting, Wen
said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he added, efforts should also be made to fight
against sales of substandard seeds, chemical fertilizer and
pesticides.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran's security forces have seized
some 1,882 kilograms of opium in recent anti-drug operations in the
southeastern Sistan-Baluchestan province, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the operations launched on Sunday, four smugglers have been
arrested and two others shot dead, according to Brigadier Nasser
Shabani, commander of law and order authority of the province.
</P>
<P>
He said some 32,200 kilograms of various kinds of drugs were
seized from traffickers in the province in the last Iranian year
which ended on March 19, a 310 percent increase compared with the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
In the same year, some 367 drug-traffickers were killed by the
anti-drug forces in the province, he added.
</P>
<P>
Iran is a main transit route for drugs smuggled from
Afghanistan, the world's largest opium producer, and neighboring
Pakistan to Europe and oil-rich Gulf Arab states.
</P>
<P>
It started strict anti-drug campaigns in 1989 after the Majlis

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Feels Unease over Delhi's Claims on Sheltering Indian Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi Foreign Ministry
has been placed in a delicate situation over the claim of the
Indian government that it has "shared information" that Bangladesh
harbors Indian insurgents, The New Nation newspaper reported here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government made this disclosure of "shared
information" about sheltering the rebels for the first time during
the recent-held Indo-Bangladesh border security forces meeting in
New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
"We don't know who in the Bangladesh government shared such
information which is unknown to usual official channel," said a
Foreign Office source requesting anonymity.
</P>
<P>
According to reliable sources, the Bangladesh side at BDR (
Bangladesh Rifles)-BSF (Indian Border Security Forces) chiefs
meeting was put in discomfiture when Indian media reported that
Bangladesh had been training Indian insurgents, quoting Bangladesh
Home Minister Mohammad Nasim, even though Bangladesh had always
refuted such claims in the past.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh side totally rejected the claims as cooked, mala
fide and without substance.
</P>
<P>
Indian claim of their insurgents receiving training in
Bangladesh was repeated by Indian State Minister for Foreign
Affairs Ajit Panja in the parliament three days after Bangladesh
Home Minister Nasim admitted that Dhaka used to train these rebels
during Bangladesh Nationalist Party and Jatiya Party period.
</P>
<P>
The only difference in the statements of the two ministers is
that India asserts their rebels are continuing to get support from
Bangladesh even now.
</P>
<P>
According to Bangladesh Foreign Office sources, it has been
difficult at the official level to reconcile the two opposing
stands: Home Minister saying Bangladesh used to shelter Indian
insurgents, while the government official stand being there is no
such rebel on the soil of Bangladesh ever.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that such statement by various ministries of the
government could provide alibi to term Bangladesh as a terrorist
state.

EPZ would also be in agro processing industries which were the
key sector for sustainable development, he added.

<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- China has made a major
breakthrough in atomic laser technology and acquired the core
technology for developing an atomic clock.
</P>
<P>
Researchers with the Electronics Department of Beijing
University used lasers to "capture" cesium atoms and cooled them
to nearly absolute zero (-273.16 centigrade).
</P>
<P>
At that low temperature, the moving speed of the cesium atoms
dropped from 300-400 meters per second to 3 centimeters per second.
</P>
<P>
Then scientists managed to make a ray of atom spring, in which
about 80 million cesium atoms sprayed one to two centimeters high
under the stimulation of laser.
</P>
<P>
That means China has acquired the core technology to develop
an atomic clock that is off one second every 30 million years,
said scientists.

the external economic sector and the composition of the nation's
export-import basket.
</P>
<P>
The review of the trade policy will remain focus on how far the
country's trade policies, including Customs rules as well as
tariff rates and regulations, have been adjusted to the business
rules of the newly-founded WTO multilateral trading system.
</P>
<P>
Such policy reviews take place every six years for Bangladesh,
and the last one was held in 1994.
</P>
<P>
A seven-member Bangladesh delegation, including the secretaries
of the Ministries of Finance and Commerce and Chairman of the
Board of Revenue, will attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Reports prepared in this connection separately by the
government and the WTO said that steps were gradually being taken
to bring Bangladesh's laws in line with the WTO agreements.
</P>
<P>
Expert groups have meanwhile prepared comprehensive review
reports of the country's trade policies. They have identified
progress so far achieved in trade liberalization and the area
where difficulties still remained to be sorted out.
</P>
<P>
WTO experts sent about 200 questions earlier to the Bangladesh
government and later a team visited Dhaka early this year before
compiling the report.

<HEADLINE> Water Shortage Affects Hospital Operation in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Water shortage in Pokhara, a
famous city for tourism in Nepal, is so severe that surgical
operations on patients can not go on smoothly in the Regional
Hospital in the city, according to a report reaching here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Medical Superintendent of the hospital Dr. Somat Singh Tulachan
said that as the Drinking Water Corporation in the city was not
able to supply water regularly, the operations on patients often
had to be postponed when water was not available in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes operations were performed by fetching water in
buckets," he added.
</P>
<P>
Singh admitted that lack of water had caused inconvenience to
the patients and the hospital was getting dirty.
</P>
<P>
Some patients complained that they had to bring water from home
for drinking and daily use.
</P>
<P>
And there is no regular supply of water even in the city,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The Regional Hospital in Pokhara is the biggest hospital of the
western region in Nepal, with 200 beds and about 500 out-patients
daily.
</P>
<P>
Although Nepal is rich in water resources, water shortage is
pervasive in the country because of its inability to tap the
resources and the lack of well-managed supply system. Even in
Kathmandu, the capital of the country, regular water supply can
not be guaranteed.

<HEADLINE> Iran Closes Down 12 Reformist Publications </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran's conservative judiciary on
Sunday night ordered the closure of eight dailies, three weeklies
and one monthly in Tehran, dealing a serious blow at the freedom-
seeking Iranian press which supports the reformist President
Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Justice Department issued a statement at midnight that
those publications were closed down for printing materials that
disparaged Islam and the religious principles of the Islamic
revolution.
</P>
<P>
The statement, quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency on
Monday, accused the publications of persistently printing "abusive
materials whose scheme was part of the cultural assault of the
foreign enemies of Iran with the aid of their agents who had
infiltrated into the ranks of Iranian journalists."
</P>
<P>
The closed dailies include Gozaresh-e Rouz (Today's Report),
Bamdad-No (the New Morning), Aftab-e Emrouz (Today's Sun), Payam-e
Azadi (the Message of Freedom), Fath (Conquer), Arya, Assr-e
Azadegan (the Time of the Freed), Azad (Free).
</P>
<P>
The weeklies of Payam-e Hajar (the Message of Hajar), Aban, and
Arzesh (Value) as well as the monthly Iran Farda (Iran Tomorrow)
were also ordered to stop their publications.
</P>
<P>
The papers were also charged of violating the country's
constitution, the press law and other relevant laws and printing
materials against the good of the Iranian society and national
unity and security.
</P>
<P>
The tone of materials in those papers had brought smiles on the
faces of the enemies of the Islamic republic and hurt the feelings
of devout Muslims at home and even the supreme leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance, which is
responsible for screening and safeguarding the press, has not yet
shown any reaction to the closure.
</P>
<P>
The closure of 12 reformist publications, unprecedented in the
history of the Islamic regime, came amid a mounting political
crackdown on the mouthpieces of the reformists, who won an
overwhelming victory in the February parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei, who was seen as the backbone of the conservatives, on
Thursday gave a serious warning to the reformist press and accused
a number of papers of "having turned into bases of the enemies and
doing the same thing as the British, the U.S. and the Israeli
broadcasting agencies are trying to do."
</P>
<P>
The conservatives, who dominate most of state organs but
suffered a series of setbacks in elections in the past two years,
launched desperate attacks on the reformists since the February
parliamentary polling.
</P>
<P>
A dozen of reformist journalists and publishers have been
summoned to courts in the past month and at least three
journalists and publishers have been sent to prison mainly on
charge of defaming or propagating against Islamic values.
</P>
<P>
The outgoing conservative parliament last week also passed an
amendment to the press law imposing more restrictions on the press
and allowing various judicial bodies to close down papers.

<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The Commission of Science,

this morning to celebrate the 30th anniversary of China's
successful maiden satellite launch.
</P>
<P>
Wu Bangguo, member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee, sent a congratulatory message
to the rally, calling for further growth of the country's space

</P>
<P>
Wu, also vice-premier of the State Council, said that the

<P>
The success made China the fifth country in the world, after
the former Soviet Union, the United States, France and Japan, to
launch its own satellite into the space.

"The successful launch had greatly uplifted the country's
status among its peers and boosted the morale of the whole nation,
" said Liu Jibin, minister in charge of the commission.
</P>
<P>

total of 61 satellites into the space.

JAKARTA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- At least four people were killed
in renewed communal clashes in Maluku province, Indonesia, on
Sunday, just two days before the arrival of Vice President
Megawati Soekarnoputri
</P>
<P>
According to the Jakarta Post Monday, a military officer given
the task of guarding Megawati Lt. Col. Henky Naulan was injured
following the blast of a homemade bomb during the unrest in Masohi
on Seram island.
</P>
<P>
Pattimura Military Commander Brig. Gen. Max Tamaela confirmed
the report, but said order in Masohi, about 2,500 kilometers
northeast of Jakarta, had been gradually restored as of Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
He added that he had ordered local military personnel to help
police hunt for the alleged mastermind of the communal clash, the
first since the 15-month conflict ended in March this year.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Produce Unleaded Gasoline in 2003 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's state oil company
Pertamina plans to abandon the production of leaded gasoline such
as Premium by replacing it with an unleaded fuel in the year 2003,
a report said.
</P>
<P>
The company aims to do its part in reducing air pollution by
producing only unleaded fuel to be called RON 88, Indonesian
Observer daily Monday quoted the head of Pertamina's Quality
Control Division, Zainal Abidin Thamrin, as saying at a seminar
held in Bandung, West Java, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the seminar which coincided with the commemoration
of the Earth Day, Zainal said that the 'blue sky' movement has
encouraged consumers to use unleaded gasoline.
</P>
<P>
He said Pertamina plans to produce its current unleaded premium
fuel, RON 92, at a rate of 6.6 million kilo-liters a year, while
public demand, which has been on the rise during the past few
months, is expected to reach 7.7 million kilo-liters.
</P>
<P>
"This increasing demand has encouraged Pertamina to produce
another unleaded fuel called RON 88, or PTT (premium without lead)
which will gradually replace the current Premium grade fuel," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that in the year 2003 demand for leaded premium
will be zero, while that for unleaded fuel will reach 11.2 million
kilo-liters in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A Philippine official confirmed
Monday that 72 of Flight 541's 131 dead passengers have been
identified by National Bureau of Investigation forensic experts,
the ABS-CBN news channel here said.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Secretary Jacinto Ortega of the Department of
Transportation and Communication was quoted as saying that
freezing the rest of the bodies may be imminent since the
identification process is expected to tak two more months.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ortega said the formation of an independent body for
the Air Philippines investigation is most certainly welcome to
avoid a whitewash in the probe.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing 737-200 with 124 passengers and seven crew members
on board crashed early last Wednesday morning in the small
southern island of Samal near Davao city. All the people aboard
have been confirmed dead.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Ortega said human error may have caused the air
tragedy. Initial findings showed that Flight 541 pilot may have "
misapproached" the plane's descent on the airport.
</P>
<P>
But he also stressed that the plane's cockpit voice recorder
and flight data recorder have been recovered and he hoped the two
recorders could unveil the real situation during the final minutes
before the crash.
</P>
<P>
People have to wait for two to three weeks for the
transcription of the information in the two recorders, other
reports said.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Police Crack Down on Illegal Dog Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A total of 95 dogs being
illegally sold at a market in a Beijing suburb were confiscated by
police after a surprise inspection, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
One person selling dogs was detained for interfering with
police when they confiscated the dogs Sunday, the English-language
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, the selling of all dogs are illegal, though dog
distribution can still be found in a few markets in the city's
suburban regions.
</P>
<P>
All the dogs confiscated by police will be fed and cared for at
a dog raising center managed by police.
</P>
<P>
The police action was to welcome the upcoming registration
period for those who want a dog for a pet, which has been May 1
and June 30 each year since 1995 when a local rule controlling the
raising of dogs took effect.
</P>
<P>
Without proper registration, having a dog is illegal in Beijing,
and dog owners might be fined between 200 yuan (about 24 US
dollars) and 5,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The city's police statistics showed that there are a total of
86,000 dogs raised in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
However, the actual number may be much bigger since many people
who have a dog never register them to avoid the high registry fees.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official of land
and resources has called for everyone involved in the development
of western China to protect the local geological environment,
China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Sun Wensheng, vice minister of Land and Resources, said that
the country's protection of its geological environment is still at
a "primitive stage" and some problems demand prompt solutions.
</P>
<P>
The development of western China should not repeat the mistakes
already made in some other Chinese regions, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Environmental depletion has occurred because some people
exploit resources at the expense of neglecting the environment.
</P>
<P>
Several karst caves millions of years old at Wudalianchi (five
connected volcanic lakes) in Heilongjiang Province were destroyed
because local people dug out stones to sell for money.
</P>
<P>
"We should not see such things happen again as we strive to
give the people in western China a better life," Sun was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
This could be achieved by establishing a special protective
program for the geological environment, completing the related
legal system, implementing strict laws and regulations and
stepping up a publicity campaign in the field, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, China lost about 30 billion yuan (
about 3.6 billion US dollars) last year in geological disasters,
more than half of them caused by men.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) -- "Shanghai Sweetheart" has become
one of the best-selling novels in China. Its author is a 27-year-
old woman.
</P>
<P>
Over 110,000 copies have been sold and this doesn't include

</P>
<P>
The author, Wei Hui, describes in the book a bustling Shanghai

The "new generation" are typically single children, and like to
keep up with the latest trends and fashions and just "wanna have
fun."
</P>
<P>
"Shanghai Sweetheart" is a story about a girl who finds herself
without a job after graduating from a well-known college. She goes

<HEADLINE> China to Build One-Tree Park (1)  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The construction of a one-tree park
occupying 26.7 hectares of land is underway in central China's
Hubei province.
</P>
<P>
The park is designed to protect the 600-year-old metasequoia in
Moudao County, southwestern Hubei Province in central China,
believed to be the ancestor of all metasequoia trees on the earth.
</P>
<P>
The 35-meter-high tree with a diameter of 2.4 meters is only 30
meters away from State Highway No. 318 linking Shanghai and Lhasa,
capital of Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Metasequoia, known as "plant giant panda", was first discovered
in China in 1941. Before that botanists around the world believed
that metasequoia had been extinct during the Quaternary Period (
some 2.5 million years ago to date) when huge glaciers covered
many parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
The roadside metasequoia came into the sight of Yu Duo, a
professor of forestry, in the winter of 1941 when he was bound for
Chongqing via Moudao County. It was later proved to be a
metasequoia tree after other experts studied the specimen.
</P>
<P>
The news was like an earth-shaking event among the global
botanical circles. Nearly 100 Chinese and foreign botanists
visited the metasequoia king over the past half a century and more.
</P>
<P>
Wei Mingdong, a 74-year-old farmer in the county, still
remembered that some foreigners come to see the tree when he was
only a teenager. "The Roman-nosed men and women, some with glasses,
took a close look at the tree. They even drilled holes in the tree
and took away with them some leaves and twigs," Wei said.
</P>
<P>
Wei did not understand then that the foreigners drilling holes
in the tree were trying to identify the age of the metasequoia. (

<P>
Chinese leaders Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping had presented
metasequoia seeds as precious gifts to other countries. Today
metasequoia can be seen in many parts of the world. All of them
are offspring of the one found in Moudao County. In China's Hubei
and Sichuan provinces, the posterity of the Moudao metasequoia
have amounted to more than 300 million.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Moudao County is pooling some 5.1 million yuan (
about 614,500 U.S. dollars) of fund to build a shelter for the "
super mother", the metasequoia king Park. Some 20 households will
move out from the future park. A 400-meter-long fence will be
built around the tree. The park is scheduled to be completed by
September, 2002.
</P>
<P>
As the metasequoia has become the symbol of Moudao County, the
local government spent 50,000 yuan (6,024 U.S. dollars) in the
early 1990s building a new channel for a river nearby which poses
a risk to water off the root of the giant tree. In 1995, a
lightening rod, which is two meters taller than the tree, was
erected to avoid lightening strikes.
</P>
<P>
The county has stipulated several rules to protect the
metasequoia, prohibiting people from climbing on the tree or
picking its branches, leaves or seeds.
</P>

As a matter of fact, the protection of the tree has become a
conscious action of the public, said Xiang Changmin, an official
with the county government, adding that no such cases damaging the
tree have occurred so far.

<P>
The writers describe different groups of people, such as bar
waitresses, extramarital lovers, and those who dyed their hair.
</P>
<P>
Compared with established older writers, the new generation are
more candid about people's inner thoughts and fears.
</P>
<P>
The works of Wei Hui and her contemporaries have triggered a
number of debates. Some say they lack social responsibility as
they fail to pay attention to mainstream society, others heap
praises on the literary talent saying their works represent a
cross-section of present-day life in urban China.
</P>
<P>
According to critics, these young writers represent the "new
generation" in major urban and coastal cities across China.
</P>
<P>
The generation have not experienced the ten years of
devastation during the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976). They have
been greatly influenced by the West, they follow the latest trends
and fashions and have become avid consumers.
</P>
<P>
"My descriptions portray my true feelings about a rapidly
changing society, and depicts young urban Chinese who are radical,
adventurous, liberal-minded, and confused," Wei said.
</P>
<P>
Although these post-1970 novels have their fair share of
critics, these novels have enriched writing in the reform period.
Lei Da, deputy director of the research department attached to the
All-China Writers' Association, pointed out that there is a more
open and relax atmosphere for Chinese writers to create their
works.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody has set rules on what writers should write. The market
determines the diversity of literary tastes and greatly enriches
people's thinking," said Lei.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that young writers must also cultivate morals
and not only describe reality in their works, but also develop a
deeper understanding of life.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China City Building More Small Towns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Shenyang, capital of northeast
China's Liaoning Province, plans to construct small towns in order
to promote economic development and accelerate the urbanization of
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
According to the Shenyang Municipal Government, by the year
2005 Shenyang will build 60 small towns, and by 2010, 70 new small
towns will be created.
</P>
<P>
The small towns are aimed at attracting rural and floating
laborers from other provinces, said a government official.
</P>
<P>
The towns are planned along six major railway lines from
Shenyang to the cities of Dalian, Changchun, Dandong, Shanhaiguan,
Panjin, and Fushun.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Shenyang has invested 1.29 billion yuan in the
construction of small towns.
</P>
<P>
Before 1985, the city had five towns in its suburbs, and by
1999 this number had reached 62. There are now 3,300 collectively
and privately owned enterprises employing 120,000 people in these
towns.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the small towns
reached 18.54 billion yuan, accounting for 40.8 percent of the GDP
in Shenyang's rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The annual income per capita in the small towns was 3,694 yuan,
higher than the average income of farmers in the city.
</P>
<P>
According to a city government plan, by 2015 the population of
the small towns in Shenyang will reach 2.14 million people,
accounting for 60 percent of the city's population in rural areas.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 22 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Mary Pierce of France
easily beat fourth-seeded Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain 6-1, 6-
0 to win the title of the women's tennis tournament at Hilton Head
Island, South Carolina on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Pierce only spent 56 minutes to defeat her rival in the final.
In Saturday's semi-final, Pierce needed 68 minutes to eliminate
the American Monica Seles.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Pierce nailed 27 winners to just five for
Sanchez Vicario. Pierce had 15 unforced errors, enough to give the
Spaniard a couple of openings that Pierce quickly closed.
</P>
<P>
In the tournament, other than her big forehands and well-placed
backhands, Pierce used her powerful serve as a key weapon.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 23 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer club
Arsenal moved consolidated their grip of a place in next season's
Champions League when they defeated Watford 3-2 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The result sent the losers back to the first division after one
season in the English premier league.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's other match, Leeds United let a 2-0 lead slip at
Newcastle United in a 2-2 draw which stretches their run without a
win to eight matches - six of them defeats.
</P>
<P>
The results mean that Arsenal, who on Thursday qualified for
the UEFA Cup final against Galatasaray, stay third on 63 points,
two clear of Leeds and with a game in hand.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United clinched the title with 79 points on Saturday

a game in hand on Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea, in fifth place, have 59 points and it is looking
increasingly likely that they will only qualify for a European

STOCKHOLM, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Sweden beat Switzerland 6-2 in
a ice hockey warm-up match before the World Championships in the
Swedish industrial city Linkoeping on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The two teams are not in the same class. The Swedish team
belongs to the first class. The Swiss is one class lower. So it is
not unexpectable that the Swedes won Swiss so easily.
</P>
<P>
In the first and second periods the Swedes were not too strong
and led only by two goals. But in the third one they showed their
superiority and netted three goals and lost only one goal.
</P>
<P>
This is the third warm-up match for the Swedes. In the first
two matches they drew 1-1 with the Finnish team.
</P>
<P>
The World Ice Hockey Championships will start next week in St

CAIRO, April 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan's share of drugs and medicines in the Iraqi
market is currently estimated at 11 to 15 percent, compared with
about 60 percent previously, said Chairman of the Jordanian
Federation of Medicines Producers Mazin Drouza.
</P>
<P>
Some Jordanian drugs companies incurred losses last year
estimated at about 3 million dinars (4.2 million U.S. dollars). And
the total losses of Jordanian medicine companies will amount to
some 30 million dinars (42 million dollars) in 1999, said the
chairman.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's medicine is facing competition because it is treated in
Baghdad on an equal footing with medicine produced by other foreign
companies.
</P>
<P>
JEDDAH -- Saudi citizens spend about 17 billion U.S. dollars
every year on entertainment and tourism, while the national
investments on domestic tourism since 1995 have reached more than
6.4 billion dollars, said Chairman of the board of directors of the
Saudi Company For Exhibitions Abdul Aziz el-Nwaiser.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is regarded as the biggest tourism exporting
country in the region, which means that Saudi citizens rank the
first in terms of spending on tourism worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Saudi Arabia ranks the 11th as far as world
touristic spending is concerned. Some studies estimate that Saudis
spend around 8 billion dollars aboard every year.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey's construction sector is turning from
traditional markets to new potential markets, reported the Anatolia
News Agency on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Contractors Union Chairman Kadir Sever said that because
Russian, Libyan and Middle East markets were not very promising
this year, Turkish construction companies were in search for
projects in Africa, South America, Pakistan, India, Vietnam,
Malaysia and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
He said that Turkish companies should also benefit from growing
opportunities in eastern Europe and the future potential in
southeastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- An international petroleum company has offered to
establish a project to convert Egyptian natural gas into butane gas
and fuel. The landmark project would ensure that Egypt makes
optimum utilization of its natural gas at home rather than for
export, said Minister of Petroleum Sameh Samir Fahmi on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Fahmi said his ministry plans to intensify drilling operations
for petroleum and natural gas to cope with spiralling domestic
consumption. And the ministry is also studying the possibility of
amending petroleum agreements in order to attract more foreign
investments to this strategic sector.

<HEADLINE> Syria Never to Yield Any of its Rights: Ruling Party Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Syria would never yield an inch
of its territories, a drop of its water or any of its rights, said
Assistant Secretary General of the ruling Baath Arab Socialist
Party Soliman Qaddah here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Qaddah made the pledge while addressing the opening session of
the four-day sixth congress of the Syrian Revolutionary Youth
Federation.
</P>
<P>
Syria wants to establish a just and comprehensive peace in the
Middle East, and responds positively and sincerely to the
international efforts to this end under the relevant U.N. Security
Council resolutions and the principles of the Madrid peace
conference, including the land-for-peace principle, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Syria will neither accept any compromise nor negotiate
on its demand for Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights to the
border lines prior to the June 4, 1967, Middle East war, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The demand is legal and falls within the framework of the U.N.
resolutions, Qaddah added.
</P>
<P>
"Syria will never yield an inch of its territories, a drop of
its water, or any of its rights. It will never accept any pressures
whatever the challenges or the time might be," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"Is Syria asked to abandon the U.N. resolutions or give its
rights and territories up?" he wondered. "If this was a question,
peace would be far-fetched and impossible," he commented.
</P>
<P>
"The region will not enjoy stability and security and will be
vulnerable to all possibilities unless Israel pulls out from the
Golan Heights and south Lebanon to the borders of June 4, 1967, and
recognizes the rights of the Palestinian people," Qaddah warned.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli peace talks, which were resumed in Washington
last December after a nearly four-year freeze, have been stalled
since January due to Israel's refusal to make a written commitment
to a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which Israel captured
from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
A summit meeting, held last month in Geneva between U.S.
President Bill Clinton and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, failed
to bring the two sides back to the negotiating table. And
international efforts to relaunch the talks as soon as possible are
underway.
</P>
<P>
The main differences between Syria and Israel center on the
sovereignty over the Tiberias Lake. Syria wants to restore its
sovereignty over the northeastern coast of the lake, while Israel
wants to control the lake fully.
</P>
<P>
There are suggestions to launch joint tourist projects between
the two countries, a nature reserve or a free trade zone, but
Israel insists on its claim to full control over the lake.
</P>
<P>
Qaddah accused Israel of trouble-making and setting obstacles on
the road to peace. He held Israel responsible for the deadlock of
the Syrian-Israeli talks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he urged for Arab solidarity, joint action, single
rank and common stand in the face of Israel's intransigence and
denial of Arab rights.

<HEADLINE> Mexico and Seven Other Countries Launch Declaration On Nuclear Weapon Free World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Mexico, Brazil, Egypt,
Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa and Sweden on Monday
jointly launched the Declaration" Towards a Nuclear Weapon Free
World: The Need for a New Agenda" at the 2000 Review Conference of
the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons(NPT).
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the seven other countries, Ms. Rosario Green,
Minister For Foreign Affairs of Mexico, told the general debate of
the 2000 NPT Review Conference which will be held here at the
Headquarters of the United Nations in New York From April 24 to
May 19 "Our purpose in taking such an initiative was to put the
nuclear agenda back on track, to give a clear perspective and
underpinning through a new and clear undertaking to bring about a
nuclear free world without further prevarication"
</P>
<P>
"The new agenda is a program of action sufficiently flexible
to adapt to the circumstances and requirements of each successive
stage in the process that leads to the achievement of a world
without nuclear weapons," she said.
</P>
<P>
 "It captures the elements of ongoing processes. And, in a
pragmatic and realistic way it brings together successive steps
for the international community to implement the obligations of
the treaty," the Minister said.
</P>
<P>
"Fundamental to this initiative is the requirement for an
unequivocal undertaking on the part of the five nuclear weapons
states to the total elimination of their respective nuclear
arsenals. Such a commitment would be new," she said.
</P>
<P>
 "It would determine all future action on the part of the
nuclear weapons states. It would provide a reference point to
evaluate progress towards the goals of the NPT, when we again meet
in 2005 to review the implementation of the Treaty. And it would
signal determination to uphold disarmament imperatives," she added.
</P>
<P>
 The main points of the Declaration:
</P>
<P>
 -- The five nuclear-weapon states make an unequivocal
undertake to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear
arsenals and, in the course of the forthcoming Review period 2000-
2005, to engage in an accelerated process of negotiations and to
take steps leading to nuclear disarmament to which all states
parties are committed under Article VI.
</P>
<P>
-- The united States of America and the Russian Federation
undertake to fully implement the Treaty on Further Reduction and
Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms (START II) and commence
without further delay negotiations on START III with a view to its
early conclusion.
</P>
<P>
-- The nuclear-weapon states undertake to proceed to the early
integration of all five nuclear-weapons states into the process
leading to the total elimination of their respective nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
-- The five nuclear-weapon states undertake, as early and
interim steps, to adapt their nuclear policies and posture so as
to preclude the use of nuclear weapons and so on.
</P>
<P>
 -- States parties agree on the importance and urgency of the
pursuit, extension and establishment of nuclear weapon free zones,
on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at, among States of
the regions concerned, especially in regions of tension, such as
the Middle East and South Asia, as significant contribution to a
nuclear-weapon-free-world.
</P>
<P>
-- The States parties call upon the three States that operate
unsafeguarded nuclear facilities and that have not yet acceded to
the Treaty on NPT and that have not renounced the nuclear-weapons
option to reverse clearly and urgently the pursuit of all nuclear
weapons development or deployment and to refrain from any action
that could undermine regional and international peace and security
and the efforts of the international community towards nuclear
disarmament and the prevention of the proliferation of nuclear
weapons.

<HEADLINE> China Opposes Nuclear Non-proliferation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China pursues a policy of not endorsing, encouraging or
engaging in nuclear weapons proliferation, neither will it assist
other countries in developing nuclear weapons nor provide any
assistance to the nuclear facilities not subject to the safeguards
of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Ambassador Sha
Zukang said.
</P>
<P>
The month-long conference opened Monday is to review the
implementation in the past five years of the Non-Proliferation
Treaty (NPT) reached in 1970 with 187 signatories now.
</P>
<P>
China has been abided by the three principles of nuclear export,
i.e., nuclear export is conducted only for peaceful purposes and
subject to IAEA safeguards, and the receiving party shall not make
a transfer to the third country without China's permission, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Further explaining China's position on non-proliferation, Sha
said more efforts should be made to establish a global security
environment of stability, cooperation and mutual trust, which will
constitute the basic guarantee for the prevention of nuclear
proliferation.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, he said, the prerequisite for the success of nuclear
non-proliferation should be the abolishment of the double or multi-
standards in the field of nuclear non-proliferation.
</P>
<P>
Sha also noted that the only correct and effective way to solve
non-proliferation is to enhance international cooperation and
common efforts within a framework of collective security.
</P>
<P>
Any trend or action of unilateralism runs counter to the main
tide of the non-proliferation efforts, the Chinese official said.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Withdraws Forces From Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has withdrawn two
battalions of the Uganda People's Defense Forces (UPDF) deployed
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Radio Uganda
reported Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
The returned forces were led by the 55th battalion commander
Major Sam Bishuba and the 31st battalion commander Major Isaac
Katongole, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The mission of wiping out the rebel Allied Democratic Forces
(ADF) has been accomplished, the two commanders told reporters at
Karungibate Detachment in Kasese district.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the withdrawal was in part due to the
surrendering of ADF's two senior officers to the Ugandan
government.
</P>
<P>
ADF's Chief of Staff One Benzi and Chief of Training and
Operations One Rwigyema Junior have given up a very useless,
costly and senseless war against the Ugandan government, they
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Benzi has apologized to all Ugandans
for the havoc created ever since he joined ADF rebels in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Observers noted that the withdrawal came after the one-day
regional summit on the peace process in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The summit, which was held in Zimbabwe last Friday, reviewed
the progress so far made in implementing the Lusaka Cease-fire
Agreement and discussed other issues concerning the conflict and
the peace prospects in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan forces moved into the DRC before August 1998 when the
conflict broke out between the DRC government forces and the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government said it had deployed forces in the DRC
in a bid to fight against the anti-government rebels of the ADF.

<HEADLINE> (rpt with correction)Mexico and Six Other Countries Launch Declaration on Nuclear Weapon Free World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Mexico, Brazil, Egypt,
Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa and Sweden on Monday jointly
launched the Declaration" Towards a Nuclear Weapon Free World: The
Need for a New Agenda" at the 2000 Review Conference of the
Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons(
NPT).
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the six other countries, Ms. Rosario Green,
Minister For Foreign Affairs of Mexico, told the general debate of
the 2000 NPT Review Conference which will be held here at the
Headquarters of the United Nations in New York from April 24 to
May 19 "Our purpose in taking such an initiative was to put the
nuclear agenda back on track, to give a clear perspective and
underpinning through a new and clear undertaking to bring about a
nuclear free world without further prevarication."
</P>
<P>
"The new agenda is a program of action sufficiently flexible
to adapt to the circumstances and requirements of each successive
stage in the process that leads to the achievement of a world
without nuclear weapons," she said.
</P>
<P>
 "It captures the elements of ongoing processes. And, in a
pragmatic and realistic way it brings together successive steps
for the international community to implement the obligations of
the treaty," the Minister said.
</P>
<P>
"Fundamental to this initiative is the requirement for an
unequivocal undertaking on the part of the five nuclear weapons
states to the total elimination of their respective nuclear
arsenals. Such a commitment would be new," she said.
</P>
<P>
 "It would determine all future action on the part of the
nuclear weapons states. It would provide a reference point to
evaluate progress towards the goals of the NPT, when we again meet
in 2005 to review the implementation of the Treaty. And it would
signal determination to uphold disarmament imperatives," she added.
</P>
<P>
 The main points of the Declaration:
</P>
<P>
 -- The five nuclear-weapon states make an unequivocal
undertake to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear
arsenals and, in the course of the forthcoming Review period 2000-
2005, to engage in an accelerated process of negotiations and to
take steps leading to nuclear disarmament to which all states
parties are committed under Article VI.
</P>
<P>
-- The united States of America and the Russian Federation
undertake to fully implement the Treaty on Further Reduction and
Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms (START II) and commence
without further delay negotiations on START III with a view to its
early conclusion.
</P>
<P>
-- The nuclear-weapon states undertake to proceed to the early
integration of all five nuclear-weapons states into the process
leading to the total elimination of their respective nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
-- The five nuclear-weapon states undertake, as early and
interim steps, to adapt their nuclear policies and posture so as
to preclude the use of nuclear weapons and so on.
</P>
<P>
 -- States parties agree on the importance and urgency of the
pursuit, extension and establishment of nuclear weapon free zones,
on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at, among States of
the regions concerned, especially in regions of tension, such as
the Middle East and South Asia, as significant contribution to a
nuclear-weapon-free-world.
</P>
<P>
-- The States parties call upon the three States that operate
unsafeguarded nuclear facilities and that have not yet acceded to
the Treaty on NPT and that have not renounced the nuclear-weapons
option to reverse clearly and urgently the pursuit of all nuclear
weapons development or deployment and to refrain from any action
that could undermine regional and international peace and security
and the efforts of the international community towards nuclear
disarmament and the prevention of the proliferation of nuclear
weapons.

<HEADLINE> Albright: U.S. Remains Committed to NPT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine K. Albright defended her country's policy at a U.N.
Nuclear Non-Proliferation (NPT) Treaty Review Conference, assuring
the critics of U.S. commitment to a world free of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
At the opening session of the month-long conference, Albright
said she and President Bill Clinton were convinced that America
would ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate rejected the CTBT last October, becoming the
first and only legislature of any state to reject the treaty. It
was widely seen as a heavy blow to the world's non-proliferation
process. The failure, coupled with the U.S. efforts to develop and
deploy a national missile defense system, triggered off sharp
criticism from many countries and non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
The CTBT, opened for signature in 1996, prohibits all nuclear
test explosions in any environment and sets up a far-ranging
international monitoring system. The recent approval of the CTBT
by Russia's Duma has put the U.S. at a tight corner.
</P>
<P>
"The failure of the Senate to ratify the CTBT makes the U.S.
something of a non-proliferation 'rogue' state," said Dary Kimball,
director of the alliance of 17 organizations struggling to reduce
nuclear dangers.
</P>
<P>
Russia threatened to withdraw from its Start II agreement with
the U.S. if Washington would go ahead with its plan to establish
the national missile shield. The U.S. bid to revise its
Antiballistic Missile (ABM) treaty signed with the Soviet Union in
1972 has provoked suspicions from Russia, China and even among its
allies.
</P>
<P>
Albright admitted that the missile defense plan had caused "
border concerns." But she denied that Washington was intent to
sabotage the ABM Treaty.
</P>
<P>
"If the Clinton Administration were bent on sabotaging the ABM
Treaty and strategic arms control, we have surely gone about it in
a strange way -- in the open, with care, and in consultation not
only with Congress, but after extensive discussions with our
allies and other countries, Russia and China emphatically included,
" she said shortly after her arrival from Washington.
</P>
<P>
The secretary of state argued that the treaty had been amended
before and there was no good reason it cannot be amended again to
"reflect new threats from third countries outside the strategic
deterrence system."
</P>
<P>
"And please remember that we are talking about a system
capable of defending against at most a few tens of incoming
missiles. It is not intended to degrade Russia's deterrent. Nor
will it have that result," said the U.S. official.
</P>
<P>
Russia is expected to respond Tuesday when its representative
is to address the conference.
</P>
<P>
Albright vowed to help President Clinton to win senators'
final endorsement of the CTBT. However, she failed to give a road
map. She cautioned against "unrealistic and premature measures."
</P>
<P>
"We share the frustration many feel about the pace if progress
toward a world free of nuclear weapons. But we also know that if
countries demand unrealistic and premature measures, they will
harm the NPT and set back everyone's cause," she said.
</P>
<P>
She did not elaborate. But it was understood that she was
responding to the calls for quicker and firmer U.S. actions.
</P>
<P>
"We know the path toward our shared destination. The hard work
of peace requires putting one foot patiently in front of the other,
" she added.

WASHINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Seven people, including at
least one child, were shot at the National Zoo in Washington
Monday night, the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Brian Lee, spokesman for the District of Columbia Fire and

</P>
<P>
There was no immediate word of any arrests or the conditions of

At least two of the victims were shot at the zoo's visitors
center and one was shot at the zoo entrance on Connecticut Avenue,
a main thoroughfare in the northwest section of the U.S. capital.

</P>
<P>
Police helicopters hovered over the zoo after the shootings as
authorities sought a gunman. The incident took place as the zoo, a
unit of the Smithsonian Institution, was playing host to an
African-American family celebration day.

At least two of the victims were shot at the zoo's visitors

<HEADLINE> Albright Expected to Travel to Mideast in 6-8 Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright is expected to travel to the Middle East in six
to eight weeks amid highly intensive talks between Israel and the
Palestinians, the State Department said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The next six to eight weeks could well be a decisive phase in
the pursuit of peace between the Palestinians and Israelis,"
spokesman James Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"And I would say that we also would expect, at the appropriate
time, for Secretary Albright to travel to the region," he added.
</P>
<P>
Rubin also announced that U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross would
leave for the region early next week to take part in the new round
of talks between Israeli and Palestinian negotiators at the Red
Sea port of Eilat.
</P>
<P>
In addition to sitting at the table with the Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators in Eilat, where discussions are scheduled
to last for two weeks with more active U.S. participation, Ross
also is slated to travel to meet with Israeli and Palestinian
leaders and shuttle back and forth between them.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said Albright would assess whether a U.S.-Mideast summit
would be appropriate and prepare the ground if it were.
</P>
<P>
"When the secretary travels, if she travels as we would expect
she would, she'd obviously be in a position to make a
recommendation to the president as to whether a summit would be or
would not be useful," he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past weeks U.S. President Bill Clinton met separately
with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinians leader
Yasser Arafat in an attempt to revitalize the virtually stalled
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. And observers here say new
impetus was given to the process. Still no evidence has been shown
for a breakthrough.

<HEADLINE> China Not to Be First to Use Nuclear Weapons: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China has unconditionally undertaken not to be the first to use
nuclear weapons and not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons
against non-nuclear-weapon states or nuclear-weapon-free zones,
head of the Chinese delegation to the conference Sha Zukang said.
</P>
<P>
China has never avoided its responsibilities and obligations in
nuclear disarmament and has been advocating the complete
prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons,
Ambassador Sha said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that there are two basic prerequisites for China
to participate in any arms control negotiations: these
negotiations and the treaties or agreements reached must not
undermine the global strategic balance and stability, or China's
important strategic security interests.
</P>
<P>
The month-long conference will be addressed by foreign
ministers or senior officials on how to promote the implementation
of the NPT reached in 1970 with a total of 187 signatories now.
</P>
<P>
The treaty prohibits direct or indirect transfer of nuclear
weapons by nuclear states to non-nuclear-weapon states, and
commits non-nuclear-weapon states to not conducting research on or
manufacturing or receiving nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
At the opening session Monday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan painted a somber picture on global disarmament: some 35,000
nuclear weapons remain in the nuclear arsenals with thousands of
them on hair-trigger alert, while much of the multilateral
disarmament machinery has started to rust due to the lack of
political will to use it.

<HEADLINE> NMD Criticized at NPT Review Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sha Zukang, head of the Chinese delegation to the conference,
said the development of the NMD system by "a certain military
power" will bring severe damage to the integrity and vitality of
the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty concluded in 1972 by
Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The move will undermine the global strategic balance and
stability and inevitably harm the basis for the U.S-Russia
bilateral nuclear disarmament, and impede the international
nuclear disarmament process, shaking the prerequisite and basis
for international nuclear non-proliferation, Ambassador Sha said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in his address, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said
the growing pressure (in the U.S.) to deploy NMD is jeopardizing
the ABM Treaty and "could well lead to a new arms race, setbacks
for nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, and create new
incentives for missile proliferation."
</P>
<P>
The month-long review conference will discuss universality of
the NPT, compliance by unclear and non-nuclear-weapon states and
other related issues.
</P>
<P>
The NPT concluded in 1970 with a total of 187 signatories
prohibits the transfer of nuclear weapons by nuclear states and
bars non-nuclear-weapon states from manufacturing and receiving
such weapons.

<HEADLINE> Japan Says to Make Proposal on Full Compliance With NPT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Japan said Monday that it
tended to make a proposal to the Sates Parties on several specific
points which are essential to the full and expeditious
implementation of the Principles and Objectives of 1995 and the
full compliance with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons (NPT).
</P>
<P>
The statement was made by Ichita Yamamoto, state secretary for
foreign affairs of Japan at the general debate of the 2000 NPT
Review Conference which is held at the Headquarters of the United
Nations in New York from April 24 to May 19.
</P>
<P>
Yamamoto said nuclear non-proliferation has clearly suffered a
setback since 1995 due to several events, namely, the nuclear
tests conducted in South Asia, the delay in the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty (CTBT)'s entry into force even after three and a half
years since it was opened for signature, the failure to commence
the Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty negotiations despite the
agreement to do so at the Geneva Conference on Disarmament in 1995,
and the launching of missiles by several countries.
</P>
<P>
In the face of these unfavorable circumstances, this Review
Conference was all the more important, he said, adding, "This
meeting is the first Review Conference since the NPT was
indefinitely extended, and is considered a touchstone as to
whether the NPT can preserve and even enhance its credibility and
its universality."
</P>
<P>
Yamamoto said Japan welcomed Russia's recent ratification of
START II as an encouraging step, and called upon it and the United
States to commence negotiations on START III at the earliest date
possible.
</P>
<P>
Saying that the CTBT and the Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty
were the two important pillars of the NPT regime, Yamamoto
welcomed Russia's Duma's adoption of the bill for the CTBT
ratification last week and urged key countries, including the
United States and China, to ratify it as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
According to diplomats here, Japan's intended proposal will
include the completion by 2003 or 2005 as the latest negotiations
on a cut-off treaty banning the production of nuclear fissile
materials, and the early implementation of the CTBT on nuclear
weapons.

<HEADLINE> U.S. National Archives Subpoenaed in White House E-mail Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Independent Counsel
Robert Ray has issued a subpoena to the National Archives in a
White House E-mail case, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ray, who succeeded former Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr
last year, is trying to determine whether White House officials
hid e-mails to obstruct investigations ranging from Whitewater to
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
Ray's office issued the grand jury subpoena last Tuesday to the
government's official record keeper which has advised the White
House on archiving its electronic mail.
</P>
<P>
The office and the Justice Department's campaign fund-raising
task force are conducting a joint investigation into the e-mail
controversy to determine why the White House failed to review
thousands of e-mails.
</P>
<P>
In response, the National Archives said it will comply with the
subpoena.
</P>
<P>
"The National Archives received a grand jury subpoena from the
independent counsel relating to record-keeping practices in the
executive office of the president and intends to comply as
required," archives spokeswoman Susan Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
The White House has blamed a computer glitch and says there was
no effort to hide the e-mail from investigators.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to work hard to reconstruct and search the backup
tapes and produce any relevant information," White House spokesman
Jim Kennedy said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"But I don't have immediate comment on that subpoena. We've
been very clear about the fact that we are cooperating fully with
Congress and others who have an interest in this case."

<HEADLINE> (RPT With Correction) China Opposes Nuclear Proliferation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China pursues a policy of not endorsing, encouraging or
engaging in nuclear weapons proliferation, neither will it assist
other countries in developing nuclear weapons nor provide any
assistance to the nuclear facilities not subject to the safeguards
of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Ambassador Sha
Zukang said.
</P>
<P>
The month-long conference opened Monday is to review the
implementation in the past five years of the Non-Proliferation
Treaty (NPT) reached in 1970 with 187 signatories now.
</P>
<P>
China has been abided by the three principles of nuclear export,
i.e., nuclear export is conducted only for peaceful purposes and
subject to IAEA safeguards, and the receiving party shall not make
a transfer to the third country without China's permission, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Further explaining China's position on non-proliferation, Sha
said more efforts should be made to establish a global security
environment of stability, cooperation and mutual trust, which will
constitute the basic guarantee for the prevention of nuclear
proliferation.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, he said, the prerequisite for the success of nuclear
non-proliferation should be the abolishment of the double or multi-
standards in the field of nuclear non-proliferation.
</P>
<P>
Sha also noted that the only correct and effective way to solve
non-proliferation is to enhance international cooperation and
common efforts within a framework of collective security.
</P>
<P>
Any trend or action of unilateralism runs counter to the main
tide of the non-proliferation efforts, the Chinese official said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's army increased its
seizures of marihuana and heroin in the country but registered a
considerable decrease in its seizure of cocaine, said authorities
from the Secretariat of National Defense (Sedena) Monday.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, marihuana seized reached 312,197 kilos and
heroin 2.5 kilos, while all last year they reached 713,600 kilos
and 4.7 kilos respectively, said sources from the Sedena Monday.
</P>
<P>
Cocaine confiscating went down drastically. From January to
April it came to 31.9 kilograms while last year it came to 4,878
kilos.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the eradication of illicit plantations, military
authorities said they came from January to April to 4,200 hectares
of marihuana and 3,382 hectares of poppy, while last year they
came to 25,628 hectares and 12,136 hectares respectively.
</P>
<P>
These figures indicate that in this year's first quarter, the
army destroyed 16 percent more of marihuana extensions than last
year and 28 percent of poppy ones.
</P>
<P>
Mexican anti-drug authorities said that in 1999 states where
the largest number of marihuana cultivations were destroyed were
Sinaloa, Michoacan, Guerrero, Chihuahua, Durango, Oaxaca and
Jalisco, in this order.
</P>
<P>
The states of Guerrero, Sinaloa, Chihuahua, Durango, Oaxaca and
Nayarit were in this order where the greatest destruction of poppy
sowings in 1999 was achieved.
</P>
<P>
According to Sedena, the army and air force used last year 26,
797 elements daily in anti-drug operations in the country.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Condemns U.S. Tuna Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Mexican authorities said
Monday the tuna embargo imposed during almost 10 years by the
United States upon the country had adverse consequences,
especially for the Mexican state of Lower California.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the embargo, there were 70 tuna boats
functioning at Ensenada port, northern Lower California, while at
the end of last year there were 39, said Economic Development
Secretary Jose Antonoiio Martinez in a communique.
</P>
<P>
Tuna unloading went down from 53,000 tons in 1991 to 36,000 in
1999. Meanwhile, 2,000 jobs were lost, particularly in Ensenada,
owing to the cancellation of exports, he said.
</P>
<P>
Martinez considered as a triumph the rejection by a judge from
New York state last week of the claims by American ecological
groups for Washington to keep an embargo upon this Latin American
country.
</P>
<P>
On April 12, the U.S. Trade Department lifted the tuna embargo
imposed 10 years ago upon Mexico and other nations because they
considerably reduced or eliminated the killing of dolphins during
tuna capture.
</P>
<P>
Tuna represents 90 percent of fish taking in Lower California,
and in view of the prevailing situation, local fishing has been
seriously affected in spite of the attainment of new markets, like
Italy, Spain, Japan and Colombia, he added.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide PC Market Experiences Two-Digit Growth in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 24 (Xinhua) -- Worldwide PC market expanded
by a big margin in the first quarter of 2000 as compared with a
year ago, according to preliminary estimates released Monday by
two U.S. market research firms.
</P>
<P>
International Data Corporation (IDC) reported that worldwide PC
market volume expanded 20 percent year over year, with shipments
totaling 30.4 million units, while Dataquest estimated a 15
percent growth with shipments surpassing 29.9 million units.
</P>
<P>
Both firms listed strong growth in Asia-Pacific and Japan as
the leading factor behind the worldwide market expansion.
</P>
<P>
According to IDC, the Asia-Pacific region (excluding Japan) and
Japan registered year-to-year growth of 36 percent and 35 percent
respectively. As in other parts of the world, consumer sales and
rapidly expanding interest in the Internet drove PC demand. In the
United States, which totaled 11.6 million units on year-to-year
growth of 17 percent, consumer PC interest remained high.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Asian markets, Dataquest said that growth in South
Korea was especially strong as a result of government initiatives
to drive investment and Japan's growth was also related to these
issues coupled with a traditional strength of the first quarter.
Latin America had a healthy quarter with the consumer segment
performing well, the firm said.
</P>
<P>
IDC predicted that commercial market demand has started to
stabilize in most major regions of the world, and purchase
patterns should return to more normal rates during the second half
of the year.
