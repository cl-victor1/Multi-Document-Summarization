<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Won Continues Depreciation While Shares Tumbling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar soared to 2,000
against the South Korean won Tuesday from the previous day's 1,850
at the Seoul foreign exchange market, the first time in history.
</P>
<P>
In the meanwhile, the composite stock price index plunged 29.7
points, or 7.5 percent to 366.36 points, an unprecedented loss in
history, with a turnover standing at 85.89 million shares worth 1
trillion won (615.93 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Market officials attributed the won's sharp depreciation to
"unnecessary uneasiness" caused by reports of an acute shortage of
foreign exchange in near future.
</P>
<P>
The worsening situation came a day after some international
financial organizations further downgraded the country's credit in the
world's financial market.
</P>
<P>
The downgrading credit is expected to worsen the foreign-currency
situation and the Korean conglomerates and financial institutions will
find it nearly impossible to secure hard currency from abroad,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has been in serious financial crisis caused by the
collapse of a group of conglomerates and bad loans of financial
institutions. It has signed an agreement with the International
Monetary Fund for a bailout loan valued at 57 billion U.S. dollars
with tough conditions.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, South Korea will restructure its economy, open
its financial market and cut its budget while it has to face massive
layoffs.

<HEADLINE> US Factory Orders for Durable Goods Rise 4.8 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Orders to U.S. factories
for durable goods went up 4.8 percent in November, the largest
increase in five years, the Commerce Department reported here
today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that orders for durable goods, products
expected to last more than three years, totaled a record,
seasonally adjusted 195 billion U.S. dollars, up from 186.1
billion dollars in October.
</P>
<P>
It was the biggest advance since a 7.5 percent growth in
December 1992.
</P>
<P>
Transportation orders shot up 20.3 percent, the biggest gain
since a 38.2 percent jump in July 1991. If excluding
transportation, orders slipped 0.2 percent, the second straight
decline.
</P>
<P>
Orders for primary metals climbed up 3.2 percent and for
electronic and other electrical equipment, up 0.1 percent. But
orders for industrial machinery and equipment fell 1.6 percent,
the third drop in four months.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, orders for military goods shot up by 24.9 percent
after falling 13.5 percent a month earlier. Orders for nonmilitary
capital goods excluding aircraft fell 2 percent, the second
straight decrease
</P>
<P>
The backlog of unfilled orders increased 2.4 percent, the sixth
increase in the last seven months. A growing backlog often
suggests businesses are unable to meet demand with current
facilities and manpower.
</P>
<P>
But shipments, a measure of current demand, fell l0.4 percent,
the third drop in four months.

<HEADLINE> Eating Chicken Is Safe: HK Health Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Eating chicken is safe so
long as they are well-cooked, a Hong Kong health official said
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But anyone who has been in contact with chicken should wash the
hands thoroughly, said Paul Saw, Deputy Director of Health and
Chairman of the Inter-Department Coordinating Committee on
Influenza A H5N1.
</P>
<P>
The export of chicken from China's inland to Hong Kong would be
temporarily suspended from Tuesday midnight to allow for
appropriate controls to be instructed, said Saw.
</P>
<P>
This voluntary measure by the inland authorities was revealed
at a press conference after the committee's meeting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Evidence so far suggested exposure to chicken or its feces as a
possible source of infection of the avian virus, while direct
man-to-man transmission needed to be determined, he said.
</P>
<P>
The virus could be easily killed through cleansing using common
disinfectants, he added.
</P>
<P>
The temporary suspension was introduced as a precautionary
measure and to ensure the health status of chickens imported into
Hong Kong in the future, said Leslie Sims, senior veterinary
officer of the Agriculture and Fisheries Department (AFD), at the
press conference.
</P>
<P>
When chickens are imported again from the inland, the AFD would
have to be in place for screening for evidence of Flu A infection
using a rapid blood test for imported birds.
</P>
<P>
"The laboratory would be working shifts to ensure that initial
testing is completed before the birds are sold the following
morning," Sims said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime. the AFD would continue testing all local
chicken farms for the H5N1 virus, with such testing to be
completed within 10 days.
</P>
<P>
Results available so far found H5N1 virus in two swabs of
chicken droppings collected 10 days ago from two market stalls and
the whole batch of chickens had been handed over to AFD for
destruction and the market stalls were thoroughly cleansed
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The AFD would continue to monitor the situation and take
appropriate action where necessary," he said.
</P>
<P>
The preventive measures which had been proposed by the
Inter-Department Coordinating Committee had been implemented
smoothly, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Health has stepped up surveillance for Flu A
H5N1 at public clinics and hospitals since early this month and
private doctors had been solicited, for any more cases of
infection of the virus to be picked up, Saw said.

<HEADLINE> Faction Leaders Foresee Peace in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Somalia's faction leaders today
voiced the conviction that peace and stability will prevail in
their country.
</P>
<P>
The Somali Declaration of Principles signed here Monday will
work to end the conflicts, and bring peace and reconciliation to
Somalia, said Hussein Mohamed Aideed and Ali Mahdi Mohammed after
meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
Aideed, leader of the Somali National Alliance, said they
discussed with Moussa the declaration and issues related to its
implementation.
</P>
<P>
He said the declaration would furnish the "cornerstone for
realizing Somalia's national unity."
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi, leader of the 26-faction National Salvation Council,
chimed in with Aideed to seek the support of the Arab League and
the international community to restore stability to the nation of
the Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Aideed and Mahdi, leaders of Somalia's strongest factions,
signed the declaration, the country's first comprehensive
power-sharing agreement, which calls for independence, integrity
and security of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Under the declaration, Somalia will hold a National
Reconciliation Conference to elect a 13-member Presidential
Council, set up a national government, Council of Deputies and
independent judicial body.
</P>
<P>
If the declaration works, it will help form the first unified
national government in Somalia since the 1991 ouster of the late
dictator Mohamed Siad Barre.
</P>
<P>
Since then Somalia has been fragmented into fiefdoms protected
by faction leaders, who have never fully carried out the peace
deals reached between them. The factional armed conflicts,
combined with a 1992 famine, have claimed about 300,000 lives.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot FM Proposes Meeting with Turkish FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Foreign Minister
Ioannis Kasoulides has proposed a meeting with his Turkish
counterpart Ismail Cem to exchange views on the solution of
the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters here today, Kasoulides said "only if
there is a public exchange of views and positions between
Turkey and Cyprus, will Ankara be convinced to advise Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash to change his position on the
solution to the Cyprus problem."
</P>
<P>
He said he has proposed to Cem to meet "when and where" he
wants, not to negotiate a Cyprus settlement but to exchange
views.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides revealed he had conveyed a similar invitation to
Cem in the past through a third party which he did not name.
</P>
<P>
His proposal was rejected, he said, as the Turkish foreign
minister replied he did not want to give the impression that
negotiations were taking place behind Denktash's back.
</P>
<P>
Elaborating on the reason why he made such a proposal,
Kasoulides said that over a meeting the two countries could
clarify their intentions on the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
"If Turkey has the wrong impression on the Cypriot
government's intentions, then we could clarify them and visa
versa." he added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey
militarily intervened and took over the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots, supported by Turkey, declared in 1983
a breakaway "the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus", which was
not recognized by the international community except Turkey.

<HEADLINE> US GDP Grows at 3.1 Pct Annual Rate in Third Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy grew at a
robust 3.1 percent annual rate during the third quarter, the
Commerce Department reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The department said the growth in the gross domestic product
(GDP), the total output of goods and services in this country, was
little dip from the April-June 3.3 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
Despite its continued growth, the economy so far has not
increased price pressures. In fact, a measure tied to the GDP rose
just 1.4 percent at an annual rate, the smallest increase in five
years.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to some economists' earlier predictions, the U.S.
economy continued the speed at nearly the same rate of the
April-June quarter, although that was down from an even stronger
4.9 percent in the January-March period, the department said in
its final revision of third-quarter data.
</P>
<P>
However, many analysts expect the financial chaos in east Asia
to curb economic growth during 1998 and also help the U.S. Federal
Reserve maintain the short-term interest rates steady to prevent
inflation. They are forecasting a growth rate of between 2 percent
and 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The department said the revision to the third-quarter GDP, from
an estimated 3.3 percent a month ago, reflected small downward
changes in most major components.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending increased at a 5.6 percent annual rate, a
small drop from the 5.8 percent earlier estimate. It had slipped
to a 0.9 percent gain in the second quarter after jumping 5.3
percent in the first.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending, which represents two-thirds of the nation's
economic activity, is believed to have slowed in the
October-December quarter, although some experts believe it
remained strong due to solid job and income growth.
</P>
<P>
Business spending on equipment such as computers and
communications gear was unchanged at a 24.1 percent annual growth,
a little pickup from 23 percent in the second quarter and the best
since the final three months of 1983.
</P>
<P>
Residential construction rose at a 2.7 percent rate, down from
the 3.7 percent estimate last month and 7.4 percent from the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
Increases in business inventories slowed to 47.5 billion U.S.
dollars in the third quarter from 77.6 billion dollars in the
second. And exports of goods and services grew at just a 4.4
percent rate as against 18.4 percent from April through June.
</P>
<P>
The various changes put the economy's output in the third
quarter at a seasonally and inflation-adjusted annual rate of 7.21
trillion dollars, according to the department report.

<HEADLINE> Round-Up: Moi Tips to Win Re-Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 23 (Xinhua) -- With six days to go for the
December 29 General Election, Kenyan people, media and foreign
observers predict that the incumbent President Daniel arap Moi
will be re-elected as president for his last term in office.
</P>
<P>
Moi will lead the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU)
to win another parliamentary majority in the Eighth Parliament,
they estimate.
</P>
<P>
The question in the minds of Moi's campaigners is not whether
they will win the presidential, parliamentary and civic elections
on the polling day but how big the win will be.
</P>
<P>
An article of the weekly East African entitled "Moi and KANU
Look Set for a New Victory" said that in terms of organization
alone, Moi "enjoys the advantage of incumbency and the logistical
apparatus of state that this puts at his disposal, not to mention
a nationwide party structure built unchallenged over the last
three decades."
</P>
<P>
The article noted that the ruling party had sufficient
campaign funds and quoted reliable estimates as putting it in the
region of 158 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
"No other political party, or even all of them combined, could
command this amount of support," added the article which was
carried last month by the weekly.
</P>
<P>
Though opposition parties criticize Moi for mismanagement,
corruption and deteriorating living standards in the past five
years, Moi can take an advantage of the divisions among the
Opposition.
</P>
<P>
There have been periodic attempts to forge some sort of
anti-KANU stance but they have been more rhetorical than
substantive, the article stressed.
</P>
<P>
This time round, the Opposition is even more splintered than
in the first multi-party election in 1992, the article said,
adding that this year the Opposition fielded 14 presidential
candidates, compared with seven in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Most foreign observers and many local independent analysts
also predict that Moi and his ruling KANU are favorites to win
the presidency and a parliamentary majority.
</P>
<P>
However, Moi, in power since 1978, has a fight to win on the
first ballot and avoid an unprecedented second round run-off
against an opposition upstart.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties recognizes that a single opposition
presidential candidate offers them the best chance in the
presidential race. But they have no mechanisms to choose such a
candidate.
</P>
<P>
So, the Opposition has settled on their second best strategy
to lock President Moi out of at least four provinces of Kenya's
eight provinces, thereby forcing a run-off.
</P>
<P>
Under Kenya's Constitution, the president-elect must collect
at least 25 percent of the vote in at least five of Kenya's eight
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Moi, 73, who is seeking a final five-year term for presidency,
managed to get more than 25 percent of the votes cast during the
last General Election in Rift Valley, Western, Coast, Eastern and
Northeastern provinces.
</P>
<P>
According to the Opposition's strategy this time round,
presidential candidate Michael Wamalwa of opposition Ford-Kenya
will lock Moi out in Western Province while presidential
candidates Mwai Kibaki and Charity Ngilu will lock him out in
Central and Eastern provinces respectively. And so on to the
run-off.
</P>
<P>
Considering that Moi had 39 percent of the vote in Western
province in 1992, local analysts said, it looks unlikely for
Wamalwa to whip up a more than 14 percent anti-Moi swing.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the decisive battle-front is likely to be East
province where Ngilu, Presidential candidate for the opposition
Social Democratic Party, has strong backing from her Kamba
people.
</P>
<P>
Ngilu, Kenya's first female candidate for the presidency,
could stop President Moi from getting the 25 percent of the vote
in Eastern Province which Moi secured in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Another article under the title of "The Opposition Blew a
Golden Chance" pointed out that to win this election, Opposition
leaders would need to be more clear-minded than they have been.
</P>
<P>
To win this election, it said, they need to make sacrifices
but they probably are not ready to, adding that many of them
would have to forgo their personal ambitions for the time being.
</P>
<P>
Wachira Maina, author of the article and constitutional
lawyer, put it right when he said, "since they are not ready to
do any of these things, I have no doubt they have already lost
the election."

Tsohatzopoulos said today.
</P>
<P>
Tsohatzopoulos made the statement in the northern Greek city of

<HEADLINE> UN Launches Socio-Economic Surveys in Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) today officially launched
the comprehensive socio-economic surveys in rural areas of
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, chief of ECA's food
security and sustainable development division P.
Makinwa-Adebusoye said the socio-economic surveys were conducted
in seven regions in Ethiopia, namely Afar, Amhara,
Benshangul-Gumuz, Gambells, Shouther Region, Tigray and Somalia
with over 1,000 questions.
</P>
<P>
According to the division chief, the survey results have been
produced in very comprehensive documents numbering 12 volumes.
</P>
<P>
These documents contain 4,000 statistical tables supported by
500 pages of detailed analysis. A total of 25,000 farmers
responded to the questions that were asked and 1,500 extension
agents and rural development assistants participated in the
surveys.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time that socio-economic surveys of such
magnitude have been conducted in Ethiopia at household levels.
This is also the first time that a comprehensive data system has
been generated for such regions as Gambella, Benshangui-Gumuz,
Somali, Afar and southern regions," she said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to major findings of the socio-economic surveys in
Ethiopia, the ECA division chief said, the average family size of
the rural surveyed households ranges from six to seven.
</P>
<P>
On illiteracy status in the surveyed regions, the division
chief said that a large proportion of the population in the
sample areas were reported to be illiterate, i.e. in Afar 77.8
percent, Amhara 69.5 percent, Tigray 69.1 percent,
Benshangul-Gumuz 64.8 percent, Gambella 64.2 percent and southern
region 59.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The survey result also revealed the fact that in all the
survey areas, female illiteracy rates were higher than that of
males," she added.
</P>
<P>
According to the ECA division chief, in all the surveyed
areas, except in Afar, over 90 percent of the farmers have their
own farmland.
</P>
<P>
However, the survey results revealed that the major problem
for the population in the rural areas are small size of farmland
and fragmentation.
</P>
<P>
The problem of small farm sizes in the arid and semi-arid
areas of Ethiopia is a major problem for any agricultural
transformation process.
</P>
<P>
Most of the farmers in the surveyed regions believe that they
do not possess enough farmland to sustain the given families.
</P>
<P>
She said, the survey results indicate that an overwhelming
majority of the housing units have one or two rooms, adding that
given the average family size which is between six and seven, it
is very clear that most of the dwelling units are overcrowded.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Inter-Party Dialogue "not Window </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The proposed inter-party
dialogue is not propaganda strategy designed as window dressing
to impress donors but rather is for the enhancement of democracy
in the country, a senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Co-chairman of the inter-party dialogue, ruling party national
secretary, Micheal Sata made the remarks at a news briefing after
meeting with co-chairman Mainza Chona of the United National
Independence Party led by former President Kenneth Kaunda and
secretary of the talks Guy Scott of the Lima Party.
</P>
<P>
He condemned Liberal Progressive Front President Roger
Chongwe's statement that President Frederick Chiluba has made a
secret pact with some opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Sata, who doubles as Minister without Portfolio, said that
Chongwe, who has been away from the country since the October 28
coup attempt, is not interested in helping to settle the destiny
of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Sata also accused UNIP leader Kaunda of insulting Chiluba by
calling him unpredictable, adding that he took strong exception
to anyone insulting his president.
</P>
<P>
Co-chairman Chona refuted Sata's accusation, saying that
calling a party unpredictable is not an insult and cautioned Sata
not to stray from the issue at hand which is the preparatory
meeting to the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Chona said the three are happy with the progress toward the
talks to be attended by party presidents next month to discuss
the contentious issues facing the country.
</P>
<P>
At the preliminary meeting held early this month, 31 parties
drew an agenda for the inter-party dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The party presidents will follow the agenda, which includes
most contentious issues like constitution, electoral process and
voters' register and fresh registration.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 23 (Xinhua) -- A woman died this
afternoon following an accident involving South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki's media spokesman Thami Ntenteni, who was
arrested on charges of drunken and negligent driving Monday.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association quoted police as saying that
the other three victims were all in a critical condition.
</P>
<P>
Ntenteni has been released with a written warning to appear in
the Wynberg Magistrate's Court on January 5.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested after an accident in Midrand, a town between
Johannesburg and Pretoria, at about 9 p.m. Monday, in which four
people were seriously injured when the car they were traveling in
caught fire after being hit from behind by another car.
</P>
<P>
Their car left the road and overturned. By the time emergency
personnel arrived at the scene, the victims were still trapped in
the car, a large part of which had burnt out, police said.
</P>
<P>
"This matter is being dealt with by the South African Police
Service and is subject to their normal investigative procedure as
in instances where an alleged crime is suspected," Mbeki's
another spokesman Ricky Naidoo said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican City Alert Over Cholera </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maputo, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique's second largest
city Beira has been put on alert over the danger of a cholera
outbreak, which has taken a toll of 253 since August in other
parts of the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
A media report said today that the port city in central
Mozambique has since Saturday launched a massive clean-up
campaign.
</P>
<P>
About 800 people were mobilized on the first day, the report
said, adding that several hundreds others have volunteered to
work as cleaners in exchange for food.
</P>
<P>
While removing rubbishes in streets, the government has also
closed all the food boothes at the Tchungamoio market, as they
are the most likely channel of disease spreading.
</P>
<P>
The report said authorities are to recruit about 400 people
who will engage in a house-to-house health education program.
Water additives capable of killing cholera virus are also to be
distributed to citizens.
</P>
<P>
Cholera broke out in Mozambique's capital Maputo and Maputo
Province in the south in August and has since spread to
neighboring Gaza, Inhambane and Manica provinces. A total of
8,228 patients have been reported so far.
</P>
<P>
Averttino Barreto, a senior national health official who
recently visited Beira said many places in the city are in the
danger of cholera invasion.

<HEADLINE> China Reiterates Support to Land-for-Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA (PALESTINE), December 23 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese
Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen reiterated here
today that the Chinese government supports land-for-peace
principle in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Qian made the statement when he met with Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat in his office in Gaza
city.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese minister said, "China supports the Middle East
peace process and it is very much concerned about the
impasse of the peace march."
</P>
<P>
He said, "the main reason for the stalemate is that the current
Israeli government has not honored its previous government's
commitment to the land-for-peace principle agreed by all sides
concerned at the Madrid peace conference." Therefore, he urged
the Israeli government to abide by U.N. resolutions and the
land-for-peace principle so as to push the peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
He said, "China appreciates the stance taken by the PNA in
resolving the Palestinian-Israeli dispute through peaceful
negotiations. And China will continue to support the PNA to
promote peace in a flexible and pragmatic way."
</P>
<P>
Arafat briefed Qian Qichen on the latest developments in the
Middle East and expressed hope that China would play a greater
role in getting the peace process moving.
</P>
<P>
He said that the impasse of the process would create more
problems for the whole region, citing economic difficultities of
the Palestinian self-rule area as a result of the blockade by
Israeli authorities.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Arafat expressed his thanks to the
Chinese government and people who, according to him, have
rendered cordial aid and support to the Palestinians in time
of needs.
</P>
<P>
Qian also briefed Arafat on his visits to Lebanon and
Syria and also his talks with Israeli leaders prior to his
visit to Gaza. He said, "China supports the just cause of
the Palestinians and believes that they should have their own
state."
</P>
<P>
Qian also met and had talks with PNA Minister of Planning
and International Cooperation Nabil Shaath. The two sides signed
three documents of cooperation under which China will provide a
loan and help the PNA to build a road in the self-rule
area.
</P>
<P>
Gaza is the fourth leg of Qian's Middle East tour which
has taken him to Lebanon, Syria and Israel. He will also
visit Egypt.

CAIRO, December 23 (Xinhua) -- EgyptAir was hoaxed today by a
second bomb warning in less than 10 days, the Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Thirty minutes after an EgyptAir's flight took off for Japanese
capital Tokyo, Cairo airport was warned by an anonymous call that
a bomb had been planted on the plane.
</P>
<P>
EgyptAir, however, decided not to order back the plane which
was carrying 180 passengers plus a crew of 23.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Egyptian Embassy in Japan was hoaxed by an
anonymous caller that an EgyptAir jet flying from Tokyo to Cairo
had a bomb on board.
</P>
<P>
No bomb was found, but the flight was delayed for four hours.
</P>
<P>
Flights between Tokyo and Cairo have been shelved for some time
due to massive cancellations of trips to Egypt after Islamic
militants killed 58 foreign tourists in Egypt's southern resort
Luxor on November 17.

Addis Ababa, December 23 (xinhua) -- Of all the medical
fields, psychiatric treatments in Ethiopia remain in negligence
and threatened by lack of professionals, the Ethiopian News
Agency reported today.

The agency quoted Tiruwork Tafesse, Director of the Amanuel

the Ethiopian government has recently set up 28 psychiatric
centers nationwide to ward off the health problems of its

</P>
<P>
Tafesse called for efforts to expand psychiatric profession in
Ethiopia.
</P>

There are over 6,000 mental patients in Ethiopia who should be

<HEADLINE> Turkey Blasts Greek Expulsion of Turkish Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkey accused Greece of
expelling a Turkish diplomat in retaliation for the expulsion of
a Greek diplomat by Turkey Monday, said a Turkish official
statement released today.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry statement said that Greece today asked
Administrative Attache Nedin Ozergin in Turkey's General
Consulate in Thessaloniki, northern city of Greece, to leave the
country.
</P>
<P>
Turkey Monday ordered Greek Administrative Official Efstratios
Haralambous to leave the country within one week due to his
alleged involvement in espionage.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that Greece's act of retaliation against
Turkey's expulsion of the Greek diplomat was "baseless."
</P>
<P>
Turkey accused Haralambous, who served in Greek General
Consulate in Turkey's largest city of Istanbul, of spying for
Turkey's outlawed Kurdish Worker's Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been criticizing Greece for allegedly providing
political, financial and military support to the PKK.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government has rejected the Turkish claims, saying
that Ankara has failed to substantiate them.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 13-year-old separatist war against
the Turkish government in eastern and southeastern Turkey for an
independent Kurdish state in the area.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, both members of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization, have long been at odds over several issues
including the limits of air space and the Aegean Sea, rights
to sea-bed minerals and the Cyprus problem.

<HEADLINE> UK's State-Owned BNFL, Magnox Agree to Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Britain's state-owned nuclear
operations -- British Nuclear Fuels Limited and Magnox Electric --
will merge next year.
</P>
<P>
The merger will be supported by a 3.7 billion pound (5.92
billion US dollar) undertaking from the government to cover
clear-up costs, according to an official announcement released
here today.
</P>
<P>
Energy Minister John Battle said the government expected the
merged group "to reduce substantially" the costs of eventually
closing Magnox nuclear reactors and leaning the sites.
</P>
<P>
Integration of BNFL, the fuel reprocessing business, and
Magnox, the nuclear generator, has been planned since Magnox was
separated from the newer nuclear fleet privatized with British
Energy last year.
</P>
<P>
The merger includes a clawback incentive program, which means
both the nuclear business and the government can benefit equally
from cost reductions on the liabilities of up to 1.6 billion
pounds (2.56 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, the merger could result in the loss of about 10
percent of the combined companies' workforce of more than 19,000.

<HEADLINE> Coca-Cola to Acquire French Beverage Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The deal, which has Coca-Cola purchasing all Orangina brands
and four bottling and concentrate plants, is to give the U.S.
company a 58 percent share of the French soda market, according
to newspaper reports here today.
</P>
<P>
Coca-Cola already has a dominant position in France,
commanding a 49.6 percent market share, the Wall Street Journal
reported. Meanwhile, Orangina, a carbonated drink that contains
orange juice and pulp and has been a fierce rival to Coke, is
France's most popular noncola soft drink, with a market share of
about 8.5 percent. Combined, the two would dwarf rivals, such as
Pepsi, which in 1996 had a market share of 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
This competition now extends to a noncola product, according
to analysts. The planned acquisition surprised many industry
executives because of Pernod Ricard's bitter relationship in
recent years with Coca-Cola, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, France's antitrust authority fined Coke
1.8 million U.S. dollars for anticompetitive practices in the
early 1990s, following a complaint from Orangina. In addition,
Pernod Ricard distributes Pepsi products in restaurants and bars
in France.

<HEADLINE> New Scale for Apportioning UN Membership Dues Adopted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The General Assembly of
the United Nations has adopted a new scale of assessments for
1998-2000 that remains a ceiling rate of 25 percent but lowers the
floor rate to 0.001 percent, a release from the spokesman's office
said today.
</P>
<P>
Adopting the resolution without a vote late Monday night, which
sets out exactly what percent each country will pay, the assembly
also decided to consider reviewing the scale for the period of
1999-2000 in the coming months, in the light of "all relevant
factors, including the periodic reports of the secretary-general
on the status of contributions."
</P>
<P>
The release said the 185-member assembly firmly rejected any
change in the United States payments.
</P>
<P>
In responding to the provision, the European Union said it
would agree to open the scale discussions only after the United
States had adopted legally binding provisions to clear its arrears
in full and respect its financial obligations under the Charter of
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Any unilateral reduction of the amounts owed to the
organization by the United States could not be accepted, the

<HEADLINE> Plane Crashes in Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, December 23 (Xinhua) -- A Libyan BA 310 plane crashed
today in northern Libya as it made a forced landing along a
highway, resulting in serious burns and injuries of its five crew
members.
</P>
<P>
According to a Libyan news agency report received here, the
plane was on its way from northern coastal city of Sert to
Tripoli, but had to make forced landing on a highway some 25
kilometers south of the city of Beni Walid. The plane crashed and
went ablaze.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Tripoli airport sources as saying that the
plane encountered technical trouble, attributing this to the
serious shortage of spare parts facing the aviation sector as a
result of the embargo imposed against Libya.
</P>
<P>
Libya is facing an international embargo since 1992 for having
failed to hand over two Libyan citizens suspected of involvement
in the bombing of a U.S. passenger plane over Lockerbie, Scotland,
in 1988, causing the death of 270 people.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Urgently Needs 26,000 Tons of Relief Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Vice-president
Christon Tembo said here today that his country urgently needs
26,000 tons of relief maize to feed people in 29 districts at an
estimated cost of eight million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Addressing donors over the food security situation in the
country at Lulungushi International Conference Center in Lusaka,
Tembo said that about one million people in 29 districts have
lost their crops, seeds, animals due to floods and droughts and
need urgent food relief.
</P>
<P>
He added that about 8.5 million Dollars, inclusive of internal
transportation, handling and storage, will be needed to allocate
the relief food locally to cover the period from December this
year to March 1998.
</P>
<P>
Tembo stated that his office is carrying further assessment of
seven more districts where starvation is looming, adding that the
number of affected districts could rise to 36.
</P>
<P>
There is enough food in the country, but the government has no
money to spend on the relief program, said Tembo. He appealed to
the donor community to render financial support.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that Zambia, with a population of over
nine million, needs to import 270,000 tons of maize to guarantee
the country's food security in the 1997-1998 agricultural season
in preparations against the upcoming El Nino.

<HEADLINE> Cairo Agreement Threatening Peace in Somalia: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- A senior Ethiopia
diplomat today said the agreement reached among Somali rival
faction leaders in Cairo "is a threat to peace in Somalia".
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, the diplomat said "the
agreement which does not include all members of the National
Salvation Council (NSC) marks the 'beginning of a dangerous
situation' in the war-torn Somalia."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Somali problem could be resolved sustainably
provided that an agreement is reached through negotiations in
which all clans are represented, adding that a reconciliation
that excludes particular clans would only foment further
divisions and instability.
</P>
<P>
"The Cairo agreement which excludes a big clan in northern
Somalia could also provoke uneasiness among the Hawiyee and the
non-Hawiyee clans in southern Somalia," the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
He said, the Cairo agreement has not won the approval of all
members of the NSC.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat said, the attempt by Egypt to win publicity by
hijacking the Somali reconciliation process would only worsen the
situation in the war-ravaged state.
</P>
<P>
He said the Cairo agreement has breached the Sodere agreement
which has flickered a glimmer of hope to lasting peace in
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat also said Ethiopia which is directly affected by
the problems in Somalia would endeavor to ensure sustainable
peace there.
</P>
<P>
The existing socio-economic and political relations between
Ethiopia and Somalia makes Ethiopia's role in the latter
irreplaceable by any other party, the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
Two co-chairmen of the NSC of Somalia, Aden Abdullahi Nur and
Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, yesterday issued a press statement here,
condemning the Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement on
Somali reconciliation talks in Cairo and dismissing the statement
as irresponsible and misleading to the international community.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Troops Shell South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli troops bombarded
Lebanese southern provinces throughout Tuesday in retaliation for
a Muslim guerrillas' attack which left three Israeli soldiers
wounded earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese official National News Agency said Israeli troops
shelled a Lebanese army barrack and nearby villages in Nabatiye, a
southern province facing the Israeli-occupied border enclave this
morning, but didn't cause any casualties.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops then extended their shelling, which was
accompanied by heavy gun fires, to another villages in the same
province where the three Israeli soldiers were blown up.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Israeli warplanes hovered low over Nabatiye
and Iqlim Toufaha, another province near the occupation zone,
making mock air raids, the agency added.
</P>
<P>
Early this morning, a guerrilla unit donated a roadside bomb
when an Israeli patrol was traveling on the way from the village
of Rihan to Sujoud, both in the Israeli self-styled security zone,
a guerrilla's statement said.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli officer and two soldiers were wounded in the
explosion and their call for help could be heard nearby, the
statement added.
</P>
<P>
Israeli radio confirmed the explosion and admitted three
soldiers were injured by the attack.
</P>
<P>
The conflicts between Israeli troops and Lebanese guerrillas
have lasted since Israel carved out an estimated
1,200-square-kilometer area in south Lebanon in 1985 to prevent
cross-border attacks in its northern areas.

<HEADLINE> Primakov: China, Priority in Russian Foreign Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Russia's foreign policy in the
outgoing year was oriented to the development of relations with
leading Asian countries, especially with China, Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov said today.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, the minister said that Russia's foreign
policy had a considerable advance in relations with China, a
strong pole in the shaping multi-polar world.
</P>
<P>
Primakov noted the 4,200 kilometer stretch of the
Russian-Chinese border was demarcated in the course of the year
and the two sides for the first time reached agreement on detente
in the border zone and the pullback of armed forces by both sides.
</P>
<P>
"The development of Russia's relations with China is aimed at
strategic cooperation in the 21st century, and the solution of
border problems created a model for the solution of similar
problems in the Asia-Pacific region."
</P>
<P>
Primakov also noted a breakthrough in Russian-Japanese
relations in 1997, saying the two countries had a sober approach
to the problem of bilateral relations and aimed at vigorous and
successful development of their economic ties.
</P>
<P>
On relations with countries of the Commonwealth of Independent
States, the minister called for stepping up the CIS integration,
including at an inter-sectoral level.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Russia-Belorussia relations, Primakov stressed that
the Russian Foreign Ministry set a great value on the
Russia-Belorussia Union in which "the states that have common
historical roots are uniting and cooperating in a larger extent
than previously."
</P>
<P>
He also mentioned the successes in normalization of Russia's
relations with Ukraine, saying it had abolished a whole number of
contradictions in their relations and opened a way to their further
development.
</P>
<P>
As for relations with the Baltic states, Primakov said there
had been a sequence of "positive shifts" on this track. A very
serious talk had started which would help abolish obstacles in the
development of Russia's relations with the Baltic states, he
noted.

JOHANNESBURG, December 23 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki's media spokesman, Thami Ntenteni, may face
charges of culpable homicide following a collision near
Johannesburg on Monday night, South African Press Association
reported today.
</P>
<P>
A woman involved in the accident died this afternoon and three
other victims, one woman and two men, were in a critical
condition, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Ntenteni was arrested for drunken and negligent driving but
then released with a written warning to appear in the Wynberg
Magistrate's Court on January 5.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred in Midrand, a town between Johannesburg
and Pretoria, at about 9 p.m. on Monday, in which four people
were seriously injured when the car they were traveling in caught
fire after being hit from behind by another car.
</P>
<P>
Their car left the road and overturned. By the time emergency
personnel arrived at the scene, the victims were still trapped in
the car, a large part of which had burnt out, police said.
</P>
<P>
"This matter is being dealt with by the South African Police
Service and is subject to their normal investigative procedure,"
Mbeki's spokesman Ricky Naidoo said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Road accidents usually peak at the Christmas season in South
Africa when traffic on national routes are heavy with holiday
makers.
</P>
<P>
So far, 468 people have lost their lives on South African
roads since the beginning of the month, the traffic authorities
said. Most of the accidents were caused by speeding.

WASHINGTON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
authorized U.S. firms to compete for a contract to supply attack
helicopters to Turkey, a State Department spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Following a joint State Department and Pentagon review of
requests by American companies, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright "today decided to allow U.S. participation in this
competition," State Department spokesman James Foley said.
</P>
<P>
"Her decision is fully consistent with our policy concerning
arms transfers to Turkey," Foley said. "We seek to support this
important NATO ally's efforts to meet its legitimate self-defense
requirements, and to fulfill its NATO commitments."
</P>
<P>
The State Department had approved marketing licenses allowing
U.S. companies to export technical information about their attack
helicopters so that they could formulate competitive bids.
</P>
<P>
He said this did not automatically entail a license to export
such helicopters to Turkey, for which a separate decision would be
needed should a U.S. firm win the Turkish competition.

<HEADLINE> World Bodies Join Hands with Nigeria in Drug War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Some world organizations have
jointly decided that the existing facilities within the Nigerian
Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) will be reinforced through
logistic and technical assistance.
</P>
<P>
These world bodies are the United Nations Drug Control Program
(UNDCP), Interpol and World Customs Organization, the Nigerian
Television Authority reported tonight.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, this was announced by the leader of
an international visitation team to Nigeria on drug control, who
is UNDCP's regional officer for west and central Africa, when the
four-man team visited NDLEA Chairman Musa Bamaiyi as part of
their seven-nation mission tour.
</P>
<P>
He said the decision was taken at the recognition of the fact
that there was definite proof of success on the part of Nigeria
in its fight to contain the abuse of drug pills and trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The team chose to visit Nigeria because they were impressed
with NDLEA's integrated approach system of simultaneously
fighting supply and demand reduction, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is certainly the way of the future," he pointed out,
adding that NDLEA was a very viable partner that could not be
ignored in the global effort to combat the drug problem.
</P>
<P>
In his response, Bamaiyi reassured the visitors that Nigeria
as a sovereign entity would continue to address the drug
phenomenon not in an effort to please any other country but to
salvage its society from the devastating scourge.
</P>
<P>
He said the level of achievement so far recorded could be
traced to dedication of the remaining staff of the agency after
flushing out about 1,000 others in its determination to have a
corrupt-free law enforcement agency.

JOHANNESBURG, December 23 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's monthly
trade account swung into deficit in November after surprising the
market in October with an impressive surplus of 1.73 billion Rand
(360 million U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Customs figures released today showed that imports exceeded
exports by 73.7 million Rand (15.3 million Dollars) last month, a
disappointing deficit following a strong pick-up in exports over
the year, the South African Press Association reported.

The cumulative trade surplus declined to 11.37 billion Rand
(2.37 billion Dollars) from 11.45 billion (2.38 billion Dollars)
at the end of October.
</P>
<P>
Exports dropped sharply to 10.9 billion Rand (2.27 billion

October, while imports declined from 11.21 billion Rand (2.34
billion Dollars) to 11 billion (2.29 billion Dollars).

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Jordan today called on Israel to
implement the peace agreements it signed with its Arab neighbors
to revive the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel should step up its efforts to carry out the peace
accords to advance its talks with the Palestinians, Jordan's Prime
Minister Abdul Salam Majali said during a meeting with Yossi
Beilin, Israeli Knesset (parliament) member of the Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
Beilin, a former Labor government minister, arrived here today
for a short visit.
</P>
<P>
Intensive efforts are needed to break the current deadlock in
the peace process and push it forward, Majali said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed hope that the negotiations between Israel
and Syria and Lebanon can restart.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli peace talks were suspended last year after a
series of suicide bombings in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Majali also stressed the importance of economic cooperation
between Jordan, the Palestinians and Israel in achieving peace.
</P>
<P>
Beilin agreed to it, saying that the best solution to the
current crisis is to strengthen economic cooperation among the
three sides.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu's recent
claim that the West Bank is part of Israel, Beilin said that
Israel should not draw a map for the future of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
It is unwise for Israel to do so without the participation of
the Palestinians. Instead, they should work together on this
issue, he said.

UNITED NATIONS, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of
the United Nations today decided to extend the mandate of the
United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) for a
further period of six months until June 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
In its resolution, the Security Council reiterated its grave
concern at the continuing excessive and increasing levels of
military forces and armaments in the Republic of Cyprus and the
rate at which they are being expanded, upgraded and modernized.
</P>
<P>
The Council called upon the leaders of the two communities to
continue the discussions on security issues begun in September 26,
1997.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating that the status quo of the island is unacceptable,
the Council stressed its support for the Secretary-General's
mission of good office and the importance of concerted efforts to
work with the Secretary-General towards an overall comprehensive
settlement.
</P>
<P>
The council urged the leaders of the two communities to commit
themselves to this process of negotiations and to cooperate
actively and constructively with the secretary-General and his
Special Adviser.
</P>
<P>
The Council further called on all parties concerned to create a
climate for reconciliation and genuine mutual confidence on both
sides, and to avoid any actions which might increase tension,
including through further expansion of military forces and
armaments.
</P>
<P>
It reaffirmed its position that a Cyprus settlement must be
based on a State of Cyprus with a single sovereignty and
international personality and a single citizenship, with its
independence and territorial integrity safeguarded, and comprising
two politically equal communities as described in the relevant
Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been virtually partitioned since 1974.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Offers List of Jordanian Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has officially offered
Jordan a list of Jordanian prisoners in Iraq's jails on the
kingdom's request, confirming that all the 66 jailbirds got fair
trial and were being treated well.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi Embassy in Jordan sent the list to the Jordanian
Foreign Ministry Monday after the Jordanian government
officially asked Iraq to provide the information about all the
Jordanians jailed in Iraqi prisons, embassy officials told
Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
The list also contained the names of Jordanian prisoners who
were set free during the last two years on Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein's order.
</P>
<P>
The number of Jordanian prisoners in Iraqi jails are
officially estimated at over 100 but unofficially at over 600.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has just officially declared to suspend the death
sentence on a Jordanian prisoner in an effort to defuse the
tension caused by its execution of five Jordanians this month.
</P>
<P>
The suspension of death sentence came amid reports that
Jordan and Iraq will strengthen their economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Iraq executed four Jordanian prisoners on charge of smuggling
car spare parts on December 8, then planned to free 140 Jordanian
prisoners, but executed another Jordanian on charge of murder on
December 10.
</P>
<P>
Jordan expelled seven Iraqi diplomats in retaliation of the
executions and expressed perplexity with Iraq's contradictory
actions.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Iraq used to be firm allies before and during the
Gulf War in 1991. But after that, the bilateral ties suffered a
setback as Jordan was eager to distance itself away from Iraq to
end international alienation.
</P>
<P>
However, the ties has been picking up in recent years as
Iraq begins to provide the kingdom with more and more oil
at discount prices and keeps increasing the volume of imports
from Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Iraq provided Jordan with oil worth 625 million U.S. dollars
this year, a 7 percent increase over the previous year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Firms Allowed to Bid for Selling Choppers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
authorized U.S. firms to compete for a contract to supply attack
helicopters to Turkey, a State Department spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Following a joint State Department and Pentagon review of
requests by American companies, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright "today decided to allow U.S. participation in this
competition," State Department spokesman James Foley said.
</P>
<P>
"Her decision is fully consistent with our policy concerning
arms transfers to Turkey," Foley said. "We seek to support this
important NATO ally's efforts to meet its legitimate self-defense
requirements, and to fulfill its NATO commitments."
</P>
<P>
The State Department had approved marketing licenses allowing
U.S. companies to export technical information about their attack
helicopters so that they could formulate competitive bids, said
Foley.
</P>
<P>
He said this did not automatically entail a license to export
such helicopters to Turkey, for which a separate decision would be
needed should a U.S. firm win the Turkish competition.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey is a key NATO ally. It is entirely appropriate... for
NATO allies to have sophisticated U.S. military equipment in their
inventories," he added.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, after refused by the European Union (EU) as a future
potential candidate, has warmed up its relations with Washington.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Turkey signed a 2.5 billion U.S. dollars contract
with the United States to buy 47 Boeing aircraft.

<P>
The delegates agreed that a joint operation between the two
countries would be launched to curb drug traffickers, bandits and
illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The meeting decided that Ugandan village executive officers
and local government officials will have a mandate to issue local
travel documents for short distance cross-border trips.

NAGQU, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Heavy snowfalls in the middle of
December have intensified the disaster in snowstorm-hit Nagqu
Prefecture, a major pastoral area in southwest China's Tibet
Autonomous Region, but no deaths of people were reported thanks to
the government's disaster-relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
About 260,000 people and five million heads of livestocks are
suffering from the disaster in 110 townships, where the snowfall
is 40 cm on average. In some heavily-stricken villages, the
snowfall has reached above 50 cm.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the snowfalls came more than 50 days earlier than
the same period last year, and the average minimum temperature for
the prefecture is now 30 degrees Celsius below zero. Some 78,000
head of livestock have already died from the low temperature.
</P>
<P>
The regional government has cleared snows from the blocked
highways and transported disaster-relief goods to the area. A loan
of some 22 million yuan (about 2.65 million US dollars) has also
been provided for purchasing livestock from farmers as a way of
reducing their losses. Besides, telecommunication lines and
equipment damaged by the heavy snowfalls were repaired promptly.

and the Beijing Switchgear Plant.

<P>
"The temporary lay-off of workers and the consequent
difficulties have been caused chiefly by the changes of domestic
and overseas markets as well as by the readjustment of the economic
and industrial structures," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The leading officials at all levels, particularly the high and
middle-ranking officials, must have stronger sense of
responsibility and must work day and night to help solve the
problems of wokers in difficult enterprises and the laid-off
workers," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Any Party and government official who ignores the problems are
completely derelict of their duty," he said.
</P>
<P>
Beijing North Engine Plant, a large enterprise which lost 33.57
million yuan in the early 1990s and is expected to make a profit
of 10 million yuan this year, currently has laid off 300 workers.
</P>
<P>
Beijing February 7 Locomotive Plant, which has a history of 100
years, has encountered difficulties in restructuring and has laid
off 600 workers.
</P>
<P>
"The state-owned enterprises, particularly the large and
medium-sized enterprises, being the backbone, leading force and
pillar of the national economy, have made huge contributions to
the national economic construction and the built-up of the
national defense," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But in the meantime, we must realize that the state-owned
enterprises need to experience a deep process of reform under the
conditions of opening up to the outside world and the socialist
market economy," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Compete in Wrestling Internationals in Tehran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The Southern Oregon University
free-style wrestling team has announced its readiness to compete
in the 16th Fajr international wrestling competitions to be held
here next month.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA said that the U.S. university
squad has confirmed its participation in a letter to the Iranian
Wrestling Federation. However, IRNA did not mention when and how
the letter was received.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, the American squad asked for information about
the number of athletes allowed to participate in the tournament
and other matters concerned.
</P>
<P>
In a competition in Russia earlier this year, the American
wrestling officials, including the head of the U.S. free-style
wrestling team, expressed readiness to sent a team to Tehran, the
report added.
</P>
<P>
It would be the first U.S. sports team to take part in Iran's
annual sports meets to celebrate the anniversary of the Islamic
Revolution in 1979, after which Washington and Iran severed their
diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
Both Iran and the Unitd States took some small and cautious
steps to low down their hostile tones this year, particularly
after the presidential elections in May when the moderate
intellectual Mohammad Khatami was elected Iranian president.

<HEADLINE> Chernobyl Reconstruction to be Put in Tenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) will soon hold tenders for
reconstructing the crumbling shelter encasing Chernobyl's fourth
reactor, the Ukrainian News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But actual repairs will likely come next century as much of the
preliminary research for the project has yet to be done, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen countries have pledged or already paid out a total of
165 million U.S. dollars to finance repairs to the reactor's
11-year-old sarcophagus. EBRD, which administers the Chernobyl
Shelter Fund, has agreed to provide a total of 387.5 million
dollars to the project by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
"This is more than enough to start work on the project," said
Vince Novak, project manager for the EBRD Chernobyl Shelter Fund.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine will contribute 50 million dollars in labor and
construction materials towards the project. The leading Western
industrialized nations will ultimately offer 300 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
It will take almost a decade to repair the protective
sarcophagus hurriedly erected in 1987 to seal the radioactive
core of the No. 4 reactor, which was the source of the world's
worst civil nuclear accident in April 1986 .

<HEADLINE> Humanitarian Aid Stalled by Customs Barriers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Humanitarian aid to Ukraine has
decreased by more than half in 1997 as foreign donors are
frustrated by customs delays and import duties.
</P>
<P>
Aid volumes that had climbed steadily for years peaked at
50,000 tons in 1996. This year, the total is down to just 20,000
tons, said Bronislav Ometsynsky, deputy head of the Ukrainian
government's Humanitarian Aid Commission.
</P>
<P>
"Of course aid is shrinking if it cannot get into the country,"
said Onno Elderenbosch, counselor at the embassy of the
Netherlands, the third-largest donor of humanitarian aid to
Ukraine after the United States and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Ometsynsky acknowledged that complicated customs clearance
procedures and constant changes in tax rules have deprived Ukraine
of badly needed clothing, food and medicine. There have been at
least six changes in the government's policy on exempting
humanitarian aid from taxes and import duties since 1996.
</P>
<P>
First, a cabinet decree exempting humanitarian aid from taxes
was canceled in November 1996. Then the tax exemptions were
restored in February, but only for aid donors approved in advance
by the Humanitarian Aid Commission.
</P>
<P>
Second, a duty on imported foodstuffs imposed on October 7
subjected humanitarian food shipments to tariffs averaging 30
percent. On October 31, aid donors were subjected to a 20 percent
value-added tax on their shipments.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, all this damaged our country's image and cost us
30,000 tons of humanitarian aid," said Ometsynsky.
</P>
<P>
Besides, customs delays have also drawn loud complaints from
aid donors. Elderenbosch said that many private donor
organizations in the Netherlands have simply bypassed Ukraine
after encountering problems here.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the U.S. government has reduced humanitarian
assistance. This year, it sent supplies worth 35 million dollars,
down from 50 million dollars last year and 80 million dollars in
1995, Ometsynsky added.

<P>
HARARE, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe today swore in nine members of an independent review
commission on health to look into the country's ailing health
sector.
</P>
<P>
The commission, which includes a panel of five doctors, will
be chaired by a Tanzanian national, Eleuthera Tarimo, who is
currently working with the World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
Tarimo retires from the WHO at the end of this month to take
up the chairmanship of the commission full time.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the swearing-in ceremony, Health
and Child Welfare Minister Timothy Stamps said the commission,
set up against the background of decreased funding to the health
sector, will also be tasked to look into the impact of chronic
diseases such as diabetes, HIV/AIDS, heart diseases, tuberculosis
and new strains of cancer.
</P>
<P>
''The commission will generally look at the health system in
overall and how effective it is in discharging its duties and
providing health services and to see where we can improve,'' the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
The commission is expected to report back to the president at
the end of March next year.

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- A band of gunmen charged into a mountain hamlet in Mexico,
spraying rifle fire and swinging machetes, killing 45 Indian
refugees, Red Cross officials said. It was the bloodest violence
in the southern state of Chiapas since Indian rebels launched an
uprising there nearly four years ago.
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu led members of his
Cabinet on a helicopter tour of the West Bank, apparently to
dramatize their commitment to Israeli security while they wrestle
with American demands for a "credible" withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- Terry L. Nichols, a father of three who led a seemingly
prosaic midwestern life for four decades, was today convicted on
one count of conspiracy and eight counts of involuntary
manslaughter in the massive truck bombing of the Oklahoma City
federal building, the nation's most notorious and deadliest act of
domestic terrorism, which killed 168 people.
</P>
<P>
-- The United States largest Internet access provider is about
to announce plans to build a huge headquarters in Loudoun County
that will employ more than 3,000 people and become the control
center for much of the world's online traffic, company executives
and Virginia officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. is considering lending South Korea some of the 5
billion U.S. dollars it promised to make available only as part of
a "second line of defense," while some big U.S. banks said they
may roll over their loans to Korean customers. The talks come amid
worries that Korean firms might not be able to repay or roll over
15 billion dollars in loans at the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. Treasury Department is moving to close an
increasingly popular loophole in foreign-tax-credit rules that
officials believe is being used by American multinational
corporations to avoid paying billions of dollars in U.S. taxes.

<HEADLINE> Environmental Experts Call for Fewer Greeting Cards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese environmentalists have
called on their countrymen to mail fewer greeting cards to save
forests and reduce pollution.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made just ahead of the peak New Year season when
Chinese people mail hundreds of millions of cards to convey
festive greetings.
</P>
<P>
"Few people know that producing 4,000 cards may consume one
tree, or more than 250,000 trees will be felled if about one
billion cards are made around the world annually," said Zhang
Mingxu of the Shanghai Municipal Research Institute of
Environmental Science.
</P>
<P>
The production of greeting card paper also threatens the
environment when paper-making enterprises, especially small mills
lacking disposal facilities, discharge untreated wastewater into
rivers, Zhang was quoted in the "Yangcheng Evening News."
</P>
<P>
China's task is particularly tough because of little awareness
of environmental protection in some enterprises, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
One place where awareness may be growing is Shanghai, China's
most fashionable metropolis, where the sales of greeting cards
were reportedly down this winter compared with previous years.
</P>
<P>
"Recently, delivery amount of the cards isn't as high as the
same periods of the previous two years," Shen Rongchang, an
official with the Shanghai Post Office, told "Jiefang Daily."
</P>
<P>
Salespersons at a department store also said the card business
is not as brisk as in past years, even though there are more than
100 varieties available.

confidence and trust, Wasim said.
</P>
<P>
The special relations are based on historical affinities as
well as bonds of religion and culture, he added.
</P>
<P>
Osama, who is leading a delegation at a meeting of the
Pakistani-Saudi Joint Ministerial Commission, said that Saudi
Arabia and Pakistan should further strengthen bilateral trade and
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the Pakistani-Saudi Investment Company should
be encouraged to play a more positive role in promoting economic
relations between the two countries.

ADDIS ABABA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The Federal High Court is
carrying out the trials of 14 individuals charged with killing of
civilians and damaging properties in various parts of the
country, Ethiopia's Public Prosecutor Office said here today.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian News Agency said the alleged individuals are members

the killings and injurings of civilians, properties damages with
bombings and gun fires in their bid to distort the existing
peaceful situation in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The charges say 11 of the defendants who entered Ethiopia
illegally from Somalia along with accomplices still at large are
responsible for the bombings at Ghion Hotel and Wabe Shebelle
Hotel in Addis Ababa, and Ras Hotel in Dire Dawa, second largest
city in Ethiopia, in which several civilians lost their lives.
</P>
<P>
They are also the ones who planted an explosive in a passenger
bus on its way to Mekele, capital city of northern Tigray region,
in early July two years ago and caused the dreaded deaths of the
travelers including four children, the charges by the prosecutor
office unveil.
</P>
<P>
Among the crimes the defendants committed at various times is
the assassination attempt on Abdulmejid Hussien, Ethiopia's

MACAO, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Macao's exports to Canada in the
first eight months of this year reached 36.83 million Canadian
dollars (25.68 million U.S. dollars), up 28.6 percent over the
same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Canadian exports to Macao in the January-August period hit 2.61
million Canadian dollars (about 1.82 million dollars), up 159.9
percent over the same period of last year, Wednesday's Macao Daily

It added that Canada's imports from Macao only accounted for a
tiny 0.02 percent of all its imports. Most of the imports from

parts, canned food, plastic products and gloves.
</P>
<P>
Canada's exports to Macao included telecommunications

BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The draft of a law on blood
donation was submitted today to the 29th session of the Standing

opened here.
</P>
<P>
The draft has been deliberated twice at previous NPC Standing

</P>
<P>
After the deliberations, the Bureau of Legislative Affairs

of both donors and recipients.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the draft to China's top legislative body, Chen

voluntary blood-donation mechanism should be established to ensure
blood quality.
</P>
<P>
"Blood donation embodies mutual assistance and unselfish
dedication. Neither blood donors nor donation organizers should be
motivated by money," Chen said, adding that "the Chinese
government has been opposing blood sales."
</P>
<P>
When the significance and physiological knowledge on donations
are publicized and sales are checked, Chen said, the demand for
clinical blood can be met and pollution avoided.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft, the state advocates voluntary blood
donations by healthy citizens between 18 and 55, who in turn will
be given certificates issued by health departments and will obtain
a subsidy from employers.
</P>
<P>
The proposed law would prohibit centers from collecting blood
from the same donor too frequently. Those blood center workers who
violate collection regulations would be severely punished.

Addressing a national symposium for directors of provincial

He said that the co-ops should help build up agricultural
production centers in larger scales and with high technology,
organize farmers to form professional co-ops and develop pilot
enterprises by combining processing with sales promotion so as to
benefit themselves.

<HEADLINE> China To Speed Up Housing Reform in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, December 24 (Xinhua) -- China will step up efforts in
1998 to change the present system of housing distribution as a
welfare to the people, according to an ongoing national conference
on economic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
What needs to be solved now in reforming the housing system is
to persuade urban residents to be willing to buy housing and
enable those low- and middle-income families to be able to afford
their housing.
</P>
<P>
Official sources say that measures to speed up the housing
reform include:
</P>
<P>
-- The housing investment by the state, businesses and
government institutions will be gradually incorporated into the
wages of the workers and government functionaries, turning the
housing fund into allowances for them to buy their own housing;
</P>
<P>
-- The rise of housing rent will be speeded up in line with the
percentage the housing rent accounts in the wages of the husband
and wife, thus accelerating the transition from housing rent to
housing cost rent;
</P>
<P>
-- Housing will be gradually sold at cost prices;
</P>
<P>
-- The system of the housing public accumulation funds will
continue and the credit loans for housing purchasers will be
encouraged;
</P>
<P>
-- Housing mortgage loans for individuals will be increased; and
</P>
<P>
-- Efforts will be made to promote the marketing of the housing
with total property right.
</P>
<P>
At present, majority of the urban houses in China are built by
the state, businesses or government institutions and then are
distributed to the workers and government officials and employees
according to their standing or seniority.
</P>
<P>
China will decide in a given period of time to allow no
businesses or government institutions to build housing for their
workers and employees. The existing houses will be gradually sold
to the enterprise workers and government officials and employees.

<HEADLINE> Iran Welcomes Rabbani's Pakistani Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran regards Pakistan's
inviting ousted Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani to visit
Islamabad as a positive step towards reducing tensions in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Iran's representative on Afghan affairs
Alaeddin Boroujerdi. "I hope the trip will create an understanding
between Taliban and the Rabbani government," Iran's official news
agency IRNA quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Rabbani held meetings today in Islamabad
with Pakistani leaders with the aim to end the civil war in
Afghanistan. He paid the visit to Pakistan at the invitation of
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Islamabad has been supporting Taliban, the religious students'
army which took over capital Kabul and drove out the Rabbani
government more than a year ago. Taliban is accused by Iran for
refusing to join the country's peace process.
</P>
<P>
Reaffirming support to the Rabbani government, Iran has tried
to bring the warring factions together on a negotiating table by
hosting an Afghan conference early this month.
</P>
<P>
Boroujerdi said that the discussions between Rabbani and Sharif
on the sidelines of the eighth Islamic summit, held in Tehran on
December 9-11, is the beginning of a new policy of Pakistan
towards Rabbani's government.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Pakistan will use its influence on
the Taliban militia to stop the bloodshed in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran will soon send humanitarian assistance to the
deprived Afghan people, hoping other countries will also provide
relief aid to them, especially those in the central parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Those people are facing threats of lack of food after the
Taliban militia completed a siege to block the U.N. relief
assistance from reaching the region.

SHANGHAI, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Museum of
Natural History today bought an insurance policy worth more
than 20 million yuan (2.4 million US dollars) for the most
precious pieces among its collection.
</P>
<P>
The museum is the first to have its collection insured among

stock company set up three years ago.
</P>
<P>
Dazhong also offered the museum insurance for property and
public responsibility today.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1956, the Shanghai Museum of Natural History is
one of the largest of its kind in China. It has collected 240,000
pieces of samples, in which 184 are of high academic value, and
more than 9,000 books and periodicals.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan to Expand Grain Export to Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan will expand grain
export to Asian countries while maintaining its market share in
the traditional destinations, said Kazakh President Nazarbayev in
Akmola on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan's traditional grain markets have been the members of
the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), said Nazarbayev at a
national agricultural meeting, but it will now try to explore
grain market in Turkey, Pakistan and China.
</P>
<P>
The country's domestic grain market has been sluggish and grain
prices are often lower than production costs due to the gross
inefficiency of the agro-industrial complexes.
</P>
<P>
This situation will adversely affect the country's grain
production and the overall agricultural development in the future.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problems, the Kazakh government has decided to
strengthen the management of agricultural credit, break the
monopoly on grain storage and transport, create a national grain
union to protect the interests of grain producers, improve the
supply system to enable farmers a direct access to farming
supplies, and attract foreign investment and technologies.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan produced 13 million tons of grain this year, which
can not only meet the domestic demand but also have a considerable
surplus for export.

<HEADLINE> Icelandic Aid Plane to Arrive Baghdad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 24 (Xinhua) -- A special Icelandic plane
carrying gifts and medicines to Iraq will arrive in Baghdad
Thursday morning on the occasion of Christmas Day, Iraqi News
Agency (INA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
These gifts are from the "Peace 2000 Institute," an Icelandic
humanitarian organization based in Reykjavik, capital of Iceland,
according to the INA.
</P>
<P>
This direct flight is an expression of the solidarity of the
people of Iceland, as well as people who love justice, peace and
stability all over the world, with the people of Iraq, said INA,
adding that this is a reflection of their rejection of the
seven-year-old U.N. embargo on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Icelandic plane will also carry a delegation representing
the Icelandic humanitarian organization, a female reporter from
Channel 2 of Iceland TV and three members of the "Airlift to
Baghdad" organization of Italy, in addition to a photographer from
the same organization.
</P>
<P>
Another aid plane, chartered by Russia's Liberal Democratic
Party to carry medicines for Iraqi children had been stopped by
Iran.
</P>
<P>
Scheduled to land in Iraq today, the plane was prevented to
enter Iraq through Iran and is currently held up with a delegation
of 20 people at Iran's western city of Kermanshah near the Iraqi
border.
</P>
<P>
The humanitarian aid carried by the plane will be transported
to Iraq by road as Iran thinks that "sending the cargo through air
would only be possible through special U.N. authorization."

<P>
HONG KONG, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Department of
Health (DH) announced Wednesday three more new Influenza A H5N1
cases, which brings the total number of cases to nine confirmed
and six suspected.
</P>
<P>
And, with the death confirmed by the DH Wednesday of a
60-year-old woman who was suspected of contracting the H5N1 virus,
the death toll caused by the avian flu has increased to four.
</P>
<P>
The virus is believed to be transmitted through contact with
chickens or their feces.
</P>
<P>
The new suspected cases involve a 19-year-old girl who is in
critical condition, a three-year-old boy and a three-year-old girl
who are at present under treatment and in satisfactory condition,
the DH said in its daily update on the influenza Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Filmmakers Consider Challenges From Hollywood (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- China's film market, like that
of other developing countries, is facing great challenges from
Hollywood. "How to produce attractive domestic movies" was a topic
of general concern at the recently closed Sixth Golden Rooster and
Hundred Flowers Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
Each year China imports about 10 foreign films, mostly
Hollywood movies. Experts predicted that as China continues
efforts to join the World Trade Organization (WTO), more overseas
films will be screened here. If that happens, the Chinese film
industry could come across more serious difficulties.
</P>
<P>
"Exciting stories, beautifully packaged and successful use of
hi-tech make American films interesting and attractive," say both
viewers and filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
Lu Zhuguo, a famous playwright, agreed that China should learn
from Hollywood and double its efforts to make more attractive
movies.
</P>
<P>
"However, it doesn't mean China may blindly imitate others,"
said Lu, who stressed that Chinese movies should tell about the
lives and stories of its own, because nations have different
cultural traditions, aesthetic conceptions and social values.
</P>
<P>
Chinese artworks, including films, give more attention to
social effects than economic results.
</P>
<P>
Most filmmakers in China had a common understanding that the
rejuvenation of the Chinese film industry should rely on their own
efforts, and that reforms should be deepened in screenplays,
collecting money, marketing operations and personnel training.
</P>
<P>
Yu Min, who wrote New China's first film, called on his
counterparts to closely watch reality and ordinary people's
happiness, sadness or anger, as well as issues of common concern.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Hiding Info From Ministers: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu is keeping his cabinet members in the dark
while creating false impressions about the negotiating process
with the Palestinians, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post quoted a senior Israeli government source as
saying that Netanyahu is concealing "the picture being drawn for
him" by the Americans from his ministers.
</P>
<P>
In other words, the source said, Netanyahu allegedly knows
exactly which and how much territories the United States wants
Israel to hand over to the Palestinians in the second phase of
Israeli troops redeployment, but is withholding this information.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the source made the remarks just after
Netanyahu and most of his cabinet ministers Tuesday completed a
helicopter tour of the West Bank areas that may be included in the
next pullback.
</P>
<P>
The source also assailed Netanyahu for hiding the fact that
pressure is being brought by the U.S. simply because he does not
want his ministers to break ranks before the national budget of
1998 is put to a vote in the Knesset (parliament) at the end of
this month.
</P>
<P>
"But he is wrong about that," the source went on, adding
"because after the budget is approved everything will blow up."
</P>
<P>
He noted that because of the concealment of the truth, some
hard-liners in the cabinet still delude themselves to believe that
a withdrawal from only 6 percent of the West Bank will suffice.
</P>
<P>
The source stressed that Netanyahu's handling of the second
phase troops pullback in the West Bank is causing profound
dissension in the highest levels of his cabinet, while at the same
time creating a potentially irreparable rift between him and his
closest political allies.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister David Levy, one of the cabinet's most
outspoken moderates, did not join the West Bank trip. Levy accused
his cabinet colleagues of thinking that they can procrastinate
endlessly handing over territories to the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Draft of High-Tech Development Zone Law Submitted for Examination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The draft of state high-tech
development zones law was submitted for the first time to China's
top legislative body for examination today.
</P>
<P>
Li Xu'e, vice-chairman of the Education, Science, Culture and
Public Health Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC),
explained the proposed law at the 29th meeting of the Standing
Committee of the Eighth NPC which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Li said the aim of drafting the law is to put into effect the
strategy of vitalizing the nation through science and education,
to promote and standardize the construction of state high-tech
development zones and to develop high-tech industries. This would
help China to promote scientific and technological progress,
economic construction and social development.
</P>
<P>
Cities including Beijing, Shenzhen and Wuhan started building
high-tech development zones in the mid-1980s. During the 1991-1992
period, the State Council approved 52 state high-tech development
zones.
</P>
<P>
Statistics for the 1991-1996 period show that the annual
industrial output value of these development zones has increased
at an average rate of 90 percent. In 1996 these zones' total
industrial output value reached 210 billion yuan (25.3 billion
U.S. dollars), their pre-tax profits, 24 billion yuan (2.89
billion U.S. dollars) and their earnings from exports, 3.8
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are more than 900 kinds of high-tech
development zones worldwide, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said the tasks for state high-tech development zones are to
promote the transfer of Chinese high-tech achievements into
commodities and the industrialization of high-tech findings, based
on China's scientific and technological strength and industrial
basis.
</P>
<P>
Li stressed that enterprises in these development zones must
possess as many intellectual property rights of their own nation
as they can, and make new progress based on imported advanced
technologies.
</P>
<P>
The draft consists of seven chapters in 33 articles.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft, the State Council is responsible for
the macro-control over all the country's development zones, and
governments at lower levels are responsible for the construction
and development of those zones within their own administrative
regions.
</P>
<P>
It also has detailed stipulations on the qualification
recognition of high-tech enterprises in development zones, and the
state's preferential policies on developing high-tech industries.

China's film industry also is facing a money shortage. "Days
Without Hero," at four million yuan, has been called a model for
making movies. When it premiered in Beijing at the end of
February, the movie won high public acclaim and the total box
office reached 30 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The idea that "films are not only artworks but also goods" is
being well-received in the world market. Chinese filmmakers also

junction point between filmmakers and audiences by providing rich
information on market trends and viewers' demands."
</P>
<P>
Actors who lack responsibility also restrict the improvement of
Chinese films. At a recently held seminar, director Wei Lian
criticized some film stars for acting in several plays at the same
time and ignoring the quality of their work.

<HEADLINE> Christmas Becomes Sales Season in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese businessmen have
learned to capitalize on Christmas celebrations to boost their
sales.
</P>
<P>
Large department stores, restaurants and star hotels in the
Chinese capital have brightened their appearance with Christmas
decorations. Banners bearing "Sale" signs on the doorway are
flapping in the winter chill to beckon potential customers.
</P>
<P>
Inside, there are sections for holiday goods such as Christmas
trees and ornaments, greeting cards and specialized gifts.
</P>
<P>
A saleswoman at "Jialefu," a supermarket in the downtown
Chaoyang District, said that each day they can sell out seven to
eight Christmas trees priced between 100 to 300 yuan (about 12 to
35 U.S. dollars). Other Christmas items are also selling well,
she said.
</P>
<P>
"Our customers are mostly Chinese," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Palace Hotel in the downtown Wangfujing area is promoting
its Christmas dinner -- with gift-giving, of course. The highest
price is 560 yuan per person. Other luxurious hotels either are
attracting customers with what they call "revelry parties" or with
art performances and lottery games.
</P>
<P>
However, most foreigners in Beijing are heading
home. U.S.-based Northwest Airlines is reportedly ferrying more
than 300 people back to the United States every day, though among
them are some Chinese seeking to spend an exotic Christmas holiday.
</P>
<P>
For the 40,000-odd Roman Catholics and about 15,000 Christians,
the most important thing is to attend church services. Bishop Fu
Tieshan is going to preside over a midnight Mass at Xuanwumen
Christian church, the oldest in Beijing. He will offer Christmas
greetings and pray for world peace.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has 17 Christian and eight Catholic churches.
</P>
<P>
Not all Beijing residents are ready to embrace the foreign
holiday. "We have enough festivals and holidays of our own. Why go
after the trend?" asked one middle-aged Beijinger.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Military on Alert for Christmas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, December 24 (Xinhua) -- All government military
forces have been put on "red alert" for any attempt to
destabilize the peace and security of the nation over the
Christmas period, a senior official said today.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone's army chief of staff, Colonel Sam Williams said
that "we have monitored reports of a pending attack hatched by
Nigerian soldiers in ECOMOG backed by Kamajor militiamen and some
hired mercenary to make Christmas Day a bloody Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to react militarily to any such attack with
all might to ensure that the free movement of people is not
imposed by enemies of the state."
</P>
<P>
Williams urged the public "to hold no fear over their
safety and to attend social functions to celebrate the
yuletide."
</P>
<P>
"The job of the army is to defend all civilians residing in
the country and we are determined to follow this to the
letter," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile local journalists reached in the southern city of
Bo, Sierra Leone's second largest city, denied claims by the
leader of the Kamajors, former deputy defense minister in the
ousted civilian government, Hinga Norman that his militiamen
had blocked all main roads leading to Bo.
</P>
<P>
Travelers arriving in the capital this morning have also
disputed the claim, noting that commuter traffic is flowing
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Norman also claimed in the interview with the clandestine FM
98.1 radio that all areas controlled by Kamajors "are being
turned over to west African peace-keeping troops known as ECOMOG
as part of the deployment program."
</P>
<P>
"We have also mounted a big military operation to dislodge
junta forces along highway check points in the country under
operation Rambo raid," Norman said.
</P>
<P>
Military reports said the first Rambo raid was attempted
Monday at the mile 91 check point leading to the south but
airborne government troops drove the Kamajors into the bush with
aerial bombardment.
</P>
<P>
The Kamajors are also militarily active in about three-tenths
of the country mainly on the fringes of the mining district of
Kono as well as remote villages near the Sierra Leone-Liberian
border in the south.

<HEADLINE> Feature: China Determined to Perform Another "Thames Miracle" (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, December 24 (Xinhua) -- China has determined to clean up
the seriously polluted Huaihe River in three years to complete an
environmental miracle by 2000.
</P>
<P>
"It won't be easy," said a water pollution expert in
Beijing. "Only the British have succeeded in controlling river
pollution. It took them more than four decades to transform a foul
Thames River."
</P>
<P>
China has already spent three years in fighting water pollution
in the Huaihe River Valley, which extends 270,000 square
kilometers, an area slightly larger than Great Britain. More than
5 billion yuan (625 million U.S. dollars) has been spent in
addition to large infusions of manpower and material resources.
</P>
<P>
"The country's largest environmental protection project
witnessed remarkable progress this year," said Qu Geping, chairman
of the Environment and Resources Protection Committee under the
National People's Congress, after a recent tour of the valley.
</P>
<P>
He said the water quality at some major monitoring sites has
been much better. "Some even has approached the level of
drinking-water sources," he said.
</P>
<P>
Residents of the Huaihe River Valley -- Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu
and Shandong provinces -- have been confronted with serious water
pollution problems during the past decade, with 2.4 billion tons
of wastewater pumped into the river each year. In many sections,
fish and shrimp have vanished.

<P>
China currently is trying to ease the river's pollution
problems through strict control of industrial emissions.
</P>
<P>
The government has sent ultimatums to all factories along the
river, demanding that they meet national anti-pollution standards
before Dec. 31 or be shut down.
</P>
<P>
With the deadline drawing near, businessmen have no time to
take a wait-and-see attitude and are expediting pollution control
projects to avoid closure.
</P>
<P>
Some have not hesitated to use circulating funds; others have
sold cars or stopped housing construction for employees to raise
funds. Pollution control has been regarded as a "life project" in
the valley.
</P>
<P>
The world's largest gourmet powder manufacturer, the Lotus
Gourmet Powder Group in central China's Henan Province, has spent
nearly 160 million yuan (20 million U.S. dollars) in pre-treating
wastewater.
</P>
<P>
"The earlier we take action, the better results we may get,"
said the powder group's general manager Li Huaiqing, adding that
it is a road to ruin to refuse to take anti-pollution measures.
</P>
<P>
The latest report from the National Environmental Protection
Agency (NEPA) says that nearly 60 percent of the 1,500-plus major
polluters in the valley, each with more than 100 tons of daily
wastewater emissions, have completed their sewage treatment
projects.

<HEADLINE> China to Tighten Control of Computer Security Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Computer security products,
namely to software and hardware to protect the computer's
information data, must be approved by special agencies designated
by the Ministry of Public Security if they are to enter the
Chinese market, according to a newly promulgated regulation.
</P>
<P>
An official with the ministry said that the new regulation,
which became effective Dec. 12, aims to tighten control of
computer security products and safeguard the security functions of
those products.
</P>
<P>
The regulation says that the computer management and
supervision department under the Ministry of Public Security is
responsible for the approval and issuance of licenses for selling
computer security products.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers of computer security products who have obtained
their licenses should affix a special sign of "sales permission"
which is produced and issued by the Ministry of Public Security.
</P>
<P>
The regulation stresses that no company or individual is
allowed to sell any kind of computer security product without the
"sales permission" sign.
</P>
<P>
The official said the implementation of the regulation will
serve to safeguard the sovereignty of the nation and play an
important role in protecting the rights and interests of computer
users.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has issued a notice calling on public security
bureaus at all levels to strike hard against computer-related
criminal activities in a move to create a favorable environment
for the country's computer industry.

This year's move, together with last year's closure of nearly
5,000 small businesses in the valley, has reduced the emission of
organic pollutants by 40 percent to 890,000 tons a year.
</P>
<P>
"It means we have achieved the goal of the first phase of the
anti-pollution war in the Huaihe River Valley," said NEPA's
Director Xie Zhenhua.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that it still falls far short of the
target to clean up the river.
</P>
<P>
"The river's pollution problem is still serious," Xie said,
pledging that China will "strictly enforce the law" to ensure that
all the businesses along the river meet the national standards at
year's end.
</P>
<P>
Beginning Jan. 1, the anti-pollution war will enter a second
phase in which China will speed up treatment of urban wastewater
while continuing to enhance industrial pollution control efforts.
</P>
<P>
The country will build 47 urban wastewater treatment plants in
the valley by 2000, which is expected to cut the emission of
organic pollutants by another 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that China will spend nearly 20 billion yuan
(2.5 billion U.S. dollars) to combat Huaihe's pollution during the
1998-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
The Huaihe River Valley, with a population of 150 million, is
one of China's important grain and energy producers.

<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, December 24 (Xinhua) -- In the coming three years,
China will speed up the reform of state enterprises, so as to help
most large and medium-sized state firms get rid of the current
difficult situation, while the reform of small state companies
will be completed within two years.
</P>
<P>
Lu Yonghua, Director of the Research Office of the State
Commission for Economic Restructuring, made the remarks during an
interview with Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
These goals set by the government show that the time has been
ripe for making key breakthroughs in the restructuring of state
enterprises and that the reform has entered into an overall and
crucial stage.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the new round of enterprise reform
will be focused on adoption of the modern enterprise system
through clarifying property rights and responsibilities,
separating government and enterprise functions, and adopting
scientific managerial methods.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will be made to reinvigorate large and medium-sized
state companies, especially 1,000 firms in important industries,
while the government will give up its direct control over small
enterprises through various means including merger, bankruptcy,
contracting, leasing and joint stock.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Moi, Kenya's "Big Man" to Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Incumbent Kenyan President
Daniel arap Moi, 73 and in power for 19 years, is widely expected
to beat his 14 challengers and win his final five-year term in
Monday's poll.
</P>
<P>
However, there will be a run-off between the top two
candidates if no one receives at least 25 percent of the vote in
at least five of the country's eight provinces -- the only danger
Moi is facing as analysts say.
</P>
<P>
Moi holds the record as the longest serving president, vice
president and member of parliament in the history of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
"Moi is like a giraffe, while others are like ordinary small
animals. When they are busy grazing down there, the giraffe is
seeing very far," said late opposition FORD-Kenya Chairman
Jaramogi Odinga.
</P>
<P>
"Moi is a person who can stand on a tight rope, juggle with 20
balls and still manage a smile when the pressure is on," the
Kenya Times newspaper quoted an authoritative international
magazine as saying.
</P>
<P>
Also described by the western press, Moi is the last of
Africa's "Big Men" who believe that Africans have always had
their own way of dealing with issues and need no advice from
abroad.
</P>
<P>
"Moi has made his own footprints in the sands of time," said
former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher during her visit
to Kenya in January, 1988.
</P>
<P>
He is also seen as a prominent peace-broker and active
regional cooperation advocate in the Great Lakes region and
eastern Africa -- with his famous Nyato philosophy -- peace, love
and unity.
</P>
<P>
A member of the Tugen sub-group of the minority Kalenjin
ethnic confederation, Moi was born to the first wife of Kimoi
Chebi on September 2, 1924 in Kurieng'ewo village, Sacho, Baringo
district in Rift Valley province.
</P>
<P>
He was the fourth and last child and named Toroitich. After
two years of his birth, his father passed away, and later two of
his brothers also died. Moi was brought up by his mother and
the remaining elder brother.
</P>
<P>
At 10, he walked some 45 kilometers every day to reach
Kabartonjo Africa Inland Mission School, and, after the long walk
home, he helped his mother tending the cattle and goats daily.
</P>
<P>
It was in Kabartonjo that in October 1936, shortly before he
changed schools, Toroitich was baptized into Daniel as a
Christian.
</P>
<P>
First he transferred to another African Inland Mission School
at Kapsabet in 1938 and later to the Government African School,
Kapsabet, where he was the School Football Team Captain.
</P>
<P>
In 1939, Moi took up his first salaried job when he was hired
to drive two head of cattle from Kabarnet to Kapsowar, some 120
km away. The pay was 2.50 Shillings. "I used it to buy a Bible,"
Moi recalled.
</P>
<P>
In 1945, he went to the nearby Kapsabet Teachers Training
College after which he was posted to Kabarnet Intermediate School
as a teacher and became headmaster there in 1948.
</P>
<P>
Moi made his political debut in October, 1955 at the age of 31
when he was nominated as a member of the Legislative Council
which then only included five Africans.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Kenya African Democratic Union (KADU) party was
formed in 1960 and Moi became Chairman.
</P>
<P>
He was appointed Education Minister in the pre-independence
coalition government of 1960/61.
</P>
<P>
When KADU was dissolved in 1964 following a merger with the
Kenya African National Union (KANU) led by late President Jomo
Kenyatta, Moi was appointed Home Affairs Minister.
</P>
<P>
Since January 1967 he was appointed as Kenyatta's vice
president, he had became almost colorless member of the cabinet
who rarely "put a foot wrong," and operated in the deep shadow of
the larger-than-life Kenyatta until August 1978 when Kenyatta
died in Mombasa.
</P>
<P>
Moi succeeded to the presidency peacefully with vows that
he would follow in Kenyatta's footsteps. As an astute chess
master in politics, he included his political foes in his cabinet
and thus quelled their hostility toward him as he built a solid
base.
</P>
<P>
In 1982, an attempted coup led by Kenya Air Force officers was
crushed by forces loyal to Moi in just three hours.
</P>
<P>
Moi bowed reluctantly to pressure from donors and Opposition
groups and introduced multi-party politics in 1991, but bitterly
blaming it for what he perceives to be an upsurge in tribalism,
violence and other social evils.
</P>
<P>
However, he won the first democratic multi-party elections in
December 1992 with 36.8 percent of the vote against seven rivals.
</P>
<P>
Moi is a regular church-goer and is said to start his working
day as early as five in the morning every day.
</P>
<P>
Father of two girls and five boys, he divorced his wife in
1976 and has not remarried.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President on Use of Foreign Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin today
spoke highly of China's efforts in using foreign capital over the
past two decades and urged the relevant departments to do a good
job related to the introduction of foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
When meeting with participants at the National Conference on
Introduction of Foreign Investment in the Great Hall of the
People, Jiang said the use of foreign capital constitutes a major
component of China's opening-up, which is an important part of
Deng Xiaoping Theory and an inevitable road to follow to realize
modernizations and to bring about national revitalization.
</P>
<P>
The use of foreign capital while learning the advanced
technology and management experience has in one way helped to
promote the sustained growth of the national economy and enhanced
the comprehensive national strength and the ability to compete in
the world.
</P>
<P>
Jiang called for absorbing foreign investment in a diversified
way and, in the process, he noted, it it essential to integrate
the use of foreign investment with the country's domestic economic
growth strategy.
</P>
<P>
Confronted with the growing competitions between the nations in
fields of economy, science and technology and comprehensive
national strength, China is now meeting with both new
opportunities and new challenges, Jiang said. The country should
strive to update its opening to a still more multi-faceted,
diversified and wider setup, so as to advance its use of overseas
investment to a new, higher level.
</P>
<P>
In an endeavor to utilize foreign capital well, emphasis should
be placed on raising quality and performance of the national
economy and enhancing the comprehensive national strength and
capability for international competitions by adhering to the
policy of using foreign capital in a still more active, rational
and effective way, he said. Moreover, he added, active efforts
should be made to guide foreign investment into agriculture,
high-tech and infrastructure sectors, as well as to
export-oriented production projects.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of ranking officials and representatives working in
foreign trade and economic sectors from across China attended the
three-day conference, whose main theme is to map out a blueprint
for the country's use of foreign capital in the 21st century.

<P>
Currently, China has over 14,500 large and medium-sized state
enterprises and over 300,000 small ones, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
China plans to standardize large and medium-sized state firms
by clarifying the investors and multiplying the share-holding
rights, and to encourage non-banking institutions and legal
persons including non-government companies to join in the
restructuring of state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The majority of state firms will be turned into limited
companies, while large and medium-sized key state companies are
expected to adopt the modern enterprise system by the end of the
century.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the state will encourage the establishment of
trans-regional and trans-industrial, large enterprise groups
through stock-holding, based on the capital and adopting market
mechanism.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the state will withdraw its capital from
small state firms gradually to let them compete on the market, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government will change its method of control
over the enterprises by adopting the system of investorship, so as
to realize an effective supervision and control over state
properties, and the mechanism of operation and value-increasing
mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, efforts will be made to improve the system of legal
person properties, to create a mechanism for enterprises to
compete on an equal footing, while the employment system will also
be improved, so as to let workers find a job through mutual
selection. In addition, enterprise leaders should be selected
through competition.

<HEADLINE> China to Improve Basic Social Security System in Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Introducing and improving the
basic social security system in urban area will be the most
important task for civil affairs work in 1998, a senior official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Introducing the system for urban residents is vital to
reforming the traditional social relief system and perfecting the
social security system, State Councillor Li Guixiang told a
national conference on civil affairs which closed here today.
</P>
<P>
He said that the system can help maintain social stability
and advance economic reforms, while giving a full play to the
superiority of the socialist system.
</P>
<P>
"The sooner it is instituted throughout the country, the
greater benefits it will bring to economic and social
development," Li noted.
</P>
<P>
More than 270 cities, or over 40 percent of the country's
total, have introduced the system. Some 70 cities have instituted
the system over the past three months.
</P>

<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists and
technicians should make greater contributions to the country's
economic development, said Wen Jiabao, a member of the Political
Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting of China Association for Science and
Technology (CAST), Wen said that the nearly 20 million Chinese
scientists and technicians should further intergrate science and
technology with economic development, expand academic exchanges,
and strengthen the work of popularizing science and technology
with the public.
</P>
<P>
He added that China should strengthen its research in basic
sciences, and at the same time develop high-technologies and turn
advanced technology into a productive force.
</P>
<P>
He said that China should improve its environment of
international technological exchanges to narrow the gap with
developed countries.
</P>

Zhou Guangzhao, president of CAST, said that next year -- the
20th anniversary of Deng Xiaoping's statement that "Science and
Technology is the No.1 productive force" and the 40th anniversary
of the founding of CAST -- the association will expand
international academic exchanges and train more high-quality
scientists and technicians.

<P>
TOKYO, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Japanese customs officials and
police said Wednesday that they have confiscated about 5.7 kilograms of
marijuana resin from a German man who tried to smuggle the narcotic
through Tokyo's Narita International airport earlier this month.
</P>

Karl-Heinz Wolf, the drug carrier, was arrested on suspicion of
violating the Cannabis Control Law following his arrival from
Singapore on December 7, when customs inspectors found the resin
hidden in the false bottom of his suitcase.

<P>
The confiscated resin, with a street value of about 46 million yen
(about 353,846 dollars), is the second largest amout seized at Narita
airport this year.

<HEADLINE> China to Make New Breakthroughs in Enterprise Reform (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new managerial system should be set up in a bid to let the
investor, manager and staff encourage and supervise over one
another, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the reform of state firms has experienced four
stages of "relaxing government control and giving enterprises more
profits", "contracting", transformation of mechanism, and creation
of a new system.
</P>
<P>
Great achievements have been made in this regard, however,
quite a large number of state companies are still losing money and
indebted, due to the confusion of property rights and
responsibilities, mixing-up of government and enterprise
functions and outdated managerial methods, the lack of an
operational mechanism that is energetic and meets the requirements
of the socialist market economy, Lu noted.
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese economists believe that the restructuring of state
firms in the country has entered into a crucial but difficult
time.
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, most large and medium-sized state companies
are making efforts to survive from the current difficult
situation. On the other hand, these firms have to adopt the modern
enterprise system. The only way-out is to set up a new system, the
experts hold.
</P>
<P>
To ensure a smooth restructuring of state companies, the
government plans to push forwards the macro-economic
restructuring, including restructuring of the investment system,
in order to improve the system macro-economic control.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government plans to accelerate the establishment
and improvement of the social security system and rearrange
laid-offs from state factories through various channels, so as to
create a sound environment for the restructuring of state
enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Economy to Maintain Stable Growth Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese economy is
expected to maintain its appropriate and stable growth next year
with reforms of state-owned enterprises, the financial industry,
housing and government institutions to be carried out on a larger
scale.
</P>
<P>
Qiu Xiaohua, chief economist of the State Statistics Bureau
(SSB), delivered this message in an exclusive interview with
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese economy will grow 8-to-10 percent next
year.
</P>
<P>
The economist foresaw no major increases in the retail market
but believed that the housing market will become more active with
government measures to encourage consumption of residential houses.
</P>
<P>
A joint report by SSB and the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences points out that the Chinese economy will not grow too
fast because China's investment scale will not grow excessively
following the country's persistence in its "relatively tight"
credit policy for fear of accumulating bad debts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, financial system reforms will strengthen commercial
banks' resistance against the local government's interference,
making it harder for borrowers to obtain money from commercial
banks.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for unwanted faster economic growth is a
prediction by the State Information Center, which is sponsored by
the State Planning Commission, a slowdown could occur in the
country's export growth next year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chinese financial experts forecast that, despite the
recent financial turmoil around the world, the exchange rate of
Renminbi against the U.S. dollar will remain stable.
</P>
<P>
China's rising foreign exchange reserves and stringent control
over foreign currencies will provide a safe haven for the Renminbi
against international speculators, they said.
</P>
<P>
However, most economists are pessimistic about China's domestic
commodities market, saying that the growth rate for the sale of
capital goods will likely dip lower than the growth rate of the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
Economists agree that the reform of state-owned enterprises
will continue to be the most important task for the national
economy in 1998, and that it is the most crucial factor affecting
the performance of the national economy.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique's Economy Grows for Five Consecutive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Li Fuxiang)
</P>
<P>
MAPUTO, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Ever since peace dwells in
Mozambique in 1992, the country has witnessed economic growth for
five consecutive years, with domestic gross product this year is
expected to reach 1.7 billion U.S. dollars, a 6.6 percent
increase over last year.
</P>
<P>
Inflation rate dropped from 54.9 percent in 1995 to 17 percent
last year. This year, the rate could be down at seven percent.
</P>
<P>
After remarkable depreciations for the past few years, Metica,
the national currency, was stable last year. Its exchange rate
with the U.S. dollar only depreciated by one percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture and animal husbandry output has grown by 5.9
percent, with grain harvest of over 1.53 million tons, a 11
percent increase over last year. The cotton output has reached
over 70,000 tons, a record high in the country since its
independence.
</P>
<P>
The industrial and fishery outputs also increased by nine
percent, with food and beverage industries growing by more than
30 percent. The rubber and plastics industry, which is of major
importance in the country's industrial structure, has grown by 14
percent.
</P>
<P>
The mining sector, despite its deep slide last year, has a
boost of about 15 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The economic development should be attributed to political
stability, and measures taken by the government to boost the
economy. Half of the 653 million dollars investments approved by
the government before June went to the industrial and
agriculturial fields.
</P>
<P>
The loan interest for national currency has dropped by 13 to
20 percentage point. The current loan interest rates are between
19 percent to 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
Import volume in the first half of this year has reduced by 17
percent compared with the same period last year. Among them,
imports of food and consumer products have been greatly decreased
which helps to promot domestic production.
</P>
<P>
Reforms on the Customs since last May have also brewed
results, bringing in an average monthly taxes of seven million
dollars for international trade during the first half of this
year, and 10 million dollars monthly taxes for the second half.
</P>
<P>
Starting from 1987, the privatization process in the country
has quicken its pace this year, with 846 out of the 1,254
registered state-run enterprises already privatised. Management
of the enterprises are now improving, with unemployment going
down.
</P>
<P>
At present, capital, unemployment, social security still
remain to be factors affecting the economic development in the
country. However, the prospects for Mozambique's economy are
bright.

BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- China will open further to the
outside world and continue to make use of foreign investment in an
active, rational and efficient manner to help promote the fast and
healthy growth of the economy and the overall social progress.
</P>
<P>
With an eye on the 21st century, the country will focus on

</P>
<P>
That was the conclusion at a national conference on utilization

<HEADLINE> Revised Draft Law n Price Accentuates Market Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- China is determined to reform
its pricing system. A revised draft law on price, which places
more stress on market forces in price formation, demonstrates that
determination.
</P>
<P>
The second draft of a pricing system law has been submitted for
examination to the country's highest legislative body, the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, which began
its 29th meeting here today.
</P>
<P>
The revised draft stipulates that China adopts and will
gradually perfect a price system with market forces playing a
major role.
</P>
<P>
"Prices should be set to reflect market value and the law of
governing the market value. Therefore, prices for most commodities
and services should be left to market regulation; only very few
commodities and services should be subject to prices set by the
government or under government guidance."
</P>
<P>
To minimize government interference, the draft has limited the
scope of government-set prices to those including "very few
commodities that have a vital bearing on the livelihood of the
general public as well as the national economy; some commodities
that are scant in natural resources, commodities that are
naturally monopolized by government such as electricity; major
public utilities and welfare service charges."
</P>
<P>
The revised draft law demands the establishment of a system of
public hearings. When the government wants to adjust prices on
public utilities or welfare service charges, it should solicit
opinions from the general public.

<TEXT>
<P>
In the meantime, while accelerating the restructuring of state
companies, greater efforts have to be made to improve the
country's social security system and to deal with the issues of
unemployment and re-employment.
</P>
<P>
The government has made progress in this concern: state factory
laid-offs, numbering millions, have received assistance from the
government-sponsored re-employment programs.
</P>
<P>
According to central government policy, China plans in the
coming three years to push a strategic re-organization of large
state enterprises by setting up large groups in important
industries.
</P>
<P>
The pace of reforming small state firms will also be speeded up
by such methods as re-organization, merger, leasing, contracting,
joint-stock and selling-out.
</P>
<P>
The current difficulties faced by state enterprises are
temporary. No matter how hard it will be, the reform must be
carried through to the end.
</P>
<P>
In the next three years many state companies may survive the
market competition and continue to be the backbone of China's
economic development.

<TEXT>
<P>
The conference analyzed the chances and challenges China faces
in further drawing foreign investment: the swift progress of
science and technology which has infiltrated economic growth; the
growing scope of international capital and funds, while
circulation speed accelerates; how financial internationalization
greatly affects the economy of various countries; how
international direct investment has become a great impetus for
economic globalization; and multi-national companies becoming
important forces for global resources.
</P>
<P>
Based on these circumstances, the conference held that in the
future China should grasp the following aspects in using foreign
investment:
</P>
<P>
-- The scope of using foreign investment should cater to the
overall development requirements of the economy and embody the
extent of the opening-up policy.
</P>
<P>
-- More advanced and applied science and technology should be
attracted to help remove the obstacles in national economic and
social growth.
</P>
<P>
-- A basic balance between international expenditure and
revenue should be maintained with some surplus, while the Renminbi
value should be kept stable to enhance the coordination of foreign
trade, foreign investment, foreign exchange earnings and foreign
debts.
</P>
<P>
To better draw foreign investment in the future, participants
held that the existing foreign-invested enterprises should be
well-managed. And economic zones such as the Pudong New Area in
Shanghai and the Suzhou Industrial Park in east China's Jiangsu
Province should further improve their investment
environment. Other important elements include updating the legal
system, protecting intellectual property rights, and adjusting
relevant policies in a timely way to help promote the opening-up
drive.

<HEADLINE> Top Ten International News Events of 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are top ten
world news events in 1997 selected by the Xinhua News Agency:
</P>
<P>
1. British Scientists Successfully Clone Sheep Using Cell of
</P>
<P>
Adult Sheep, Making Breakthrough in Bio-Engineering
</P>
<P>
British scientists at Edinburgh's Roslin Institute announced on
February 23 that they had created a lamb, named "Dolly," from a
single cell taken from the udder of an adult sheep, the world's
first clone of an adult animal.
</P>
<P>
The success is a breakthrough in bio-engineering, but it soon
aroused concerns over its possible negative effects on ecological
environment and ethical guidelines if the cloning technology is
applied in duplicating human beings.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO) adopted a document against human cloning, in
Paris on November 11.
</P>
<P>
2. Five Nations Strike Accord on Border Arms Reduction,
</P>
<P>
Creating New Model of Safeguarding Regional Security
</P>
<P>
Presidents of China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and
Tajikistan signed an agreement in Moscow on April 24 on reduction
of armed forces in their border areas.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, the first of its kind in the Asia Pacific region
and also a result of over seven years of negotiations, manifested
a new model for safeguarding regional security which is different
from the cold-war mentality.
</P>
<P>
It represents a fresh move in handling inter-state relations
and regional security issues and will exert a positive impact on
world peace and stability.

</P>
<P>
In a written statement issued at the airport, Qian spoke highly
of the time-honored friendship between Egypt and China.

<P>
"Despite drastic changes in international and regional
situations, the sincere and strong friendship between the Chinese
and Egyptian peoples based on mutual respect and understanding has
constantly been deepened, and cooperation scope has been expanded
day by day," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have always supported, and cooperated with,
each other in international affairs, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe, in the current new world situation, more exchange
of visits by leaders of the two countries are conducive to
deepening mutual understanding, expanding consensus, promoting
friendship and cooperation," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese foreign minister also highlighted the significant
role of Egypt in the Middle East, Africa and international affairs.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
"I believe my visit (to Cairo) will be conducive to the
enhancement of existing Sino-Egyptian friendly and cooperative
relations and to the promotion of the cause of peace in the Middle
East," he added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the last leg of Qian's current Middle East tour which
has already taken him to Lebanon, Syria, Israel and the
Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Absorbs $502 million of Foreign Investment in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria absorbed 502 million
U.S. dollars of foreign investment in 1997, which is nearly twice
the 1996 figure and 15 times that of 1992, local media reported.
</P>
<P>
Among the foreign investors, Germany ranked first with 261.8
million dollars, accounting for 20.2 percent of the total. It was
followed by Belgium with 251.6 million dollars, the Netherlands,
Britain and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria attributed the increase of foreign investment to the
currency policy introduced by the government last July and the
announcement to allow the country's lev to float with the
U.S. dollar, which generally stablized the country's financial
situation, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bulgaria also amended its foreign investment law and
put forward a set of policies to encourage overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
According to the government plan between 1998-2005, Bulgaria
is expected to absorb 4.5-5 billion dollars from overseas in the
period of 1998-2003.
</P>
<P>
After that, it will get some 6.4 billion dollars from such
international financial institutions as the International Monetary
Fund, the report said.

<P>
CANBERRA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Australian Federal Finance
Minister John Fahey Wednesday promised ministerial action to solve
the so-called millennium bug after an auditor-general's report
found commonwealth agencies were not taking the risk seriously.
</P>
<P>
All ministers had been told that the year 2000 issue was not
simply an information technology problem within their portfolio,
but was a serious management problem, Fahey said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) report would help
raise awareness among both the public and private sector of the
serious consequences of the problem, Fahey said.
</P>
<P>
The millennium bug is expected to cause chaos at the turn of
the century when many computers will be unable to represent the
year 2000 with two digits.
</P>
<P>
Crucial services such as fire alarms, building lifts, medical
imaging systems, lab instruments, radiotherapy equipment and
critical care patient management systems are liable to be hit by
the bug.
</P>
<P>
But ANAO found that the majority of agencies surveyed were not
following a systematic and structured approach to identifying,
ranking and treating the risks.
</P>
<P>
Fahey said the government had strengthened the risk
identification regime since the ANAO surveyed the agencies six
months ago, each was now required to report quarterly on their
progress towards compliance in 2000, he said.

<HEADLINE> Despite GCC Stand on Iran, Iraq, Differences Remain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has expressed
welcome to the results of the just-concluded Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) summit, especially its calls on Iraq to implement
all relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
This was sounded at a Kuwaiti cabinet meeting Tuesday night,
which showed mixed feelings toward GCC's desire to better
relations with Iran, and to allow Iraq to come back to the Arab
world after it complies with all U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait, a victim of Iraqi invasion in 1990 which triggered the
Gulf Crisis, insisted on ruling out reconciliation with the Iraqi
regime at the three-day summit last week.
</P>
<P>
It said there should be a "distinction between Arab
reconciliation and reconciliation with the Iraqi regime" and "the
two can never meet."
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here noted that Kuwait's attitude on this issue runs,
to some extent, counter to an appeal made by the Saudi Crown
Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz, in his arrival statement last
Saturday, for the Gulf Arab states to "overcome their painful
past" and abandon "isolationist concepts."
</P>
<P>
The GCC Secretary General Jamil Hujailan, while talking to
reporters on the sidelines of the summit last Sunday, echoed this
call by saying that "this is a common stand of the GCC states."
</P>
<P>
Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassem Bin Jabir
Al-Thani also stressed the need that Iraq returns to the Arab
world after its implementation of relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
However, during the past two days, Kuwaiti government officials
categorically ruled out any reconciliation with Baghdad, despite
Kuwait's "great concern over the sufferings of the Iraqi people."
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Information Minister Sheikh Saud Nasser Al-Sabah said
that "Kuwait's wound inflicted by the Iraqi regime and its
treachery is still painful and deep and will only be cured by the
disappearance of the bloody regime in Iraq."
</P>
<P>
"Let us not be driven by sentiments and let us be firm in
handling the regime in Baghdad," he added.
</P>
<P>
The GCC was founded in 1981 at a time when Iraq and Iran was in
war and groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, the United
Emirates (UAE) and Oman in a political and economic alliance.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, private statements by the GCC states other than the
agreed expressions in the summit's final communique concerning
Iran also give an insight into the marginal differences regarding
improvement process of GCC's ties with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait, which has been on better terms with Iran, said it is
convinced about the necessity to create a security system for the
Gulf states including Iran, which is a big and powerful country in
the region.
</P>
<P>
While the UAE, which has been locked in a territorial dispute
with Iran over three Gulf islands of Greater and Lesser Tunbs and
Abu Moussa, still expressed reservation about a rapid cooperation
with Iran before the dispute was resolved.
</P>
<P>
The UAE said it has not observed any positive and concrete act
yet by Iran to solve the issue of the islands so far.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, other GCC members reiterated its "full support
to the UAE sovereignty over the islands" now occupied by Iran and
expressed welcome to "any meeting to be concluded between the
leaders of the two countries" that could lead to a settlement of
the dispute.
</P>
<P>
On Iran-GCC relations, Qatar's foreign minister said "they are
distinguished", while Bahraini Emir Sheikh Issa Bin Salman
Al-Khalifa said "I don't think we can talk of any security
partnership (with Iran) unless we overcome all these issues"
including Iran's ongoing occupation of the islands.
</P>
<P>
Despite the differences, the GCC summit did agree to better
relations with Iran and emerge for the first time to take a
coordinating stand on Iraq as the final communique showed.

<HEADLINE> India to Develop Vaccine Against AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 24 (Xinhua)-- The Indian government has
decided to develop a vaccine against AIDS which spread fast in the
country, Press Trust of India (PTI) said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
India has lost a 11-year battle to control AIDS with slogans,
condoms and a 100 million U.S. dollar World Bank loan in the past.
More than three million Indians are estimated to have been
infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), making India a
country with the largest number of HIV cases in the world, PTI
said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no alternative. Educational campaigns have not made a
dent and anti-AIDS drugs are not affordable even by rich Indians.
We have the advantage of having skilled people, and with a
concerted national effort, we can make a vaccine," PTI quoted
medical researcher v. Ramalingaswami as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Even if we do not succeed in making a vaccine, it is time for
us to start working on it rather than wait until some one comes
out with a vaccine and asks us to buy it," said Satish Gupta of
the National Institute of Immunology here.

role in promoting sustained economic growth and the overall reform
and opening-up in the country, said Minister of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation Wu Yi here today.
</P>
<P>
Wu delivered a report at a national conference on foreign
investment which closed today, elaborating on China's achievements
in this aspect.
</P>
<P>
From 1979 to November 1997, she said, China approved more than
302,400 foreign-funded enterprises involving contracted investment
of 513.42 billion U.S. dollars. Of that committed investment, 216.6
billion U.S. dollars has actually been put to use.
</P>
<P>
The most rapid increase in foreign investment has occurred
in the five years following 1992, however, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Since then China has approved 241,317 foreign-funded projects
involving 417.698 billion U.S. dollars of contracted investment, of
which 151.537 billion U.S. dollars have been used. The foreign
funding already spent accounted for 13.94 percent of the the
country's total investment in fixed assets.
</P>
<P>
Wu said foreign investment has fueled the sustained, rapid and
sound development of the nation's economy and improved social
stability.
</P>
<P>
By introducing foreign funding China has increased its
financial income, created job opportunities and upgraded the
people's living standard.
</P>
<P>
At present, more than 17.5 million people are working for the
145,000 foreign-financed enterprises, accounting for 10 percent of
the country's non-rural labor force.
</P>
<P>
During the 1992-1996 period taxation on foreign companies,
mainly from foreign-funded enterprises, reached 211.998 billion
yuan, with an annual increase rate of 58.11 percent.
</P>
<P>
The taxation on foreign companies in 1996 accounted for 11.88
percent of the year's total taxes on industrial and commercial
companies, compared to 4.25 percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The absorption of foreign funding has also emancipated ideas,
pushed economic restructuring and stimulated the formation of a
market economy, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
During the last two decades or so, the establishment of joint
ventures and cooperative enterprises have spurred on technical
innovation at more than 120,000 state-owned or collectively-owned
enterprises, and a large number of technical and management
professionals have emerged.
</P>
<P>
The state or collectively-owned economic elements within mixed
ownerships has increased these enterprises' value along with the
rapid growth of the mixed economy.
</P>
<P>
This has effectively promoted the transfer of the traditional
ownership structure, and has an important impact on the formation
of a development mode which keeps the public-owned economy in a
dominant place and allows economically diverse forms to develop
side-by-side.
</P>
<P>
This has also played an active role on the formulation of
China's basic economic system at this primary stage of socialism.

<HEADLINE> Wu Yi on China's Introduction of Foreign Investment (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Foreign-funded businesses brought competition and the market
mechanism, accelerated the integration of overseas and domestic
markets and promoted the formation and development of China's
markets of capital, labor, technology and information, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
She added that the introduction of advanced technology and
management know-how has spurred adjustments in China's economic
and industrial structures.
</P>
<P>
The advanced technology, equipment and products absorbed by
China as investment have helped to improve technology in such
fields as machine-building, electricity, telecommunications,
automobiles, chemicals, light-industry, textiles, building
materials and food-processing, she said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, many high-tech industries have been rapidly
created and the product-technology gap between China and developed
countries has been greatly shortened, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
She went on to say that foreign investment has also laid a
solid foundation for further escalation of the industrial
structure in China's coastal regions.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of foreign investment has furthered the growth
of China's foreign trade and accelerated the integrity of China's
economy and the world's, she added.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the foreign trade volume of China's foreign-funded
businesses reached 137.1 billion U.S. dollars, more than triple
that in 1992 with an average annual growth of 33.05 percent. The
figure is 47.3 percent of China's total foreign trade in 1996,
compared with 26.43 percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Wu also acknowledged that the foreign investment improved
China's balance of foreign exchange because, since 1987,
foreign-funded businesses have maintained a favorable balance of
payment as a whole for 10 years, and the net surplus has increased
year by year.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the payment surplus of foreign-funded businesses
amounted to 11.424 billion U.S. dollars, 40 percent of China's
total, up 90.94 percent over 1995.
</P>
<P>
In the first 10 months of this year, the surplus of businesses
reached 15.119 billion U.S. dollars, 82.27 percent more than the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Wu told the conference that in the last 20 years investment
from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan accounted for 64.89 percent of
the total overseas investment in China. The investment from these
three regions does not only consolidate their economic ties with
the mainland, but also furthers their economic development.
</P>
<P>
Investments from the United States, Japan, European countries,
the Republic of Korea (ROK) and Singapore also have played an
important role in promoting their economic ties and bilateral
relations with China, the minister said.

<HEADLINE> Year-Ender: State Enterprise Reform Enters Crucial Stage (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- In 1997 China stepped up
efforts to restructure its state-owned enterprises as more than
3,000 of them went bankrupt or merged, while a number of large
enterprise groups were newly established.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring of state enterprises, which has been regarded
as a key part of the current economic reform, has now entered its
crucial stage.
</P>
<P>
Since late 1978 when China launched its reform, opening and
modernization drive, the reform of state-owned companies has gone
through several stages.
</P>
<P>
Until 1982 state firms had mainly tried to gain greater
decision-making rights for their internal affairs. Between 1983-86
state companies practiced various systems of responsibility. In
the 1987-92 period state firms worked hard to improve their
management and deepen the reform.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993 the reform has focused on transforming the mechanism
of state enterprises and adopting the modern enterprise system.
</P>
<P>
The 512 key firms, which account for 1 percent of state-owned
enterprises in the country, boast 55 percent of the total assets,
60 percent of sales and 85 percent of pre-tax profits. Meanwhile,
a large number of state firms have sailed into troubled
waters.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Govt Said to Be Shocked at Coup Plot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The initial feeling of the
Nigerian government was that of a shock over Sunday's foiled coup
plot involving the country's number two person Chief of General
Staff Oladipo Diya, a close aide to the head of state said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"In terms of expectations, there was a general expression of
shock," said Chief David Attah, Chief Press Secretary for the
head of state, quoted by press reports today.
</P>
<P>
However everybody is beginning to recover, Attah said shortly
after the opening of a meeting of the Provisional Ruling Council
(PRC), the nation's highest policy making body, of which Diya was
the sole vice-chairman, last night in the capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
PRC members, mostly senior military officers, began their
meeting at about 8:00 last night to deliberate on the botched
alleged coup and assess the general security situation and the
prop?d 1998 budget.
</P>
<P>
According to Attah, preliminary investigations are still on
and more information on the progress made so far will be made
public as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
But the newly-sworn in Mnister of Information and Culture,
Chief Ikeobasi Mokelu, noted that the government has to take time
to provide informtion about the aborted coup because of the
nature of the plot and it did not want to compromise national
security.
</P>
<P>
"We must not allow undue haste to supply information either to
compromise vital interests or lead to miscarriage of justice," he
said in Abuja.
</P>
<P>
The minister promised that he will supply "timely and
adequate" information that will be "truthful, credible and
impartial".
</P>
<P>
In Lagos, defense spokesman Godwin Ugbo also appealed
Nigerians and the international community to "waiting for the
outcome of investigation into the attempted overthrow".
</P>
<P>
According to Ugbo, it took three months for people to start to
believe that there was indeed a coup plot when a coup attempt was
announced by the defense headquarters in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Like the situation in 1995 coup plot, which involved former
Head of wState Olusegun Obasanjo and his deputy Sheghu Musas
Yar'adua, anyone who was cleared would be released after a
thorough investigation to determine the level of involvement of
the persons arrested, he added.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 12 people, including Diya, two other generals, four
colonels and one lt.-colonel, were arrested in the coup plot
uncovered last Sunday.

<HEADLINE> China Faces Challenges in Developing Accounting Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- China's public accounting
market faces both opportunities and challenges, a senior industry
official said today.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment and improvement of a socialist market
economic structure have created a good environment and favorable
conditions for the development of the country's accounting
industry," Cui Jianmin, president of the Chinese Association of
Certified Public Accountants (CACPA), said at a national meeting
of his association.
</P>
<P>
The development of a market economy, reforms of the state-owned
enterprises and implementation of a system requiring the annual
accounting sheets of enterprises to be audited by CPAs will
combine to create a huge market for accounting services, Cui said.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's public accounting industry has experienced
rapid growth in the last 18 years. Official figures indicate that
China currently has 133,000 CPAs and 6,900 accountants' offices.
</P>
<P>
However, the current status of China's public accounting
industry is far from adequate to meet the need of developing a
market economy in the country, Cui said.
</P>
<P>
Most of China's accounting offices are too small and some
accountants and accounting offices have failed to demonstrate
sufficient legal, risk and self-discipline awareness, he said.
</P>
<P>
Increasingly fierce competition from overseas firms has posed a
serious challenge to China's public accounting industry, according
to Cui.
</P>
<P>
Many of the largest accounting firms in the world have
established their presence in China. The cooperative offices of
the world's six largest accounting firms, including Earnst &AMP;
Young, account for less than 0.1 percent of the total number of
accounting firms in China, but 10 percent of the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
While China is opening its accounting market, it will also
formulate and implement effective measures to help sharpen the
competitive edge of its accounting firms, Cui said.

<TEXT>
<P>
The average debt rate for China's state enterprises has
exceeded 65 percent, and more than 20 percent of the firms have
ceased operations, completely or partially. Thousands of small
state companies have been sold and leased out, or merged with
others.
</P>
<P>
To date, the country's registered unemployment in urban areas
has surpassed 3 percent as six million workers have been laid off
from state factories.
</P>
<P>
The current difficult situation of the state sector has been
caused by poor management, the changing of a seller's market into
a buyer's market, the heavy historical burdens as well as the
long-time confusion between the functions of the government and
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The main tasks remaining are to transform the function and
mechanism of state enterprises, and to rebuild the relationship
between state firms and the government, customers, banks and
enterprises of other ownerships.
</P>
<P>
State-enterprise reform not only relies on the companies' own
efforts, but also on improvement in the external environment,
especially the reform of government.

<HEADLINE> Thai Banks Start Fixing Millennium Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 24 (Xinhua) -- A large Thai commercial bank
believes that over 70 percent of its 4,400 computer software
programs used in its operations will be affected by the date
change in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Siam Commercial Bank has spent the last 15 months examining
its computer programs and is now working on modifying over 2.7
million lines of computer code, according to a Bangkok Post report
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Problems will occur in software when the two digit number for
the year 2000 (y2k) becomes '00'. In addition, the year 1999 will
also cause problems, as dates such as 1/1/99 and 9/9/99 are often
used by programmers to indicate an exceptional situation. Thus,
when these dates are entered in a database, unexpected things may
happen.
</P>
<P>
No business will be unaffected by the y2k impact and banks tend
to be more affected in two years' time, unless problem codes are
modified, the newspaper quotes specialists as warning.
</P>
<P>
However, the real threat the y2k problem poses may lie in
hazards from weapon systems, munitions depots, nuclear plants and
medical systems, where an error can be fatal.
</P>
<P>
Somchai Chilayon, a Microsoft consulting services manager, even
cautioned that when the new year comes around in two years' time,
do not fly in any aircraft, or take a boat or even an elevator.
</P>
<P>
Since all companies which have computer systems will have to
face this problem, some specialists call it a national issue and
urge government agencies to address it.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Rebound in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Tokyo Stocks rebounded Wednesday
for the first time in four trading days this week following a
recovery in several international blue chips.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei average of 225 selected issues on the First Section of
the Tokyo Stock Exchange ended at 14,924.98, up 125.58 points, or
0.85 percent, from Monday's close.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
issues on the First Section, rose 4.59 points, or 0.41 percent, to
1,134.59.
</P>
<P>
Share prices bounced back for the first time after a major
1700-point loss over the previous three trading days.
</P>
<P>
Volume on the First Section came to an estimated 550 million
shares, down from Monday's 676.69 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Collapsed Yamaichi Securities Co. was today's most actively
traded issue.
</P>
<P>
The drop in bank issues slowed after the midmorning announcement
that the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and its two noncabinet
allies had decided to endorse a 13 trillion yen (about 100 billion
dollars) bank recapitalization plan.
</P>
<P>
While bank issues remained weak, high-tech, electrical and
automobile blue chips rose in the afternoon, leading the benchmark
Nikkei to briefly top the 15,000 mark.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,327 issues listed on the First Section, losers outpaced
gainers 671 to 497 with 125 issues unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Exports Up 19.8 Percent in First 10 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's exports grew 19.8
percent in the first 10 months this year, reaching 1.3 trillion
baht, thanks largely to the plunging value of the baht.
</P>
<P>
However, in terms of U.S. dollars, the export value for the
period rose only by 4.4 percent, to 48 billion dollars, based on
an average exchange rate of 27 baht to the dollar, according to
the commerce ministry figures available Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During the 10-month period and in baht terms, industrial
exports grew 18.4 percent, agribusiness exports increased 10.9
percent, and agricultural exports raised 4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, imports during the 10 months dropped by 10.1 percent
in dollar terms, with imports of vehicles and auto parts declined
and fuel, capital products, raw and semi-finished materials
increased.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the country's trade account was 53.6 percent lower
than the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The ministry forecast that exports for the entire year would
expand by 3.5 percent in dollars, and by 26 percent in baht.
</P>
<P>
Although the weaker baht has helped exports dramatically by
making them cheaper, the positive impact would last only two
years, the ministry said. It urged producers and exporters to
improve product quality and competitiveness.

<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese top women diver Wang
Rui was dropped from the Chinese team for January's World Swimming
Championships in Perth, Australia.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who won four titles in international meets this year,
has withdrawn from the 11-day championships because of nagging
neck and back injuries, Shi Tianshu, director of the China
Swimming Administrative Center, confirmed here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The diver from Beijing is hailed as heir apparent to China's
three-time Olympic champion Fu Mingxia, who retired after winning
two gold medals in the Atlanta Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Wang started the year of 1997 with a platform title at the
Beijing international diving meet in January. She then triumphed

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 24 (Xinhua) - Hong Kong's stock market
remained weak in the week amid a regional financial crisis which
has showed no signs of settling down.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Hang Seng Index lost 63.37 points or 0.6 percent
to finish the holiday-shortened week to Wednesday at 10,342.44.
</P>
<P>
Trading day-to-day depends on what's going on in other markets,
particularly Tokyo and Seoul which are embroiled in financial
woes, said dealers.
</P>
<P>
The value of turnover was very thin with investors standing on
the sidelines. For the three-day trading week, 14.159 billion Hong
Kong dollars (1.82 billion U.S. dollars) worth of shares changed
hands, compared with 35.976 billion HK dollars (4.61 billion
U.S. dollars) for the previous five-day trading week.
</P>
<P>
Following a 2.0 percent drop in the previous week, the market
was off to a bearish start Monday with the blue-chip index losing
233.34 points or 2.24 percent to 10,172.47 on the heel of a
decline on Wall Street.

The index gained 195.63 points, or 1.92 percent, to close at

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HK External Trade Grows Steadily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's external trade
has maintained a modest growth in a year of political transition
and regional financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Latest government statistics show that Hong Kong's visible
trade in the first three quarters reached 2,255 billion HK dollars
(290 billion US dollars), up four percent over the same period of
1996. Re-exports rose steadily by 3.7 percent to hit 909 billion
HK dollars (116 billion US dollars), while domestic exports
dropped slightly by 1.2 percent to 155 billion HK dollars (about
20 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's external trade was not affected much by the
regional financial crisis, which toppled down many Asian
currencies to historic lows, said economists.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Fernow, head of research of Vickers Ballas Hong Kong
said that depreciation of currencies could boost export
competitiveness of other Asian economies, but Hong Kong no longer
competes head-to-head with countries like the Philippines and
Thailand on prices as it concentrates mainly on higher value added
production.
</P>
<P>
Victor Fung, chairman of the Hong Kong Trade and Development
Council (TDC), said that Hong Kong is still competitive because it
can successfully put into practice the so-called "supply chain
management" -- the science of choosing the best place for each
link in the production chain.
</P>
<P>
A Hong Kong businessman can combine the Republic of Korea's
cloth and Taiwan accessories at a factory in Indonesia, say, to
quickly produce clothes of the latest fashion for export to
Europe, Fung gave an example. There are more than 300,000 small-
and medium-sized enterprises in Hong Kong, and 40 percent of them
are involved in this kind of transnational operation.
</P>
<P>
"We don't compete on cheap prices. We are packagers and
integrators to offer a high value added "total package", ranging
from design to quality control, marketing, financing, and
customization," said Fung, who also chaired the board of Li &AMP; Fung
Group, a leading Hong Kong trading company.
</P>
<P>
The role of "packager" has boosted Hong Kong's exports of
services and offshore trade. Its exports of services have tripled
over the past decade to 288 billion HK dollars (37 billion US
dollars) in 1996, ranking ninth in the world.
</P>
<P>
Exports of services, mainly comprising transportation, travel
and trade-related services, posted robust growth between January
and June this year, up 5.3 percent to 145 billion HK dollars (18
billion US dollars). However, the TDC predicted that performance
for the whole year might be adversely affected by the slump in
tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Offshore trade is hard to calculate, but the TDC said that this
form of trade has expanded strongly since the early 1990s to take
an increasingly share of the total external trade.
</P>
<P>
China's inland areas continue to be a powerful engine pushing
Hong Kong's trade forward steadily. In the first three quarters
this year, Hong Kong re-exported to and from the inland areas a
total of 851 billion HK dollars (109 billion US dollars) worth of
goods and services, an increase of five percent over the same
period of 1996. At the same time, Hong Kong's domestic exports to
the inland areas rose by 3.6 percent. The inland areas remain the
largest trading partner of Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> HK People Have Positive Outlook of Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The year 1997 has seen the
highest confidence level of Hong Kong people in the prospects of
the city and the "One Country, Two Systems" principle, the local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
When reviewing its regular surveys conducted in 1997, the
social sciences research center under Hong Kong University
observed that 74 percent of the residents are confident about Hong
Kong's future this year, higher than 56 percent for 1994, 58
percent for 1995 and 63 percent for 1996.
</P>
<P>
It was notable that the confidence level edged up from 72
percent in the first half of 1997 to record-high 77 percent in the
second half when the Special Administrative Region (SAR) took
shape.
</P>
<P>
People's sentiment toward the "One Country, Two System" concept
has also turned bullish. In the year 1997 record-high 61 percent
of the respondents voiced confidence in the concept, compared with
between 35 percent and 45 percent recorded for each of the
previous three years.
</P>
<P>
Sixty five percent of people are confident about "One country,
Two Systems" after the handover, up from 57 percent in the first
half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a high percentage of local residents expressed their
belief in the SAR government headed by Chief Executive Tung Chee
Hwa.

</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The financial collpase of South Korea has not finished yet.
Despite the aid from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the
reforms announced by the government, the stock exchange in Seoul
fell by 7.5 percent on Tuesday and the currency won dropped by 15
percent to 2000 wons for one U.S. dollar in a generalized climate of
panic.
</P>
<P>
-- With the nearing of the month of Ramadan, killings have been
increasing in Algeria. At least 19 people were killed Sunday and
Monday around the capital Algiers, according to Algerian press
reports. Algerians are afraid that the approach of the fasting month
would bring a repetition of the massacres which marked the season
last year and in previous years.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- South Korea, the 11th largest economy in the world, is in
suspension of payments, with its national currency and the stock
exchange in Seoul in a free falling, losing 13 percent and 7.5
percent of their values respectively within one day on Tuesday. The
Deputy Finance Minister Kang Man-soo provoked a wave of panic by
recognizing that the total debt of the country is 200 billion U.S.
dollars, nearly double the 119.7 billion dollars as was officially
declared until now.
</P>
<P>
-- This is a very good year for buyings at Christmas. Big stores
and commercial centers of France so far have already registered a
5-10 percent rise in sellings as compared with last year. Big shops

<HEADLINE> China Able to Mass Propagate Rainbow Trout Fries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists in the
Aquatic Products Administration of Qinghai Province, northwest
China, has succeeded in mass propagating rainbow trout fries after
eight years of painstaking efforts.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the survival rate of rainbow trout
fries in the Aquatic Products Administration has reached 85.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
China started breeding rainbow trouts in the late 1980s in
Qinghai and Gansu provinces, both of which have a vast area
of cold water. However, the survival rate was very low.
</P>
<P>
Beginning from 1990, Qinghai Province, taking the opportunity
of implementing a UN-aided fishery development project,
organized scientists and technicians to carry out researches on
mass propagation of rainbow trout fries. They have increased the
survival rate by adjusting the fodder, among other measures.
</P>
<P>
The propagation center of rainbow trout fries at the Nanmen
Gorge in Qinghai has bred 1.1 million head of baby rainbow trouts
this year, with an average weight of one gram per head, said a
local experts.
</P>
<P>
Now, Qinghai can mass propagate rainbow trout fries since it
has built several industrialized propagation centers and
fodder-processing plants.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. World Food Program
(WFP) said today it has begun Christmas airdrops of urgently
needed food to hundreds of thousands of people in Kenya,
including Somali refugees, cut off by floods in the remote
northeastern areas.
</P>
<P>
The organization will airdrop 1,500 tons of maize and high
energy biscuits to more than 200,000 people in Maudera, Garissa,
Wajir and Garsen, according to a WFP news release reaching here.
</P>
<P>
In part of these areas, people have been marooned for up to
seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
WFP is also using boats to reach people stranded along the
Tana River.
</P>
<P>
"This combination of airdrops, airlifts and boats has given
the operation a massive boost, enabling us to deliver a total of
60 tons of relief cargo each day, assisting 12,000 people on half
rations for one month," said David Fletcher, acting WFP country
director for Kenya.
</P>
<P>
" By delivering food to those living in far flung areas, we
are not only providing assistance to meet basic needs but
preventing huge population movements to the food distribution
points, which could create further health hazards and food
difficulties," he noted.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that if the rain halt immediately, it will
take up until February to reopen road services in the region
where estimatedly 300,000 people have suffered from heavy rains
caused by the El Nino weather pattern.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Disburses $60 Million to Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has disbursed
one billion Zimbabwe Dollars (60 million U.S. dollars) in the
second structural adjustment credit facility to Zimbabwe,
Zimbabwe's Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa announced here on
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
It is a demonstration of the bank's satisfaction with the way
the government has tackled budgetary imbalances brought about by
the need to pay pensions and gratuities for former freedom
fighters, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank suspended the balance of payments support for
Zimbabwe three months ago after the government bowed to
pressure from restive former guerillas and agreed to them over an
estimated four billion Zimbabwe Dollars (235 million U.S.
dollars) in gratuities and pensions.
</P>
<P>
The money had not been budgeted for and there is fear from
the donor community, local businesses and economists that the
proposed payments to the former fighters would put the country's
national budget targets off course and trigger uncertainty in the
economy.
</P>
<P>
Other multilateral donor institutions had followed the steps of
the World Bank and withheld crucial support to Zimbabwe pending
the outcome of the government's financial plans to fund the war
veterans gratuity payments.

<HEADLINE> Scenic Wuyi Mountains Benefit City Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Nanping City, where the scenic
Wuyi Mountains are located, is expected to earn 640 million yuan
(77.108 million US dollars) from tourism this year, up 72.5
percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
The city in northern Fujian Province is expected to receive
105,000 overseas tourists who will spend an estimated 11.55
million US dollars in Nanping this year, an increase of 43.8
percent and 58.2 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
New highways, the new Wuyishan Airport and a railway leading to
the Wuyi Mountains this year have helped propel the city's
tourism industry, said Mayor Li Chuan.
</P>
<P>
Seeing the bright prospects for tourism, the city has already
designated tourism as a pillar industry and will concentrate
efforts on improving travel routes leading to the Wuyi Mountains.
</P>
<P>
As part of the effort, a Hongkong investor recently opened a
tourism entertainment company which has decided to inject over 200
million yuan in the first phase of development in the scenic
Jiufeng Mountains and the Guyuezhou Island around the Yanping
Lake, which is the largest man-made lake in Fujian.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Angolan Peace Process: Hope Still Around </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Angola's peace process has
been stranded in a deadlock for several months, after a major
breakthrough in early 1997. Hope, however, is still around for
peace-thirsty Angolan people.
</P>
<P>
Following the formation of a united national army at the end
of 1996, the peace process entered into a political solution
stage in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The first progress made in this stage was the government's
recognition of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola) leader Jonas Savimbi as the leader of the largest
opposition party, after 15 months of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
On April 9, 66 deputies of parliament of the UNITA were sworn
into the national assembly, which was formed after Angola's first
multi-party election in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Two days later, a national unity and reconciliation
government, including four ministers and seven deputy ministers
from the UNITA was inaugurated.
</P>
<P>
The formation of this government marks a major step in
national reconciliation and the beginning of nation
reconstruction in Angola after two decades of civil war.
</P>
<P>
The peace process, however, hit snags when it came to
rebuilding government administration into UNITA-occupied areas, a
key item of the 1994 Lusaka peace accord signed by UNITA and the
Angolan government.
</P>
<P>
It seems that UNITA is reluctant to give up power in areas
under its control, especially areas of strategic importance.
</P>
<P>
In more than one cases, its members and supporters were
reportedly involved in skirmishes disrupting local government
inaugurations. They refused to recognize the leadership of local
governments and even went to the point of tearing up national
flags.
</P>
<P>
UNITA's uncooperation has actually put the peace process to a
halt. It was at this point that the United Nations (U.N.)
Security Council decided to impose sanctions on it in August,
with a view to bringing it back to the peace track.
</P>
<P>
U.N.'s sanctions include the closure of UNITA representative
offices overseas and a ban on its officials from overseas
travels.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. demands that UNITA completely disarm its personnel,
transform its radio into an independent commercial one and
cooperate in rebuilding local governments.
</P>
<P>
UNITA did take some measures under international pressure, but
these steps are definitely not enough to save the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In the latest development, the government last Thursday issued
an ultimatum to the UNITA urging it to observe all the
regulations under the Lusaka peace process by January 22 next
year.
</P>
<P>
While it is doubtful if the ultimatum could force the UNITA
back to the peace process, as it was in the case of the U.N.
sanctions, observers, however, believe that hope is still alive
for the peace process to step out of the current deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Both the government and the UNITA have repeatedly confirmed
their commitment to continuing the peace process. What is more
important, both sides have realized that they could not afford
going into another war as that war will never solve their
problem.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the two sides have agreed to hold a summit meeting
between President Dos Santos and UNITA leader Savimbi to iron out
issues facing them.
</P>
<P>
Final peace and unity in Angola is now around the corner if
only both sides show more political courage supported with
actions.

<HEADLINE> Chissano Hails Positive Trend in Solving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano has expressed satisfaction over some progress which has
been made recently in solving African conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Speaking here Tuesday while receiving the New Year greetings
from foreign missions based in the Mozambican capital, Chissano
said the end of tension in the Great Lakes region is a positive
trend toward the elimination of conflict centers in the African
continent.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the positive results from the Somali peace talks
ended in Cairo on Monday, Chissano urged various Somali clans to
continue seek solutions through negotiations in a bid to make the
long-awaited peace, Noticias reported today.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the genocide incident on the borders of Rwanda
and the Democratic Republic of Congo, as well as the manslaughter
in Sierra Leone and the Comoros, the Mozambican president uttered
his condemnation, saying that "at a time when the consolidation
of democracy is becoming a global factor, and peace and order, it
is unacceptable for someone to still use arms as a means to grasp
power."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chissano also appealed for international support
for the implementation of sanctions imposed on Angola, so as to
make active contribution to "putting an end to the Angola Peace
Process."

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- More and more tourists and

3.3-km-long underground river, which is believed to be the longest
boating cave river in the world.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Swimming Rebounds from Atlanta Doldrums (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- With the Atlanta Olympic Games
fadding farther behind and the World Championships drawing closer,
1997 looks like a quiet year for swimming.
</P>
<P>
Quiet if there had been no Chinese Eighth National Games.
</P>
<P>
Chinese women swimmers, who won only one gold in Atlanta, shook
off shadow of the lackluster show by setting two world records,
nine Asian marks and 11 world year's best times in the Games in
Shanghai last October.
</P>
<P>
The sensational performance reminded sports world that China,
whose women won 12 out of 16 golds at the Rome World Championships
in 1994 and glittered with four golds in Barcelona Olympic Games,
re-emerged as one of the powerhouses in the world.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yan from northeast China's Liaoning Province became the
most prolific star in the National Games by bagging four
individual gold medals plus two world records.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old excited herself and the fans in the women's 400
meters individual medley by clocking four minutes and 34.79
seconds, shattering the 15-year-old mark of 4:36.10 set by Petra
Schneider of former East Germany on August 1, 1982.
</P>
<P>
And only two days later, Chen savored her second feat by
clocking 2:11.27 to surpass another world record of 2:11.65 in the
200m individual medley, which was eventually won by Wu Yanyan of
Guangxi.
</P>
<P>
Wu, 19, became the surprise heroine in the event with 2:09.72,
beating Chen into second place and putting her own name in the
world record book.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who stands 1.78 meters and is believed a born swimmer,
also triumphed in the 200m, 400m and 800m freestyle events,
declaring the beginning of her era.
</P>
<P>
Chen's road to the top was checkered with ups and downs when
she caught the spotlight in the Olympic trials with four golds but
ended with fiasco in Atlanta after failing to make any of the
finals in three events.
</P>
<P>
The strong comeback in the National Games helped her restore
confidence and she is ready to make another storm in the world
arena.
</P>
<P>
"I sincerely hope that I can do better in the coming World
Swimming Championships in Perth next January," she said.
</P>
<P>
For Wu, who also shone in the Olympic trials but slipped into
slump in Atlanta, the world record was a juicy fruit of 12-year
hard training.
</P>
<P>
"She has swum 3,000 kilometers in the pool this year," coach Wu
Jicai said of his protege.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Swimming Rebounds from Atlanta Doldrums (2-last) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joining hands with youngsters to drag China out of the doldrums
was Le Jingyi, the lone swimming champion for China in Atlanta and
world record holder of 50m and 100m freestyles.
</P>
<P>
Le, who was named the outstanding swimmer at the Rome World
Championships for setting those two records, won the 100m
freestyle with 54.02 in the National Games -- just nine hundredths
of a second outside her world mark.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old disputed rumors that she could retire after the
Games. "I have not thought of the issue. I might take part in the
Sydney Olympic Games."
</P>
<P>
But people doubted whether she can hold her post in Sydney
after she lost her 50m speciality to a 19-year-old Shan Ying and
failed to make the 200m freestyle finals.
</P>
<P>
In evaluating the performance of the women swimmers in the
Games, Chinese sports officials warned both the young and veterans
against pre-mature conceit and the tough challenge ahead in the
world.
</P>
<P>
"They can hardly peak again in just three months, and I don't
expect them to put up very good results in the world
championships," said Yuan Jiawei, general secretary of the Chinese
Swimming Association.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Weimin, vice minister of the Chinese Physical Culture and
Sports Commission, also slapped at the near-sightedness of
provincial sports officials, who urged their athletes to peak in
the national events instead of encouraging them to reserve the
best for big meetings.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese athletes should compete in top form in international
and world events instead of focusing on internal strife," he said.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the pool, the passing year also saw the Chinese
shine sporadically in the low-profile World Short-Course
Championships in Gothenburg and the World Cup short-course
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
In the World Short-Course Championships in April, the Chinese
foursome, composed of Wang Luna, Chen Yan, Nian Yun and Shan Ying,
broke the world 4X200m freestyle relay record by clocking 7:51.92.
</P>
<P>
While the women stole the limelight in the year from short to
long courses, their men counterparts also tried hard not to be
overlooked.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Chengji proved he was still the best man swimmer of China
by winning three individual gold medals. His time in the 50m
freestyle and 100m butterfly were ranked sixth and eighth
respectively this year in the world.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Qiliang also swam the year's third best time in the 100m
breaststroke, a great stride following his record seventh
finishing at the Atlanta Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Ming, deputy head coach of the national team, said that
through hard efforts of several generations, it was only a matter
of time for the Chinese men swimmers to bring back Olympic or
world titles.
</P>
<P>
"They are no longer satisfied with national or Asian gold
medals," Zhou said. "They are eager to win titles at world major
tournaments."

<P>
NAIROBI, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Top medical experts have
flown to Kenya's Northeastern Province to investigate the
mysterious disease which claimed over 160 lives in the last four
days, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
A urgent response medical team has arrived in the province,
which comprises experts from the Kenya's Ministry of Health,
World Health Organization, Kenya Medical Research Institute and
Africa Medical Research Fund.
</P>
<P>
Local press quoted James Mwanzia, Director of Medical
Services, as saying Tuesday that the experts listed 12 possible
diseases including yellow and Rift Valley fevers, Marburg fever
and severe malaria.
</P>
<P>
The symptoms of the disease are diarrhoea, high fever and
bleeding from the mouth and nose.
</P>
<P>
Mwanzia said that the disease which is said to kill people
within 36 hours could be a mix of malaria and dysentery because
of the flooding caused by the El Nino weather phenomenon and the
warm spell which followed.
</P>
<P>
He said that relevant specimens would be flown to Nairobi on
daily basis for analysis.

<HEADLINE> Iran Confirms Stopping Russian Aid Plane to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran today confirmed it has
stopped a Russian aid plane carrying a Russian team of parliament
members (MPs) and businessmen to Iraq by defying the U.N.
sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Russian aircraft, which was scheduled to land in Iraq
today, was currently held up with a delegation of 20 people at
Iran's western city of Kermanshah near Iraqi border.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Foreign Ministry said in an announcement last night
the Russian Tupolev-204 plane was carrying medicine for Iraqi
children.
</P>
<P>
Iran has asked for U.N. authorization to send the shipment of
Russian humanitarian aid to Iraq though a land route and Iranian
officials in Kermanshah were prepared to do so.
</P>
<P>
"Sending the cargo through air would only be possible through
special U.N. authorization," the source noted, adding that "it is
natural that Iran continues to abide by U.N. sanctions regulations
on Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Iran News quoted an unnamed "analyst" as saying
that "Iran attaches paramount importance to international laws and
norms and was unable to let the Russian plane fly into Iraq
without authorization" from the U.N..
</P>
<P>
"We all know that the United Nations has imposed sanctions on
Iraq because of Baghdad's invasion of its tiny neighbor Kuwait in
1990, on the basis of U.N. sanctions, no plane can fly into Iraq
except those of U.N. carrying food and medicine," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iran rejected Baghdad's accusation that it was preventing the
Russian aircraft to fly to Iraq, saying that Baghdad "is
distorting the facts on Iran."
</P>
<P>
A Russia official was quoted as saying that negotiations were
in progress with the Iranian authorities over the issue, hoping a
solution to be found in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry said this issue would be solved soon since
"it is a humanitarian flight and not commercial and it does not
break the international embargo."
</P>
<P>
According to the Iraqi side, the flight of Russian Tupolev-204
was an initiative of Russian ultra-nationalist MP Vladimir
Zhirinovsky who heads the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and has
strongly criticized the sanctions imposed on Iraq following its
1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The plane was chartered by the LDP and carrying 20 LDP
representatives in the State Duma (lower house of the parliament)
and specialists along with aid supplies.
</P>
<P>
It was attempting to sidestep the U.N. ban on flights to and
from Iraq by asking for approval from Azerbaijan and Iran through
which it would pass instead of U.N. authorization.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 24 (Xinhua) -- For the first time Shanghai
has permitted foreign companies to invest in its public transport
sector, with a joint Shanghai-Singapore bus venture established
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai-Singapore Bus Corporation Ltd., with a registered
capital of 100 million yuan, will run 15 bus lines in the urban
area. The lines have been leased to the company for 25 years, and so
have been the 40 stations and offices along the lines.
</P>
<P>
The company has decided to speed up the replacement of old
buses with new ones, so that new buses will account for more than
60 percent of the total within three years.
</P>
<P>
This practice has changed the city's single state ownership in
the public transport sector, experts say, and has provided a new
approach to the growth of the state-owned bus companies.

create a situation which will be a pretext for the breakdown of
talks," Chongo said.

Police spokesman Beenwell Chimfwembe declined to make public
the reason for the detention.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Re-Proposes VAT Refunds for Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Foreign tourists could expect
to get value-added tax (VAT) back for the goods they buy in
Thailand next year as the Thai Finance Ministry is re-proposing a
VAT refund program.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Post Wednesday said that the revenue department
under the ministry had agreed in principle to the refund program,
which is expected to be forwarded to the cabinet for approval
soon.
</P>
<P>
If the plan won the cabinet approval, it will be implemented
beginning on the new year, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, foreign tourists who buy goods at a designated
outlet may receive the VAT refund on the day they depart Thailand,
according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Yet, foreign tourists have to pay the traditional one percent
fee on the value of the goods, it added.
</P>
<P>
The refund proposal emerged years ago to make Thailand an
international shopping hub to match Hong Kong and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
However, the idea has been floating for years as the Thai
government was reluctant to provide the refunds.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Finance Minister Pichet Phanvichartkul recently
said that if the proposal is adopted this time, the government
will be responsible for the refunds initially and then it may
transfer the responsibility to private firms.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Argentina is setting up a
special police unit with powers to deal with the nation's
worsening soccer violence after a fan's death at a first division
match, officials said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ulises Fernandez, a 24-year-old fan of Huracan was shot dead in
the head last Friday at a local derby against San Lorenzo when
fans pelting each other with stones outside the stadium.
</P>
<P>
Argentine Football Association chief Julio Grondona said at a
meeting of security and soccer authorities that a decree would be
passed to enanble the government's Security Department the direct
responsibility to deal with soccer violence.
</P>
<P>
A database of known hooligans would also be set up to
effectively trace the crime records of those soccer violence
criminals, said Grondona.
</P>
<P>
Security Secretary Adrian Pelacchi said the death of Fernandez
had nothing to do with the decision to rush through the
long-stalled Sports Violence Law as they were "not waiting for a
fan's death to speed up the signiture of the decree".
</P>
<P>
Under the law, Pelacchi will have powers to order the temporary
or permanernt closure of grounds with repeated problems with
violence.

<HEADLINE> Passengers Held Partly Responsible for Air Flight Delays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 24 (Xinhua) -- As high as 5,100 air flight
delays occurred this year were caused by passengers, according to
a national meeting held here.
</P>
<P>
The punctuality of passenger planes in China in the first 11 months
of this year was only 74 percent, lower than last year, the
meeting held by Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting said some of the passengers missed the descending
time due to shopping and dozing off; others were unable to catch
plane on time due to being unable to present right documentation
or hiding hazardous goods in luggages.
</P>
<P>
In a serious case on December 7, a flight running between
Shanghai and Dalian was delayed two hours and 47 minutes merely
because of a joke made by an irresponsible passenger who claimed
he had a bomb in his suitcase when being ordered to move the
suitcase from the aisle. He was later detained for 15 days.
</P>
<P>
"We sincerely hope passengers show more concern and support to
our work," said a CAAC official.

BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- China has to readjust its
economic structure to maintain healthy development, a high
ranking official from the State Planning Commission has said.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Yanpei, vice-minister in charge of the commission, said in
an article carried by today's People's Daily that the country has
in the last years raised its overall economic strength mainly by
increasing investment and building new projects.
</P>
<P>
During the forthcoming economic restructuring, attention will
be paid on improving economic quality and increasing efficiency,
he said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, China has made great achievements in economic
restructuring by developing backbone industries and creating new

added.
</P>
<P>
To speed up the progress, he called for efforts on developing
new industries and high-tech industries, such as the electronic
information industry.
</P>
<P>
According to him, electronic firms should be encouraged to set
up large conglomerates which are more competent on the
international market.
</P>
<P>
Housing construction for urban and rural residents should be
accelerated and the ongoing housing reform be further carried out,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The equipment of the State-owned enterprises should be
modernized to bring the overall economy to a new high level, added
Zeng.
</P>
<P>
The official also called on enlarging rural market for
household electrical appliances and manufacturing more equipment
for the industrialization of agriculture.

NEW DELHI, December 24 (Xinhua) -- India's business leaders
suggested that demand should be stimulated through the
government's public expenditure on development activities,
specially infrastructure, said a survey here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the Federation of Indian Chamber of
Commerce and Industry covering 303 corporations in the medium,
large and small sectors, has revealed that corporations are in the
throes of major slowdown.
</P>
<P>
In fact, 50 percent of the respondents felt "if the trend is
not corrected, the economy would slip into a recessionary phase."
</P>
<P>
Forty-five percent of the respondents were of the view that the
current slowdown would continue for more than a year and 30
percent felt that the slowdown would remain in effect for another
nine to 12 months, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
The survey revealed that lack of demand and overcapacity have
been a major deterrent factor affecting the growth. The recent
political instability also had a dampening effect on investments.

<HEADLINE> Second Accused of Oklahoma Bombing Convicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- A federal jury Tuesday
convicted Terry Nichols, one of the two men charged with the
Oklahoma city bombing, of conspiracy to use a weapon of mass
destruction and involuntary manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
The convictions mean the jurors did not believe Nichols carried
out premeditated murder but acknowledge that the eight federal
officers were killed as a result of Nichols' action.
</P>
<P>
But the seven-women and five-men jury in Denver, Colorado,
acquitted Nichols of two other counts -- using a weapon of mass
destruction and destroying the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building
in Oklahoma, the bombing of which left 168 dead and 500 injured on
April 19, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said they accept the verdict and are ready to move
on to the penalty phase.
</P>
<P>
Nichols, 42, frowned as he listened to the jury's decision,
news reports said. He would possibly face a death sentence.
</P>
<P>
The other suspect in the bombing, Nichols' former Army buddy
Timothy McVeigh, was convicted and sentenced to death earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
United States District Judge Richard Matsch ordered the jury
back to the U.S. Courthouse in Denver next Monday to begin the
sentencing phase of Nichols.
</P>
<P>
Matsch scheduled a Wednesday hearing on a defense motion to
overturn the verdict.
</P>
<P>
In June, another jury took 23 hours to convict McVeigh on all
11 counts and sentenced him to die after 11 hours of
deliberations. McVeigh is at the federal prison in Florence,
Colorado, and his case is on appeal.

<HEADLINE> Thai Government Stands Firm to Cancel Hopewell Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The Chuan Leekpai government
has reaffirmed the Thai government's stand to scrap the Hopewell
elevated rail and road project contract.
</P>
<P>
The Chuan cabinet at its weekly meeting on Tuesday confirmed
that it will stick to the previous government's decision to cancel
the contract.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Transport and Communications Ministry will send an
official letter to inform Hopewell (Thailand) Co. of the
government's stand within the week.
</P>
<P>
The Chuan cabinet had agreed with the ministry to seek an order
from the civil court to scrap the project to save time and ensure
the right to use the site, as Hopewell might resort to
time-consuming arbitration to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
The Chavalit Yongchaiyudh government made a decision in
September this year to revoke the Hopewell contract, citing the
delay in construction over the past six years.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that so far, only a fifth of the 60 km
multi-deck system was completed, with the cost estimated at 3.7
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government will seek other private parties to take
over the project, the newspapers said.

<HEADLINE> Red Tape Hampers Rehabilitation in Northern Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Bureaucratic red tape of the
Sri Lankan government departments has resulted in delays in
proposed rehabilitation, reconstruction and resettlement projects
in the Jaffna peninsula, informed sources said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Authority for North
(RRAN), which functions under the direction of President Chandrika
Kumaratunga, and international humanitarian relief agencies in Sri
Lanka have experienced certain difficulties in implementing Jaffna
projects, the sources pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The RRAN and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) have
made arrangements to implement 11 of the 34 proposed projects,
funded by the UNDP, from the beginning of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Despite a series of discussions officials have not approved the
projects. The sources said: "Every time we met they wanted to make
amendments to the projects."
</P>
<P>
Many officials responsible for approving and monitoring ongoing
or proposed projects in Jaffna have not visited that region in the
recent two years, said the sources, who asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
"Here we have foreign donors willing to fund projects but
bureaucratic red tape has caused serious problems. Decisions are
made by people who have not visited Jaffna for the past two
years," they said.
</P>
<P>
They noted that people in Jaffna expect the government to
improve their living conditions as soon as possible.
Meanwhile, even though the UNDP had agreed to fund the Jaffna
mine clearing project, the green light has not been given to
launch the project.
</P>
<P>
The sources stressed that the government's military operations
against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in the peninsula must
be supported by intensified efforts to improve civil
administration and facilities in the region.

<HEADLINE> IMF, World Bank Approve Debt Reduction Package for Guyana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and the World Bank today announced an agreement to
support a debt reduction package for Guyana under the initiative
for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HPIC).
</P>
<P>
The total assistance to be provided to Guyana by all of its
external creditors will reduce Guyana's external debt burden by a
quarter, about 253 million U.S. dollars in Net Present Value (NPV)
terms.
</P>
<P>
This is estimated to translate into debt-service relief over
time of close to 500 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The IMF and World Bank will provide assistance with a NPV value
of 35 million dollars and 27 million dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
In recognition of Guyana's exceptional achievements in
implementing reform it was agreed that the completion point for
the delivery of the debt reduction package will be one year from
now, to December 1998. This is two-years shorter than the normal
three-year waiting period under the HIPC initiative.
</P>
<P>
However, the delivery of the debt reduction package from the
IMF and the World Bank is subject to confirmation from Guyana's
other creditors that they will provide their share and
satisfactory implementation of reforms agreed by the Government.
</P>
<P>
The IMF will provide its assistance at the completion point in
the form of a grant into an escrow account to be used to pay
debt-services falling due to the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the World Bank will use the special HIPC Trust Fund,
to which it has already contributed 750 million dollars, to
purchase debts owed by Guyana to the International Development
Association (IDA), the World Bank's concessionary lending arm to
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
These debts will then be canceled. m The fiscal resources
released will be used by the government to strengthen and broaden
its social program, especially in basic health and education.
</P>
<P>
Guyana is the fourth country to benefit under the HIPC
debt-reduction initiative, raising the total debt relief committed
under the initiative in 1997 to about 1.2 billion dollars in NPV
terms, or about two billion dollars in debt service reduction over
time.
</P>
<P>
Guyana is also the first country to qualify under criteria
established under this initiative, in April 1997, for highly open
economies with heavy fiscal burdens of external debt despite
strong efforts in mobilizing revenue.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) also
issued a statement endorsing the decision to grant debt relief for
Guyana, the second country in South America to benefit from the
HIPC initiative.
</P>
<P>
The IDB will grant debt relief to Guyana for a total of 48.1
million dollars in present value.
</P>
<P>
Bolivia, the first Western Hemisphere country to benefit from
the initiative, was awarded 155 million dollars in debt relief, in
terms of present value by the IDB last September.

<P>
WARSAW, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Poland has set up a special
group and will send representatives to Chechnya as soon as
possible in order to rescue five Poles, who were kidnapped in the
Russian breakaway region on December 17.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek said here Tuesday that the
five young men were aid volunteers, who started their Chechnya
trip on December 14 by a car, following Polish Gdanskie transport
food vehicles.
</P>
<P>
They were kidnapped by unidentified people after meeting with
former Chechen President Zelimkhan Yandarbijev on December 17.
</P>
<P>
The missing people's car was found on the way to their
destination Samaszki, a village 30 kilometers west of the region's
capital Grozny, with tires pierced by bullets.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that none of them was harmed, because there was
no bloodstain at the site.
</P>
<P>
Geremek said this is the first time that Poles were kidnapped.
So far, it has not been clear why they were kidnapped, due to
money or political aim?
</P>
<P>
There were reportedly about 200 people kidnapped in the Chechen
region, including two British. The ransom was three million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Polish Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek is worried about the case. He
said that the case involved human lives, it will be treated with
the utmost care.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Telecom Targets 300,000 New Phones by 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT)
will invest 23 billion rupees (383 million U.S. dollars) next year
in order to provide 300,000 new telephone connections in two
years, the Daily News newspaper said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The new investment would form the basis of a three-year
restructuring plan of the SLT, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive Officer of SLT Hideki Kamitsuma was quoted as
saying that their immediate task was to expedite new connections.
To achieve the target, the company has to provide at least 10,000
new connections each month.
</P>
<P>
The CEO said a total of 70,000 connections have been
established this year, compared with 20,000 connections in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Currently the company has 252 telephone exchanges with a
456,610 switching capacity throughout the country. In 1998 the
capacity will be expanded to 635,000.
</P>
<P>
The SLT also proposes to re-balance its tariff structure next
year by revising the local call charges upwards. At present local
calls are heavily subsidized at the expense of international call
charges. About 80 percent of the SLT's income came from
international call charges.
</P>
<P>
The SLT was partly privatized in August when the government
sold a 35 percent stake to the NTT of Japan for 225 million
dollars.

<P>
BUDAPEST, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Hungary's Foreign Ministry
expressed regret on Tuesday over the resignation of Romanian
Foreign Minister Adrian Severin.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Horvath Gabor spoke highly of
Severin and hoped that Romania's foreign policy would stay the
same after the top diplomat's resignation.
</P>
<P>
Severin had done a very good job, Gabor said, adding that he
had made great contributions to the normalization and development
of the relations between Hungary and Romania.
</P>
<P>
Romania has achieved great successes in foreign affairs under
Severin's leadership, and the Hungary-Romania ties have been
advancing rapidly to benefit both countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman wished broad prospects for the future bilateral
ties to serve not only Romania's participation in the European
integration process but also the two countries' interests.
</P>
<P>
Severin resigned on Tuesday over his allegations made in
September that several political leaders and newspaper editors in
his country were spies for foreign intelligence services.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian Supreme Defense Council said "no elements were
found" to support his charges. President Emil Constantinescu, who
heads the council, said the accusations were "an error" and
suggested Severin should quit.
</P>
<P>
Premier Victor Ciorbea accepted the resignation, the state news
agency Rompres reported.

debts.

although the cut contributes a little to the nation, it may give a

JINAN, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Two cubs of the Manchurian
tiger, one of the most endangered species in the world, have been
born in the zoo of Yantai, a coastal city in east China's

</P>
<P>
The cubs, one male and one female, were born on October 24
and they have since been fed artificially. Experts say, artificial
feeding is more difficult than being fed by the dam.
</P>
<P>
Their mother, 6-year-old, delivered four cubs that day, but
only two survived. The tiger has a natural first cub surviving
rate of five percent, the experts say.
</P>

the record holder in China in artifically breeding Manchurian
tigers.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia may become Southeast
Asia's biggest exporter of electronic products in 2006, a
government official said.
</P>
<P>
"The target could be achieved, however, if by 2006 Indonesia is
able to export at least 40 billion US dollars worth of such
products," Electronics Industry Director at the Directorate
General of Multifarious Industry Ardiansyah Parman said Tuesday in
Medan, North Sumatra, according to reports reaching here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ardiansyah said Indonesia's electronic exports in 2000 are
projected to earn 10 billion dollars and will grow in volume and
value by an average of 25 percent per year till 2006.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the growth rate may be difficult to achieve
if Indonesia merely relies on the domestic electronic industry.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it would be necessary for Indonesia to attract
foreign investment in the electronic industry subsector and team
up with world-class export-oriented electronic companies to
relocate their business to Indonesia, he added.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's electronic products earned 3.2 billion dollars in
foreign exchange in 1996, but still lower than that of several
other electronic producers in Southeast Asia.

TIRANA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian government said in
a statement Tuesday that it welcomes the results of the Serbian
presidential elections which it believes will improve the
Albania-Yugoslavia relations.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that as a result it was expected the
Albanian people in the Kosovo region were likely to be granted
more political rights.
</P>
<P>
Milan Milutinovic, leader of the Serbian Socialist party, was
elected the new president of the Serbian Republic on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Yugoslavia and Albania have been at a
standstill for the past 50 years. Albania is very dissatisfied
with Yugoslavia over the issue of the Albanian people in the
Kosovo region within the Serbian border.
</P>
<P>
The present Albanian government has made some efforts to
improve the relationship. According to the Albanian news agency,
ATSH, officials from the two countries held talks in Tirana this
week, and some agreements on transport cooperation will be signed
in the near future.
</P>
<P>
However, Albanian Minister of Foreign Affairs Paskal Mi Lo
disclosed at a news conference Tuesday that Albania had declined
an offer by Yugoslavia to promote their relations to ambassadorial
level. He said it was not yet the proper time to take the step.

MOSCOW, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Tajik President Emomali
Rakhmonov and the United Tajik Opposition (UTO) leader, Sayid
Abdullo Nuri, said there is no further obstacle to forming a
coalition government.
</P>
<P>
They made the remark following talks on Tuesday, the Interfax
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to form a new government with 30 percent of the
posts given to the opposition, as stipulated by a general peace
agreement earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
On June 27, 1997, the two sides signed a landmark peace accord
in Moscow, ending the central Asian coluntry's four-year civil war.

Under the agreement, opposition forces were to integrate with
government troops or lay down weapons, and a joint government was
to be formed.
</P>

independence in 1991. Islamic opposition forces, the main rivals
of the Tajik government, set up bases in mountainous border areas
between Tajikistan and Afghanistan, and launched a guerrilla war.
</P>

The peace process started in 1994 on the initiative of the
United Nations, leading to the signing of the June peace
agreement.

<HEADLINE> Armed Men Kill 43 Indigenous People in Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 23 (Xinhua) -- A group of armed men
killed at least 43 indigenous people and injured dozens of others
in a latest attack in the southeastern Mexican state of Chiapas, a
rebel army spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Javier Elorriaga of the rebel Zapatista National
Liberation Army (EZLN) said the attack occurred on Monday in the
town of Acteal, in the municipality of Chenalho.
</P>
<P>
Elorriaga blamed the manslaughter, during a local celebration
event, on paramilitary groups and said the federal government was
"guilty of not fulfilling the peace accords reached with the EZLN."
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Health Secretariat in the city of San
Cristobal de las Casas said more than 20 injured, including women
and children, were taken to a hospital in the region.
</P>
<P>
The assault was the bloodiest in Chiapas since more than 130
people died in the EZLN uprising in January 1994.
</P>
<P>
Chiapas Attorney General Marco Antonio Bezares said an official
commission was heading to the site to investigate the case, as
ordered by President Ernesto Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
"Many people have lost their lives, we condemned the action,
and the Chiapas government is concerned," the local official said.
</P>
<P>
Here in this Mexican capital city, President Zedillo told Chief
State Prosecutor Jorge Madrazo to "spare no effort in identifying
and punishing those who carried out this crime."
</P>
<P>
Violences in Chenalho broke out six months ago when the
sympathizers of the EZLN and the followers of the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party began fighting for power.

<HEADLINE> Labor Service Effective in Helping Poor Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Labor export has become one of
the most effective way for poor farmers in Gansu Province to tide
over a meagre year.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-six year-old Yang Qing and his four-member family in
Dangchang County would have been in trouble if he had not gone to
the neighboring Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, helping collect
cotton to make some money.
</P>
<P>
His village had been plagued by droughts for four successive
years. He had a poor harvest from his farmland this year. Although
the local government provided his family with relief grain, he
still could not make the ends meet.
</P>
<P>
Like other laborers, Yang left the village to earn a living for
the whole family. By now the province has exported nearly two
million of rural laborers to other provinces, autonomous regions
and municipalities, and they have earned a total of 2.1 billion
yuan (about 250 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Wang Wulin and his wife have been left alone at home in Wudu
County since their two children went out as migrant
laborers. Their son even hasn't written back telling where he is
now. But the old couple doesn't worry about their children, as
they have remitted home regularly.
</P>
<P>
After years of working outside of their home villages, an
increasing number of migrant laborers have begun to return to the
villages to make a new career out of the skills or experience they
have gained outside.
</P>
<P>
"Years ago, we had to persuade farmers to go outside to make a
living. But now they have seen the good of it and do it
voluntarily," said a local township government official.
</P>
<P>
The province has opened labor service agencies in seven
provinces, autonomous regions and cities, providing information
for laborers.

BELGRADE, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Fully developing relations
with the European Union (EU) is a long-term strategic principle
for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, its Foreign Minister,
Milan Milutionvic, said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Milutionvic made the remarks after meeting with visiting
Portugal Foreign Minister Zzaim Gama.
</P>
<P>
He said Portugal expressed its understanding and support for
Yugoslavia's goal in the meeting.
</P>

latter's return soon to the Organization of Security and
Cooperation of Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
Gama also met Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and Prime
Minister Radoje Kontic Tuesday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bank of Italy Cuts Discount Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Italy today cut its
official discount rate by 0.75 percent, from 6.25 to 5.50 percent.
</P>
<P>
The central bank also cut its short-term advance rate by the
same amount, from 7.75 to 7.00 percent.
</P>
<P>
The rate cut, urged by Italian businessmen and politicians,
was widely expected following the approval of a 1998 budget
earlier today.
</P>
<P>
The budget is aimed at bringing Italy's deficit below the 3
percent ratio required to join the European single currency.
</P>
<P>
Pressure has also mounted in recent weeks as the rates on the
central bank's own repurchase operations have been consistently
below the official discount rate.
</P>
<P>
Today's rate cut was the first of its kind since June 30, when
the Bank of Italy snipped half a point off the discount rate to
take it from 6.75 to 6.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
On January 22 1997, the bank cut the rate by 0.75 to 6.75
percent.
</P>
<P>
December's 1.5 percent inflation rate was the lowest since
February 1969, except for the 1.4 percent in June and September
this year.
</P>
<P>
Italy's annual inflation rate averages at 1.7 to 1.8
percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 24 (Xinhua) -- A title bout between
Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis to crown an unified heavyweight
champion ran into a money snag on Tuesday as guarantees demanded
by the fighters were too high.
</P>
<P>
HBO matchmaker Lou DibBella said that there was "a big gap "
over how much money it would take to make the fight in the talks
with Holyfield's promoter Don King, and his lawyer, Jim Thomas.
</P>
<P>
They had previously met Monday at a midtown hotel after Lewis's
camp in London and said the fighters had agreed in principle to
fight in April.
</P>
<P>
DiBella would not comment on specifics of the purse but said
the number would double that of Holyfield-Moorer match last month
from which Holyfield made 20 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Lewis's manager Frank Maloney said on Monday the unification
fight between Britain's World Boxing Council champion Lewis and
Holyfield would carry a purse of between 40-50 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Both fighters have long expected to meet to determine one true
heavyweight champion and it would be the first time the three
heavyweight belts have been united since Riddick Bowe held them
all in 1992 after beating Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
World Boxing Association and International Boxing Federation
champion Holyfield's record is 35-3 and Lewis 32-1.

TIANJIN, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Twelve-year-old girl Qian Xi,
weighing over 84.5 kg, came to the Tianjin Children's Hospital
today to apply for the city's first winter camp for obese children.
</P>
<P>
The five-day camp, sponsored by the Tianjin Municipal Women's
Federation, will be held in the coming winter vacation. More than
100 obese children will receive the instructions on diet and
physical exercises from experts.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yao, director of the Tianjin Children's Hospital, said
that they have developed some effective methods to rapidly reduce
the weight of the children through proper diet and physical
exercises.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, we want the children to cultivate healthy habits,
which will have a long-term effect on their future life," said
Wang.
</P>
<P>
With the improvement of the living conditions, more and more
Chinese children are as fat as Qian Xi. This can be attributed to
excessive eating and drinking and lack of physical exercises.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that Chinese children intake too much fat and
sugar, and sit in front of the TV all day long while having little
physical exercises.
</P>
<P>
The number of the obese children aged between seven and
fourteen in Tianjin has exceeded 3,000.

</P>
<P>
The provincial government plans to raise the proportion of
private industrial output value to 15 percent of the province's
total, and increase the number of private industrial and
commercial enterprises to 30,000 by the end of the century,
according to Yang Yongshan, an official with Shaanxi Provincial

</P>
<P>
The provincial government also intends to develop large private

Yang said.
</P>
<P>
To speed the process along, local officials are being asked to
refrain from discriminating against private enterprises and
individual industrial and commercial households, as has been done
in the past, and to try harder to provide better service to them,
he added.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, the inland province witnessed great
progress in the development of its private economy. By the end of

PANAMA CITY, December 23 (Xinhua) -- A Panamanian legislator
said today that the people ought to be completely informed of the
future role and nature of the projected Multilateral Anti-Drug
Center (MADC) between Panama and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Aleman Boyd, President of the Legislative Commission on Drugs,
demanded that the ruling Democratic Revolutionary Party (DRP) make
clear what kind of operations would be carried out by the MADC.
</P>
<P>
The lawmaker's remarks came as a meeting took place on the
issue in Miami between Panama's negotiator Jorge Ritter and his
U.S. counterpart Thomas McNamara.
</P>
<P>
Aleman Boyd said that the decision on whether to set up the
center must be made by the people through a referendum.
</P>
<P>
The MADC will be established at the U.S. Howard Air Base,
located at the riversides of the Panama Canal and will count on
military personnel to operate the technical equipment.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the countries that have been interested in joining
the center are Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, the United States and
Panama.
</P>
<P>
The MADC project was sharply criticized by opposition parties
in Panama. They argued that the facility will mean an extension
of the U.S. military domain in the region, beyond the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The United States is supposed to retreat its troops from the
Panama Canal facilities by December 31, 1999 according to
Torrijos-Carter Treaties signed in 1977 by Panama and the United
States.

<HEADLINE> O'Neal to Miss Another Two Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Los Angeles Lakers center
Shaquille O'Neal will miss at least two more weeks due to a
hairline fracture in his right wrist, according to a published
report on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
O'Neal, who has already missed five weeks with a strained
abdominal muscle, suffered his latest injury about two weeks ago
when he was punching a heavy bag, the Los Angeles Times reported.
</P>
<P>
The fracture was apparently revealed Monday after O'Neal had
X-rays and a CAT scan taken on the wrist.
</P>
<P>
O'Neal has missed 17 games because of the abdominal injury,
during which period the Lakers have posted an 11-6 record. The
Lakers went 4-1 on a recent road trip which concluded with a 94-83
win Monday over the Houston Rockets.
</P>
<P>
After four seasons with the Orlando Magic, O'Neal signed a
seven-year, 121 million U.S. dollars free-agent deal with the
Lakers in the summer of 1996. He averaged 26.2 points and 12.6
rebounds in 51 games last season, sitting out 31 games with
various ailments, including ligament damage in his left knee.

<HEADLINE> Rabbani Calls for Negotiated Settlement of Afghan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Ousted Afghan president
Burhanuddin Rabbani on Tuesday called for a peaceful settlement of
the Afghan issue "through negotiations," according to a report by
the Associated Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Talking to the local media at the Peshawar Airport in North
West Frontier province soon after his arrival from Afghanistan,
Rabbani said that "this is my tacit opinion that no issue could be
solved through war because it is known to every body that the only
way to the solution of Afghan problem is possible through
negotiations."
</P>
<P>
In reply to a question about his talks with the Taliban, he
said that "we think that talks with Taliban is the only way for
restoration of peace in Afghanistan."
</P>
<P>
He appreciated efforts of the Pakistani government for
restoration of peace in Afghanistan and said, "we have come here
to discuss the Afghan problem so as to achieve peace in our
country."
</P>
<P>
He also said "we hope, Pakistan and Iran, our neighboring
countries who along with Saudi Arabia helped us during Jehad (Holy
War) against the former Soviet Union, could play a vital role in
the settlement of the Afghan crises."
</P>
<P>
Rabbani said that "let us forget the past and work hand in hand
for the solution of the issue and resolve the tragedy."
</P>
<P>
Rabbani noted that he had held talks with Pakistani Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif in Tehran during the recent Eighth Summit of
the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) and had pleaded that
Pakistan, Iran and Saudi Arabia should come forward and initiate a
peace process in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the purpose of his current visit to Pakistan,
Rabbani said he had come here with a purpose to pave the way for a
peaceful solution of the Afghan problem.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani categorically said, "we are opposed to interference
from any foreign quarter in the internal affairs of Afghanistan,"
adding that "we think and all sides should think that there is no
way for solving the Afghan problem through war."
</P>
<P>
He further suggested that Pakistan, Iran and Saudi Arabia
should intensify efforts for peace within the framework of OIC and
under the auspices of UN.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Approves Three Billion U.S. Dollar Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved
today three billion U.S. dollar loan to help South Korea's
economic reconstruction, the first of several measures to back the
country to recover from financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The loan, with a term of 10 years of repayment and aimed at
achieving long-term stabilization and a revival of growth, is a
single-tranche fast-disbursing operation.
</P>
<P>
The resources will be utilized to focus on reforms in the
financial sector and capital markets, improvements of corporate
governance and competitiveness policies.
</P>
<P>
"We regard this loan as a symbol of Korea's commitment to
structural reforms that in time will help restore the health of a
fundamentally sound economy," James D. Wolfensohn, the President
of the World Bank said today. "Our long-term view of Korea's
economic prospects remains strongly favorable. We look forward to
working closely with the Government to help move the country
forward."
</P>
<P>
The World Bank's loan is part of a record 57 billion dollar
bailout package for South Korea. But the cash disbursement needed
quickly to satisfy short-term creditors who are demanding 15
billion dollars from South Korea by the end of the year. An
additional 1 billion dollars in short-term loans is due in
January, 1998.
</P>
<P>
South korea began borrowing from the World Bank in 1962, and
was "graduated" from its borrowing program at the end of 1994. The
loan represents a resumption of the World Bank's lending to the
country.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. U-2 spy planes will
continue to take their surveillance flights over Iraq during the
Muslim holy month of Ramadan which begins next week, the
Pentagon said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
There would be "some overflights and presumably some (U.N.
weapons) inspection trips after Ramadan begins," spokesman
Kenneth Bacon told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Bacon said the U-2 flights have been continuing and the
latest one took place "one day or two ago", which lasted four
hours. "It did what it was supposed to do and came back. It was
unchallenged," he added.
</P>
<P>
Bacon said Iraq's forces "still appear to be organizing their
SA-2 long-range missiles in a way that would position them to
perhaps be able to shoot down a U-2 flying over central Iraq."
</P>
<P>
"But we have seen no attempts to do that and, indeed, the
threatening rhetoric that they used back in early November has
ceased," he added.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has accused the United States of using the U-2 planes to
gather information for another attack against it.
</P>
<P>
Bacon said Iraq also was moving around other missile systems
and air defense units are appearing "as if they're trying to set
up ambushes for the planes flying over southern Iraq."
</P>
<P>
But again he said "there have been no threats or attempts to
ambush any of these fighters recently" from the Iraq forces.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Mediator to Travel to Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S Middle East Mediator
Dennis Ross will visit Israel and the Palestinian Authority early
next month in preparation for their leaders' separate talks with
President Bill Clinton, the State Department said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Foley told reporters that Ross
was likely to arrive in the region on Jan. 5, although details
were still being worked out.
</P>
<P>
But he said his talks with both Israeli and Palestinian
officials will focus mainly on several interim issues which have
been pending since the last Israeli-Palestinian peace deal in
1995.
</P>
<P>
These include a seaport and a corridor to connect Gaza with the
West Bank the Palestinian Authority controls, setting up an
industrial zone in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Ross will try to push Israeli into suspending the construction
of Jewish homes in the West Bank and in East Jerusalem which the
Palestinian Authority claims to be its capital of a future state,
Foley said. He also will try to convince Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to make a further withdrawal from the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have been stuck in deadlock
for nine months since the Israeli government, in defiance of peace
accords agreed by the two sides, decided to build Jewish housing
units in Arab East Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has tried several
times, including a trip to the Middle East and recent talks in
Europe with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, to bring the two leaders back to
the negotiating table so that the peace process could be revived.
But all the efforts she has made ended in failure.
</P>
<P>
Albright's frustration in pulling the peace process back on
track thus prompted Clinton to announce last week to meet the
Israeli and Palestinian leaders in Washington next month.
</P>
<P>
Foley said Washington is still working on the basis of separate
contacts with both Middle East leaders. And the question of any
face-to-face Netanyahu-Arafat meeting was "hypothetical" at this
stage.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 23 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin appealed this evening for the relaunching of the peace
process between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony held at the prime minister's office building,
Hotel Matignon, to start the celebrations in France of the 50th
anniversary of the founding of the state of Israel, Jospin said
that Israel should follow the way opened in Madrid and Oslo.
</P>
<P>
He called on Israel to "resolutely relaunch the negotiations
with Yasser Arafat on the future of the (Israeli) occupied
territories."
</P>
<P>
He said that the decision made 50 years ago by the United
Nations to create simultaneously two states -- one Jewish and one
Arab -- signified that a state could not last long if it was not
accepted by its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
In his response to Jospin, Israeli ambassador to France Avi
Pazner said that Israel would do its best not to leave France
"disappointed".
</P>
<P>
"The deepest hope of Israel is to continue this peace process,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Former French FM Makes Secret Mission to Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Former French foreign minister
Claude Cheysson has lately made a secret mission to Algeria during
which he met with Algerian President Liamine Zeroual.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the LCI cable television channel,
Cheysson, who was foreign minister under former president Francois
Mitterrand, said that the "highest authorities (of France) are
very interested in the conclusions that I would draw from this
trip."
</P>
<P>
But Cheysson refused to reveal the content of his talks with
President Zeroual.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the on-going violence in Algeria mainly on religious
fanaticism, which he said "could not but be eradicated."
</P>
<P>
But he also accused organized crimes and "some elements of the
power" of participating in the violence, which has claimed at
least 60,000 lives over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Relations with Algeria are the most paradoxical issue in the
foreign policy of France, which was the former colonial power of
the North African nation.
