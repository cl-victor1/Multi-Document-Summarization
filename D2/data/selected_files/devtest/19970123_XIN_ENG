<HEADLINE> Slaloms Schedule Cancelled due to Fog </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Organisers cancelled one of their
two scheduled women's World Cup giant slaloms in Cortina
d'Ampezzo, in Italy, this weekend, after fog hit the area on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Cortina had been slated to host the giant slalom cancelled just
before Christmas at Morzine in a giant double-bill here on
Saturday and Sunday, with a downhill on Thursday and a Super-G on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, the fog ruled out Wednesday's scheduled training for
the downhill, forcing the session to be postponed to Thursday and
therefore the downhill race itself to Friday.
</P>
<P>
The changes left organisers with their original schedule here,
before they tried to re-stage the Morzine event. The Super-G will
be raced on Saturday and the giant on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Shuttle Atlantis Lands with Astronaut Blaha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. shuttle Atlantis landed
this morning, bringing four-month space traveler John Blaha back
to Earth after dropping off his replacement Jerry Linenger on
Russian Space Station Mir.
</P>
<P>
Atlantis passed on its first landing chance this morning
because of the heavy clouds. One and a half hour later, the
spacecraft touched down and rolled to a stop on the runway at 9:23
a.m. EST, fulfilling its flawless ten-day mission.
</P>
<P>
Atlantis and its six-member crew lifted off January 12. Two
days later, Atlantis docked with the Russian station for the fifth
time. During the five days of joint flight, the seven Americans
and two Russians moved near four tons of supplies and scientific
materials between two spacecraft. The two spaceships undocked on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Blaha, who was the third American to work on Mir, left Earth
aboard Atlantis on September 16 last year. His replacement
Linenger, a 42-year-old doctor, will work on Mir until late May,
when Atlantis is scheduled to pick up him and leave another U.S.
astronaut.
</P>
<P>
On the next space shuttle flight, Discovery and its seven crew
are to blast off February 11 for the second Hubble Space Telescope
servicing mission.

<HEADLINE> Iran Invites Afghan Militia for Talks in Tehran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government has
officially invited the Afghan Islamic militia Taliban for talks
to seek an end to the civil war, Iran's official news agency IRNA
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Alaeddin Boroujerdi, the Iranian deputy foreign minister for
Asia-Pacific affairs, said that Iran has invited the
fundamentalist student militia as a political group in Afghanistan
to attend the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"The invitation extended to the Taliban shows that Tehran, by
considering the existing realities into account, is willing to
help restore peace in Afghanistan and put an end to bloodshed
there," the official said.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that Iran's previous policy of encouraging all
Afghan groups to sit at the negotiating table and refrain
themselves from the war should be continued.
</P>
<P>
Although the policy of encouraging the Taliban to quit its
military policies has produced no results, such a policy should
not be abandoned, he noted.
</P>
<P>
An informed source was quoted as saying a Taliban delegation,
which is in Herat city near Iranian border with Afghanistan, will
arrive here next week.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban forces captured the Afghan capital of Kabul last
fall and established a self-styled government which has gained no
international recognition so far.
</P>
<P>
The same source said that Boroujerdi last week extended an
official invitation to Taliban to come to Iran for an All-Afghan
Conference to end the civil war in the war-torn state.
</P>
<P>
However, no specific date for the conference was reported yet.
</P>
<P>
The civil war in Afghanistan has lasted for 19 years both
during and after the former Soviet Union's occupation of the
country. It has left 1 million people dead, 2 million maimed and
8 million homeless.
</P>
<P>
Boroujerdi said that Iran has invited all Afghan groups and
the United Nations envoy for Afghanistan for peace talks in
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
He said the forthcoming peace talks would be a new step to help
restore peace and tranquility in the war-torn Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Afghan sources in Tehran said that major Afghan groups
including the Taliban have accepted the invitation and are now on
their way to the Iranian capital.
</P>
<P>
Boroujerdi said Pakistan has also been invited to send a
delegation to attend the talks here.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran believes that active participation of Pakistan in
the Afghan peace talks would be effective in bringing about an end
to the fighting in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan's ousted President Burhanuddin Rabbani has voiced
welcome to the meeting to be held in Tehran next week.
</P>
<P>
Several countries and international organizations will also
attend the meeting as observers.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, Iran to Enhance Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and Iran today
pledged to further strengthen their cooperation in agricultural
and industrial sectors.
</P>
<P>
The pledge was expressed here when high Pakistani officials met
with Ghaen Maghani, visiting Iranian deputy minister for planning
and economic affairs.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting between Pakistani Agriculture Minister
Shafqat Mahmood and the Iranian guest, Pakistan agreed to provide
training facilities to Iranians in the fields of water management,
plant protection and plant genetic engineering.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan will buy bulldozers from Iran in exchange for a sugar
plant.
</P>
<P>
Maghani and Mahmood also discussed matters related to
controlling locust swarms' growth.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that plant protection experts of the two countries
could operate jointly to check locust activities.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed today a memorandum of understanding
which envisages further promotion of air services and holding of
an experts meeting in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The document was signed by Maghani and Javed Burki, the
Pakistani prime minister's advisor on economic and financial
affairs after their meeting.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two countries also agreed to convene
the first meeting of a joint committee on trade here on February
6.
</P>
<P>
Iran expressed its interest in exporting iron ore to Pakistan,
which on its part stated that the process of pre-qualifying
suppliers including those from Iran is under way based on the
established procedures and criteria.
</P>
<P>
Both countries expressed satisfaction with the progress
achieved so far toward establishing an Iran-Pakistan oil refinery
and an Iran-Pakistan gas transmission project.
</P>
<P>
Maghani today also called on Minister of Industries and
Investment Sadiq Nawaz Awan.
</P>
<P>
They discussed cooperation between their two countries,
particularly in the industrial and engineering sectors.
</P>
<P>
Maghani said his country is ready to finance and work together
with Pakistan on mutually beneficial industrial projects.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani minister assured Maghani that the present
government is doing all it can to pave the way for further
improving and stabilizing the Pakistani-Iranian relationship.

<HEADLINE> Sweden to Investigate Nazi Gold Accusations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Sweden is to set up a working
group to investigate whether there are any unclaimed accounts in
Swedish banks of Jews killed by the Nazis and Nazi gold exchanged
for iron from Sweden during World War II.
</P>
<P>
The group, comprising officials of the foreign ministry,
central bank and bankers' association, and representatives of
Sweden's Jewish community, is to investigate only accounts into
which sums of money had been paid, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Many Jews were killed in Europe during the Second World War,
leaving their bank accounts unclaimed until now. Jewish
organizations believe that Jewish assets that have remained
dormant in Swiss banks could amount to several billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Yesterday's newspaper reports here published accusations that
the Swedish government knowingly delivered iron to Germany in
exchange for Nazi gold, 20 tons of which was stolen from Jews.
</P>
<P>
There has been increasing international interest in the issue
of gold in Nazi Germany. During the war, Allied countries warned
neutral nations to keep their hands off Nazi gold since the stolen
gold would be returned to its owners after the end of the war. But
Sweden and Switzerland knowingly accepted such gold, the
allegations claimed.
</P>
<P>
Christoph Graf, historian and director of the Swiss National
Archives Bureau, said Sweden and Switzerland are "in the same
boat" so far as Nazi gold is concerned. Therefore, neither
country has justifiable reasons to shirk their responsibility.

<HEADLINE> US Housing Starts Hits at 8-year High in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Housing starts in the U.S.
hit an eight-year high in 1996 but dropped by 12.2 percent in
December, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that the housing starts totaled 1.47
million homes and apartments last year, an increase of 8.8 percent
over 1.35 million in 1995.
</P>
<P>
It was also the highest since the U.S. housing starts reached
1.49 million in 1988.
</P>
<P>
All regions posted healthy gains last year. The starts were up
by 11.2 percent in the Northeast, 10.6 percent in the Midwest, 7.5
percent in the South and 8.8 percent in the West.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed much of the 1996 performance to low
interest rates at the same time the economy was boosting jobs and
incomes. But many expect the pace to slow this year while
remaining at a healthy level.
</P>
<P>
The report said that starts totaled a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 1.33 million in December, down by 12.2 percent from
last November and the biggest since a 16.7 percent decline in
January 1994.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, starts plunged by 29.2 percent in the West, 7.9
percent in the Midwest and 7.2 percent in the South. They also
slipped by 2.3 percent in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
Mortgage rate in U.S. averaged 7.60 percent for 30-year,
fixed-rate loans in December, down from 7.62 percent in November
and from the year's high of 8.32 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
The rate was as high as 9.15 percent in January 1995.
</P>
<P>
Applications for building permits -- often a barometer of
future activity -- slipped 0.6 percent in December, to a 1.41
million rate from 1.42 million in November, the Commerce
Department report said.

<HEADLINE> Xijiang Earthquake Causes Heavy Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KASHI (Xinjiang), January 22 (Xinhua) -- Two strong earthquakes
that rocked northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region
Tuesday morning have caused heavy loss of lives and damage to
property, the local seismological bureau reported today.
</P>
<P>
The tremors, measuring more than 6 on the Richter Scale, took
place in Jiashi County and several townships of nearby Artux City,
where it seriously damaged 1,650 houses and did some damage to
some 9,000 others. Half of the 296 villages in the county were
seriously affected.
</P>
<P>
Initial reports said that at least 12 people were killed and 42
others injured. More than 36,000 households with over 170,000
people in Jiashi were affected, and 6,210 houses were destroyed or
seriously damaged. It also killed 3,360 head of cattle, and
damaged schools, waterworks, mosques, and stables.
</P>
<P>
The local government has started relief work, and the general
mood of people in the quake-hit areas is said to be good.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials from the regional government and party
committee arrived at the quake-stricken areas today along with
relief funds and medical supplies, and PLA soldiers of the
People's Liberation Army and armed police joined the rescue and
relief work.
</P>
<P>
Most people said that they were greatly relieved by the sight
of officials and soldiers, but local authorities say that what
they most need is tents to ward off the winter colds.
</P>
<P>
Temperatures fell to minus 11 degrees celsius today in Jiashi,
and many of the local people whose homes were destroyed huddled
around bonfires to get warm.
</P>
<P>
"We learned a lesson from last year's earthquakes," said one
Uygur farmer. "My only concern is to build two simple houses to
pass the winter."
</P>
<P>
Also arriving in the quake-stricken area was a team of eleven
seismologists, sent by the Xinjiang Seismological Bureau shortly
after the quakes hit. An initial survey of the situation showed
that there could be possible aftershocks measuring more than 5 on
the Richter scale this week or next.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Pins Down Date for Palestinian State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority (PA)
President Yasser Arafat said today that an independent Palestinian
state will be declared after the end of the transitional phase.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian statehood is a Palestinian decision and not an
Israeli one, Arafat told a joint press conference with Arab League
Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid following their meeting
earlier today.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian state will be declared after the end of the
transitional phase, Arafat said in comment on Israeli Premier
Binyamin Netanyahu's warnings of "severe consequences" if the
Palestinian state comes into being.
</P>
<P>
Elaborating on the Jerusalem issue, Arafat said Netanyahu was
the official spokesman of the Israeli delegation to Madrid talks
which sanctioned the land for peace formula and the execution of
the U.N. Security Council resolutions 242 and 338, which
stipulate the Israeli withdrawal from all the lands it occupied in
the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
Under the landmark Hebron deal and other relevant documents,
the crucial issues such as the status of Jerusalem, Palestinian
refugees and the Palestinian statehood will be resolved in the
final status talks which will begin within two months after the
redeployment and end by mid-1999.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who was on his first visit to Egypt since the PA took
control of 80 percent of the West Bank city of Hebron last week,
said that the Hebron deal was "not an agreement but a protocol to
execute the original agreement."
</P>
<P>
"We should be alert until all agreements reached are accurately
implemented," he said, adding that there are still some 24 pending
issues between the two sides, including the release of
prisoners, the safe corridor, the Gaza airport and port, as well
as economic, commercial and financial issues.
</P>
<P>
The issue of the Israeli redeployment and withdrawal from the
rest of the West Bank is given priority as this is supposed to be
carried out over three stages starting in March this year and
ending by mid-1998, Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians signed an executive protocol with Israel last
Friday on implementing long-delayed Israeli troop pullbacks from
Hebron and rural areas of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arafat's Informational Advisor Nabiel Abu Redienah
said today that the PA will control 99 percent of the West Bank
after completion of the third phase of Israeli troop redeployment.
</P>
<P>
In a TV interview, Redienah said Israel has no right to decide
unilaterally on the size of the redeployment as this is included
in the signed agreements and the U.S. letter of guarantees annexed
to the Hebron deal.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Arafat briefed Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and the AL chief on the Palestinian position on the peace
process and a vision for the future after the Hebron accord.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure for home, Arafat said he will send
Palestinian Minister of Local Government Saeb Erakat Thursday to
meet with the League's Arab delegates to give them "a clear image"
of the issue.

MOSCOW, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Russia's State Duma, the lower
house of parliament, today failed to collect enough votes to
approve a resolution dismissing President Boris Yeltsin on the
grounds of ill health.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the 450-seat lower chamber, only
87 lawmakers supported the draft resolution, while 102 voted

</P>

Earlier today, the Duma voted 206-160 in favour of debating the

Amid attacks from opposition lawmakers, Yeltsin returned to the
Kremlin earlier today for a meeting with Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin, despite expectations that he would stay in his
country residence outside Moscow for at least another week.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin underwent heart bypass surgery on November 5 and
returned to the Kremlin on December 23. He was taken to Moscow's
Central Clinical Hospital on January 8 suffering from double
pneumonia, and left the hospital on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani President Calls Iran Ties Unbreakable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and Iran are bound
in unbreakable relations of Islam and their centuries-old ties
could not be harmed by the attempts of a handful of vested
interests, Pakistani President Farooq Leghari said today.
</P>
<P>
The president, on a brief visit to the country's southwestern
city of Quetta, told a press conference that Pakistan could not
even imagine any undesirable activities in Pakistan by any
brotherly country.
</P>
<P>
He said the entire Pakistan nation love their brethren in Iran
and have deep-rooted love and affection for the Iranian people,
according to local reports.
</P>
<P>
The friendship between Pakistan and Iran is time-tested and no
effort from selfish and vested interests could cast aspersions on
their most cordial relations.
</P>
<P>
A bomb blasted in Pakistan's eastern city of Lahore last
Saturday, killing 19 people including one religious leader. Some
Pakistanis hinted that Iran was behind the incident.
</P>
<P>
The president said Pakistan and Iran want to have a durable and
amicable settlement of the Afghan crisis and both are making
efforts to achieve the objective.
</P>
<P>
Iran, the president said, has some apprehension about the
Taliban but categorically stated that Pakistan neither interferes
in Afghanistan nor would like to see any other power meddle in the
internal affairs of that country.
</P>
<P>
Leghari said his country wants to see the Afghan problem solved
under the U.N. umbrella and it is up to the warring factions to
make joint and sincere efforts to bring the fratricidal war to an
early end.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan is in constant touch with all the factions
involved in the war and is doing its best to achieve an early and
durable peace in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has been accused of supporting the Taliban militia,
who took control of Kabul, the Afghan capital, last September
while Iranians are not happy to see them in power.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Lower House Adopts Resolution on Peru Standoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Japan's House of Representatives
today unanimously passed a resolution urging the government to
accelerate efforts toward a peaceful solution to the month-long
hostage crisis in Peru.
</P>
<P>
The resolution asks the government, in striving for the
imminent release of 73 captives being held by Peruvian rebels at
the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima, to give "top priority
to the lives of the hostages."
</P>
<P>
It also criticizes "the terrorist acts against the
international community which is seeking peace and security."
</P>
<P>
The resolution reconfirms "the principle of not giving in to
the terrorists" and expresses Japan's support for the Peruvian
government's efforts to achieve a peaceful end to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
A similar resolution will be adopted in a plenary session of
the House of Councillors on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Japanese government today renewed its call for
the early resumption of direct talks between the Peruvian
government and the hostage-taking Tupac Amaru Revolutionary
Movement rebels on ways to end the standoff.
</P>
<P>
"The process of creating a commission of guarantors is
currently continuing ... The Japanese government hopes this
process will bear fruit and produce concrete results," foreign
ministry spokesman Hiroshi Hashimoto told a press conference.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Govt Rapped for School Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Reports that some 11,000
children are not attending school after failing to secure form
one places have sparked angry reactions from the public with two
citing bad planning by the government as the major cause.
</P>
<P>
''This is a result of poor planning and failure by the
government to fulfill its policy on education for all,'' said the
Zimbabwe Teachers Union (ZTU) chief executive officer Felix Mafa
in a statement today.
</P>
<P>
Mafa said the failure to secure places by the children would
have a long-term impact on the children's secondary education
which could result in poor performances at junior certificate and
ordinary levels.
</P>
<P>
He said education is a basic right which should never be
tampered
</P>
<P>
with by anyone, including the government.
</P>
<P>
Mafa added the government needed to set its priorities right
by building more schools, roads, bridges and clinics instead of
concentrating on using taxpayers' money building luxury
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the opposition United Parties (UP) today said the
situation is a direct result of bad planning by the government
and corruption in the ministry of education.
</P>
<P>
UP spokesman Isaac Manyemba today said the crisis would
encourage corruption as some education ministry officials were
likely to ask for bribes in order to facilitate the enrollment of
a child.
</P>
<P>
''Many parents, out of desperation and love for their
children, will be forced to pay bribes so that their children can
start school,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Some 11,000 potential form one pupils, mostly from the high
density areas of Harare and Chitungwiza, failed to secure places
to begin their secondary education last week.

<HEADLINE> New York City Begins Spending to Combat Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The New York City, New York
State, Federal environmental officials and a coalition of small
watershed communities have worked out an agreement to save the
City's reservoirs from being polluted.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, New York City yesterday began spending 660
million U.S. dollars on a five-year program to cut the flow into
its 19 upstate reservoirs, and the City water bill will increase
regularly until by the year 2002. The watershed-agreement
increases will buy thousands of acres of land around the
reservoirs and upgrade more than 100 aging sewage treatment
plants.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will protect the water supply, which serves nine
million of people in the city and surrounding communities, and it
also puts off until at least 2002 a threatened order by the
Federal Environmental Protection Agency to keep the city's water
clean with a filtration plant, which would have been the largest
such plant in the world, filtering more than a billion gallons of
water a day from the city's reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
"This is a wonderful example of the Federal government working
with us rather than imposing mandates," Mayor Rudopph W. Giuliani
of New York City was quoted today by the New york Times as saying.
Environmental groups also praised the deal.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Minister on Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Despite glowing statistics, the
country's tourism sector is not performing as projected, a
cabinet minister said.
</P>
<P>
Opening the Zimbabwe Council for Tourism (ZCT) Congress today
in Bulawayo, Environment and Tourism Minister Chen Chimutengwende
said in 1996, regional markets accounted for 83.3 percent of
total arrivals in Zimbabwe, which was however, ranked fourth in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
''While growth figures may seemingly appear attractive,
tourism for the country has not been doing well vis-a-vis
competition in the region. Heavy reliance on regional markets
with a low propensity to spend as opposed to long haul markets
contributed to this weak performance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The two-day congress is being attended by all sectors of the
industry and senior government officials.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's tourism sector, considered one of the fastest
growing, accounts for 4.6 percent of gross domestic product and
employs over 83,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that in 1996 Zimbabwe, with 1.336 million
visitors, was ranked fourth in Africa but its earnings of 252.2
million U.S. Dollars were ranked ninth.
</P>
<P>
''In 1996 the country received 7.1 percent of total tourists
to Africa and a mere 2.5 percent total receipts. Clearly such a
position of increased arrivals and depressed earnings is
unhealthy and unacceptable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
To speed up black participation, the government preference for
leases and licenses would be given to indigenous companies or
joint ventures, he said.
</P>
<P>
The industry is currently 90 percent dominated by whites,
creating tension between the two racial groups.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed, ''it is not the government policy to
retain an all white tourism industry in terms of ownership. For
those who do not understand this, they need to ask themselves why
did black people go to war in this country.''
</P>
<P>
He said the best way to achieve it was through joint ventures
to create socio-economic democracy.
</P>
<P>
At the same occasion, Chairman of the Zimbabwe Council for
Tourism David Chapman said there are four areas that need to be
resolved urgently as they have a potential of derailing the
country's booming industry.
</P>
<P>
He cited lack of financial and tax incentives to encourage
major investment, massive disruptions to Air Zimbabwe's domestic
flights, up and down introduction of highly unpopular fees in
national parks, and the absence of a national strategic plan, as
some of the key areas needing immediate attention.

<HEADLINE> Private Education Encouraged in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican government said
here today that it is encouraging the development of private
education which it said is complementary to education provided by
the state.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Education, there are altogether
165 private schools in the country, 85 percent of which are run
by non-profitable funds. The students in these schools are mainly
from the poor families.
</P>
<P>
About 37,000 students were admitted into Mozambique's private
primary and high schools in 1996, accounting for only two percent
of the number of students studying in schools financed and run by
the government.
</P>
<P>
Government officials said the development of private schools,
which is still at a small scale compared with the state-run ones,
needs further incentives.
</P>
<P>
They said the government, though facing difficulty in
education funds, is trying to seek ways to foster private
education in the country.

<HEADLINE> Levy: Israel Ready to Resume Talks With Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 22 (Xinhua) -- In a strong call on Syria to
come back to negotiating table, Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy today said Israel would accept the UN Resolution 242 as basis
for resuming talks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a meeting with foreign ambassadors to Israel
convened to brief the just-completed Hebron pullback, Levy
believed that his statement would lead to the resumption of
peace talks with Syria, which have been suspended since early
last year.
</P>
<P>
He said the ball now was in the Syria's court as Israel
signaled its willingness to accept the UN Resolution 242, which
calls for Israeli withdrawal from all territories it seized during
the 1967 Middle East War, as the basis for resuming peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Levy renewed his call on his Syrian counterpart Farouk Shara to
meet him to discuss the peace talks at any time in any place. He
reportedly has already sent such message to Shara recently through
a European envoy.
</P>
<P>
Levy's statement received positive reactions from the
ambassadors of Egypt, Jordan and the United States, all of which
could play a crucial role in restarting the Israeli-Syrian talks.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Ambassador Mohammed Bassiouny termed Levy's statement
as "great," but added Israel should also recognize the
understandings reached between Syria and former Israel's Labor
government led by the slain prime minister Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
In the understandings, Israel agreed to total withdrawal from
the Golan Heights in return for signing a peace treaty with
Syria. But the current Likud government refuses to accept such
commitment.
</P>
<P>
"It's impossible to forget the understandings which have been
achieved during (the past) five years and start negotiations from
square N0.1," Bassiouny said.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Ambassador Omar Rifai also welcomed Levy's remarks,
saying it was important that the UN resolutions and the formula of
"land for peace" were accepted by all parties. He expected that
the Israeli-Syrian talks would be resumed soon.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador Martin Indyk also praised Levy's statement and
promised the U.S. would work together with Israel to restart the
stalled talks.
</P>
<P>
"I think that we have an opportunity now of working closely
with the government of Israel to try to get the negotiations with
Syria and Lebanon going again, and we will be working to do that,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Levy did not forget to blame the recent harsh
criticism of Israel coming from Arab capitals and other countries
over the often stalled negotiations on Hebron redeployment.
</P>
<P>
The minister also warned that deadlock in future talks would
naturally occur again, but it should not result in the freeze of
ties between Israel and Arab countries. He expressed the hope that
the Israeli-Arab relations would not be held hostages to the peace
talks.

<HEADLINE> Greece Faces New Wave of Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Greece is facing a new wave of
strikes as the country's largest trade union the General
Confederation of Greek Workers (GSEE) today called for a 24-hour
nationwide strike for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
GSEE is protesting against the government's new tax law which
abolishes a series of tax breaks for wage earners. The
confederation also wants higher pensions for state pensioners and
above-inflation pay rises.
</P>
<P>
The Athens labour center called on all its members to
participate in GSEE's strike. It said the capital's buses and
trolleys will stage a work stoppage during the strike while
employees at Olympic Airways will hold a stoppage from 12 am to
3 pm.
</P>
<P>
The decision by GSEE came amidst ongoing seamen strike which
has entered 10th day today and has left thousands of passengers
and trucks stranded at ports.
</P>
<P>
The seamen's strike started on January 13 and is due to end at
6 am Thursday. But the Panhellenic Seamen's Federation (PNO), which
has defied a Friday court ruling that declared the walkout
illegal, has warned that it may extend the strike if the
government continues to disregard their demands. They include
better pensions, insurance and favorable tax treatment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, state teachers launched a five-day strike on Monday
and threatened to extend it if the government rejects their
demands.

<HEADLINE> New York City Presents New Version of Subway Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The New York City, which has
the largest fleet of subway cars in the world, yesterday presented
a new and improved version of cars, the New York Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The new cars have an electronic sign displaying the time and
the next station stop; an automated announcement of the next stop
in a clear voice that can be overridden by conductor during delays
and route changes, and a "strip" map of subway line showing the
remaining stops with dots of light. The new cars have glass walls
at the ends, to reduce the riders' sense of isolation.
</P>
<P>
For Transit Authority employees, the new models have several
advantages. A high-technology speedometer will be standard, giving
operators their exact speed. There will also be an electronic
monitoring screen in the operator's cab that can pinpoint the
nature and location of mechanical problems.
</P>
<P>
Two models of the new cars have been tested on some lines for
three years. In April, this year, The Transit Authority will put
out to bid a 2 billion U.S. dollars contract for about 70 new cars
to replace the oldest in its fleet of 5,900 cars. A second order
of 100 to 160 cars will be placed a little later.

PARIS, January 22 (Xinhua) -- France today expressed its worry
over what it called "the situation of civil war" in Sudan, and
called on all conflicting parties to begin dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"We are worried and we deplore the situation of civil war

The Sudanese government has accused neighboring Ethiopia and
Eritrea of joining the fighting "under an American plot," an
accusation rejected by both Addis Ababa and Asmara.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Sudanese opposition coalition of Democratic
National Alliance, which groups the opposition in the north and
guerrillas in the south of Sudan, claimed today that it has
conquered the frontier towns of Kurmuk and Qeissan near the
Ethiopian border.
</P>
<P>
"The conflict in Sudan will not find a lasting settlement
except in a negotiated political solution in conformity with the
aspirations of the people concerned," said the spokesman of the

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP)
and the U.N. Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) will
provide 11.7 million U.S. Dollars worth of aid to the repatriated
soldiers of Angola's former two warring parties.
</P>
<P>
The action plan was announced here today by a letter presented
by WFP envoy, Lopes Da Silva, to Angola's Minister of Social
Welfare and Settlement, Albino Malungo.
</P>
<P>
The grant is aimed at helping the southern African country
achieve national unity and reconciliation in the post-war era,
said Silva while handing over the letter.
</P>
<P>
Angola's national unity government is scheduled to be sworn in
on January 25 with the formation of a united armed force made up
by both the former government troops and the former rebel
movement, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Massive recruitment had been made during the nearly 20 years
of civil war in Angola. But with peace finally established in the
country, an estimated 100,000 ex-soldiers and officers from both
sides of the warring parties have to be demobilized.
</P>
<P>
The re-settlement of the former fighters are key to a lasting
peace in the country, said the U.N. envoy.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government to Issue Treasury Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
float some 2 billion pesos (76.3 million U.S. pesos) worth of
fixed rate treasury bonds in April this year to generate more
funds, a senior financial official said today.
</P>
<P>
The proposed flotation of government bonds, which will mature
in 20 years' time, is part of the government's move to increase
the issuance of its securities such as the 5, 7, and 10-year bond
instruments, Treasury Bureau chief Caridad Valdehuesa said.
</P>
<P>
She said that Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo had already
approved the proposed flotation, which will coincide with the
centennial anniversary celebration of the Department of Finance
(DOF) in April this year.
</P>
<P>
Valdehuesa assured the dealers, comprising mostly of financial
institutions based on last year's market trends, that the issuance
of government bonds this year would be good considering that the
government has already attained fiscal stability.
</P>
<P>
She encouraged the bankers to have more confidence in the
market system as the government is doing everything to put the
government securities market in order.
</P>
<P>
Some dealers and brokers expressed fear that their clients, who
are mainly insurance companies, may be hesitant to invest in
long-term securities owing to the forthcoming election spree and
the volatility of the interest rates.

<HEADLINE> Tung Chee Hwa Wins "1996 Leader of the Year" Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Tung Chee Hwa has won
the Award of the "1996 Leader of the Year", for which a grand
ceremony was held here this evening.
</P>
<P>
The Leader of the Year Award, now in its third year, was
jointly sponsored by Sing Tao Daily and Hong Kong Standard.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Sing Tao Ltd. Ms Sally Aw said that the Award
was created to recognize a special individual who has made
significant contributions to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the Panel of Judges, Peter K.C. Woo said
that Tung's excellent diversity in experience offers the type of
background that is needed to lead Hong Kong through the transition
and in terms of leading Hong Kong into the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
"Mr Tung's manifesto on the way forward was clearly articulated
and his approach to handling his important assignment is
deliberate and professional," he said.
</P>
<P>
Accepting the Award, Tung said that the handover of Hong Kong
marks a new era. Hong Kong is ready to be led by one of its own: a
person who is from this community and therefore understands more
the needs and aspirations of the Hong Kong people, and a person
who truly takes the long-term interest of Hong Kong as his top
objective.
</P>
<P>
"I accept this award in humility knowing that it is not based
on what I have achieved for Hong Kong so far but in the knowledge
of what Hong Kong people expect from me in the months and years
ahead. I promise I will not let them down," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Manila Refuses Rebels' Demand to Withdraw Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine military today
refused to pull out its troops from a town in southern Mindanao
island as demanded by the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF).
</P>
<P>
General Arnulfo Acedera, chief of staff of the Armed Forces,
said today the government troops will not quit their positions in
Buldon in the southern Maguindanao province, the site of fierce
battles between them and the MILF rebels on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Acedera urged the MILF to remove their checkpoints in
the territories they controlled to ensure people's freedom of
movement.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, fierce battles broke out between the government
troops and the MILF rebels in Buldon, a heavily-fortified MILF
bastion, killing 20 MILF rebels and six soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Major Eduardo Oban, the Armed Forces' public information
officer, said that the two sides had agreed to reach a ceasefire
agreement in Maguindanao on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Oban said the military was working for the temporary cessation
of hostilities so the peace talks between the MILF and the
government would continue.
</P>
<P>
The MILF and the government began their long-delayed first
exploratory peace talks on January 9 and agreed to meet again on
February 25-26.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a breakaway group of the Moro National Liberation
Front (MNLF), refused to accept the peace deal forged last
September between the government and the MNLF, and sought its own
peace talks with the government.

URUMQI, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Assistance funds and goods are
being rushed to Altay Prefecture in northwest China's Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region to help local people cope with the recent
heavy snowstorm and to help protect their livestock.
</P>
<P>
So far, 520,000 yuan (about 62,600 US dollars) has been donated
by local people, along with more than 7,600 pieces of clothing, 25
tons of grain, and 1,800 tons of feed.

<HEADLINE> PNA Briefs AL on Hebron Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) today submitted a detailed report to the Arab League (AL) on
the Palestinian-Israeli talks on implementing the Israeli troop
pullback from the West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
PNA Minister of Local Government Saeb Erakat, who is in charge
of the Palestinian negotiations with the Israeli side, presented
the report to the meeting of the permanent delegates of the
22-member Arab alliance.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian top negotiator, who arrived here on Wednesday
evening, also expounded the vision of the Palestinians towards
the coming stage in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Erakat was sent on a mission to give the AL delegates a clear
image of the peace development, while PNA President Yasser Arafat
made a several hours' tour here the same day in his first visit to
Egypt since the PNA took control of 80 percent of Hebron under a
landmark deal with Israel.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Arafat separately briefed Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and AL Secretary General Esmat Abdul-Meguid on the
implementation of the just-concluded Hebron executive protocol and
discussed with them on the forthcoming talks with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The AL chief renewed his support to a just and comprehensive
Mideast peace to be based on the land-for-peace principle and the
international resolutions concerned.
</P>
<P>
Before departure, Arafat said that he was soliciting Egyptian
and Arab support for the next stage of Israeli-Palestinian talks.
</P>
<P>
"After the interim agreements, we will declare an independent
Palestinian state," he told reporters at the Arab League
headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
The PNA now controls the Gaza Strip and eight West Bank towns
handed over by Israel under several agreements signed since
1993. It will control 99 percent of the West Bank after completion
of the third phase of Israeli troop redeployment in the first half
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The final status of these areas, which Israel captured in the
1967 Mideast War, together with other sensitive issues such as
Jerusalem, refugees and the Palestinian statehood, is to be
determined in talks that should be concluded no later than May
1999.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first country to make peace with Israel, has been a
strong advocate of the Palestinian cause.

<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- In joint effort by the
Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China (CPC)
Central Committee, the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television,
the Press and Publication Administration, and the All-China
Journalists' Federation, China publicized a series of press
criteria today in an effort to halt the practice of paid news.
</P>
<P>
The criteria are in keeping with resolutions of the CPC Central
Committee on ethical and cultural progress, and are intended to
improve the moral conduct of the country's journalists, and to
stop the practice of paid news, safeguard the press's reputation
and image, and produce a contingent of clean and honest
journalists.
</P>
<P>
The All-China Journalists' Association and news organizations
will open public hotlines to handle complaints related to this
practice.
</P>
<P>
Under the new rulings, the press cannot accept any form of
payment for interviews, or for editing and publishing news
stories. Journalists are not to ask the interviewees for payments,
nor are they allowed to accept money, gifts, gratuities, or other
items such as credit cards from the interviewees.
</P>
<P>
They note further that journalists cannot borrow or use on a
trial basis in any way motor vehicles, housing, household
appliances, or telecommunications facilities, offered by
interviewees.

<TEXT>
<P>
Journalists are neither to ask for or accept bonuses when they
attend press conferences, news briefings, and other celebrations,
according to the criteria, which state also that journalists, who
are on the payroll of a certain news organization, should not
accept payment from other institutions and enterprises, or for
second jobs. And they should not serve as reporters, special
reporters, or contributors concurrently, without getting approval
from the employer.
</P>
<P>
The criteria also state that journalists should not form groups
to go on reporting tours without the proper permit.
</P>
<P>
They should not ask for special living allowances that are not
connected with their work, and they should not wine and dine
lavishly at public expense.
</P>
<P>
Journalists are not to take advantage of work privileges for
personal benefit, and are not to use threats, such as "exposing
someone or something" or "inside reporting" for personal interest
or gain.
</P>
<P>
The criteria also explain that news stores are to be strictly
differentiated from advertisements, and that stories should not be
paid for. Advertisements for enterprises or their products should
not appear in the form of a news story.
</P>
<P>
Special issues, or journals, or pages, or columns and programs
belonging to the business of advertising should have a notice or
wording that distinguishes them from other forms of information.
</P>
<P>
News stories should distinguish themselves from sponsored
writing, and journalists should not make use of interviews or
publication of stories to get sponsorship of any kind.

<P>
News organizations should manage finances in a central way and
control funds from sponsors or other groups that come in for
"article contributions, contests, or special programs". These
sorts of funds should be properly used and properly audited.
</P>
<P>
According to the criteria, sponsored programs and columns are
allowed to print only the name of the sponsor, and not their photo
or that of their products in words, sound, or image.
</P>
<P>
The criteria also call for news organizations to keep reporting
separate from business. They should have special staff members
involved only in business, such as advertising, and should ask
their reporters to make money. Journalists should not become
involved in advertising or other business.
</P>
<P>
The country's news organizations are required to work out their
own measures to put these new criteria into effect, and can be
fined or penalized in some other way for failing to do so. They
can be subject to internal criticism, Party discipline, dismissal,
or charged with illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
More serious disregard of the criteria can result in
administrative punishment by the Ministry of Radio, Film and
Television, and the Press and Publication Administration.
</P>
<P>
Government departments may reveal cases to the press in a move
to enforce this stand against paid news in a more effective way.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Tied by his chronic absence, the Russian Parliament voted to
remove President Boris Yeltsin from office. The vote had no legal
force, but reflected a sharp decline in public support for the
president.
</P>
<P>
-- The United States has decided to sell highly sophisticated
air-to-air missiles to Thailand. Southeast Asia has become a
busting arms bazaar in an era when business, not ideology, is
driving arms sales.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Defying U.S. efforts to isolate Cuba, Canadian Foreign
Minister Lloyd Axworthy announced today a 14-point agreement with
Havana that pledges cooperation on human rights and seeks to
shield foreign investors targeted for punishment by Washington.
</P>
<P>
-- Four months after President Clinton signed a law last year
barring financial transactions between American corporations and
countries accused of supporting terrorism, the administration
quietly exempted Sudan, where a U.S. oil company was seeking a
stake in a 930 million U.S. dollar oil deal, according to federal
officials and documents.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton strongly predicted a deal on balancing the
budget. He also called for a bipartisan commission to study Social
Security and Medicare reforms, adding that he may support raising
Medicare premiums for "wealthier" senior citizens and increasing
the Social Security eligibility age. Clinton indicated he would be
flexible on cutting taxes, particularly on capital gains, if
Congress will bend on some of his priorities.
</P>
<P>
-- The Senate cleared Clinton's nominees for secretaries of
state and defense. The confirmation votes were unanimous for,
respectively, former U.N. envoy Madeleine Albright and former
Sen. William Cohen. Albright is the first woman in the post, and
Cohen will be the only cabinet Republican.

<HEADLINE> French Supreme Court Rejects Appeal of Nazi Collaborator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 23 (Xinhua) --- The French supreme court today
formally rejected an appeal by Maurice Papon, former Gaullist
minister and Secretary General of the Prefecture of Gironde from
1942 to 1944.
</P>
<P>
The 82-year-old former Nazi collaborator, who served as
minister and Paris police commissioner in the post-war government
under Charles de Gaulle, could be given life imprisonment if
convicted of crimes against humanity in deporting some 2,000 Jews
to Nazi death camps.
</P>
<P>
The rejection was immediately welcomed by Michel Slitinsky, one
of the representatives of the 1,690 Jews who were rounded up in a
concentration camp in Drancy in 1942-44 and transported to Germany
at the order of Papon, who was then in charge Jewish files in
Gironde.
</P>
<P>
Calling the rejection a "great victory of the cause we have
defended," Slitinsky, who escaped from a rounding up operation by
the Vichy police and militias on October 19, 1942, noted that it
took only four years to drive out the Nazis, but 15 years to put
Papon to justice.

<P>
HARARE, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Projected climatic changes in
the Sub-Saharan Africa region are likely to result in adverse
effects on human health, ecological systems and food production,
a Zimbabwean government official said today.
</P>
<P>
Presenting a paper on climate change at an environment
workshop in Kadoma of central Zimbabwe, Head of the Climatic
Change Department in the Ministry of Environment and Tourism Todd
Ngara said more vector-borne diseases would affect people because
of the climate changes.
</P>
<P>
He said hydro-electric projects in many countries like Ghana,
Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe are at risk of collapsing because of
the climatic changes which brought recurrent droughts.
</P>
<P>
The major source of electricity in Zimbabwe, Lake Kariba is at
its lowest level ever, threating the generation of electricity
serving Zimbabwe and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
''By 2025, it is estimated that all the major river basins in
Africa other than the Congo will be water scarce,'' Todd Ngara
said.
</P>
<P>
He said atmospheric concentrations of green house gases which
are responsible for the climatic changes are increasing rapidly
due to fossil fuel use, land use changes and agricultural
practices.
</P>
<P>
But the Zimbabwean government is encouraging afforestation so
as to achieve a zero net of green house gas emissions to balance
between depletion and regeneration, Ngara added.
</P>
<P>
Over 70 participants from various government departments,
non-governmental organisations and scientific research
organisations attended the workshop which ended today.

<HEADLINE> Hashimoto, Fujimori Discuss Hostage Issue By Phone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto today discussed a 36-day hostage crisis with Peruvian
President Alberto Fujimori over phone.
</P>
<P>
After the discussion, Hashimoto told reporters at his official
residence that he had informed Fujimori of resolutions passed by
both houses of the Japanese Diet on Wednesday and today.
</P>
<P>
In the resolutions, the Diet voiced its full support for the
Japanese government's stance to make every effort for a swift and
peaceful solution to the hostage crisis, without giving in to the
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto quoted Fujimori as saying that he will make all-out
efforts to organize a proposed guarantor commission, which the
president described as requiring patience, Kyodo news service
reported.
</P>
<P>
Some 15 Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) rebels, armed
with rifles and grenades, stormed a cocktail party at the Japanese
ambassador's residence in Lima early last December and took
roughly 500 hostages.
</P>
<P>
However, the rebels later released most of the hostages. Now,
73 people are still in captivity, including two Peruvian
ministers, generals, security chiefs and about two dozen Japanese
businessmen and diplomats and the Japanese and Bolivian
ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian government and the MRTA are still negotiating. The
government has rejected rebel demand that their 400 jailed
comrades be released.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Banks, Future Market for Int'l Accounting Firms (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- International auditors are to
be invited to check the books of China's premier bank, the Bank of
China, for the first time ever.
</P>
<P>
The landmark move was announced by Wang Xuebing, President of
the the Bank of China. He has disclosed that the bank plans to
allow foreign accounting firms to audit several local branches of
the Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an annual conference attended by heads of BOK's
local branches, Wang said, "It by no means implies that I don't
believe the leaders of the branches to be audited. I just want to
learn some international experience, and to let the branches
improve their performance and to generate more profits."
</P>
<P>
Malpractice in some of the bank's local branches have brought
about huge losses, according to the president.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, leaders of many other Chinese banks have also
cherished the idea, as the government is encouraging former
state-owned specialized banks to become commercialized by
attaching greater importance to profit-making and improving
performance.
</P>
<P>
According to some local experts, Chinese state-owned commercial
banks are trying to strengthen audit department and to become more
transparent and capable of fighting risks.
</P>
<P>
But the country lacks audit companies that are up to
international standards.

<P>
Some local observers said that Chinese banks present a huge
market with great potential for international auditing firms.
</P>
<P>
With their experience, the participation of overseas auditors
will push forward the reforms and development of domestic banks,
and will also help elevate many Chinese auditing firms to
international levels.
</P>
<P>
Only China Minsheng Banking Corporation, the first
non-governmental bank in the country, has so far invited Price
Waterhouse International Accounting Company of the United States
as auditors to prepare its 1996 financial report.
</P>
<P>
The bank has taken the move to show its willingness to become a
real commercial bank, operating in line with international
practice.
</P>
<P>
There are still disputes in China about the necessity to invite
international auditors into domestic banks, but international
accounting firms can not wait for long, and many of them have
already settled in China.
</P>
<P>
So far, 14 overseas accounting companies, including almost all
the world-famous names, have opened nearly 30 offices in major
Chinese cities of Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
Nine of them have opened joint accounting offices with Chinese
partners, while four have started to accept Chinese accounting
firms as members.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that it is an international practice for banks to
employ international auditors. They said that along with the
acceleration of Chinese banks' commercialization and
internationalization, inviting foreign auditor will be commonplace
in the near future.

<HEADLINE> Austrian All-male Orchestra to Admit Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The world-famous Vienna
Philharmonic Orchestra will soon admit women musicians for the
first time in its 150-year history.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made in parliament by outgoing Scientific
Research and Arts Minister Rudolf Scholten, who said the orchestra
was presenting him with a "farewell gift."
</P>
<P>
Professor Werner Resel, head of the orchestra, told Vienna
television Wednesday night that the orchestra will end its
all-male recruitment policy and open its doors to famous women
musicians from all over the world to become full members.
</P>
<P>
Agreement on allowing women into the orchestra was reached in
talks between the arts ministry and union representatives of the
state opera orchestra, which the Philharmonic is part of.
</P>
<P>
But the final decision will be made by a full session of the
orchestra, Resel said.
</P>
<P>
Besides performances at the National Opera Theater, orchestra
members also put on performances after work hours, such as the
Vienna New Year Concert.
</P>
<P>
Resel said that was why the orchestra has not admitted female
musicians since it was founded.
</P>
<P>
The orchestra has been under pressure for some time to allow
women musicians to join, particularly from women's organizations.
</P>
<P>
Women's organizations in the United States said they would seek
a boycott of guest performances by the Vienna Philharmonic because
of the orchestra's male-only recruitment rules.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia
are pushing northwards to the key Salang pass after overrunning
two strategic towns north of Kabul earlier today, reports reaching
here said.
</P>
<P>
Jabul Siraj and Gulbahar, two towns lie at the mouth of the
Panjsher valley, some 90 kilometers north of Kabul, were captured
today in a two-pronged offensive launched by the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Jabul Siraj, formerly under the control of the Uzbek warlord
Rashid Dostum's troops, lies at the base of the towering Salang
valley, which divides northern and southern Afghanistan. Gulbahar
was a traditional bastion of the ousted Afghan government's
defense minister Ahmad Shah Masood.
</P>
<P>
By taking Jabul Siraj, the Taliban are poised to control the
Salang tunnel on the highway linking Kabul with the central Asian
republics.
</P>
<P>
The Pajsher valley was Masood's stronghold which had been the
site of pitched battles between the Taliban and the anti-Taliban
opposition alliance led by Masood and Dostum.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban militia were continuing its advance northwards
towards the strategically crucial Salang pass, which marks the
threshold of Dostum's kingdom, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few days, the Taliban forces have taken the
airbase at Bagram, 50 kilometers north of Kabul, and the Parwan
provincial capital of Charikar, 64 kilometers to the north of the
capital.

<HEADLINE> Inauguration of Angola's Unity Govt Set To Be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The inauguration of Angola's
national unity government, scheduled for January 25, may well be
delayed as some key issues are not yet settled by the country's
former rival groups.
</P>
<P>
The message was brought up by Isaias Samakuva, chief
negotiator of the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA), who arrived here today from the central city of
Bailundo, the military stronghold of the former rebel movement.
</P>
<P>
For one thing, the role to be played by UNITA leader Jonas
Savimbi in the central government of national unity and
reconciliation, has not yet been finalised.
</P>
<P>
How to share power in the local governments between the
Angolan Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola headed by
President Eduardo Dos Santos
and the UNITA headed by Savimbi, also remained uncertain, especially
when UNITA refused to waive their control in vast the land of the
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Now, two days before the scheduled inauguration of the
national unity government, only 5536 UNITA soldiers and officers
have joined the united armed forces, a number far lower than the
planned 26,300.
</P>
<P>
And only 629 UNITA men and women have joined national police
force, a number far fewer than the planned 5,200.
</P>
<P>
The administrative program which the UNITA had put across was
vetoed by the present government headed by President Dos Santos,
even enlarging the already discrepancy between the two former
rivals.
</P>
<P>
So far, the UNITA officials have not arrived at the capital,
further casting a shadow on the scheduled formation of the unity
government in the southern African country after over 20 years of
civil war.

<HEADLINE> Telecommunications Keep Growing Rapidly in Ningxia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region made strenuous efforts last year to develop its
telecommunication industry.
</P>
<P>
The industry scored a business turnover of 339 million yuan in
1996, up virtually 48 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The region's per-capita income from the telecommunications
industry hit 59,000 yuan in 1996, two times that of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia set aside 1.44 billion yuan of fixed assets investment
in the telecommunications industry last year.
</P>
<P>
The region's telecommunications grew rapidly thanks to the
improvement in its infrastructure construction.
</P>
<P>
With 285 kilometers of trunk optical cables built in 1996, the
region's optical cables stretched 1,131 kilometers to cover all
its cities and counties.
</P>
<P>
The region's telephone switching capacity increased by 70,000
lines to reach 378,000 lines last year. There were six telephones
for every 100 people in 1996, as against a ratio of 4.5 per 100 in
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The development of telecommunications has helped to closely
link the interior region with the outside world.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the region introduced more than 38 million US dollars
of foreign investment, and earned 180 million US dollars from
exports.

JINAN, January 23 (Xinhua) -- While most college students
prefer to work in big cities like Beijing and Shanghai after
graduation, some promising grads have been selected to work at the
grass-roots level in Rushan City in Shandong Province,
</P>
<P>
"By sending competent people to work on the frontier of
economic construction, the local government is trying to make them
more adaptable to the fierce competition they are bound to face in

</P>
<P>
Xiao Shujuan, a female college graduate who started working

dozen reports with new ideas like "How to do a good job in women's
work in the socialist market economy."
</P>
<P>
She has also provided over 100 items of useful information
for local peasants to help a number of them earn more money.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Gets ADB Loan to Improve Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
announced today it will provide Nepal a loan of 27.5 million U.S.
dollars to upgrade the Tribhuva International Airport in
Kathmandu.
</P>
<P>
A 27 million dollar interest-free loan will be used to expand
the airport's international terminal and construct a new
cargo-handling facility and additional aircraft parking aprons,
the Manila-based bank said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The ADB said civil aviation plays a significant role in the
economy of the land-locked Nepal as almost all tourists arrive by
air and tourism is a major source of the country's foreign
exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the ADB will provide the country with a technical
assistance grant of 500,000 dollars to help transform its
state-run Department of Civil Aviation into a self-supporting
agency.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the airport improvement project is 47.6
million dollars and additional financing will be provided by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).

<HEADLINE> Kind Hearted Garbage Man Returns Fortune </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 23 (Xinhua) -- A load of old rubbish turned
out to have a silver lining for a garbage collector in east
China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Wu Xingcai, who runs a salvage station in Pujiang county,
handed over just five yuan to an old lady for a handful of waste.
</P>
<P>
But when Wu examined the garbage he discovered that it
contained a wallet, and two bankbooks containing a total of 10,500
yuan, along with personal ID documents belonging to the seller.
</P>
<P>
Then Wu proved that he had a heart of gold. Realizing that his
elderly customer was probably unaware that she had discarded her
savings, he decided to return her bankbooks containing the 10,500
yuan and all her personal IDs.
</P>
<P>
Wu, from Puyang Township in Pujiang county, east China's
Zhejiang Province, discovered the wallet by chance among heaps of
waste paper in his salvage station.
</P>
<P>
He opened the wallet and found the bank deposit book, a seal
and a couple of personal IDs belonging to Shi Yuzheng.
</P>
<P>
"She must be worried about her lost money, and I knew I had to
return it as soon as possible," Wu said, adding, "I think it would
have been immoral and disgraceful to keep such ill-gotten wealth,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Shi, 76, a local resident who lives not far from the salvage
station, had collected four kilograms of waste cardboard boxes and
sold it to Wu for 5.3 yuan.
</P>
<P>
She never gave a thought to her wallet concealed among the
boxes, she said later.
</P>
<P>
She did not know she lost the wallet until Wu returned it, said
one of Shi's neighbours.
</P>
<P>
Wu's actions won praise from his neighbours, but the kind
hearted garbage man said that anybody would do the same when they
thought about others.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Tops 119 Yen In Tokyo, Stocks Fall on Strong Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar advanced further
in Tokyo today to hit a 47-month high of 119.45 yen at one point
amid expectations that investors will keep buying the dollar to
invest in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The dollar hit its highest level since February 1993, but later
eased back on selling to book profits and stop losses.
</P>
<P>
Although Vice Minister of International Trade and Industry
Tsutomu Makino voiced concern over the pace of the yen's decline
against the dollar, his comment that the impact of the yen's fall
on the Japanese economy has been "neutral" so far helped drive the
dollar upward.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the dollar's ascence against the yen dispirited
stock market investors on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, knocking the
key Nikkei index to drop below the 18,000 threshold.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section closed at 17,909.46, dropping 104.42 points or 0.58
percent from Wednesday's close.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index, covering all issues
on the market's First Section, ended 8.87 points or 0.64 percent
lower at 1,369.75.

<HEADLINE> Peace Deal Brings Hope for Ordinary Somalis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The peace deal made by
Somalia's two major faction leaders in the divided capital of
Mogadishu has showed signs of hope for ordinary Somalis.
</P>
<P>
Today, in Mogadishu's Bakara business center, the value of the
U.S. Dollar has dropped dramatically from its high of 8,300
Somali Shillings to its current value of 7,600 Shillings, the
lowest since last July.
</P>
<P>
The food prices dropped drastically. A 50 Kg sack of flour is
at present valued at 16 U.S. Dollars, compared with 20 U.S.
Dollars before the signing of the peace deal by South Mogadishu's
faction leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid and North Mogadishu's
warlord Ali Mahdi Mohamed on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The price of cooking oil was cut by 59 U.S. Dollars per barrel
(200 liters), down from the original price of 164 U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The prices of sorghum, maize and rice also dropped and the
downward trend will continue in the next few days, according to
wholesalers in the food market.
</P>
<P>
The capital's weapons market was also affected. The ammunition
of the assault rifles, which had valued more than 9,000 Somali
Shillings, can be obtained today at about 2,000 Somali Shillings
in the wholesale stores.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the United Nations Development Program
and the World Food Program arrived at Mogadishu on Wednesday, a
sign that the flow of international aid into the Horn of Africa
country will continue with ceasefire maintained and security
situation improved.

HOHHOT, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The fat-tail sheep that has
inhabited the prairies of north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region for nearly seven centuries has been given the opportunity
to travel abroad.
</P>
<P>
According to the region's husbandry departments, over 100,000
sheep, which are fat and fast-growing and have a remarkable

</P>
<P>
"The mutton is delicious," said an official with the

Arabia now add up to about a million.
</P>
<P>
And, "one sheep is priced at around 120 US dollars, double that
of the Australian and New Zealand sheep," he noted.
</P>
<P>
To increase exports, the regional foreign trade department has

TOKYO, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Japan's merchandise trade surplus
in 1996 fell by 32.4 percent over 1995 to 61.32 billion
U.S. dollars, the Finance Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The drop for the fourth consecutive year was attributed to
strong imports of crude oil, as well as personal computers and
other office equipment.
</P>
<P>
Export increased by 7.7 percent to 406.68 billion dollars,
while imports advanced by 20.4 percent to 345.36 billion dollars,
the ministry said in a preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
Japan's trade surplus with the United States fell 16.5 percent
to 32.29 billion dollars last year, posting a drop for the second

<HEADLINE> International Chamber of Commerce Sets Up Regional Office in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The International Chamber of
Commerce (ICC), the world business organization, has officially
opened an Asian regional office in Hong Kong on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Louise Barrington, the new director of the ICC-Asia, said the
move showed that the international business world is confident
Hong Kong will remain one of the world's leading commercial and
financial centers after its handover later this year.
</P>
<P>
Barrington is a lawyer and a member of the Bars of Ontario and
New York, whose main task is to promote arbitration under ICC
rules.
</P>
<P>
The ICC International Court of Arbitration is the world's
leading institution for settling international commercial disputes
by arbitration.
</P>
<P>
Barrington said more extensive use of the ICC arbitration
clause in international contracts in Asia would help companies in
the region to expand their business. "This will give confidence
to foreign entrepreneurs arriving to form new partners, since they
already know ICC arbitration and rely on it for dispute
resolution," she said.
</P>
<P>
She cited Hong Kong's excellent international trading and
financial systems, advanced communications infrastructure, skilled
and experienced work force, efficient and cosmopolitan environment
and minimal red tape as the main reasons for placing the ICC's
first-ever branch office here.
</P>
<P>
And Hong Kong's proximity to China - the magnet of growth and
investments in the future - is another asset.
</P>
<P>
The ICC's purpose is to promote open international trade and
investment, and the market economy system throughout the world.
It is a private group, making rules that govern the conduct of
business across borders.
</P>
<P>
It also provides essential services to international business
operators, foremost among them the ICC International Court of
Arbitration.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1919, the ICC now has over 7,000 member companies
and business associations in more than 130 countries and regions
worldwide.

<HEADLINE> China Discovers Large Deposits of Oil, Gas in Northwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, January 23 (Xinhua) -- China has discovered another
120 million tons of oil and 16.6 million cubic meters of natural
gas in geological reserves in the Basin between Shanxi and Gansu
provinces and the Ningxia Hui autonomous region in the northwest.
</P>
<P>
The discoveries, made by the Changqing Petroleum Exploration
Bureau, show that the basin has strong prospects for oil and gas
explorations.
</P>
<P>
The bureau, famed for its oil and gas discoveries, has verified
in the Basin between 1991 and 1995, more than 320 billion cubic
meters of natural gas, or 47 percent of the country's total gas
reserves confirmed in the period.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the discoveries are "an encouraging breakthrough
in China's oil industry."
</P>
<P>
The experts predicted that more oil and gas reserves will be
discovered, and the recent discovery has proved that the
prediction is accurate.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has invested a total of 420 million yuan (50.6
million US dollars) in the field. China is building gas pipelines
from the basin to Xi'an and Beijing, with the two cities having
gas supplies in July and September next year, respectively.

<HEADLINE> Kazakstan Gets ADB Aid for Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
today announced that it will grant Kazakstan 1.2 million US
dollars in technical aid designed to strengthen the country's
agriculture sector.
</P>
<P>
The grant will be used for a study to review investment
opportunities and challenges facing the country's agriculture
sector, the Manila-based ADB said.
</P>
<P>
The review will identify progress achieved since Kazakstan, a
former Soviet republic, became an independent state in 1991, and
assess opportunities in the agriculture sector amid rapid changes
taking place, particularly the transformation of state farms in
private entities.
</P>
<P>
Under the aid program, a project will be prepared for possible
Bank-financing that will build upon farm and agribusiness
privatization, promote direct investments in the agriculture
sector, and increase rural incomes.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture accounts for about 15 percent of the country's
gross domestic product, 17 percent of employment, and 10 percent
of export earnings. Kazakstan produces wheat and livestock in the
northern and central regions, and cotton and rice in the south.
</P>
<P>
However, only a single crop each year is produced due to the
country's dry climate and short growing season. Farm privatization
alone has not yet been sufficient to stimulate improved
agricultural performance.
</P>
<P>
The technical assistance project will be carried out over a
seven-month period, beginning in April 1997.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Banks Improve Operation With Fewer Branches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The 80s were a golden period
for China's four largest banks so they started a growth war,
competing with each other to set up more branches across the
country.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, however, they've been headed in the opposite
direction, trying to reduce their numbers as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
The four largest state-owned commercial banks, the Industrial
and Commercial Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of China,
China Construction Bank, and the Bank of China (BOK), have adopted
this restructuring and commercialization strategy to redeploy
personnel, facilities, and funds to improve performance and
enhance their viability, some local experts say.
</P>
<P>
Last year, ICBC closed 1,669 offices and downsized 1,091
county-level branches, while CCB merged or completely dismantled
1,928 of its local offices.
</P>
<P>
BOK, the leader in foreign exchange in China, made a
substantial step towards internationalization, when it shut down
163 of its domestic offices which were losing money or doing
poorly.
</P>
<P>
It also opened more outlets in foreign countries to increase
its presence and numbers of overseas branches or joint ventures to
as many as 533.
</P>
<P>
ABC, once the only rural banking institution in the country,
suffered 10 billion yuan in losses in property and capital in
1996, when the government moved to further reform the rural
banking industry.
</P>
<P>
That year, the Agricultural Development Bank of China was
separated from the ABC to become a policy-oriented bank offering
government-subsidized loans for grain purchases and
poverty-relief.
</P>
<P>
The separation has meant some opportunities for ABC to
implement its long-delayed restructuring plans to turn itself into
a commercial bank, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
Last year, ABC shut down or merged over 3,000 offices in the
countryside and opened over 1,800 urban branches. "ABC will fly
high with its rural and urban wings and build a stronghold in
areas where the urban and rural come together," one ABC officer
said.
</P>
<P>
Observers point out that the banks' new strategy is the result
of the banking reforms. "Chinese bankers now judge their
operations with the eyes of merchants, not the eyes of government
officials," they explain.
</P>
<P>
Dai Xianglong, governor of the central bank, the People's Bank
of China, said at a recent national conference that banks are
special enterprises dealing in currencies and that Chinese bankers
should no longer operate a bank in the way a government
institution is run, and local governments must stop interfering in
the banks' operations. Both the interests of banks and enterprises
should be protected, he said.
</P>
<P>
While the banks, for their part, now worry more about
efficiency and plan to focus on large and medium-sized cities
where there are fewer risks and more opportunities.

<HEADLINE> HK Consumer Price Index on Rise in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Consumer Price Index (CPI) A
in Hong Kong rose 0.9 percent in December 1996 over the previous
month, according to the Census and Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
The year-on-year rates of increase in the CPI B and Hang Seng
CPI were also higher in December than in November of last year --
6.5 percent against 6.1 percent of the CPI B and 6.7 percent
against 5.8 percent for the Hang Seng CPI.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman said that the faster increases in the
CPI A and CPI B in December than in November were largely due to a
low base of comparison in the preceding year, particularly in
respect of some fresh food items and miscellaneous consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
He said that higher prices of fuel as well as higher public
housing rentals also contributed to the pick-up in consumer price
inflation.
</P>
<P>
Comparing December 1996 with November 1996, the CPI A and CPI B
increased by 0.6 percent and 0.3 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The corresponding increases for the Hang Seng CPI was 0.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
For 1996 as a whole, the CPI A and CPI B were, on average,
higher by six and 6.4 percent respectively than 1995. The
corresponding increase for the Hang Seng CPI was 6.6 percent
higher than 1995.
</P>
<P>
CPI A covers 50 percent households in the territory whose
monthly expenditures are between 3,900 and 16,000 HK dollars (503
to 2,065 US dollars); CPI B is based on the expenditure pattern of
30 percent households with expenditures between 16,000 and 28,500
HK dollars (2,064 to 3,677 US dollars); the Hang Seng CPI is based
on the expenditure pattern of 10 percent households which have
monthly expenditures ranging from 28,500 to 61,000 HK dollars
(2,064 to 7,870 US dollars).

BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The rate of 18 to 21 year olds
in Beijing undertaking higher education learning is expected to
reach 35 percent by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The increased uptake in higher learning is part of efforts to be
launched by Beijing municipal government in its drive to approach
a world advanced level in its education development, by
establishing a modern education system with rational structure by
the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Sources at a just closed Beijing education conference said
municipal education departments have mapped out a five-year
education development plan (1996-2000) for the capital.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan for the year 2000, among every 100,000
people the number by then to receive higher education will
reach 15,000, and the number of university students will reach
3,300.
</P>
<P>
The city will guarantee all school-age children with study
abilities to receive nine-year compulsory education, and the new
Beijing work force will have an average of 12 years schooling.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, 85 percent of Beijing's school students will be
receiving education in senior middle schools.
</P>
<P>
Beijing will also popularize its vocational education. The
ratio of senior school students and vocational school students
will be four to six by 2000.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, Beijing educational departments will
arrange on-the-job training and further education for three
million people every year.
</P>
<P>
In the next few years, Beijing will make major efforts to
improve the quality of teachers, increase investment for schools
and universities, and raise living standards for teachers.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Wants Permanent Membership of UN Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria on Wednesday repeated
its demand to become a permanent member of the United Nations
(UN) Security Coucil, together with Brazil and India.
</P>
<P>
The demand was voiced by the Chief of General Staff of the
armed forces, Oladipo Diya, who spoke on behalf of the Head of
State, General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
Oladipo Diya also called for the democratisation of the
Security Council, saying that it is most urgent and compelling in
view of the increasing ascendancy of nationalism and other forms
of primordial sentiments following the collapse of the bipolar
cold war era, the newspaper "Nigerian Tribune" reported today.
</P>
<P>
"The Federal Government's position is that countries such as
Nigeria, Brazil and India deserved to be co-opted as permanent
members of the council and accorded due recognition as the
dominant regional powers on whose shoulders the peace and
security of their respective regions invaribly rested," he said.
</P>
<P>
Oladipo Diya reaffirmed the Nigerian government's resolve to
continue to support and promote global peace-keeping efforts.
</P>
<P>
He said it is most paradoxical and ironic that a country like
Nigeria which is playing a major role in various peace-keeping
opeations in several parts of the world, has become the victim of
international conspracy, smear campaign and isolation.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is now sanctioned by the United States and the
European Union. It is also deprived temporarily of its membership
of the British Commonwealth. All resulted from the execution of
author Saro-Wawo and eight other leaders of the "Movement for the
Survival of the Ogonis" by the military government in November
1995.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria now plays a major role in the west African
peace-keeping force (known as ECOMOG) operating in the war-torn
Liberia.

HARBIN, January 23 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese province described as
the country's bread basket has set out to produce enough grain
to feed a city of 60 million people for a whole year.
</P>
<P>
Heilongjiang Province, Northeast China, is already playing a
vital role in supplying grain to the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The province reaped almost 30.5 billion kilograms of grain last
year, exceeding five years ahead of time a quota of 30.2 billion
kilograms set by the state for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Included was an increase of 4.54 billion kilograms of grain
over the previous year accounting for one third of China's total
amount of increased grain and able to feed a city with a
population of 10 million a year.
</P>
<P>
Experts agreed that Heilongjiang's grain growth and its
enormous production potential are of significance to China, as well
as the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Located in one of the world's three black soil belts,
Heilongjiang is known as one of China's key market-oriented grain
production bases.
</P>
<P>
It has 8.67 million hectares of farmland ranking first among
provinces in the country, 1.6 million hectares of areas suitable
for farming, and three million hectares of mountain slopes and
hilly areas ideal for development.
</P>
<P>
"Heilongjiang is China's largest strategical base for grain
reserves. Ultimately, the issue of food for the Chinese people has
to depend on Heilongjiang," Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji said during a
recent official visit to the province.
</P>
<P>
With the coldest temperatures in China and a short frost-free
period, Heilongjiang's farming used to be extensive with low
per-hectare yield.
</P>
<P>
It has introduced advanced cultivation techniques and
high-yield breeds to boost grain production in recent years.
</P>
<P>
At present, over 90 percent of the farmland in the province is
sown with improved seeds, up from 50 percent in the past.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- In the first days of the new
year, academicians from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the
Chinese Academy of Engineering were invited to give lectures on
new technology to students at the National Defense University
(NDU).
</P>
<P>
Audience members responded warmly to the lectures, which
covered such subjects as new materials and energy, space and
biological technology.
</P>
<P>
NDU President Xing Shizhong said that in the 21st century, it
will be a fundamental requirement for an army officer to master
and apply modern technology.
</P>
<P>
He noted that instead of teaching common knowledge on science
and technology, the current courses are focused on hi-tech
weaponry and its development trends as well as characteristics of
the wars of the future that will use hi-tech weapon systems.
</P>
<P>
In order to follow the development in the military hi-tech
sector, NDU sends its lecturers and researchers to other parts of
the country and abroad every year, while the school has taken
steps to improve teaching methods, Xing said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a video-network for teaching was set up at the
university. Since then, 42 documentaries about world-advanced
military technology have been broadcast.
</P>
<P>
A computerized library-based information network was formed
covering the whole campus, and all the departments have been
equipped with multi-media computers.
</P>
<P>
The university has developed 27 sets of multi-media software on
teaching theories of wars. Meanwhile, it has set up a
war-simulation building and a teaching building, according to Xing.
</P>
<P>
The construction of an advanced teaching system and a number of
language labs, multi-media lecture rooms and computerized
classrooms is underway.

The province has doubled its per unit output of rice with a
technique of drying farming and thin planting imported from Japan;
and raised the maize output from 3,000 kilograms per hectare to
7,500 kilograms, by raising the ground temperature.
</P>
<P>
A survey has shown that scientific progress has contributed 40
percent to farm production.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the province has paid attention to stabilizing the
rural policy on land contracts, while guaranteeing state grain
prices and timely purchasing of grain from farmers. This has
helped to stimulate enthusiasm among farmers for grain production.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, farmers spent over 4,000 yuan per
household on farming during the 1991-95 period, an increase of 150
percent over the previous five years.
</P>
<P>
Heilongjiang's grain output has shot up by 10.5 percent
annually over the past seven years, 7.8 percentage points higher
than the nation's average. Its increased grain output has
accounted for 19 percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of Heilongjiang's market-oriented grain has reached
64 percent, and farmers' net income now tops 2,000 yuan per person.
</P>
<P>
According to Tian Fengshan, governor of the province,
Heilongjiang is working hard to increase grain output by 7.5
billion kilograms by the end of the century, and to reach 50
billion kilograms by year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Included will be an increase of grain output amounting to 25
billion kilograms.
</P>
<P>
"By that time, the amount of increased grain will be enough to
feed a city with a population of more than 60 million for one
year," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li Youhua, professor of the Northeast China Agricultural
University and an expert in Heilongjiang's agricultural economy,
believed that although the province's farming is still subject
largely to on natural conditions, the trend toward rising grain
output will continue.
</P>
<P>
"Heilongjiang will play an increasingly significant role in the
country's grain production with the scientific progress and the
tapping of the farm potential," he added.

<HEADLINE> Privatization of Manila Waterworks Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Two Philippine firms, backed by
foreign industrial giants, today separately won the 7 billion U.S.
dollars project to privatize the Manila waterworks, the largest of
its kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS)
announced today that Ayala Corp. and Bonpres Holdings Corp. will
start to operate the MWSS on May 7 under a 25-year lease contract.
</P>
<P>
Ayala, in partnership with U.S. engineering firm Bechtel
Enterprises, Inc. and Britain's United Utilities PLC, will operate
the eastern zone of the water networks in the capital region. The
consortium formed by Benpres and France's Lyonnaise Des Eaux SA
will take over the western zone.
</P>
<P>
Public Works Secretary Gregorio Vigilar, who is also chairman
of the MWSS board, said the deal will salvage the grossly
inefficient water utility in the capital city with a population of
11 million.
</P>
<P>
About a third of households in the capital have no water
connections and have to rely on wells, public faucets or private
water vendors who charge ten times more than the MWSS rate.
</P>
<P>
On the average, water supply is available only for 16 hours a
day and could be less during the summer months from April through
June.
</P>
<P>
Under a draft concession agreement, approved in principle by
the bidders, universal access to potable water is targeted in 10
years. About 83 percent of households are expected to be connected
to sanitation and sewer facilities by the end of the concession
period, from the current level of nine percent.

GUIYANG, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Guizhou
Province has spent some 500 million yuan (60.24 million US
dollars) developing the education system in ethnic areas over the
past few years.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the provincial government show that the
province has set up 266 schools for ethnic minority students,
whose total number now exceeds two million. They account for over
33 percent of the total student number in the province, up 16.42
percent over 1990.
</P>
<P>
Guizhou is home to 12 ethnic minority groups in addition to the
Han, China's majority nationality. Ethnic population accounts for
34.7 percent of its total.
</P>
<P>
In order to develop education for ethnic groups, the province
has been trying to attract donations from developed coastal areas,
with 13 million yuan (1.57 million) coming from south China's
booming city Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the province has received 18.70 million yuan (2.25

SHANGHAI, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Media and arts organizations
in this largest commercial center in China will hold a
scriptwriting contest for shows for TV or the stage, in response
to the lack of outstanding original works.
</P>

<P>
HONG KONG, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Cathay Pacific, the biggest
airline in Hong Kong, announced today that it has ordered three
more Airbus Industrie aircraft, which will be delivered in the
last quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
David Turnbull, managing director of the airline, said, "With
the opening of Hong Kong's new airport at Chek Lap Kok in 1998, we
will have the opportunity to expand our frequencies and add new
routes, and these additional aircraft will enable us to do this."
</P>
<P>
Cathay Pacific is now operating five A340-300s, with a sixth
arriving in February 1997. An order for a further three A340-300s,
for delivery in the first half of 1998, was made in September
1996.
</P>
<P>
The A340-330s currently fly to Toronto, Zurich, Rome and
Melbourne as well as on some regional routes, and they will soon
be deployed on the Johannesburg route.
</P>
<P>
Cathay Pacific currently has a fleet of ten Airbus Industrie
A330-300s, and an eleventh will be delivered at the end of this
month. The A330-300s are deployed on regional and medium-haul
routes.
</P>
<P>
Cathay Pacific was the first airline in the world to establish
a mixed-fleet A340/A330 operation. The common design features
enable flight crews to fly both aircraft on a regular basis,
generating increased operational efficiency. The high level of
common on-board systems and structural components also streamlines
maintenance procedures.

<P>
FREETOWN, January 23 (Xinhua)-- United Nations officials here
said today that U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan ''wants a peace
keeping force of up to 700 troops and 60 unarmed observers''
deployed in Sierra Leone ''to monitor the disarmament and
demobilization of combatants'' under the terms of last November's
Abidjan peace accord.
</P>
<P>
''If the Security Council approaches the peace mission,they
could be in place within weeks,'' says Kathy Jones, Assistant to
U.N.Special Envoy Berhanu Dinka.
</P>
<P>
''The Security Council will discuss the U.N.peace mission to
Sierra Leone in the next few days, Monday at the latest,'' she
added.
</P>
<P>
Annan's request is based on the report of an assessment team
that visited Sierra Leone last December.
</P>
<P>
The blue helmeted U.N.troops will carry light arms and their
job will be supervising encampment, demobilization and reintegra-
tion of rebel fighters.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. will also monitor breaches of the ceasefire and the
force will be deployed initially for three months although the
mandate can be extended.
</P>
<P>
Both the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and the
S.Leonean government had pledged to cooperate ''fully'' on the
issue, said diplomats here.
</P>
<P>
Presidential peace envoy Sheka Mansaray said, ''Although the
Kamajors (civil defence unit) are not covered by the Abidjan
peace deal, they would also be demobilised once the war is fully
over.''
</P>
<P>
The South African mercenary group Executive Outcomes ''will be
confined to barracks and repatriated within five weeks'' of the
U.N.peace team's arrival,'' said Mansaray.
</P>
<P>
''All other foreign troops will be withdrawn by May,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Leader of the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees Delegation currently in Sierra Leone, Kolude
Doherty, told a press conference Wednesday that 90 percent of
Sierra Leone's territory ''is now relatively safe from rebel
attacks.''
</P>
<P>
Doherty, who was given the figure after talks with the Army
Chief of Staff Max Kanga, said the remaining 10 per cent of
terriory ''regarded as unsafe'' is in Kailahun in the extreme
east of the country near the Liberian border.
</P>
<P>
Kailahun, one of the largest agriculturally rich district in
the country, was the main stronghold of the RUF throughout the
six year war.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.team which is to work out ''urgent modalities'' with
Sierra Leonean officials for the repatriation of up to 380,000
Sierra leonean refugees in Guinea, Liberia and the Gambia, will
visit the interior this weekend after meeting President Tejan
Kabbah on Thursday.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Fifty containers of municipal
and soiled plastic waste stranded in Hong Kong are scheduled to
return to the Netherlands on Monday, the Hong Kong Environmental
Protection Department (EPD) said today.
</P>
<P>
"The carrier that brought the waste, around 700 tones in weight,
into Hong Kong will undertake the ship back operation," Principal
Environmental Protection Officer (Waste and Water Management) of
the EPD, Dr Ellen Chan, said.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that the waste had been stored in the original
containers and none of it was disposed of in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"The German and Dutch authorities have agreed to the return of
the waste to Rotterdam, the Netherlands. They will continue to
sort out the responsibilities and disposal arrangement of the
waste in Europe," she added.
</P>
<P>
The waste, believed to be mostly of German origin, was shipped
from the Netherlands in three separate shipments and was left
unclaimed since its arrival in Hong Kong in April last year.
</P>
<P>
"After learning of the incident in late October 1996, the EPD
has been liaising closely with the relevant authorities in
Europe," Dr Chan said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China to Select More Enterprises for Overseas Listings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- a senior securities official in
China has said that Hong Kong will continue to be the major market
for overseas listing of state-owned Chinese enterprises, and urged
selected companies to prepare well for being floated.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong will be the chief venue for overseas listing of
Chinese companies," Zhou Daojiong, chairman of the China
Securities Regulatory Commission, told a national conference on
overseas listing which ended today in Nanjing.
</P>
<P>
China will also select some enterprises for listing on stock
markets in London, Tokyo, Singapore and Australia, Zhou revealed.
</P>
<P>
He urged the fourth batch of 38 enterprises approved for
overseas listing by the Securities Committee of the State Council
late December, to formulate plans for restructuring and do a good
job in asset evaluation and financial auditing.
</P>
<P>
He also asked the enterprises to attach great importance to
information disclosure.
</P>
<P>
"You should ensure a successful stock issue by analyzing the
world capital market and entering the market at a right time," he
told representatives of selected firms.
</P>
<P>
The 38 enterprises, as many as the total in the first
three batches, do not include the 12 companies left over from
earlier selections still awaiting listing.
</P>
<P>
They cover sectors such as power, energy, transportation,
construction materials, chemicals, machinery, electronics,
medicines and household appliances.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that listing shares overseas is an important policy
for China to attract investment.
</P>
<P>
"Overseas listings have effectively helped us solve the problem
of insufficient funding for some large and medium-sized
state-owned enterprises," he said, adding they have also helped
improve the operational mechanisms and capital structure of
Chinese enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the 26 Chinese companies already
listed overseas raised a total of 4.9 billion US dollars in the
past three years, helping cut their average asset-to-liabilities
ratio to around 50 percent from over 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that overseas listings of Chinese companies have also
enabled international investors to benefit from the rapid
development of the Chinese economy, which has been growing at an
annual rate of around 10 percent for years.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the companies selected for listing are better
representative, both geographically and in terms of trades, and
reflect China's overall economic expansion and potential for
future growth.
</P>
<P>
Edgar Cheng, chairman of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong,
Anthony Neoh Q.C., chairman of the Securities &AMP; Futures Commission
of Hong Kong, experts from five overseas investment banks, and
representatives of listed companies, were among the speakers
during the four-day meeting.

<HEADLINE> FM Spokesman Calls Britain's Protest Unreasonable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- China today criticized Britain
for protesting about plans to revise and abolish British-made
changes to Hong Kong law.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign ministry said that Britain's protest on
the revision and abolition suggestions put forward by the law
panel of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) were "unreasonable and unwise, and
unacceptable to China."
</P>
<P>
Shen Guofang, foreign ministry spokesman, gave the response in
Beijing this afternoon at a press conference, in reply to a
question concerning Britain's protest on Wednesday to China's
ambassador to Britain.
</P>
<P>
The legal panel, proceeding from the stand of safeguarding the
Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, as well as Hong
Kong's smooth transition, put forward relevant suggestions, which
were practical and legitimate, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
According to Shen, the British side, ignoring China's repeated
opposition, unilaterally made major revisions on Hong Kong's
original law which are unfavorable to the territory's smooth
transition.
</P>
<P>
The legal panel, in line with the Joint Declaration and the
Basic Law, had to make suggestions for the revision and abolition
of the revised regulations which violate the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
"It leads to no where for the British side to impose its own
will on others," Shen said.
</P>
<P>
Regarding U.S's alleged concern on this matter, the spokesman
stressed that the issue of Hong Kong is a matter between China and
Britain before July 1. Then it will be China's internal affair, in
which no other country will have the right to interfere rudely,
and even less the right to make thoughtless comments disregarding
facts.

The BOI said majority of investments continued to pour in

</P>
<P>
On the other hand, investments going to the NCR were pegged at
2.07 billion dollars or 14.24 percent of the total project cost.
</P>
<P>
Among the country's 13 regions, the top choice last year was
Southern Tagalog (Region 4). The investments amounted to 773
million dollars for a total of 96 projects and generating
employment of 17,767 jobs.
</P>
<P>
Close in second was Central Luzon (Region 3) whose investments
reached 622 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Cagayan Valley (Region 2) came next with eight total projects

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 23 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's Samsung Electronics
Company has successfully developed a semiconductor chip which
integrates the functions and specifications of memory and
non-memory devices, a Samsung official announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The chip, known as merged dynamic random access memory (DRAM)
with logic 80 (MDL80), combines application specific integrated
circuit (ASIC) circuitry with 1-2 megabits in DRAM memory for
applications in computer and computer-related products.
</P>
<P>
The device avoids the delay in transmitting data between the
two types of chips. It not only improves performance, but also
reduces power consumption, the official said, adding that its mass
production will begin in March this year.
</P>
<P>
Besides computer applications, the chip can also be used in a
wide range of electronic peripheral systems including hard disk
drives, compact disc-read only memory (CD-ROM) drives and digital
video disc (DVD) players.
</P>
<P>
Samsung Electronics Company, the largest electronics firm in
South Korea, vows to continue to develop such integrated chips
with higher memory capacities and more advanced design rules of
0.35 micron, and start their commercial production as soon as
possible, the official said.

BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- China's recoverable onshore oil

request, regarding Deputy Prime Minister Drago Bilandzija, to
President Kresimir Zubak, according to reports from Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
After months of probe, Bilandzija was found having bypassed due
authorities to waive tariffs on imports worth 157 million German
marks (105 million U.S. dollars) from a Croat-controlled area.
</P>
<P>
The waiver cost the federation's government 23 million marks
(15 million dollars) in revenues.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the alleged wrongdoing by the deputy prime
minister, a Croat, and the subsequent action by the government
chief, a Muslim, would add fuel to the political tensions within
the federation.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Overseas Construction Expected to Boom in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Overseas Construction
Association of Korea (OCAK) predicted here today that South Korean
companies will earn a record 12.5 billion U.S. dollars this year
from their overseas construction businesses.
</P>
<P>
The figure, based on provisional and anticipated contracts of
65 major South Korean builders, will be up 16 percent from the
10.77 billion dollars registered last year, when the overseas
construction orders surpassed the 10-billion-dollar level for the
first time in 13 years.
</P>
<P>
"We are set to mark the nation's second 'golden age' in the
overseas construction industry," an OCAK official said, adding
that the recent upsurge in the country's construction orders have
picked up speed.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the bright outlook to the expected
booming markets in Southeast Asia and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The combined total is expected to reach 9.2 billion dollars in
the Southeast Asian market this year, up 21 percent from last
year; while that in the Middle East is expected at 1.6 billion
dollars, a whopping 73 percent rise over last year.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's overseas construction started from 1965 when the
Hyundai Construction Company won a contract worth 5 million
dollars to build an expressway in Thailand.

</P>
<P>

<P>
JERUSALEM, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Bezeq, Israel Chemicals
Ltd. and Zim Navigation Co. Ltd. will be among the first
companies to be fully privatized under a new privatization plan
unveiled today.
</P>
<P>
"We intend to sell all the profit-oriented companies," said
Government Companies Authority director-general Tzipi Livni, who
presented the list to the Ministerial Committee on Privatization
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
However, Livni did not reveal the number of firms to be sold,
the sums expected to be paid, or a timetable for the sales.
</P>
<P>
The companies that are considered ripe for sale now, some of
which are already in the first stage of privatization,
are: Bezeq Telecommunications Corp., Israel National Oil

Trade Risks Insurance Corp. Ltd., Eilat-Foreshore Development
Co. Ltd., and Arad and Dead Sea Region Development Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
"These will be sold as soon as possible," Prime Minister's
Office deputy director-general Moshe Leon said before outlining
the proposals to the committee.
</P>
<P>
A second set of companies will be tackled once it is felt they
are in a state of preparedness, including Israeli Airlines El Al
and Investment Company for Industrial Development in Israel,
Industrial Development Bank of Israel Ltd., 12 government funds,
Tadmor Hotel School Ltd., Marine Trust Ltd., Israel Bank of
Agriculture Ltd., Israel Wine Institute, Building Center of
Israel and Otzar Hashilton Hamkomi Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the large companies such as Israel Electric
Corporation and Mekorot Water Co. Ltd., Leon said their entire
industrial sector must be reformed before they could be
privatized.
</P>
<P>
The companies will be sold through public flotation on the Tel
Aviv Stock Exchange, flotations abroad, private sales of the
controlling shares, the break-up or merging of companies and
asset stripping.
</P>
<P>
The privatization plan was a major step toward realizing the
goal of economic liberalization envisioned by the current Likud
government. But due to the strong opposition from the labor
camp, the privatization process would be a slow process that
might take several years.

WEIHAI, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Almost 1,800 foreign-funded
firms have been set up in Weihai, a port city in east China's
Shandong province, latest statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Total investment by the firms has reached four billion US
dollars in the coastal city, which has taken a lead in wooing
foreign investment in the country since the opening up policy was
adopted in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The number of the firms set up by the Republic of Korea
business people increased by a large margin in 1996, the
statistics show.
</P>
<P>
The city, with the advantage of a location near to ROK,
approved 94 ROK-funded firms last year, accounting for nearly 60
percent of the total of all foreign-funded companies registered in
1996.

<HEADLINE> S. African Researchers Claim AIDS Breakthrough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 23 (Xinhua) -- South African medical
researchers claimed they have developed a medicine which has
produced far better anti-AIDS results than any existing drug on
the market, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
At a special presentation to the full cabinet meeting
Wednesday, a team of Pretoria University scientists said that a
new formula, called Virodene P058, could even pull full-blown
AIDS sufferers from the brink of death.
</P>
<P>
They said the results of preliminary trials using Virodene
P058 on about a dozen of AIDS patients over the past several
months in Pretoria have suggested a major breakthrough in the
fight against the lethal disease.
</P>
<P>
The drug is "a powerful anti-oxidant with strong anti-viral
properties," they claimed.
</P>
<P>
Scientists and some of the volunteer patients said they
believe the research give rise to fresh hopes that a cure for
AIDS might be found before the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
Their short-term prognosis is that Virodene, the chemical
composition of which is still confidential, kills the Human
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in the body and allows people
infected with HIV to live a long and normal life.
</P>
<P>
After having been briefed, the entire cabinet stood up with
great applause and decided to consider funding further research
at the request of the scientists.
</P>
<P>
Virodene was developed and had been patented by three
scientists attached to the University of Pretoria -- researcher
Olga Visser, who discovered Virodene's anti-viral properties, and
cardio-thoracic surgeons Professor Dirk du Plessis and Dr. Kallie
Landauer.

<HEADLINE> Iran: US Military Action "Remote" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Iranian general and Commander of
the Ground Forces Ahmad Dadbin has said the possibility of
military action by the United States against Iran is "remote."
</P>
<P>
His statement was published today in the front pages of all
Persian morning dailies and English daily Iran News.
</P>
<P>
Dadbin said that currently the Iranian Armed Forces are in
their best shape and ready to repel any foreign aggression.
</P>
<P>
"Considering the high combat capability and efficiency of the
armed forces, the possibility of military action by the
U.S. against Iran is remote," he said in reference to the recent
U.S. military provocations in the gulf,
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iran's parliament Wednesday approved a special fund
of 25 billion rials (8.3 million dollars) to be used to counter
any U.S. plots against Iran.
</P>
<P>
The army general said that the army's new budget has been
increased and it would be used to renovate the armed
forces. However, he gave no details.
</P>
<P>
Iran's budgetfor 1997 is expected to jump 40 percent over
1996's budget to reach 4.73 billion dollars in a bid to enhance
military capability and defuse the military threat of foreign
powers.
</P>
<P>
Iran has recently purchased a submarine from Russia at a cost
of 130 million dollars. The third Russian submarine has joined the
armed forces last month.
</P>
<P>
Dadbin said that the ground forces and the air forces will
jointly launch a grand military maneuver involving 100,000
forces in the southern regions after Ramadan, the Islamic lunar
month which started on January 10.

<HEADLINE> Manila Supports Creation of Secondary Bond Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
supports the move by the United Nations' Economic Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) to set up a secondary
bond market in the country, the Philippine News Agency reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Caridad Valdehuesa, treasurer of the Bureau of the Treasury,
said today that the proposed project would enhance the trading of
government securities in the country.
</P>
<P>
Valdehuesa noted that there is not yet an established structure
in the Philippines that undertakes the active trading of
government securities like the treasury bills and bonds, which are
available for auction at the Treasury.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission
approved the development of the secondary bond market in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was part of a technical assistance study entitled
Foreign Investments in the Philippines Stock Market, which was
made by ESCAP in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Besides the secondary bond market, the study also included the
creation of long-term debt instruments in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Dr. John Williams, chief of ESCAP's transnational division,
proposed that the project be started this month and the market be
inaugurated in October this year.
</P>
<P>
Williams said the creation of a secondary bond market will lead
to the elimination of market impediments, which will eventually
develop the capital market in the country.

<HEADLINE> Large Power Province Protects Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan
province, one of the country's major power producers, has spent
300 million yuan on 88 pollution-control projects over the past
few years.
</P>
<P>
"The province has basically realised the goal of coordinating
development of power production with environmental protection," said
a local official.
</P>
<P>
The province was the second largest coal producer in the
country and the sixth power producer in 1996. Statistics show that
the province's power capacity surpassed ten million kilowatts last
year.
</P>
<P>
The local government, facing severe pollution as a result of
increasing combustion of coal, and building of thermal power
plants, launched an overall project to protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
It worked out a series of rules and regulations, and ordered
power plants to carry out technical upgrading, helping to decrease
the discharge of waste smoke by 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Five large power plants in cities such as Zhengzhou and
Luoyang, through recycling of waste water, now can save 20 million
tons of pure water each year.
</P>
<P>
The province has also increased the utilization of coal ash to
3.2 million tons per year.

BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Qinghua University, one of
China's most prestigious academies, has joined hands with Hewlett
Packard (China) Company in establishing an electronics laboratory.
</P>
<P>
Hewlett Packard, a Sino-US joint venture, donated 35 sets of

<HEADLINE> Croats Boycotting Parliament in Muslim-Croat Federation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Croatian lawmakers in the
Assembly of the Bosnian Muslim-Croat Federation today started
boycotting parliamentary operations to press for an agreement on
power sharing with the Muslims.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by the Croatian Democratic Union of Bosnia
and Herzegovina, according to reports from Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian lawmakers have decided not to join the House of
Representatives' work until both sides reach an accord on sharing
the federation's top political positions.
</P>
<P>
The Croats took the move after the two sides, which formed the
federation in 1994, failed to solve the issue raised by the Croats
several months ago.
</P>
<P>
The Muslims argue that as incumbent president Kresimir Zubak is
a Croat, the next president of the federation should be a Muslim
as called for by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
However, the Croats fear that the Muslims will grab all powers
should the next president be a Muslim, as the chairman of the
presidency of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Republic, Alija Izetbegovic,
is already a Muslim.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Croats demand the establishment of more than a
dozen of administrative districts, including three in the
strategically important town of Mostar, where the Croats are
majorities.
</P>
<P>
They also want vacancies in the federation's cabinet to be
filled by the Croats.
</P>
<P>
All these demands have been rejected by the Muslims.
</P>
<P>
The tensions between the Croats and the Muslims have escalated
after Zubak recently accused Izetbegovic of insisting on
establishing an Islamic nation in Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> Over Half of Kuwaitis Obese: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 23 (Xinhua) -- More than half of the
710,000 Kuwaiti citizens are suffering from obesity and anemia
because of poor eating habits and other causes, according to
studies by a leading local nutritionist.
</P>
<P>
Obesity is number one health threat associated with nutrition
in Kuwait, Director of Food and Nutrition Department of the
Ministry of health Fawzia Al-Awadi said in a recent study.
</P>
<P>
According to his study, 42 percent of Kuwaiti women and 28
percent of men are obese. Twenty-eight percent of Kuwaiti men are
overweight.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of female to male in Kuwaiti population is 51:49.
</P>
<P>
Several factors contribute to the higher prevalence of
obesity in adult women, Al-Awadi said. These factors include
repeated pregnancies, rapid decline in breast feeding, an early
introduction to bottle feeding as well as poor eating habits.
</P>
<P>
She revealed that police and army personnel were more
susceptible to becoming overweight (34.4 percent) while obesity
was most prevalent among males with a technical profession.
</P>
<P>
"Regular food consumption between meals, the use of sugar in
tea, and the consumption of an additional meal at Diwaniya (men's
leisure time in chatting gathering) contributed significantly to
the development of obesity among this group," she explained.
</P>
<P>
Al-Awadi's another survey conducted among 1,154 obese patients
revealed that nearly one quarter of them had hypertension and
about 33 percent suffered diabetes.
</P>
<P>
Al-Awadi noted that "it has been shown that obesity
shortens life which is mainly due to cardiovascular and
cerebro-vascular diseases, constituting an additional risk to
overweight patients."
</P>
<P>
The nutritionist also said a large percentage of Kuwaiti
children are suffering from malnutrition due to bad feeding
habits that cause iron deficiency anemia. She said the intake
of vitamin C rich foods such as fruit juices are very low,
particularly among pre-school children.
</P>
<P>
Factors affecting the eating habits in Kuwait are income,
food prices, food import policies and the drastic change in
food formula, she reiterated. Increase in family income causes
a change in the dietary patterns that mainly are represented
by an increase in consumption of soft drinks, tea, chocolates,
sweets, nuts and ready-made foods.

<HEADLINE> Tudjman Rejects Joining Balkan Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Croatian President Franjo
Tudjman said today that Croatia would not join a Balkan political
alliance proposed by the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
"We should add a new article -- a constitutional ban on
attempts to merge Croatia with any Yugoslav or Balkan state or
federation," the 74-year-old leader told parliament in his annual
state-of-the nation speech.
</P>
<P>
The European Union-backed idea of creating a Balkan alliance
was unacceptable for Croatia because it would bring about economic
regression and destroy what Croatia has achieved since it seceded
from the former federal Yugoslavia in 1991, Tudjman was quoted as
saying by reports from Zegreb.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the Southeast European Cooperation
Initiative (SECI) proposed by the United States for economic
cooperation between the 12 Balkan countries.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. proposal would make Croatia even deeper in the
Balkans, which do not have as long historic links with Croatia as
central Europe and the Mediterranean, said the Croatian president.
</P>
<P>
However, Croatia will develop good relationship with
neighboring countries and would like to join the European Union as
an independent state, he said.
</P>
<P>
The most important events in Croatia this year, Tudjman said,
will be the elections for local administrative bodies scheduled
for March and the presidential election in the second half of the
year.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Trade Authority Granted to Chain-store Operators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has
given the authority to handle foreign trade for the first
time to 19 Chinese chain-store enterprises, it is announced in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
It is seen as an important step to help the fledgling Chinese
chain-store industry modernize and open to the outside world,
market analysts said.
</P>
<P>
According to government policies, chain store enterprises
wanting the authority to handle imports and exports must meet set
requirements, such as annual sales exceeding 100 million yuan
(12.048 million US dollars), practising a modern enterprise system
separating operations from administration, independent operation,
being responsible for their own profits and losses, and with
sufficient funds and foreign trade personnel.
</P>
<P>
The 19 enterprises that have obtained foreign trade authority
range from a supermarket, catering business and department store.
</P>
<P>
Their rights include handling their own export business, as
well as acting as export agents for other commercial enterprises.
</P>
<P>
They can also import commodities for their own use and for
other chain store distribution centers, and buy related technology.
</P>
<P>
Their rights also include engaging in processing with supplied
foreign materials, samples, and parts and components, compensation
trade, and entrepot trade.
</P>
<P>
They can also deal in grain, edible oils, foodstuffs, local
products, animal by-products, textiles, silk, garments, arts and
crafts, medicines, household electronics products, and other light
industry products.
</P>
<P>
However, they are prohibited from dealing in the export of 16
varieties of commodities and the import of 14 varieties of
commodities that are monopolized by the State.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, China had established 700 chain store
companies with 10,000 stores operating as supermarkets,
convenience shops, speciality stores, special product shops, and
warehouse-type supermarkets.

BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Jiangsu Province, an economic
power house in east China, has set up 547 enterprises abroad with
combined investment exceeding 269 million US dollars, "China
Economic Times" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Investment from Jiangsu came to 138 million US dollars,

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu to Discuss Resuming Israeli-Syrian Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 23 (Xinhua) -- As part of intensive
efforts to restart negotiations with Syria, Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu will discuss the issue during his
upcoming visit to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, in an interview with the state-run Channel 1
Television Wednesday night, said that he would discuss with
U.S. President Bill Clinton some "bridging proposals" to serve
as the basis for resuming talks with Syria when he visits
Washington in the first week of February.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli leader expressed confidence that his Washington
visit would "speed up" the resumption of negotiations with
Damascus, which broke off a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the remarks after Foreign Minister David Levy
suggested earlier Wednesday that one basis for resuming the talks
could be U.N. Resolution 242 which calls for Israeli withdrawal
from occupied Arab territories to forge peace.
</P>
<P>
The last Likud government recognized the resolution as the
basis for the invitation to the 1991 Madrid peace conference, but
neither the then government nor the Netanyahu government had ever
said that 242 would be the basis for talks about the Golan
Heights.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel's previous Labor government did state this
during its first round of talks with Syria. Netanyahu has has
called for talks with Syria without preconditions.
</P>
<P>
Syria has rejected repeated calls by Netanyahu government for
resuming talks without preconditions, insisting that the talks
only be restarted after Israel pledges to return the Golan
Heights.
</P>
<P>
In response to Levy's remarks, Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Shara told Radio Monte Carlo Wednesday that Israel's call for
talks was nothing new. He demanded that negotiations be picked up
"where they left off."
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Clinton, Netanyahu is also expected
to discuss the future talks with the Palestinian Authority (PA),
including the controversial issue of the Palestinian independence.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu told Channel 1 that he would not allow the PA to
unilaterally declare statehood. But PA President Yasser Arafat,
speaking in Cairo after meeting with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak Wednesday, declared that he would do so after the
final-status talks with Israel.

<HEADLINE> Top Academy Cultivates Top-rated Scholars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- A leading think-tank academy in
China has launched a plan to ensure it can nurture the country's
cream of academics for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The prestigious Chinese Academy of Social Sciences has devised
a program to ensure that it will have enough efficient researchers
on its staff in the coming years, sources said.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the academy, which acts as a think tank for the
central government, told Xinhua that the academy has selected the
first group of 160 candidates under the age 50 who will be potential
leading figures in their particular spheres around the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 top-rated researchers will be cultivated for the
next century, according to the plan.
</P>
<P>
The academy has also built archives for a number of young and
middle aged researchers who will take over the administration of
the academy in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Its door has been opened wider to talented people who want to
do research in the academy, an ivory tower in the old days.
</P>
<P>
Built in 1977, the academy has the top seat in the country's
liberal arts and social sciences. It's pride has faced threats in
the past few years as promising young scholars quit the academy
for more lucrative jobs.
</P>
<P>
Many methods have been adopted to re-shape the institute's
glory, including providing young researchers with more academic
opportunities and improving their living conditions.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 169 scholars under the age of 50 were approved to
enter the panels having the right to give senior academic titles
to researchers, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
More young scholars were sent abroad for study last year, and
the number will continue to grow. By 2000, a total of 300
researchers will study overseas, accounting more than 10 percent
of the total researchers in the academy.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Manufacturing Growth Expected to Moderate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's manufacturing
output is expected to grow by 12.5 percent this year, slightly
down from 12.8 percent in 1996, International Trade and Industry
Minister Rafidah Aziz said today.
</P>
<P>
However, the sector's share in the gross domestic product (GDP)
is forecast to go up to 36.0 percent from 34.5 percent last year,
Rafidah said at a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
He said that manufacturing continued to play a leading role in
the country's economic growth in 1996 after it posted a strong
14.5-percent growth rate and a 33.1-percent GDP share in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The moderation was due to slower growth of some export-oriented
industries, particularly electronics, with a softening demand
worldwide, said Rafidah.
</P>
<P>
The electrical, electronics and machinery industry recorded a
steep decline in its growth, down to 9.9 percent in the first 10
months of 1996 from 20.9 percent one year ago, although it
remained the biggest contributor to the manufacturing output,
accounting for 48 percent of the total growth.
</P>
<P>
Strong output in the export-oriented industries was led by the
wood and wood products industry (15 percent), followed by the
rubber products industry (10.7 percent) and the textiles industry
(10.3 percent).
</P>
<P>
Output of the domestic market-oriented industries also remained
robust, underpinned by capacity expansion and increased demand.
</P>
<P>
Exports of manufactured goods are valued at an estimated 156.1
billion ringgit (about 62.44 billion U.S. dollars) or 81.0 percent
of Malaysia's total exports in 1996, compared with 147.5 billion
ringgit (about 59 billion U.S. dollars) or 79.7 percent of the
total in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"This was despite a lower rate of growth of exports of 5.8
percent in 1996 against 22.9 percent in 1995. The lower growth
rate was due to a slack in overseas demand for electrical and
electronic products, large inventories as well as increased price
competition in the global market," Rafidah said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Malaysia's manufacturing sector is undergoing
structural shifts towards a focus on higher value-added segments,
with a growing trend of capital-intensive projects which involve
higher levels of technology and skills.
</P>
<P>
According to official estimates, the manufacturing sector
generated 157,400 additional jobs in 1996 compared with 159,500 in
1995.
</P>
<P>
The country's real GDP is expected to grow at a steady rate of
eight percent this year with continuing favorable economic
environment both at home and abroad, Rafidah said.

<HEADLINE> 45 Five-Star Hotels Built in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- China now has more than 3,700
hotels designed for overseas tourists, with a total of 486,000
rooms, among which 45 are five-star hotels, according to the China
National Tourism Administration (CNTA).
</P>
<P>
The hotels are worth 25 billion US dollars in terms of fixed
assets and have an annual income of 63.6 billion RMB yuan, a press
conference held to mark Hotel China '97 was told by a CNTA
official today.
</P>
<P>
As China's tourism industry has been growing at an annual rate
of 20 percent a year since 1979, the number of foreign tourists
visiting China reached 50 million in 1996, with foreign exchange
incomes from tourists surpassing ten billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Domestic tourism by Chinese citizens is also developing
vigorously with the number of domestic tourists going up, and 164
billion yuan earned in income last year.
</P>
<P>
To cope with China's booming tourism industry, CNTA, together
with the China World Trade Center Company, will host a hotel
exhibition at the China World Trade Center in late November 1997.
</P>
<P>
The exposition, the largest of its kind in China, will feature
up-to-date hotel and restaurant products, food and beverage
processing and packaging equipment from over 20 countries, such as
the United States, France, Britain, Germany, Japan, the Republic
of Korea and Italy as well as the Hong Kong and Taiwan regions.

<HEADLINE> Former Afghan President in Tehran for Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Former Afghan President and
leader of the National Liberation Front Sebghatollah Mojaddadi
arrived here Wednesday night for peace talks with warring
factions in Afghanistan, Iran's official news agency IRNA
reported today.
</P>
<P>
IRNA said that all Afghan groups are to meet in Tehran early
next week in the presence of a U.N. representative to explore the
ways and means of forging peace in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival in Tehran, Mojaddadi condemned foreign
intervention in Afghanistan and said the current unrest in that
country was the result of that intervention.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident major and quick steps would be taken towards
the resolution of the Afghan crisis," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mojaddadi became head of the interim government in Kabul in
1992 after the fall of the Soviet installed government led by
Najibullah.
</P>
<P>
Iran has also invited Pakistan and the Taliban for the peace
conference. However, the official report did not specify the
date for the conference.
</P>
<P>
Mojaddadi said that "Pakistan plays a great role in solving the
 Afghan problem, and in fact holds the key to the dilemma. Some
3.5 million Afghans have taken refuge in Pakistan, though some
have returned."
</P>
<P>
"Furthermore, Pakistan has played a role in Afghan affairs
since the very beginning of the Muslim Afghan people's Jihad
against the Soviet occupation forces," he added.

<HEADLINE> China's First Bank for Housing to be Set Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, January 23 (Xinhua) -- China's first bank
designed to assist ordinary people in buying a home will be set
up in north China's Hebei Province later this year.
</P>
<P>
The Housing Bank, a specialized bank under the supervision of
the People's Bank of China, the nation's central bank, according
to the Provincial Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
The bank will be charged with pooling funds which the
enterprises and institutions reserve for the purchase of
apartments. It will also provide loans to individuals and savings
services related to home-buying.
</P>
<P>
More than ten billion yuan was spent on building commercial
apartments in the province last year. Over three million square m
of commercial apartments were completed, but only 1.92 million
square m of them were sold.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the stereotyped housing welfare system, the lack
of financial service is one of the major factors that have
affected the people's power to buy apartments, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are few housing loans for individuals, and
they are short-term and have a high interest rate. The new
housing bank will give more priority to individual housing
loans.

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The per capita GDP figure

of 13.5 percent over 1995 in terms of comparable prices. Per
capita GDP in 1996 exceeded 5,300 yuan.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with Deng Xiaoping's plan to revitalize the

Meanwhile, the province's supervision department and tax
department organized inspection teams to go to localities to dig
out cases of violation cases.

<P>
MANILA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government troops
today suspended their operations against rebels in Lantawan,
Mindanao, to allow Muslims in the southern Philippines to observe
Ramadhan without disturbance.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine News Agency quoted Brigade Commander Rodolfo
Vasquez as saying that government troops stopped hot pursuit
operations against the extremist Abu Sayyaf rebel group in
deference to the observance of the month-long fast by Muslims in
this month of Ramadhan.
</P>
<P>
The suspension of operations will allow the rebels to continue
with their fast without being bothered or displaced by operations
in the area, he said.
</P>
<P>
Operations against the Abu Sayyaf in the area started late last
month following the beheading of two traders by the rebel group.
</P>
<P>
But while the military has been pursuing the armed group, there
were no serious encounters because the rebels were "quite elusive"
and avoided "confrontation" with soldiers, the brigade commander
said.
</P>
<P>
As of early this week, reports say some 1,000 families have
fled the Lantawan region to prevent themselves from being caught
in the crossfire.

<HEADLINE> China to Step Up Reform of State Arts Troupes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- China's Culture Minister Liu
Zhongde today urged 2,600 arts troupes nationwide to carry out
reforms that can enable them to survive in the market economic
environment.
</P>
<P>
The minister was speaking at a national meeting to discuss the
now-outdated measures of the planned economy under which the arts
management and operations systems were formed.
</P>
<P>
These troupes have been facing many difficulties, Liu said,
such as heavy financial burdens, a shrinking market, and a lack
of competitive spirit, which all have hindered the artists'
creativity and threatened the troupes' survival.
</P>
<P>
It is high time to reform all of these areas, he noted, as
shown by the country's successful experiment last year to reform
more than ten national troupes.
</P>
<P>
Some sluggishly-operating troupes were merged or disbanded, and
some 900 unqualified performers were not re-hired after failing an
examination included in last year's reform.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that the reform objective in the coming years is to
create a brand new management and operations system for the arts
sector, which can stay in line with a socialist market economy,
meet the requirements of socialist ethical and cultural progress,
and be governed by the laws of culture itself.
</P>
<P>
There will be three main tasks, he said.
</P>
<P>
First, to improve the distribution by reducing the number of
the troupes in some regions, particularly in big cities, while
forming some new troupes according to the practical situations.
</P>
<P>
Second, a mechanism system must be put in place that can ensure
that efficient artists are deservedly recognized and the
inefficient are ousted from the arts market. To do this, an
examination and re-employment system will be introduced.
</P>
<P>
Finally, troupes should make profit by giving good
performances, and should raise money from society, in addition to
receiving government funding.

<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Overseas-funded firms in east
China's Anhui Province handed over 350 million yuan in taxes to
the state in the first ten months of 1996, an amount more than
figure for all of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Officials attributed the increase to the introduction of
state-of-the-art technology and equipment by the enterprises,
which raised the competitive level of the goods in the domestic
market.
</P>
<P>
The Rongshida Group, cooperating with Japan's Sanyo, has
produced brand-name washing machines, which are selling well in
both China and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-backed enterprises have also promoted Anhui's
exports. In the first ten months of 1996, these enterprises had
earned profits totalling 220 million US dollars, up 43.2 percent
from the corresponding period of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Anhui actually utilized 667 million US dollars of
foreign investment, accounting for 9.6 percent of the province's
investment in fixed assets.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-funded enterprises also have provided job opportunities
to the province. At present, the enterprises employ 200,000
workers,
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has set the introduction of more
foreign investment as a major goal for the 1996-2000 period.

residents living in secluded mountainous areas.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, the province has developed its silk and forestry
industries, bred fish and domestic animals, planted fruit, tea and
other cash crops, and also mined minerals.
</P>
<P>
These undertakings generated an output value of 3.5 billion
yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the poverty-stricken population in the province
has been reduced to 2.46 million from 4.5 million in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Mountains, marshland and areas near reservoirs have made it
difficult for Jiangxi people to obtain adequate grain supplies.
</P>
<P>
By carrying out research into wet areas surrounding the Poyang
Lake, agro-technicians have found an effective way of planting
high-yield rice on 66,000 hectares of marshland.
</P>
<P>
Planting of bamboo is also an effective remedy for eliminating
poverty in Jiangxi. Last year, the output value from bamboo in
Jinggangshan Mountain, an old revolutionary base, rose to 27
million yuan (about 3.25 million US dollars), which meant per
capita income reached 300 yuan.
</P>
<P>
To popularize science and technology, the province held 40,000
training courses over the past decade, providing college education
to 130,000 indigent farmers.

<HEADLINE> India Tightens Import of Plastic Wastes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government has
banned import of used plastic in the form of waste or scrap in
order to contain pollution and prevent damage to the environment,
the Hindustan Times said today.
</P>
<P>
The norms governing import of plastic waste or scrap have been
tightened so as to allow arrival of only virgin material, the
processing of which does not result in generation of effluents.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent government decision, all consignments of
plastic or scrap coming into the country would be subject to
scrutiny to verify if they contain any toxic or hazardous
substance.
</P>
<P>
The testing procedures would be applicable for each and every
shipment, even if many of them are imported together by one party.
</P>
<P>
The importers concerned will also have to file a declaration
stating that the plastic waste or scrap imported by them is free
of any toxic or hazardous material which would increase pollution
and damage the environment.
</P>
<P>
Persons found to be misdeclaring the nature of the consignments
would be prosecuted under the law.
</P>
<P>
A certificate from the factory where the waste-scrap was
generated indicating that it conforms to the government norms will
also be necessary.

<HEADLINE> China Regulates Compulsory Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The State Education Commission
(SEC) has reaffirmed that all primary and middle schools are
responsible for popularizing nine-year compulsory education and
offering basic education.
</P>
<P>
In a newly-released document, the (SEC) said that it is
governments at all level who provide compulsory
education. Therefore it is the duty of governments to guarantee
investment in compulsory education according to law, and to
promote more quality-emphasized education rather than
test-oriented education.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese law, compulsory education is free and
includes nine years of primary and junior middle school
instruction.
</P>
<P>
The SEC also asked all governments to effectively improve
conditions of poorly-run schools, both in terms of the facilities
and the quality of teachers.
</P>
<P>
All state-owned primary and middle schools should charge no
tuition fees, the document states, and students should go to
schools which are near their homes and receive equal education
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
These schools are forbidden to enroll students who wish to come
from outside the designated school zones, as the schools could
then charge fees for receiving students from other communities.
</P>
<P>
"If some parents and students do wish to choose a better
school, state-owned schools should introduce them to
non-state-owned schools," said the SEC in the document. But the
practice of "one school, two systems" is banned and must be
strictly enforced.
</P>
<P>
The SEC decreed that all schools across the country must cancel
entrance examinations to junior middle schools, and students must
attend schools close to their homes for a three-year period.
</P>
<P>
SEC said that the government will continue to support
non-state-owned schools and offer guidance to them.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Navy Ready to Help Deport Illegals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Defense
Ministry is prepared to provide Royal Malaysian Navy (RMN) ships
to deport illegal immigrants, if necessary, although their status
differed from that of refugees.
</P>
<P>
So far the government has not directed the ministry to do so
but the matter might be raised at the National Security Council
meeting, Defense Minister Syed Hamid Albar said last night at the
RMN base in Lumut, some 290 kilometers north of here, according to
Malaysia's official news agency Bernama today.
</P>
<P>
There are about 2 million foreign workers in Malaysia of which
more than half are illegal immigrants mainly from Indonesia,
Bangladesh and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian authorities have stepped up efforts to curb
further inflows of illegal immigrants, but still many are trying
to sneak into the country.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian Armed Forces (ATM) has joined hands with the
police in preventing the entry of illegal immigrants through the
border and the sea.
</P>
<P>
"This is in line with the resolution of the National Security
Council that the ATM and police embark on an integrated approach
in handling the attempts by illegal immigrants to enter the
country through the border and the sea," he said.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said although the power of arrest with regard to
the illegal entry by immigrants is vested in the police,
nonetheless, it is important for the armed forces and the police
to carry out operations on an integrated basis to stamp out such
entry.
</P>
<P>
On crackdown against illegals in border areas, he said the
armed forces had hauled up more than 200 illegal immigrants since
Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
The biggest success was the rounding up of 100 Bangladeshis at
the Malaysia-Thai border while the rest were detained in the
states of Johor, Melaka (Malacca) and Negeri Sembilan, he said.
</P>
<P>
The army had been ordered to mount operations in Johor, Negeri
Sembilan, Melaka and the Malaysia-Thai border as there were
forward bases in these areas.
</P>
<P>
Such operations would continue including deploying RMN ships
and Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) aircraft for sea and air
surveillance, he said.

<HEADLINE> Ports Spring up in Beibu Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, January 23 (Xinhua) -- A group of modernized ports have
been built along the Beibu Gulf -- the stretch of water between
Vietnam and China's island province of Hainan -- with a total
annual handling capacity topping 40 million tons.
</P>
<P>
These ports are the Zhanjiang Port, in Guangdong Province;
Qinzhou, Fangcheng and Beihai ports in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region; and Haikou, Yangpu and Basuo ports in Hainan Province.
</P>
<P>
The Port of Zhanjiang, one of the eight largest ports in the
country, has a yearly handling capacity reaching 18 million tons,
with 23 10,000-ton-plus berths. The port is currently able to
accommodate four 300,000-ton cargo-carriers or 500,000 oil-tanks
at the same time.
</P>
<P>
The three ports of Guangxi have a total annual handling
capacity of 10 million tons. Among them, Fangcheng Port is one of
the key ports of the country. Its annual capacity has surged 30
percent in recent years to climb above five million tons in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to build Qinzhou Port into the largest of
its kind in Guangxi, intending to make the most of the province's
geographic advantages, while Beihai Port is expected to focus on
passenger transport, container transport, and handling
non-pollution cargos.
</P>
<P>
The three ports plan to expand their handling capacity to 25
million tons by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The three ports in Hainan have a total handling capacity of
more than 10 million tons. The capacity of the Haikou Port
increased by 16.2 percent to reach 4.45 million tons in the first
ten months of 1996.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Invest Heavily in Infrastructure, Key Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's largest
industrial center, is to invest trillions of yuan to build
infrastructure projects and key industries in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
To maintain its sustained economic development, the city plans
to earmark 45 billion yuan for an information technology program
over the next 15 years, the "China Economic Times" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Development of the Pudong New Area will absorb more domestic
and overseas funds, but the exact amount is currently unavailable.
</P>
<P>
The city's planned investment in fixed assets in the
Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) will be one trillion yuan.
</P>
<P>
One third of the investment will go to infrastructure projects
in urban districts. Work has started on the construction of an
international airport at the Pudong New Area, as well as a second
subway line, a deep-water harbor and a highway that circles within
the city.

heavily-polluted Suzhou River, which runs through the city proper,
and to build a green belt around the city.
</P>
<P>
As the living standards of both urban and rural residents have
improved, there is a clear need to expand living space, so the
city will build new houses with a total floor space of 10 million
sq. m. annually for the next four years.

<HEADLINE> Street of Harmonious Mothers- and Daughters-in-law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Family harmony stretches down a
100-meter-long street in Dalian, where 30 pairs of mothers- and
daughters-in-law have bucked the traditional Chinese stereotype
and know how to get along.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 families live on Zhichengnanyijie Street in the city,
the largest northern seaport in China's Liaoning Province, and at
least one member from each household works at the Dalian
Locomotive Plant.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Guiying's family illustrates such goodwill. The
76-year-old woman, neatly dressed and smiling, says,
"Understanding is always a family rule."
</P>
<P>
She says that for years her bedridden husband has been cared
for by their daughter-in-law. Zheng's son and daughter-in-law gave
their elders their large bedroom, which is cool in the summer and
sunny in winter.
</P>
<P>
As Zheng has lost most of her teeth, her daughter-in-law often
buys fresh strawberries and tomatoes which are easy to chew.
</P>
<P>
A neighborhood public worker pointed out that Zheng's
circumstances are no different from those of the other senior
residents who live on the street. "The family's best bedroom must
be for the old, and the color TV set is placed in their rooms."
</P>
<P>
Zheng says she was mistreated by her own mother-in-law when she
was young, but she has never sought to perpetuate abuse and took
care of her mother-in-law in her old age.
</P>
<P>
She has set a good example for the neighborhood's married women.
</P>
<P>
In some areas, an informal rule has been gradually set under
which newly-married daughters-in-law are taken to visit each
family on their husband's street, in order to get a better sense
of the relatives' feelings for each other.
</P>
<P>
Gao Guizhi, 78, says she has never argued with her five
daughters-in-law during her ten years' stay with them.
</P>
<P>
Her youngest daughter-in-law, Rong Lianyu, who works at the
electric transformer substation in Dalian Locomotive Plant, says,
"I have taken her as my own mother, just the same as my four
sisters-in-law have done."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Firm Plans to Handle Garbage Disposal in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHAMDNU, January 23 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. company is planning to
solve the garbage disposal problem in major Nepali cities under
joint efforts with local municipalities, the local press said
today.
</P>
<P>
Americorp Environmental Services (AES) Group Inc. announced
here on Wednesday that it had plans to help Kathmandu and other
major cities in the country rid off their perennial problem of
garbage disposal by building modern landfill sites.
</P>
<P>
The American company has already signed letters of intent with
three cities including Kathmandu for such joint ventures which are
expected to cost about 12 to 18 million U.S. dollars each, company
officials disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Such operations in selected areas could start as early as March
this year if things move as planned, they said.
</P>
<P>
The AES planned landfill sites will incorporate double layer
liners which could prevent garbage from seeping into nearby ground
water reservoirs, the company said.
</P>
<P>
According to the company, profits will come from sales of
recycled plastic, energy generated from the garbage and the
eventual compost processed from organic waste.

<HEADLINE> EU's Lower Tariff Seen as Barrier to Thai Rice Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Thai rice exporters will not
benefit much from the European Union's agreement to apply this
year's lower import tariff on Thai broken rice under last year's
unused quota.
</P>
<P>
However, the EU's decision, because of its time constraints, is
seen as a barrier.
</P>
<P>
To benefit from the lower tariff under the carried-over quota
of 12,000 tons, Thai exporters and EU importers must complete all
necessary paperwork by the end of this month and deliveries be
completed by the end of March, according to a Thai Commerce
Ministry source.
</P>
<P>
The time constraint meant that Thai exporters are unlikely to
fill the low-tariff quota and the benefits would be small.
</P>
<P>
A source at the Rice Exporters' Association of Thailand said
the 28 ecu-margin between the normal and lower tariffs was not
attractive to buyers or sellers, considering the time-consuming
procedures at both ends of the deliveries.
</P>
<P>
Tariff on Thai rice within this year's quota is 148 ECUs
(European currency units), or 4,884 baht (195 US dollars),
compared with this year's regular tariff of 176 ECUs, or 5,808
baht (232 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The lower duty is to compensate Thailand for the loss of free
rice access to three countries that joined the EU in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thai Commerce Minister Narongchai Akrasanee is
scheduled to visit Brussels next week to ask the EU to lift
controls on Thai rice and to raise with the EU a dispute about the
calculation of import tariffs on Thai fragrant rice.

NEW DELHI, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Eight more Indian
politicians, including former Haryana chief minister Bhajan Lal,
were charged on Wednesday by the Central Bureau of Investigation
(CBI) for their alleged involvement in a bribery case, the local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
By filing the fresh charges, the CBI brought its investigation
in the 3.5 crore rupees (about one million U.S. dollars) bribery
case to a logical conclusion.
</P>
<P>
The sensational case also involves former prime minister P.V.
Narasimha Rao who was accused of paying some members of parliament
for voting in favor of his government in a crucial vote of
confidence on July 28, 1993.
</P>
<P>
The CBI has issued charge sheets against Rao and some other
politicians earlier.
</P>
<P>
In its fresh charge sheets issued on Wednesday, the CBI accused
the eight politicians of either bribing or receiving bribes
relating to the vote of confidence on July 28, 1993.
</P>
<P>
Further hearing of the case will be on January 24.

<HEADLINE> Germany to Kill Cows From Britain, Switzerland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 22 (Xinhua) -- German federal and state
governments today agreed to butcher and incinerate all of the
5,000 cows coming from Britain and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The decision was reached after an urgent meeting held today in
Bonn. It is first move taken by Germany since the first case of
"mad cow" disease was found more than two years ago. The
government will offer a compensation of 1,500-2,000 German marks
(1,000-1,333 U.S. dollars) to farmers for each cow slaughtered.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture announced Tuesday that in the end
of last year a young bull, progeny of a British cow, was
slaughtered because of nerve obstruction and was later diagnosed
as Bovine Sopongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) by the Federal
Institute of Animal Infectious Diseases.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said heredity from the female parent or BSE
virus-infected forage might be the cause.
</P>
<P>
Granz-Josef Feiter, a senior official from the ministry told
reporters today after the meeting that so far there was no
definite answer how the bull was infected.
</P>
<P>
He added the latest examination showed mother of the bull,
having given birth to a normal bull earlier in Holland, is
"obviously healthy." The cow had been slaughtered without BSE
symptom.
</P>
<P>
Feiter ruled out the possibility for cows in Germany being
infected with BSE virus by forage.
</P>
<P>
The young bull will be the first case of being infected with
the virus through heredity if it is confirmed.
</P>
<P>
The urgent meeting also decided that the government supervise
all the about 14,000 young bulls of British or Swiss mother cows.
Further moves won't be taken until the inspection result comes out
whether bulls could be infected through heredity.

<HEADLINE> Weather Forecasting Aids Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- State Councillor Song Jian
yesterday called for heightened development of China's
meteorological service, which is playing an increasing role in the
growth of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
"The China Meteorological Administration (CMA) and its local
agencies played a key role in helping fight against last year's
weather-related disasters -- particularly last summer's floods --
by providing timely forecasting that helped reduce damage caused
by such calamities," today's "China Daily" quoted Song as saying
at a national conference yesterday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Song said he hopes meteorological staff will further improve
their forecasting services.
</P>
<P>
Song noted that this year, "top forecasting priority must be
given to China's agriculture -- particularly grain production --
because good harvests throughout the country still rely on
favorable meteorological conditions."
</P>
<P>
Improvements are expected to include a medium-range forecasting
system known as "T-106" that is capable of predicting weather
changes earlier than standard techniques, said Wen Kegang, top
official with CMA.
</P>
<P>
This system, and the use of super-computers, will help the
nation maintain top global levels in weather forecasting.
</P>
<P>
Such systems are expected to provide more effective warnings
about approaching rainstorms or typhoons that might pose serious
threats to many parts of China's economy, Wen added.
</P>
<P>
Also planned this year are a series of projects to monitor
changes in the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
To help reduce possible damage by regional weather-related
disasters, Wen pledged that CMA will further improve a
computer-based system offering forecasting to local officials.
</P>
<P>
The system has been linked with more than half of China's local
authorities at prefectural levels and is to be extended to most
leading government officials this year, Wen indicated.

<HEADLINE> Bonn to Cut Income Taxes to Boost Job Creation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The German Government will cut
income taxes to boost job creation for Germany's unemployment-hit
economy.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Theo Waigel said Wednesday that Germany's
ruling coalition has struck a deal to cut income taxes under a
major tax reform intended to take effect by 1999.
</P>
<P>
Waigel did not give details, but sources from the policy group
said a compromise model had been agreed between Waigel's wish to
keep Germany's sliding tax scale and the call by junior coalition
partner Free Democrats (FDP) for a low entry rate.
</P>
<P>
The new tax model would start with a flat rate of 15 percent on
annual income of between 13,000 (about 8,000 U.S. dollars) and
20,000 marks (about 12,000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The rate would then jump to 22 percent and rise to a top rate
of 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
The new tax model would cut income taxes sharply from today's
entry rate of 26 percent and top rate of 53 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the income tax cuts, corporation taxes would
fall to 35 percent from 47 percent now. The corporate tax changes
will take effect from the start of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a slew of tax breaks would be abolished to make the
German tax system more simple and effective. Waigel has said that
taxpayers would be 25 billion marks better off at the end of the
day.
</P>
<P>
Government leaders want the lower income tax rates to boost job
creation after unemployment hit a post-war record of over 4.1
million in December which is seen as a threat to efforts to cut
borrowing and qualify this year for European monetary union.
</P>
<P>
The tax policy group was due to finalize its work by Wednesday
evening. Chancellor Helmut Kohl will chair a meeting of chiefs
from his three-party coalition Thursday to set the seal on the tax
package.

<HEADLINE> Belarus President on Principles of Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Belarus must preserve its
sovereignty when it enters into alliances with other nations, says
Belarus President Exlexander Lukashenko.
</P>
<P>
Itar-Tass News Agency reported today that in an interview with
the country's state television, Lukashenko described this as the
first of the three principles his country should follow when
entering into the closest political and economic relationships
with other countries.
</P>
<P>
Belarus would never merge with other countries, as a province
or a region, Lukashenkp said.
</P>
<P>
The second principle was that Belarus citizens should never
join wars that happened in the hot spots of other countries.
</P>
<P>
Belarus' alliances with other countries should be of mutual
benefit, Lukashenko said. This was the third principle.
</P>
<P>
During the interview, Lukashenko stressed the importance of the
country's relations with Russia and reaffirmed his determination
to create a close alliance with Russia.
</P>
<P>
"We will never change our policy towards Russia, no matter who
oppose and how they oppose it", Lukashenko said.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko has favored closer alliance with Russia since he
became president in July, 1994.
</P>
<P>
Belarus and Russia have had a good relationship since the
dissolution of the former Soviet Union, and began speeding up an
alliance process in 1995.

<HEADLINE> More Evacuees Return to Indonesia's Merapi Volcano </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- A total of 2,126 people who had
fled home following a major eruption of Mt. Merapi last week
returned home on Wednesday, reports said here today.
</P>
<P>
The 2,968-meter high volcano, located on the border of Central
Java and Yogyakarta, erupted last Friday, forcing the evacuation
of some 15,000 villagers around the mountain. They had since been
accommodated at a number of barracks.
</P>
<P>
Most of the evacuees had returned home on Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
There was no official news on casualties but unconfirmed
reports said six people went missing last Friday when Merapi
erupted.
</P>
<P>
Suranto, an official of the Mt. Merapi surveillance post in
Kaliurang, said last night that although the evacuees had been
allowed to return home, they were asked to keep vigilance against
the possible danger of heat clouds as the volcano remained on an
"alert" status.
</P>
<P>
Head of Yogyakarta's Merapi Research Center Mas Atje
Purbawinata said the alert status of the volcano was applied
within a radius of 6,000 meters from its peak.
</P>
<P>
The last major eruption of the volcano occurred in 1994,
sending massive heat clouds all over the area, killing 69 people
and leaving 5,000 homeless.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's 17,500 islands are dotted with about 500 volcanoes,
127 of which are active and make up the Pacific rim of fire.

<HEADLINE> Romania Takes Measures to Control Currency Devaluation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Finance Minister
Mircea Ciumara said Wednesday that the government will strengthen
the management of the foreign currency market to control the
devaluation of Romania's lei.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate is to be set at one U.S. dollar to 5,500 lei,
Ciumara told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Lei has devaluated sharply since the beginning of this year,
dropping from 4,143 lei to one dollar on January 6 to 5,612 to one
on January 22.
</P>
<P>
The devaluation, which was attributed to the unsuccessful
economic reform, the increase of foreign trade deficit and the
poor management of the foreign currency market, have led to a new
round of inflation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate in 1996 was 50 percent, much higher than the
government-set target. The foreign trade deficit of the year
amounted to 2 billion dollars, 800 million dollars more than that
of 1995.

JAKARTA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
helped to raise 3.3 million people above the poverty line through
poverty eradication programs between 1993 and 1996, a senior

<HEADLINE> Russia Still Against NATO's Expansion Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said today that Russia is still firmly against the
planned eastward expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Primakov, who held talks with visiting NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana early this week, made clear that an improved
relationship between Russia and NATO could not be viewed as
Russia's acquiescence to the alliance's plan.
</P>
<P>
Russia stood and stands against the enlargement of NATO on
geopolitical, military and moral-psychological grounds, Primakov
said at a closed-door meeting with lawmakers of the Russian
Federation Council, the upper house.
</P>
<P>
"We fear that (expansion) will create new dividing lines in
Europe. And we have grounds for concern," the foreign minister
added.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped Russia's concern could be dispelled through
further negotiations between Russia and NATO.
</P>
<P>
When talking about his Monday's meeting with Solana, Primakov
said, "We have embarked on a serious dialogue and we will pursue
it further."
</P>
<P>
During their five-hour meeting, Primakov and Solana failed to
reach any agreement on the expansion issue.
</P>
<P>
NATO is expected to accept the Czech Republic, Hungary and
Poland as its new members at a July summit in Madrid, Spain.

<HEADLINE> Canada Sees Retail Sales Rise in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Canada's retail sales continued to
increase in November as consumers spent more on big-ticket items,
Statistics Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
In November, retail sales rose 0.9 percent to 13.6 billion U.S.
dollars, following a 1.3-percent increase in October.
</P>
<P>
Automobiles, furniture and other durable goods accounted for most
of the growth in retail sales thanks to the low level of interest rate
in decades, said the federal fact-gathering agency.
</P>
<P>
Sales in the automobile sector advanced for the fourth consecutive
month in 1996, led by motor vehicle and recreational vehicle dealers.
</P>
<P>
The growth in the furniture sector offset the decrease in October.
Yet, furniture sales are still below the peak reached in December
1994, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Sales in the general goods sector increased for the second
consecutive months, which more than offset declines in August and
September.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that in the month Canadians spent less on clothing
and food. Clothing sales were 2.5 percent smaller from January to
November than the previous period in 1995, while food sales dropped
2.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> CCPIT Works to Improve Nation's Overseas Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- China Council for the Promotion
of International Trade (CCPIT) has done much in promoting trade
relations between China and the United States and between China's
inland and Taiwan Province, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing based English newspaper quoted Council Chairman Guo
Dongpo as saying that due to its efforts, five Chinese trade
delegations were able to visit the United States, clarifying
interested Americans' views of China and lobbying for the US
government to act in favour of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Guo said, in 1996, the council played host to more than 40
trade delegations from the United States. The two-way visits
helped to mend fences when the two countries spent a turbulent
year in bilateral trade ties.
</P>
<P>
Last October, four delegations featuring trade, tea, retailing
and property development visited Taiwan Province, Guo
disclosed. By visiting enterprises on the island, mainland visitor
learned what Taiwan business communities need to further
cross-straits trade relations.
</P>
<P>
The paper also reported that in 1996, CCPIT led Chinese
business delegations to visit Japan, the Republic of Korea,
Britain, Germany, Italy and some East European countries and
members of the Commonwealth of Independent States.
</P>
<P>
As a semi-official trade promotion organ, CCPIT also helped to
multiply market access for Chinese exporters, particularly in
countries they have weak or no presence at all, such as Viet Nam,
Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The council also sent its own delegations to India, Pakistan
Turkey, Israel and Yemen to tackle business potential in South
Asia and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
According to Guo, the council has a tight schedule for overseas

<P>
TIRANA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian government is
taking emergency measures to stop some firms and foundations from
raising funds with promises of high interest in a bid to stabilize
the country's monetary market and protect the depositors.
</P>
<P>
Albania's monetary market was put in disorder recently by some
companies and "charity foundations" that raised funds in the
country with promises of high interest. Some of these fund raisers
defrauded depositors.
</P>
<P>
Angered depositors have staged demonstrations in the capital
and other major cities to protest against this kind of money
collection and asked the government for protection.
</P>
<P>
The government has decided to set up a special committee to
investigate into these companies and foundations and to draw up a
law to stop this kind of fund raising.
</P>
<P>
Those who cheated depositors will be arrested and their bank
accounts be frozen, according to the government's decision.
</P>
<P>
The government also decided to partially make up for the loss
of the depositors.

<P>
BUDAPEST, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Hungary holds that Russia's
interests should be taken into consideration during the
establishment of a new European security system so that Russia
could play its positive role in the area, a Hungarian Foreign
Ministry official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Szentivanyi Gabor, the spokesman from the ministry, said at a
news conference, Hungary expects North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) to establish a special partnership with Russia.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Hungary's joining NATO will not result in the
breakdown of the relations bewteen Hungary and Russia. And Hungary
never doubts that Russia has the right to protect its own security
in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
He argued that NATO's eastward expansion wouldn't constitute a
threat to Russia. Isolating Russia is not only harmful to NATO,
but also to other countries which are ready to join NATO, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Russia should adopt a flexible policy on NATO's
enlargement, otherwise, it could isolate itself in politics and
economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's defense minister said
today that his country will respond to a document on border
differences prepared by Peru within 30 to 60 days.
</P>
<P>
Victor Bayas Garcia, the National Defense Minister, noted that
Ecuador would take mutual trust into consideration when it
scrutinizes the document which aims to consolidate the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
He explained that, at Peru's request, the document would be
signed in Quito in another step towards the solution of border
differences between the two countries
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that two incidents cleared the way for the
United States to continue backing the Ecuador-Peruvian Military
Observers' Mission (MOMEP) through logistical measures.
</P>
<P>
They were the recent meeting of the consultative council of the
MOMEP in Lima, and chief of the Southern Command of the
U.S. Army, Wesley Clark's visit to Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
The long-standing border dispute between Ecuador and Peru over
the Cordillera del Condor, the access to the Amazon river basin,
has embroiled them into wars in 1981, 1991 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
The two South American countries, sharing about 1,600 kilometers
of common border, signed a peace deal in February, 1995, under
international mediation.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Ecuador President Abdala Bucaram visited
Peru. The two countries signed four cooperation agreements on
health, protection of archaeological objects, mutual aid in case
of disasters and scholastic exchanges during his visit.
</P>
<P>
Garcia said that Ecuador's National Security Council decided
to ask the MOMEP to extend its operation for another
three-months.

<HEADLINE> Female workers Offers Good Highway Maintenance in Plateau Tibet (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Years of work in the oxygen-poor field, particularly on winter
days, have left her vulnerable to many of the diseases common to
highway workers: tuberculosis, hypertension and arthritis. And
after years of bending over to fix roads, her posture is stooped.
</P>
<P>
She was eligible for retirement a year ago, but stayed on out
of devotion to her job.
</P>
<P>
The women workers are conscientious, says crew supervisor
Gaisang. "There is not even one case of road blocking or the
report of an accident caused by poor road conditions in our
stretch over the past 20 years."
</P>
<P>
The crew has even collected numerous honors and awards.
</P>
<P>
"We feel very content when we receive support from drivers
along the way as well as from our family members," Sizhub said.
</P>
<P>
Accustomed to prevailing over any kind of weather, the
orange-uniformed crew sets out to work every day at 7:30 a.m.,
armed with food and tools.
</P>
<P>
In winter, their duty is to remove ice and snow from the road,
and in summer, they dig ditches to drain rainwater.
</P>
<P>
But the most strenuous work is melting asphalt and patching
holes in the road. When covered with the residue of hot asphalt,
the crew members are often unrecognizable.
</P>
<P>
"All year around, we rarely have time to take a good rest. But
when we return after a day's work or successfully finish an
important job, there are always happy songs among us," Gaisang
said.

<HEADLINE> Female workers Offers Good Highway Maintenance in Plateau Tibet (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- It may seem like No-Man's Land,
but a crew of women road workers assigned to the remote areas of
the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau are successfully battling harsh natural
conditions to drive tractors, pour asphalt and complete other
highway maintenance chores.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen women are in charge of a stretch about 30 km along the
highway which links Qinghai Province and Tibet, namely from the
city of Golmud to Qinghai and Lhasa, the capital of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The highway is regarded as a lifeline for Tibet, as it carries
up to 80 percent of goods going in, and 90 percent of materials
transported out of the region.
</P>
<P>
The road is more than 1,000 km long, and more than 2,000 road
workers in 36 teams are responsible for its upkeep, with each team
taking charge of a 30 km section.
</P>
<P>
There is only one team of women, who work near Damxung, a
Tibetan town approximately 200 km north of Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
The highway there is located 4,000 to 5,000 meters above sea
level, where the oxygen content is only half that of China's
inland areas.
</P>
<P>
Sizhub, 46, is the oldest worker in the group, which was
organized in 1973. And she shoulders the heaviest workload.
</P>
<P>
"The state has put big money into building and repairing the
Qinghai-Tibet highway, so it is the duty of us maintenance workers
to protect it well," Sizhub said.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, she takes the lead in driving tractors and melting
asphalt. For the past 31 years, she has dedicated herself to
highway maintenance, and takes no time off, even on
holidays.

<HEADLINE> 21 Muslim Rebels Killed in Fighting in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government troops
backed by helicopter gunships killed at least 21 Muslim rebels in
fierce fighting in Mindanao, the southern Philippines, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The reports also said that two soldiers died and four others
were wounded in the clashes that broke out on Tuesday around the
town of Buldon, the main camp of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF) in Maguindanao province.
</P>
<P>
At the Presidential Palace, President Fidel Ramos said on
Wednesday that government efforts to forge peace with the MILF
would continue despite the hostilities.
</P>
<P>
The MILF also announced the same day that the two warring sides
have agreed to a temporary ceasefire and that it would attend the
two sides' second meeting scheduled next month to discuss a
comprehensive ceasefire and their future formal peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Seven Army helicopters, firing rockets and machine guns, backed
800 ground troops in the fighting against about 400 rebels
defending their heavily fortified camp in Buldon, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
The fighting came several days after MILF rebels ambushed a
convoy escorting Buldon mayor last Saturday. The ambush forced the
military to reinforce its troops around Buldon and launch the
latest offensive on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a breakaway faction of the Moro National Liberation
Front (MNLF) which signed a peace agreement with the government
last year, rejected the MNLF-government peace deal and demanded
separate peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary talks between the two panels started last January 7
and both sides have agreed to resume the talks on February 25-26.

methylamphetamines (commonly called "ice"), reported today's
"China Daily".
</P>
<P>
In additional, investigators seized 6.24 kg of psychotropic
drugs and 12 tons of chemical for drug processing, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Customs authorities across the country campaigned more
vigorously against rampant cross-border drug trafficking last year.
</P>
<P>
In one action last March, customs officers from Kunming in
Yunnan Province and Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, joined forces
to seize 107 kg of heroin, the report quoted a customs report as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Located adjacent to drug-producing enclaves in the "Golden
Triangle" area near China's southwest border, Kunming is the
country's front line in fighting against drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Three centers for training drug-sniffing dogs, in Beijing,
Kunming and Kowloon, provided dogs to join the anti-drug campaign.
</P>
<P>
Dogs serving in Ruili, Yunnan Province, helped uncover 16 cases
involving the seizure of 55.15 kg of drugs, such as heroin, opium
and morphine.
</P>
<P>
Customs authorities intensified their inspections at border
posts and halted the trafficking of various drugs totaling 23
kg. Twenty kilograms were seized from the mail by customs
authorities in Kunming, the report said.

ROME, January 22 (Xinhua) -- World soccer power Italy scored a
2-0 victory over Northern Ireland in a soccer friendly at Palermo,
Sicily, on Wednesday.
</P>

The match was part of Italy's preparation for the World Cup

Forward Gian Franco Zolo scored at the 8th minute and
Alessandro Del Piero made it 2-0 with a free-kick later in the

<HEADLINE> Spring Festival to Boost Trade in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Beijing will soon bathe in the
glow of Spring festival which will be colored by the city's
numerous shopping centers and restaurants, reported today's China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
Spring Festival is New Year's day in Chinese lunar calendar.
which falls on February 7 this year. As Christmas does for the
west, Spring Festival also works as a trade booster.
</P>
<P>
"Various goods worth six billion yuan (720 million US dollars)
have been prepared for the booming festival trade, which is
expected to increase by 20 percent over last year," said Liu
Xinfeng, an official with Beijing Municipality Commercial
Commission (BMCC).
</P>
<P>
Some commodities will be sold at discounts. Small gifts will be
given at the Friendship Store, said Wang Bingzhi, vice-general
director of the store on Jianguomen Avenue.
</P>
<P>
"Shopping centers will offer something more than business and
help build up the annual celebration," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
High on Beijingers' seven-day holiday agenda is visiting shops,
where various activities are planned.
</P>
<P>
"I will go shopping during Spring Festival, but not necessarily
to buy. I love to share the happy atmosphere with many others,"
said Liu Huirong, a middle-aged woman working with a state-owned
company.
</P>
<P>
Characteristic couplets will be hung in front of the every
shop. One or two business streets in each district will be heavily
decorated with lanterns, colored buntings and streamers.
</P>
<P>
Celebrities will be invited to some stores for delightful
get-togethers, and chain stores will extend their business hours,
</P>
<P>
said the BMCC official.
</P>
<P>
About 100 restaurants will arrange family banquet services,
challenging the traditional home feast which is symbolic of family
reunions.
</P>
<P>
A survey showed many people chose to eat at restaurants during
the holiday last year.
</P>
<P>
Beijingers who like outdoor activities will find the streets
glittering with happiness.
</P>
<P>
Two kilometers away from Tian'anmen Square, Di'anmen Street
lined with stores and restaurants will turn into a festival fair
offering a large show of Peking Opera, cultural goods and many
flavorful snacks cooked on the spot.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Visits Washington for Unpaid Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Annan, 58, is expected to meet with President Bill Clinton,
Vice President Al Gore and the new U.S. secretary of state,
Madeleine Albright during his three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Minnesota's congressional delegation after his
arrival, Annan said that he was "fairly certain" the U.S. Congress
would settle 1.3 billion U.S. dollars in unpaid dues.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been in deep financial trouble because the
Congress, accusing the world body lacks enough reform, refuses to
pay the debt.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has proposed paying the money by 1999, but whether the
Republican-dominated Congress agree or not remains another
question.
</P>
<P>
"War is a failure of diplomacy," Annan told the U.S.
congressmen, "If that is indeed correct, then surely diplomacy is
a first line of defense."
</P>
<P>
The world leaders will spend a little less of the money they
are putting into defense and armaments, but more into diplomacy, he
stressed.

<HEADLINE> Brazil to Be Largest Cotton Importer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Brazil will become the
largest importer of cotton in the world this year by acquiring
561,000 tons of the fiber.
</P>
<P>
The import will cost the country 900 million U.S. dollars, 40.2
percent over 1995, according to Jose Sergio Baima Magalhaes, a
technician for the Department of Economic Analysis of the National
Basic Commodities Company.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian cotton is losing its market to imported cotton due to
the financial advantages offered by foreign producers.
</P>
<P>
Brazilians consume 850,000 tons of cotton a year, exceeding its
domestic production of 340,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Brazil was one of the world's biggest exporters of cotton up
until the nineties when its exports reached 124,000 tons in 1991.

<P>
SHENZHEN, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Early phase construction of
the Ling'ao Nuclear Power Plant, one kilometer away from the
nuclear power plant at Daya Bay, south China's Guangdong Province,
is proceeding swiftly.
</P>
<P>
So far, workers have finished building roads linking the
construction sites, and have completed six million cu m of
earthworks.
</P>
<P>
They have also started to pour cement for the foundation of the
No. 1 nuclear island and have begun construction on the embankment
to hold back sea waves.
</P>
<P>
A reservoir specially-built for the nuclear power plant has
stored up more than 500,000 cu m of water, according to officials
in charge of the construction.
</P>
<P>
The Ling'ao Nuclear Power Plant is the second of its kind in
Guangdong and will have two generating units, each with a capacity
of 900,000 kw.
</P>
<P>
Construction began last July and is scheduled to be completed
in the year of 2000. It will be completely financed with foreign
capital.
</P>
<P>
The Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant has been operating safely
since it was completed and put into operation three years ago, and
has generated and transmitted into the local power grid an
aggregate 32 billion kw/hour of electricity.
</P>
<P>
The two generating units there produced 11.53 billion kw/hour
of electricity last year.

<P>
LHASA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Foreign funding will be used to
develop the world's highest nature reserve, located on the Chinese
side of the boundary between China and Nepal.
</P>

</P>
<P>
The Mount Qomolangma Nature Reserve includes five mountain
peaks that are at least 8,000 meters above the sea level, and
covers an area of 330,000 square kilometers. Situated on the
northern flank of the Himalayas, it attracts some 30,000 tourists
every year. In 1994, it was designated as a state-level nature
reserve.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the UN funding, a U.S. organization has also
sent donations to the area to help the local residents develop the
economy.
</P>
<P>
"The number of plants and animals in the area is increasing,"
said Yan, adding that the residents' awareness of environmental
protection has been upgraded.

<HEADLINE> Guidelines for Investors in Russian Energy Published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Economic
Commission for Europe (UNECE) has published new guidelines for
investors to help enhance energy efficiency in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Russian experts estimate that up to 40 percent of their current
national energy use is wasted, according to a UNECE press release
Tuesday. "To fight against this waste, important new legislation
has been passed in the Russian Federation to enhance energy
efficiency," it said.
</P>
<P>
In its guidelines, the UNECE described the new policy measures
and the financing methods created in the Russian legislation in
order to provide assistance in preparing loan projects in the
country.
</P>
<P>
With the guidelines, the UNECE said, foreign investors will
have important new information on recently developed financing
mechanisms, investment guarantees, Council of Ministers decisions,
laws and regulations governing energy efficiency investments in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
"The guidelines should reduce costs for investors by providing
information needed for the due diligence of investment projects
together with two worked examples of how new financing mechanisms
would be applied in the Russian market," said the UNECE.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, two World Bank loan projects for energy
efficiency investments had been approved and signed by Russian
authorities to provide an important source of long-term capital
for investments in this sector, according to the release.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank's Russian Energy Efficiency Project provides 120
million U.S. dollars for 10 cities, six of which are energy
efficiency demonstration zones of the UNECE Energy Efficiency 2000
Project.
</P>
<P>
The second loan is the Enterprise Housing Divestiture Project
designed to improve the energy efficiency in housing and municipal
buildings for 300 million U.S. dollars in six cities, one of which
is an energy efficiency demonstration zone.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of 1997, the UNECE Energy Efficiency 2000
Project will be holding training courses on financial engineering.
The courses are scheduled to begin in February in St. Petersburg
composed of teams from six to eight energy efficiency
demonstration zones to develop business plans for investment
projects.
</P>
<P>
As a result, World Bank Project Implementation Units will have
the opportunity to guide energy efficiency demonstration zones
management teams in the preparation of their business plans so
that successful plans could be considered for financing from the
World Bank loan projects, the UNECE said.

</P>
<P>
Werner will work along with Ghanian coach Sam Arday, the report

He is the fourth German in recent years after Rudi Guttendorf,
Burkhard Ziese and Otto Pfister, to be assigned to the Ghana
national football team.
</P>
<P>
His first test in his new job will be this weekend's Africa Cup
of Nations qualifier against Zimbabwe in Harare, the report said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Swiss Gov't Urges Parliament to Ratify Protocol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss federal council
(government) today urged parliament to ratify a new protocol to
the Convention on the Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution
signed in Geneva in 1979.
</P>
<P>
In a message to parliament, the government said that the
entering into force of the new protocol is important for
Switzerland, which has suffered a lot by acid deposits from
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The protocol, open for signature in 1994, has been signed by 28
state parties to the 1979 convention. It has been ratified by four
countries up to mid-1996. Sixteen countries are needed for the
entering into force of the protocol.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the protocol takes into account the diverse
extents of acid deposits in different regions of Europe. Thus, the
engagements that different countries have to meet are different.
For Switzerland, it should reduce its emission of sulfur 52
percent from its level in 1980 by the year 2000, when its emission
of sulfur should not exceed 60,000 tons a year. For its neighbors
like France, Germany and Italy, the reduction should be 74
percent, 83 percent and 65 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland is said to have taken measures to fulfill its
obligations. The government predicted that it will cut 74 percent
of the sulfur emission from the level in 1980 by the year 2000 to
30,000 tons a year.

NEW YORK, January 22 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks edged to more
new highs today, but the Dow Jones industrial average was dragged
down by IBM, which didn't report as robust profits as other
computer giants.
</P>
<P>
The Dow lost 33.87 points to 6,850.03 at the closing.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with NYSE volume totaling 585.72
million shares as against 571.27 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
Broader measures turned mostly positive after some morning
stumbles. Several indexes set new highs, including the fifth
straight by the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 list of larger companies,
which was up 3.50 to 786.22.
</P>
<P>
Other recorder setters were: the NYSE composite index, up 1.23
to 412.80; the Nasdaq composite index, up 11.07 to 1,388.04; and
the Russell 2000 list of smaller companies, up 0.33 to 370.65.
</P>
<P>
The American Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.93 to
590.87.
</P>

The day's gains came despite pressure from the bond market,
which gave up some early gains.

As bonds fell today, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond
rose from late Tuesday's 6.78 percent to 6.82 percent.

<HEADLINE> US Dollar Breaks Past 119 Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar surpassed 119
yen for the first time in nearly four years today.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors gave a positive assessment of Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan's upbeat appraisal of the U.S. economy
Tuesday. Coupled with fresh evidence of economic weakness in Japan
and Germany, the dollar gained strength.
</P>
<P>
It was also one of the biggest one-day gains in the dollar
since the currency began appreciating sharply against the mark and
yen late last year. The latest rally has pushed the dollar up
nearly 3 percent against the yen and nearly 7 percent against the
mark in the first three weeks of 1997 alone.
</P>
<P>
The dollar also traded as high as 1.6454 marks, the strongest
since June 1994, before settling in New York at 1.6427, up from
1.6286 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The mark's weakness partly reflected a weak German economy as
reflected in data from the Bundesbank, which was expected to lower
interest rates Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Electoral Commission Verifies 9 More Seats in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Belgrade Electoral
Commission today preliminarily verified nine more seats for the
city council and only one seat was left undecided, commission
Chairman Radomir Lazarevic said.
</P>
<P>
Out of the nine candidates approved today, four were from the
ruling Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) and the Yugoslav Left (JUL)
and four from the opposition Zajedno coalition, and one was from
the Serbian Radical Party (SRS).
</P>
<P>
Lazarevic told a news conference that 109 mandates for the
110-seat city assembly had been verified so far, and the remaining
seat was still disputed and put on pending.
</P>
<P>
So far, 64 Zajedno deputies, 27 SPS-JUL deputies, 16 SRS
deputies and two deputies of the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS)
have been elected preliminarily.
</P>
<P>
Zajedno has been leading daily street protests in Belgrade over
the past nine weeks against the annulment of the local election
results and demanded full recognition of its victory in 14 major
cities across Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Lazrevic said the commission was "demanding the exemption of
the president of Belgrade's first municipal court, his deputies
and all judges."
</P>
<P>
"They have made themselves unfit to rule on the appeals of the
SPS and the SRS by publishing their positions before passing a
decision, thereby prejudicing the court's future ruling," he
explained.
</P>
<P>
The commission also asked for the exemption of the president of
the Belgrade district court and the acting president of the
Serbian Supreme Court and his deputies, Lazarevic said, without
giving further explanation.

<HEADLINE> US Fed Report Says Economy Grows in Moderate Pace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The recent economic growth
in the U.S. was moderate in most of the country with little
increase in price pressures, the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed)
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Fed made the conclusion in the latest survey on the
economic activities in its 12 regional reserve districts, which
was conducted before January 13.
</P>
<P>
"Economic growth in December and early January was moderate in
most parts of the country," the Fed report said.
</P>
<P>
It said that holiday season sales were in line with expectation
of moderate growth and manufacturing activity continued to grow
with significant strength coming from capital equipment and
materials manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Wage increases in the districts were moderate overall despite
widespread reports of continued wage pressure for skilled
manufacturing worker groups. And labor markets were uniformly
tight in some districts, the U.S. Fed said.
</P>
<P>
The report said, "Price pressure were moderate overall, with
exception of sharply rising of energy costs."
</P>
<P>
But price increases were more widely reported than earlier in a
few districts.
</P>
<P>
The survey report, known as Beige Book, will be important data
for the U.S. Fed's policy-maker, the Federal Open Market Committee
(FOMC), in deciding the monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
The FOMC will meet early next month for the first time this
year. Many analysts have forecast that the interest rate will
remain unchanged at the next FOMC meeting.

<HEADLINE> US Senate Confirms Cohen as Secretary of Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate today
confirmed former Sen. William Cohen as the 20th secretary of
defense, the only Republican in President Bill Clinton's
second-term Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The Senate made the confirmation with a vote of 99-0, without
the vote by Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said he expects to be sworn in today at a private
ceremony at the Pentagon, the Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
In his confirmation hearing at the Senate Armed Services
Committee earlier today, Cohen said he will carry on many of
Clinton's policies. He stressed that the United States must
modernize its weapons, cut the armed forces and put focus on its
security relations with Asia and Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Cohen also emphasized that preserving a high-quality force,
ensuring readiness for battle and modernizing weapons systems will
be his top priorities.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said that he will continue to implement the U.S. policies
designed to build partnership with Russia, set NATO on the course
toward enlargement, strengthen U.S. alliance with Japan and
develop military-to-military ties with China.
</P>
<P>
He said he will consider to shift emphasis in some Clinton
administration priorities. "I intend to give new focus to our
security relations in the Asia Pacific region" to maintain the
American interests in the fast-developing region, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen indicated he will consider further reductions in overall
force size to meet higher priorities of weapons modernization.
</P>
<P>
Local military experts said the troops cuts could mean the army
will have to drop below its current level of 10 active-duty
divisions. Other options will include reducing Navy ship strength
below 346 vessels, including 11 active carriers and one in
reserve, or cutting the 20 active and reserve fighter wings.
</P>
<P>
Cohen also defended the administration's intent to develop a
national missile defense plan by 2000 and delay until then a
decision on whether to build and deploy the system.
</P>
<P>
On the U.S. military presence in Bosnia, Cohen promised that
U.S. troops will end its Bosnia mission after 18 months and said
European allies will have to take over the peacekeeping in the
country if necessary.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Hopes for More Int'l Aid for Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 22 (Xinhua) -- A senior Serbian official for
refugee affairs said today that 1997 would be the most difficult
year so far for refugees in Yugoslavia because the country would
receive much less international aid for refugees than before.
</P>
<P>
Bratislava Morina, the Serbian commissioner for refugees, told
the new UNHCR envoy for the former Yugoslavia Carrol Faubert that
as the crisis in the region had ended, Yugoslavia was no long the
priority of the international aid agencies, which would make
things for refugees from bad to worse.
</P>
<P>
The difficult situation would be further aggravated for the
refugees because of Serbia's limited budget and the fact that the
population had economically been exhausted, Morina said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia has sheltered more than 600,000 refugees from the
former Yugoslav region since the Yugoslav crisis broke out in
1991, which is a heavy burden for the country both economically
and socially.
</P>
<P>
Morina pointed out that Yugoslavia gave precedence to the
return of refugees and would lend full support to the
international community in its efforts to have as many refugees as
possible return to Bosnia and also Croatia.
</P>
<P>
Due to the slow progress in economic reconstruction in Bosnia
and the unwillingness of the authorities, the repatriation of
refugees back to their homes has been hindered and only 200,000
out of more than 2 million refugees have returned.
</P>
<P>
The Tanjug news agency quoted Morina as saying that the fourth
regional meeting of the commissioners for refugees of Bosnia,
Croatia and Yugoslavia would be held in Belgrade on February 17 to
review the national plans of seeking lasting solutions to the
issue.
</P>
<P>
Faubert, who arrived here Tuesday on a several-day visit,
appreciated Yugoslavia's humanitarian efforts in caring for a very
large number of refugees over the past years and confirmed that
the UNHCR would continue supporting Yugoslavia in that as much as
possible.
</P>
<P>
He said he was especially pleased that Yugoslavia would back
the so-called Sadako camps, initiated by U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees Sadako Ogata, where young people would be included in
aiding refugees.
</P>
<P>
He also said a total of 200,000 refugees were expected to
return to Bosnia in 1997 under a UNHCR plan for the repatriation
of refugees.

<HEADLINE> Bogus Investment Schemes Exposed in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Athens, February 22 (Xinhua) -- A Greek local public
prosecutor's office claimed today that the so-called
get-rich-quick "pyramid" schemes being run by private companies in
the country's northern port city of Salonika constituted fraud in
the criminal sense.
</P>
<P>
Proceedings have already been instituted against Salonika
resident Ioannis Gourmetsou, 35, alleged organizer of two versions
of the pyramid scheme with the names "golden" and silver".
</P>
<P>
Thousands of residents of northern Greece are believed to be
participating in the bogus investment schemes with an estimated
turnover of tens of million of drachmas.
</P>
<P>
According to Salonika public prosecutor's office, the criminal
offense of fraud is constituted by the fact that after some time,
players reaching the top of a "pyramid" are unable to secure a
return on their "investment".
</P>
<P>
The coupons and computers used by another eight pyramid schemes
have been confiscated and legal procceedings are being prepared.
</P>
<P>
Presenting details today of just one scheme, Salonika police
chief Costas Economou said 10,215 people had registered between
November 2-11, 1996, with a total turnover of 66 million drachmas
(about 275,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Similar schemes have reportedly ruined thousands of people in
neighboring Albania who have staged demonstrations in Tirana and
other major cities in an effort to retrieve their savings.

<HEADLINE> Israel Army: Cellular Phones Cause Trouble in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 22 (Xinhua) -- As more and more Israeli
armymen have cellular phones, the army has banned such phones in
the battle field in south Lebanon because they have been found to
cause troubles.
</P>
<P>
Israel Army Radio today reported that following clashes in
southern Lebanon, many Israeli soldiers stationed in the Security
Zone usually call their homes to say they are okay and to report
details of fighting with Hezbollah gunmen.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 1,100-square-kilometer security zone in
1985 in a bid to protect northern Israel from cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
The problem emerged after a radio scanner was found on the body
of a dead Hezbollah gunman -- that the enemy can easily obtain
information of the Israeli side, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
No phones are allowed in security zone, the army announced,
ignoring complaints by soldiers and many family members.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Israeli media reported that one million Israelis
already own cellular phones, representing a figure of one out of
every five citizen in this country, which currently has a
population of 5.5 million.
</P>
<P>
As this number of cellular phone owners is expected to double
this year, the battle between Pelephone and Cellcom, Israel's two
cellular phone providers, intensifies, in order to capture the
ever-growing cellular phone market.
</P>
<P>
During 1996, Cellcom was reportedly selling 1,000 phones a
day, and now, with the start of the company's latest sale, the
number has jumped to 2,000 a day.

confirmed there was no change in the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said the Russian diplomat has contacted
the central offices of the production companies and confirmed the
report was "groundless."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus signed an agreement with the Russians on January 4 to
buy S-300 surface-to-air missiles with a range of 150
kilometers. The deal has triggered criticism from the United
States and threats of war from Turkey.
</P>
<P>
However, the Cypriot government insisted that the deal is
purely for the sake of its defense.
</P>
<P>
This eastern Mediterranean island remains divided since
1974 when Turkish troops occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a short-lived coup seeking union with
Greece.

<HEADLINE> New Nissan Model to Create 3,500 Jobs in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Nissan, the Japanese car maker,
announced Tuesday that it would invest 215 million pounds (366
million US dollars) to build a third model in its Sunderland plant
in north east England, creating 3,500 jobs.
</P>
<P>
The news, which came just days after U.S. rival Ford announced
that it would cut 1,300 jobs at its Halewood plant in Liverpool,
north west England, cheered the motor industry.
</P>
<P>
It was especially welcomed by the government, as British Trade
and Industry Secretary Ian Lang said: "This latest decision by
Nissan marks a significant development in their presence in Europe
and underlines the attractions of the UK as a place to
manufacture."
</P>
<P>
Nissan, Japan's second-biggest car maker, said the launch of
the new model, a mid-sized family car, would create 800 jobs at
Sunderland, with a further 2,700 jobs at more than 100 British
component suppliers.
</P>
<P>
The new model has been planned for the past three years and
will enter production in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The move will bring Nissan's total investment in Britain to 1.5
billion pounds (2.6 billion US dollars), and the company, which
has 4.6 percent of the British car market, built 230,000 cars at
Sunderland last year and expects to produce about 250,000 this
year.
</P>
<P>
Introducing the new model could take annual output to about
350,000 units by 2000, and would take the proportion of its
European sales built in the region to 90 percent by 2000 from 70
percent at present, Nissan said.

<HEADLINE> Oldest Stone Tools Found in Northern Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- A research body of
Ethiopia said here today that scientists of Ethiopia and the
United States have discovered the oldest stone tools at Gona in
Afar Regional State of Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The Center for Research and Conservation of Cultural Heritage
of Ethiopia said fossils of the makers of the tools have not yet
been found, but the scientists said they were probably made by
ancestral humans (homo) that lived between 2.5-2.6 million years
ago along ancient streams.
</P>
<P>
The center quoted a paper on the discovery as saying
that the presence of small patches of even earlier stone tools at
Gona had been known since the early 1970s, but their age had not
been confirmed until March 1995.
</P>
<P>
An Ethiopian paleontologist and principal author of the
paper said that "these are the oldest stone tools ever
found."
</P>
<P>
The stone tools were found in the remote Afar depression of
Ethiopia, about 300 km northeast of Addis Ababa and 75 km north
of Aramis, where the oldest fossil hominids were recently found.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, the Gona research team
consists of more than 10 scientists including geologists,
archeologists and paleontologists.
</P>
<P>
Members of the team are planning to continue field work to
search for fossil hominids, fossil animals and plant remains in
order to identify the makers of the earlier tools.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF to Assist Tanzania in Primary Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) will inject 7.5 million U.S. Dollars in
Tanzanian primary education in the next five years (1997-2001).
</P>
<P>
Announcing the financial assistance at a press conference held
here today, UNICEF Chief Education Cluster Fay Chung said that
the funds will be spent on improving primary schools in the
country.
</P>
<P>
She said other areas earmarked for improvement include
increasing pupils enrollment rate from 53 to 80 percent by the
year 2001 and increase primary school completion rate from 70 in
1994 to 85 percent by the year 2001 for both girls and boys.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF official told reporters that funds will be used in
contacting in-service training for primary school teachers,
equipping schools with text books and other relevant facilities.
</P>
<P>
"The UNICEF will advocate 90 percent of the funds go direct to
the schools for solving the immmediate problems," emphasized the
chief education cluster.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF official further said there is no reason why
children in the country should achieve poorer education than
those in the United States, adding that today primary education
is regarded as a basic human right and every child has the right
to achieve it.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, she said developing countries must be
prepared to spend more of its budget on education#,
science and technology development if they need not to become
slaves of the western economy.
</P>
<P>
She noted that Tanzania is still spending very little on
education and appealed to the government to take deliberate
measures for increasing the budget on the education sector.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Calls for Activation of Economic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri called here today for activation of economic relations
with Syria, noting that it was the "first door" for promoting
the idea of a common Arab market.
</P>
<P>
Describing Syria as a "vital" factor for Lebanon's economy,
the prime minister told a weekly session of Lebanon's Council of
Ministers that the economic ties between the two countries
should match the Lebanese-Syrian political and security
relations.
</P>
<P>
Hariri presided over the cabinet meeting in his office,
Information Minister Bassem Sabaa told reporters after
the weekly cabinet session.
</P>
<P>
Sabaa said that at the beginning of the meeting, the prime
minister briefed his ministers on the outcome of the recent
economic meetings in Damascus of the two countries' premiers and
ministers.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Follow-up and Coordination Committee headed by
Hariri and his Syrian counterpart Mahmoud Al-Zouebi held two
meetings in the Syrian capital on January 11 and on January 20. As
a result, a series of agreements on economic cooperation were
signed by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The meetings were held within the framework of the "Treaty of
Brotherhood, Cooperation and Coordination" Syria and Lebanon
signed in May, 1991.
</P>
<P>
Hariri was quoted by the information minister as saying
that the Damascus meetings completed the preparation for a
session of the Syrian-Lebanese Higher Council, a body involving
top Syrian and Lebanese leaders.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that the date of the meeting is
to be determined by Lebanese President Elias Hrawi and Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
"The political and security relations have reached expected
goals in all aspects and can be really described as distinctive
or in the best situation," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hariri noted that the economic relations in the fields of
agriculture, industry and exchange of trade have made tangible
headway in the integration, "but there is still a very long way
before us in order to push these relations forward."
</P>
<P>
"We should work together in order to remove the obstacles
which have accumulated in the past 50 years and have disputed
the integration between the two brotherly countries," the
billionaire prime minister said.

<HEADLINE> German IRA Extradition Upheld by UK High Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- IRA terrorist suspect Roisin
McAliskey lost her High Court bid today to have a request by
Germany for her extradition declared as unlawful.
</P>
<P>
Two British judges in the Court ruled that Germany could seek
her extradition. They rejected arguments that it was unlawful
under the European Convention because Germany does not allow its
own citizens to be extradited.
</P>
<P>
McAliskey is wanted in connection with an alleged IRA mortar
attack on British army barracks in Osnabruck in June last year.
</P>
<P>
It was the first IRA attack in continental Europe since a
17-month ceasefire was broken by the IRA last February.
</P>
<P>
Gareth Peirce, who is representing McAliskey, criticised the
decision by saying "anyone's primary concern is that here is a
young woman in poor health who is on a collision course between
pregnancy and extradition."
</P>
<P>
McAliskey's mother accused Britain of racism and inhumanity in
its treatment of her daughter.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) Bingu Mutharika
said here today that the COMESA Council of Ministers has no right
to appoint a team to investigate his alleged misuse of funds or
dismiss him.
</P>
<P>
He said he was appointed by the heads of government of the
COMESA member countries, not by the Council of Ministers, so he
does not recognize the five-man team to probe the case.
</P>
<P>
Bingu has been sent on leave pending the investigations into
his alleged misuse of funds.
</P>
<P>
The team has been given 30 days to compile a report on the
case.
</P>
<P>
The decision to send Bingu on the three-month leave came after
complaints by some member countries of the chief executive's
conduct.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the council, Malawian Commerce and Industry
Minister Chakakala Chaziya said here last Saturday that the team
comprising Zambia, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Uganda and Zaire will conduct
an audit of the organization's finances and investigations of the
entire COMESA management.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean Herald reported last Thursday that Bingu was
accused of using COMESA fund for personal trips to his home
country Malawi, where he is laying a presidential foundation. He
is said to be eyeing the Malawian presidency.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that he was shuttling between Zambia and
Zimbabwe, where his wife comes from, and where he owns a farm.

<HEADLINE> EU Economy to Show Mixed Results in 1997: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Europan Union(EU) economy
in 1997 is expected to see a slow growth in business confidence, a
small rise in investment and stagnant jobs growth, according to
today's local reports citing the results of a survey conducted by
Eurochambers, an association of EU chambers of commerce.
</P>
<P>
In the survey, covering 97 economic regions and 12 of the EU's
15 member countries, the organization found that most entrepreneur
are cautious and "uncertain about the force of the current
recovery, or its length".
</P>
<P>
The business climate was most positive in Denmark, Sweden,
Finland, Britain, Ireland and the Netherlands, with strong export
growth followed recently by a pickup in domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that efforts to meet the preconditions
of a single European currency could effect business in both
positive and negative ways, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
"Budgetary cuts may suppress domestic demand. On the other
hand, the resulting better-balanced national budgets may instill
faith in the financial markets, thereby lowering interest rates,
which is conducive to investments," the survey was reported as
saying.
</P>
<P>
There was little change expected in labour markets, with
notable differences throughout the EU.
</P>
<P>
France, Britain and Spain showed a slight improvement in firms'
expectation for creating jobs, while Germany's outlook remained
rather weak.

<HEADLINE> EU Commission Says EU Enlargement Unlikely Before 2002 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 22 (Xinhua) -- In contradistinction to
Franco-German eagerness to see the European Union(EU) absorbs
central and eastern European countries, the European
Commission(EC) said today that no new country was likely to join
before 2002.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac and Foreign Minister Herve de
Charette said recently that a target date of 2000 for enlargement
was achievable if there was "political will".
</P>
<P>
The European Commission -- charged with preparing the
groundwork for talks with 10 applicant central and eastern
European countries -- however, predicted lengthy and complicated
talks.
</P>
<P>
"Taking into account the possible duration of negotiations and
time needed for ratification, the earliest realistic date for the
first accessions is likely to be no earlier than 2002," it said in
a 30-point fact sheet on the EU's enlargement process.
</P>
<P>
Poland, Czech Republic and Hungary are generally regarded as
the most economically advanced applicants, with countries like
Bulgaria and Romania trying hard to catch up.
</P>
<P>
The three Baltic States -- Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania --
have also applied, along with Slovenia and Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
The Commission is currently working on individual advice,
taking into account the political and economic situation in each
country.
</P>
<P>
It promised to unveil the advice "immediately after the
conclusion of the EU Inter-Governmental Conference" on a new EU
treaty.
</P>
<P>
The treaty is scheduled to be concluded in June at the EU's
Amsterdam Summit.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Suggests Modernized Weapons, Closer Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- United States Defense
Secretary-designate William Cohen told a senate committee today
that the U.S. should modernize its weapons system to help maintain
the nation's global leadership and give focus to security
relations in the Asia Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Cohen
also said preserving a high-quality force, ensuring readiness for
battle and modernizing weapons systems will be his top priorities
along with expanding NATO and continuing constructive relations
with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said that he will continue to implement the U.S. policies
designed to build partnership with Russia, set NATO on the course
toward enlargement, strengthen U.S. alliance with Japan and
develop military-to-military ties with China.
</P>
<P>
He said he will consider to shift emphasis in some Clinton
administration priorities. "I intend to give new focus to our
security relations in the Asia Pacific region" to maintain the
American interests in the fast-developing region, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen indicated he will consider further reductions in overall
force size to meet higher priorities of weapons modernization.
</P>
<P>
The troop cuts could mean the army would have to drop below its
current level of 10 active-duty divisions. Other options would
include reducing Navy ship strength below 346 vessels, including
11 active carriers and one in reserve, or cutting the 20 active
and reserve fighter wings.
</P>
<P>
"I anticipate coming back to this committee to seek support for
the tough but necessary decisions I will make," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen also defended the administration's intent to develop a
national missile defense plan by 2000 and delay until then a
decision on whether to build and deploy the system.
</P>
<P>
Senate would likely vote on the Cohen nomination late today or
Thursday.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Islamic
parliamentary members proposed today to amend the constitution
of the country in order to make the Islamic Sharia Law as the
only source of legislation.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-seven members of the 50-seat National Assembly proposed
to amend article two of the Kuwaiti constitution, which stipulates
that "Islam is the state's religion and the Islamic Sharia is a
major source for legislation." They wanted to change the wording
into "the religion of the state is Islam and the Islamic Sharia
is the only source of legislation."
</P>
<P>
Proposals of such amendment had been put forward more than
once in the small Islamic Gulf state during the last term of the
Parliament, but failed to get approval from Amir Sheikh Jaber
Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah as well as the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The 174th article of the Kuwaiti constitution stipulates that
"the Amir and one-third of the National Assembly members have
the right of mandating the constitution by amending, canceling a
clause or more, or adding new clauses." Kuwaiti cabinet
ministers are also considered as parliamentary members.
</P>
<P>
The issue of amendment caused sharp debate between the
Islamists and liberals whenever it was raised in the parliament
in the past.
</P>
<P>
Islamist activists in Kuwait have been pursuing a campaign to
implement the Sharia, trying to replace rules that directly
violate the Sharia with Islamic ones.
</P>
<P>
They said that article two has been one of the most
controversial articles since 1962 when the constitution was
approved.
</P>
<P>
However, the liberals in the country fear that implementation
of the Islamic Sharia might affect the country's image of
democracy and take away many of the freedoms the people now
enjoy.

<HEADLINE> France, Canada Set to Reinforce Trans-Atlantic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 22 (Xinhua) -- France and Canada today signed a
declaration of reinforced partnership which calls for
strengthening of political coordinations and an increase of trade
and scientific-technological cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The declaration, signed by visiting Canadian Prime Minister
Jean Chretien and his French counterpart, Alain Juppe, expected
the leaders of the two countries to hold regular meetings to
consolidate institutional concertations, and to make bilateral
trade in the year 2000 three times the present volume.
</P>
<P>
Juppe said that the declaration is a "concrete expression of
our will to reinforce our relations."
</P>
<P>
The declaration insisted particularly on increasing bilateral
cooperation in information and communication technologies,
including the building of a trans-Atlantic information
super-highway in France.
</P>
<P>
The two countries will also seek cooperation in the reform of
NATO, in improving efficiency of United Nations institutions, in
negotiations at the World Trade Organization, in providing aid for
development, in cooperation among French-speaking countries, in
helping solve regional crises, in fighting drug trafficking and
trans-national crimes, in disarmament and in nuclear
non-proliferation.
</P>
<P>
France and Canada will sign Thursday several cooperation
contracts in television broadcasting, telecommunications, computer
science and airspace industry, said Canadian Industry Minister
John Manley, who is accompanying Chretien on a two-day visit here.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between France and Canada now only takes up 1
percent of the total overseas trade of the two nations.
</P>
<P>
Canada, which has signed a free trade treaty with the United
States and Mexico, is seeking to increase its economic ties with
Europe, said Chretien in an interview with the local daily,
Liberation.
</P>
<P>
He said that Canada, which is both a Pacific nation and an
Atlantic nation, knows what the world will be like tomorrow, as
the Canadian society is becoming more and more culturally
globalized.

<HEADLINE> Garbage Collection in Nairobi to Be Privatized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi today told the Nairobi City Council to privatize garbage
collection with immediate effect.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that despite levying service charges on the
city residents, the council has "totally failed to carry out its
obligations."
</P>
<P>
It is a pity that due to the council's incompetent management,
the city's image and services have been downgraded to "a pathetic
state", Moi stressed.
</P>
<P>
President Moi was speaking outside Kenyatta International
Conference Center while walking around to meet the people and
joined them for lunch at a city restaurant, the Kenya News
Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Nairobi is the gate to Kenya in terms of
international airlines and therefore reflects the proper image of
the country.
</P>
<P>
In response to Moi's speech, Kenyan Minister for Local
Government Francis Lotodo today pledged to move speedily to
implement Moi's order to privatize garbage collection in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here today, Lotodo called on all Nairobi
residents to ensure that every homestead is painted, has a
garbage bin and maintains neat and hygienic surroundings.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: U.S. Will End Troops Deployment in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
nominee William Cohen said today that the U.S. troop commitment to
Bosnia will end after 18 months even if European nations decide
further peacekeeping is needed.
</P>
<P>
During his televised confirmation hearing before the Senate
Armed Services Committee, Cohen said, "It (Bosnia) was principally
a European problem to be solved...it is time for them to assume
responsibility."
</P>
<P>
He said, "This is a signal and a very strong message for our
European friends."
</P>
<P>
He added, "One of the first things I would hope to do if
confirmed is to make a trip to visit with our European friends and
to indicate the strong feelings that we have about it."
</P>
<P>
With the Bosnia peace Implementation Force, or IFOR already
winding down, the United States is committing 8,500 troops to a
follow-on force to serve in Bosnia for 18 months.
</P>
<P>
"The definition of an exit strategy is elusive," Cohen
conceded. But he said, "Here setting a timeline is important
because it's telling our European friends that we are not going to
make an unlimited commitment to that region. We are not there on a
permanent or semipermanent basis."
</P>
<P>
Cohen said he would review the troop deployment every six
months and expected the 8,500-member force to "come down
significantly" in the next six months to a year.

<HEADLINE> Date for New Angolan Govt. Still to Be Set, Mbeki </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The date for the
installation of an Agnolan government of national unity,
initially schedued for January 25, was still to be determined,
South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This was the word from the Angolan government when he visited
Luanda earlier this week, Mbeki told reporters in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
"We have proceeded on the basis of the 25th, but we will be quite
happy to wait until they give an indication as to when," Mbeki was
quoted as saying by South African Press Association (SAPA).
</P>
<P>
He said the purpose of his trip to Luanda was to inform the
Angolan government on the recent talks between the South African
governmet and Angolan opposition leader Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
Luanda was assured that South Africa had no intention of
intervening in the peace process in Angola or to act as mediator.
</P>
<P>
The talks with Savimbi were aimed at sharing the South African
government's experience with the former Angolan rebel leader with
regard to the establishment of a government of unity, Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the possibility of South African aid to Angola, Mbeki
said a South African delegation recently visited Luanda to explore
Angola's needs.
</P>
<P>
Problems relating to the supply of water and electricity were among
other things examined, said Mbeki. He added that South Africa was keen
to help Angola's reconstruction. enditem

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Experts Arrive in Dublin on Cattle Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- A team of Egyptian veterinary
experts have arrived in Dublin for urgent talks with their Irish
counterparts to discuss Egypt's ban on Irish beef exports over BSE
or mad cow disease fears.
</P>
<P>
The three-member delegation started their four-day round of
inspections and meetings with Irish beef industry representatives,
who are pressing for an early lifting of the ban, according to
reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
This visit follows intense negotiations between Irish Foreign
Minister Dick Spring and his Egyptian counterpart, Amr Moussa, on
how to resolve the cattle trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian government imposed a six-month ban on Irish live
cattle after the Irish government announced earlier this month
that the number of new cases of mad cow disease last year had
reached a record high of 73.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Irish Agriculture Department said that it
was "confident" of impressing on the Egyptian delegation the
"elaborate control system we have in place as far as BSE is
concerned."
</P>
<P>
He also claimed that Ireland now had the strictest controls on
BSE in the world, far exceeding those demanded by the European
Union.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Business Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are business
briefs from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- Kuwait is drafting legislation for establishing
Islamic banks aimed at encouraging people to deposit their money
in compliance with the Islamic sharia law.
</P>
<P>
Salem Abdelaziz Al-Sabah, governor of the Central Bank of
Kuwait, said Tuesday that the Kuwaiti market needs these kinds of
banks which apply the Islamic sharia in money dealing, adding that
a certain class of investors might move their funds abroad if such
banks do not exist.
</P>
<P>
He said serious steps are already underway to prepare a bill on
establishing Islamic banks.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has only one Islamic bank, the Kuwait Finance House,
where Muslims can make deposits against seven conventional banks,
although there are several finance institutes that operate
investment funds according to the Islamic code.
</P>
<P>
Islamic banks have become popular among the world's one
billion Muslims, especially in Arab states including the Gulf and
Asian states such as Malaysia and Indonesia, with more than 185
financial institutions. The Islamic financial institutions'
assets had jumped 21 times in ten years to around 166 billion
U.S. dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sabah said "a team of technical and legal cadres was
formed at the Central Bank to outline an integrated plan to
prepare the said bill and put it into effect."
</P>
<P>
Adnan Al-Bahar, board Chairman of the International Investor
Company which is run according to the Islamic system, said in an
earlier statement that 1997 would be the year for establishing
Islamic banks.
</P>
<P>
Other Islamic banking institutions operating on the Kuwaiti
market include the International Group, Investment Dar (house)
and International for Murabaha (an Islamic law on resale with
specification of gain). But the Kuwait Finance House remained in
control of the market in this regard.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran is to pay 4 billion U.S. dollars of foreign
debts that get mature in 1997, local press reported today, citing
banking authorities.
</P>
<P>
The foreign debt payment will constitute nearly 25 percent of
the total foreign exchange expenditure, which was approved by
Iran's Parliament Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The parliament voted to approve the ceiling of 16.07 billion
dollars for foreign exchange expenditure of the Central Bank of
Iran.
</P>
<P>
Mohsen Nourbakhsh, Governor of the Central Bank of Iran, was
quoted by the Persian daily Salam as saying that Iran's external
debts total 20 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran is expected to earn a total of 19 billion
dollars of hard currency in 1997, of which 16 billion dollars
will come from oil and gas export, 2.5 to 3 billion dollars from
the exports of non-oil goods.
</P>
<P>
SANAA -- Yemeni Deputy Prime Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Attar
has said a giant gas project to be launched in mid-1997 would
greatly boost Yemen's economic development.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by al-Attar in an interview with Yemeni
newspaper Al-Thawra which was published today.
</P>
<P>
Al-Attar, who is also in charge of oil and gas affairs of the
country, said the 4.5-billion-dollar project includes extending a
320-kilometer pipeline from Maareb in the north to Belhalf on the
coast of Arabian Sea, setting up a gas factory at a cost of more
than 300 million U.S. dollars and constructing an exportation
terminal in Belhalf.
</P>
<P>
After completion, the project will provide enough energy to
operate two thermal power plants in Maareb and Belhalf with a
power ranging from 180 to 200 megawatts, the deputy prime
minister said.
</P>
<P>
He did not name the companies which had signed contracts to
launch the project, nor mentioned sources of the huge investment.
</P>
<P>
But he said exportation of the gas produced by the project
will start in the year 2001 at a rate of 5 million tonnes a
year. And Yemen has so far received orders from Turkey, Japan and
Korea to purchase its gas.
</P>
<P>
Yemen has recently signed agreements with British, Indonesian
and U.S. firms for searching and prospecting for oil in the
country.
</P>
<P>
According to reliable studies, Yemen's gas reserve ranges
between 13 and 15 trillion cubic feet. Yemen is thinking of
exporting liquefied gas to neighboring countries, such as
Somalia, Sudan and Djibouti after meeting domestic needs.
</P>
<P>
At current prices, Yemen will be able to obtain 500 million
U.S. dollars a year in oil revenues for 25 years.

JOHANNESBURG, January 22 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and Libya
have agreed that extra efforts should be made to find a lasting
solution to problems in the Great Lakes region, visiting Libyan
Foreign Minister Omar Mustafa Al-Muntasir said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Pretoria after meeting his South
African counterpart Alfred Nzo, Al-Muntasir said the crisis in
the Great Lakes region affected the whole continent, directly or

have a domino effect on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nzo said he assured Al-Muntasir that South Africa
was beginning to play some role in the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
To this end, Nzo said, his country will host a regional meeting
in Pretoria next Monday to discuss the conflict.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate approved
99-0 the nomination of Madeleine Albright as secretary of state
today, making her the highest-ranking woman in the history of U.S.
administrations.
</P>
<P>
The naturalized Czech-born woman was also the first of
President Bill Clinton's second-term Cabinet to pass Senate
muster.
</P>
<P>
No opposition was in sight during the two hours' debate and the
only member not voting on the nomination was Jay Rockefeller, a
Democrat senator.
</P>
<P>
Albright's swearing is expected as early as Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At a confirmation hearing on January 8 held by the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, Albright elaborated the U.S. foreign
policies in Clinton's second-term administration.
</P>
<P>
She advocated the expansion of NATO, saying NATO should not
preserve the eastern frontier as outlined at the age of the Cold
War.
</P>
<P>
"What NATO must and will do is keep open the door to membership
to every European nation," she told the Senate panel.
</P>
<P>
As regards China, Albright believed "a strong bilateral
relationship between the United States and China is needed," and
she promised to successfully manage U.S. multi-faceted
relationship with China.
</P>
<P>
She admitted there exist differences between the two countries
and she stressed the importance of acting towards each other on
the basis of mutual frankness.

<HEADLINE> EU Commission: EU Enlargement Unlikely Before 2002 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 22 (Xinhua) -- In contradistinction to
Franco-German eagerness to see the European Union (EU) absorb
central and eastern European countries, the European Commission
(EC) said today that no new country was likely to join before
2002.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac and Foreign Minister Herve de
Charette said recently that a target date of 2000 for enlargement
was achievable if there was "political will."
</P>
<P>
The EC -- charged with preparing the groundwork for talks with
10 applicant central and eastern European countries -- however,
predicted lengthy and complicated talks.
</P>
<P>
"Taking into account the possible duration of negotiations and
time needed for ratification, the earliest realistic date for the
first accessions is likely to be no earlier than 2002," it said in
a 30-point fact sheet on the EU's enlargement process.
</P>
<P>
Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary are generally regarded
as the most economically advanced applicants, with countries like
Bulgaria and Romania trying hard to catch up.
</P>
<P>
The three Baltic states -- Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania --
have also applied, along with Slovenia and Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
The commission is currently working on individual advice,
taking into account the political and economic situation in each
country.
</P>
<P>
It promised to unveil the advice "immediately after the
conclusion of the EU Inter-Governmental Conference on a new EU
treaty."
</P>
<P>
The treaty is scheduled to be concluded in June at the EU's
Amsterdam summit.

<HEADLINE> First Batch of Weevils Released into Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Kenya Agricultural Research
Institute (KARI) today released into Lake Victoria the first
batch of weevils to eradicate water hyacinth, the Kenya News
Agency (KNA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
KNA quoted KARI Deputy Director Andrew Mailu as saying in
Kisumu, western Kenya, that the release of the weevils was being
carried out at various identified sites around the lake.
</P>
<P>
He said that 35,000 eggs of the weevils have been incubated in
the water hyacinth plant at Kibos Research Center and will soon
be released into the lake together with adult weevils.
</P>
<P>
Mailu, who is also the chief researcher in the Water Hyacinth
Eradication Program at KARI, pointed out that after the initial
release, periodic releases will be carried out once every two
weeks with weevils from the rearing unit.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that 28 water tanks will soon be distributed to
various institutes such as Kenya Medical Research Institute and
Kenya Forestry Research Institute, which are considered as schools
for weevil breedings.
</P>
<P>
The current population of weevils will be greatly enhanced
after the tanks are distributed.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government is determined to eradicate the water
hyacinth in Lake Victoria by using biological method, which is
considered to be more efficient than chemicals.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has agreed to provide about 70 million U.S.
Dollars through the Global Environment Facility to Kenya, Uganda
and Tanzania to eradicate the weed.
</P>
<P>
The Lake Victoria, the world's second largest fresh water
lake, is threatened with a number of ecological problems,
particularly the fast-spreading weed of water hyacinth.

<HEADLINE> Sterling to Maintain Strength: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The British currency pound will
stay firm or appreciate further in this quarter, according to a
survey of chief foreign exchange dealers published Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The survey, carried out by the trade publication Foreign
Exchange Letter in the second week of this month, said that more
than half of the dealers polled believed sterling would show "no
significant change" against the U.S. currency dollar over the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
Another 30 percent forecast a rise in the pound/dollar rate,
from its present level of 1.66 U.S. dollars to above 1.73 U.S.
dollars. Only nine of the 47 dealers surveyed forecast that
sterling would fall against the Deutsche mark.
</P>
<P>
The dealers predicted that the strong British economy and
relatively high UK interest rates would help the pound hold its
recent gains against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they said that the market's nervousness before
Britain's general election, which must be held by May, would do
little to weaken the pound.
</P>
<P>
Sterling has risen 14 percent against a trade-weighted basket
of currencies since early August last year, hitting UK exports and
prompting profit warnings on the London Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriot Leader Ends Visit to Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktas today warned again the Cypriot government not to try
to change the balance of power on Cyprus at the end of his
three-day visit to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Denktas reaffirmed that the continued arms build-up by the
Cypriot government would lead to Turkey's powerful counterblow,
according to the Anatolia news agency.
</P>
<P>
He said it was time to take a firm stance against Greek
Cypriots, adding that they, backed by the Greek government, had
systematically undermined the peace process of the island.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he called on the international community to take note
of the hostile actions taken by the Cypriot government, saying
that the only obstacle in the path of a peaceful settlement on
the island was the Cypriot government's reluctance to recognize
Turkish Cypriots as equal partners.
</P>
<P>
Denktas arrived here Monday to discuss with the Turkish
leaders the Cypriot government's purchase of Russian-made S-300
surface-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and northern Cyprus signed a joint declaration Monday to
show their unity in confronting an alleged military threat from
the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
In the five-page strongly-worded document, Turkey said that
any military attack against northern Cyprus would be considered
as an attack against Turkey itself.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Turkish Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan
disclosed that Turkish warships would visit ports of
northern Cyprus soon to show Turkey's determination to block the
deployment of missiles.
</P>
<P>
The situation on the east Mediterranean island remains tense
since the Cypriot government contracted to buy Russian
anti-aircraft missiles with a range of 150 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has warned that it would not hesitate to hit these
offensive weapons if the Cypriot government continued to go ahead
with the program.
</P>
<P>
The island of Cyprus has been split into two parts since 1974
when the Turkish troops occupied the northern third of the island
following an abortive coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with
Greece.
</P>
<P>
At present, some 35,000 Turkish troops are stationed on the
strategic island to protect Turkish Cypriots.
